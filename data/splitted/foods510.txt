review/summary: Bring back the original taste
review/text: The sugar police strike again and ruin a oatmeal taste that was always selling out in my local supermarket... Now the huge flakes and horrid taste has made me an ex-Quaker consumer. There are plenty of choices out there for low sugar oatmeals why screw around with this classic, or why not just make another version and leave this one alone?<br /><br />Horrible

review/summary: Quaker hear our PLEA!!! CHANGE IT BACK!
review/text: This shows an older box but from what I can tell the dates of these reviews and the fact they mention the lower sugar and horrible new taste I assume they are selling the 'Lower Sugar, Heartier Texture, and New Great Taste" boxes. They changed it all. It is horrible. Please Quaker change it back! You already had a High Fiber MBS and another one that is 50% less sugar MBS and a Weight COntrol MBS----but you HAD to mess with the original?! I have ate this for almost 40 years. Not anymore. I have to go to store brands now. Please change it back. Oh and if you want to join the movement Hehe...go to FBook and join, 'Change quaker maple and brown sugar oatmeal back' or something like that. There are a few groups on Fbk. Also go to the discussion site on the official Quaker Oatmeal Fbook page---there you can add to the disgruntled unhappy customers that Quaker has upset. Many discussions there on this.

review/text: I thought it was just me, but now I see that I'm not the only one who hates the new version.  The original recipe had such a delicious aroma, this one smells and tastes artificial.  I have to resort to adding my own brown sugar and maple syrup, but it's still not right.  I will be trying another brand - McCann's Maple & Brown Sugar as someone suggested.  Bad move Quaker Oats.

review/text: The new formulation tastes horrible.  I would be interested to see a chart of their sales before and after implementation because their responses to the long time consumers is that "product testers" like the new formulation.  I would like to know if the "product testers" are buying the product because from these reviews the "long time consumers"...like myself...are not.  I have two boxes at home that i would not feed to my dog.  you suppose it would make a good facial...no it smells terrible also.  maybe wallpaper paste.

review/text: My kids used to LOVE Quaker Instant Oatmeal. It was a quick way to get them a hot breakfast on a busy morning and still get them to school on time. They started refusing to eat it, and would leave their bowls mostly full and uneaten. They said it tasted "funny". I tried a bite, and sure enough. I thought it had spoiled, so threw out the whole box, and bought a "fresh" box next time I was at the store. Nope, the flavor was terrible in the new box as well. Bad, bad move, Quaker. Go back to the old flavor formulas before you lose this line of business altogether.

I did nto realize there was something different about the box, but I could tell when I ate it.  Something just wasnt right.  It made me examine the box only to find that the oatmeal isnt enriched with the vitamins it had and has less sugar.  Whatever they did - the new one is horrible and I am not searching for store brands to replaced my beloved breakfast.

review/text: Unlike the McDonald's oatmeal, which made headlines for having more sugar than a Snickers bar, this version is quite healthy, with only 12 grams of sugar per serving.

review/text: Running off to work without breakfast?<br /><br />Sometimes a product is just right for the consumer.<br /><br />When my daughter-in-law noticed my box of Quaker instant oatmeal maple and brown sugar, she told me her children, age four and two, love it.<br /><br />So many children skip breakfast and the Quaker Oatmeal gives a person fuel to start the day with energy.<br /><br />It's also good because it has zero saturated fat and is only 160 calories per packet. It's so tasty that it doesn't need anything to add to the flavor but sliced peaches or blueberries are a nice touch.<br /><br />Since the product comes in handy packets, it's also convenient to bring to work and have a quick, energetic snack, all that's needed is to add milk or boiling water and it's all set.<br /><br />It's also microwavable. This is a very good product.

It used to be wonderful but now is not fit to feed my cat. ( I tried but she wouldn't eat it, either ) Worst stuff I ever tasted when it comes to oatmeal.

review/text: This Quaker instant oatmeal tastes good, however in order to truly feel like you have had a fulfilling meal, you need at least two of the packets as a serving. I brought this to work so I would have something to eat when I forgot to bring my breakfast in. It is a little dry and the consistency is like that of paste, so I tend to add a little half and half just before serving to make it a little creamier.<br /><br />It is okay in a pinch, but not something that I would want to consume on a daily basis.

Growing up, mom used to buy the variety packs of Quaker Oatmeal, which always included Maple and Brown Sugar. The other night, our dinner plan went south and I needed something filling. I saw the box on the counter and grabbed. Couple packs in the bowl, some milk and about a minute in the microwave and I was set to go. It was all warm, a bit runny as I prefer it. With that maply and sugar sweet flavor that I miss from growing up.

review/summary: Not The Same Product of Years Past, Bust Still Good For A Fast, Hot Breakfast
review/text: In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch.

review/summary: Tasty, great for camping or fast breakfasts
review/text: I always find the Maple & Brown Sugar more tasty than making plain oatmeal with maple syrup and brown sugar myself. Why is that? Regardless, these instant oatmeal packs have been a staple breakfast for numerous camping trips -- just add hot water and it's ready to eat. I tend to stick to the plain quick oats in the cardboard cylinder for most breakfasts, but I occasionally splurge on these instant packs for normal weekday breakfasts as well. It's fast to prepare and keeps me feeling full for a few hours.

review/text: Like most instant oatmeal, this ended up being a lot like baby cereal in texture and way too thin if you don't cut back on the amount of water called for.  One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture.

review/summary: Making Oatmeal Edible
review/text: It's hard to believe that these might actually be healthy, but I love these flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals.<br /><br />And they might actually be healthy! Though sugar is the second ingredient, whole grain rolled oats is the first ingredient in every flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal, including this Maple Brown Sugar, which is a favorite of mine. Further, each serving (one packet) contains only four grams of sugar in the low sugar form and nine grams in the regular form, which is one to two teaspoons.<br /><br />Yeah, one or two teaspoons.<br /><br />I went through the rest of the ingredients on the Maple Brown Sugar flavor and on several others, and almost every other ingredient is an ingredient you'd find in a vitamin pill. The Apples & Cinnamon even has dehydrated apples (ahead of sugar, which is the third ingredient in that flavor).<br /><br />I'm recovering from chemotherapy and radiation. I had a bone marrow transplant in January (2012), and my new immune system sometimes goes after my gut when we lower my immunosuppressives. Thus, eating food that is high in fiber and gentle on the stomach and intestines is important for me. It's important for you, too, because the fiber in oats is excellent for your heart.<br /><br />The problem is, it's hard for me to find oatmeal edible without adding a lot more brown sugar than Quaker does! That's always been true, but it's especially true when I'm recovering from leukemia treatments. At first, there was a VERY limited set of food items I could eat without throwing up. (Sorry for being so graphic.) These flavored Quaker Instant Oatmeals let me eat gentle, heart-healthy oatmeal without hating the flavor. I love almost every one. They're a go-to food for me when I'm nauseous.<br /><br />I know you probably aren't recovering from a blood cancer, but if you're wanting to eat oatmeal because it's healthy, this is a great way to eat it.<br /><br />And for lazy people, it's a one-bowl cleanup. Pour the packet in the bowl, pour boiling water over it, and wait a minute (or less if you're impatient like me). Eat it, and you have one bowl and no pots to wash (or throw in the dishwasher).

review/summary: Tasty and mostly healthful, but beware the caramel color
review/text: Oatmeal is said to lower cholesterol and benefit the heart. That's one thing to like about Quaker Instant Oatmeal. This particular brand -- Maple & Brown Sugar -- also claims "whole grains" oats, no trans fats, and no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />That's all good. It also tastes good, heats quickly, and has good consistency whether one uses milk or water.<br /><br />Yet it's not perfect. It's not as healthful as pure oats (of whatever brand), by which I mean no ingredients other than oats.<br /><br />This one contains various "artificial flavors" and chemicals. That includes caramel color. I heard a radio report claiming that some people now believe that caramel color may cause some cancers.<br /><br />So check whatever you buy for caramel color. Lots of bread and cereal products contain it. In this case, I suppose the caramel color is to help create the "brown sugar" look for this product.<br /><br />The ingredients actually list "sugar," but not "brown sugar." Maybe it's all the same, but loses its brown color under certain conditions, hence, the use of caramel color.<br /><br />This is still a mostly healthful, and tasty product. But look for oats with nothing other than oats if you want the oats' maximum health benefits.<br /><br />If you still prefer buying one of Quaker's "flavored" instant oatmeals, I suggest one of the Cinnamon flavored ones. Cinnamon is said to stabilize blood sugar levels and help prevent adult onset diabetes. Cinnamon is more healthful than Brown Sugar.

review/summary: A healthy, hot breakfast product.
review/text: Okay, it's just oatmeal. Actually, it's more than that. Firstly, Quaker is a maker of quality products and has been known for quality for generations. Secondly, oatmeal is a very heart-healthy food that can help reduce cholesterol. Thirdly, for all its benefits, it is a very inexpensive choice for a healthy breakfast (or midnight snack!).<br /><br />I like oatmeal and have since childhood. This product (in delicious maple, brown sugar flavor) tastes good and, unlike many of the generic products, you can taste the maple as well as the brown sugar. The flavorings are well distributed throughout the product and every bite provides good taste as well as nutrition.<br /><br />This is a quality product at a good price. What's not to like?

review/summary: The best instant oatmeal on the market
review/text: I've been eating Quaker oatmeal most of my life, and the maple syrup and brown sugar version of their instant oatmeal breakfast is one of my favorites. It's simple to make, either add hot water, or microwave it. I tend to microwave it, which tends to give the oats more body. It has the right mix of syrup and sugar taste, and I don't need to add anything at all for taste. Just love this as an anytime snack.

review/summary: Classic & Tasty
review/text: There is one thing I do love is classic food in the morning. Oatmeal has never stopped changing with the times, yet there are some traditions that have never died. Quaker has been no exception. They have made great tasting oatmeal for generations that is still as delightful today, as it was back then. Their classic Maple & Brown Sugar hasn't changed since it was introduced in instant oatmeal for decades. The taste is absolutely a joy to have every morning. It is simple to make with a simple pot of boiling water, and you get a classic treat in your morning breakfast. If you have never tried Quaker's Oatmeal, or even had Maple & Brown Sugar Oatmeal before, you do know what you're missing, especially on those cold winter mornings. I definitely recommend Quaker's oatmeal, and this is a great flavor.<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Taste: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+

Mix it with hot milk for an extra creamy and filling oatmeal. I actually thought I was getting the reformulated version because I've been wanting to try the low sugar version just for a healthier option.

review/summary: What happened???
review/text: When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome.

These instant packs take virtually no time and you don't have to mess with extra ingredients like brown sugar and maple extract, etc. They come in many different flavors and if you like oatmeal and you like brown sugar, this is a quick and easy way to satisfy your morning hunger.

They're ready in mere minutes, quite filling, and the taste is not bad--I find Quaker brand far tastier than any generic or store brand I've tried. Maple brown sugar, along with apple cinammon, is among my faves. Add half a banana, and maybe some strawberries, and you have a high energy meal that leaves you feeling full and satisfied for hours. Great for the price and convenience.

Granted, this oatmeal does not have the hard lump of brown sugar in the corner of the packet, as I seem to remember from my childhood in the 1970's. But it hardly tastes so bad that I can't eat it. I thought it was fine. Maybe it is not as sweet as it was years ago, but I can't see any ingredient listed on the package that would in any case render the taste as bad as some have said. Add more brown sugar if you want to eat candy... and get over it!

review/text: The maple and brown sugar combination seems about the right balance for the two but the amount overall covers the oat flavor.  Perhaps it is my personal preference for very little sugar but overall I was disappointed.  With many flavors of instant oats, the Quaker oats are far superior to the competition.  I am not able to detect a great difference in this flavor from many of the cheap store-brand varieties I have tried.  It is acceptable for an occasional variety in breakfast but nothing that sets it apart from others.

review/text: I always enjoyed the apple cinnamon the best, but if I had to pick a second flavor - this was it.  To me the flavor was more similar to maple syrup when I was a kid, but not overly sweet.  Now it seems like the sweetness is still there but it tastes more like just sugar not the maple.  In fact the opening of the packet didn't even smell that much like maple making me think I accidentally picked up the wrong kind.  But overall the healthy side is still there and the taste is plenty good, just wished it reminded me a little more of the Maple & Brown Sugar I remember.  For the money, I really shouldn't complain - and I would use the maple comments to deter me from buying this again.  There aren't very many fast, healthy, cheap foods out there - thank goodness this one is.

review/text: Quaker's Maple and Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal is adequate oatmeal and should appeal to you if you like your oatmeal sweeter than average.  For you - 4 stars.  For everybody else - 3.<br /><br />I've been eating oatmeal almost every breakfast for 11 years.  Over that time I've gradually used less and less sweetener.  So the sweetness of M&BS is a little much for me - however the maple flavor and smell is strong and pleasant and that goes a long way towards making up for it.<br /><br />Preparation is easy enough.  Add water, nuke it for 90 seconds, done.  Regular oatmeal isn't much harder but these packets are handy if you're going to eat in the office or on the road.

review/text: Instant oatmeal is my go-to breakfast whenever I have to work the very early morning shift.  I just pour the packet into a mug and add hot water from the dispenser on the coffee maker.  Quaker's Maple Brown Sugar is pretty good, but I think the Safeway brand is just a little tastier.  Quaker's version just doesn't have quite enough brown sugar in my opinion.  Since I had a box of Safeway's, I decided to compare.  They're pretty similar with the same calories and grams of fat, but when it comes to nutrients the Safeway version is slightly more nutritious.  For example, Quaker has 15% Vitamin A and 8% Calcium while Safeway has 20% Vitamin A and 10% Calcium.  Going down the list, Safeway is either equal to or better in each category.

review/summary: Slightly artificial flavor, but still eatable.
review/text: As the title states, the main fault with this oatmeal is the artificial maple flavor. It's slight, but leaves an odd taste in my mouth. I mean, oatmeal is healthy and good in itself; why add that extra artificial sugar if it detracts from the overall taste of the food? In this case brown sugar would have been enough. Or at least use real maple syrup.<br /><br />Texture and consistency is up to you, based on how much water you put in and how long you cook it. I put in different amounts of water and I thought the oatmeal tasted best with more water. My guess is that the water diluted the strong sugary taste so that it was more palatable to me. I still give this product 4 stars, because most flavored instant oatmeal have this issue of using artificial ingredients that affect the taste.<br /><br />Ultimately, after trying different kinds of flavored instant oatmeal from various companies, I think I enjoy plain oatmeal with dried or fresh berries the most. Healthy and good, what more can you ask?

review/summary: Never an oatmeal fan, I love this stuff
review/text: I grew up at a time when we had the paper canister of Quaker Oatmeal that could/should have been stuck away for desperation use, such as in a bomb shelter. Although some oatmeal would hit the spot sometimes(especially at summer camp, with some butter, brown sugar, and raisins), I came to loath oatmeal so much that I don't even like oatmeal cookies.<br />Imagine my surprise when on a road trip in Idaho and Montana, my best friend pulled a Tupperware container stuffed with various flavors of Quaker Instant Oatmeal out of her camping box, and when I groaned, she said "Never leave home without it". We pumped up some water, heated it on the Coleman, and voila! Had no milk, sigar, or anything, and it hit the spot, and for a quick and filling snack, it still does. Love the Brown Sugar, and most of the other varieties are good, too. I recently found a Cinnamon Roll flavor at Grocery Outlet that was killer.<br />So, bottom line, like my friend, I'm now in "don't leave home without it" mode, and carry a quart Zip-loc of Quaker Instant Oatmeal in my glove box. You never know when you'll need it.

review/summary: Oatmeal and all of its varieties
review/text: Oatmeal has been a simple breakfast meal for centuries, but what brand comes to mind when it comes to one brand of cereal?  Quaker Oats, with its simple preparation of either boiling a pot of hot water or placing a bowl with the contents of oatmeal and water into the microwave, instant oatmeal cereal.  Who can ask for anything more in a breakfast cereal?  For the most part, the cereal provides the necessary dietary needs one may be seeking for to start the day.  Quaker Oats has the essential ingredients, low in saturated fat and well for one's heart health and cholesterol, vitamins and minerals, and it taste good.<br /><br />For example, Quaker Oats carries a variety of flavors, but for consumers wanting to try the cereal beyond the basic oatmeal, the maple and brown sugar flavor may be enticing.  It does not taste as sweet as it sounds, and by adding a few fresh fruits to the mix, sliced bananas, apples, or strawberries or any other variety, one has a meal during the morning hours.  After consuming all 10-packets, most likely, one may want to try other flavors.

review/summary: Too much sugar
review/text: I thought this flavor was a little bland, nothing close to my favorite of raisins, dates, and walnuts.  The oats were fine.  I like that these instant oatmeals are great for on the go and are a better fast breakfast option than most cold, sugary cereals.  My biggest problem with this oatmeal is the sugar content.  Although one packet might be fine for a toddler, anyone over 8 years old would probably need two packets for breakfast; however, with 12 grams of sugar in one packet, that means a two-packet breakfast gives you a whopping 24 grams of sugar!  A better option is to make a bowl of oatmeal, not instant, add less sugar or a sugar substitute, then add spices or other ingredients of your choice. It takes a little more time and effort, but the result is a better tasting, healthier oatmeal.

review/summary: What You Expect from a Company with the Last Name "Oats"
review/text: I don't eat eggs, so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for breakfast.  Maple Brown Sugar is one of my "go to" flavors - it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name brands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.<br /><br />There really is no comparison.  The store brands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three-dimensional, and the brown sugar is just enough.<br /><br />Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon.

Oatmeal is the ultimate in comfort food, and maple conjures up the same type of coziness. Combine both, nuke for two minutes in the microwave, and you have an amazingly quick breakfast or snack.  It isn't the heartiest oatmeal, but the addition of a banana and or raisins bulks it up considerably, and makes it a more complete balanced meal or snack. I actually like to mush up my banana and heated in the microwave as well, then mix it into the oatmeal; the result is terrific.

I like making it in the microwave, but it does tend to boil over, but now I use the Keurig-type coffee maker to make two packets at once. Works like a charm. Maple and brown sugar are definitely on my list of favorites, and when I really want a treat, I put in a dab of butter. Oatmeal is one of my comfort foods, and instant is a lot less work. Of course, if you like the texture of steel-cut oats, this may not be worth it, but it is for me.

review/summary: The good ol' Classic Recipe that I grew up with
review/text: YES!  Quaker went back to the old recipe!  Woohoo!  I do love this stuff.  This Maple Brown Sugar flavor is what I grew up eating.  I am unfortunately a picky eater, nothing else will do, I'm very sensitive to (and grossed-out by) new flavors and textures.<br /><br />A year or two ago Quaker had scrapped the old recipe and came out with a New & Improved recipe which I unwittingly tried and was repulsed, thinking I'd gotten a bad batch until I realized it had been reformulated.  The new version's hearty oats and natural flavor wasn't a hit with me.  I emailed Quaker with my complaint and they nicely sent me a $5 coupon to use on any Quaker product which I used for Life cereal.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess I wasn't the only one complaining about the New & Improved recipe because now Quaker has returned to their tried 'n' true Classic Recipe.  Now I have my old Maple Brown Sugar flavor and texture back.  Sure, it's probably not as healthy for me as old-fashioned homecooked oats, but I don't like old-fashioned oats.  =)  The flavor and texture of this instant oatmeal is comfort food to me, and since I have orthodontic braces, it's a good food for me to eat when my teeth are aching.

review/summary: Quaker Instant Oatmeal
review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal is such a healthy and filling breakfast.  I like to start my day with a five mile run and when I come home this is my breakfast of choice, especially in the winter.  My favorite way to fix it is by dumping a packet of oatmeal, 1/2 cup of water and I always add 2 tablespoons of Old Fashion Oats too.  Cook it for a minute and then add cinnamon, raisins and milk.  It is sweet and healthy--a great mix!  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to eat healthy foods, yet has a sweet tooth.

review/summary: Tasty, not too sweet, easy to prepare
review/text: Quaker Instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is a hearty dish for breakfast.  It's tasty, filling, and easy to prepare.  The ease of preparation is important for working folks who don't want to rush to work with an empty stomach.  Combined with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, the oatmeal will definitely hold and fortify you until lunch.<br /><br />It also makes for a good snack, instead of overly salty and sugar-rich foods.  I know many people put sugar and milk in their oatmeal, but I'm a purest.  I enjoy it just plain.  It's sweet enough to tingle one's taste buds, but not so sweet as to make it feel as if you're eating candy.  Instant foods suffer a generally bad reputation.  When "ease of preparation" is a primary consideration, often flavor suffers.  Not so here.  There was plenty of maple flavor.<br /><br />There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15-second nuke in the microwave.  The result was perfect for me.  If this sounds like too much preparation, stick with one of the prescribed methods, listed on the box.<br /><br />I'm not a really devoted oatmeal eater, so I may not be the ultimate authority on this product.  My review is based on the flavor (quite pleasant), preparation time (swift), and texture (just right, not too watery, not lumpy).  As with any food, individual taste is a major factor.

It's still available for purchase and tastes MUCH better than this version.  Skip the box with the picture of the fitness guru giving you 'super' advice and go for the original.  I have no idea what they did to this version but the taste is horrible and very noticeable when you've had the version I've mentioned above.  It's edible, but so are some varieties of garbage, not recommended.

review/text: I have to admit, when I saw this available on vine I thought it may be a new twist on a classic product but it's not. It's the same oatmeal that we have had for many years. This is my favorite flavor of all the varieties. The only issues I have always had with these instant pouches is the amount of sugar in them and the serving size. Way to sweet for my tastes. and not enough. There is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EPQVBM">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar</a> available but even that is a bit to sweet for me. What I usually do is use 1 pouch of flavored oatmeal and 1 pouch of plain <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001M09BQQ">Quaker Instant Oatmeal Original</a> and that fixes all my problems and it's just perfect. Fills me up and it's not overly sweet. I wish they sold these in bulk without the pouches. If I could get 2 pound cans of each I would be set!<br /><br />I received this product free of charge to try through the vine program.<br />Would I spend my own money on this? Yes.

review/text: I should probably have realized that Maple AND Brown Sugar would make for a sweet product... but I figured maybe they used both in moderation. I was wrong.<br /><br />But adding a little milk cuts down the sweetness without watering down the oatmeal. This is still a much better bowl of oatmeal than my local supermarket store brand (and there's more oatmeal per packet), and I actually like it better than McCann's, which I have always found to be a little slimy.

review/summary: Easy to make, keeps me full, but the taste could be better
review/text: I microwave it for 70 seconds to cook it then splash it with a little milk to cool it off enough to eat. The taste isn't horrible, but it isn't fantastic, either. I also got the cinnamon spice one and I think that one tastes a tad better (but still not great). I threw some table sugar on it and that made a world of difference in the taste though I had to sacrifice some nutritional value in order to make it so.<br /><br />One thing I did like is that one serving keeps me full, which is actually something I find difficult in most foods. It holds me over for 4-5 hours while I'm usually hungry after eating most meals in a couple of hours. I've lost three pounds since starting this ten days ago without much of a change to my workout routine. I'm thinking it is the oatmeal.<br /><br />If the taste got better, this product would be GOLDEN!!!

review/summary: Tasty, but I wouldn't call it "wholesome".
review/text: Just finishing off a bowl (3 packets) of Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar. Its very quick to make, either using fat free milk or water and then microwaving it. Prep time is about 3 minutes. The taste is very good. It's very sweet-about as sweet as the sweetest breakfast cereal. It has a strong maple flavor.<br /><br />I would not go so far as to call this a "wholesome" breakfast. A cereal bowl serving-an adult serving that is (3 packets), has about 33% (260mg) of your entire daily sodium intake and a ton of sugar. The sodium upper limit for persons under 51 years of age is 2500 mg per day and for those over 51 or have heart disease the upper limit is only 1500mg. That means that this product isn't quite the 'heart healthy' food Pepsico (Yes) claims it to be. None-the-less, it is a fairly good alternative to many of the breakfast cereals available and probably healthier than a bacon and eggs breakfast. It is however, no substitute for homemade oatmeal in flavor or sodium/sugar content.

review/summary: artificial flavor, says it all
review/text: Okay, I don't ever buy instant oatmeal like this, we buy bulk organic quick oats and add brown sugar. I have always found instant oatmeal in the little packs to not have good flavor despite all the additives and I always want to add more sugar to make it taste better.  For the most part this oatmeal lived up to my expectations.  I will admit that compared to other maple flavored brands I've tried this one was better, but still, I would not buy this again, and one of my daughters said she didn't like it and won't eat it again, glad I only got one box.  We use genuine maple syrup in our household, and even keep maple sugar for sprinkling on toast, so we are big maple fans, and I guess with genuine maple fans artificial flavor just doesn't cut it.  I even felt like it wasn't quite sweet enough even though it had more sugar in it than the Cinnamon and Spice flavor oatmeal.  Because it has better flavor than other brands of maple flavored oatmeal I've tried, I gave it a 3 stars, saying it was OK is about right.

Oatmeal isn't very exciting, but it's easy to add some frozen fruit to it. The fruit thaws rapidly and adds some appeal.

review/summary: Recipe Changed - Bland
review/text: Oatmeal has become a daily staple of my diet. Most days I just start from the plain oatmeal and add brown sugar and raisins.  But every once in awhile I like to splurge on the pre-packaged oatmeal like I used to eat as a kid.  Sure the sugar is a little higher but nutritionally it's a much better option than other snacks. Only 160 calories per packet. Quaker instant oatmeal packets are just as good as you remember them. If there were any way to improve this product it would be to make the oatmeal a little thicker.  More like rolled oats.  Other than that,  Quaker Maple and Brown Sugar oatmeal is awesome.<br /><br />26JUL12 REVISED RATING: My kids tell me this oatmeal is really bland compared to what they are used too.  Tasted fine to me but the kids didn't like it at all.

review/text: I wanted to try these peanut noodles because it sounded like they might be easier to make then the other boxed kind we've been using.  Initially I was a bit disappointed because it advised to pour in 1 cup water into noodes and dry mix, microwave 90 seconds, then drain off excess water, then add peanuts and sauce.  I didn't like having to pour off water, too messy and potential for me to burn myself.  But after a couple rounds I am able to improve procedure (for me, anyway) and instead I do this:  place noodes and dry mix into bowl (I cut up the noodles to fit into bowl better, optional!); pour in some water from the hot pot, I'm guessing approximately 1/4 cup, microwave 1 minute, stir, add sauce and peanuts, microwave 30 seconds.  Same or better results as Chun's own directions, but no messy pour-off of boiling water involved.

I thought maybe my silverware was contaminated with some cleaning agent, but today with a different set of silverware and a different lot number for the noodles, I noticed the lemon taste was still there.<br /><br />Comparing the ingredients from an older package, it looks like Annie Chun's changed the recipe for the peanut/sesame sauce. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as tasty as it used to be. Because of this, it no longer worth keeping a subscription.

You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.

review/summary: Unpredictable Quality
review/text: Our first order of this was fresh and tasty. We also enjoyed the versatility of switching out the noodles for brown rice, and tossing with sauteed chunks of chicken breast with either broccoli or fresh spinach.  Thought we had a winner.<br /><br />But then, an order arrived with two of the noodle packets punctured with the noodles growing green, fuzzy mold all over.  Disgusting.<br /><br />Then the most recent order, June 2012, arrived with rancid sauce and rancid peanuts unfit for consumption.<br />Now we're not sure if we're game to try our luck with these any further. Probably not.<br /><br />As the for the spicy heat some people mention--it's really great, and we actually add a few drops of "hot" seasoned sesame oil right right before serving to make it even hotter, more intense and more enjoyable.<br /><br />The problem is the unpredictable quality control.

review/summary: Annie Chun's Peanut Sesame Noodle Bowl
review/text: I am in the process of trying all of the Annie Chun's Soup Noodle Bowls and Noodle Bowls. Of all the ones I bought I tried these first because these are the ones that I actually wanted to like the best. They were AWFUL !! Very overpowering lemony taste. I tried to eat them but could not even finish them. Now, you have to understand something, I am really not very picky as far as food is concerned. If I dont like something, I usually can pretty much finish it because I hate wasting food but I actually threw these away. I was so disappointed !! Since then I have tried a couple of the other noodle bowls and a soup bowl and have really liked them so it isnt the Annie Chun's products but this particular noodle bowl. I have read a couple of the more recent reviews on this product on Amazon and their facebook page and was relieved to see it wasnt just me. That other people had noticed this overpowering lemony taste. Seems they havent always been like this though. One gentleman stated that he had compaired the ingredient label of a new batch and an old batch and it seems they have changed some of the ingredients. Annie, if you read this, go back to the old way because pretty soon no one is going to be buying these.

review/text: I was not expecting this to be so spicey and hot. I wish they could find a way to label these so people with digestive problems would have a way of knowing before we order. I am rather new to Amazon.com, so maybe I missed something. If you like hot and spicey with a good flavor, you will like this.

review/summary: Pretty good!
review/text: Bought this at the supermarket because it was on sale. Very pleasantly surprised! I think it tastes as good as any standard take-out joint.  Good flavor and texture with a little kick. The prep is a *little* more complicated than your average microwave meal, but definitely worth it.

review/summary: Great quick noodle bowl
review/text: This one and the Miso noodle bow are favorites in our house.  Both are mild kid pleasers.  This one comes in at three times the calories of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E123IC">Annie Chun's Miso Soup Noodle Bowl, 5.4-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 6)</a>  though.  Its a very hearty serving size, and is a slightly sour sauce.  My son likes an extra spoonful of peanut butter stirred in -- I totally second K Vandette's review, the quick way, start with hot water  I use our insta hot tap) microwave for a minute, stir and add the other ingredients and microwave for another 30 secs to a minute.<br /><br />Tastes great and is super fast for your kid that has to get some place with minutes to spare :-)

review/summary: Surprised pleasantly and amazed.
review/text: I was a little hesitant about ordering these as I am not a big fan of packaged food like this. But I was completely taken back when I made one for lunch.<br /><br />The preparation is so easy and simple and it takes like 90 seconds!<br /><br />The bowls are surprisingly sturdy even after the minute and half in the microwave. The noodles were vacuum sealed and again, surprisingly fresh. I was worried about a stale or bland taste, but I was wrong.<br /><br />After the microwaving was done, and I was able to eat, I was yet again, surprised. The flavor is great... it's got a little zip / bite / spiciness to it but it's just enough for those who don't like spicy foods. I LOVE spicy foods and this was still enough for me to accept openly without being bland.<br /><br />These are the best bowls I've tried thus far. To be better than Annie Chun's, you'd have to go A LONG ways and do some amazing things because these are nearly unbeatable. I highly recommend these.<br /><br />I will DEFINITELY be ordering more of these and many other flavors as well.

review/summary: Unique savory flavor
review/text: I've tried all the vegetarian Taste of Thai boxed noodle products and all the vegetarian Annie Chun noodle bowls. This is by far the best and one of the few in which the sauce combines with the noodles to create a unique flavor. It's deeply savory (umami) and unlike most anything I've tasted as a vegetarian. I could eat these every day.

review/text: NOt the flavor I was expecting but, is OK if you are in a super hurry and have no other options. But, the taste of the flour in the noodles is kind of odd and it is a rather small portion. If you spice it up with garlic and ginger, it is not half bad.

review/text: These are easy to make in the microwave but do require opening 4 separate packages of noodles, sauces, peanuts, and flavorings. It taste pretty good, good enough for 4 out of 5 stars. I would consider buying them again.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: It was a little spicier than I expected, but I like that.  You can save yourself work by only adding 1 1/2 packets of water to the noodles and vegetable packet mixture and microwaving for the  directed time.  Then you do not have to drain the water out before adding the yummy peanut sauce and peanuts. My second order is already shipping.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and filling.
review/text: None of these instant bowls comes anywhere close to fresh local food, but this one is not bad at all.  Though a bit more fuss to prepare than some, it's worth it, as this bowl definitely tastes better than most I've tried.  Also, the whole bowl is enough to satisfy a man for lunch or a quick dinner. However, high in caloroies and sodium, so I would not eat them too often.  (The package says that a "bowl" is two servings, very misleading, but what can you do? So remember to double those nutritional numbers!)<br /><br />You get enough peanuts to matter and they tasted good.  The sauce was good.  The "cook and rinse with hot water" method they use means the noddles aren't too oily like some I've tried.  And the bits of vegetable, while sparse, help some.<br /><br />Easy to make, noodles are very good, tastes is good, price is fair.  Thumbs up!<br /><br />Update 2012-02-17: These have gone up in price since my review.

review/summary: calories
review/text: I am usually careful about checking the calories before I order because I'm on a calorie-restricted diet.  I looked at the nutritional information and I don't believe that I read it wrong; 280 calories.  It NOW says each serving is 0.5 bowl.  I'm not going to bet money it wasn't there before but I've looked at a million nutritional printouts so I don't think so.  In any case, it arrives and now I realize it's 600 calories per bowl.  About 1/3 the calorie requirement of a medium-sized woman per day.  Much more than a caramel mocha with whipped cream at McDonalds.  So, if I want to eat them it will be few and far between.  They are good.  I like the texture of the noodles.  But for those calories I can get a hamburger and large fries.<br /><br />If the 0.5 bowl equal to one serving was there before I apologize.  hummmmm.

review/summary: Peanut Sesame Noodle Bowl
review/text: I was initially excited to buy this product as I love noodles and peanuts. However the noodles are disappointing. They are clumped together in a separate packet but the noodles do not separate well and tend to stay together almost doughy or gluey. First I made them according to instructions and was disappointed. The second time I put the noodles in boiling water first and that helped a bit but was still problematic. I later added the noodles and the other packets to sauteed vegetables. The taste was really good, but the problem is the noodles! Maybe dried noodles would be better as they would not stick together.

review/summary: Fatty!  Caution.  Compare to Simply Asian
review/text: This particular Auntie Chun's has 20 grams of fat, 5 grams of which are saturated fat.<br /><br />This is not much healthier than Nissan fried Ramen.<br /><br />Simply Asian noodles have 1 gram of fat!  One gram per whole serving!  And the servings are the same size, and the taste is just as vibrant and lovely as this Auntie Chuns.  I, personally, won't be buying Auntie CHun's again, and wanted others interested in nutrition to notice this startling difference.<br /><br />Quality of product and taste is same, essentially, Auntie CHuns and Simply Asian.  I get the Teriyaki noodles or the Pad Thai Simply Asian.<br /><br />Healthy living to you all!

review/text: I looked for the nutrition information and could not find it on Amazon.  Since I love Sesame noodles I bought this product.  On the box it does say 40 carbs, I shoulda paid attention - one bowl kicked my blood sugar level up by nearly 80 points - way above what it should be.  If you are diabetic avoid this product.

review/summary: Yummy Weight Loss?
review/text: OK - So I admit, I bought this for the possibility to lose weight with zero effort. I am not overweight at all but have ZERO muscle and a few curves I am not proud of. Anyway, my hopes were low but I figured I would have a healthy caffeinated tea in the long-run. So I have been drinking it for 2-3 weeks now and I don't think the scale is lying but I have lost about 5 lbs. Now, I understand that many factors could have caused this but I am pretty sure my eating habits have stayed the same. I still don't drink coffee or soda and I definitely don't exercise. I have not been drinking as much alcohol as I was during Football season so I know that might be a factor.<br /><br />Bottom line is that I know anything could have caused the weight loss but the only thing that I have done drastically different is drink 1-2 cups of this tea per day. It tastes great (hot not cold or warm), gives me a healthy pep and focus, and I have not seen the scale consistently this low in a couple of years. Not to mention is comes nicely packaged. You can't go wrong here and I highly recommend it.
