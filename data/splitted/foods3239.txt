review/summary: We love this gum!
review/text: I try to give my kids things without artificial ingredients.  This gum is a huge hit in my house.  I do wish the flavor lasted longer, but the kids are used to natural gum and don't complain.  Its hard to find gum with natural ingredients and sugar free is a nice bonus.  We also enjoy the regular glee gum flavors that have sugar.

review/summary: Great flavor, well packaged
review/text: I love the smokey spice that this adds to dishes.  I've used it in soups, stews and relishes to add color and flavor.  It is not a terribly hot spice, but it has a very complex flavor somewhat similar to paprika.  The flakes are smaller and more evenly sized than crushed red pepper.  It came in a resealable, thick plastic bag.  It will last me a long time, but I will seriously consider ordering more from this company when I run out.

review/summary: A great sweetener
review/text: This sweetener is not for everything. I think it is specifically made to sprinkle over dry things like cereal. The Eryth. will not dissolve in cold liquids, nor will the fiber. So don't expect it to be like sugar in that regard.<br /><br />It does dissolve redily in hot liquids, but, again, the fiber doesn't. So it may not be to your liking in coffee or tea for that reason.<br /><br />I use it for a variety of applications, mostly for baking, but also to sweeten hot things that have something else in it that will mask the fiber (like baked apples for instance).<br /><br />I make a low-carb chocolate candy and the Sweet Fiber is actually the best choice for this because the fiber will slightly thicken the melted mixture.  If you're interested: mix up 2 tsp. cocoa and 4 tsp. Sweet Fiber. Stir in 4 T warm (liquid) coconut oil. Stir for a while to help dissolve the Eryth. and allow the fiber to thicken the mix (only slightly).  Pour about a half T of mixture (keep stirring it) into mini-muffin wells (about 8).  Add nuts or anything else you like.  Put in freezer to set. Remove 5 mins before eating to take the chill off the candy.

review/summary: Great Price for Product
review/text: I saw this item at a local store for quite a bit more.  I wanted to try it, but not at the price, so thought I would try Amazon since they have most everything...and at a better price.  The product I bought came in a pack of 3 shaker jars.  I have used one so far.  I am pleased with the product for mixing in dry ingredients for cooking or baking.  There is no aftertaste to any baked goods.  Even tho the product is sort of an extra fine granular it does not mix well in liquids such as when you pour it on cold or hot cereal.  That is the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5.  It is hard to stir fast enough to mix it into liquids such as coffee etc.  My husband says it does have a slight aftertaste in coffee.  I am happy with the use of it for baked goods tho and will purchase the item again.

review/summary: Fantastic alternative for veg(etari)ans, oniony flavor
review/text: Yes, it's on the salty side (most soups are), and yes, it's quite oniony.<br /><br />One thing I've always missed from my pre-veg days is chicken noodle soup. This soup overall isn't exactly like the real thing (no chicken broth taste, after all), but the fake chicken chunks are so realistic in taste and texture that the first time I tried it, I had to check the ingredients to make sure it wasn't actually chicken. The noodles are the texture I would expect, just like in a can of condensed chicken noodle soup. The broth is more oniony than I would prefer, but I assume it's made that way to make up for the lack of chicken broth... and I would rather have an oniony broth than one that was too watery or too spicy/herby.<br /><br />This soup immediately became one of my favorites. I mix crumbled Ritz crackers into it and, despite being a slow eater, I always end up scarfing it down in five minutes and wishing it wasn't gone already. So I'm really surprised that a few people here say it's so disgusting they had to spit it out. I'm not sure why that would be the case... unless they really hate onions, or they have a very low tolerance for vegetarian knockoff products.<br /><br />So basically I think this is a fantastic soup and I'm really grateful that there's a product that fills the void of the nostalgic Campbell's chicken noodle soup from my early days. But if you're not a vegetarian or you hate onions or you don't like salty stuff, you might want to buy a single can in a local health food store to try this out before you commit to a whole case of it.

I decided to go back to eating meat about 2 years ago, but a lot of chicken stuff still grosses me out.  When ever I am sick or craving some comfort food, I like to indulge in this product.  Other reviewers don't like the strong flavor of onions, but I sure do.  I like to sprinkle some red chile flakes on top for added kick.<br /><br />I caught a super bargain today, 12 cans for less than a buck each!  It's about 3 dollars a can at my grocery store.  It sure pays to scour Amazon for the deals of the day.

review/summary: Not quite Campbell's but is as close as I can find
review/text: Often when we are sick, we seem to revert to our childhood.  We didn't have many packaged/processed foods growing up but one thing we had was Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup when we were sick and didn't feel like eating anything else.<br /><br />I had a nasty sickness at the beginning of the year and for the first time in many, many years, I craved the overly salty, processed Campbell's Chicken Noodle soup.  A friend recommended Amy's No Chicken Noodle soup.<br /><br />The taste is a bit off but I found an easy fix for it.  Add a can of Amy's No Chicken Noodle soup, add a can of water and add a little of the Better than Bouillon Unchicken broth, heat and serve.  It is as close as a vegetarian is going to get to Campbell's I think.

review/text: This is healthy, meat free, organic and low fat, what more could you ask for? The faux-chicken tastes better than the real chicken in Campbell's (which is probably made of chicken beaks anyway). The flavor is just like any canned chicken soup but better. Some people are impossible to please, especially the ones that are newbs at being vegetarian because they're following a fad or trying to impress a guy/girl. Seriously, don't let the negative reviews sway you, the smell emitting from the can is the same as any canned soup, if not less noticeable and the taste is great (it's all natural so, unless they got an old can, how could there be a bad smell). Just knowing that there aren't a bunch of dead animal parts floating around in it is good enough for me. Oh, and it looks better than the pic on the label, way more noodles and carrots.

review/text: What a great concept! It had a nice flavor and had good salt/pepper in it. I liked the onion flavor too. What I didn't like were the noodles: they just didn't taste like noodles. They didn't have the little noodle 'bounce' to them; they were just flat and kind of soggy.<br />The soup was just too full of "stuff" swimming around in it. It would be nice if it were simpler, like the picture on the can is.<br />This is great for vegan or anyone veg; I've been trying to eat less meat. The tofu DOES mimic chicken all too well, but there was much too much of it. There was just too much of everything besides noodles.<br />I'd recommend Kroger or store brand "Noodle Soup" instead, but it's not vegan like this is. I love Amy's Kitchen, but I probably won't buy this soup again. Furthermore, it is quite expensive compared to its other canned soup counterparts (like the above soup I mentioned).

review/text: Amy, I served chicken noodle soup.  I knew chicken noodle soup.  Chicken noodle soup was a friend of mine.  Amy, you're no chicken noodle soup.<br /><br />If you haven't had meat in awhile, I suspect this would satisfy your chicken noodle soup craving.  But if you've had real, homemade chicken noodle soup (or heck, even something else from a can) in the past year, this soup is probably not for you.  The faux chicken's texture is not bad, but it tastes like onion-y cardboard.  The noodles are fine, but the overall taste is salty and onion-y, and not at all chicken-noodle-soup-y.<br /><br />If this soup dropped the faux chicken and called itself "onion noodle soup", I'd probably give it 2 stars.  However, as a "chicken noodle soup", it's just not very good (unless you love onions, salt and/or haven't had chicken in awhile).

The smell was absolutely horrible, reminded me of something that died weeks ago. I actually purchased this believing it was actual chicken noodle soup, until I get home and realize it is a fake chicken. I spent almost $7 on 2 cans of this stuff, too bad I can't get my money bad. This stuff is so bad that if God exist I wouldn't be surprised if the maker is eternally punished for the sin of making this atrocity. I'm just playing about the last sentence, just trying to get my point across about how much this stuff revolts me. This stuff is bad enough to scare you away from trying vegan dishes. I have tried other vegan dishes, and some were ok, but it goes a little far when this stuff is right next to real chicken noodle soup. I have not tried any of the companies other products, so I am not downing the company as a whole, but this needs a new recipe.

review/summary: Really Great Product
review/text: When searching for a dog food, I read many articles about the importance of not having corn or meat byproducts in a dog's food due to the sensitive nature of a dog's stomach. Some of these articles would come from dog food websites where the ingredient list would have corn as the first ingredient. We originally bought the Wellness brand Puppy food, but shortly after we got our dog, we realized that we were going to need food for a large breed puppy. Luckily, Wellness makes that food. It contains no corn and we have a happy, energetic puppy with a shiny coat and clear eyes. She never leaves a bite in her dish!

Within 12 hours of starting her on this food her stools firmed up and has been normal ever since, and she seems to be growing well on it also. The Vet said she was in perfect shape for her age, but we only feed about 3/4 of what the bag recommends. Like the Vet said they are selling dog food, and most brands recommend to much food on their bag.

I had never seen him gobble up dry food like that. As the day wore on I noticed an increased energy level in my puppy and he gladly had a second helping at night. I am already very happy and have high hopes for this food.

Whenever our pup starts to have digestive problems from a new snack, we back off and feed her only her Wellness chow, and the problem goes away in a day or so.<br /><br />We can even use this doggy food as a treat for training because she is extremely food-driven.  I also love that it is a dry food that is easy to carry around in my pocket as a treat, or on trips where we bring her a meal.  I highly recommend it to owners who care very much about feeding their pets quality food.

review/text: My puppy loves this and it was recommeded by my vet.  When the puppy was young, the Vet added a multi vitamen to her diet. After a couple of months of the Wellness Large Breed food the Vet said she did not need the multi vitamen any more.  The food is a bit expensive, but it seems to work very well for my dog.

review/text: I feed this to my two 6 month old golden retrievers.  I tried numerous other foods that they were just not interested in (eukanuba most recently). In addition to not liking the others - one dog was experiencing repeated ear infections at only 4 months. That is when I switched.  I mix the dry with 3 ounces of canned Wellness Puppy. They love it; ears are perfect, and no digestive issues at all.  highly recommend.

review/summary: Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed Puppy Food Better Than Science Diet Large Breed Puppy Food?
review/text: I have two golden retriever puppies, Darcy (6.5 months) and Eli (4 months). I have been feeding them Science Diet Large Breed Puppy Dog Food. The issue that I am continually having which has caused me to change their dog food to the Wellness SuperMixLarge Breed Puppy food is ... 1. Allergies (Darcy has continual eye tearing and needs Benedryl to stop ... IMO kind of ridiculous that a 6 mo old dog has to take allergen medication) -- Grain in the Science Diet likely the cause. 2. The amount of food needed to give the puppy is HIGHER for the same weight range and age. The second point leads to faster use of food, more fillers instead of nutrition in the food and larger amounts of waste. I have noticed a deterioration in waste from both puppies over time. They have diaherrea more frequently as each of them have got older.<br /><br />After totally switching foods yesterday, I have seen an improvement already in Darcy's tearing. I didn't use the Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed puppy food yet but another highly recommended dog food from samples at local pet stores. I just wanted to get them off Science Diet Large Breed Puppy food as I have heard through multiple sources that this food is terrible. Veternarians tend to recommend Science Diet because the company gives paybacks to veternarians from what I have heard though organizations and people around me.<br /><br />I will be trying the Wellness Super5Mix Large Breed Puppy food due to hearing from muliple sources that the Wellness dog food is a good choice especially the Wellness Core for adults.<br /><br />Two Week Update -- Darcy's eye issue from allergies has almost been resolved in two weeks of using this food. Also, Eli had developed stomach growling after every meal on Science Diet. This no longer occurs with him either. I am very happy with the Wellness Super5Mix Puppy food for Large Breeds. I would definitely recommend over Science Diet Puppy Food for Large Breeds. As far as waste, there is less and as I stated before I feed them less too. This food does not have the fillers like Science Diet does in their puppy food.

review/summary: Great for our GSD pups
review/text: After reading extensively about the horrors of normal dog food, my wife an I wanted a high quality food for our two German Shepherd pups.  We had a 5 year old mix that was getting chronic ear infections and always itching; changing her food to a good quality food (4 Heath in tractor supply) made a huge difference.  With our pups we didn't want to make any mistakes, and research took me to Wellness.  The calcium content is right for large breed pups and my dogs love it.  They look great and are developing well.  The ingredients listed are enough to know this food fits the bill.  Our pups took less than a week to switch over (at 7 weeks...breeder had them on Pedigree which is total crap) and had some runny stools at first, then they firmed up.  If you are reading htis and are on the fence, you should probably search some on what is in normal dog food...it will shock you.

review/summary: Worth the extra money
review/text: Considering that you can spend a bit less and get some mediocre puppy food, the extra money is worth knowing that I'm feeding my little guy quality food that will help him to grow up big and strong. =)<br /><br />It was important to me that I feed my pup quality ingredients, not animal-by-products and filler.  If I wouldn't want to eat chicken heads, why should he?  On most dog food you will find the first couple ingredients to be by-products, and even "animal-by-products"! You can't even be specific with which animal??  In addition to that there is a bunch of rice and filler.  Wellness has the good stuff - all natural and healthy ingredients that don't just fill your dog up, but provide nutritional content.

review/summary: Human grade
review/text: After losing our beloved dog last year to a host of allergic related diseases, we have settled upon the Wellness line of products. Wellness has been recommended by persons who have extensively researched their ingredients. To our horror, we discovered that most dog foods (including some that come highly recommended by veternarians) can contain ANYTHING due to the lack of inspection by any type of government agency. Euthanized animals and their parts, leashes, collars, microchips, etc. can be processed in their food. Since we have discovered this information, our dogs are healthier, happier, and disease free. It may cost a little more than some of the other brands but the peace of mind that comes with it, knowing we are not helping to kill our animals in the process of feeding them, makes the effort worth it.

review/text: I usually order Kahlua coffee through Keurig themselves.  This time I ordered the Timothy's brand through Amazon and the coffee I received was labeled MILD.  It certainly was......I could barely tell there was coffee in my coffee!  Are there different lengths of roasting the coffee beans resulting in different strengths?  The Keurig branded Kahlua coffee has always been stronger and that is what I prefer. Maybe it's my own error for not knowing any better but I won't order the Timothy's brand again.

review/summary: No soy lecithin, and DELICIOUS!
review/text: My husband is severely allergic to MSG, and soy lecithin is an ingredient that often contains small amounts of MSG because of how it is produced.  So, his options for chocolate are limited.<br /><br />For chocolate chip cookies, we used to chop up <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NY6Q0G">85% Lindt</a> bars (70% Lindt bars contain soy lecithin), to make our own "chocolate chips."  It wasn't very good, though, because chocolate chips don't taste as good when they're so dark.<br /><br />Then, one of my grocery stores started to carry these chocolate chips.  They are GREAT!  But, to me, since they're mini chips they tend to blend in, so you don't taste them as much when you eat the cookies.  We used to buy these a whole lot, and then we discovered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SEUA40">Enjoy Life Semi Sweet Chocolate Mega Chunks</a>, and now we've switched to buying those.  They are absolutely PERFECT for chocolate chip cookies.<br /><br />I was kind of skeptical--would these still taste as good as other chocolate chips?? My husband and I agree that they do!  To us, they taste just the same as regular chocolate chips.  My husband loves to snack on the chocolate chunks straight from the bag, so we go through a lot of those--about a bag every week.<br /><br />I recommend these (and the chunks) to anyone who can't have (or doesn't want to have) soy lecithin.  My husband definitely doesn't react to these chocolate chips--and he's had enough of them that we would know.  These chocolate chips and the chunks taste so normal that you could totally share treats with people who don't have allergies, and nobody would notice a difference.<br /><br />This is one of our favorite products.

About 1/2 of the jar.  It may be a bit short, but it works.)<br /><br />Put two eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat slightly.  Then add the oil and PB mix.

Bake 375 degrees for 12 mins.  They may not look done, but remove from oven and let set on cookie sheet to cool, then remove to plate or rack.  I get about 3 dozen palm-sized cookies.<br />NOTE: If you are using a stand mixer to mix this all up, you may need to add 1/4 C. of liquid, such as coconut or almond milk.)<br /><br />Adapted from Ruth's Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookies<br />By HokiesLady<br />[...]<br /><br />I find that the use of oil makes for a shortbread-like cookie.<br /><br />I hope you and your family find these as enjoyable and easy to make  as I do.<br />Please feel free to comment if you need more information.

review/summary: One of the better sugar-free chocolates out there...
review/text: This is definately one of my favorite sugar-free candies.  When a person stops eating chocolate with sugar in it; they forget what the 'real-stuff' tastes like.  After eating this enough times I've adapted to what this tastes like.  I've had much worse sugar-free chocolate candy and I've had better but that has sugar in it.  Eating this keeps me from feeling too deprieved.  Keeping in mind that these do have calories in them a person has to limit their intake to about 2 a day.  Eating more can give a person a stomach ache anyway.  I recommend these highly.  Most of Russell Stover sugar-free chocolates are very good products.

My dog loves it.  She also loves the duck flavor.  However it is more expensive.  My dog has been eating this canned food for over 6 months now and I am very pleased with the product.

review/summary: Works Very Well in My 7810 Senseo
review/text: I bought these after it became difficult to find Senseo pods (the K's seem to have pushed pods to the side). I wish I had bought these earlier because I find that my home ground beans (be sure to grind them very finely) are fresher and that I can pack more in than the commercial pods to make my coffee stronger. Of course you can pack less if weaker is what you're after. I use a tea stirring spoon to place 4 heaping spoonfuls in and use the back of the spoon to pack it, then I generally place a 5th spoonful and pack. The top takes a little effort to get on packed this full, but it works and I've never had a problem. I'm just finishing a cup of 8 O'Clock as I type this. Great product which I use daily (I try to keep 4-6 made up for each day). Good product, saved the life of my Senseo machine!

review/text: Keeping a few of these at hand in case one runs out of Senseo pods is ok. I used a middle range middle roast Mexican medium ground coffee and got ok results. If packed correctly one does get crema in the cup. Will be interested in results from finer grind and a premium roast. Definitely needs to be hand washed with dish detergent and then be sure to rinse and rinse and rinse to remove any detergent residue. Even in this dry climate takes, at least, 24 hours to dry thoroughly.

review/summary: When freshness is important
review/text: I like the idea of fresh products in my food.  I don't know that my pallet is sophisticated enough to really tell the difference, but I feel better about my cooking when I am using fresh products.  I am certain that it has to improve the overall quality of the cooking, so I am willing to pay more and take more time when it comes to this part of cooking.<br /><br />With that said, these whole nutmeg seeds add a great addition to cooking.  I put a little nutmeg in a lot of things.  Since I am adding it to fudge, cookies and all of my potato recipes, having fresh nutmeg is something I can always use.  I only gave this a 4 because it is a lot of nutmeg.  One seed can last quite awhile and I worry about the other seeds going stale -- although I am not even sure if that is a possibility.  I have enough that I might just plant a few just to see if they grow into anything.<br /><br />So, for the product itself, it is great.  The quantity is a bit Wholesale Club, so you might consider other options (like purchase this with a whole lot of friends and start a cooking with nutmeg club).

review/summary: Open Bottles in Huge Box
review/text: I ordered these ketchup bottles, some cereal, and some Pop-Tarts for my kids, even though there was already a 1 star review that said that the bottles were not sealed.  I thought that maybe it was a one-time issue.  A huge box arrived today with all 3 items in it, and the ketchup bottles had rattled around the box, smashing into everything else, and leaking all over the place.<br /><br />I tried to wash off the bottles, but then began to wonder which bottle it was that had leaked.  The answer?  There is no way to tell, as there were NO seals on ANY of the bottles.  They all arrived unsealed.<br /><br />If you don't mind about having bottles with no seal, and choose to order them anyway, my advice is to only order the ketchup, and wait a few days before ordering any other foodstuffs.  Otherwise, you, too, may find that the ketchup is all over, and that anything else you've bought has been hammered in its travels by the out of control ketchup.<br /><br />It also didn't help that, by packaging all these things together, the box was so heavy that my son had to help me into the house with it.

review/summary: Best vegan organic canned healthy chili... and there aren't many good ones...
review/text: I had this for lunch one day with some spicy potato chips. I only ate half the can and I was completely satisfied. Usually, I eat the whole can, but this was so hearty, I didn't even need to go back for seconds! Two cans of this and some corn bread could easily feed a family of four. I have a recipe for chili pie that I might use this for. This is easily my favorite canned chili, as the healthfulness more than makes up for the little extra you pay compared to the cheaper meat chilis.<br />My only gripe, and this was all but forgotten by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl, was the odd sweetness it had that isn't present in any other canned OR homemade chili I have ever had. It put me off when I was first heating it up, but I quickly adjusted to it and I swear, I wanted to lick the bowl when I was done. I just took it as the natural flavor chili acquires without meat and when it is subtly seasoned so as not to overpower the natural sweet acidity of the tomatoes and veggies. It kind of reminded me a tvp sloppy joe recipe I made in the crock pot, once. It wasn't QUITE that sweet, but the flavor was approaching that. Very tasy anyway, but if the idea of a slightly sweeter chili puts you off, definitely try this first before ordering a whole case. Otherwise, go nuts. You won't regret it. I wouldn't buy any other...

I love all of Amy's vegetarian products, and her chili is no exception. The medium chili is slightly spicy; we actually added some Sriracha sauce, tomato paste and sauce, and grated cheddar cheese on top, and put in some cut up Smart Dogs in it, and it was great!<br /><br />What I love about Amy's products is their committment to creating great tasting foods at reasonable prices. It's food you can feel good about eating. And, since we're trying to save money, this is a great way to eat something quick, easy, and inexpensive at home.<br /><br />And, with Amazon's great prices and delivery, you can easily have it on hand.

It  doesn't have that canned food taste and does not have a pop top.

review/summary: Flavorless
review/text: This is gross.  It's flavorless, with a weird texture of beans and gritty tofu (I think?).  I'm vegan, so trust me, I'm very forgiving on taste -- especially for something like chili.  I made it edible by pouring some BBQ sauce and spaghetti sauce in it, but I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: Delicious and Highly Nutritious!
review/text: At the moment, this is my favorite Amy's "canned" product.  It is delicious and highly nutritious!  "Medium" is the right word to describe the level of spiciness - just right.  This chili has no meat in it; instead, there's tofu, which tastes great and is good for you!<br /><br />With regards to nutritional information, here are some of the nutritional highlights/daily allowances (total values calculated based on 2 servings in 14.7 oz can):<br /><br />560 total calories<br />30 g of protein<br />0 mg of Cholesterol<br />1360 mg of Sodium<br />------------------------<br />30% Vitamin A<br />50% Vitamin C<br />12% Calcium<br />40% Iron

review/summary: Fantastic Vegan Chili
review/text: First thing I noticed when I put it in the cupboard next to the vegetarian chili from Trader Joe's the labels are very similar but that's where it stops. Amy's is right on the mark with their chili. Fantastic flavor, the medium has some kick but not unbearable which is exactly what I was looking for. With just the amount of my favorite...beans. I love it!

review/summary: Great product
review/text: This is a great canned chili.  It's a little pricier than standard canned chili, but I think it's worth it from a taste and quality standpoint.<br /><br />I like really spicy stuff, and I don't think it's very spicy.  If I were getting it for myself, I would definitely get the hot, but my wife doesn't like stuff as spicy.  The medium has flavor, but is definitely not that hot to my taste.

review/summary: Amy's Organic Medium Chili,
review/text: This is the first time I used this product and it was delicious!!  I was pleasantly surprised by just how close to home cooked Chili this product came.  Now I stretch it out by steaming Broccoli, Carrots or other fresh veggies and then combining them, adding a little sour cream and serving it all piping hot over either mashed potatoes or cooked rice  (like a gravy) or even Fettuccine.

review/text: Delicious straight from the can, garnished with fresh veggies or over a baked potato.  Nice counterpoint to whole grain bread and salad.  Filling but not fat laden.

review/summary: gluten free, vegetarian chili
review/text: I've been buying this chili locally for a couple years and decided it was time to buy a case. Tasty, filling and quick. Wonderfully seasoned, with the right amount of "hot and spicy". Great on a baked potato or made up as Chili Cheese Fries! YUM... This stuff would fool a carnivore.

review/summary: Vegetarian Chili is a Meatlover's Delight
review/text: If you're like me, you grew up eating meat.  I loved everything about it.  Steak, Hamburgers, BBQ, and most definitely, Chili.  Then I realized how meat is treated before it gets to me.  And that was that.  That first month of being a vegetarian was a nightmare.  I realized that our culture is nothing but meat.  It is the centerpiece of every single meal.  There was no escaping it.  And yet, I couldn't stand to touch it.  Not after I knew what I knew.  So I started trying the alternatives.  I went with the obvious stuff first, and, unless you were raised on grass, it tasted like crap.  Just when I was about to give up and spend the rest of my life eating baked potatoes, I found this chili.  It became a staple.  And then things started to turn around.  Slowly, and I do mean slowly, I started finding legitimate replacements for meat in my diet.  Not some vegetarian crap that I would never actually eat and would just sit in my freezer mocking me, but stuff I liked better than meat.  I started finding the good food on menus at restaurants.  Slowly, a whole new world opened up to me.  Now, I eat whenever I want and as much as I want.  I eat better than any of my friends who spend their time at fast food joints trying to figure out what they want to eat.  Not knowing that that food will always leave them unsatisfied.  Because it isn't food.  What's really weird is I made a rule that since I was giving up meat in response to the horrific treatment of animals,I could eat as much as I wanted of anything else. (I don't mind killing animals for food.  I would eat people if they were fixed right!  But the problem is how they are treated before they are killed.  And the fact that most of them are so disease ridden that they have to be pumped full of antibiotics to keep them alive long enough to drag them to the brutal factory floors before they die from one kind of disease or another.)  But here's what ended up happening. My meals satisfied me more and I actually ended up eating less.  And through no other changes than giving up meat and walking three times a week (which I was already doing and not losing a fricking pound) I have to date lost 40 pounds.  If that isn't a ringing endorsement of giving up meat, well, then there is no convincing you.  So thank you Amy's Chili.  You started it all for me.  Now I feel better and eat better and feel that I am an all around better person.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />If you have to have meat, but wish there was something you could actually enjoy in it's place, this is for you.  Just buy one can.  You can thank me later.
