review/text: This product is very good, but what with the $79.00 price plus paying for shipping.  I was ordering this product for $30.00 for a pack of 12 boxes and shipping was free  I was told a few months ago the cookies would no longer be made.<br />I get an e-mail that they are in stock again, well that's nice but not at the $79.00 price I can get them a lot less expensive at my local grocery store.

review/text: We need sugar free desserts, but this price is way ridiculous unless it is a typo. Comes out to $1 per ounce of cookies; Amazon should be aware they're charging more than 3 times the price to be had at a grocery store, on top of paying shipment.  No go.

review/summary: Great taste, but....
review/text: I ended up tossing my entire case of cookies in the trash.  I've low-carb dieted for many years so I'm well acquainted with the "effects" of sugar substitutes, but what these little cookies do to your intestinal track just aint right. Even 1 cookie sent me over the edge.<br /><br />I gave some to two co-workers and they had the same reaction.  Probably the best tasting sugar-free cookie I've ever samples, but be forewarned, you might pay for it in more ways than one.

review/summary: New to S/F
review/text: I am new to sugar-free eating so I have had a string of disappointment while trying to find some decent s/f treats.  I have looked everywhere and I cannot seem to find these cookies in the Midwest, however, I found them while visiting in Alabama.  I bought three boxes, taking the chance that I may not like them.  I am so glad that I did.  They are 50 calories per cookie, so they are not a low calorie treat, but they are just as delicious as the original.  I read another reviewer who had some inconvenient intestinal tract reactions.  These cookies did not affect me in this way at all.  I gave them a 5-star b/c in my opinion this is a superb product.  I will be sad to run out of my boxes, but they are on my Amazon Wish List!

Im not going to pay anywhere near $35 for a case of 12 when I can buy them at my grocery store for a $1.25 each! That make this DOUBLE the price. Not a chance. Lower your price to a realistic point and maybe Ill purchase from you.<br /><br />  ***UPDATE***<br />  LOcal price is about $2 on average now so these are quite as overpriced anymore but not still not enough of a deal to buy here if you can find locally.

review/summary: revel berry is my least favorite, but still great!
review/text: I'm not going to tell you what yerba mate is and all that. I just want to tell you that this stuff is amazing. The cans, the bottles, the tea bags: they're all great.<br />I can (and have) chug an entire can of guayaki yerba mate and feel amazing. it gives me a tingly sensation throughout my body, makes me mentally aware of everything (try drinking it in a nice shady park or something), and never ever makes me crash like coffee or energy drinks do.<br />The price might be a little high, but I feel it is worth it. It also depends where you buy it. I've seen the cans go for as high as $2.50, but i have found a place that sells them for only $2 a can! i'm not going to tell you where though! it's all mine! all mine!<br />the cans and bottles are my favorite. they have great flavors.<br />for the cans, the flavors, from greatest to least greatest:<br />lemon elation<br />enlighten mint<br />revel berry (don't really care for this one too much, but if the other two are out, it's still good)<br />for the bottles, i can't name all the flavors since there are quite a few, i would recommend the cardio one, i believe it is raspberry flavor and red. other ones i would suggest are the pomegranate one and the mint one. the pomegranate is extreme! makes me feel super duper! whoooo! and if you look closely at the bottle, you can see sediment at the bottom. give that bottle a shake, pop it open, and enjoy. you don't even have to chug this stuff to feel the energy, just sip on it, and i promise you each sip will make you feel better and better.<br />there is no hfcs or anything artificial. it is completely organic and has very little sugar.<br />if i were you, i would stop paying an arm and a leg buying coffee at starbucks and use that money to buy guayaki yerba mate. just try it once. but make sure you actually get the flavored ones. if you try the pure yerba mate flavor, you probably won't like it.<br />oh yeah, and for each product you buy, a portion of your money is donated to helping south american rainforests. so not only are you drinking healthily, you're also helping the planet out.<br />AND one more thing, this stuff is great if you're on a diet. look more into this, because i don't want to get into that.<br />but yeah, my most favorite drink.<br />TRY IT OUT!

I never liked the taste of sweet tea or raspberry tea, but this really taste good. Gives me the same amount of energy as a big cup of coffee, minus the heartburn. As for the price, at 24$ a case its the same price as my local grocery store.

review/text: The first box I ever bought was good. The tea, to me, tasted better cold than hot so I would make an ice tea of it and refrigerate it until I wanted it. The last few boxes I bought, however, were awful. I would boil the water and steep it and the tea would make this oily film over the top. It would just float and wasn't tasty to drink. I know sometimes plants have oils in them but this was excessive and killed the flavor. Not buying this brand again.

review/text: I have been having problems with my bladder. Interstital Cystitis is a chronic condition and also effects the colon. I suffer from severe constipation (IBS) also.  I take fiber during the day and make sure I get enough in my diet. In the morning I drink a cup of Alvita Senna tea and within 1 to 1/2 hrs. I have elimination. This is the only thing that has worked for me. I have tried many other laxatives which do not work and bother my bladder. This product does not. I have also drank it at night with good results in the morning. Doctors have said not to use this continually because you could develop dependence. However, my condition is unbearable without it. At last my doctor agreeded that if I was going to take something daily then he suggested this tea.  I highly recommend it for people with my condition or for individuals who take a lot of medications that tend to slow down the system. I have placed an order for more and will continue to use this great product. By the way, I had purchased another brand before I bought this brand and it was of terrible quality. What a difference. This product has great quality and also I like the tea bags being natural and not bleached with chemicals.

One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.  Obviously I can't prove that this was BECAUSE of the tea, but I am convinced that I wasted my money on this useless product, and that, at least for me, it provided absolutely no results for anything.  Sorry.

review/text: i really have to say I love this chamomile tea. Especially when I have a cough and/or cold I brew some and pour it in a bowl to inhale the chamomile vapors. It works just great. Of course I also love to drink it when I'm sick. I like the chamomile taste and that there are not other ingredients in it but the chamomile.

review/text: I ordered this for my boyfriend because he has trouble sleeping sometimes. He loves it! It makes him a little bit loopy before he goes to sleep but he likes the feeling. The only thing I don't like is that on the shelf it smells like vomit. It grosses me out. It doesn't smell like that when it's brewed.

review/summary: Awesome Tea
review/text: I drank this tea at least 4 days a week during the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy.  I wish I did it the entire last trimester and everyday!  I had a 6 hour natural labor and delivery and I only pushed for 15 minutes.  My contractions, even at their most intense, only felt like strong menstrual cramps.  I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.  My last trimester was in the summer though, so I always drank it iced.  I also used Evening Primrose Oil suppositories for the last 5 weeks. I really believe that these two factors are the main reason why my labor and delivery was so fast and EASY!

Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost "manure" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said "Oh, that's not bad!" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!

This tea should be taken carefully. It is used as an immune system booster. I think drinking it four times a week is good enough.<br /><br />I really enjoy the warming up effect it has.

review/summary: tea OK, postage way too high
review/text: The sage tea is OK, but I was surprised that for 2 boxes from the same sender was I charged double the postage -- the tea weighs next to nothing.  Why not charge for the actual weight instead of a set price for each item?

review/summary: tasty Maybe beneficial
review/text: My midwife recommended this product, and I drank it throughout my second and third trimesters. My labor was slow, but I experienced nothing you might really call pain (pressure and some discomfort) all the way to 9 centimeters. Then I pushed 3 times and my son was born. I'm not saying for sure that it was the tea...but I didn't have labors like this with my other two.<br />At any rate, it's tasty and not harmful. Just remember to tell your midwife or doctor that you're using it. I still drink it just cause I like it.

review/summary: Menopause Relief
review/text: I wanted a natural product to help with hot flashes and night sweats. This makes an INCREDIBLE difference in my quality of life and sleep.  I had significant decrease in symptoms almost immediately.  I let it steep in my cup for about 5 minutes.  I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.

review/summary: Mild sweet tea
review/text: I've been watching the new Dr. Oz show and he recently recommended nettle tea. So I bought some and this happened to be the brand I chose.<br /><br />Nettle leaf tea is mild and sweet (I augment by using honey). Not absolutely sure of its benefits. It's touted as good for being a diuretic thereby keeping your kidneys clear and keeping bladder infections and kidney stones at bay. It's also suppose to help with arthritis. Dr. Oz had commented that it's suppose to help with head hair growth.<br /><br />I recommend it if for no other reason in that it's pleasant for those who like a less bitter type of tea.<br /><br />Alvita uses minimal packaging. The tea is in simple bags without strings or tags and smelled very fresh upon opening.

review/summary: A must have if you have painful heavy periods
review/text: I had very painful cramps with Very Heavy bleeding that lasted for 5 days! and this cycle repeated every 21 days! So I would have a full period twice a month!! I was miserable and had to schedule my life around my cycle, because I was doubled over in pain or afraid of the embarrasment of bleeding onto my clothes! A friend recomended drinking this tea and my life changed!! I no longer have ANY Cramps!! the bleeding has subsided to 3 days with a normal flow and now my cycle is regulated to every 26 days or once a month. I have more energy and vitality and dont have to call in sick anymore!! This tea is blessing not only for pregnancy but for your menstrual cycle as well!! I tell every woman I know about this tea!! No need for birth control pills or other hormonal intervention. I love its pleasant light taste and enjoy drinking a cup a day.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: this red clover tea is worth my money, i have shed 8 pounds in 3 weeks, i know its not a diet tea or anything but, i drink this twice a day eat my 3 regular small meals, and a fruit or a rice cake or something lowfat, the tea coupled with better<br />eating habits and i ride my exercise bike and do a few stretches, lunges, lift a 5 pound weight in sets of 5's twice, for<br />about 15 minutes total2 times a day, nothing long and drawn out. before 3 weeks ago i honestly weighed 199, that's a lot of weight if you are 5'2, mostly in my butt and thighs. today i weigh 190, today meaning march 20, 2012. i have a long way to<br />go but that is a good start for me i love food it is hard but i find lowfat and sugarfree things to snack on. being overweight makes you tired easily, and the more tired you feel the more you will just sit around and when you sit around,<br />yep you tend to snack. my goal is 170 pounds, yea that is still a lot of weight but i am a realistic person, i will not<br />set myself up for a let down. if a should lose anything beyond 170 i will be very happy, i will update my quest on april 20, 2012. thanks

review/summary: Anecdotal evidence was too true for me!
review/text: I drank 3 cups brewed with 2 tea bags each of this tea for the last few months of my pregnancy.  The amount of time I spent pushing my son out totaled 5 minutes.  My midwife had said there were lots of anecdotal reports of raspberry leaf tea causing easier labors but I was skeptical.  Obviously, my experience made me a believer!<br /><br />I found this tea's taste to be no different from the more expensive brands.  And I appreciate that the design of these teabags is less wasteful by not using strings, tags, or staples like most teas.

review/text: I started drinking this tea after a Doctor of alternative medicine recommended it to cure a Yeast Infection. It worked! I did not had to do to a GYN to cure my yeast infection. Also, it helped me in other way. After I started drinking the tea I stopped craving sugar. Needless to say, I lost like 15 pounds while drinking it. Is amazing and very medicinal. It also helps me with menstrual cramps. I love it! You can find it here online or in any natural health food store near you.

review/summary: IT WORKS  FOR ME
review/text: I use it to help jump start my weight loss regime. I sometimes flip flop up and down 8 pounds when I am not careful and i drink this tea for about 3 days and I shed it all. It is NOT a gentle cleanser though it will have your stomach turning and yearning but in 8-12 hours it does the cleansing job and it usually only does it for the first go round.<br />I would say go for it, if you need to get a jump start but DONT expect a good tasting tea very bitter. I DONT sweeten at all, I break the bags so i can swallow some of the bark in the tea as well. Good Luck
