I miss the original bottles with the bas relief cowboy on his horse, but I can live without that as long as I get that original taste.

review/summary: If this is what being a cowboy is like, get me a time machine!
review/text: Normally, I like to try out any soft drink I see for sale, and back in 2005 or so, I laid my eyes on this beauty.  The bottle design by itself had me intrigued because of its old-fashioned nature, and when I took my first sip, my tastebuds almost exploded with excitement for such a delicious drink.  I've never had a root beer-like beverage quite like Sioux City Sarsaparilla, and it's definitely up there as a favorite drink.  The clear disadvantage to it is its pricing, but if you're wanting to treat your palate to a sweet drink with character, then look no farther than Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

Since we don't have to pack and ship them ourselves, we actually end up saving a little time and money.

review/text: The product description says: "Keta Salmon Caviar is from the select roe of the Keta Salmon, which has very large eggs with a color that can range from bright red to brilliant orange."<br /><br />The caviar I received consisted of really small eggs (about half the size of those at a sushi restaurant) that are mushy, and taste awful. Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them. I had a "taste test" with my cat and dog, who *love* caviar) and they both turned their noses up at it. NOT a good sign.  :-(

review/summary: Pernigotti cocoa in these -- first-rate!
review/text: As Marco G. says, these Pernigotti brand Gianduiotti candies are first-rate, and Niche Imports cares enough about their products to add the cooler packs.  (You pay for that quality and the service, of course, but I think it's worth it.)  I disagree with Marco insofar as these are no more "real" than several other brands, except that Pernigotti *may* have been one of the first producers with the classic shape and composition of these smooth hazelnut chocolates.  In fact, if you go to a Lindt store, you can even find Swiss-made Gianduiotti!  Those aren't bad, but have more sugar, and taste, well, kind of like Lindt milk chocolate!  These Pernigotti use some combination of beans like in Pernigotti cocoa powder, and as a result have a richer taste.  Still plenty sweet, but less cloying than most.  (And no granules of hazelnut, as seems to be popular with some manufacturers nowadays.)  If you wanted to see what the fuss was about without actually paying shipping for a single bag, or to "risk" ordering enough quantity to amortize the shipping cost, you might try going to a Williams-Sonoma store and buying a tin of Pernigotti cocoa, and make hot chocolate with it.  Either you'll love it or hate it, and then you'll know whether or not these Gianduiotti are for you.  I feel the cocoa is way more complex than other brands, and that these candies are downright addictive -- they spoiled me against other brands, as Marco says.  I have only one minor complaint: Niche Imports takes whatever size bags and boxes the factory gives them, and never updates their listings.  So for example this product picture is a 200 gram bag, but the listing says 300 grams!  Are you being cheated?  Well, not exactly, but if you're the sort of person who gets bent out of shape about this kind of thing, e-mail them before you order.  Highest possible recommendation for this product!

review/summary: very good, but NOT Dilettante's "Ephemere Truffle Sauce"
review/text: The picture is correct; the title is not -- this isn't "Ephemere Truffle Sauce".  This is Dilettante's "Chocolate Sauce", which tastes different than their original "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LJUVM">Chocolate Truffle Topping</a>", available in 10-oz. jars.  (Apparently "Ephemere" is now branding rather than referring to a specific product as it once did.)  The small jars are less pourable, more like a solid until heated, and seem to have more of that "volatile aromatics" kind of smell.  This chocolate sauce smells and tastes more like a "hot fudge sauce", i.e. a more-cooked flavor than the truffle sauce.  (No, this isn't like that awful supermarket "fudge" sauce; this has 65% cocoa!  Don't even read the supermarket ingredients list or you'll choke...)  So: If you're making coffee mocha drinks -- or make hot chocolate restaurant-style by using fudge sauce plus microwaved milk, rather than stirring cocoa powder forever on the stovetop -- then this is your stuff.  However, if you want the ultimate ice cream topping, buy the small jars instead.  Having now tasted both, I prefer to go to the trouble of making my own!  The recipe from Cook's Illustrated July/August 1997, page 21 requires two types of chocolate: solid plus cocoa powder.  I use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002RBTX4O">Lindt Bittersweet</a> bars (also available in smaller sizes at supermarkets or a local Lindt store if you're so lucky), with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q0IMOK">Pernigotti Cocoa</a> (also available in smaller quantities at Williams-Sonoma).  Alas, these ingredients cost the same or more, plus it takes your own labor!  But the complexity of flavor -- deeper than either Dilettante product -- is worth it.

review/text: Just tried this sauce tonight with a good al dente pasta and a mid-priced cab.  Verdict:  HOLY NUTS!!  I love it.  This sauce turns pasta from that cheap college meal into a formal entree.  It tastes like freshly stewed tomatoes with a touch of herbs, a subtle garlic flavor, and rather low acidity.  Most other sauces, even in the $4-$5 range, have a high acidity and a "pur&eacute;ed" taste.  I got this sauce for $6 or $7 a Whole Foods (still high but not as high as it priced on Amazon).  It's high priced for even me but I don't think I can go back to another sauce.  It's that good.

I really enjoy the bittersweet taste of pomegranate and bought a box of the POMEGRANATE FRUIT MARVELS. The 5oz box contains about 30 pieces of candy.  Fruit Marvels come in little round spheres that have a semi-hard confectionary shell lightly coated in sugar.  The shell isn't very hard and is easy to chew through. Inside the shell is a soft and juicy core.  The POMEGRANATE FRUIT MARVELS are an interesting flavor of tart sweetness. I really enjoyed the candy and look forward to treating myself by buying another box.

review/summary: One of the better T-Discs
review/text: I have tried about 75% of the available T-Discs, and the Kona Blend is one of the best regular/unflavored coffees for Tassimo. It has a nice smooth flavor that is not overpowering, and has a pleasant aroma. Personally, I would enjoy it more if it were stronger/bolder. However, being a bit mild, it goes well with breakfast and/or (gluten-free) baked goodies. I find it mildly perplexing that this product is not available from tassimodirect, nor is a subscription service available. Originally found this at (Dead Bats from) Beyond, used a 20% coupon, and was happy with the final price.

review/summary: Note: Rating both coffee and seller
review/text: This coffee is good but, for me, it's nothing special. I will buy it again because it's a nice, mellow blend, and my favorite daily coffee, Nabob, must now be shipped from Canada. However, on my first order to the Canadian company, it's taking a long time to be delivered (still haven't gotten it).<br /><br />The reason for only three stars is not about the quality of the coffee but the fact that the description of the product does not mention the fact that this "Kona coffee" is actually only 15% Kona. If you look very carefully at the photo of the disc, you can see that information, and there's a legal disclaimer saying that the product may not match exactly with the description. So it's my fault for not reading more carefully, but I was happy to see what I thought was 100% Kona and wasn't careful. I've bought the 15% Kona before in a local store and did know that there was such a product in the Tassimo discs, but I just read the product title and ordered.<br /><br />As I said, the coffee tastes good, the amount of coffee is the usual amount, neither the small cups of some European coffees or the extra large size, and I would recommend the coffee. Just be aware that this is blended coffee with only 15% Kona. And don't expect it to come in a flash, as it did when Amazon Prime delivered it.

review/summary: Fairly yummy, some concern over ingredients
review/text: Simply based on taste, I give this "Sweet Tea" flavored water-enhancer a pretty good rating. It's certainly a lot better than Crystal Light or some of those other powders. I'm health conscious and drink pretty much nothing but water and the occasional carrot juice. After a while, I do admit, water can start to taste bland. I would occasionally like to drink something sweet without having to worry about all the sugar. Enter this MIO stuff, which seemed like it could fit the bill: in theory.<br /><br />I'm not a nutritionist, so I don't know how actually healthy this stuff is. My guess is that it's not healthy at all. Generally speaking, anything that tastes this sweet is not good for you. Here are the ingredients: Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium(Sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Polysorbate 60, Blue 1, Yellow 5, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (Preservative).<br /><br />So yeah, a bunch of stuff I've never heard of plus some icky dyes. Personally, I'd just rather drink up a nice cool glass of purified water. It feels clean and tastes good. But, if for some reason you simply MUST drink something sweet, these little juice-it-ups might help out.  Overall, I'd never spend a dime on them. And I DEFINITELY wouldn't spend $6 for a little bottle. But, because it was tasty, I do give it a solid average rating.

review/summary: Similar to Crystal Light, but with flexible portions
review/text: If you like Crystal Light Tea, you'll like MIO Tea.  The biggest difference is in portions.  The Crystal packets are one-size-fits-all, made for a 1/2 liter water bottle.  If your bottle is 20 ounces, you'll get a weaker tea.  If you have an 8 or 12 ounce glass, good luck estimating half or 3/4 of a packet to match your water volume.<br /><br />The MIO container, on the other hand, is good for any size portion, though it may take some practice to master it.  One average squeeze of the teardrop is good for 8 ounces, two for a half-liter, and so on.  Each person's squeeze is variable, so you'll need to get the hang of how much works for you, and for how strong you like your tea.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's hard to tell when the teardrop container is on it's last squeeze.  I ended up with a bottle with 20 ounces of water and enough tea concentrate for about 12 - very weak tea, indeed, and a waste.<br /><br />I tried the Mio Peach Tea first, and the Sweet Tea is a MUCH STRONGER tea flavor.  Where the peach flavor is a light color and light taste, this Sweet Tea is a strong flavor and darker color.  But it is not a very sweet southern-style sweet tea, in my opinion.  The tea flavor is stronger, but it isn't all that sweet.

review/text: I've been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG">MIO</a> in my water for quite a while now. I like that it allows me to give my water that something extra, so that it makes me more inclined to get my daily intake of water in. Additionally being able to choose how much or how little flavor you add is nice too; me I found that with most of the flavors I like 2-3 quick squirts in my water bottle which holds 24 ounces. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG">MIO Mango Peach</a> is by far my favorite, with Sweet Tea as a close second. For some the taste may be unappetizing and I admit at first I wasn't sure I liked it, but it grew on me and now I use MIO on an almost daily basis.

review/text: MIO Sweet Tea is an interesting little gimmick that turns a glass of water into a drink that tastes something like sweet tea.<br />Mostly, it tastes like the bottled or canned tea you'd find in a gas station or convenience store, but definitely not as tasty as fresh-brewed Southern style sweet tea. I didn't like it enough to drink a whole glass of it. I made some for my wife and she wasn't impressed, either, and she's more of a sweet tea drinker than I.<br />I think I'd rather drink a glass of cold water than a glass treated with this stuff.

review/text: So, the concept of this is actually pretty good in my opinion. You have this little bottle, and you add as much of the flavor as you want to a glass of water to meet your tastes.<br /><br />With this flavor "Sweet Tea" I think you have to really really like sweet tea in order to appreciate this. I like sweet tea, but even at the lowest dose suggestion I could never get a taste that really suited me. I tried a couple other times with less (than recommended) and still was not able to get it to my liking.<br /><br />I can appreciate that this will be a product that some will absolutely love. But, I also think it is one that some people (like me) just don't like. I would be curious to try other flavors though. Maybe one of them is more to my liking.

review/text: I am overall impressed with the taste of this product.  I try to drink my share of water during the day; and this product helps add variety.  For myself, I have found I'm using about a teaspoon for every bottle of water.  (16.9 oz). This gives me just enough sweetness for my taste.  If i add more than that, in my experience there is a funny aftertaste.  But that's one of the perks...you can add as much or as little as you want.  I also find the container convenient to take to work, etc.  Lastly, I feel that it is a great flavor, but nothing beats real tea.  I gave it a four because I can buy it cheaper in the store...but still a great product.

review/text: I have enjoyed this MIO Sweet Tea. It is easier to add to your water than the individual powdered drinks that always seem to end up with powder everywhere. Squirting the concentrated flavor takes a little practice - my first glass was WAY too strong, but it has a good sweet tea flavor. This would be great to drop in your purse - the plastic snap lid won't leak. I like the idea behind this and would be interested in trying other flavors to see if they are as good as the sweet tea one!

review/summary: More Bitter than Sweet
review/text: Please note this review only covers the MIO Sweet Tea flavor.<br /><br />Flavor - An approximation of "Sweet Tea," but not close to the real thing.  (If you give McDonald's version a 10, this ranks about a 1 in similarity and quality.)  It has a very distinct chemical flavor that lets you know that you're drinking something artificial but if you're used to diet drinks and try not to think of it as sweet tea but something "in the tea family" it'll get you by.<br /><br />Convenience - Very convenient and useful assuming you find a flavor you enjoy.  (Keep a bottle with you and you can make your own drinks at restaurants and save yourself a lot of money.)<br /><br />Value - Assuming the price remains at $19.99 for 4 bottles that each make 24 servings you're paying about 21 cents for each 8 ounce glass which is reasonable.  Even considering you'll most likely only get about 12-15 servings depending on how sweet you make each one and how large your glass is, a cost of about 33-42 cents a glass is comparable to a can of soda from the grocery store.  (Much cheaper than something from a vending machine or convenience store.)<br /><br />Overall I would recommend they change the name of this flavor to something less misleading like "Brownish Tea Flavored Substance." It would be more honest, although, admittedly, not as marketable.

It's much handier than the little powder packets and you can add as much flavor as you want. Not to mention, you don't have the powder flying up in your face when you pour it. It's easy to control. It won't leak out when you tip the bottle. You have to squeeze for any liquid to come out. I heard that fruit punch is the best flavor and may try it sometime. I like Mio because flavoring my water gets me to drink more water and Mio contains 0 calories.

review/text: I've had instant and canned teas in the past and was less than impressed with those products, so I was hoping for something better with the MiO Sweet Tea.  At first I got the mixture wrong-- I put 1 tsp into 8 ounces of water.  There was too much of a citrus-like after taste, and of course the flavor in general was too strong.  Once I got the mixture right (use 1/2 tsp for every 8oz), my opinion changed.  The flavor is great, and I love it!  The 24 servings of this product were gone in no time, as I made 16 ounce servings frequently.  I imagine the liquid would easily stain clothing, so be careful as you squirt it out, but otherwise I have no reservations in recommending this.

review/summary: Mio Tea-O
review/text: I've been curious about these MiO Liquid "Water Enhancers" so I tried the Mango Peach flavor it was good so now I've tried Sweet Tea. It comes in a cool little bottle with a flip lid and non drip type nozzle. So, if you were so inclined, you could easily carry one around in your pocket.<br /><br />About two quick squirts into a bottle or cup of water (I prefer a bottle so I can shake it) is enough to flavor your water. And it is a decent flavor. Not too sweet but surprisingly it does taste a lot like real sweet tea.  My wife tried it too and was surprised at the tea flavor.<br /><br />One item of note is that these are not health products. They do not have vitamins. They only flavor water. I just wanted to mention that because I was not sure myself before I tried one.<br /><br />So it's a cool little product and if you drink a lot of water and want some flavor in it you could do worse. And it is portable and lasts a pretty long while. I think this particular one is probably my favorite flavor.

review/summary: Better than the powder mixes
review/text: I have been using the powder mixes you can add to water bottles for a while, but I have to say I like the MIO liquids better. The best thing is that you can control how much flavor you want by how much you squirt in. With some powdered mixes, I have had to add two or three packages to get the flavor I wanted. With MIO, you just add a drop or squirt more.<br /><br />As to the flavor, I love Sweet Tea more than any other tea, an MIO is the best I have tasted. Far to many forget about the "Sweet" part of the Tea. This Sweet tea is sweet enough for me and as above, I can control how strong I want the tea flavor.<br /><br />MIO also has lots of other flavors to choose from, but I do hope they have a lemonade in the works.

review/text: MIO Sweet Tea tastes somewhat like sweet tea once you put about 3 healthy squirts into a regular size water bottle.  With the amount of squirts necessary to produce the sweet tea flavor (tastes like tea, but not overly sweet), I doubt that the MIO bottle will actually have enough liquid to flavor 24 water bottles.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, the MIO sweet tea flavoring tastes somewhat like sweet tea.  The flavor resembles instant tea more than brewed tea.<br /><br />So, overall, the MIO sweet tea flavor is OK.  It is a nice change from the berry or fruit flavor choices, but isn't quite on par with the real thing.

review/text: I also recently tried the peach variety of this Mio water enhancer. As with that one, I felt I had to do two squeezes here to really get some flavor. And you do have to stir -- the liquid is not going to automatically dissipate in the water. Not bad things, just observations. But hey, it's a tiny little package that will flavor up to 24 glasses of water, so that's convenient.<br /><br />As far as the taste, it's definitely sweet tea coming through. I never knew what sweet tea was before moving to the South, having been a huge fan of straight (unsweetened) hot tea all my life. But this flavor is fine and reminds me a bit of the instant tea mixes like Nestea. At two squeezes, it's lightly sweet, not overly sweet.

But this has barely any flavor and at best would be good for tea drinkers who like weak, unsweetened tea.<br /><br />I did give three stars because the packaging is soooo cool. It looks cool, makes you want to buy it, it's just a fun container. Also, the idea of having a wee squirt bottle you can carry in your purse or backpack or briefcase and add flavor to a bottle of water...love it! It's like a flask for the on-the-go crowd of the new millennium! It's just such a neat idea! I do think whatever flavors they offer though, need to be a lot stronger so you don't have to add so much to get a good balance.<br /><br />I'd say this is a great idea. I can see lots of flavors like cotton candy, (various snow cone type flavors), coffee, latte, maybe even something like broth that you could add to hot water? Cocoa! I can even see fun candy flavors, like M&M, Reeses, etc and you could mix them together in the bottle. A good future is possible, just give us more intense flavor!!

review/text: It is very easy to make a nice cup of caffeine-free drink with this product. Just add few drops into a cup of water and it tastes great. The flavor is good, but I would have preferred a little more sweet stuff in the product. You can adjust the amount of stock depending on the size of the cup. It is convenient to carry to the office. You can also use small portions, if you don't want to make a whole pitcher of tea; recommended!<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010ED368">Flora Flor-essence Liquid Tea Blend 17-Ounces Glass Bottle</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005URKAZ8">Lemon Masala Chai - Organic Loose Leaf Tea - 5 Ounce Bag (Approx. 40 - 48 Cups)</a>

review/summary: Chemical aftertaste.
review/text: Let me start off by saying that I normally don't use artificial sweeteners, except for the occasional packet of stevia added to a fruit smoothie. If I have iced tea, I drink it unsweetened. I just couldn't handle the chemical aftertaste of MIO Sweet Tea.  My husband and kids drink a lot of sweet tea that we brew at home, so I wanted them to give this sugar free version a try.  They didn't care for it either.  My youngest son, however, does like the Berry Pomegranate flavor.  Maybe someone who is already accustomed to using artificial sweeteners would like this.

review/summary: Tastes good & convenient - but hard to judge amount
review/text: I liked the idea of adding how much flavoring to water that I want. I typically use crystal light preloaded packets, but they can be too sweet. The MIO is a ice idea because you can see how much you are adding, however the bad thing is if you are NOT using a clear bottle you have to add a little, taste add some more taste.. etc.. And then if you add TOO much, then you have to add water etc..<br />On the whole the sweet tea tastes pretty good, but if you overdo it it tastes too sweet.. so just add a little at a time!<br /><br />If they re-do the bottle so that it pops say a half an ounce out per squeeze it would be a lot better!<br /><br />On the flavoring - you an control how sweet it is ****<br />One the value - you can really get a lot of bottles of water out of these more if you don't like VERY sweet water ****<br />No calories! ****<br /><br />Cons:<br />However if you are not careful you can't control how much you put in (If not in a clear bottle) **<br />Does taste a little "fake" and a little aftertaste if you do make it very sweet. **<br /><br />Overall I like the idea, and now that I know how much I like in a 16 oz bottle - 2 small squirts (or a light tan! color) I like the flavor.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Jim

review/summary: Great taste no calories
review/text: When I first saw a commercial for this product I was a bit skeptical whether or not it would live up to expectations.  Personally I found that the product lived up to, and maybe surpassed some of my expectations.  If you are like me, constantly looking for ways to spice up your drink without the extra sugar and calories, this is a great product for you.  Mio allows you to add as much extra flavor as you want, you can add a drop, or pour the entire bottle into your drink, the result is a sugar free drink that is specifically designed by you.<br /><br />I personally really enjoyed this product because it has no calories, and no sugar in it.  Drinking 8 glasses of water a day is a struggle, but this is one way to get your water intake and enjoy a flavored drink without any extra calories.  If you are looking to cut back on your sugary drink intake, this is a great product to pick up, because it will allow you to enjoy a flavored drink without the sugar.

review/text: This is a neat product.  I really like that it is liquid instead of powder and a very nice "purse size".  I am a sweet tea drinker from the south....so I like my sweet tea brewed the old fashioned way best of all, but this would be great in certain instances.  It has a very nice taste close to sweet tea. I really like that it is caffeine free.  My son and daughter-in-law loved it when added to the bottle of water they are always carrying around.  They said that they would buy it for their water and try other flavors as well.  I like that it has no calories, but not the added sucralose.  I am not sure about the price...seems a little pricey to me, but I may be tempted to try the peach tea.

review/summary: Tastes OK and handy, but prefer real H2O or tea
review/text: This flavor enhancer for water does work and tastes OK, but I don't find any value for me. I prefer plain water or real tea. But, some people might find it good because it is easy to bring along  and use when on an outing if one definitely isn't satisfied with just water. Plus, it has no calories, so will work for diet-conscious people. The only real negative is it adds an artificial ingredient to water, so there is some risk, probably negligible, but, at least for me, I would never buy it.

review/summary: Great for Flavored Water
review/text: For those of us striving to increase our daily water intake, this is a great item to give water a little something special. I am not the biggest fan of some of the Crstal Light flavorings (which never seem to dissolve 100%). This is a little different. Instead of a powder, it starts out as a liquid, which mixes and swirls into your water very easily.<br /><br />The container is small enough that you could easily bring it on vaction or day to day travel.<br /><br />Midway down the ingredient list, is "sucralose" (which I'm not a big fan of), so I don't drink tons of it. That is the only "negative" I can think of.<br /><br />Mostly, I am a plain water drinker, but it is nice to have a flavored water that doesn't add carbs or calories to the waistline.<br /><br />I think this is a much better product than some of the others I have tried. I will be buying this again!

review/summary: Excellent diet sweet tea.
review/text: I used to occasionally buy the Crystal Light Sweet Tea product in the summer, but the Aspartame (Nutra Sweet) Sweetener in Crystal Light would always give me headaches. The CL powder tasted kind of fake tasting to me and a little too strong.  MIO Sweet Tea, on the other hand, is a pleasant tasting liquid with good sweet tea flavor without being too sweet or strong/harsh tasting, like the CL powder.  I also like the fact that you can just slip it in to your drink without having to make an entire pitcher of the stuff.  Very clean, sweet(but not sickly) tasting tea, and there's zero calories per serving!

review/summary: It Tastes Better Than Water But.....
review/text: MIO has created a number of liquid additives for water that add no sugar or calories to that wonderful H2O.  It is meant to give you something of a taste outside of plain old water, and I applaud them for this.  I also like the idea of having a portable container of "additive" so that I can drink it with water anywhere I go.<br /><br />What I'm not so wild about is the flavor of the MIO Sweet Tea additive.  It isn't bad, mind you.  It's just not the best tasting tea mix I've ever had.  In fact, no "additive" tea mix that I've come across (powdered or liquid) has ever suited my taste.  If I want tea, specifically sweet tea, I'll brew some at home and drink the real deal.<br /><br />This MIO additive is only good if you're on the go and are either too cheap to order sweet tea off of a menu or buy it in a pre-packaged bottle and opt for free water instead.  It's also good if you want some flavor added to your water.<br /><br />Overall, it's a really good idea and an okay tasting additive, but I'll stick with real sweet tea instead.

review/summary: The Third MIO Flavor I've Tried...
review/text: I regularly drink herbal iced teas at home, but I also bring powdered flavor packets and bottled water to drink at work.  I much prefer the flavor of real iced tea, but flavored water can be a good convenient and cost effective drink while away from home.  The MIO flavoring is a good concept for flavoring water easily since you don't have to deal with messy powders  (which often seem to spill and go everywhere), but it has some flaws that keep it from being a great product.<br /><br />This is the third flavor of MIO I've tried, (the other two were the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea).  The Peach Tea is still the best as far as I'm concerned, but the Sweet Tea flavor is decent.  It wouldn't fool anyone into thinking it was real Sweet Tea, but it's still drinkable (although it can have a slightly bitter aftertaste). As far as taste goes, it's about on par with various powdered flavor packets I've tried.  If you are interested in MIO, you might want to just try the Peach Tea one first because it was the best tasting of the three I've tried.

review/summary: Almost did not try this
review/text: After reading some of the first reviews I almost did not try this. A week later and some better reviews I decided too try it myself. What I found was MiO is delicious when drank; but for me this left an almost numb like sensation on my tongue which went away as soon as I ate something. Maybe I had some reaction but I found it minor but noticeable. That aside it is convenient in that you decide how much flavoring you will have in your drink by the amount  that you dispense into your water.  The flavor is as good as any instant drink mix. And is the easiest additive for a flavored drink I have used. I will not get this again but it is worth a try.

review/summary: MUCH better than powdered portables!
review/text: Sufficient to say that MIO Sweet Tea has a great taste in a convenient form. There are lots of drink mixes out there that are designed with portability in mind. However, this one has the added bonus of allowing you to truly measure out as much as you want -- light tea or screamin' sweet. The little envelopes of powdered drinks could, in theory, be portioned out in lesser amounts, but those packets are impossible to re-close.<br /><br />I just think that MIO is such a great idea, that I most definitely plan on trying out various other flavors. If they are as good as the Sweet Tea flavor, I am a fan for life!

review/summary: portable sweet tea  is nice to have on hand
review/text: Mio  sweet tea is a concentrated liquid you squeeze into water  to make a drink. It is nice tasting,if not gourmet, disperses quickly in water even without stirring and is very portable. I really enjoy having this on hand when I'm not in the mood for plain  water. I must like  my Mio less concentrated than average or maybe I use smaller glasses but I usually get more than 24 drinks from a bottle. The bottle is a plastic, somewhat tear shaped grey squeeze container with an attached snap on lid. The bottle is about palm sized and can easily fit into a pocket  or purse/bag. I have not had any problems with leakage or breaking.  I like the other Mio flavors better than than the slightly lemony taste of Mio sweet tea though I will get this again I have also used it when i needed a shot of tea flavor in a cooked poultry dish and as an ingredient in cocktails and punches.

review/summary: Better than what I expected it to be
review/text: I'd tried another flavor from Mio and hated it. It had too much of a chemical-y taste to it and just didn't seem to live up to all of the hype that had been going on about it. I decided to give the mix another try via Vine, so I tried this flavor. The flavor is about what I expected as well as a little better.<br /><br />The good about this flavor is that it's drinkable. If you're any type of Southern person then you're going to be disappointed in some regards to this flavor because it doesn't come close to matching real sweet tea, so don't even begin to have any hopes for that. However, apart from that this actually isn't that bad flavor-wise. Yes, you can instantly tell that this is a mix of chemical tastes rather than a tall glass of proper sweet tea, but for a chemical drink it isn't bad. I actually didn't mind finishing off the glass I'd made.<br /><br />The bad is that the mix looks completely unappetizing going into the water and that somehow I still felt thirsty after drinking this up. It looks pretty much like a bunch of chemicals mixing in with water, but most importantly the chemicals seemed to irritate my throat a little and make me feel like I was still thirsty. However, I'm more than willing to accept that maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me.<br /><br />Overall this isn't bad, but it isn't great either. If it's on sale I might pick this flavor up to throw in a picnic basket and as far as non-real sweet tea goes, it's not bad. It's just that this isn't exactly something I want to run out and buy either.

review/summary: Kind of a miss
review/text: I love sweet Tea and I am not even a southerner.  There is something special about sweet tea that when it is mixed right, it tastes wonderful.  Unfortunately, this sweet tea concentrate missed the mark.<br /><br />First of all, the package was leaking upon arrival.  Not too much to return the product.  When I opened it, the mixture had an artificial candy-like scent.  Okay, it is suppose to be sweet.  The big problem was the instructions.  "Just a few drops."  Huh?  Not to be overly anal but do you mean short drops or long drops.  Is a few 3, 4, 5, or more?  Without a clear measurement, it is hard to find that "sweet spot".  McDonalds use a syrup concentration such as this one (I assume) and the flavor is always consistent.  That is important to me.  If they want to improve on the product, add something like � teaspoon per 8 oz water or something similar.  Otherwise, if you want to experiment with getting just the right ratio of mix to water, have at it.  I don't have time and if I did, chances are I would never get it perfect again.

review/summary: Too Much Control
review/text: I can't get the hang of this MIO liquid coloring/flavoring stuff. I feel like there is an optimal amount per ounce to add and that I have gone over or under that amount in every attempt. If I could find the sweet spot, perhaps I'd like the product more. I think I prefer to have a standard dose of a flavor additive.<br /><br />I was interested to try it for a long time and excited when it became available through the Vine program because I had not seen it in stores. When it arrived, I was in a new place with a sink that produced nasty tap water. Adding MIO made it nasty tap water with a funky fake tea taste.<br /><br />Fast forward to after I tried it in filtered water--still a funky fake flavoring taste.<br /><br />I might try it again in another flavor--I haven't had tea-flavored water products before. Maybe a flavor that was just fruity as opposed to imitating a favorite beverage of mine (sweet tea) would be more flavorful.<br /><br />In general, I'd prefer plain water to this stuff.

review/summary: Its ok for a real "Sweet Tea" substitute.
review/text: I am a fan of Sweet Tea but I don't love the sugar. So typically I'll settle for Peach flavored Iced Tea powders like Crystal Light or Snapple to add to my water bottles at home. It is easy to transport and the flavor is pretty decent. When Mio was introduced, I was curious. The fact that it was droplets of flavoring creeped me out a bit, I won't lie. When I was offered a chance to try this one, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />It arrived with a stain on the plastic as if a few drops had leaked on the outer package. Not too big of a deal because it was obviously still sealed. The coloring did throw me off, although it seems to be the thing I noticed most in all of MIO's advertising.<br /><br />Both my husband and I gave it a whirl at dinner. We grabbed two glasses of cold ice water and added a few drops. I think I added 4, watching the coloring dissolve into the water was strange. Then I mixed with a straw and tested it, added a few more, tested again. It was about 16oz of water. Sadly, I was unable to calculate the amount I used because even with the slightest touch, it squirted quite a bit out. After that first few drops, it was just a stream.<br /><br />Once it was to my preferred flavor strength, it was too bad. Often, when I have a pre-made sweet teas, there is quite a bit of lemon or citrus flavor added to keep it fresh. Since I do not enjoy lemon in my tea, I was pleased that this MIO flavor didn't have a hint of lemon. In fact, it tasted a lot like normal sweet tea (without the crunchy sugar bits that fall to the bottom).<br /><br />I will fully admit that I am still a bit ooked out by the adding colored liquid drops into my water for flavor. My husband disagrees, pointing out that it makes more sense, distributes better and doesn't get clumpy powered bits that stick to plastic drink containers.

review/summary: It does taste like sweet tea
review/text: I'm still a bit on the fence about this product. I can say that yes, it does actually taste like sweet tea. But it seems to me that the recommended serving of one squeeze for each 8 fluid ounces of water is a little weak. I've ended up going with two per glass, but everyone will likely prefer a different amount. Once you get the strength where you want it, the flavor is actually pretty good. Tastes a little better to me than the Crystal Light teas. It has a nice sweetness with minimal aftertaste.<br /><br />Admittedly, it feels a little odd to be squeezing in all of these chemicals to my water. But then again...I also drink diet sodas and eat foods with all sorts of artificial flavoring and coloring. So I'm probably the last person who has a right to argue against the notion of better living through chemistry.<br /><br />In any case, I think the bottom line is that it's hard to satisfy every palate with any one product. The folks at MIO have made a good sweet tea water flavoring that is worth a try, in my opinion.

The biggest benefit of this product is that you can add more if its not to taste.<br />Brilliant and I'm interested in trying more flavors.

review/summary: Sweet Tea Without All of the Sugar
review/text: I grew up in a Southern family where my Mother would use 1 cup of sugar per pitcher of iced tea. I have always loved iced tea and have missed it since I had to give up sugar a year ago (let's face it, unsweetened tea with sweetener is NOT the same). So, I was excited to try the Sweet Tea MIO.<br /><br />I love that you can add as little or as much of the MIO as you want to your water. There is no predetermined size and you do not have to shake the water to get it to mix in. You just squirt, swirl, taste and add more if needed.<br /><br />I personally love the taste of MIO Sweet Tea. It is definitely the closest I have came to my Mother's sweet tea without all the sugar. It may be too sweet for some people though. My Husband who's Mother was more health conscience, thinks it is too sweet. The nice thing is that he can just add a tiny bit to a larger glass of water and be able to drink it.<br /><br />I definitely think that MIO is worth the price. It seem like a small bottle at first glance, but it lasts a long time. Southern Sweet Tea drinkers should love it.

review/summary: Better than plain water, but not great
review/text: I tried the Sweet Tea flavor of this product, which is really more "sweet" than "tea." It's not bad, but it took a lot of it to get a real flavor of tea so it won't last very long. In the commercials they show people carrying this in their pockets, but I don't think I'd try to carry this with me. I might keep it in a desk drawer at work, though, to get myself to drink more water. I'll definitely try some of the other flavors because I like the idea of it, and I like that it's all you need - it's sweetened, mixes instantly (which puts it miles ahead of powdered drink mixes that remain gritty when added to cold water) and it has no calories.  It's worth a try if you're not a fan of plain water.

review/summary: Just okay
review/text: It seems like I am brewing sweet iced tea every other day.  Being from the South I grew up on iced tea and was hopeful that this MIO Sweet Tea would allow me a quick alternative for a glass of tea if I didn't have time to brew some.  However, it fell short for a few reasons.  First, make sure you are aiming down into your glass because a little squeeze makes a strong stream and the first time I used it I ended up spraying it 4 feet away onto my newly redone white kitchen cabinets and it wasn't that easy to clean off.  It didn't stain, it just spread.  So aim carefully.  Secondly, I felt like it didn't taste anything like brewed tea.  I kept adding more hoping to get some tea-like flavor but never acheived it.  Lastly, all I could taste was sweetness to the point I thing I could have gotten the same flavor just adding a sweetener to plain old water.  So overall, I don't see the point of this particular flavor.  I did once try the strawberry-watermelon flavor and found it lite and refreshing, so there are good flavors out there but this Sweet Tea flavor just couldn't reproduce the tea flavor for an avid tea drinker like myself.

review/summary: Greatest way to flavor water!
review/text: We really like the MIO Sweet Tea at my house.  Being a liquid, this is so much better than the crystal products.  I enjoy lots of ice in my beverage and the crystals would never dissolve all the way.  The MIO is already dissolved.  Also, I can make the flavor as strong as I want, whenever I want.  The bottle fits easily in my pocket or lunch tote so I have it with me all the time.<br />Unfortunately, we cant always find it in the local stores.  When I found it on Amazon with "Subscribe and Save", I thought I had it made!  Every month my supply of MIO would arrive.  Yesterday, I received an email that it has been discontinued from that service  :(  I can only check every once in a while to see if it is put back into the auto ship services.

review/text: I got the MIO Sweet Tea for my husband, who is a constant tea drinker.  This sounded like something that would be awesome for him to have at work.  He was certainly game to try it out.<br /><br />The report I got back from him was mixed.  He experimented with different concentrations to find one that worked for him, but he still thought it had just a funny aftertaste.  He loved the package, and the ability to have it pretty much anywhere he has access to water and a glass or bottle.  And while he did ask me not to purchase this again, he also asked me what other flavors are available and expressed a strong interest in trying some of those.<br /><br />So, overall, the packaging is ingenious, the concept is great... but this flavor was not a hit in this house.

review/summary: Not quite Sweet Tea, but good!
review/text: I like the MIO idea, that you can flavor water a little or a lot, but basically stay hydrated w/o adding calories or a lot of other stuff to your drink.<br /><br />As far as the success of this particular flavor, I can't say it really delivers the sweet tea experience.  Its just a tad on the bland side, and that's after putting quite a few splashes in.<br /><br />But I might be spoiled in that regard, my wife is from South Carolina and makes the real deal here and there.<br /><br />The idea is great, and its a decent price when compared to the bottles of vitamin water, etc. but this flavor wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />p.s.  I gave some MIO to a friend as a gift, since his wife is on him all the time to drink more water.  He's had kidney stones in the past, but just can't stand drinking plain water.  He likes this stuff, though, so its a good idea for those who need more water but don't exactly like drinking it plain.

review/text: I tried this as I have found other flavors of the product to be wonderful.  Boy, was I disappointed!  It was so grossly sweet that I can't even bear the thought of trying to finish it.  I like sweet drinks, such as Mickey D's sweet tea, but at least that kind has the bitterness of the tea to balance the cloying sugar.  Perhaps if they had added a slightly bitter undertone to it, it would have tasted better.

review/text: I had been seeing ads for Mio for months. And I had always wanted to give it a try but the price seemed to high. So when I had the opportunity to give it a try I jumped at the chance. I am also a fan of sweet tea so I looked forward to giving this a shot. Well it was not what I was expecting. I know it is a zero calorie product but the artificial sweetner used has a weird aftertaste that I found very off putting. I just could not see myself paying the high price for this product. If you are on a diet I suggest using Crystal Light. It tastes great for low calories.

review/summary: Strongly sweet and too one dimensional
review/text: My first impression is that this product is just another way to sell artificial sweetener. I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.

review/summary: Somethig like sweet tea
review/text: This MiO Sweet Tea vaguely resembles "real" sweet tea, but there is no confusing the two. I'd say that it tastes more like the fake taste of a diet ice tea with some sugar added.<br /><br />I've tried it several times but never managed to finish a whole glass. My daughter had the same experience. They always end up going down the drain after we lose interest. I'd much rather have Crystal Light Iced Tea.<br /><br />UPDATE: For some reason, I didn't throw this out. I kept experimenting, and I've come to like it a lot. I find that two hard squirts works perfectly with a pint of water. It is a nice change to just drinking water and it avoids the calories and caffeine in soda. I'm bumping up my review of MiO Sweet Tea from 3 stars to 4 stars.<br /><br />Still, it doesn't taste much like real sweet tea.

I loved that the package is a size that I can toss in a plastic baggie for travel, as it meets the 3 oz or less rule.  As a frequent traveller this was quite a bonus for me. Can't wait to try additional flavors.

review/text: The bottle states this product is a "Liquid Water Enhancer," which is exactly what it does, flavors water or other liquids with a hint of flavor and artificial sweetener.  I tested two flavors, Mango Peach and Sweet Tea.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*Handy bottle; one squeeze delivers enough flavoring for a cup of tea or cold beverage.<br />*No caffeine.<br />*No calories.<br />*No fat.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*No nutritive value.<br />*Contains 3 dyes:  Yellows 5 and 6, and Red 40.<br /><br />I find this a useful product, especially in the evening when I want something with a bit of flavor but don't want caffeine.  I've added it to hot water and hot tea.  I like the handy delivery system.  I could stand a bit less sweetener and a bit more of the flavoring but I will probably keep a bottle on hand as it's quick and easy.

review/summary: Not great but not terrible (and easy to use)
review/text: I can't say that I'm crazy about this stuff - it's not the best sweet tea flavor I've ever tasted (and I'm a fan of sweet tea) - but it's also not terrible. The container is cool - very easy to store and even easier to use (pop the top and squirt it into your water). It does take a good amount of the liquid to make your drink taste like sweet tea; the first time I tried it I used what I thought was quite a bit and still had a drink that tasted like watered down tea. After getting the balance right (too much vs. too little) I've worked out how to balance the amount of MIO with the amount of water, but I'm not particularly thrilled with the sweet tea flavor. Easy to use but I like water enough that I can't see using this that often.

review/summary: A little bit too sweet for my taste but tastes exactly like it says
review/text: I love the idea of being able to enhance my water with this simple solution. Sure, I can brew my own tea and put some sugar in it, but this seems like the easier solution. You just squirt it into your water and drink it.<br /><br />If you are just using this for one glass of water, only one squirt is all you really need to make it taste like sweet tea. It also dissolves very easily and did not require too much stirring on my part before it was blended in. The color does actually look like tea.<br /><br />Upon tasting it, while I enjoyed it as it does taste like sweet tea, it was just overloaded with sugar. I am actually quite a sugar junkie so this may be a bit too much on your taste bud if you're not into too much sugar. In fact, the sugary taste of it overpowers the tea flavor so I was a bit disappointed with that because I love tea.<br /><br />This is definitely easy to use. Just be sure you are OK with a lot of sugar.

review/summary: It's ok but not a great substitute for the real thing
review/text: We make our sweet tea in our house from tea bags.  I was curious to give this water enhancer a try to see if it would be a good substitute for days when I just didn't feel like making a whole gallon of tea.  While I found it to be ok, it really didn't satisfy me as a good substitute for our tea.  The bottle was also a little difficult to use--sometimes it would put out a drop or two and then other times it would squirt out a bunch.  I'm sure there's a trick to evening the flow but I couldn't do it.<br /><br />As a side note, this is much pricier than buying other drinks (e.g. soft drinks), particularly when you calculate the added cost of bottled water if you use that.  I probably wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: Don't be scared by the price, lots of bang for the buck
review/text: The MiO packs are about the size of a large egg, and you only get four of them for $25. Normally, this would be an instant turn-off. However, each little bottle is about 25 servings, so you're paying only a quarter per serving, which actually makes this a really good deal, especially if you're like me and fill up your water bottle at drinking fountains (where I go to school we have the nice ones that use sensors to fill bottles).<br /><br />All that value would be pointless, however, if it didn't taste good. The sweet tea flavor tastes good, but since there's no caffeine, calories or sugar you shouldn't expect the diabetes-inducing goodness of Southern sweet tea. Since it's a squeeze bottle, you can tailor the taste to your particular palette. Obviously, if you like your teas lighter (like me), you'll get even more servings and thus even more value.<br /><br />If you find drinking water bland, but don't want to give in to the temptation of soda and other less-healthy alternatives, this is a very good option.

review/text: Having tried the peach tea version of Mio, and being a fan of sweet tea, I was happy to try this flavor out. It's pretty good, definitely reminiscent of sweet tea, but it's not quite the same. I also had to use about twice as much liquid to flavor the same amount of water than when I used the peach tea flavor. Again, my only complaint is the price; you're paying more for the bottle and the wow-factor than the actual flavoring itself.

review/text: This product is definitely as advertised. You can use a little or you can use a lot depending on how flavorful you want your water. A word of caution, though: if you use too much, you're water will have a weird after taste. MiO is great for people who love water and people who don't particularly care for water. When added to the water (just a couple of squirts) it tastes just like sweet tea. I actually prefer to drink the MiO over juice now because I am missing the added calories of juice and getting the benefits of water. I would recommend this product especially for children. It's hard to get a child to drink water, but with MiO, they don't even have to know that they are drinking it. One last good thing about MiO is that this little bottle goes a long way. Depending on how much you use, you can get 24 servings from one bottle.

review/summary: I've Had Better Water Enhancers
review/text: I absolutely hate the lack of taste water provides, so I was eager to try a selection from the MIO family.<br /><br />I liked the ease of using a liquid enhancer rather than a powdery one.  It was easy to add more flavoring to the water, and the liquid texture provided a more even taste than the mix-ins of its powdery competitors; however, MIO Sweet Tea could use some improvements in the taste department.  I had a difficult time mixing in an amount that was just right.  When using the recommended amount, the tea was weak and had very little taste.  After experimenting and adding to meet my satisfaction, I noticed that the tea leaves a nasty aftertaste.  I typically drink diet sodas and other sugar-free drinks, so I was unpleasantly surprised by the blah taste of MIO.<br /><br />MIO Sweet Tea is OK at best.  I may try some of the MIO fruit flavors in the future, but for now, I prefer to stick with the powdered water enhancers.<br /><br />*An added note:The dye in the MIO Sweet Tea stains.  It was all over the outside of the bottle when it arrived.  While trying to clean the bottle before using it, I ended up with dye all over my hands and had to wash them several times to get it off.  I believe the messiness was a result of the package being sent through the mail in a bubble wrap envelope rather than a box.  That said, I did not factor this into my overall rating.  I am simply providing this as a warning to other consumers, so that they do not risk staining clothes, hands, etc.

review/text: This stuff is very convenient.  A tiny bottle can travel with you almost anywhere(about 3 inches x 3 inches x 1 inch in dimensions and weighing at about 2 ounces.)  All you need is a container and tap water and you got sweet tea anytime you want.  It doesn't even require mixing as the mixture dissolves instantly and dare I say magically as soon as it gets poured in.  The drip spout is drip-free and is similar to some of those new smart drip spouts that you see in the market.  It will only eject when you squeeze the bottle.<br /><br />As far as taste goes:  I found it very acceptable.  It is ZERO calories as it uses artificial sweeteners.  Those of you who have sophisticated taste buds might not like it, but if you don't care as long as it tastes good, then this is the one for you.  It uses sucralose and acesulfame potassium, which at the time of this review are FDA-approved and considered safe as artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: An Alternative to Carbonated Beverages
review/text: Add a few drops of Mio's Sweet Tea water enhancer to a glass of water and it transforms ordinary water into something like the flavored waters you can purchase at the grocery store. The Sweet Tea liquid did give the water a tea-like taste, but don't expect it to taste just like sweet tea. It's more like essence of sweet tea. I found that I needed to add a bit more than suggested to give it enough flavor to my liking. As I'm not a diet-beverage fan, I didn't care for the slight diet-taste that the beverage had.<br /><br />Diet drink fans looking for something different should give this a try. It's a nice alternative to carbonated beverages.
