review/text: Used this to make chicken and sausage gumbo. Tastes great. I live here in Houston with plenty of great Cajun restaurants, and this stuff is in the same ballpark. Easy to use and great flavor. Just add your meat and some fresh veggies if you want to make it even better.<br /><br />Edit 5/14/12 to add: This stuff continues to make my friends happy. Made a big crock pot of it yesterday and nobody could get enough. Great stuff and easy to make.

review/text: If MSG is what you want -- and you want it in bulk -- this is for you. Personally I don't cook with it.<br /><br />My vet recommended it instead of costly pet store products. In a multi-dog household, it does away with that bad habit some dogs have of eating each others' poop. I sprinkle it on their food like a generous sprinkle of salt. Makes the poop taste bitter. It works! Vet says it doesn't harm the dogs in any way -- and that seems so to me. Have been using this for years and years on many dogs.

review/summary: Where were you my entire life???!!!
review/text: Wow! Finally, a company/brand that gets it.  Some of us don't feel like making espresso or coffee in the morning.  We get tired of driving to our nearest coffee shop. We don't want to buy Espresso Doubleshots from the grocery because, even the light version has calories and fat (plus disgusting Sucralose - Splenda). "illy issimo Caffe - No sugar" is exactly what is says it is. a 6.8 oz can of brewed Espresso with no artificial sweetners, no milk, no cream, nothing. It has 15 calories per can...thats because Coffee beans do have oil on them and contain some calories.  Each can has around 150mg Caffiene (I cannot recall). That is 150 mg in 6.8 oz of espresso. Basically, just over the caffiene amount of a dopio (double) espresso from a major coffee chain.  I can add my own non-fat milk and be set, add some cold water and ice if I want...even add some PureVia or Truvia (Stevia Type Zero Calorie Sweetener) which is all natural and much better for you (with no after taste). I can add whatever I want. I basically can put into my body, exactly what I want to; let's not forget the convenience factor of grabbing a can, as you run out the door, and downing it in the car. Best thing I've ever found on Amazon!!!  Life is now complete...I don't even have to leave the house to get good iced espresso.  By the way...the drink I normally get at "The Bux" is about $3.45. A 12-pack on here is $25.00 currently.  If I drink 1 a day, for 36 days - That would cost $75.00. If I go to my favorite coffee house for 36 days - It would cost around $125.00. I don't think there is a question as to cheaper, more convenient, and better.

review/summary: Very convenient, a little pricey
review/text: If you love espresso, but are always on the run, this is a great product. I am a huge coffee drinker, and this, plus the other version with low fat milk, and a little sugar, are both great. I love the option to grab this, black and unsweetened, or the if in the mood, the lightly sweetened version, when running around with no time to brew my own. The quality is very high, and I gave this 4 stars, instead of 5, only because it is very expensive. If the high price is offset by the convenience, as it is for me, give this, or actually any of the illy coffees a try, they are all great. Also, travels with you very easily, as a few of the 6.8 ounce size cans can go in a briefcase, or any bag with ease.

review/summary: Coffee my way
review/text: I really love this product. I usually make/drink drip coffee (black), but sometimes I like some variety, or I don't have time to make a cup of coffee. "Caffe No Sugar" is just the thing! I could probably drink it right from the can, but my favorite way to enjoy is to take a chilled can and pour the contents into my favorite mug along with 2 sugar cubes. The sugar takes the edge off, but there's plenty of strong (and fresh) coffee flavor underneath. It's weird, I never put sugar in my coffee, but this is the exception that proves the rule! The only problem for me is the cost: I could get a 4-pack of Starbucks Doubleshot at Safeway for between $5 and $6.5, which is better than the unit price of over $2/can for Illy here on Amazon. But with Illy, you're getting straight coffee, no dairy or sweeteners, so maybe the expense is worth it.

While it is not like making your own at home or the coffee shop, like I said it is perfect for when you don't have time. I bought these to have on hand for just those times. The only thing that would be better for me would be this item with some milk or cream, but NO SUGAR!

I can't emphasize how bad it was.<br /><br />Although Amazon won't allow returning this, since it is food, they were kind enough to refund the purchase price.  The remaining cans are headed for the trash.

review/summary: Has No Seed  or chunks of fruit in it
review/text: This is more like a jam than preserves. there are no chunks of raspberries in it and no seeds.. they basically strained it and it is seedless but no where does it mention it is seedless. Preserves have chunk of the fruit in it which with Raspberries should have seeds unless they specify that it is a seedless version.  So to say the least I was really disapointed as I wanted the great preserve taste of black raspberry with the seeds. not a kind of jam/puree version.. That a side the taste is good as far as a black raspberry flavor but the whole reason I bought preserves is I wanted the actual black raspberry with seeds. I even looked thru the choices on Amazon of black Raspberry and discarded the ones that mentioned that it was seedless so it would have been nice if they at least were up front about that,because they list in their profile that number 1 ingrediant is fruit.Ok, so where are the seeds and berries? Anyway if you like seedless or need seedless because of dentures etc.. this is a good tasty choice. But if you want the full taste of black raspberries with seeds in a preserve I suggest looking elsewhere.<br /><br />Update June 1 2012 I suggest these two fine examples of what Black Raspberry Preserves should be Blue Ridge or St. Dalfour black raspberry preserves.

review/text: I had to write a review because someone wrote a review that thought it was $29 for one bottle. WRONG. If you read the print it is $29 for 12 bottles which is $2.42 per bottle. I was at the check out line at whole foods and similar size bottles that promote energy are at least $3.50 so I decided to give this one a shot.... I LOVED IT.  It gave me energy and I was not hungry WHICH IS RARE. Throughout the day I never reached for the chips or something sweet. This actually worked! I didn't crash either like some energy supplements. I tried half a bottle the first day and never had to have the other half. It has caffeine and I already drink caffeinated tea in the am so the amount was perfect.  Some days I will finish a bottle when I have an extremely busy day but I would suggest trying half first and see how you react to it. I think I'm actually loosing weight too!

So if you are looking to get yourself all charged, and you actually have a reason to move and stay awake all at the same time, I highly recommend this product. Upon the third shot, the jitters went away, and all that remained was an alert, middle aged woman laying on her couch, watching re-runs of "The Golden Girls" very fast.

review/summary: Not much different from the Angel Hair shape Tofu Shirataki
review/text: I did a review for the Tofu Shirataki Noodles Angel Hair shape and so this will seem repetitive if you read that review.  For those who have read my other review, the only difference is the noodles are wider and seem as if it has a harder texture; but in actuality it just appears that way because the noodles are wider.<br /><br />The first time I heard about Shirataki noodles was years ago and I decided I would try it. I went to Fiesta and got the Tofu Shirataki Noodle both the pasta and the fettuccine shape. Shirataki are made from Konjac yams and the added tofu gives it a harder texture. The noodles without tofu added is 0 calories. The first time I ever made Shirataki Noodles I cooked it like regular pasta (the spaghetti shaped) and it turned into a gel--this was years ago. I learned that was the worst mistake to make and changed how I made these noodles. The next time I made it correctly and tried to eat it with pasta sauce. That didn't work for me, since the flavors did not merry and I was accustomed to the hard texture of pasta. When I tried the Fettuccine Shaped Shirataki the first thing that came to my mind was Lo Mein.  When I made the Fettucini Shaped Noodles with Soy Sauce, some ginger, and stir fry veggies, I realized that these noodles are better with asian style recipes.<br /><br />Always remember to rinse this product first.  To me this noodle has no flavor, it takes on the flavor of what you cook it with.  Be sure not to overcook it and you will be fine.  I personally do not cook it longer than 3 minutes.<br /><br />Update:<br />I did some more research on Shirataki noodles in order to expand my ideas with recipes.  I found that the reason that my shirataki noodles may have turned into mush was because it expired.  It seems Shirataki noodles is still good for a year and even after it is still edible however it would turn to mush if cooked too long.  These noodles also apparently shrink and become thinner, something it seems some people like.  I went to the store where I used to get my Tofu Shirataki noodles, and looked for an expiration date.  Lo and behold, it was expired by over a year.  I even saw some in the store expired by over 2 years.  It seems that non expired shirataki noodles will become alot more chewy if cooked too long.  My mom used it in stir fry, and I have also tried it baked which is also a great idea.  I have been lazy and just use any boullion cube with the noodles and that works fine...I just let it sit in the seasoning for a few hours to take the flavor of the soup.<br /><br />An additional update:  I found out that the government allows a company to list a product as 0 calories if it has 4 or less calories.  On the bag it will say 0 calories for half a bag.  The entire bag could be anywhere from 8 calories or less.  I researched this after seeing a pickle at 0 calories for 2/3 a pickle and seeing an entire pickle for 5 calories.

review/summary: HCG FRIENDLY - NOT Pasta though!  Think Asian Dishes!!
review/text: I had read all the reviews on this product and realized people either hate these or love these noodles.  So, I bought them.  I'm on the hCG diet and everyone was talking about them.  Do you eat them in P2 or not?  There is a huge difference in opinion on that subject, but, I wanted to add something with a little substance about 2 weeks into P2, so, bought them.  I was afraid to open because so many had said there was a fish smell.  But, there was none.  Still, I rinsed them for about 3 minutes in a collander under running water anyway just in case there was a strange taste.  Which there wasn't.  They DO look like pasta, but....<br /><br />They ARE NOT Pasta!<br />I would NEVER mix them with pasta sauce<br />DO think asian dishes - put them in a brothy soup or stir fry (P3 for the stir fry)<br />LESS is MORE!<br />They will "blob" up on you.  You need to pull some strands out and add to your broth.  Just dumping them in won't work - they stay in a blob.<br />Taste is NOT PASTA!  They tend to take on the flavors you are cooking them in.  Personally, I didn't feel they had any flavor, mainly just added substance to my soup.<br /><br />Will I use them on round 2 of phase 2 again?  Absolutely.  They ARE filling.  Everyone warns that if you are using in P2, just be careful.  See how you react to them on the scale the next morning.  Some people do fine, others gain a pound.  Again, I would not make a meal out of them, especially the first time.  Maybe add a couple forkfuls and see how you like them, AND, how the scale likes them.<br /><br />I think the negative reviews were from people that were looking for a pasta alternative.  I cannot emphasize enough that there is no comparison to pasta - do not expect these to replace or taste anything like pasta!  You will be extremely disappointed.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I love these noodles as an alternative to higher-calorie noodles.  Are they as good as big plate of spaghetti? No, but they have only 20 calories compared to 185 calories in your average serving of pasta.  They do smell pretty terrible when you open them, but I have found that if I follow the instructions and rinse them well, there is no smell/bad taste while eating. I was surprised to see the mixed reviews since I think shirataki noodles are wonderful, but it looks like you will either LOVE these or HATE them.  So my advice would be to ignore the reviews (good and bad) and try them out for yourself; looks like it's a toss up as to whether you will like them or not. :)

review/summary: Great Idea...
review/text: I love food so although nothing will ever replace pasta,I love having these noodles. I did not hear about them until hungry girl! She has plenty of recipes using these noodles so I wanted to try them and she has some great recipes for these. But, there are a few things you should do when making them in a recipe to be successful! First, being completely honest...when you first open the bag they smell nasty...like rotten fish almost. All you need to do first is drain them and rinse them very well in a colander/strainer, rinse them until they do not smell. Second, cut them up, they usually are very very long, and than put them in a hot pan on medium heat so that the water will evaporate and while i do that i continue to blot them with paper towels, until they are very dry. It might sound like a hassle but it only takes a few minutes. Once you do that you can make your recipe. They do have a bit chewier texture than regular pasta would, but once i started cooking them this way, it definately helped with reducing that chewy texture.

review/summary: Great Pasta substitute, Your kids wont even know the difference
review/text: House Foods Tofu shirataki Noodles really hit the spot if you love noodles/noodle dishes and prefer to not have the high carbs/calories associated with it these are for you. Honestly these have been on my radar for a few months but I was a little reluctant to purchase due to the price difference between the real pasta and this kind of substitute. I didnt switch to this because I want to loose weight ( I could loose a few pounds though) I bought these because of my childs type 1 diabetes requires that I feed my family a more nutrition packed meal than whats normally preped in others kithchen. I decided to spend the money and Im happy that I did the noodles were a hit with everyone. The bonus here is that  I dont have to worry about any huge blood glucose spikes for my daughter yeah!! She loves these and they really do fill you up and for dieters they dont have many calories way better than pasta. Beware! the water that the noodles are packed in smells like fish so you must open the bag and dump the noodles right away into a small strainer for a rinse then throw those into a bowl and microwave for two minutes. After you micro they are ready to eat ( throw on some ragu) or throw them into whatever pasta dish you might make for dinner. ( Beef stroganoff anyone? we just had that tonight and noone knew I substituted the pasta with these fettucine so if preped correctly you can do the same switch for your family.) I had such great service from low carb u and amazon it was a pleasure shopping I'll be back.

review/summary: Low Carb/ Low Calorie/Filling & Yummy
review/text: I was going to go on the HCG diet and came across these noodles. I decided to try them and was amazed at how good they are and easy to use.  I either put them in low fat broth with veggies or put sauces on them like Alfredo or tomato based sauce. I did not go on the HCG diet because of my doctor's warning, but I continue to use these noodles. You really only have to heat them in the mircrowave with the sauce. They make you feel full for hours (not bloated). You do have to rinse then well before using because of the fish smell, but it is completely gone after the rinsing. I buy them at the near by health food store or Publix. I just wish they had rice shaped noodles too. It is an healthy way to cut back on calories and carbs without punishing yourself. This is the best diet food for ANY diet!

review/text: I agree this type of noodle does and a calimari texture very squeaky and it makes it a little hard to eat.  I am a pasta addict and I would love to find something a lot more waistline friendly.  So I tried this brand.  I am able to eat this and it isn't horrible covered up by a sauce.  HOWEVER,....<br /><br />My post is mainly because of my body's reaction to this product.  I don't have food allergies.  However I seem to have a horrible reaction to eating these noodles.  I have only tried this brand).  The Spaghitti as well as the Fettuccine style noodles both caused monster bloating/adominal pain that kept me up through the night. I am only posting the allergy comment because normally I have a cast iron stomach but not in the case of this product.  I would recommend finding a place in your local area to try this first before you spend the money on 10packages.  I never knew I was sensitive to food.

review/text: Strange smell. Washing the noodle does not completely get rid of the fishiness.<br /><br />Strange texture. Chewy / Rubbery, but this I can ignore.<br /><br />Strange flavor. No matter how much sauce or cheese I use It's fishy and I don't like fish.<br /><br />Summary:  I've tried for months to like these noodles. I can do them once in awhile but if I eat them more than 1ce a week the fishy flavor totally turns me off & the bags sit in my fridge until I through them out.<br /><br />Conclusion:  if you like fish then these noodles will be great for you. They are SUPER low fat / low carb. I sssooo whish I liked them. They seriously are guilt free eating if you like fish in your pasta.<br /><br />Update: 9/24/11<br />Pasta Slim so much better. Less smell. And, do NOT need to be washed. Finally a carb noodle that is edible.

review/text: I have eaten the Miracle Noodles angel hair variety, prepared several ways, and could not tolerate the texture.  The Tofu Shirataki Noodles fettuccine has a much better texture.  The best use I have found is in Asian type soups, let the Tofu Shirataki noodles simmer a little while in the soup broth and they taste good. I do not like these noodles cooked in Italian recipes. Overall, the Tofu Shirataki noodles are an acceptable substitute for authentic pasta since I'm trying to lose weight.

review/summary: Not Noodles, but Super Close
review/text: I love pasta, plain and simple. But since pasta doesn't love me, I need to lose weight. Lo and behold, I stumbled across these beauties. They take some work (seriously, FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS! I'll bet half of the bad reviews are because they didn't follow the directions), but are worth it. They hold sauce well and really let the flavors of the sauce shine through. They do lack that slightly-sweet starchy taste that pasta has, but, hey, I didn't expect them to be perfect. Also, texture-wise, they aren't quite the same. They remind me of slightly under cooked noodles, soft on the outside, chewy on the inside. I saw someone describe the texture as "cartilage" like, and I think he/she hit it on the nose. If you can follow the directions, I say give 'em a try.

SeaTangle also makes kelp noodles that I have only tried a few times but some people might prefer them: Shirataki smell bad before you rinse them but they DO have a pasta-like slimy texture, great for stir-fries, soups etc. The kelp noodles don't have any smell but are a little crunchy, also filling but a different texture.

review/text: I LOVE these noodles!!!<br />These do NOT have that bad of a smell as what people say. They simply smell like some sort of a shellfish when you first open the bag. Some of the reviews made it seem like it was a repulsive smell, and it really isn't. I washed the noodles for about 3-5 minutes and the shellfish like smell was hardly there. Even the "rubber-likeness" of the noodles wasn't all that bad as some say. It is Tofu (which I hardly eat and isn't necessarily my fave). If you add vegetables along with it it's hardly noticeable.<br />I totally am going to start using Shirataki noodles as a replacement to pasta. My mind surely believed that it was the real thing! It's just a healthier alternative to me. The Japanese are smart indeed!

review/summary: Alfredo's Best Friend Lo-Carb
review/text: Low Carbin..? I am. I've lost 102 LBS. I made this into Fettucini Alfredo with chicken and it was amazing. The key is to prep the noodles correctly to remove the aroma. Once you do this, the noodles will take on the flavors of your food. They work best with heavy or deeply flavored sauces. I cooked my noodles with the chicken and mushroom drippings before I added the jarred sauce. So good. All those crusty chicken brown bits just infused the noodles to 5 STAR food......So Good.<br /><br />I have also made them into ramen style soup (again, strong flavorful liquid to infuse the noodles) and it was great too, but I prefer the Spagetti size for ramen. SImple as cake. I will usually make my own soup base (Soy sauce, mirin, sake, beef stock, garlic) but If I am being lazy, I will snatch a flavor packet from a dry ramen baggy (A 0.19 cent sacrifice for Maruchan Ramen in Beef flavor, toss the uber fattening palm oil fried trans fat noodles) and cook my noodles in that broth.<br /><br />To prep the noodles for any application, you must drain, rinse, and dunk in boiling water for like 30 seconds to remove the odor and then set aside until needed. I have tasted them right out of the flash dunk state and they taste neutral-Not fishy at all.

review/summary: Even my CATS love it!
review/text: I'm a vegetarian slowly cutting dairy out of my diet and milk and cheese has been a hard one for me to get away from. I hate the after-taste of soy milk, rice milk didn't do it for me either. I'm allergic to almonds so almond milk is right out, and hemp milk was just "ok" - but only the vanilla flavor, and never by itself in a glass...<br /><br />I picked some of this up at my local grocery store and have been buying it regularly since! It is good enough to drink by the (large) glassful and EVERYONE I've had try it has been surprised at how good it is. My meat-eating-dairy-loving co-worker said "I think this tastes BETTER than milk!" And she has bought some for her own family. Her grand-daughter pointed out the similarity between oat milk and the left over milk in a bowl of sweetened cereal. It isn't QUITE that sweet, but I can recognize what she was talking about.<br /><br />If you're looking for a milk alternative that actually tastes GOOD, I highly recommend you give this a shot.  I wasn't kidding with my title. I poured a little for my cats out of curiosity and they lapped it up like you wouldn't believe.

review/summary: Great milk alternative
review/text: With a toddler who is dairy, soy, and nut sensitive. Oat milk has been a great discovery. She loves both the original and vanilla flavors. And Oat milk has at least 4x more protein per serving than the rice or coconut milks i have found.  But I do have to agree with the other reviews the prices here are high. I never have paid more than $2.70 at the local natural grocery store.

review/text: This is a great alternative... it feels more like whole milk and tastes like oatmeal.  I prefer the vanilla flavored one but they don't sell it on Amazon, at least as of now.<br /><br />Shipping from these sellers is crazy.  If you have a local Whole Foods, just buy it there for about three bucks each.

review/summary: These are Special!
review/text: Although these spices are commonly available in most supermarkets, the Dean Jacobs "Blends" are out of this world!  I can't seem to duplicate them.  Sometimes I use as a dry rub (rub it in well) on steaks, and I sometimes use when making up meat for burgers.  Depending on your tastes, there's a spice for everyone in the Dean Jacobs' line.  Great for chicken or pork as well.<br /><br />I was bummed when we first ran out because we originally found it in the seasonal aisle of one of those large retail "Pharmacies" that sell a little bit of everything.  However, my daughter checked Amazon, and once again, they've come through for us!  We're sold!

I haven't tried to make it homemade, but looking at the recipes I see that you need 12 egg whites... which would be tedious and expensive. Why waste time and money when the cake mix does the job?

review/text: I don't think I will EVER make another Angel Food cake from "scratch".  These aren't quite the same (nothing beats a "scratch" cake) but for the price, this mix makes a wonderful dessert.  I made up a pretty dessert with chunks of this cake, fresh strawberries & blueberries and Cool Whip mixed with crushed pineapple and French Vanilla instant pudding.  Layered everything into pretty footed clear glasses.  Lovely and oh so good.  Also tried it drizzled with Carmel ice cream topping..very good.  Good just plain as well.  Soooooooooooo easy.  I have a little trouble getting it out of my pan, but I think because it's an "antique" should buy a new one :-)  Recommend this product.  Much cheaper than in the store WHEN you can find it there, even when it's on sale.

review/summary: Best in taste testing - all the kids loved the cupcakes!
review/text: I spent several days trying recipes for angel food cake from scratch, separating out and whipping egg whites, sifting confectioners sugar, sifting flour, adding vanilla extract, etc.  We did 2 different recipes, then a batch of cupcakes using Betty Crocker cake mix, and Betty Crocker was the best.  Wow, what a time saver.  I still don't know how they did it, and how the mix could be better but it was.  All the kids at my daughter's 3rd birthday - 30 of them gobbled them down fast.  I put a small pool of fudge icing in middle on top with sprinkles for decoration.  I was worried a little, as each cupcake looked different and not identical at all, but kids didn't seem to mind.  It melts in your mouth!  Delicious mix.  Now I know not to waste my time with home-made.  Other moms advised me of this before saying they use cake mixes, but I didn't understand until now.

The price was cheap, the shipping was free, and the cake is easy to make (you just add 1 1/4 cups of water to the mix). What more could you want for a fat free snack? Right after I take the cake out of the oven, I like to put it upside down on a wine bottle (just like my mother used to do!) and pull off and nibble little hunks of the sweet crust part while it cools.

review/summary: Delicious source of trans fat
review/text: This mix produces pancakes that have a great taste and texture. Although "Nutra Rich" makes the product sound very healthy, it actually contains one ingredient that is dangerous: partially hydrogenated oil. Partially hydrogenated oil contains trans fat, which greatly increases the risk of coronary heart disease for anyone who consumes it. It is estimated that between 30,000 and 100,000 cardiac deaths per year in the United States can be attributed to the consumption of trans fat. In addition, the consumption of trans fat has been linked to obesity, Alzheimer's Disease, liver dysfunction, infertility, and depression. Don't assume that a product is healthy just because it is marketed as such. Read the ingredient list carefully. If the manufacturer would omit the partially hydrogenated oil, I would definitely be a repeat customer. Until that happens, I'll never buy the product again.

review/summary: New chicken ramen
review/text: My wife heard about this ramen a couple weeks ago, and we picked up a box based upon the rave reviews in Korea.  It's ok - not great, not bad - but certainly not worth the premium over Nong Shim's Neogori or Kimchi Ramens.<br /><br />Taste:<br />no strong chicken taste, no strong spicy smell.  The ramen is spicy, but more like a jalepeno spicy instead of a kimchi ramen spicy.  The difference is in the...sharpness...if that makes any sense.  Other ramens have a low and nice hot burn, this one has a quick hot burn.<br /><br />Noodles are ok - nothing particularily special.<br /><br />Basically, I think people wanted a ramen where you don't smell too much after you eat it.  This delivers.  You can easily eat this, have a beer, and noone would probably notice - no dragon breath.  If that's what you're looking for, then this will fit the bill.  No exceptional taste, but nothing which will repulse people if you go to a public place later.<br /><br />Would I order this again?  Probably not.  Personally, if I want ramen, I want something with powerful flavor, because I'm not going anywhere after I eat it.

review/text: This pancake mix is totally awesome.  I'm not a big pancake eater because I try to watch my diet and stick to eating healthy stuff. You cant go wrong with this mix.  It is good for you and you don't get that full weighed down feeling after you eat it.  In so far as taste, it cant be beat.  The pancakes are fluffy and very tasty, not grainy or anything else you may expect from a 10 grain product.  Also, I can mix up a batch and store the left over in the refrigerator for a few days if I don't cook them all the same day.  All in all I am very satisfied with the bobs red mill products and especially this pancake mix.  It will become a staple in my home.  Lastly, although I ordered on line I found that many stores around my area sell this product so you may want to check your local grocery to avoid shipping charges.

I always considered their products superior in taste and quality.  However, when I received these (several) potato soup mixes, I was disappointed in the taste, quality and amount. The cans were about half full and the potatoes were skimpy.  I use their soup mixes as a base for larger soups and found these so different from what I have received in the past.  To top it all off, when I went to Costco shortly after receiving these, I noticed the price was very much lower for the very same product, same can, etc. than what I paid for the product and shipping.  Very disappointed.

I highly recommend it and it's so versatile that you could easily add extra to the soup... For instance, next time I make some I will be adding some diced cooked potatoes and some more onions and some other kind of cheese as well.  They'd be better off making it a 3-4 cheesy potato soup.  No matter the extras though... if you're pressed for time, you'll be mighty surprised with it.

review/summary: Nice hazelnut flavor. Works in Melitta One-to-One
review/text: I own a Melitta One-to-One single-serving coffee maker and purchased several flavors of Java Podz in order to have more flavors available than the limited range offered by Melitta.<br /><br />This hazelnut pod produces a full-bodied cup of coffee with a distinctive hazelnut flavor that is, perhaps, a little stronger than the Mellita version.<br /><br />Java Podz are apparently intended for the Senseo coffee maker and other models that use a larger-diameter pod.  I had successfully used Senseo pods in my Melitta in the past by carefully compressing and shaping the pod with my fingers as I place it in the Melitta pod holder.  The Java Podz, however, appear to have a little more ground coffee in each pod than the Senseo, so it takes a little more care to get it to fit completely in the pod holder.  (The Java Podz is about the same weight as a Mellita pod, but is larger in diameter.)  The Java Podz work well in the Melitta most of the time, with only an occasional small leak if I haven't positioned the pod just right.

review/summary: order never arrived
review/text: I placed an order with you on 4-11-05.  that was 11 days ago. Tracking only showed it traveling around the United States but not to my state.  Now Amazon says there was no order.  You have my money debited from my checking account. I plan to repeat negative reviews as long as it takes.

review/text: Hazlenut from JavaPodz<br /><br />We kicked off our pod tasting with the Hazlenut 10gram pod. A breaking open of the foil revealed a nice hazle nose, and we put it into the Senseo and pushed the double cup button.<br /><br />The "crema" was pretty thick as it brewed, and the coffee appeared to have a nice dark color. We got a nice strong aroma of coffee and preceded to add some milk (1%) and sugar.<br /><br />- good flavor<br /><br />- a nice cup of coffee.

review/summary: Activate is Different
review/text: I hate sport drinks. This one is different. It is beyond awesome. The taste is fantastic. The only way to buy it is by the case. Or it is very expensive. it is not cheap, but worth it.<br />I used to drink 6 to 12 diet cokes a day, no more.

review/summary: Cloying sweet.
review/text: Not a success at my house.  A gimmick to say the least.  The flavor is to sweet and there is way too much citric acid in it.  I purchased a case from Amazon, but will give it away.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/summary: Pina Colada dessert
review/text: This was not available in any local stores, so I got  the 18 boxes , planning to share it with friends. I tried making the Jello  with pineapple juice as the cold liquid and adding pineapple chunks after it started to harden. YUMMY! It actually tastes like pineapple and coconut. The colada Jello is a slightly different texture than regular Jello --less "gelatiny" and more creamy. Made with just plain water,  this still tastes of coconut and pineapple. I understand you can make it with bottled pina colada mix --that would be fun for a party, especially if it had a few maraschino cherries and a bit of rum .

review/summary: Island deliciousness!
review/text: This flavor of jello (shots) was a huge hit at a Halloween party.  Tasted just like the drink.<br /><br />Only observation is the jello itself is a little cloudy, but that was all good to differentiate between the Island Pineapple flavor.  Also a great flavor!<br /><br />Happy with this purchase.

review/summary: Imagine spray painting your salad with awesome flavor!
review/text: I was extremely pleased to discover that the very same product my weight-loss program was selling for an arm and a leg was available online through amazon.com! I initially made a rather large order for this product, and am almost ready to do it again. I've found so many ways to prepare my meals using the mister. It's so convenient too.<br /><br />I love the idea of being able to stay stocked up via the internet. No traveling to the specialty shops to get this product. It's sent right to your front door.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with the Gourme' Mister and with amazon.com.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to anyone, not just to those of you who are dieting. It has a great taste and is fun to use. You can't go wrong.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1BF2">Gourme' Mist Pomegranite Balsamic Vinegar Mister, 6 Fl Oz.
