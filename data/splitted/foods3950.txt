review/summary: This is trash. This is not food.
review/text: Check out the nutrition facts right below the product name on the Amazon page.<br /><br />Is the manufacturer hoping that uninformed consumers have heard the word Omega somewhere and think that it's necessarily good for them? Nature's Path does not tell us which Omega 6s or Omega 3s it contains. Beneficial Omega 3s are those that we get from foods such as tuna and flax. Omega 6s are generally what we get from corn-fed stockyard beef. Or from sitting down and swigging a bottle of peanut oil.<br /><br />Note that this product contains 900 mg of Omega 6s and 400 mg of Omega 3s. More than twice as much of Omega 6s as Omega 3s. The typical, god-awful American diet contains a ratio of 20:l Omega 6s to Omega 3s. Nutritional scientists recommend that we drop this diet and try to get at least a 3:1 ration of Omega 3s to Omega 6s.<br /><br />Large studies are indicating that Omega 3s help the cardiovascular system, reduce inflammation, may have a helpful role in preventing cancer, improve depression in some people and may possibly be helpful in preventing or stabilizing some forms of dementias. Are these studies far enough along to be conclusive? No. Are they pointing us in some healthy directions?  Yes.  Are positive results encouraging more studies - not just lab studies, but human studies?  Yes.<br /><br />The most positive results so far indicate that Omega 3s are very good for our hearts.<br /><br />So, you get 2 grams of fiber from a product that supposedly contains granola, flax seed, raisins, hemp seeds and sunflower seeds. What are they using these fiber-rich foods for? The box?<br /><br />You also get 100 mg of sodium and 14 - FOURTEEN - grams! of sugar, along with some saturated fat.<br /><br />I've been looking for healthy snacks for my pregnant daughter and I'm shocked to see that there is NO  nutritional value in any of the bars produced by Nature's Path Organic. I decided to check out Nature's Path cereals, etc., and found the same garbage.<br /><br />The words organic, nature and nutrition have been prostituted by a lot of greedy companies, but this is the most egregious example I've seen in a while. I'd like to see Amazon pull these products - if we stop buying them and the market disappears - so will the products. In the meantime, we need to keep educating ourselves and sharing what we learn. We need to keep up pressure on the grocery stores, supermarkets, food banks and places we go when we can't to get to or afford our co-op. We need to keep ourselves, our children, our grandchildren and our neighbors healthy, well-nourished and strong.<br /><br />Best to all.

review/summary: Good coffee, but many unsealed pods make this a waste.
review/text: I don't know what Java One is doing, but they're managing to put good coffee in defective pods.  On my last shipment, at least one out of five pods were not sealed...you open the envelope and there is loose coffee all over.  The edges of the pods are open.  This is NOT due to our opening them incorrectly.  The filter paper is not ripped or damaged, it just isn't glued or sealed properly.  Definitely not recommended to buy these unless you want to waste about 15% of your money.  Other than that, I like the coffee itself (when it stays in the pod).

review/summary: MMMMM Great coffee for my Senseo, cheap.
review/text: Nov 2010: Still love this coffee!  I just signed up for monthly shipments, having run out last month and been forced to go back to the Senseo brand pods. Yuck!  Well, they are OK until you've been spoiled by these.  With the monthly shipments, the price comes down to a few cents over $20 bucks a pack and *FREE SHIPPING*!  How can you go wrong with that?<br /><br />I only wish they had a nice sampler pack with maybe 3 varieties of pod and that they would add Ethiopian Yrgichieffe as a flavor.  That's one of my favs.  So what if it's hard to pronounce?  It's great coffee!<br /><br />Original review:<br />Some of the other reviews and other similar items had me very confused as to what I should buy (or even if I should just keep buying Senseo-brand pods at the grocery store).  So, I took a chance with one order to see what I'd get.<br /><br />First thing to say is that the coffee is delicious.  I am so tired of only having a limited choice of flavors with the supermarket brands.  Even the supposed premium varieties leave a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The Sumatra Mandheling pods from Java One taste great!  Not only are they a nice change for me, but the quality is excellent.  Each pod is individually sealed in a pouch and one order contains 14 pods per box, with 6 boxes in a case.  That is 84 pods total at a cost of about 23 cents per pod.<br /><br />The box says that each pod is good for an 8-ounce cup, so that's how I prepared my coffee.  I have a large 16-oz mug and normally would use 3 pods of the Senseo brand (one double-pod holder that I run on both size settings and one single-pod holder that I only run once at the larger cup size).  Doing that fills my mug about 3/4 of the way and leaves room for cream, plus some dead space above.<br /><br />With these pods, I used the single-pod holder and only the large-cup setting, but ran it twice, changing the pod in between (are you following me?).<br /><br />That filled my mug almost up to the top, leaving just enough space for my cream.<br /><br />The coffee was among the best I have made, ever.<br /><br />So, not only is each pod only 23c, but I only have to use 2 pods (46c) to make what used to require 3 of them (at an approximate cost of 29c each or 87c for my mug) to get the taste I wanted.

review/summary: Too Big!
review/text: As a disclaimer, I have a Senseo coffee pod machine, so of course the Senseo pods fit quite well.  The problem with these pods is that they are not advertised for a specific machine but don't fit the Senseo machines.  I've purchased all sorts of different pods to get different flavors or varieties that have fit the Senseo machine just fine, so why can't Java One make pods that fit?  The pods are really good tasting (er' I mean the coffee in them..) but if you use them with the Senseo they actually become dangerous, breaking the lid seal and popping the top of the machine thus spraying hot water everywhere.<br /><br />So, Senseo owners, seek elsewhere.

review/text: These are OK, but not great.  I'm not super impressed with the flavor.  If you're considering these for your Senseo machine, be aware that you really need to pack and flatten the pods in to get them to fit without leaks.  They're just a little bit too thick.

review/summary: It was awesome!
review/text: I have used it many times and the flavor is wonderful. I highly recommend it, it is free of processed sugars and flours. I sauteed chicken in a little organic cold-pressed extra virgin coconut oil and added a little punjabi garam masala, I added the soup mix and I used So Delicious unsweetened coconut milk for the liquid. I served it over brown rice, my family LOVED it!  I have used it in other dishes as well, and am planning to use it in tuna casserole.

review/summary: Breakfast of Champions.."Wheatgrass..NOT 'Wheaties!'";o)
review/text: Since breakfast is the most important meal of the day, I start mine with a 'Smoothie',containing wheatgrass as a base, and then add fresh fruit,(your choice), flaxseed, fresh spinach and 1- 1/2 cups of POM juice. Blend and enjoy. I do not add ice...I drink it at room temperature...the choice is yours again..add or not to add ice. There's something about the wheatgrass that not only tastes good, but I know what it does for the body! Good stuff! Try: 1 cup of 2% milk, 1 lg. scoop vanilla ice cream and 1 lg. scoop of wheatgrass...mix in blender and drink. En-er-GEE, soooooo good!!

review/summary: The coffee is great, but other buyers were right: mysterious punch hole
review/text: The coffe is really great, makes very aromatic, full bodied espresso.  I would just like to review the packaging more. I ordered several packs of these, packaged in bricks of 4, vacuum-packed, and covered with clear plastic. Very impressed because of the efficiency of packaging, very tightly packed. Of the 3 sets I ordered,  one set had one of the bricks with a punch hole at the bottom, seems mysterious since the clear plastic covering the 4 bricks was in no way punched and remained intact. It's just the one brick with the punch hole at the bottom. I wonder how it got that way. Anyway, this would have been 5-stars but for that. Highly recommend the coffee.

review/text: We love good coffee, but are not experts by any means. After Senseo stopped making their pods, we bought the Coffee Duck/Ecopad pack from Amazon but weren't sure which coffee to use in them.  Tried the Crema e Gusto based on high reviews and are happy we did! Best cup of coffee from our Senseo machine ever!  Much smoother and lower acidity than the Senseo coffee we were used to, and can get some nice crema when using the Ecopads. Price can't be beat, either!

review/summary: excellent product, great price
review/text: I bought this to use with a 3 cup espresso maker.  This stuff seems to last quite a while, even though I fill up the holding dish to the top.  The espresso tastes great and in my opinion (if you flavor it right) is just as good or better than many of the coffee products that you can purchase that are made for you (aka starbucks, caribou, etc).  Buying it in the 4 pack also brings down cost quite a bit.<br /><br />Overall, a great product and highly recommended.  It is a very bold flavor, so if you aren't in to dark and bold coffee then beware.

review/text: Guys:<br />Although the price recently went up, I received this 4-pack for $12 shipped (using Subscribe and Save and an Amazon clipless coupon).  Although it has a very high concentration of robusta beans (60 or 70%) instead of the market-favored arabica beans (40 or 30%),  it's the robusta beans which produce such an excellent creamy and rich crema, from both my stove-top espresso maker and my Nespresso machine (I fill my own home-made capsules with this brand...see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UP1M4I">Ne-Cap Nespresso� Compatible Refill Capsules</a> ), and the espresso is absolutely perfect. No bitterness, just rich, dark and flavorful. Would buy again if it goes on sale (the Amazon price is still better than NYC supermarkets which sell one pack for $4.75),

review/text: My girlfriend and I prefer Lavazza over anything. We prefer the crema that Lavazza seems to produce better than other brands. This Creme e Gusto is superb (for a pre-ground). We always prefer to grind our own beans but we like to have a backup that is pre-ground for company so we can quickly make espressos without a lot of waiting between cups. We've tried several Lavazza pre-ground and all are pleasing, this is no exception. you aren't taking any chances here, except for a slightly higher-than-prefered price.

review/summary: Great Espresso, Robusta Causing Headaches
review/text: I love this espresso coffee, it makes such a nice cup of espresso with an amazing crema.  It's very consistent and the flavor is smooth, however I have noticed that I get a major headache after drinking an espresso made with this coffee.  I am making it properly with the right amount of coffee so I know it's not that.  It's also not the caffeine since I drink drip coffee almost every day.  That leaves really one thing which is the robusta beans that is blended with arabica to make this coffee.<br /><br />Great coffee, just not for me and if anyone else experiences this then it's the robusta beans so just try another 100% arabic blend, it comes out good anyways.

review/summary: Great Coffee, Honey!
review/text: I was enthralled with the coffee I was served in Florence, Italy years ago and brought some home.  Now, it's available in the U.S. and it's Lavazza.  My local market used to sell it and no longer does but amazon comes through for us.  The flavor is intense but not harsh and has a slight mocha flavor (at least to my untrained palate).  The only negative is my own fault by not noticing that I was ordering a 4-pack, so I have more than I need.  After giving one away to someone who probably won't appreciate it, I'm going to keep the rest and transport myself back to Florence every morning.  The grind is fine enough for an espresso maker but also works for drip makers, although you should use less than usual at first.  It's pretty strong.  Americans are inundated with choices of coffee these days, but I highly recommend trying Lavazza if you're a regular coffee drinker.  The price was very reasonable, even with the shipping.  Share the cost and product with 3 friends at first to give it a try.<br />Ciao

review/summary: Best espresso ever!
review/text: I used to buy only coffee that I could grind in the supermarket since I wanted the best possible espresso from my machine. However, I just moved to an urban area where I am unable to grind my own coffee conveniently (outside my home). So I searched on Amazon and found this coffee, which has excellent reviews. I figured it couldn't be better than freshly ground coffee, but that it was better than getting some old gross coffee from the convenience store across the street. Much to my and my boyfriend's surprise, this coffee makes much better espresso than any other coffee we have tried over the past few years (and we have tried many, including expensive coffee from Whole Foods). I don't know about the other blends from this brand, but if you like strong rich espresso, this one is AMAZING. Try it, and you'll see.

review/text: I bought this on a whim after some sporadic experience with an old, trusted roaster....  This is a very nice new taste for me.  It's a bit lighter roast than the two espresso roasts that I have been using.  It's got a nice, delicate taste that asks to be made on the strong side to show its best character.  I haven't bought ground coffee in many years, so this whole experience was a bit of a lark for me but I'm glad I tried it.  I'm using in a LaPavoni machine and a Moka rig and they're both working well with the grind as arrived.

review/text: This is a dark, chocolaty cofee. Grind works well in my stovetop espresso maker. I have tried many different espresso blends and was not sure how this would be since it is a blend of robusto and arabica beans but it is rich, dark, and as others have remarked, not at all acidic or bitter. My new favorite.

review/summary: Excellent espresso mix
review/text: I was an avid fan of the Lavazza Cafe Espresso (black can) for years.  I was about to sign up for the subscription service for this product on Amazon.com when I started reading the reviews about the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. One of my main concerns is if the acid in a coffee will give me an upset stomach.  The Cafe Espresso didn't at all, so I was leery to switch to something else.  I figured I'd give the Crema e Gusto a try and if it was too much for my stomach, I'd switch back.  No worries.  Not only is this a smooth blend, it has a richer taste than the Cafe Espresso.  I won't need to switch back!

review/text: I have always loved the coffee in Italy and it's the only place where I consistently drink cappuccinos - no bitterness, bite or overwhelming strong flavor, just great coffee.  Until we decided to give this coffee I try, we were unable to duplicate that Italian espresso flavor.  Now we can!  We've given up all of our other gourmet espresso blends and drink only this in our lattes, cappuccinos, mochas and Americanos.  And everyone we've shared this coffee with has done the same!  Try it - I'll be surprised if you're disappointed!

review/text: If you are avid coffee espresso drinker look no further. This coffee comes perfectly pre-ground for espresso drinks. This espresso has a smooth rich flavor that is not too strong with a hint of a chocolate aftertaste. Warning after you drink this coffee a couple of times you will be hooked. If I had to compare this to Starbucks latt&eacute;'s, the Lavazza has a more refined and smoother flavor without the bitter burnt taste that Starbucks has.<br /><br />Enjoy<br /><br />John S.

review/text: I tied Lavazza at a coffee house in Milano and really enjoyed the taste. It doesn't have the bitterness that you find in almost all coffee houses in US. It is very full flavored coffee. I couldn't find it in US, not even at small European food stores. I searched online and Amazon has the best deal if you sign for regular delivery. You don't have to spend $300 to $400 for an espresso machine when you have an excellent quality coffee.

review/text: We originally purchased the Lavazza Crema y Gusto coffee pack when it went on sale, but I am re-ordering at full price because of the taste.<br /><br />Not sure if it's the blend or the roast, but it's a superior coffee by every measure. Flavor is full and robust, but not at all bitter. It's hard to describe it's smoothness without hyperbole, but try it once and you'll find yourself at a loss for words also. If you are used to the strength of a French press but want the silky smoothness of a breakfast blend, this coffee is for you.<br /><br />Vacuum packed into foil bricks for freshness. Do yourself, your spouse, and your office mates a huge favor and give it a try - and be prepared to start writing your own five star review.

review/summary: fancy coffee shop taste and smell
review/text: one day recently, i purchased this crema e gusto lavazza when it was on sale, because i know my friend uses lavazza in his espresso-maker, and i thought i'd break out the moka maker again.  well.  holy cow.  i had forgotten what good coffee tasted like, based on my steady kcup habit.  i can barely taste my keurig kcups now, which seem fairly bland, or too sharp, or too...something else wrong in comparison. i'll still use my keurig due to the convenience, and perhaps i'll try using lavazza in my keurig as another review mentioned.  But, i think you cannot go wrong with a stove top moka of this stuff.  it is not bitter, it is not sour, it has no off notes-- just extremely rich and heady, a good hefty body and smoothness that can't be beat.  the outrageously excellent aroma permeates the house like a great coffee shop you might step into.<br /><br />i read some of the bad reviews, and i can't understand the negative comments, just as they can't understand the good reviews--taste is individual i guess!  But, i LOVE this coffee!  it's extremely good, and i will even drink it late in the evening despite the caffeine, due to the wonderful flavor. crazily, i find myself looking forward to a quiet weekend morning to indulge, just like you might see on some goofy ad where a woman with closed eyes is smiling in dreamy wonder while sniffing a cup. try this coffee- maybe you'll be lucky to be in the majority for whom this rings all the bells.<br /><br />update: i tried the Lavazza in the Keurig, and it just does not do it justice in comparison to the stove-top moka method. but, it still tastes better than regular k-cups.<br /><br />update 2: i tried this in the Aeropress (french drip type) machine that had over 1000 great reviews here on Amazon, and i have to say, this combo will be my only go-to coffee from now on.  the Aeropress, in addition to being easier to use than stove top, seems to make a less burnt flavored and more creamy brew.  this, combined with condensed sweetened milk (like the Vietnam-french drip type)is heavenly. i'm buying a second Aeropress to have this combo at home in addition to the office.
