review/summary: Coconut is more pronounced than mango.
review/text: One of the biggest challenge to mix more than one fruit flavor in tea is to be able to balance the taste and aroma of the two fruits, so the tea doesn't taste and smell like one or the other. I love real mango and coconut, so when I saw this tea displayed in the grocery store, I couldn't wait to try it. I must say I was a little disappointed because after brewing a cup, I immediately noticed only the aroma of the coconut, and the taste of the tea proved it that way as well. Though there are other brands that utilize Mango and do a better job in their flavored tea, I am still happy that I got to know this Stash tea as there aren't that many brands that use the coconut flavor in their tea.

review/summary: My second-favorite mint tea
review/text: I love most of stash's greens:  they tend to be green (think grassy-flavored, but in a good way), smooth, mild, flavorful, and so devoid of bitterness that they're almost sweet.  I haven't found a better go-to green than stash yet, though there are some other truly good ones out there.  Most of them steep very forgivingly if you steep your tea too short or too long, and this one is no exception.<br /><br />This was my favorite mint green in the world until I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4MV3E">Stash Premium Merrymint Organic Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>, an organic mint and green blend that's also by Stash.  I've introduced coworkers to both and they loved this tea initially, but turn their noses up now that they've tasted Merry Mint.  If Merry Mint didn't have lemongrass in it, I'd be drinking it still!  If you don't have a grass allergy, please do try the other tea.  If you DO have a grass allergy, consider this one.  It really truly will be the best you've tasted as long as you keep yourself away from the other one.<br /><br />I sometimes brew peppermint and green tea together, but only when I'm out of these.  I order them by the hundred and STILL run out--they're good!<br /><br />A word on the 100-count boxes:  I've purchased about five of these in different flavors, and they pack these TIGHTLY.  I appreciate the green use of minimal materials, and no bag has ever been torn open, but they're often too wrinkled to redistribute as gifts or for resale.  Not always, but often.<br /><br />Edit:I neglected to mention that this also ices well. Many stash teas don't: they develop a film of flavor oil on the top. This one doesn't suffer from that as badly, but you can minimize that effect by putting your tea bags into cold or room-temperature water and allowing for a longer steep and a milder flavor. It actually makes excellent flavored water if you want something even more refreshing than tea.<br /><br />An update:  this has lemongrass in it, too!  Drat!  Both of my favorite mints will have to be a sometimes-tea, probably in winter when I'm not feeling stuffy!  When my allergies are acting up I'll have to revert to finding a lovely herbal mint tea to brew side-by-side with my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4F1QS">Stash Premium Decaf Premium Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a>.

review/summary: He LOVED the tea!
review/text: My boyfriend likes Earl Grey tea, and had mentioned that he loves the Bergamot smell. One day he commented that he could barely smell the bergamot in most teas. I purchased this 100-count box of Double Bergamot Earl Grey Tea as part of his birthday gift in October, 2011 after reading the reviews. At first, he thought the tea was the norm and that he would be drinking this tea for years. But, after that, he has commented repeatedly that "his tea" is better than any other because of the extra bergamot flavor/content. He is one happy boyfriend. Thanks.

review/summary: Stash makes good tea
review/text: I really enjoy tea and drink two or three 16 ounce cups a day, especially when it's cold outside. I used to drink mostly Twinings and Bigelow because hey, that's what they had at the supermarket. But I tried Stash a few years ago and have slowly switched to drinking it almost exclusively. They make wonderful flavours and have very reasonable prices. I particularly appreciate being able to buy 100 sealed bags at a time from Amazon, because that really lowers the price. And as long as you can set aside the minimal storage space, it isn't as though sealed tea bags go bad!<br /><br />Chai Spice Black is my preferred morning tea blend. It has more caffeine and more flavour than the other teas I drink later in the day. It's tasty and smells good, and the tea is consistent from bag to bag (to bag to bag to bag! I've been drinking this stuff for a few years now. :)

I thought I would drink the Good Earth Tea daily and the Christmas Tea as an occasional change of pace.  Instead I find myself reaching for the Christmas Tea every day.  It has now become my favorite tea (I just ordered a second box).<br /><br />With most teas you want to remove the teabag after several minutes of soaking or the tea will get bitter.  This tea is very mild.  By simply leaving the teabag in the pot I get two or three cups of tea from each bag, with no bitter taste.<br /><br />At a cost of only 14 cents per bag, every day can be Christmas!

review/summary: The best green tea is Chai
review/text: I love Chai. But, I know that green tea is healthy, right? Well, green tea, let's face it, often tastes a lot like grass. Stash's Green Chai is green tea at its best. It's a nice blend of spices that really does taste very much like my favorite Chai. So, go ahead, enjoy Chai and feel good about drinking healthy green tea too. Just let it steep a bit longer than you normally would for black tea, add some honey and some milk (or creamer if you're lactose intolerant like I am). MMMM.

review/summary: Great Tea....
review/text: I drink lots of both hot and iced tea. I have been buying the unit of 6 small boxes of tea, which means I have a cardboard outer box and 6 smaller tea boxes for the recycle bin.  But when I ordered this large box of Stash tea, inside were the 100 individual tea bags, which means I have just one box to recycle.  This is a great way to purchase large quantities of tea bags, and from now on I'm going to purchase my tea in these large boxes as long as Amazon offers them. It's much easier than opening and recycling individual boxes. As to Stash teas, well, they're the best.  I love this white lemon, and have not been unhappy with any of their teas.

review/summary: Wonderful flavor!
review/text: This is my favorite flavor of tea.  I enjoy white tea more than the darker teas, and the mix of peppermint and ginger is perfect.  If you enjoy any kind of peppermint tea or coffee (such as those served around Christmas) you will enjoy this tea.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the little white packet shown in the picture) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets.  If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />The only negative I've seen is that a few of the tea bags have "failed."  By "failed," I mean that when I combine them with hot water they sometimes expand quickly and purge a small amount of tea leaves through the stapled end of the bag.  It's a minor distraction (only once or twice have I had to through it out), but it's probably a 4% failure rate based on my usage so far.  No doubt part of the problem stems from poor technique on my part, but I haven't had this problem with other teas.

Still, it is the same Christmas Eve tea that you can purchase from the Stash website and I bought the 100-ct for only a couple of dollars more.

review/summary: Best tea EVER!
review/text: This tea is, by far, the best tea I have ever had. I've tried many different teas (green and white mostly, not a big fan of black tea). I originally tried the white christmas tea at my neighborhood farmer's market during the holidays, but haven't been able to find it since (except for on Stash's website, where the shipping is pretty pricey). So, I got this brilliant idea to try to find it on amazon, and lo and behold, here it is! Shipping was reasonable, and I received it within a week. One thing I noticed that I think they could have done better with was the packing of the tea. The individual tea bags are sealed of course, but they were all scattered about inside the box. One thing I did like also is the fact that the expiration/use by date was clearly stamped on the outside of the box. It's always good to know you're getting a fresh product. All in all, I would say this is a good, reasonable way to purchase hard to find teas.

review/text: Having just now finished 3/4 of a cup of this vapid brew, and dumping the rest down the drain, I felt compelled to write a review that will hopefully be heeded by all.  I usually make my ginger/peach tea by brewing a cup with one bag of ginger tea, and one bag of celestial peach tea, which brings out the very best of both.  So I thought I'd save myself a little money and buy one bag that would, in theory, do the same thing.  I was sadly mistaken.  This being my very first experience with the Stash brand I honestly have to say that I will not be a return customer.  There is virtually NO ginger flavor, and the peach is more noticeable before brewing than after.  In all the reviews I have ever written over the years I would implore you to heed my advice on this one.

review/summary: add one bag of this tea
review/text: I make a container of iced tea in this manner: 1 family size bag of Luzianne green tea. Add 1 family size bag of black tea. Add one bag of Stash's Double Bergamot, and some grated lemon zest.<br />The double bergamot tea gives an extra zing.<br />Then I fill the coffee-maker to 12 and that makes a container of tea. The ratios work.

review/text: This is my favorite evening tea; especially with a little stevia.  Just be aware when buying the 100 count that you will get 100 tea bags randomly shoved in a shipping box.  It doesn't effect the tea at all, but there is definitely no ordered packaging

I cut a tea bag open to examine the contents and I found NO SPICES, just black tea...This was a total waste of money. I will continue buying a different brand and this will go in the trash, literally!

review/summary: Decaf. White Tea w/ Raspberry: Simple, Unsophisticated
review/text: I ordered this because I enjoy white teas, and decaffeinated white teas are hard to find, which is what I prefer iin the evening.  The taste is simple and clean, which is the goal of a white tea, but is not very exciting.  I would have preferred a slightly more complex, developed taste, but will play with the brewing and see if it improves.  The raspberry is almost non-existent, which is a positive in my mind.  Whenever trying a new tea with fruit flavors, I am nervous that the fruit will be overwhelming, which isn't the case here.<br /><br />While not necessarily a function of the tea itself, I was disappointing that it arrived in a plain cardboard box, with the tea bags just dumped in it.  This is clearly a wholesale lot, divided up for smaller orders on Amazon.  A shoebox full of tea bags everywhere is not very conducive to storage, and I suspect that I am not the only tea drinker that would have appreciated a slight bit of order in the packaging.

review/summary: Disappointed, no cinnamon and no vanilla
review/text: I ordered this excited about the unusual combination. I have been looking for a good natural cinnamon tea since Good Earth Sweet and Spicy went to artificial flavors. And I love vanilla anyway. I brewed the first teacup and after almost 10 minutes the tea tasted like flavored hot water. Mind you it was not a cinnamon or vanilla flavor. More like a watery Chamomile and a vague Sarsaparilla. I put another tea bag in to strengthen it but it just tasted like some sort of cleaner at that point with no cinnamon or vanilla to be found. I gave the other 99 tea bags away. I just found Good Earth Sweet and Spicy caffeine free Organic tea with no artificial anything, so hopefully it will do the trick when it arrives!

review/summary: Best Herbal Equivalent I found to Earl Grey Tea!
review/text: Please keep in mind that Earl Grey (my all time favorite), has a strong Bergamot (citrus) flavor and that's the reason this Lemon Ginger is pretty much the only herbal tea I like.<br /><br />I drink A LOT of tea during the day, mostly black (not so good, I know).  Over the years I have tried different varieties (black 'straight up' or 'decaffeinated', green, red, white and herbal teas) and ALWAYS come back to 'straight' black Earl Grey.<br />As healthy as the red or herbal teas might be, I simply do not really care for the taste of most of them.<br /><br />This Lemon Ginger is the only one that I keep a boxful of on hand and brew it often in the evening (when drinking caffeine before the bed would not be such a bright idea).<br />Taste-wise, it is the closest to the Earl Grey without caffeine, that I found.

review/summary: Great for iced chai lattes
review/text: I love chai... hot, cold, in recipes (chai granola, chai muffins). However, after 2 in the afternoon, I don't tolerate caffeine very well. I got this tea to make Chai Latte concentrate for a nice evening treat. I brew 4 tea bags in a quart of water and add Stevia to equal about 1/2 cup sugar. I keep the quart jar of concentrate in the fridge and mix about 6 ounces of concentrate with about 6 ounces of cold milk, then add a tablespoon or two of French Vanilla creamer. If it's really hot out, I can serve it over ice. If it's a cool evening, I can warm it up on stovetop or microwave.<br /><br />This is a no-frills purchase. The 100 tea bags come loosely packed in a box. That doesn't matter one bit when you're enjoying your chai latte, though! ;-)

review/summary: The same great flavor, just packaged in bulk
review/text: Regardless of how it's packaged, it's great either way.  I've purchased the boxes of 20 and used them even two years past expiration (odd, yes), but the flavor hasn't weakened.  Here, I've outright bought a bulk-packaged box to reduce packaging waste.  You get 100 teabags, each foil-wrapped (same as always).  My review is identical to what I've written for the 6 20-count boxes:<br /><br />Simply stated, I've been drinking this specific tea for several years now after an experiment went (happily) well. Some friends have found it to be too sweet, but they needed to be corrected in that no sugar is required (because they inadvertently added some). The tea provides more than enough natural sweetness of its own with no aftertaste (albeit a pleasant one, if it turns out that you're a little ill and therefore a trifle phlegmy... there, I said it).<br /><br />It mixes exceptionally well with green tea, though I've found not so much with certain black teas like Irish Breakfast -in which case I'd recommend avoid adding milk if you're normally inclined to do so with any kind of black tea. It is decaffeinated, so this is a perfect "unwinding" drink before bedtime. Not "spicy" in the classic sense at all, either. I thoroughly and highly recommend this variety of Stash tea.

If you like your tea sweet, then you might want to add milk and/or sugar to your drink.  I like my tea plain and this tea has a very strong and rich flavor.  This is strong tea and it is a good, hearty drink that will go well with any meal or as a stand alone.  If you are convalescing, then you will want this tea.

review/text: We drink a lot of tea in my house and Stash Premium Lemon Blossom Herbal Tea is a favourite for afternoon tea. The problem is we could no longer find it in the local supermarkets. We turned to Amazon.com hoping to find it and we did! Not only did we find the tea, it came in an economical and convenient 100-count box and was reasonably priced. Each teabag comes in it's familiar wrapper, so you don't have to worry about how to store loose tea bags. This was important to us, because our pantry is in the garage; so once the shipping box was opened, the individual tea bags were protected from the elements. We will be buying our Stash tea from Amazon.com from now on!

review/summary: Not the flavor I expected..
review/text: The only reason for my low rating of this item is the flavor. I was expecting a light berry flavor, but I would compare the flavor of this tea to the taste of FIG-- and it is a very strong fig flavor & scent. I have always loved Stash brand teas, and the quality and value of their products are exceptional. However, if you are not a big fan of fig, or are looking for a tea that has a berry/acai flavor, I would not recommend this one. Instead, I suggest you try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003D4IX36">Stash Premium Pomegranate Raspberry Green Tea, Tea Bags, 100-Count Box</a> It has much more of the flavor I was expecting when I ordered this. Overall, I always recommend Stash brand teas, but be sure you know what each flavor tastes like before you order the 100-count box, as it cannot be returned.

review/summary: Disappointed with STASH PREMIUM TEA
review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used. The Peach Black Tea has a slight flavor to it.  Even if I use two tea bags when I normally would use one it brews a pretty poor cup of tea. I purchased a 100 - count box.  Once again I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch. Although I prefer the Peach to any of the other flavors I purchased, I certainly would not recommend this tea.
