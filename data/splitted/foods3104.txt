review/summary: Great with shakes/smoothies
review/text: We get large bags of mixed frozen fruit, fill a Vita-Mix to nearly the 1250ml line, add water just to the top of the fruit (sometimes we add mixed berries with the fruit), then add the Nutiva Hemp Protein Powder (we use a heaping scoop).  Sometimes we also add in some chocolate mix, sometimes a little maple syrup, it just depends.  There's a distinct but not bad taste at all, and it cuts the "just fruit" taste of the smoothie.  We buy it mainly for the nutritional specs, not the taste, but don't find the taste at all disagreeable, ourselves.  We've also tried the chocolate version - GREAT taste.

review/summary: Way Awesome!!
review/text: First I have to say, that I always want things yesterday, so I have to give a shout out to Amazon for their guaranteed next day shipping!  Yahoo!  Second, I am a first time user of hemp protein.  LOVE IT!!  I don't even mind the grainy texture.  I have already switched to a more primary plant-based lifestyle, so my taste buds and body may already have been balanced enough to not notice any major "earthy" taste.  The really weird thing is that I actually craved it.  I know that Nutiva Organic Hemp Protein is an excellent product because I am normally a picky eater, and if I crave it...something has to be right about the product.  I put 2 tablespoons of the powder in a blender w/ a cup of almond milk and strawberries.  I don't know if it was the hemp, the almond milk or the strawberries, but DELICIOUS!! Normally I would use vanilla whey protein in that same mix, and while it was tolerable/good, I wasn't able to drink it fast enough.  Not to mention I didn't feel full afterwards, and yet I felt the stomach gurgles and cramps like I had just had a full meal.  With this hemp product I feel full, I feel energy, and I can't wait for my breakfast drink tomorrow.  Maybe I'll add some to my lunch salad.  Thank you Nutiva for making such a great product!

review/summary: Strong Hemp Taste, Don't Recommend!
review/text: This powder showed promise with the strong recommendations it received on this site.  At first I thought it was just me and that after a while I would get used to the taste.. not so! I've tried every which way to mask the strange hemp flavor and there is nothing out there that makes this hemp powder taste good.  I love that its an Organic Protein Powder from a plant source but when it comes right down to it, it needs to be palatable and this powder simply isn't.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.  There are better organic protein powders available then this.. it would be worth it to buy something you can use.. I have half a jar that's useless sitting in my refrigerator since I can't stomach the idea of another shake with that strong taste.<br /><br />Keep looking.

review/text: This product tastes alright, considering what it is.  However, I find it extremely difficult to manage puting 4 tbsp. (which is one serving size) into my oatmeal.  I suppose if I made a smoothie, it would be easier, but I don't ever find the time to make those.  I end up using a 1/2 serving size at 2 tbsp. I like the fact that there is a significant amount of magnesium in a serving.

review/text: Please note that the reviewer who said this product was "bitter" and "disgusting" thensuggests that he/she is going to "try" another product which is then named; Nutiva is NOT bitter at all and its texture is just fine. I tried 2 TBSP in under a cup of low-fat vanilla-flavored soymilk and it tasted quite pleasant. I had read that lie right after having come back from purchasing Nutiva for the first time at a health food store and was in dread to test it.I had gone on-line hoping to find it cheaper and this came on as the cheapest source.  I was disgusted to see that someone would be so underhanded as to knock a product that is of such value; the product he/she is pushing is more expensive than Nutiva, btw.

review/summary: Good source of daily fiber and protein
review/text: I usually add this to my Slimfast shakes so I can get some extra fiber and to help with the taste of the drink.  I'm borderline diabetic according to my doctor and occasionally get the low blood sugar jitters but drinking this mix seems to help with that as opposed to just Slimfast alone.  I'm just slightly disappointed with the change in the formula.  It used to be a little finer powder so would mix better and had an extra 2 grams of fiber.  The taste is about the same but now I feel like I'm swallowing a bunch of tiny seeds when I get to the bottom of the cup.  Overall, I am still satisfied with the product and don't see myself changing.

review/summary: awesome taste, extreme fiber-full!!!
review/text: the color if this protein powder is more like the green drinks (grass drinks, wheat grass shakes etc...) but it tastes nutty and has a satisfying mild sweet scent. I love it with a little bit of sweetner.<br /><br />the fiber content is extremely high, so if you are already taking enough vegies and fruits, this may give you a cramp. I usually dont get any upset stomach from fiber tablets or oat meal or anything, but this one, I get too good digestion when taken too much. you might want to avoid empty stomach, because it has stronger effect from my experience.

review/text: I was sceptical of the taste and texture of hemp before I bought it, but when mixed with raw milk, I love it! It has a gritty texture along with a mild and nutty flavor that is not too sweet and does NOT taste artificial like many whey proteins that are highly proceeded. This is done for the sake of the brainwashed consumer who thinks they need sugar (or fake sweeteners) to feel good. On top of that, it offers up a whopping 14 grams of fiber per serving --- not to mention it is an organic product! Nice! Nutiva makes fantastic products. I would recommend this product to anyone.

review/text: If you are looking for a good quality nutritional/meal supliment that is simple and effective this is the one.  The protein, fiber, and omegas available make this product hard to beat.  But it is not for the fly by night diet shake users who are used to highly sweetened questionable nutrition source.  It is an interesting green color with a rough grainy texture.  I enjoy mixing mine in smoothies (good non-fat greek yougrt, hemp/almond milk, berries...)or with organic apple juice. I keep it in a shaker container as I drink it as the heavier granuals will settle if left to sit. My coworkers make fun of it and call it my green-junk, but I am the satisfied one, and not the one tempted to raid the doughnuts or starving by the time lunch time hits. I also mix some up as a snack or before/after a work-out.

review/text: I've tried 3 brands, and this one is much more coarse than the others.  Even with a 3.5 hp commercial blender it still makes the smoothie not so smooth.  I think it may be the ground hulls are mixed in.  I don't know if that would be a benefit or not...more fiber, etc.  Judging from the fiber content of this product, I would say yes.  I do know it would make it cheaper by far to produce, but at least they pass on some of the savings to us.  I'll probably keep some of this for recipes that will hide the "scrub" sized particles.  Perhaps I can make a facial mask and scrub with it also.  ;)

review/text: I tried this hemp protein about a month ago, and I have to say that my husband and I are hooked! We just re-ordered some. We like the fact that it has fiber and protein, and the price is very reasonable. While we are not particularly a fan of the gritty texture, the texture and flavor is certainly an improvement to other protein supplements we have tried (e.g. Spirulina Manna). We have a Vitamix and add a combo of fruit juice, frozen fruits & veggies (peaches, strawberries, mango, pineapple and banana as well as kale or spinach). We toss in our hemp protein and voila! I snack every 3hrs so this shake in the morning is a good way to stave off the hunger.

review/summary: Excellent Choice
review/text: I've been drinking different types of protein powders for a long time now.  This one I would have to rate the best because it's raw, organic and has alot of fiber in it.  Here's the deal:  The serving size is 4 tablespoons and you get 14 grams of fiber, 11 grams of protein, 1 g sugar, a small percentage of Calcium, Vitamin E and Iron, 48% Magnesium, and 22% Zinc.  So with all that said, I use only 1 tablespoon per smoothie shake (banannna, frozen strawberries, dash of organic vanilla) all in the blender and I can't even taste the hemp.  I do this three times a day and I am in heaven because I am actually drinking something healthy and not so processed like other protein powders.  This hemp also has a full amino acid profile.  You can't go wrong with this.  If you are looking for a protein powder with a very high amount of protein in it, then the isolated (processed) kinds will have more, but in my opinion your body can't handle all that protein at once and plus the processed varieties are not good for you anyway.  Just take it easy and enjoy the best of the best, rather than overload on highly processed protein powders.

review/text: This is the first hemp protein that I have tried. Before purchasing it I did my research and read all the reviews for different brands. I was a bit nervous about the taste, but I was pleasantly surprised. The powder itself has a dark green, earthy color and I wasn't sure if it would taste good mixed in milk. But it was pretty good. Granted, it is a bit gritty when you mix it just with milk. But it reminds me of the almonds that I sometimes grind up and add to my smoothies. It's the same texture. Not bad at all. I will definitely be buying this again.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Usually I do a whey protein shake in my daily intake and also do flax seed. I was looking for something different and came across this product and have to tell you that it's fantastic. I now combine the hemp with a vegan protein product and the 2 together make feel fantastic and I almost forget to eat. I am in the weight loss mode so I add 1/2 cup of plain yogurt 1/2 frozen banana, 1 cup of water with my tart cherry and it totally satisfies me and I feel great...There is hardly any taste in the hemp it's very mild but if you are not used to more green products you may not like it.

review/text: I like to put a scoop of hemp powder on my breakfast cereal or sprinkle it on a salad. I've even mixed it into a bowl of rice to add a bit of protein to a meal. I like its nutty flavor. I prefer it to rice or soy protein powders, which tend to taste powdery to me.

review/summary: Makes me think of ...patchouli
review/text: The grittiness is forgiveable (somehow I feel better that it's less processed), the earthy taste is not a total turn-off but I feel calling it delicious is a stretch.  Of 3 different sweetners I tried with it, honey seemed best to neutralize the earthy aftertaste.  It does seem to keep my energy stable, and it will definitely keep you "regular".  I'd give it a 5 if not for the aftertaste because I like everything else about this product and the marketing of hemp as an excellent protein source.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: I regularly buy this product along with Nutiva Chocolate Hempshakes.  I used to add the protein powder to green smoothies for a boost of fiber, however I eventually decided that making smoothies everyday was too much work.  I now add two tablespoons of this to the 4 tablespoons of chocolate Hempshake for a delicious shake with 75% RDI of fiber.  It is true that it is a little gritty in whatever you're putting it in, however if you let it sit for a few minutes it smooths up nicely.<br /><br />By the way, this product is intended to be MIXED with other drinks or smoothies, not taken straight with water.  The reviewers who gave this a poor rating because of taste and only had the powder straight need to get a clue.  It has no sugar or other additives; it's just ground hemp seed, unlike other fiber products loaded down with sugar or other sweeteners.<br /><br />Nutiva makes great products and they really do improve your health.  I drink two Hempshakes a day which means I'm getting 4 tablespoons of this hemp protein powder and I have not been sick at all this year, which is amazing being that I'm a teacher.  I definitely recommend trying this out. Use Amazon Subscribe and Save for and even bigger discount on this stuff.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: This is a great product with a fresh taste.  I am a school teacher and I use this powder every morning and it gets me all the way to lunch without feeling hungry.  I mix it with a banana, half cup blueberries, strawberries, yogurt, and 4 ounces of juice.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a good way to add a large amount of fiber to your diet in an easy way.  The grittiness wasn't at all hard for me to get used to and I am a very picky eater so I figure if it's good for me, it will be good for most.  If you are watching your calorie intake, I recommend using half the designated serving size, I was a little surprised at the amount of calories in it, especially since I add all kinds of stuff to it.<br />Wonderful product!

review/text: I found this product when I was searching for a non-soy based protein powder.  My son (5) doesn't eat that great so I started making him a morning shake.  Since he already drinks soy milk (lactose problem), I wanted to minimize soy in his diet.  He LOVES his 'milkshake' and is the first thing he asks for in the morning.  We mix it with Garden of Life - Goatein Pure Goat's Milk Protein, 440 g powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012NF86">Garden of Life - Perfect Food, 300 g powder</a>, soy milk and frozen banana.

review/text: I had to switch from this Nutiva product to another hemp product (Manitoba Harvest which I buy at Whole Foods) because this product has way too much magnesium in it (48%). Magnesium works like a laxative. That is great if you need that kind of help, but if you don't, it can upset your stomach or at least that has been my experience with it. I won't buy anymore of this one.

review/text: I bought this brand because the normal brand I buy is out of stock on amazon. This brand is not as fine a powder and so it does not stir into liquid.  As soon as you stop stirring or blending it all drops to the bottom. Then when you drink it, the last gulp is all 'sand' that gets stuck in your teeth. So, now you have to brush your teeth or walk around with black stuff stuck to them. There are other brands with as much fiber, more protein and mix right up in liquid.<br /><br />I am sending my stuff back to amazon for a refund.

I found out the hard way that all Protein Powders basically contain Aspartame and MSG.  This is because the Aspartate and Glutamate in the products are in free form and are rapidly absorbed by the body.  If you have any allergies or issues with neurotoxins buyer beware.

The flavor could have lasted a bit longer than it did and I was hoping it would be a little mintier tasting. But considering that there is no other gum that is sugar free and doesn't have aspertame in it that I know of I would buy this gum. I also think that the price is too high, so I will wait till it goes down before I start chewing it regularly.

review/text: I bought the gum so I could do the free super saver shipping.  I was 70 Cents away from it and this was the cheapest thing I could find shipped by Amazon.  It's good gum. All natural and stuff but why would you pay over a dollar for a pack of gum then pay to have it shipped to your house and wait a week to chew it.  You can go to the gas station on your way home from work or school and enjoy the gum right then.  Of course it is all natural for the health nuts which is good I guess.  But my way of thinking is would you rather have bug poo or bug poison on your food.  It's give and take.  Neither is good for you.  In short it's good gum.

review/text: .....for the most part, but I particularly enjoy this brand of peppercorns, as they seem a little fresher. Also, I like the grinder itself; one setting allows for a coarse grind, while the other allows for a finer grind. This is par for the course among the other grinders on the market, however this grinder doesn't wear down like other brands I've tried. So many other brands have grinders that start to wear early, resulting in finely-ground pepper, which isn't always what I want. Overall, I recommend this product as one with robust flavor, as well as having the most durable grinding mechanism.

review/text: First off, Cinnamon has one of the highest antioxidant levels of any spice and even more than many foods.  That said, I use it daily in smoothies, oatmeal, etc.  I didn't realize the difference between "regular" "store-bought" cassia cinnamon and Ceylon until I opened the package and had a taste.  At first, I was disappointed expecting a strong flavor as my taste buds were use to the cassia type cinnamon.  Over the days of use, this wonderful Ceylon cinnamon flavor has grown on me; I can't imagine going back to the cassia.<br /><br />I highly recommend Frontier's Ceylon Cinnamon.  Great taste!

review/text: Not really much to say.. this is ceylon cinnamon. I don't know how to describe the taste, except to say I'm hooked and although I like the taste of the other stuff too, this stuff tastes better. It's a much finer powder then your traditional cinnamon, more like confectioners sugar in consistency, which is normal.<br /><br />Making 2 batches of jello pudding and putting each type of cinnamon in large amounts in each batch then comparing the taste, they are both very good. The chinese stuff is more in your face tasting, but the ceylon stuff has an additional profile of flavors that are quite attractive. I've heard them described as 'citrus' but I'm not sure what I would describe them as. Since I like to use cinnamon in large amounts, and this cinnamon has very little coumarin compared to store bought chinese stuff, and tastes wonderful,  I'm hooked.<br /><br />This stuff was packaged well and appeared fresh from this seller.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: This is not your typical cinnamon! It is incredibly flavorful and fresh. It has a lovely hint of spice, with a depth of flavor and aroma that is very different to the cinnamon found in the grocery store. I was very surprised at how very delicious it is! I am using it on all sorts of food,(which I had never done before) from coffee to applesauce and beyond, yummy!<br />  The shipment arrived well packaged, and in a timely fashion. I am extremely pleased!

review/summary: Great for your Health!
review/text: Once I had the Ceylon cinnamon, I realized just how much of the typical grocery store cinnamon was some kind of filler and not real cinnamon at all. I was interested in the health benefits of the Ceylon cinnamon which helps regulate blood sugar and reduce the very dangerous abdominal fat. I add a little of this to oatmeal or yogurt every morning and am just now beginning to see positive results. This seems to curb my sweet tooth too. That may be all in my head, but I notice that I crave sweets more when I miss my daily dose of cinnamon.

review/summary: I love this cinnamon!
review/text: I've been hearing about the health benefits of true ceylon cinnamon and wanted to begin using it in food and teas.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered online.  Delivery took 1.5 to 2 weeks, but I was not disappointed.  It arrived in a foil pouch, as shown on the photo.  I transferred some to a small spice shaker bottle, and stored the remainder in the foil pouch, enclosed in a ziploc bag.  First, I tried pouring it into the spice bottle from the foil pouch, but spilled quite a bit on the counter.  If you plan to transfer to small containers, I suggest spooning/scooping it out into the container of your choice.  I also immediately made a 16oz cup of cinnamon tea, with one teaspoon cinnamon.  I love this cinnamon!  It smells and tastes wonderful.  The flavor is milder than "regular" cinnamon, which to me, is a good thing.  The texture looks and feels like powder, so it mixes very well.  I can't wait to try this in other recipes.<br /><br />Some have commented on the price of this cinnamon, but when I compare to what I've been paying for organic tea, the tea I make with this cinnamon is half the cost of the organic tea I've been buying in bulk.  ...and this tea smells much better.<br /><br />I definitely plan to purchase this cinnamon again.<br /><br />Update:  7Feb2012  I now add this cinnamon to my coffee, hot chocolate, and protein shakes.. and love the added flavor!  My favorite way to drink this as tea is about 1 teaspoon (or less) of cinnamon, 16 oz of hot water, and lemon juice.  This makes a healthy, delicious tea.  Cinnamon has also been shown to reduce glucose levels, triglycerides, and cholesterol. The smell of cinnamon supposedly also improves cognitive ability.. so I keep it around while my kids study.  I can't tell whether it's working, but they are happier and more alert while studying.

review/text: I needed to buy organic ceylon cinnamon, because it is the only kind of cinnamon that has less than 1% of coumarin, and this turned out to be perfect. It is a lot of cinnamon and will take forever to go through, but that's Amazon is known for, right? This was my first time tasting this kind of cinnamon and it was different at first, but now I love it! It is much softer, finer and has a beautiful citrus scent/taste. I highly recommend this product.

review/text: It is so faint &  subtle the flavor & taste, that I was disappointed. I loved the taste of the Simply Organic brand, stronger  flavor of Cinnamon even if it is the type to be careful how much you eat in one day. Darn.<br /><br />I used 1 tsp for tea & it irritated my stomach, I added liquid stevia then really enjoyed flavor as a tea.<br />I really enjoyed the stronger bite of the other non-ceylon types & did not get any irritation in my stomach. Seems my experience is opposite most others. I have thick blood & needed the blood thinner properties of the other types of Cinnamon....hm..<br />I needed to order toxin free so I went for this Ceylon Cinnamon powder.<br />Maybe it will grow on me now that I have 16 oz of it.

review/text: Frontier Ceylon Cinnamon. Very nice tasting, slightly sweet, slightly mellow, a bit earthy, not as bold or edgy as cassia. Easy to use lots of, so if you use it for the health benefits, pour it on. I use it on oatmeal, rice, cereal, french toast, coffee, tea, soup. I'm looking for new uses. I wish Amazon had it in capsules so I wouldn't have to load my own. Fast delivery, I will buy again.

review/text: I ordered this mainly because I had been online looking for Cinnabon Cinnamon.  I read lots of information and decided I would try both the Ceylon Cinnamon and the Korintje Cinnamon [which is supposed to be the type of Cinnamon used by Cinnabon].  I have to say that the Ceylon Cinnamon [supposed to be TRUE Cinnamon] is OK, but very mild, and smells kind of like cedar to me.  I will not buy it again.  The Korintje cinnamon, however, is perfectly delicious, smells like what I think of as cinnamon, and is cheaper.  I don't really care what constitutes the actual botanical definition of cinnamon.  I just care what it tastes and smells like.

review/summary: More sweet than spice
review/text: I'm directly comparing this to the Tazo  Tazo� Chai Tea Concentrate (32-oz.)  tea.  I've had both for a long time.  The Tazo is much more of a complex flavor with tea, spice and then sweetness.  The Oregon is much more sweetness, tea, then spice.  Both are 1 part tea, 1 part 1/2 and 1/2.  If you are being frugal, consider the price of the 1/2 and 1/2 as well.  Currently, the Oregon is slightly cheaper on subscription.  I've decided to go with 1 subscription of it and after 2 boxes have decided I will switch to the Tazo.  Everyone's tastes are different.

review/text: Never having consumed dishwater I can only imagine that Oregon Chai is what it might taste like.  Having had superb chai at my local Indian restaurants, I assumed (wrongly) that I wouldn't be able to recreate the exquisite experience that is an awesome cup of chai.  I found my exquisite cup of chai by chance ... literally picking a brand at random (Third Street Chai -- -- beyond awesome).  Then I tried Tazo Chai -- -- very average.  Then I tried Oregon Chai... this is the weakest, most tasteless chai I've consumed thus far.  It literally almost tastes like nothing.  I can barely detect the spices that are common in chai nor can I even taste the black tea!  I'm surprised at the 5 star reviews for this product.  If the 5 star reviewers were bowled over by something this tasteless, Third Street Chai would rock their socks and send them into the stratosphere.  Try Third Street, folks... way better than Oregon Chai.

This stuff tasted like condensed milk, it's so sweet it's terrible.  With the powdered tea, you get a rich blend of spices and aromas, with this stuff, you get sugar water.  I was really disappointed- I went straight back to the powder and I'll be giving away the 5 unopened boxes.  Maybe it would make a good flavored coffee syrup or something.  My recommendation?  BUY THE POWDER!  You won't regret it!

review/text: The Chai Tea is way too sweet and I love sweets!! But you just can't get passed the extreme sweetness of this tea. I reduced the mix of concentration to milk. I mix 1/3 parts to 1/4 parts instead of 1/2 parts (1/2 mix and 1/2 milk is instructed ) of this stuff with my milk in a cup and it is still way more sweet to spice. I can barely taste spices in this tea. I love Chai Tea I prefer Good Earth  Vanilla Chai. This does not do Chai Tea justice! If you want to just drink straight sugar and liquid then get this stuff. You would have to down a nice glass of water to quench the thirst this drink gives you after you drink it. It is so sweet that it makes you thirsty even with less mix added than directed. It is like sweet tea rather than chai tea

I prefer the depth of flavor and sweetness of these to other brands such as Tazo or Big Train, or other lesser brands too. Bolthouse makes a good one, but it must be purchased refrigerated, and these mix with water, milk, or soy milk easily and well. The "Slightly Sweet" one is really not good at all; the regular version is SO much better.
