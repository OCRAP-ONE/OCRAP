review/text: I ordered this for a friend as a thank you for helping me with a major project. I had it delivered to myself before giving it to her, because I wanted to make sure it looked OK before giving it to her. Not only did it arrive quickly, but it looked great! Although she has not eaten all of the food, she tells me that what she has eaten is delicious. I would definitely order this again!

review/summary: A solid flavored coffee
review/text: For a flavored coffee, GM's Souther Pecan is rather good.  The instant water hits this coffee, the strong aroma of pecans wafts up.  On a cool fall morning, this can be rather refreshing.  The pecan flavor is not too sweet but quite true to its name.  There is no mistaking that this is a flavored coffee.  Of all the flavored k-cups that I have tried so far, this one is definitely in the top 5.  Not overpowering, but not weak on flavor.  Overall, a rather pleasant change of pace from straight (unflavored) coffee.

review/summary: Delicious..!
review/text: I'm almost not sure if this should be a morning drink or a dessert. It definitely has a wonderful pecan aroma and flavor. My fiance and I also would put this in our top 5 (and I think we have pretty much tried them all...) We tend to lean toward nutty, vanilla and caramel flavors as our favorites, so if you like those you will probably like this.  I found it to be a nice mild coffee (strength can be adjusted by choosing smaller or larger brew size) and as far as sweetness, adjust sugar to taste! If you're unsure about buying so many, try finding it in a variety pack, that is how we discovered it.

review/summary: My family's favorite flavored coffee
review/text: I was in a doctor's office waiting room that had a Keurig Brewer and tried a coffee flavor that was called Southern Pecan Pie.  It was delicious so I ordered this coffee from Green Mountain.  They are NOT the same flavor.  This coffee is a medium roast nutty flavored coffee.  It tastes great with a little cream and I usually sweeten my coffee, but if you aren't big on flavored, sweet coffee, try this one black.  This will not taste like a pecan pie.  Imagine a tray of fresh roasted pecans with a cup of fine coffee... that's the flavor.<br /><br />After trying this one, my 17 year old son declared it to be better than the Nantucket and prefers it to the Vanilla.<br /><br />Also, I don't think you can beat Amazon's price.  I belong to a coffee club and get a large discount and free shipping.  Amazon's price beats the coffee club considerably.

review/summary: Surprizingly good coffee
review/text: I am very fond of Keurig coffee makers. I own two. One at home, one at the office. The one at home is a replacement for an older unit that died. It is convenient, fast and make the right amount (1 cup/mug). However, I am not such a big fan of a lot of the coffee that is available. Most of it seems bland, tasteless, and often a bit pricey, at least to me. However, while not a fan, in general, of Green Mountain coffees I found this flavor, Southern Pecan, to among the best that I have tried (Van Houtte & Timothy's primarily). The aroma is good, as is the taste. I always drink my coffee black, so I realize that I am probably missing out on some of the flavor by not doctoring it up with cream and sugar. Nevertheless, this flavor has become a stable of mine and I expect to continue purchasing it as needed.

review/summary: NOT THAT GREAT
review/text: I purchased the Butterball Turkey Fryer for my husband as a Christmas gift.  He was really excited about trying everything.  The fryer never worked out of the box. I returned it a few days later. We ended up baking the turkey in the oven. He had injected it already with this seasoning kit, according to directions on the package.  Now I don't know if it would have tasted differently fried rather than baked, but it was horrible.<br />We ended up throwing the turkey out.  It was inedible. Fortunately I am the mother of an Eagle Scout and I am always prepared with a Plan B.  I purchased a glazed ham the same time I purchased the turkey.  Christmas dinner was saved.  So I don't know whether it was baking the bird that made the difference or what, but beware if you don't fry your turkey.

review/text: I had just about given up on colas (diet) cause I figured it wasn't worth all the crap they put in it. But, hey, I LIKE cola. Have loved colas since I was a kid and now I'm creeping into pension territory.<br /><br />I had tried the grape and cherry Zevia earlier in the month, and really, really enjoyed them. I decided to try the cola (without much expectations as a former Coke lover).<br /><br />Well, I like it a lot. It's VERY fizzy and totally the sort of cola flavor I love. Without aspartame or weird stuff. Without caffeine...I prefer my caffeine in my morning fresh gourmet java, not my casual summer beverages.<br /><br />If you're a cola lover and want a nice--though granted, really expensive--alternative, here it is. Even if you're normally a stevia hater like me, you might just like this.<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/summary: I got a bad batch, I think
review/text: I received this as a mistake when I ordered the Zevia Ginger Ale. This is my first taste of a Zevia product and I am sure there i something wrong with this batch. It tastes like a mistake. Someone wrote ". It's just a little bit too much on the sweet side, and a bit flat" I can't see that this could possibly apply to the product I received. The can of Zeiva I tried isn't sweet at all (maybe 1/4 as sweet as soda) and is overly carbonated (almost like beer). The one can I tried tasted like carbonated water with a hint of citrus and cola flavor, so I think it's just from a bad batch. I"m afraid to try another can because I got a terrible headache after drinking just half of the first (all I could stomach). I still have the headache a day later. I can't blame the product as it could be a coincidence. I just wanted that to be known in case anyone else has the same experience. Also, as a warning to people who haven't already tried this product, apparently Amazon doesn't allow returns on this item. I have Amazon Prime so I'm pretty sure I'll get a refund, but not sure yet how that will work. To be on the safe side, you might want to try this in a store before committing to 24 cans being delivered to your home and having to sit in your living room until Amazon tells you what to do with it.

review/text: I don't eat sugar so this soda was a godsend for me! I missed soda sooo much.  It's made with a mixture of erithyritol and stevia, and admittedly, I have been eating these sugar substitutes for awhile so I'm quite used to the taste, but honestly, even my husband loves this stuff.  We also have friends who have recently started to buy it for themselves because it's a healthier alternative to regular soda.  Now, yes, I know--any carbonated beverage should be consumed in moderation as it can prevent your body from absorbing calcium (or so I've read) so don't go crazy or anything! I will say though that having a soda with a gluten-free slice of pizza feels just like the good ol' days when all I ate was crap! :)  I also appreciate the caffeine free version of this soda as caffeine makes me a little goofy.  If you love it, do the subscribe and save like we do.  It ends up saving us a good amount of $.

review/summary: Perfect Iced Tea
review/text: I drink iced tea year 'round and in large quantities. I've tried the China Mist Passion Fruit iced tea, and regularly drink Superior's Paradise Iced Tea - and I like this tea even better. It's truly as advertised - a really good black tea with notes of mango that don't overwhelm.

review/text: I bought this gift for my brother and his wife, since my brother and I were big candy addicts in the 80's. He received it on time (which was during the last holiday season) and they absolutely loved it! He thought it was so great to see some of the old candy that you can't get in stores these days. I did not personally get to see the item, but it seemed to make a gift for them and they really enjoyed it.

review/summary: Yummy MILD Cheddar Nacho Dip with PORTION CONTROL built in!!!
review/text: Chi-Chi's Snackers Nacho Cheese, 3-Ounce Single Serve Cups (Pack of 24)<br /><br />These serving size cups are perfect! This is the BEST way for me to keep from over snacking - when the dip is gone I put the chips away. I LOVE this dip.<br /><br />In response to the reviewer who said these are too salty, I disagree. This dip tastes LESS SALTY than the dip I buy at the store. Also, ALL the cheese dips I have looked at have very high sodium content - I think that is to be expected in any dip that isn't created and marketed with a "low sodium" content. If you want a low sodium product shop for one, but don't expect regular chip dip to be low sodium.<br /><br />If you are looking for a MILD nacho cheese dip this is it! This dip seems to be the perfect balance of mild cheddar cheese and light spices/peppers (thus making it "nacho") that I have tried so far.<br /><br />BUT if you are looking for something spicy or if you want sharp cheddar or an overpowering taste of cheese, this dip is not for you.<br /><br />ENJOY!

review/summary: Taste Surprised Me!
review/text: Considering this is not a well name brand I am familiar with I was hesitant about ordering this product. I was really surprised with the taste. It has this melt in your mouth creamy smooth wonderful can not get enough taste. I ate one whole cup alone with no crackers or chips. It looks like it would be hot and spicy because you can see little green & red things floating in it. It has the jalepeno smell too.....so I am more surprised that it does not taste hot! No it is mild as can be. No hint of flames or the down under. So to get the smell and aroma & taste of a good Nacho Cheese dip without burning my tongue off is wonderful.<br /><br />And it is the perfect serving size. My huge family can toss one in each of their bags for on the go. It goes really well with any type herb crackers. Actually too well. I found myself at the bottom of the box of rosemary flatbread crackers and 4 empty cups of cheese.

review/summary: Very,very salty! High sodium alert!
review/text: I tried this cheese sauce to see if it was as good as the "El Rio" Naucho Cheese Sauce. No comparison. "El Rio " is still the 5 star champ. This sauce taste like someone unscrewed the cap on the salt shaker without the cook knowing about it. The cook tries to season the sauce normally and the whole shaker of salt falls into the sauce. It then taste as if the cook didn't want to waste food so the cook packaged and sold it anyway. This may not be true. But that is the flavor it gives me. I opened 1 three ounce cup. I could not stomach even one ounce. It was like licking a salt lick. I threw the cup away. Now I have to find a very bland recipe to use it with or throw it away. Bad Chi-Chi. Very bad indeed.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: This stuff is actually pretty good for processed cheese product. I knocked off one star though because it doesn't have much of any noticeable kick to it even though it has jalapeno and red bell pepper in it. Easily remedied with a travel size bottle of Frank's hot sauce and you really can't beat the price. Beware the serving size though. Each pack of 4 is actually 10 servings as they recommend two tablespoons per serving. One little cup contains over 50% of the RDA of sodium but it is low in fat and calories which is rare in processed products like this. I like that the first ingredient is milk and it also has no FD&C food coloring. For once, Hormel did a product right.<br /><br />As for the shipping, it was packaged very well and arrived quicker than estimated with no damage to any of the product.

review/text: I agree with the reviewer who said this is too salty. It was for me and I love salt. I thought maybe it would make great mac and cheese, but even that was too salty. It's not spicy at all either. I was disappointed. Then I got some Nacho Cheese Sauce in a grocery store that was on sale. It was too spicy, so I added a couple of containers of this and it seemed to balance it out. It's still a little salty but at least I can eat it now. It's a happy medium anyway.

It is a warming fragrant brew great for anytime, but also happens to suit holiday season perfectly!

I thought to myself, "there is NO way that they put anything in here if 'sugar' was the first ingredient".<br /><br />I was sadly mistaken.  The very last ingredient in the list happens to be sucralose--which is Splenda for those who might not know any better.<br /><br />I made a cup and by the second sip I could feel the aftertaste and quickly went to the website to review the ingredients list more closely.  Fortunately, there are plenty of people around that are able to have artifical sweetener.<br /><br />I just nearly missed a trip to the emergency room.<br /><br />Why on earth would they bother adding sucralose after the primary ingredient is sugar?!

At least two-thirds of the crackers are broken, so they do not look good enough to serve to guests.  While not truly stale, they do not taste as fresh as they should, though the expiration date is seven months away.

review/text: Ponzu is often referred to as "Soy with Citrus".  This version is simply a slightly sweet - more sour marinade or flavoring.<br /><br />Although there is some lemon and lime flavor it's main flavor is from sudachi which is a Japanese hybrid fruit more in line with tangerines.<br /><br />There is not a juicy intensity to it and with just a touch a salt you can use it bravely without worry of ruining a dish - BUT as always taste first.<br /><br />Great for marinades, stir fry, or noodle soup addition.

My dog loves Solid Gold Just A Wee Bit dog food and remains very healthy. Amazon, as usual, remains my first and best place to find items that sometimes are difficult to find elsewhere.

review/text: Recently, my 10 year old Papillon has been suffering from dry skin and hot spots. After reading that this might have been brought about by food allergies, I decided to switch his food. The transition period was a breeze and my dog had no problems. It's been about a month since he's been on Solid Gold and he's significantly less itchy! Overall, I'm pleased with the quality of this food.

review/summary: Great eats for a small dog
review/text: We feed this to our 12 pound mix breed and he loves it. Ingredients seem to be a lot better than most of the stuff in Petco or Petsmart. I haven't purchased from this seller because I get it locally in San Diego, but I do recommend this food for small dogs of all ages.

review/summary: I love this food, and so do my dogs!
review/text: This food is full of wonderful stuff, has none of the bad stuff you get in generic dog foods, and makes my "fur babies" full of energy and super healthy! One of my dogs was a stray puppy and one came from the pound, and a few weeks on this food and it was like night and day. It uses only all natural ingredients with no chemical preservatives. And it decreases "stool volume" and smell, which makes cleaning the yard a lot easier!!!<br /><br />Not only that, my dogs love it! I have given them other food when we have run out and I have forgotten to order more, and they just turn their noses up to it. But they also self-regulate. I just put their food in a feeder and leave it down for them all the time, and they are both considered ideal weight for their sizes according to our vet.

review/summary: Excellent food, especially for small dogs
review/text: I have been feeding Wee Bits Solid Gold Wee Bits to my Papillon for about 6 years now and I'm very pleased with this product.  He is a very active little dog who hikes with me all year long (yes, even winter) here in Maine.  I feed him 1/4 cup twice a day mixed with a little bit of whatever we're eating that day; fish, chicken, eggs, pasta with a bit of liquid to moisten everything.<br /><br />A very nutritious food with no by-products.  Yes, it's pricey but worth it.<br /><br />You can buy it elsewhere where it's advertised at a lower price, but be aware that you might find a larger shipping cost.  For example, petfooddiscount charges over $14 for shipping.<br /><br />Regardless, it is an excellent food choice for your dog.

review/summary: Little Picky Maltese Seems to Like It
review/text: I've been told dry food is the best for teeth health etc. but it's so... "dry". He doesn't eat much but so I try to find something he'll enjoy. So far so good. I usually mix a bit of Cesar's wet food for small dogs in with dry food, just for a little taste. I still do but have found that (unlike other dry food I tried) he will actually eat "Solid Gold" by itself!<br />He only eats until full. Since I don't have to worry about overeating I oven put down a bowl of dry food if I'm on the phone, running late, whatever - just in case. It makes me feel better to know he's not eating out of choice. I mean if he's willing to wait for the good stuff, fine but at least I know he's got something to eat and won't go hungry if something delays me too long. He never eats it. To my surprise, with Solid Gold, I hear often hear crunching going on and realize he is actually eating dry food!<br />I definitely recommend "Solid Gold". There's no accounting for taste, even in dogs I guess but it's worth a try!

review/summary: watch out for ethoxyquine
review/text: The high amount of fish meal in this food probably contains ethoxyquine which is a carcinogenic preservative. It accumulates in the liver and causes damage down the road. Unless you can get written verification that this company buys fish meal that does not contain ethoxyquine, do not feed this food. I think it states on the bag that no artificial preservatives are "added". This just means that Solid Gold company did not add artificial preservatives in their formulation (dog food companies are not required to list ingredients which were already present in the meals that they purchased). Fish meal in dry dog food is the newest fad since it is now recognized that dogs need essential omega 3 fatty acids. Unfortunately, these fatty acids have a very short shelf life (a week maybe?)and so dry dog food is not a reliable supply for these fats. Adding large amounts of a very strong anti-oxidant (ethoxyquine, which was developed as a pesticide and later found to be excellent for preventing the oxidation of latex rubber)is the only way to keep fish dregs (i.e. "fish meal")from becoming overly putrid. If you don't have a good preservative, then your dog ends up eating rancid fats which are also toxic. Solution: feed a natural diet of real food. If you still want to feed kibble, buy one that does not contain ethoxyquine and fish meal, then supplement your dog with human grade fish oil capsules. Also, don't fall for the flaxseed gimmick either. The short chain omega 3 fatty acids in flaxseed are not converted to the essential long chain fatty acids that high food chain mammals need. Dogs do not have the enzyme to make the conversion (ruminants do and so do krill!)

review/summary: one star for POOR SERVICE but good product
review/text: My 2 yr old terrier mix has been eating this food since she was a puppy. She loves it & we love it because since switching over to this her skin is no longer pink and itchy! HOWEVER THIS SELLER IS TERRIBLE....Placed order for "just a wee bit" dog food. In-stock item was estimated to be delivered a week later. Well a week later when I was supposed to have received my order I instead received an email from amazon stating they could not give me tracking info because seller had not confirmed that the item had yet been shipped! I contacted seller asking when I would be receiving the order and they did not reply! Meanwhile I ran out of my dogs food and I had to drive all around town looking for a store that carried this brand! (hard to find in my area, which is why I usually order online...usually through amazon from ProbioticSmart, but I tried to save a few bucks with PetcareRx...never again

review/summary: completely not satisfied
review/text: I bought a 15lb bag for my girls a poodle and a maltese and i was so impressed by the packing. the girls even seem to really like it at first. Now almost 2weeks later i will have to give this dog food away to the local animal shelter because it has made my dog's stools soft and oh soooo smelly! not to mention the gas that it gave my poor maltese. They used to be on iams small breed and after all the recalls i decided to change them. i would put them back on that in a heartbeat after this. my maltese has never had problems with tear staining. and now she seems to have alot of extra discharge coming from her eyes. both my maltese and poodle have started itching like crazy. my poor poodle looks at me and whines i know she must be miserable! constantly itching and licking her paws and legs. i'm taking them off this and going to be puttin them on some of our farm dogs food "Purina dog chow" that seems to be better quality then this. I am going to try the Wellness small breed dog food. that also has good reviews but we will see. i definately will not be buying a big bag. good luck to you all!

review/summary: Worth the money
review/text: This is my base rub for much of the smoking and grilling that I do. It is wonderful alone but can be "tweaked" by combining with other rubs and spices. I actually slightly prefer their Low Sodium Original Grilling Spice because it gives me a little more flexibility. For example, I like to tone down the salt on thin items like ribs and the low sodium allows me to do this. But that is parting hairs. I urge you to try this. I find it a little like a Herbes de Provence with granulated garlic, onions and salt.

review/summary: Good oil for hair
review/text: I really like this oil for my hair. It says you can take it as a supplement but I didn't do that. I only use it for nourishing my hair when it's dry. It has a great sheen. I know it's natural coconut oil, but I sort of do not like the smell. But I still like using it every two or three days. To use it, I poured it into a smaller jar and keep that on the vanity for regular use, because it returns to a solid form.  I leave the larger jar it came in sitting in the window, to keep it in liquid form. But I guess you could just scoop it out when needed. Very good oil!

Im applying it now on my eczema , after i take a shower, then leave it overnight. Now its healing and and the itchness stops.Well I love this vco and its has the same smell of what i have in the Philippines,, I bought some vco here in amazon before, but i dont like it, i just forgot the brand,, lol!
