review/text: You can buy fancy jars at your local grocery store that will also be named Thai red curry paste. Mae Ploy is authentic and rich tasting. And in its economy pack it is quite cheap by the ounce. Red curry paste can be made in different ways, but there is no need to own anything else but the Mae PLoy variety for your home made curries.

review/summary: Best Red Curry Paste
review/text: This paste is infinitely better than the Thai Kitchen brand that you can buy in the stores. Its a LOT less expensive, and a little goes a long way. The other brand is very weak and you need pretty much a whole $5 jar to make a big pot of curry.<br /><br />The only complaint that I have about this stuff is that in order to get that nice red color and the great flavor of the lemongrass and thai basil, you have to use a bit more of it, and that means your curry will be pretty spicy. But, that being said, I love spicy curry so this stuff is my favorite.

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: I make a pretty simple curry: chicken, veggies (red bell pepper and a yellow onion)m coconut milk, red curry paste, curry powder, and fish and soy sauce.<br /><br />When I first started making the curry, I used the Thai Kitchen coconut milk and red curry paste you can pick up at any grocery store. It was always pretty good, and the main thing that prompted me to start looking for other curry paste was the $$ of a jar that lasted only 3 servings.<br />We found an asian market next to a vietnamese place we frequent. I went hunting for red curry paste and came across this. Even cheaper than Amazon at $4 a jar for about 3x as much as the little Thai Kitchen ones!<br /><br />I have to say this paste(plus a higher quality coconut milk) has taken my curry to a new level. Comparing the ingredients to the Thai Kitchen paste, the only difference seems to be the Mae Ploy has shrimp. The flavor is amazing, not to mention it has a spicy kick that the other one lacks. When I first used this after the small jar I almost choked at the spice, mostly because I just wasn't prepared for it! After 5 servings of curry the jar is only half gone.<br /><br />The only recommendation I would make is to look for this at your local asian market - seems to be twice as expensive here on Amazon!

review/summary: very spicy!
review/text: This product lasts for a long time when it is refrigerated; I find that the 50g or 10 tsp. that this would be, according to the package directions, is extremely hot even when mixed with the coconut milk and water.  I use half coconut milk and half chicken broth for the sauce. If you can put in some wild lime leaves (kaffir lime leaves),cilantro and a dash of fish sauce, the curry will taste like your local Thai restaurant.

review/summary: Good and Easy to Cook With
review/text: I love curry, with a passion.  But we recently moved to a small community where it's next to impossible to get curry.  So I desperately decided to order this product.  It's very easy to use, I found a ton of on-line recipes and you can season to taste.  I am extremely pleased with this product and so happy that it is available online since I don't think there is really any other way we would have been able to get it; we don't often drive to the city to buy groceries and the small grocery store in town does not carry Thai food.  I would highly recommend it to people who like red curry.

review/text: Good stuff!  If you are planning on making a traditional red curry, I would recommend that you also use some Fish Sauce, we used just the red curry paste and coconut milk with chicken, zucchini, red peppers, and cilantro, and it was definitely missing something, but I imagine that the fish sauce would round it out nicely.

For some reason the region that I am in just has superb Thai restaurants and this paste doesn't even come close.

review/summary: changed recipe and the label
review/text: Two of my three guys would look forward to this product twice a day. They never complained and always ate the whole thing. But when I bought cans (13oz) this week, first I noticed they changed the label coloring. No big deal, just wanted to make sure it was the same stuff; however when I opened the can, the smell was different, the consistency was different - it just felt wrong. The chunky, thick mealy consistency changed to a standard pate. After using this product for a year, it suddenly was different. I didn't tell my cats about it, and just fed them the same as always. They tried, boy they really tried to like it, even switching to each others' dish several times, but they wouldn't do anything more than move it around. That was a dinner - I ended up just giving them dry food. So for breakfast, I tried again, same results, only this time, I heard about it! So, I give this product one star, way down from 4.5 before. Evangers, it looks like you gave in to changing for some reason, but it didn't work and now no sales will happen.

review/summary: Low Calorie Yummy Soup
review/text: I'm buying another 12 bags of this soup after ordering it for the first time just two weeks ago.  It's delicious and easy to prepare in the microwave.  More importantly, it really is only 160 calories for a huge bowl of tasty noodles.  I know, because I gain weight if I eat more than 1000 calories a day.  I don't gain any weight on this soup.  It's a great hot satisfying meal for a cold morning, or an evening late night snack to help me sleep.  Even better is the real reason I happened upon this soup on Amazon and decided to try ordering it -- the soup noodles are made of Moroheiya, a vegetable that is supposed to keep skin young and supple.  It's a staple in the diet of long lived Japanese.  I found that eating this soup on a regular basis does seem to help make my skin look young and healthy.

review/text: This coffee is just the right amount of blueberry taste. When brewing, the smell of freshly baked blueberry muffins spread through the house. It is absolutely wonderful. At first I was skeptical if the flavor would be tasty, but if you imagine the combination of flavors of a blueberry muffin and sipping on coffee, that is the taste of this coffee. I have even mixed it with cheaper, regular coffee--it still tastes delicious and lasts twice as long. In my opinion, this is the best blueberry coffee I've tried yet.

review/text: All in all, it's not a bad coffee and it's priced well. New England Blueberry coffee does have a good strong blueberry aroma and flavor. However this flavor leaves immediately as it hits the pallet, and it lacks that depth that other brews have. The flavor doesn't last, and the aftertaste isn't that pleasant. I will say that compared to other blueberry coffees I've had, it has a strong blueberry flavor and I do enjoy that. The other pro was that it had no bitterness, which was a pleasant aspect of the coffee. Though, if you are one that enjoys a strong, deep, cup of coffee I would try another brew.

review/summary: Delicious! My favorite crunchy cheese snack!
review/text: If you are expecting soft greasy CHEETOS you've come to the wrong place.  The crunch makes you take notice and there are no stained orange fingers as tell-tale signs that you have been in the snack bag.  There is enough cheese flavor and the salt is not overdone, so it is perfectly to my liking.  One ounce in these bags is just enough to tease. Perfect as a addition to your lunch bag, or a before bed crunch while watching the news, but for a midday snack you may need to sneak a second bag.

review/text: I love Barbara's foods! It was my first time trying the cheese puffs. They arrived fresh and crispy. In regarding to the flavor it's okay,very slight cheese flavor for my taste. I will stick to the Jalapeno Cheese puffs that are more my style. Still a great snack for work and WAY better than the other cheese puffs in the market!!

review/text: I read the ingredients and thought these would be a delicious, healthy snack but they are just plain BLAND!  They are crispy and fresh but there is very little flavor to them.  I was sincerely disappointed.  I'm just glad I bought them on sale or I would be angry as well as saddened by the lack of cheese flavor.  If you are looking for an expensive 'crunch' without tongue tingling taste, these are for you!  I can NOT recommend them.  I will not be buying these again!

review/summary: Actually Healthy vs Other Products
review/text: One thing that sets this product apart from others is that it contains vitamins and not just loaded down with caffeine and sugar like in citrus type drinks (which tend to give me a read skin rash). I'm anemic and drink a can of Java Monster (mean bean) every day. If I go a few days without a can, I can really feel the difference especially fatigue. If the company would increase the vitamins to 200%-1000% drv, and added a few more vitamins and trace minerals, this would be a great nutritional supplement -- which would taste better and could compete with products like Ensure. I pick these up for $2 a can at my local Dollar General store.<br /><br />What I recently started doing is taking 1oz of Alive! liquid vitamin (found it here on e-bay for $20 / 30 day) with trace minerals (yeah it tastes nasty, tip: 4 oz of water, stir good, and just chug it.) And I also drink a can of Java Monster (mean bean) with my lunch. With this combo my energy has really increased, without the jitters, I feel better and can't believe that the black bags under my eyes are finally going away. Without the wake-up-tiredness I've also cut down to about 1 cup of coffee in the morning maybe once or twice a week.

review/summary: Best instant coffee I have tasted, including the Starbucks VIA
review/text: You will not disappointed with the quality of this coffee. In the instant coffee scale, this coffee deserves a 9.5 out of 10. Not only does this coffee tastes great with potent caffeine rush similar to a Starbucks brewed coffeee, but it also is also reasonably priced. Its only downside in taste is a very slight acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I use this coffee at work and at home. Instead of going to Starbucks everyday, I now spend approximately 25-50 cents (depending on how much coffee I drink) a day on a similar caliber instant coffee. I think Bustelo should introduce a smaller packet size so the coffee will be more portable for travels.<br /><br />I have also tried Starbucks VIA. Although VIA is also a nice instant coffee, it costs almost $2 (2 packets) per a large cup. At that price, it is actually cheaper to go to Starbucks and buy its fresh brew.<br /><br />If you are looking for the best instant coffee that comes close to a quality of a high quality brewed coffee at an affordable price, then look no further. This coffee will fit your needs very nicely.

review/summary: Not espresso, but very tasty
review/text: First of all, this is not espresso. I'm picky about espresso and this ain't it. It also doesn't taste much like traditional drip coffees.<br /><br />That said, Cafe Bustelo Instant is an excellent drink. I was looking for an alternative to Starbucks Via that was convenient but not so expensive, and decided to try a few on Amazon. This is among the best, possibly *the* best. It's an interesting, distinct flavor. Very substantial, but not bitter. I need to put cream in most drip coffees to offset the bitterness, but I drank this black and enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />At the price, you really can't go wrong. Tired of noxious office coffee? I know I am. I'm taking a bottle of this into the office. I'll still hit a local shop for quality espresso but I'll gladly replace drip coffees with Cafe Bustelo.

review/summary: good for instant coffee
review/text: I think people giving this stuff bad reviews are expecting a freshly ground bean espresso drinking experience.  This does not come close to that.  However, for instant coffee, I still think it tastes better than a freshly brewed cheap coffee like folgers.  Also the recommended use is 1 teaspoon per cup, I use a bit more than that because it is a bit bland unless you use a bit more, but to each his own.  If you are looking for an instant coffee solution look no further.  If you are looking for a freshly grounded and brewed coffee experience with that strong coffee aroma, quit cutting corners and just grind your own beans or go to a coffee shop instead of buying this stuff and complaining its not like a real espresso =P<br /><br />Also, you can get this item for cheaper at javacabana's website if you plan on buying in bulk (cases of 12), if not here is good =)

review/summary: Very Good Instant Coffee
review/text: For what it's worth, Cafe Bustelo is a very good instant coffee. There has been a lot of comparisons between Cafe Bustelo and Starbucks VIA. In my opinion, I wholeheartedly agree with comparison. The good thing about Cafe Bustelo is that it costs a whole lot less. I think it is ridiculous how much Starbucks charges for the VIA brand.<br /><br />To be totally honest though, nothing beats a fresh brewed cup of coffee. Being that this is a instant coffee product, it can't be completely fair to compare it to that. I will say that this is one of the best tasting quick coffee product I have tried so far. There are many times where you just don't feel like (or can't) brewing a fresh cup of coffee and will settle for the quickness of instant coffee. Cafe Bustelo is also not lacking in caffeine I can tell you that much. The instructions say to use a full teaspoon for every cup of water but being that I also add cream and sugar, I add a little bit more. You certainly don't want to add too much because it can get really bitter. You'll have to play around with the amount to use to get it just right for yourself.

It's great even with powdered creamer, which is what I have available at the office.  The term "Instant Espresso" is somewhat misleading.  I suppose at the right strength it could be considered espresso, but at normal strength (rounded teaspoon in about 6-8 oz. of hot water) it is a superior instant coffee.  Even when reheated hours later it is as good as when fresh.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Great for instant coffee
review/text: The coffee we have at work tastes horrible, something like burned rice with sour cherries and bad red wine.  Most of my coworkers think it is just fine so we are stuck with it.  I've decided I didn't want to drink it, and I'm not much of a tea fan, but I need my caffeine fix.  I couldn't find anything in the stores.  This is the best Instant Coffee I've ever tasted.  I haven't tried it as an espresso and I don't plan on it.  I usually usually mix one heaping spoon full with a travel mug of hot water.  My guess is that's almost a tablespoon to 16 oz of water.  You would want to use 1 rounded tsp per 6oz of water for regular coffee and 2 rounded tsps per 6oz of water for strong coffee.  Change tsp to TBs if you are measuring for grounds for brewing.  That's the calculation I've always used.

I found the taste as good and maybe better than Via which I have used as a travel comfort often, as I visit poorer countries where Nescafe (not high on my list for taste) is seen as an expensive luxury and espresso is rare.<br /><br />I now think Via is just all marketing and packaging.

review/text: I've tried all the leading "instant espresso" brands (except Nescafe). This one is ok but not my favorite. For me, it's not much better than "run o' the mill" regular instant coffee for a straight cup of coffee. The best thing I can say is that it doesn't have such a strong "instant" flavor like regular instants. For a Latte, I have to use a couple heaping teaspoons per cup (double what I use with competing instant espresso brands). Wish I hadn't bought the 4-pack. I won't waste 'em, but I won't buy 'em again either. Can I list my favorite here? - Ferrara (so far).

review/text: I needed powdered espresso for some Maida Heater's cake recipes and purchased this one.  Brings back memories of my parents' instant coffee habits of the 1960s--when so much food and drink was ersatz.  Since you had to buy 3 jars on Amazon, I'm compelled to drink it as well as use it in recipes.  It's okay in an extreme pinch.  I don't usually put milk or half and half in my coffee but this is hard to take black.

review/text: This does not at all taste like espresso. It is very weak in flavor, almost no flavor, and is light in color not like dark espresso roast. I wish I could return it. If you want something to taste like espresso do not buy this! I also bought the decaf espresso and had the same disappointing experience.

review/summary: good for instant, but not as good as brewed cafe bustelo
review/text: The original non-instant Cafe Bustelo has a smooth taste, lovey aroma, and is very popular in Hispanic communities. While that is true, the instant version definitley loses something in the translation from brewed to instant, though I hear that's common. I'd only use instant if you plan on adding a lot of other things to mask the change in taste, maybe for iced drinks with cream and sugar, or for frappucinos. In that context, it's convenient and good.

review/summary: No comparison to Via
review/text: I compared Cafe Bustelo Instant to Starbucks Via Instant Italian Roast after reading some of the reviews on this site. I don't get it. Bustelo is not good at all. It may be better than most other instant coffee brands, I haven't tasted them all, but it doesn't taste like brewed coffee or espresso. Perhaps if you camouflage it with enough sugar and milk it's passable, but I tried it black. I generally avoid instant coffee but recently decided to try Starbucks Via Italian Roast (also black). I was surprised at how good it was, very close to brewed. I think it's too expensive to substitute for brewed coffee on a daily basis, but if you need an instant coffee occasionally for convenience it's very good. Bustello Instant on the other hand was not drinkable in my opinion.

review/summary: Malty Breakfast.
review/text: Given that it was a Scotsman -- a 19th century Edinburgh tea master named Drysdale -- who first marketed his particular blend under the name "breakfast tea" (and given that Drysdale's creation would soon come to be (mis)appropriated by tea houses south of the border, who proceeded to add the word "English" to its name), it seems only fitting that the Scots should have their own version of breakfast tea, too, after all. Even stronger than the already potent English Breakfast blend, this particular one is made to match not only the traditionally heavy English but even the Scottish breakfast, which like the English variety includes pork, sausages and eggs, but is amplified by that so distinctly Caledonian culinary creation: haggis (to most of the rest of the world, a classic case of "acquired taste" at best). A blend of primarily Indian teas, Scottish Breakfast contains a particularly high percentage of Assam, which with its malty flavor ideally complements the soft Scottish mountain waters ... as well as Scotland's famous single malt whiskies, the "water of life" ("uisgue beatha") likewise coming from the areas where those same mountain waters are flowing.<br /><br />Due to its strength, Scottish Breakfast tea maintains its flavor very well with the addition of cream or milk. As an everyday "work horse" and early morning pick-me-up it is easily as good as (if not better than) its more famous sibling from south of the border, or any kind of coffee. Enjoy!

BUT make sure you "hot the pot" first and then get that tea cozy on ... I pour it into a big Stanley Thermos but I don't think Grandma would have objected).  I have it every morning to start my day (drank this whole bag in three months ... I take it to work in aforementioned big thermos after my first cup or two at home).  I served it from my thermos at work to a colleague and she ordered it immediately (raves about it ... best tea she ever had).  My Dad, also born in Scotland like grandma, just had a good strong cuppa last night without milk or sugar and enjoyed it as well (Chinese takeout was the meal).  This tea makes me smile when I drink it.  The best.

review/summary: INACCURATE LISTING OF INGREDIENTS
review/text: This tasted fairly well, except, I was looking for RAW nuts and UNSALTED nuts. The ingredients on this ad says:<br /><br />Trail Mix: Peanuts Raisins Almonds Cashews Plain M&M's<br /><br />When the nuts are roasted and salted it should say so, don't you think?<br /><br />Amazon should insist on more exact ingredients when the product is a food or other consumption product. I really appreciate an AMAZON seller that uploads a scanned READABLE image of the complete NUTRITIONAL LABEL that is on the product that they are selling. AMAZON should not charge a seller extra to post that image, and AMAZON should make it mandatory for sellers offering products that are for our consumption to do so. I do not go to a store and buy anything that I am going to consume unless I can read what is in it...it should not be different when I purchase online. I often end up going out onto the internet to look up INGREDIENTS of the product being sold on Amazon. It takes a lot of time and no one should have to do that while shopping on Amazon.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with this one, I thought the ingredient list was complete and never researched it further. So, you live and learn.<br /><br />Also, there are LOTS of M&M's in this mix. If you are trying to eat healthier, you will get several in every handful, and the chocolate taste takes away from the taste of more healthful foods. I cannot fault this for that reason because I knew it had the M&M's when I bought it...just commenting that there were just way too many. I ended up giving a lot of it away because it was just not for me with all that candy in it. Some people may like it that way.:-)<br /><br />Delivery was timely, and packaging was excellent, product was very fresh...but I would not have ordered it had I known that the nuts were NOT RAW and UNSALTED.

My dad always ate this mustard when I was growing up and when I was old enough to appreciate anything other than yellow mustard, I started on it.  I can't get the stuff locally so am relegated to asking Santa Wifey to fill my stocking with it every year.  My only disappointment is that it doesn't come in the larger ceramic container anymore.

They'll eat several other brands and other Wellness formulas, so the reason is not that they only like one product.  The regular formula still happens to be grain-free, so we will not be buying the Core again.  I still gave this product 4 stars because it looks like a quality product and is grain-free and chicken-based.

review/summary: Not fresh on arrival
review/text: First I want to be clear; the coffee itself is great, or would be, if it arrived correctly. The coffee comes in a vacuum-sealed package (or is supposed to come like that). This is to keep the beans fresh, and after the package is opened, you're supposed to store it in the freezer, to continue to keep the beans fresh.<br /><br />The problem is, the packages you receive are not vacuum-sealed. The seals are broken and the beans are at some degree of staleness on arrival. You don't know how stale they are because you don't know how long it's been since the vacuum seals were broken. It still tastes like coffee, you can still taste the macadamia and the chocolate, but you can also tell that it's a bit off-flavor as well.<br /><br />This is a great coffee, but don't purchase it through this seller unless you don't mind receiving stale beans.

review/summary: Not so healthy chemical additives
review/text: This product contains yellow prussiate of soda, an anti-caking agent that is a regulated chemical that seems to be a concern when taken in high amounts.  No surprise as it contains cyanide.  It also affects what you can do with it in terms of pickling and brining.  The USFDA CFR Title 21, v6 Sec 573.1020 regulates it in the following way -- notice that it doesn't say HUMAN consumption:  The exact wording in the Code of Fed Regs is "Yellow prussiate of soda...may be safely used as an anticaking agent in salt for animal consumption at a level not to exceed 13 parts per million.  The additive contains a minimum of 99.0 percent of weight of sodium ferrocyanide decahydrate."  I bought this at the grocery store and am throwing it away.  It may not be "much" in terms of contaminants from this single product (altho they COULD use food grade diatomaceous earth and have the same "anticaking" effect), but given we are being bombed with contaminants like this from all sides in our foods, every little bit of avoidance seems like the smarter option.  I recommend you do not buy this salt -- look for Kosher salt options that do not have additives.  If your salt cakes, you can easily crush it and add a spoon of diatomaceous earth (food grade) and mix it well -- this does a good job as well.  The "convenience" of free-flowing kosher salt is not worth the added chemical ingestion...

review/text: Here my findings. It tastes very salty, so be careful how much you use. Also be aware that it looks like sugar. So if you plan in not storing it in its original package, mark it carefully.<br /><br />Fun aside, Kosher salt is dried sea salt, it can be a bit deceitful, If you have a recipe that calls for spoon measured salts, look up how much ounces fit on a spoon and weigh it. Kosher salt comes in bigger crystals then normal salt, means bigger volume with less actual salt. SO be sure you measure accordingly.<br /><br />There is nothing else I can tell you...

review/summary: The preferred salt for kitchen and table
review/text: Except for baking, Morton Coarse Kosher Salt is what I use in the kitchen and at the table. I prefer pure, plain salt to the somewhat muddled flavor of sea salt. Table salt is much finer so it is harder to pinch and distribute evenly on a finished dish.<br /><br />This coarse, flaked salt is also necessary for topping pretzels and margaritas and making pickles. It is also especially nice topping whole grain loaves and on meat, poultry or baked potatoes. If you have a French recipe calling for "gros sel" something of this nature is what is intended. A nice gift that is easy to make using this salt is pickled lemons, which are very useful in Mediterranean dishes.<br /><br />Note that this salt is less dense than regular table salt. The label indicates to add 1 tablespoon per quarter cup if the recipe calls for table salt.
