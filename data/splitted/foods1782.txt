review/summary: Only average marzipan
review/text: I was hoping that these would compare to Niederegger marzipan potatoes which weren't available at the time I ordered. I was disappointed because they're very different.  Niederegger marzipan is the most nutty marzipan I've had and tastes very natural.  This marzipan is overly sweet and sticky/chewy--it's very typical and nothing exceptional. Pass on this and find Niederegger.

review/text: This product is not bad but not the best either, and I actually didn't realize how small the Kartoffelns are. I had just tried Niederegger before buying this and it doesn't even compare to their quality. This product is VERY sweet and not the best Marzipan around, it's like the sugar is all you can taste. If you like sweet things you might not find it so bad, but be advised that the Marzipan quality is far much inferior than Niederegger. I gave it 3 instead of 2 Stars for the fast shipping and good product appearance!

review/summary: Not what I was expecting
review/text: I was looking for something else completely, don't know how I ended up with this. First off the bottle is SO small. It is only like an inch, maybe an inch and a half tall. And the sparkles are not what I was expecting. It's hard to describe. I was looking for orange colored sugar, this is NOT it! What is also disappointing is there is not much there, you would have to have several bottles to decorate a cake or a doz cup cakes....<br />I knew I didn't want them from the moment I opened the box, but I sadly forgot to do anything about it until it was too late, now I am stuck with them. :(

review/summary: Good change
review/text: Simply Heinz Ketchup is the best ketchup with real sugar. No poisons like HFCS. I bought mine at costco and was pleased to see Heinz changed over to getting rid of HFCS. I can now buy ketchup again from costco.  The only thing better then this is organic .<br /><br />HFCS Here's why it's far more dangerous to your health than table sugar<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is a popular sweetener because it is chemically different from sugar ,it has a longer shelf life and mixes better into beverages. Yet the corn industry likes to downplay these differences, pointing out that sugar is 50 percent fructose and 50 percent glucose, while HFCS is 55 percent fructose and 45 percent glucose.<br /><br />This framing glosses over an essential difference: sugar (sucrose) is a disaccharide composed of a single glucose molecule and a single fructose molecule. HFCS, in contrast, is a liquid solution composed of separated individual glucose and fructose molecules (monosaccharides).<br /><br />To make HFCS, a 100 percent glucose solution is converted via enzymes into a 42 percent fructose-58 percent glucose solution. This solution is further treated until it is 90 percent glucose, then mixed with more 42-58 solution to yield a 55-45 concentration. So while the final ratio of fructose to glucose might look similar to table sugar, it is in fact a very different product. Is it any wonder that HFCS is processed differently by the body?

review/text: When I received the package about 1 week today, opened the package and saw 6 pack of Jans All Natural Juice 33.8 oz each container. There was one container that has very little leak because the box was little too big that caused the juice move too much. I tried the taste of the juice was pretty good good but I was very disappointed with the expiration date. It was overdue, September 22, 2012. Imagine that I ordered the juice on September 18th, 2012, and received on September 25, 2012 while someone packed overdue expiration date, September 22, 2012. It doesn't make any sense and all business is want is MONEY!! They might not care about customer's orders. I really have no idea WHY they did it. I have the right to give 1 out of 5 star for that kind of reason! I am a long time Amazon member. Wake up!!

review/summary: ~  Similarly Disappointed ~
review/text: As with Mr. Carlson's review, my order was also received damaged, no less than one container leaking badly & messing up all other containers up (had ordered 12 liters total). This most certainly is due to Amazon's continuing long-term practice of inadequate packing for shipping. Inflatable, lightweight, flimsy plastic bubbles packs for 3 gallons+ of juice with lots of "slop" packing-wise? Of course they will arrive damaged! In fairness though, the seals of the caps are very lightweight too.<br /><br />The expiration date on my juice was 2013, much better than Mr. Carson experienced. Have also appreciated the taste as well as the juice's truly amazing amount of vitamin C as well as the total price comparatively... but c'mon, Amazon! For years I've written to report damaged items from inadequate shipping practices, a few just this past year counting this shipment.<br /><br />So far as the Soursop fruit being 100 or even 10,000 times more effective than chemotherapy, my thought is that this is simply from the great amount of natural vitamin C available in the fruit/juice & may be nothing more than that. One liter of this juice contains about a half dozen times the FDA's suggested adult male's necessary intake of vitamin C (about 7 times of an adult female's needs) & this alone would likely be dozens of times more effective than taking dozens of times more of a synthetic vitamin C in pill form.<br /><br />Amazon simply must do better in packing this product for shipment as well as do much better packing many other items for shipment, though my honest opinion is that even if Amazon were to amp up their packing of this product that the flimsy outer seals on the containers may well not be adequate for shipping even then though they certainly must be better packed if Amazon has any hope of these arriving to customers undamaged. Thank you.<br /><br />~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~  ~<br /><br />Edit, weeks later: Ordered 2 more shipments of the same with worse results. One package did not so much as make it out of Nevada it was leaking so badly & undeliverable as a consequence. The other arrived as the last one had, except this time 2 of the 12 liters were leaking. Amazon used the very same totally inadequate large air bag packing in a box with lots of slop for the heavy liters of juice to crush & pop, resulting in the containers getting tossed around during transit. No wonder some leak. Not UPS friendly packing for shipment.<br /><br />Frustrating, having written the review, even directing Amazon to it as well as expressing myself thoroughly as has been done for the better part of a decade & Amazon has yet to change their packing system. Folks, the juice is very good, 4 of 5 stars. It's Amazon's continued predilection for lame packing of so many products over the years that is so unnecessary, in my estimation, 1 of 5 stars, that reduces this fine product to my rating of 2 of 5. Again, thank you.

review/summary: Truly much better than bullion!
review/text: I found this product in a gourmet grocery store, and since I like to make sauces, but don't have the time usually to do it from scratch, I tried it. I taste tested it against three different canned and boxed stocks I have used, and it was better. Depending on the concentration you mix it to, it is always chickeny, just a hint of sweet, and looks just like regular stock. I have even tried putting a quarts worth of the concentrate into a cupful of sauce and it doesn't make it salty, just taste richer, and it doesn't seem to affect the chemistry of sauces, thick or thin, no extra tendency to break. I have since tried all the other flavors with equal success. These are great for gourmet camp cooking too, and can be used any where you need a stock but don't want ot haul all the weight and bulk. Makes great soups too, friends and family rave about my Greek Avgolemeno soup which only uses this as the stock, along with some orzo, lemon, egg and diced cooked chicken.

review/summary: Savory Gravy Enhancer
review/text: If you love buying rotisserie chicken you can layer slices of chicken on fresh bread, then dip the sandwiches in a delicious homemade chicken gravy. The flavor of the gravy can be greatly enhanced by using this stock base. This chicken base also contains turmeric and soy protein.<br /><br />Better Than Bouillon is a stock paste or more like a chicken base than a bouillon cube. Dry bouillon cubes are famous for being overly salty and that is why chicken base is a much healthier, not to mention, tasty alternative.<br /><br />One teaspoon of bouillon blended into one cup of hot water makes one cup of chicken stock. I use two tablespoons butter and two tablespoons flour plus the stock and a sprinkling of poultry seasoning, freshly ground pepper and paprika. Melt the butter in a small saucepan, whisk in the flour and then the stock.<br /><br />The stock base is also perfect when you are making soups and one to two tablespoons is enough to flavor an entire pot of stock. You can also put the leftover rotisserie chicken in a stockpot, cover with water and simmer with vegetables and herbs/spices to make a delicious homemade stock. I love enhancing the stock with Better Than Bouillon and the possibilities are endless after you learn to make chicken stock and then use this product to enhance the flavor.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Terrible pricing!
review/text: This is an awesome product. I've used it for years and wouldn't make my soups with anything else--it is the closest thing to homemade stock that comes in a jar. I would even go so far as to say better than homemade because it makes a more flavorful broth than I can get from using two chickens. Having said all that, this pricing is awful. I buy BTB at my local grocery store (and most carry it now, although that wasn't always the case) for about 5.39. I came to Amazon hoping for a quantity break but no such luck. My advice is to check your own grocery stores first before you pay twice too much.

review/text: I used to depend on the powdered bouillon for cooking--or the little cubes.  No more.<br /><br />For chicken bouillon (or vegetable or beef), I now use this product. "Better than Bouillon" is much richer and has a far more textured and better taste.<br /><br />Something like this is often called for in recipes.  This is so much preferable to the cubes or powder that I would recommend to anyone using those to give it up. There is no comparison.<br /><br />Even better, of course, is using stock.  But for many people, that might not be an option.  Short of that, this product does well enough to work and is so much better than what I used before.

review/summary: Very Good Product
review/text: I've been using this product for quite a while now.  I order it online because, unfortunately, it isn't available for me to purchase locally.  It makes a really rich stock.  It's easy to use just the right amount to make what you need.  It's a thick paste so it's easy to measure.  It's a little difficult to get off the spoon, so measure it with one you can stir in the hot/boiling water with to get off all the paste.<br /><br />This is by far the best boullion/stock product I've ever used.  It tastes better than the dry cubes, dry powders and canned/packaged stock products.  There is less fat swimming on the top of your mixture than with the canned products as well.  It tastes as close to homemade stock as I've ever seen in a packaged product.  I've also used the beef as well and it is an equally good product.  It also does not taste as salty as the other products.

The beef is my least favorite because it's less versatile, but it's still delicious--it just goes poorly in rice and some other dishes I love.<br /><br />The things I make frequently with this are broth to drink straight on bad tummy or bad cold days, rice, and "easy noodle soup."  I like to either boil noodles and veggies with it or use hot water from the microwave or kuerig to make noodle and veggie soup. A little ginger and rosemary in the soups helps with a sick tummy, too! When I cook noodles this way it helps to use very thin ones or to drink off the first round of broth in the mug and pour a second bath of hot water over more bullion and the same noodles and veggies so they get enough time to cook.<br /><br />I always have one of these open and one in reserve--it's great for regular cooking, but never be caught sick without some on hand!<br /><br />I have yet to find a better stock, but I have to admit I quit looking once I found this stuff.

I found myself adding extra just to get any real flavor, and even then, there was no strong chicken taste. Didn't serve to heighten the flavors, or add aroma.<br />Given the high price (and the Amazon price is higher than in many stores), this isn't worth it. Knorr's very salty bouillon is still better.

I would buy soup stock only to use a few tablespoons to glaze my pans for cooking, and felt wasteful when the rest went bad.  I tried freezing into cubes, but found that to be time intensive and a storage problem.  So for years I used boullion cubes.<br />Now, my husband loves salt but wouldn't eat the grits I made because they were too salty. The only salt added was from the boullion.  Now the grits taste better, I can easily mix a pinch of soup base with water to  glaze a pan, and of course use it for gravy and soup base like most people.<br />This product costs less per serving than boullion, and doesn't have the storage problems of canned soup stock.  This base actually makes a better stock than most of the canned or carton stuff, anyway!<br />This has been a great addition to my regular panty staples.

review/summary: Best Stock I've Used
review/text: I live in Middle-of-freaking-nowhere Alaska and this product is the best.  It is easy to use, tastes awesome, and I can actually get it shipped to me.  Buying a box or can of liquid stock costs upwards of $10 (for the little one).  Bullion and powdered stocks are generally disgusting.  This product tastes excellent and makes my cooking easier, less expensive and better.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: It Is Better Than Bouillon - Highly Recommended
review/text: This "Better Than Bouillon" is my wife's secret weapon when making her signature Chicken and Pepper stir-fry. This is made from real meat stock and comes as a paste, which is much easier to work with than the bouillon cubes.<br /><br />This can be used anytime a chicken stock base is needed, but it can also be used in place of other spices when cooking. To bring out the the flavor of the chicken in stir-fry, the paste can be added directly to the meat while cooking and then, once the meat is browned, she adds the recommended amount of water. This makes the chicken flavor very pronounced and is one of our favorite quick dishes.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Better Than Bullion is the bomb!
review/text: Every other bullion I've ever seen lists salt as its first ingredient.  In the Better Than Bullion chicken base, "chicken meat" is the first ingredient listed.  In the BTB beef base, "roasted beef" is the first ingredient listed.<br /><br />Because these bases are so concentrated, they're quite salty, so you'll want to use them sparingly.  I usually eliminate or use very little other salt in whatever I'm making.  My Beer Beef Stew just wouldn't have quite the depth of meaty flavor without BTB beef base.  For an 8-quart pot of stew with 2 lbs. of cubed beef chuck roast and loads of veggies, I add a tablespoon of the base.<br /><br />And, I use BTB chicken base in almost every chicken recipe I make, especially my chicken gravy.  I'll be buying the BTB ham base next for my Ham and Beans recipe!<br /><br />These BTB products are very much a staple in my kitchen now.

review/summary: Makes a great soup
review/text: There is not much to say about it. I used this to make soup. It gives the soup a more natural taste and does taste pretty good. I bought this because it was organic made and the description said it was lower in sodium than the typical Boullion Cubes. For those watching their sodium intake this contains 680mg of sodium per serving. 1 tsp = a serving. The typical boullion cube is about 850mg. Its not a big difference but considering it taste better than boullion the lower sodium is a plus. They also make a reduce sodium version that has 500mg of sodium.<br /><br />Here are the Ingredients this contains:<br />Chicken Meat and Natural Juices*, Salt, Cane Sugar*, Maltodextrin*, Natural Flavor, Dried Onion*, Potato Starch*, Dried Garlic*, Turmeric* and Spice Extractives*.<br /><br />It does contain Maltodextrin but since this is made in the US the maltodextrin is derived from corn starch. So if you suffer from gluten intolerance you should be fine.<br /><br />You might be able to find it cheaper locally.

review/summary: Definitely worth it
review/text: I purchased this product at a local grocery store, initially drawn by it's lack of MSG (my husband is allergic). Having tried it over a year ago, I'm never going back to boxed/ canned broths or horrible bouillon cubes. Not only does it have a great shelf life in the fridge, but allows the user to easily adjust the flavor of whatever they are making depending on the amount of this product used.<br /><br />I was initially turned off by the price tag of the product, but the flavor, ease of use and storage, and comparable cost to boxed broth (this one little jar can make quite a bit), makes the price tag very reasonable (especially as unused portions of boxed broths would often go bad in the fridge before I could use them for another recipe). As a family of two with one on the way, this is now a go-to staple in our house.<br /><br />(P.S. Check out your local store before purchasing on this site. It's much cheaper at our store.)

review/summary: Lots of apricots... Few in sealed containers
review/text: The actual apricots are quite good despite an occasional apricot pit not being removed. Yes these apricots are untreated and brown in color!<br /><br />Basically the only problem is the packaging of the product is flimsy and the lids do not secure well. Beneath the lid is a very delicate seal, usually slightly raised with air. Secondly the individuals containers are placed into a divided cardboard box which is slightly too small. This is how I've never received a box that didn't have ruptured seals.  My 1st box arrived with 2 of 6 seals ruptured, the free 2nd box arrived with 4 of 6 ruptured. For all my hassle, I only ended up with exactly what I paid for, no more and no less.<br /><br />That being said, I still rate 4 out of 5 stars because I did eventually get what I paid for, and I do appreciate organic at this price.

I did not realize that organic meant they would be brown (silly me I thought the package was green  like the top and that was why the picture made them look brown).  These taste more like raisins than the dried apricots I am used to.  I have been trying to like them and I like most organic things I have tried but this product makes me realize why preservatives are used.  I am going back to the pretty orange ones that taste like apricots because these taste spoiled to me.  It may be an acquired taste...

review/summary: Great Idea, BAD Marketing
review/text: I read most of the reviews (especially the negative ones) about this product before purchasing and knew of the possibility that this particular model may not fit the brand of natural PB my wife likes (16 oz Natural Organic PB from Trader Joe's in a plastic jar).  I decided to get it because there was a decent chance it would fit.  Without opening the package, I could tell it wouldn't fit.  This could have easily been avoided if the specs were included in the product details.<br /><br />Anyone purchasing this or similar models should know that there are 6 DIFFERENT MODELS TO CHOOSE FROM:<br /><br />#100 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 77mm lid<br />#200 -- twist knob mixer for 16 oz reduced fat jar with 77mm lid<br />#300 -- crank mixer for 16 oz jar with 70mm lid<br />#400 -- crank mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#500 -- twist knob mixer for 26 oz jar with 83mm lid<br />#600 -- twist knob mixer for 36 oz jar with 99mm lid<br /><br />The product considered in this review refers to Model #100.  Those of you who want it to fit on the Trader Joe's PB that I mentioned earlier will need to get Model #300.<br /><br />As I said in the subject, this product looks like a great idea, but the marketing lacks an important fact (which I find unnecessarily deceptive) so I am giving it a sub-par rating.  It does NOT take much effort to list these very important specs that would help people buy precisely what they need, especially when this info is contained on the back of the product itself.<br /><br />I found the #300 model on another site and am purchasing it separately.  I'm also returning the one I got here.<br /><br />If you're going to get this product, pull out a ruler or measuring tape and measure your lid to ensure you get the right fitting model.  Thanks for reading.

review/text: REMEMBER THE OLD WAY OF STIRRING PEANUT BUTTER?<br /><br />I think you've all experienced trying to stir a fresh jar of viscous separated peanut butter before. You stick a knife in and stir and stir and stir. In about a minute your hand starts to cramp so you try to use more of your arm. That's when you get clumsy and the oil starts to spill over the sides. The jar gets slippery making it difficult to grab onto its side; plus you've left a mess on the countertop. 10 minutes later you're still stuck with big clumps of peanut and a pool of sludge on the top.<br /><br />THE NEW WAY:<br /><br />This gadget eliminates the mess and gets the job done in about 5 minutes.<br /><br />SOME TIPS:<br /><br />- Place the jar on a oven mit when stirring so that it doesn't slip.<br /><br />- After the peanut butter is mixed (and of course after you've taken the stirrer+lid out) just store it in the fridge to prevent separation. To use the peanut butter just nuke in microwave  (without the lid of course) for about 30 seconds.<br /><br />- If you typically buy the larger peanut butter jars, go to Witmer's web site and order the larger stirrer. The deluxe kit comes with lids of both sizes.

review/text: Unless you are buying your peanut butter fresh ground in the little plastic tubs or some smaller brand, you probably get one of the Smucker's/Laura Scudder's jar from your super market. This fits those perfectly and greatly simplifies/enhances the mixing experience. It does a much better job than I had with a butter knife or a plastic chopstick, not to mention the mess it avoids. I would even say it made the peanut butter taste better since the consistency throughout the jar was more even from the mixing. To store and protect the device, I just saved one of the empty jars and keep it on there in the cupboard. That way, too, my wife will remember what it's for and not toss it in the next garage sale. ;-)

review/text: The item rates 5 stars... it does a great job of mixing and I am very happy with it.  However, the supplied lid size was too big to fit 16 oz Trader Joe's peanut butter jars and required a relatively easy modification before we could use it.  I drilled a hole in the center of a TJ lid (plastic) and then threaded the rod portion of the mixer through the hole.  Works fine now, with the supplied metal lid resting on top of the plastic lid for stability.  MIXERS TO FIT DIFFERENT LID SIZES ARE AVAILABLE from the manufacturer, so you might want to check that out first.

review/summary: Gives you a tidy head start in mixing natural peanut butter
review/text: Those who enjoy natural (that is, non-hydrogenated) peanut butter know that a new jar will present itself with the peanut oil mostly separated from the ground peanuts. Getting the two mixed together, with a knife or chopsticks, can be a messy affair, with peanut oil slopping over the side of the jar. The solution is Witmer's peanut butter mixer. This item is comprised of a metal screw-on lid that fits standard 16 oz. jars (e.g., Adams, Laura Scudder, Smuckers), and an arc-shaped stirring rod-and-handle that fits through a small hole in the lid. You simply screw the lid onto your new jar, insert the stirring rod through the hole and turn the handle a few times. The result is not always completely mixed (especially for crunchy peanut butters), but it's sufficiently started to finish up with a knife - about the same work as re-stirring after you've let a jar sit for a day or two. Clean up is a breeze: a rubber gasket on the lid's hole cleans the stirring rod as it's removed from the jar, and a polypropylene insert inside the lid pops out for easy washing. Amazon lists only the standard model (the #100) for 16 oz. jars that are 4.75 inches high and have a 3 inch diameter lid. Additional models for reduced fat, small mouth, 26 oz., 36 oz., 60 oz., and no salt jars are also available from the manufacturer. Replacement parts can also be purchased separately.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: My review is 'don't bother.'<br /><br />I put this on my wish list after seeing it on (I think) the 'Cool Tools' website. I wish I would have read Joseph Rukaj's review so I would not have received the 'almost right' size as I prefer the Trader Joe's PB. Regardless, I have sufficient hand strength to hold it securely during use but, I still need to finish mixing the PB with a knife, spoon, spatula, whatever, like before because the peanut butter is merely 'stirred,' not really mixed.<br /><br />What use is a tool that requires you to finish the job with the tool you bought the first tool to replace? Clever doesn't count for much if it doesn't solve the problem. I'd return it if I could.

review/summary: No vertical, all horizontal
review/text: This gadget is a great idea, and it does indeed avoid most of the mess associated with plain-ground-peanuts peanut butter.  It's also made in USA, a rarity these days.<br /><br />I just wish it worked.<br /><br />I tried it a few times.  Durned if I can figure out how all these folks writing glowing reviews are using it.  No matter how long I crank it, the best I can get is runny, oily PB at the top and thick, unspreadable-when-cold PB at the bottom.<br /><br />The problem is that on the store shelf (or mine), the oil floats to the top of the jar, and the peanut mass sinks to the bottom.  However, the mixing rod just stirs the PB round and round.  There's nothing on this mixer to mix the stuff vertically, nothing to pull the peanuts up and/or push the oil down.<br /><br />It needs something like what my old electric-drill paint mixer has - vanes at a 45 degree angle that turn the cranking into forces that act vertically.  Of course that would make it harder to clean, but at least it would work.<br /><br />I've gone back to the old method.  I dump the jar's contents into a large bowl, mix it up (using that vertical folding motion!) with a big old wooden spoon, then glop it back into the jar.

review/text: works perfect with the Smuckers 16 oz bottle.  As usual, my wife sniffed at it, but even she commented later that it worked superbly.  I almost fell over that she agreed with me.  Honestly, this is an immense improvement over using a spoon to stir up the natural peanut butter.  Easy to clean because the stirrer is a bent prong that fits neatly in the bottle, and not some type of beater attachment.  Buy it, it's worth the money over having to stir over and over again!!

review/text: This peanut butter mixer works great - I have used it on both Smuckers and MaraNatha organic peanut butter.  I think it would work on OnceAgain nut butter jars too.  Not only does it make stirring peanut butter more fun, but it prevents you from spilling the oil over the sides of the jar.  I used to dump the contents of a new jar in a mixing bowl to stir it before returning it to the jar just to avoid the mess.  But this does the trick right in the jar!  Also a great gift for other nut butter lovers :)

Usually you can get the same thing done without the extra clutter. But this tool sold me. If you are the one who has usually had to deal with stirring each newly opened jar of natural peanut butter, this is for you! No more mess - seriously! And it's ridiculously easy. Swap the cover for this one, slip in the stirrer, and turn a few times. That's it. Then swap the covers back. Nicely mixed peanut butter. Best purchase I've made in ages.

review/summary: Peanut Butter Mixer
review/text: The peanut butter mixer is a good product, especially for those that don't want partially hydrogenated oils, palm oil and trans fats that the manufacturers stir into their peanut butter to keep the peanut oil from separating.  This peanut butter mixer makes it a lot easier to get started to stir up your peanut butter.  You don't have to get the oil all over the place when you first start stirring and it is a lot easier to turn a crank instead of sticking a fork, spoon or knife in and trying to turn that in the hard peanut butter.  The small thin stirrer rod did manage to break up the hard peanut butter and get the oil incorporated into it.  After stirring it for quite some time, the rod could not get out all of the lumps.  I had to go back in the jar with a flat knife, like a butter knife, and stir some more to get it to the consistency that I like, but the peanut butter mixer made the hard job of stirring a whole lot easier.  I am recommending it because I am glad that I bought it and I like it a lot.

review/text: Bought this Witmer Company Peanut Butter Mixer, Model 100 back in 2009, and now that I have over three years experience with it, I have a few observations.<br /><br />First I have have used it exclusively with Smuckers Natural Peanut Butter, both creamy and chunky. As far as the curved mixing part that fts inside the jar, it does a pretty good job. My real complaint is with the white rubber washer that fits inside the lid. After about a year it dislodged and does not function as it was intended. After mixing, it floats on top of the newly mixed peanut butter. Actually, it is a bit easier to clean but that is not the way it is supposed to work. The cranking handle works exactly like a cranking handle should work.<br /><br />One other thing that help this work better is to turn your jars of peanut butter upside down for about two weeks before you do any mixing. It helps to distribute the oil and makes the mixing much easier and certainly more uniform.

review/text: I ordered the model #100, but received the #300, instead. I kept it, since it fits the Trader Joe's peanut butter I sometimes buy. But now I don't want to risk placing another order, fearing that I won't get the correct item. It's a shame, since we really love this gadget (hence the 5 star review). The best way to package it would be one stirrer with 2 or 3 lids, but I can't find any such combo on Amazon.

review/summary: Going strong after 10 years!
review/text: We have had our peanut butter stirrer for probably around 10 years now, and it still works great!  Smuckers gave them away free as a promotion for their natural peanut butter back then, and we've been using it ever since.  I do wish it was a little longer though because it doesn't reach the bottom of the jar (although the one in the picture looks a little less curved than mine, so maybe it does now), and it would be nice if it locked into the lid somehow because it can be a bit wobbly when you really get cranking, but I still give it 5 stars because it has prevented a lot of messes (spilled oil is no fun!) and held up beautifully over the years! I definitely recommend it!

review/summary: Works as Promised
review/text: Easy to use, just be careful you don't by jars with odd sized tops.  Does what is says it will & definitely works easier & neater than trying to mix a jar with a fork or knife...if your peanut butter comes separated from the store you should own this thing

review/summary: Great product! No more messy, chunky unspreadable PB
review/text: I really like this product. I love natural PB but have always hated the mess and annoyance of having to mix it up with a knife. I just leave this in the jar, give a quick swirl when needed and spread away. Awesome! I'm buying another for my mom.

review/summary: Love this mixer!
review/text: What a great invention!  We keep the mixer in/on the jar and give it a few churns before opening and spreading.  Love the bladder in the middle of the top that allows the mixer to be removed cleanly!...FABULOUS IDEA for us health nuts (no pun intended!)

review/summary: I wish I had invented this gadget
review/text: I love natural peanut butter and use it in recipes like African Peanut Sweet Potato Bisque [...], pb&j sandwiches, and on top of chocolate cupcakes.  Because natural peanut butter always separates, and because I am not overly strong and quite messy, this frequent use turned into a frequent mess as I struggled to mix the peanut butter without spilling the oil or ending up with a hard lump in the bottom of the jar I had to hack out with my paring knife.  This sweet little invention made everything so easy.  Even I could thoroughly mix my peanut butter without difficulty, mess, or excessive muscle use.  And I am nearly halfway through the first "witmer-ized" jar, and keep marveling at the creamy consistency the whole way through.  I think this is what the stuff was supposed to be like all along!  I'm just kicking myself for not inventing this tool when I had envisioned something almost identical to this years ago when I struggled to mix my second jar of peanut butter.  I could be making money off of this!

review/summary: Works but just ok
review/text: I sent this as a gift to someone who eats a lot of natural peanut butter. The feedback I got was that this product does work but so does a spoon.
