review/text: My daughter will not drink white milk at preschool, so I send this for her for her lunch.  She likes it and it is very convenient.  Kept it in the diaper bag when she was little.  Great for on the go and travel.  Amazon is PRICEY though.  I can get this at BJ Wholesale Club for around $13 for 18 pk year round.

review/summary: Horizon Milk RULES!
review/text: I buy these little Horizon milks for my kids, though I drink them too.  I get them on the subscription plan (which you really should do, it saves money, and it keeps a steady stream of milk coming for your kids).  Try every flavor, they are all great:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVB52">Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKZ3GA">Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, Chocolate, 8-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 18)</a> (the best chocolate milk, ever, not gross and thick like grocery store chocolate milk), and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVB52">Horizon Organic Reduced Fat Milk, 8-Ounce Packages (Pack of 18)</a>.  And also let me add a shameless plug for the beta version of the subscription program:  I LOVE IT!

review/summary: is it really organic?
review/text: Organics consumers should know that Horizon is owned by Dean Foods, at $10 billion of annual sales and controlling about 50 different dairy brands in the country, the largest dairy processor/marketer in the United States.<br /><br />A large percentage of their milk comes from their corporate industrial-scale dairy, with 8000 animals, in the desert-like environment of central Idaho.  They say that 80% of their milk comes from "family farmers" but some of those "farmers" are also milking thousands of animals.<br /><br />There are serious questions as to whether or not these farms are meeting both the letter and spirit of the organic law.

review/summary: BLECH! Honestly cannot stand these now.new formula.
review/text: my parents had been buying these from Costco since I was in 6th grade(just now graduated high school ) they were really delicious and we would go through the crates quickly.<br /><br />About two or 3 years ago, I noticed new packaging and a horrible new taste,it was like they watered it Down.We couldn't even finish the rest of the case and were really disappointed to learn that they changed the formula.we never bought another one.<br /><br />Maybe it is less sugar,but that's what I liked and will not be purchasing again.<br />I also remember them being pretty expensive for cased milk , it was worth It then but not now.

review/summary: Great While Traveling with Toddler
review/text: First off, We travel a lot with out Toddler. We live over 40 from a gas station and 160 from a grocery store or big box store. We only serve organic milk to our daughter and have found these to be invaluable for our needs. This is not her everyday milk, nor would I recommend it to be due to the sugar content. But it serves as a great traveling milk and a back up when we run out of regular milk. Or as a special snack. (Our very small local store and gas station do not carry organic products) My Daughter loves the taste. I love that it is shipped to my door for free and a competitive price. I have found all of the Horizon Products to be delicious and good quality.

review/text: As I stated with the Strawberry, this is a very healthy and quality drink.  I give these to my 4 yr old Grandson (about 2 per day) and he loves them.  Strawberry seems to be his favorite currently but he likes vanilla also.  It must be good if it is organic, healthy, and the FAVORITE drink for a 4 yr old yes?  By the case is much more cost effective.  BTW, these do not need refrigeration for storage, but I always keep 6-10 chilled for my Grandson....

review/summary: Horizon always good milk... priced a little high
review/text: Horizon can always be counted on to supply good/great milk products. And from what I have heard about how they treat their animals, it sounds like they do their part for the health and well-being of the animal and the environment. I do have two legitimate gripes with my purchase though... first, the price is a bit higher than it need be... but OK, I could have chosen not to order... secondly, the expiration date is not far off enough for this to truly provide you with a "back-up" source of milk on hand. My batch is only good for 4 months. Of course I can use it within 4 months but that wasn't necessarily the idea. It was more intended to provide a "red cross pantry" type product for when we unexpectedly ran out or could not get to the store, etc. So I *REALLY* wish they would extend the shelf life on the product they are shipping. This is not the first time it has happened. It happens on each order I have placed. If Amazon and Horizon could collaborate and get a much more extended shelf life... this would be even be worth the extra cost just to have the peace of mind. But they really need to work on that aspect. Enjoy your milk!

review/summary: Pricey but worth it
review/text: We always buy organic/no hormone milk for our girls. My preschooler fell in love with these milks from Starbucks, so I started buying them in bulk for her to have at home. Like another mom mentioned, she would get a tummyache if she drank a whole box in one sitting (maybe just too much milk at once or maybe due to the high sugar content?), so I started giving her a glass of half this milk and half regular milk: no more tummyaches! Now our toddler is drinking the same mix and loves it, too. Due to the expense, especially with two kids drinking them all day every day, I will be cutting them about 2/3's regular milk + 1/3 vanilla Horizon milk.

review/summary: Love These Little Guys
review/text: As I have said in other reviews, I enjoy eating healthier yet have little time to eat at work. I have been trying to move myself away from fattier, oily snacks during my day and sugary sweet drinks to wash them down. I thought Sun-Chips were pretty good, and buying chocolate milk from the Cafeteria filled it in. I wanted to do better, though. I have now been drinking a lot of Vita Coco to help fill the void, but it can be so expensive and sources which are decently-priced are endangered. This was a questionable purchase at first, since I have been drinking skim milk for 15 years now, so I am used to and prefer the cold, crisp, lighter flavor. I am glad I went for it!<br />Pros<br />-Love the packaging! Does seem to keep flavor better than traditional small milk cartons.<br />-Smooth and rich flavoring. Chocolate is richer in flavor than vanilla. My wife says the vanilla has an after-taste, but I disagree. So it is apparently subjective. I have yet to try the strawberry, but if I were a betting man, I would say the same is true for it.<br />-Better sugar and fat contents than generic milk packages. I have read other reviews that criticize this, but I am not sure what they have been drinking instead. All regular milk has sugar. It is really not that much.<br /><br />Cons<br />-You might be of those who think the sugar content is too high.<br />-The flavor is different than any I had had before. Any new flavor can be a tough adjustment. Sometimes, that adjustment never completes (I think this one is worth it, but I adjusted very quickly).

review/summary: Love it! And cheaper than smaller packs at Target!
review/text: My daughter had some trouble adjusting to regular milk unless we mixed the whole milk with this! Halfing it or 2/3 whole to 1/3 Horizon helped her start drinking milk! At other places, a pack of 3 was about $3 so finding a larger package and being able to use some discounts on Amazon made it less pricy considering how much we use. If Horizon made a whole milk version that would be nice but for now mixing gives her both what she needs and what she likes.

review/summary: New formula is not good
review/text: This has long been the only milk my 4 year old would ever drink. We had been buying it on subscribe and save for a few years now. Our last shipment had the new formula and my daughter took one sip and said "yuck!" She won't even touch it now and I have a whole case of milk that she won't drink.  Such a disappointment. I have to say that although the old formula had 1% more fat and a few extra grams of sugar I don't think the minor nutritional improvements are worth the sacrifice in flavor.  I tasted as well and the new formula does have a chalky taste to it. Bring back the old formula!!

review/summary: Beware! The Formula has Changed
review/text: My kids have been drinking this milk for years in their lunches and loved it. We bought it by the 18-pack in both chocolate and vanilla.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most recent shipment was flatly refused by my kids who are not horribly picky. They wanted me to throw 2 cases out!<br /><br />The worse news is that after checking with Horizon Dairy to see if we got a bad batch, we found out they CHANGED THE FORMULA! After confirming our UPC numbers, etc. this is the response we received in March of 2011:<br /><br />"Thank you for your recent e-mail to Horizon Organic�. We appreciate your interest in our products.<br /><br />We tested the new versions of Horizon Organic 1% Flavored Milks thoroughly and received strong consumer results, specifically related to the improvement over our prior formulas.<br /><br />While we've received positive feedback, we're sorry you're not completely satisfied with our new recipe changes.<br /><br />We value you as a consumer and hope we can help you find another Horizon Organic product to meet your needs.<br /><br />Thanks again for contacting the Consumer Affairs Department."<br /><br />What's worse is after asking for a refund from Horizon Dairy, on the 18th of March I was told Amazon doesn't buy directly so I have to ask Amazon instead.  Took over a month to get a definitive answer.  Now hopefully Amazon can still help us!<br /><br />Buyer beware!<br /><br />Regards,<br />KAM

It has a nice light vanilla flavor - not too strong.

We can stick a box in her diaper/snack/toy bag when we go somewhere and it's ready when she wants it. She seems to feel that it's fine at room temperature.  Amazon's price is good (on sale, this is usually $1 a box). This last time that I ordered it, it came two days later. If this is a product that you use a lot, I can definitly recommend buying it through Amazon.

review/text: My 14 month old would NOT drink milk.  Anytime I tried, he would gag...and sometimes even throw up.  He is a breastfed baby, so I believe that turned him off to the very UN-sweet taste of regular milk.  I tried mixing chocolate, strawberry....tried regular milk (although I am happy he did not like that because I would rather he drink organic!), organic, soy....everything!  Stumbled upon these little cartons and figured I would give it a shot.  He LOVES it.  It is the ONLY milk he will drink - maybe it is as close to breast milk as it gets?  I am slowly mixing the regular Horizon Organic milk, we will see what happens!

review/text: My daughter has loved Horizon's organic milk boxes for several years, so I was excited to find them in cases through Amazon and ordered vanilla and chocolate. Both arrived promptly, yet I was greatly disappointed that the vanilla case had a Jan. 2011 expiration while the chocolate had one for June 2011. The vanilla had obviously been "aging" in a warehouse.<br /><br />I have these on a bi-monthly subscription service, so I'm hoping the next delivery in November has fresher vanilla product. And if not, I'll have to find a source elsewhere.

While it seems to be mostly marketed as a children's drink, we use it as a drink mixer with amaretto and it is wonderful.  It was a great improvement to regular amaretto and milk.  I'm sure it would be wonderful to substitute for regular milk in baking or in egg creams.  The expiration on our last case was about 3-4 months, so it lasts a lot longer than regular milk.

review/summary: Good Product, Terrible Price!
review/text: My five year old loves this milk and the fact that it is shelf stable means that I can pack it in his school snacks and not worry about it spoiling...very handy.<br /><br />BUT, Amazon's price is HORRIBLE.  What a way to take advantage of people who might live in remote areas without a retail outlet.  I buy this at BJ's for $12.79 for a case of 18 and can even get it at Whole Foods (you know, of the "Whole Paycheck" joke) for $14.99.<br /><br />They do have the strawberry milk here, which I've never seen at a retail store, but, fortunately, my son doesn't like it.  I did buy it on "sale" for closer to the usual retail price.

review/summary: My daughter's favorite!
review/text: My 6-year-old is allergic to every artificial food coloring.  This sometimes makes it difficult to find interesting things to add to her lunches.  She absolutely loves this line of milk.  The vanilla is her favorite, strawberry 2nd favorite and chocolate comes in last.  She says that she would much rather take this in her lunch than a juice box or Capri Sun.  Works for me!  The flavors are light not overwhelmingly strong.

review/text: I love all the Horizon milk - but this one.  I won't give a bad rating because it's just my personal taste. It's a bit too sweet, but not in a good way.  I'm not really tasting the vanilla flavor.  But amazon should really be ashamed of what they are charging for this.  They seem to have raised the price AGAIN in the last couple of weeks.  Just a while ago it was just 21 dollars.  That is too high, but 25?  I love the milk, but I refuse to buy it at that price.

review/summary: Great way to get kiddos to drink milk...
review/text: My 21 month old son doesn't really like to drink milk, but would always slurp these down when I got them for him at Starbucks. He only seemed to like the vanilla flavor though. I live in a fairly rural part of the country, and the only store that carried these only carries the 3 packs, and doesn't carry the  vanilla flavor. So I went online! I picked these up when Amazon was running the Horizon/Silk milk box promotions, and got a HUGE deal on them, I am very satisfied. I stocked up for now, but when the next promotion rolls around I will be ordering more!

review/summary: Beware of carrageenan ingredient
review/text: My 2 year old loves this milk, drinking at least 1 per day for the past 2-3 weeks.  He began having digestive issues and complaining of belly aches, so I googled the ingredient listed as carrageenan.  It's a "natural" thickening agent used in soy milk and other organic products that causes many people to experience the same symptoms my son has experienced.  In fact, many people who drink certain brands of soy milk containing carrageenan mistakenly attribute their digestive problems to the soy, when it's actually the carrageenan.<br /><br />IS CARRAGEENAN REALLY NATURAL?<br /><br />Carrageenan is about as wholesome as monosodium<br />glutamate (MSG), which is extracted from rice, and can<br />equally be considered natural. Aspartame (NutraPoison)<br />is also natural, as it is extracted from decayed plant<br />matter that has been underground for millions of years<br />(oil). So too are many other substances such as<br />carrageenan that can also be classified by FDA and<br />USDA as wholesome and natural food additives.<br /><br />Just because something comes from a natural source<br />does not mean that it is safe.<br /><br />Organic?  What a joke. Horizon and the conglomerate that owns this factory farm should be ashamed of themselves.

review/summary: Appears to be generic product, poor quality, no labeling
review/text: I have purchased Bassett's licorice all-sorts before from Amazon, but perhaps not the same size bag; those previous orders were excellent. However, I recently ordered two of the 5 pound bags allegedly from Bassett's.  They arrived in two unlabeled plastic bags--no brand name, no "nutrition info," no list of ingredients--absolutely nothing.  Nor was there a packing slip. The packing materials for the product were two empty, slightly padded priority envelopes that were empty. One one on top of the candy packages, the other on the bottom. I opened one bag of candy and tried a few pieces. They aren't fresh and don't have the usual Bassett's quality.  Instead, they look like generic candy sold in bulk. I've no way of knowing if Bassett's is in any way connected with this candy. I can't be sure what is in them because there is no labeling whatsoever. If indeed these are Bassett's candies, the bags should have the logo on them; there should be ingredients lists; there should be a packing slip! Don't buy from Cherryfield Candy. It looks like they operate out of someone's basement.

review/text: Very low quality. Candy arrived in a plain, transparent plastic bag with no markings except stock number.  No country of origin, no brand name, no ingredient list, no description, no dates, nothing !  The black licorice (I really doubt it is licorice) tasted disgusting with an after taste that lasted for an hour.  The colored pieces were all smeared with the black licorice making the entire mess very unappealing looking.  The black pieces were also stuck together in clumps. I've had good licorice and bad - this is the worse I've ever had the misfortune of trying.  It was supposed to be Bassett's brand, a decent product, I can't believe it really is.  Also, another reviewer mentioned it looked like floor sweepings, I think they are right.<br /><br />One final question:  How can a 5 lb bag of candy have a shipping weight of 4.6 lbs ?

This company replaced damaged product without my asking, in fact I said they didn't have to because someone signed for the original damaged product and that is our fault .

review/text: I ordered this because I love the allstate and it hard I find them.  The product came in an open bag and was not real fresh.  Not horrible but was not as fresh as I would expect.  The pricing was good otherwise.

review/summary: A little Stale!?
review/text: I was diappointed by this product for two reasons. First, it was kind of stale, not as fresh as the individual packages. Second, and I may be wrong, but it didn't seem like it was the same quality as the regular Bassett's!? I'll eat it, but I will buy the smaller packages next time.

review/summary: My favourite
review/text: I have been eating Licorice Allsorts since I was a little girl growing up in England. I loved them then and I love them still. So happy that I can order easily on line in 5 lb bags. The package arrived in short order and, as expected, the contents were delicious. I took another reviewer's advise and separated the contents into smaller bags to freeze. That makes it a little easier to ration them out to myself; otherwise, I would probably be constantly popping one in my mouth and 5 lbs would be gone in no time.

review/summary: Most affordable monofloral raw honey I've found anywhere; has health benefits
review/text: I truly searched for affordable monofloral raw honey.  White Gold is the least expensive one I've found, taking into consideration Amazon's free shipping for this product - barely over .51 � per ounce.  I've already placed several orders for it, not only for myself but as gifts, because it's a real treat.  It's over 40% more expensive at my local Whole F**ds.<br /><br />White Gold, owned by Continental Systems, is real raw honey. I've talked with the company representative on more than one occasion.  First, they don't heat this honey whatsoever - it is cold packed.  It's raw.<br /><br />Wikipedia defines RAW HONEY as honey that is exists without adding heat above 120 �F.  Wikipedia goes on to state: "Local raw honey is sought after by allergy sufferers as the pollen impurities are thought to lessen the sensitivity to hay fever."  White Gold is not heated at all.<br /><br />Monofloral honey is somewhat hard to find and always has a distinctive flavor since it comes from one plant species' nectar.  Monofloral clover honey is pale white, but a lot of polyfloral honeys are labeled as clover honey for the retail trade.  There are many different types of monofloral honeys so you can experiment and find out which is your favorite. Keep in mind that heat processing darkens (browns) honey.<br /><br />Further, White Gold is hand-packed and not whipped (aka, creamed).  That's significant because honey manufacturers often whip honey to make it more spreadable, but White Gold is already highly spreadable without this extra processing.<br /><br />White Gold is a logical beginning when you are trying to discover your favorite raw monofloral honey.  It has a unique fragrance that will probably be totally unfamiliar to you.  You'll probably like it very much right from the start and recognize the clover taste.<br /><br />In my opinion, the comparison of this raw pure clover honey to pasteurized standard table honey labeled clover is akin to comparing Grade A maple syrup to Grade B maple syrup.  And then in addition, one must consider that raw honey has health benefits that pasteurized honey completely lacks.

review/summary: Too Mild !
review/text: If you want spreadable honey, this is it!  Very mild and spreadable on toast and breads.  This is actually too mild for our family; we prefer a much stronger, intense and flowery smell.  Since this is a matter of personal taste, I can only give this a 3 star.  For side by side comparison with comparable priced products, I'd much prefer certified organic raw honey from YS Organic Bee Farms or Wholesome Sweeteners.  If you add this honey in tea or water, it doesn't have that distinctive honey smell, just sugary water.

review/text: This honey is great tasting, which is not too unusual; what sets it apart is the consistency. It's thicker and not as runny as most honeys, so it's easier to serve without making a big mess. With most honeys you leave a trail between the jar and the destination, but the White Gold honey comes out clean, without dripping everywhere.

review/summary: White Gold Honey is a Great but where's the honey?
review/text: Well after some hours on the internet looking for a truly RAW honey I stumbled on this and decided why not give it a try.<br />After receiving it in the mail I realized that 23oz wasn't much at all, but I guess that's the price you pay for unheated, untreated honey these days.<br />With my first spoonful it was quite clear that this was honey was well above par. Consistency is great, not runny but not stone hard either; texture is smooth & soft, and taste is very unique for a honey. It tastes more like candy to me then actual honey. Very sweet, mild tasting. For some this may sit well but for me I was looking for something more "earthy," more "organic."<br /><br />Bottomline: An excellent honey if you are interested in something RAW, SWEET tasting, & very MILDLY aromatic, but other then that I would recommend to others.<br /><br />Update: I recently picked up Stakich's Manuka Honey and I must say it's really a spectacular tasting honey, exactly the taste I was looking for, although the consistency was a bit more runny then I wanted. After trying out over six different honey types & brands this is my favorite by far.

review/summary: Heavenly Honey!
review/text: Oh my word! is all I can say about this honey! A while back, I tried some white creamy raw honey that my sister had that was so uncomparable to any honey I had ever had. I had to have some, but when I found out how much she paid for it, $32 for 32 oz., I decided to try and find something similar elsewhere. Searched all over online and this was the closest looking thing to it. Got it in the mail and found out it is exactly like the other expensive stuff I had tried! I have truely found the most perfect honey!!! You will be so happy. Even my husband who could care less about this stuff eats it like candy. He had an upset stomach one night and I told him to eat a couple tablespoons of it, he did (well maybe more because he couldn't stop munching on it) and his stomach ache went away in about a half hour. It's just plain heavenly and consistency is just like the picture. Spreads beautifully. Please Amazon, never stop selling this!

review/text: The website for this product calls it "The world's best tasting honey." I believe they have every right to claim that title. This does not taste like honey, nor like sugar. It is a light, mild, nectary, delicious substance unlike anything you're likely to have tasted often before, if ever. Mixed into herbal teas, it enhances the flavors and makes them sparkle. Absolutely a necessity for the tea addict or anyone who prefers natural sweeteners over processed sugars.

However, I'm not sure if it's the honey or maybe just a placebo affect, but I seem to have more energy when I use this honey than when I use store bought. I drink at least a pot or two of coffee a day and I always use honey in my coffee, this actually seems to give me a noticeable, though small, boost of energy throughout the day; and I don't feel AS tired. One thing though that does irk me is the small amount for such a high price, I wouldn't hesitate to use a subscribe and save if it was offered, because I really do enjoy this brand. BTW this type of honey is wonderful for toast, it has such a thick consistency and creamy texture when spread that I don't know how I'll use store bought ever again.

review/summary: Best Dang Honey I've Every Eaten
review/text: White Gold Raw Unfiltered Honey is wonderful.<br /><br />I've always loved honey...believed that the honey I purchased was just that...HONEY.  Ignorance is bliss...eh?  I've been really dismayed to discover that some of the honey (the processed/filtered/clear kind) out there is adulterated with HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP (HFCS).  I HATE this stuff.  How would I or you know?  We can't...it's an impossibility...and that's exactly how HFCS manufacturers want to keep it.  If HFCS listed as an ingredient on any product I pick up at the grocery store I place it back on the shelf and walk away.  I'm sure that's EXACTLY why corn producers and HFCS manufacturers do not want regulations that require it being listed in the ingredients on products that contain HFCS...if we only knew.  Sadly, some bee farmers use HFCS to supplement their bees diets...could this be part of the cause for bee colony collapse?  I wonder.<br /><br />I'm stepping off my soapbox now and want you to know that this White Gold Raw/Unfiltered Honey is absolutely the best honey I've ever tasted.  It's mild, buttery, and aromatic all at the same time.  It just melts in your mouth and has a clean, yummy aftertaste.

review/summary: This honey has a delicious, mild clover flavor.
review/text: I've tried the YS brand raw honey/royal jelly gel. That was very soft, reminding me texture-wise of the inside of a Cadbury egg. This is my second foray into raw honeys. This was pure white, separated in places with more of a crystalline texture while staying close to that Cadbury egg consistency. The flavor was less overwhelmingly sweet like other honeys that I've tried. I like it, and for the value of two containers plus free super saver shipping I'm going to reorder when I'm out. My mother hates honey spoonfuls but this mild clover honey was enough to sway her aversion to the beneficial sweet stuff. Raw honey has a load of health benefits (enjoyed in moderation of course!) and this is monofloral which is another great attribute.

I corresponded with the folks who make it in Canada because I had a question about it not being very dark and I understood that the darker the honey the more nutritious it is.  Well, I was wrong to some degree and it seems that this color is just the result of the flowers used in that pristine area of Canada.  The producers were very responsive and and friendly.<br /><br />Just an awesome honey, the best I have ever tasted.
