I could eat a whole bag myself!!<br /><br />GET THEM!!! THEY ARE SOOOO GOOD!

review/summary: Ranch isn't only good with tortilla chips....
review/text: I have been a longtime fan of Kettle Potato Chips, since I was a small child. The terrific texture and "crunch" of their product never leaves me disappointed - what's more, the high quality ingredients that go into the top-of-the-line flavors they have are first rate. Zesty Ranch does not fail to disappoint me. The Ranch flavor has a terrific, zippy quality (like the flavor name would suggest). It livens up your taste buds, and I am pleased to say that it isn't too salty, nor too greasy. Each chip is packed to it peak with flavor, and it is far from skimped upon. You almost don't need any dip or sauce of any kind on this snack. It speaks for itself. Highly recommended. Makes me want to go crunch on some right now!

review/summary: Most of the Bags were open
review/text: I've eaten these Krinkle Cut Salt and Pepper Chips for years.  I was very excited to find them on Amazon.  I bought the 24 pack specifically so they would be fresh every time I opened them (opposed to buying an 8 or 12 oz larger bag).<br /><br />When I went to get a bag this evening, I noticed they were slightly open and the chips were stale.  I checked the rest of the bags in the box and most of them were open.  I think it may have to do with the oil on the chips.  They seeped into the seal and loosened the glue.<br /><br />I called into Amazon Customer Service and the CSR was pretty rude.  The first question she asked was why I didn't report this earlier.  Duh, maybe because I didn't notice the problem until now?  I've been very happy with Amazon's Customer Service in the past and have been buying 100s of dollars product during this Christmas season.  Hopefully this was just a cranky CSR and not indicative of Amazon's direction for customer service.

review/summary: Yummy chips!
review/text: My son and I agree. These are fine flavored potato chips! The Kettle brand has a lot of interesting variations on flavoring. This is one of those we like best from their stable of goodies.<br /><br />I went to graduate school in Buffalo, lived in Western New York for years, and frequented the Anchor Bar, where chicken wings were invented. So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed. I would prefer a bit more of the bite/heat of a Buffalo chicken wing, but that is not a serious issue. I find it amazing that this product can even hint at the pleasures of Buffalo chicken wings!

Besides, they are not greasy to the point of being unpleasant...and their durability when facing even the most daunting dip...7 layer, chunky salsa, and even heavy cream cheese dips...is well worth the trade off.

review/text: I've found a new taste treat. I'm not a big one for potato chips, so I am sure I've come late to discover these. I think they are really good. The processing & ingredients list is actually pretty good-no trans fats, etc. So, if you want an indulgence, these are A+ ! They are thicker & more tasty than the mass produced potato chips we've all come to know. They are much more flavorful. Never had this flavor before. before. Incredibly good & a flavorful combination of sweet, tangy, salty. Also not overly hot or spicy. Excellent!<br /><br />These arrived in a case of individually wrapped chips. Each one was in great shape. No open or broken bags. No mess, no crumbs.<br /><br />If you want a snack, have something REALLY good. It's got to be worth the calories-and these are!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: What I like about them:<br />1) Krinkle makes very thick chips, what's even better is that the krinkle cut chips feel even thicker because they are krinkled or have ridges in them.<br />2) No trans fat and all natural, according to the info on the bag.<br />3) Flavor, but that's a subjective thing. I like the peppery flavor of these.<br />4) 2oz bags, which keep you from eating too much at one time. Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

These chips are rich, bold and delicious. The quality of the potatoes used are excellent. I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Buffalo Bleu
review/text: I bought cases of the large bags of Buffalo Bleu, New York Cheddar and a medium sized case of Spicy Thai.  The cheddar kind of tastes like pringles to me, but the others in my family really like them.  The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.  The smallest bag might be the most expensive per ounce but they will probably last longer.

It's a shame that the independent chip companies are dying out at the local grocers because Frito-Lays crowds them out, when the independents are so much better.  Take a trip to your local Trader Joe's or Amazon to find good chips nowadays, and cheap too if you find them on sale here, cheap all the time at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: One of the healthier chips
review/text: Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.

review/summary: Where is the blue cheese??
review/text: These are nothing more than barbecue potato chips.  Covered with a dusting of chili powder, salt, and sugar, I would not buy these again. I really love blue cheese, but I can't taste it in these chips. I should never buy anything I haven't tried, and now I'm stuck with all these bags of chips that I don't like. I have tried the salt and cracked pepper flavor and wish I had bought them instead.

review/summary: A salty, spicy crispy delight!
review/text: This flavor of Kettle chips is my favorite.  I always need to have a few of these bags laying around for a good movie or sporting event.  Krinkle cut happens to be my favorite type of chip and kettle chip delivers on these.  Not only are the chips always crispy and fresh, but they have a perfect coating of salt and pepper.<br /><br />That coating creates a nice blend of salt w/ a bit of nice black pepper kick that lets you know the chip is willing to give a bit of bite before surrendering.  I've gotten a few boxes of these over the past year and have had no problems with the chips or unbalanced flavoring.  Once again Kettle delivers a fantastic product that delights the taste buds

review/summary: Stale, too oily to touch and tasted weird
review/text: I ve had this exact kind a ton of times at my local deli and love their taste, figured i d save a bunch by getting a box of 24 delivered to my desk at work. Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad). Got in touch with Amazon customer care, and they were kind enough to get me a refund, but i recommend that you save yourself the hassle and give these a miss.

review/summary: Taste good but NOT truly MSG-FREE
review/text: I bought 2 cases of these chips because I heard nothing but great things about this brand and this flavor of chip in particular. However, upon receiving them today, I saw that although they state NO MSG, they DO contain Yeast Extract which acts exactly as MSG does and therefore I cannot eat them. Unfortunately ALL Kettle chips contain this ingredient so I am unable to eat any of them. I don't think I can return them but I got them at a cheap price so I will donate them or see if Amazon can let me return them since the description was a bit misleading. These chips are MUCH healthier than many other brands, so if you are not MSG sensitive, I say dig in!

review/summary: Check the label
review/text: The fact that Kettle Foods claims their products are "All Natural" really, really, really upsets me. These chips, and many other Kettle chips, contain "yeast extract." On a chemical level, yeast extract is the same thing as MSG; it's just derived from a different source. Kettle labels some of their products with "NO MSG," but their reps say people who are sensitive to glutamates should avoid their products. Be an informed consumer.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I remember these from when I was little, and they were always really fresh and the texture was very smooth. I bought some in a small package of three today, and they were all crushed inside the package,  flavorless, because there wasn't enough chocolate or caramel or nuts to make it taste like anything-just sugar,  they were stale, as even the copious amount of sugar was granulated in both the chocolate and the caramel, and the nuts were infinitesimal. They were in no way up to the standards of the ones I had before. From now on, if I want a chocolate turtle, I'll go to a candy store and get them fresh. Maybe buying them from Amazon would insure freshness, I don't know, but I wouldn't want to risk spending a lot of money on a big bag to find out they're stale, and, besides, there are other issues.

review/summary: A Natural Laxative for Cats, perhaps?
review/text: I switched from Iams regular dry kitten food to Iams Healthy Naturals a few weeks ago, after my cat turned onem thinking it would be better for him. After 2 days of eating it, he started having diarrhea and used the litterbox 4-5 times a day. This went on for a week. At first, I thought it was the canned food that I give him once a day, but he had had no problems with it before. I stopped giving him canned food anyway, and only gave him Healthy Naturals. He continued to have loose stools, and this continued for a few days after I had stopped giving him the Healthy Naturals. It was horrible! My whole apartment stank of cat poop, and I had to wipe and clean his rear end everytime he used the litterbox or there'd be stains everywhere he sat! I don't know, but maybe it just doesn't suit his digestive system. I've had him since he was 7 weeks old and he has never had diarrhea until I fed him this dry food. So, if you want to switch to this food for your cat, I'd suggest getting the smallest bag first.

review/text: all these well known brands are now owned by one Big huge company which doesn't really care about what it puts in the food... read ingredients labels.. and you'll be surprised! (we are all duped into thinking our cats are getting great nutrition.. but as it seems we are really just falling for the name brand.. if you read the label it has By-products and the only "nutrients" it has in it is artificial vitamins and minerals.. (which your cats body can't digest and use) Now... basic human reasoning would bring us to the conclusion that that the best way to get nutrients is from whole foods NOT added artificial vitamins and minerals made in a lab... soo..  I'd suggest doing a little bit of research on what is really health for your pet.... you'll be happy you did in the long run when you don't have to go to the vet with a cat with one of the many new diseases our Poor domesticated malnourished pets get from the bad food that we give them!.<br />if you can afford it look into EVO or Organic pet food. or even if you have the time try Switching them to Raw.. its the best thing you can do for them and its well worth it..<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />oh.. also... the diarrhea that you speak of is natural for the first week of switching any animals food (dogs and cats).<br /><br />Good luck with finding a good kitty cat food!<br /><br />:-)

My daughter, who does not need to eat gluten-free, commented that she likes these better than vanilla wafers for that recipe-they don't get all soggy when the pudding is refrigerated overnight. I had been looking for a gluten free cookie for this banana pudding recipe for awhile and was very pleased with the result.  My husband thought they were great too.  I would have rated these a 5 star, except Amazon did not package them well and every single cookie was broken in shipping.  They refunded my payment promptly when I reported the problem, though.

I miss eating those darned cookies, as much as I know they're not good for me in so many ways.  Well, now they can eat their adorable little hearts out, because I've got THESE!  Sunstart has performed a small miracle, and I'll be forever grateful.  One cookie bar is rich and filling enough to be a perfect dessert, and since there are 12 per box, there are enough to serve when company comes for tea.  These are also pretty enough (and tasty enough!) to serve as a part of an elegant dessert to a dinner table full of guests, too. A case of these will last for awhile, and storage in the freezer works really well - I know, because I tried it!  And the cookies are even good frozen, just like the ones those little angels on the sidewalk are selling!  Go for it, my gluten free friends.  And hey, you know what? Even if you AREN'T gluten free, you will love these, too!!!!

review/summary: This salt is amazing
review/text: I never really believed there was that much difference in types of salt until I tried this brand. A lot of cooking TV shows mentioned using kosher salt but I never though much of it. But this salt is really different than any others I've had. I don't know if it is the process of making kosher salt, or the raw source ingredients, or the shape of the flakes, but every other salt I've had pales in comparison. I even thought it might be just my imagination, but I've had people come over and after they salted something they specifically mentioned how good this salt tasted. It's not all kosher salts, though, because I tried Morton's kosher salt after this ran out and it had a horrible chemical aftertaste, and the flakes weren't as light and thin as these.<br /><br />If you don't know, kosher salt is make by evaporating water, so it's supposed to be a more natural and unprocessed kind of salt. Maybe Morton uses some other additives or something. The flakes of this salt are very light and there is no chemical aftertaste, just a very flavorful clean salt. Chefs also like this salt because the wide flakes make more contact area with meats and other foods which enhances the effect and draws out moisture faster (which is helpful in a good sear). Since the flakes are so light, this salt is even useful when it's not dissolved into the food all the way. The denser table salt is overwhelmingly salty if a patch of it hits your tongue. But the light fluffy flakes of this salt just taste like a burst of flavor. I think that's why it's the only salt where guests actually comment on the salt specifically, they probably had a pleasant surprise getting one whole flake melting on their tongue.<br /><br />My local Whole Foods stopped selling this brand so I was elated to find this salt on Amazon and hope they continue to sell it!

The subscription price is really good as well, so i would recommend going that route if you're gonna buy them. No shipping, and you save around $3 to $4 from the average store prices. Enjoy!

review/text: I had been buying these at my local health food store when they were on sale and then realized I should check on Amazon. The price was great as usual so I ordered a bunch. I love that they don't contain any weird ingredients or chemicals. They are like candy and are a great treat for me when I want a break from fresh fruit (I know that sounds strange). I guess the texture and concentrated flavor makes them a totally different experience than fresh fruit. I have tried all the flavors and apricot is by far my favorite. Tangy and sweet, just the right flavor combination. I really like raspberry as well. The strawberry is very good too but they aren't as leathery as the others which is one of the things I like about them. I would prefer an option to buy organic fruit strips. Then these would be perfect!

review/summary: Smaller then expected funny after tatse
review/text: I have bought several flavors of these fruit leathers at local grocery stores. I did not know that these came in different sizes. These were much smaller then the size in my local store so they were not as good of a deal as expected. Of course I should have looked closer at the size, the packing looked the same, so it is harder to tell then on something like a box of cereal. I love apricots. I was excited to try this flavor. It was not as fruity when I first ate it and the after tatse was kind of soapy. I have enjoyed the strawberry amd rasberry flavors so Im not sure it is just a bad batch. I wouldnt order this flavor again. Even my kids who usually eat these like candy didnt like them.

review/summary: Apples to oranges
review/text: The apricot leathers are "All-natural, 100%-fruit leather featuring apricots", but since apples are the first ingredient and apricots the second, I have no clue how much apricot they contain, but probably not very much. I'd be a lot more impressed if apricots was the first ingredient, but that would be more expensive to produce than something made mostly of apples.

review/text: This is my SECOND favorite flavor of SI fruit leathers.  My all time favorite was the Tropical flavor, but alas they seem to have discontinued it.  These bars are a great way to get your fruit serving in and travel very well!  I always take them with me on vacation.  They make a great snack in the airport and in the car!

review/summary: YUMMY!  AND HEALTHY!!!!!!
review/text: Just had to write this review to say that these saved my life while losing a WHOPPING 40 lbs on the HCG 800 calorie 10 grams of fat per day diet.  I did not do the 500 cal. Dr. Simeons diet.  This was RXd to me by a plastic surgeon that I worked for.  I searched for something like this that would be a quick on the go take in my handbag in case of emergency fruit..<br /><br />I grew up on the real fruit rolls by Jovy not found hardly anywhere anymore and nothing like the ones you can buy online here  (they are in almost all grocery type stores in the produce section on the west coast). (Joray brand is not the same as the ones I am talking about - Joray ones in my opinion are disgusting!).<br /><br /> I ran across these Stretch Island fruit strips in the health food isle of a local grocery store here in Florida  and even tho they are so spendy at 60 cents a pc for such a small slender serving I went ahead and bought one of each flavor in desperation.<br /><br />YUM!  The apricot is my fave just because the flavor is so fresh and vibrant and strong!  I don't eat apricots at all, ever,  so this really was a new exciting taste for me other than the boring strawberry or grape.  If you are or ever been on the HCG diet you know all to well the quest for new ways to change things up without sabotaging your diet.<br /><br />I did not use these as a replacement for ALL of my fruit servings of course but used these as a to-go life savor and "treat" away from the common grapefruit, strawberries, blueberries, rasps, etc.  It is not "on the list" for the Dr. S protocol (just because it has pear juice, etc) but like I said I did the real Hcg shots 5 days per week with 3-5 days per week exercise at the gym (20 mins of cardio and 1 full hour of hand weights and lunges put together by a trainer) and was active the whole time I was on the diet (not by choice but I was painting and decorating my new home at the time and had a deadline to meet).  And in case you are curious I lost the 40 lbs in about 8 weeks!  Went from 144 to 104 and was on the shots for 6 weeks and continued to lose as I transitioned off the shots and continued to eat clean and exercise.<br /><br />I still have my dad mail me the Jovy fruit rolls when I run low because they are also healthy and bring me back to when I was eye level with a shopping cart (if you haven't tried them.....DO!!!! The sour apple and watermelon are AMAZING!!!!!!!!) and I wish soooooooooooooo badly that Amazon had them because the brand they do offer on here are AWFUL - I've tried them and threw them all out.<br /><br />All in all these Stretch Island apricot strips are great...they are best when eaten in smaller bites since they are not soft and chewy but more like a thicker solid yet not dry fruit leather. Hope that makes sense!

review/summary: Yummy and nicely priced.
review/text: I'm not sure if I need the minimum 20 words to describe this item.  They are yummy.  They are healthy-no added junk.  They are portable. They are much less expensive here on Amazon than at the local grocery store.  I prefer the apricot ones, but that is just personal taste.  I have tried all of the flavors and they have all been tasty treats with little to no guilt attached (unless  I eat 5 at a time).  Did I mention that they're yummy?  Buy some, you won't regret it.  Well, if you have little to no good teeth you might not be able to eat them, but otherwise, you should be fine.  Actually... My teething 11 month old daughter has little to no teeth and she loves them too, so I take that last bit back- Enjoy!!!

review/summary: Healthy, taste great, but a bit sticky.
review/text: I was looking for a healthy fruit snack that was convenient to throw in a bag for my daughter. I read good things about this product and for the most part its great.<br />It taste good, all natural, individually wrapped.<br /><br /> There are two problems that keep it from the 5 star rating.<br /><br />1. Its pretty tough for a young child to tear into. It is called leather so you cant complain too much about that.<br /><br />2. The bigger issue is one side of the Leather is somewhat wet and very sticky so it does make for sticky hands which kind of takes away from the convenience factor. All and all a great product but it could be a bit better.

review/summary: Perfect for Espresso Drinkers Needing STRONG Coffee!!
review/text: I've suffered through having to always go get coffee out as my other half likes/needs the lower strength Donut Shop mild stuff, and I finally broke down and got me a case of 50 of these WONDEFUL Green Mountain Dark Magic K-cups.  THEY ARE PERFECT for someone that likes a strong, bold, delicious cup of coffee (and not that mild brown water some others drink)!  If I could afford espresso all the time, I'd do that, but this is a very close second and the taste is consistent.  Not one ground has come through into the cup (whereas other k-cups do).  This is some good, bold, flavorful coffee!

review/summary: Love the coffee but...
review/text: My wife and I love the Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic (Extra Bold) coffee and have been ordering it for our Keurig for months but have always purchased it in the smaller boxes (25 K-cups).  When we saw this box of 50 K-cups for about the same price per cup, we decided to order two and that way place fewer orders.<br /><br />However, we have thrown away more defective K-cups from this one box than we have from everything else we've purchased in the 6 months since we bought our Keurig machine.  And we have bought A LOT of coffee & tea, much of it from Green Mountain.  I don't know if its a problem at the factory or if its an issue with the packaging but 1/3 of the K-cups in the first box had to be thrown away.  Frankly, these things are too expensive to accept that kind of waste...not to mention the hassle of cleaning up the mess they make first thing in the morning when all I want to do is sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and wake up.<br /><br />I hope that its from the packaging (the K-cups are not as tightly packed and therefore get bounced around a lot more during shipping - I HOPE that's the root cause of the problem) and not an issue with manufacturing because I would HATE it if we had to stop buying Green Mountain products altogether. Dark Magic and Triple Black Diamond have become our two favorite coffees, replacing Newman's Own Special Blend. As it is, I will go back to ordering the smaller packages and hope that this solves the problem.<br /><br />I give the coffee five stars but only one for the packaging so I compromised by assigning 3 stars to this product.

review/summary: Good coffee
review/text: Just finished off my first Amazon packaged (50 count) box, and am impressed with the quality of the k-cup (ZERO wasted cups - no cups with broken seals, and no cups that resulted in a cup full o' grounds).<br /><br />My 5-star rating comes with a caveat.  It's not the best coffee I've had, but it is very good.  I almost gave it 4 stars, but then realized that out of all the x-bold offerings I've tried (and I've tried quite a few), it's one of my favorites at its price point.  It is a good coffee with good, bold flavor... and I did just put in an order for a second box.  My favorite from Amazon was Coffee People's Oraganic x-bold coffee (yellow foil cap).  Not sure what happened to this one, but I only see it rarely, and then at a ridiculous price (just saw it at $99 for a 24 pack... that's over $4/k-cup!!).

A bit smoother than Green Mountain's Double Black Diamond but stronger and more complex than both Nantucket Blend and Newman's Own Bold, it is full bodied even when brewed on the 14 oz setting.  It is my first cup, make that mug, in the morning as I sit in my sunroom and watch the fox make tracks into the woods and the finches and cardinals arrive at the bird feeder.  It's coffee to greet the sunrise and help you face the day ahead.

I intend to pick up a box for those days when I feel like something a little different.
