review/text: Why so great!  It has a lot less sugar than the american version and the beans hold their shape after the processing system.  A lot less mushy than the american vegetarian version.  If you are looking for baked beans with a lot less sugar then this would work for you.  Super goodness.

review/summary: American beans too sweet
review/text: Years ago I used to buy Heinz Vegetarian Baked Beans until one day I bought a tin and wondered why they tasted different.  I saw on the tin "new and improved".  I had an old tin and compared the contents.  Heinz had doubled the sugar content and lowered the fiber.  I cannot eat such sweet beans and have been making my own but they are not as good as the British recipe.  The British recipe had a fairly high sodium content but I believe they have reduced this, so maybe I will try them again.

review/summary: Good Quality Product - - but SWEET
review/text: I did not buy this product from Amazon because I wanted to try one can first.  Fortunately my supermarket (ShopRite) stocked them.<br /><br />First I must say, the beans, the sauce and the canning are of VERY HIGH quality.<br /><br />However I do not like sweet candy like vegetables.  Maybe it is part of my heritage but Italians typically make vegetables with oil and garlic, or oil and lemon.  Never sweet.<br /><br />To salvage this product I added it to two cans of white cannellini beans and added some cayanne pepper and two spoons of olive oil.  Not bad!!!<br /><br />I am giving it 5 stars based on quality and not on my taste preference.

review/summary: I Eat This Salt By The Mini-Spoonful
review/text: I just bought seven different Sea Salts via Amazon and thus far this one is my favorite.  I was worried about buying Fleur de Sel from a 'name brand' (Roland), perhaps expecting an inferior quality product, but this salt does it for me.  For all I know this Fleur de Sel is a more mass produced and cheaply made product -but I do know that straight out of the bottle I like its flavor the best out of the sea salts I have tried so far, even better than Maldon (which I expected to like the best).  The 'Non-Roland' sea salts have an after-tang I don't quite like;  this salt tastes. . .  'smoother' is the best word I can come up with right now.  I am interested to find out how this salt compares with more traditional Fleur de Sels.  4.5 Stars (to leave room for other contenders).<br /><br />Is this salt worth the price?  I'll have to get back to you on that one.  As a sea salt novice I was going to wait to review the salts after I tried them on various foods, but I am in a reviewing mood tonight, so I'll just have to update later as I experiment with the 'Salty Seven' and other new salty acquisitions.  This review is based on comparing and contrasting salts right out of the bottle/bag.<br /><br />After writing this review I am hankering for another spoonful of Roland Fleur de Sel!

review/summary: ew, gross sewer color!
review/text: I'm one of those people who won't eat foods if they look suspicious or unappealing.  Guacamole -with the exception of a wonderful authentic Mexican restaurant in southern Delaware that my family takes me to on special occasions- is mostly really awful.  The sewer-looking and barely adequate taste and appearance of guacamole just doesn't get the job done as far as leaving me satisfied.  I'd rather not eat it and I certainly don't want more.  Unfortunately this type of guacamole dip mix falls under the category I mention above.  It's really bland and just makes your food taste worse.  It's a matter of personal preferece of course so you and your family might actually enjoy it.  Me?  Not so much.  If I *have* to eat guacamole I will, but otherwise I'd rather avoid it.

My wife loves this oil as it is a healthy fat containing medium chain fatty acids like coconut oil.  It doesn't oxidize under high heat making it great for cooking.  Also it doesn't add any negative flavor to the mix.

I'm definitely going to buy more, and keep this in mind as a great little gift for people who like sweets.<br /><br />One caveat on that, thought: this wouldn't make the best gift for people who are extremely picky about appearances: the cookies themselves end up a little battered by the time they arrive, with many broken in half or chipped. If you care about the taste, this doesn't matter, but if you wanted to arrange them on a plate for company, it could be annoying. I don't (yet) know if they fare better in the single-flavor cans.

review/summary: A unique and delicious culinary gift
review/text: Flathau's Snap Pack was purchased to see how good these four flavors would compare with each other. Peppermint cookies - no way. But, yes they work. I wanted something to look forward to but not crumbly or flaky. Once you learn not to pig out and eat slowly and prudently your focus turns to flavor and the baker's sugar stays on the cookie where it belongs.<br /><br />Took these cookies to the office suite which is full of Marin County foodies and supercilious gourmet snobs. First thing I said was "you can't have any because they were made in Mississippi and you loathe anything of or about the South". To them, if its not cooked in New York City or San Francisco any possibility of these being gourmet cookies is an oxymoron. That is until they saw the UPS guy who is also a very well known caterer wolf two key lime snaps down. Recklessly tossing their political correctness and self esteem aside, the resident food fascist requested a taste which was granted despite the fact some personal injury lawyers were mixed among them.<br /><br />Doling out the Flathau's snaps for a week while emphasizing their Southern orgin was a treat in addition to the snaps. Several geographical gourmets are in recovery from the fact that something of culinary greatness came from Mississippi. Then again, ignorance is its own reward.<br /><br />These cookies are a real "pick me up" and are delicious. When dining out while traveling I will eat one for dessert and present one to the server who usually raves about the taste. Its a good way to stay on a diet and to make friends, especially with servers who are in a position to return the favor.

review/text: I saw these on food networks "Unwrapped" and couldn't wait to try them, I actually and thankfully signed up for an Amazon CC and got a 30.00 credit. So I didnt actually "pay" for these. Anyway, I was expecting the "snap" as advertised and shown on T.V. The only "snap" was actually a "crunch" of a LITTLE candy in the cookie. I was very disappointed. The flavors were okay. A very mild flavor not as I expected. A typical shortbread, not a lot of crunchy candy and over half of the cookies were broken in the package!! And about the packaging. I understood all the cookies to be in a cool paint can, apparently when you buy the sampler package they just come in a foil bag inside a cardboard box. If you only eat a few cookies the rest get stale VERY quickly. Well, One bite of each cookie was enough for me, Now I have 30.00 worth of cookies sitting in my cupboard. UNDERWHELMED and DISSAPPOINTED. Guess you shouldn't believe what you see on T.V. IMO

review/text: At first I was reluctant to try these cookies but, now that I have, I can't get enough of them.  A sales rep dropped them off at our office and then I was on the search to find them.  Thank goodness for Amazon.  The key-lime are my favorite.  They have a nice light taste of lime and they are nice and cruchy. Perfect combination of flavor and texture.

review/summary: Darn cookies taste too good...
review/text: I had never heard of these cookies before purchasing them online for part of my husbands birthday gift... He likes shortbread cookies, so thought I'd try them-they were shipped timely, and arrived in good condition. Each of the four flavors were individually packaged inside a foil bag inside it's own box.<br /><br />Darn cookies taste too good...little decandant powdered sugar dusted bites that beg you to keep eating them...oh, did I mention that I also like shortbread cookies?<br /><br /> If you like shortbread cookies, you will go for these!<br /><br />Redheaded Wife-

review/text: I was happy to have the ability to sample the four flavors of their snap cookies, but the only one I really like of the 4 is the Peppermint Snap. I received the Peppermint Snap cookies as a gift a while back, and I loved them so much, I've been on a campaign to try to find more of them. Unfortunately, Amazon only offers the 4-pack-variety or the other 3 flavors individually, but not the Peppermint Snap!

review/summary: OUT OF DATE PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: Having already ordered directly from Cafe Britt, I jumped at the chance to order Cafe Britt product from Amazon thus saving shipping costs and even getting a break on the price. My experience dealing with Cafe Britt was great. I ordered the 2lb bag of whole bean Costa Rica Dark Roast coffee and loved it.  Wanting to try something different, I ordered 2 1lb bags of Tres Rios valdivia whole bean coffee THRU AMAZOM.COM. Upon opening the first bag I noticed a difference in quality that was quite apparent. I assumed it was probably because of the different type of coffee, and only after opening the second bag did I think of looking for a freshness date on the packaging. Now I ordered this coffee on July 30 and received it on August 3rd but the package has a freshness date of JUN 12(lot # 11173407).  So it appears as if AMAZON shipped me coffee that was way out of date. I know my local grocery store is not going to sell food that is out of date so why is AMAZON doing it?<br /><br />Second Entry(8/25/11)<br />Having spoken to a customer service rep at Amazon, I have been told my out-of-date product will be replaced at no cost. I appreciate this and must commend Amazon for their responsiveness to my complaint.

review/text: I've been eating ice cream for over 50 years, and the thought of non-dairy "ice cream" didn't appeal to me, until I tried your product... Amazing! How in the world did you get a nut-based non-dairy product to taste like ice cream? I followed the directions on the label and let the Ice Supreme sit a while at room temperature, and get "spoon soft," Fabulous! As I get older, I'm paying more attention to what I put into my body, and it's a joy to read an ingredient label that does not have the multi-syllable additives, preservatives, and other hard to pronounce chemicals. Just old fashion all natural ingredients like grandma would use. Thanks for such a great product, my favorite being "Pecan Passion." The whole pecans on top are like a gift. Thanks again.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LBYW64">Almond-licious ICE Supreme - Strawberry Bliss</a><br />It is hard to believe that I finally found a product that is delicious, yet healthy.  This low calorie treat is good for persons who enjoy a vegan diet, it is organic, dairy free, sugar free, gluten free, low calorie, excellent for people with diabetis, or anyone who does not want to gain a lot of weight from eating frozen treats.  My family has a history of diabetis and we enjoy Ice Supreme without having to worry about whether it has too much sugar.  The natural taste of  agave nectar, pure vanilla bean, chocolate and strawberry nibs, we are hoping to eliminate this disease from our family.  We buy all flavors and it is "simply delicious." With more than 35% of Americans classified as obese, I highly recommend it to anyone who is lactose intolerant, enjoya a vegan diet, wants to get their weight under control, or just enjoy the natural taste of food without all of the sugar and salt.  If children ate this product, we could be well on the way to stopping childhood obesity. It is the product of choice for the children in our family now.<br /><br />Val Calvert, San Antonio

review/text: I work at CVS and whenever someone buys this water bottle, it's because of how appealing the bottle actually looks rather than the water. These come in two different types of bottle, one being glass and other being plastic. This one is a plastic bottle. Don't get me wrong, the plastic bottle still looks beautiful and is very sturdy, it's not your average poland spring bottle. Aside from the looks, the taste of the water is no different than Poland Spring or Nestle bottled water. These usually sell for $1.60 at CVS so, this price online is kind of high. If you really want to try this water, or just want the bottle for the look and future use, just go to a local drugstore or grocery and pick one up. It will be much cheaper and you will get to see and feel the bottle in person to see if it's for you. Overall, it's a good buy and offers a very appealing bottle but the taste is pretty much the same as any other bottled water. I personally bought a bottle because it is so sturdy and I can refill it for everyday use, plus the appealing presentation of the bottle doesn't hurt either.

A little stack of those in my hand, and I also have my dog's attention.  She loves these and gets the thrill of the chase when I drop them from a height and they flutter down like butterflies.  Sometimes they stick to the roof of her mouth.  The toasted ones are tastier than the raw and are ready to go.

With Amazon Prime, I could have the Emerald Cove Nori delivered to their house in 2 days. These were okay, but they were not nearly as good as the Edomae Roasted Sushi Nori that I usually use. Both my husband and I noticed a huge difference in flavor.<br /><br />They served their purpose in that I had nori when I needed it, but now I'm stuck with 5 more packages of sub-par sheets that were much more expensive than the Edomae. I'll try using them for inside out rolls; maybe the flavor won't be as noticeable if it's not the first thing to hit the tongue.

review/text: In our house we are very much snack people whether it be chips, fruit or cookies we love to snack on food. So, when we got these we was super happy to try something new. My kids love banana's so that was the first one they went for and in no time the whole bag was gone but at least I did get a picture of the stuff before it was completely gone. They also really loved the strawberry. My husband and me sampled all and they had a very pleasant taste that wasn't to strong but wasn't faint enough where you couldn't tell what fruit you were eating. It had the perfect taste. Another thing I really like is I tried the mango in some yogurt and was extremely surprised at how well it tasted plus it was nice to have a different texture in with the yogurt. I am not much of a yogurt person but this did help me a lot in wanting to eat it more often. Plus, as a mom with kids in alot of different extra curricular activities it is nice to have things like this to carry around that won't go bad and is the perfect size and serving.

I was also hugely disappointed to see it was a "Product of Bolivia".<br /><br />I was looking for a nice organic, USA grown freeze dried fruit - when I saw the "USDA approved" I assumed it was made in the USA, but it says right on the label "Product of Bolivia".<br /><br />If you are looking for a good snack, I strongly suggest checking out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV2GNW">18 Rabbits Cheeky Cherry Chocolate, Organic Granola bar, 1.9-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)</a>.  They are made in the USA and everything is certified organic, and best of all, they taste like something so good that you should feel bad eating it!

review/summary: Extremely good Kona blend for the price
review/text: I'm a coffee addict who fell in love with Kona coffee on a recent trip to Hawaii. Genuine Kona coffee is expensive and hard to find on  the mainland, but this Kona blend is inexpensive and very similar to what is brewed on the islands. Price is cheaper than any specialty coffee offered at a Starbucks or Peets, but the quality is identical. I'll be buying this again!

review/summary: Terrible! Washed-out, tasteless, not coffee!
review/text: First time I decided to try this out. For Kona the price is great of course, and the freshly opened bag is fragrant, and yet it's one of those "you get what you pay for" situations (except here you get much LESS than you paid for): the brew barely tastes like coffee (even with five teaspoons to a small cup it still tastes like boiled cardboard). You will buy a better coffee in a supermarket; any kind you pick will be better and cost about the same. Bottom line: not recommended (I won't reorder).<br /><br />***<br />05/07/2012: I'm so pissed I paid for this crap, I'm trying to get a refund. The ground matter itself, when dry, smells nice, but the brew... you could brew sawdust with the same exact result. No taste, no aroma, no caffeine kick, no matter how much you use per cup. Black sludgewater. Horrible, and should be against the law to sell it. The only use for this junk I can see is to sprinkle it around the house dry -- 'cause it smells nice while dry. This product is a quintessential ripoff; stay away.<br /><br />05/14/2012: Sent it back and just got a refund. Whew! So that's that. At least I can thank them and Amz for the complete lack of hassle with returns.

I also keep it refrigerated after opening), or it's a package issue, but this coffee has no taste.  I am sorry to say that I will not buy it again.

review/text: I was looking for a Kona blend  as I can't financially justify the pure Kona coffee. Amazon offered the Magnum Kona Blend and I ordered 2 pounds. I found my first pot too strong using 6 tablespoons for 6 cups as I did with my previous Kona blend. I then went to 5 tablespoons, still too strong. I then went to 4 and that was the winner. So I got the same enjoyment with only 4 tablespoons instead of 6. GOOD DEAL!!!

review/summary: My favorite cereal since I was a kid
review/text: I grew up eating Quaker Oatmeal Squares, and they're still my favorite cereal and a great source of fiber - I tried Fiber One for a while, but the aspartame in it gave me headaches and Fiber One leaves an awful aftertaste. Quaker's doesn't have aspartame, and there's tasty brown sugar which gives it just the right amount of sweetness (the cinnamon sugar one is really good too!)<br /><br />What I love about Quaker Oatmeal Squares is that they're perfectly delicious with or without milk. They're super crunchy without, and after soaking in milk for a while they absorb the liquid and become like cereal-milk gushers. I personally like that, but for those who don't, you can always just eat the cereal immediately after adding milk.

review/text: This is a great cereal. What more could you ask than something that tastes good and is good for you. Take a good look at the nutritional panel. On a very reliable site that evaluates food by grade (can't remember the site)they gave it an "A". This is the highest rating and is usually reserved for fruits and vegetables. The thing I like about this cereal is that it's great in milk and stays very crunchy for a long time. But the best thing is that they make a fantastic dry snack. You can have a cup, for a reasonable amount of calories, munch on them, and be satisfied. I put some in a ziplock and snack on them all day. I have given boxes to my friends and they and their kids love them too.

As for oat based cereals, Cheerios is a bit expensive and so is this, but this beats it in texture, flavor, and viability of eating dry straight out of the box. Quaker's product line has some things that I don't like, but I know to spot the brand name to find some new ways to enjoy oats.<br /><br />They rarely go on sale at the supermarket. The lowest I've seen was 4 for $6, but I was in NY and it got buried in snow and we had no power for a week, so I missed stocking up.

I used to be allergic to yellow #5 and #6 before (it would make me jump off the walls as a kid!).  I thought I outgrew it.  Maybe this is an "adult" allergy.  Quaker, keep the food dyes out!
