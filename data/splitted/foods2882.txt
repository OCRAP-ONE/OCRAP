review/summary: Excellent and so important to good health
review/text: I have ordered these several times and they are supplying in one nut- 100% of your requirement of selenium a day!  I eat one and sometimes 2 a day. I even give one to my great dane a few times a week to keep him healthy. They taste good so a nice snack for me is a Brazil nut and a few walnuts daily. Helps m lose weight also because its ba healthy snack not a sugary high calorie one. I have not craved junk food and high calorie sweets.

review/summary: On the yellow and soft side
review/text: I thought these nuts were a bit stale and soft. I have had fresh organic brazils (very white and crisp), but they are hard to come by; the typical brazils that one purchases most places are not very exciting. Not sure if I should have voted 2 stars, or three; since these brazils are like most I've purchased, I voted for 3

review/summary: Excellent Nuts, Good Packaging, Not Great
review/text: These brazil nuts are really full of flavor and texture, very satisfying to eat. I have ordered perhaps 4 times, and never had a bad bag.  They have always been tasty and fresh and delicious.<br /><br />The packaging is sufficient to keep the nuts fresh, but it doesn't really re-seal all that well.  It is supposed to be resealable, but I have a hard time making use of it.  We end up putting a clip on it, or transferring them to a sealed container, because the "stickem" used to hold the package together after opening really isn't sufficient.  Since you eat only a few of these at a time, you will want to keep them fresh, as the package will last awhile and you will go in and out of the package routinely.<br /><br />These aren't salted nuts that you put out at a party and people eat by the handful and are gone the next day.  These are very rich tasting, and high in some key nutrients (magnesium, potassium, and selenium). Most people's health would benefit by eating an ounce or so (3-6 nuts) a day; selenium is practically absent in Western diets, and magnesium is also deficient in the typical American diet.<br /><br />The packaging is the only minus, but it is such a small minus, I still give them a 5 star rating.  By far, my favorite nuts!

review/summary: Orders vary in freshness, no longer worth this price (edit 10/2011)
review/text: In August I gave this company a 5-star review after my first bag of nuts.  They were fresh and big and I was impressed.  I deleted that review as I'm only allowed one review and just received an order today (10/2011) I'm not impressed with.  The nuts in this order were Smaller and not fresh and for the very high price I expected what I received the first time.  I can get what I got today from any store around and for much cheaper.  Now I'll have to evaluate if I want to risk buying from this company again as my money is important to me and I won't waste it with a company that doesn't give me what I pay for (plus they were already over-priced at about eighteen bucks for quite awhile and the price just went up four to five bucks...rip off).

review/text: I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned.  We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.  We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout.  We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well.  Definitely a great find.

I always thought expensive meant good.  Even my picky gs eats this with no canned dog food or any other incentive.  Of course the puppy will eat anything, and everything, lol,but his coat is beautiful and I have not had any digestion problems.  I love that it is USDA grade meat and no corn.  Corn can kill st bernards.  All this for just a couple bucks more than hills science.  Love the fact that I can feed both dogs same food on the all stages kind.

review/summary: Wrong bag pictured
review/text: Just an FYI to other customers: This item is for the Beef and Ocean Fish formula which is in a RED bag. In my haste, I purchased this thinking it was a the 15lb version of the Chicken and Rice formula. Woops! So I went and bought the 15lb bag of Chicken and Rice and mix the Beef and Fish in so it didn't wreak havoc on my pup's digestive system.<br /><br />I can say that after we started feeding this to my pup, she starting having stinky farts and had never had them before. Also, Roshan's right about the fish breath! Ick.<br /><br />Overall, my dog has no issues with this formula, it's just stinky so I'll stick to Chicken and Rice after this bag is done.

review/text: The adoption worker at our local humane society recommended this product because it is grain free and high in meat content.  Our dog loves this food.  We have a relatively small dog who is still in his puppy stage, and the kibbles are the right size.

review/summary: My girl oves this food!
review/text: I am surprised at  a lot of the negative comments on Canidae. I have a 2 year old German Shepherd who is a picky eater and has sensitive skin.  I tired 4 other brands of food: Innova, Natural Balance, Taste of the Wild and Evo....all of which she scratches and bites herself constant.  With Canidae, she has a beautiful shinny coat, doesn't itch and she loves it!  It's amazing the difference.  Her stools sometimes are loose, but nothing to complain about or worry.  I'm not putting down those other foods, I'm just saying that this Canidae food has down wonders for her!  I've gotten wuite a few comments on her shinny coat.  Every dog is different and you just need to find a perfect dog food like I did for her.  We use the Chicken version on her.  If you on dog food analysis, you will notice it has a 5 star rating.  Jetta and I are both very happy with Candiae!!

review/summary: don't buy this stuff
review/text: I have used this dog food for years.  About a year ago they reduced the size of the bag and increased the price.  I continued to buy it.  No one told me there was any change in formula.  My elderly dog started getting hot spots and vomiting yellow stuff. I thought it was just an upset tummy. The vet treated her with antacids and cortizone creams. My poor dog has been through a lousy time.  She was drinking massive amounts of water. I had her kindeys and blood sugar checked.  She was ok there.  Last month, I changed her to California Naturals because it costs less and I can get it at a cheaper store. She has stopped vomiting and doesn't drink as much water.  I didn't even think about it, until I was reading the reviews online and saw the same symptoms in other people's dogs.  I will not go back to Canadae.  Keep away from this crappy dog food.  If your dog is the least bit sensitive, it will create toxic effects for your dog. It is poisonious to those dogs with allergies.

review/text: My dog was on Canidae for almost 2 years and she loved it.  She was healthy with a full, shiny coat and plenty of energy.  Then suddenly around December she started vomiting and having loose yellow stools, and became very lethargic.  We took her to 2 vets and after several hundred dollars in tests they couldn't find anything wrong with her.<br /><br />I did some research and found that there were numerous people having the exact same problems I was!  It turns out, they recently changed their formula, changed manufacturers, and decreased the amount of food in their package.  Do some research, it's not the same high-quality food it used to be!

review/summary: After feeding for 5 years, we're done
review/text: We fed Canidae to our two dogs for almost 5 years--they always ate it eagerly, never had stomach upset, and got raves from the vet for their muscle, weight, and coats.  It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com.

review/summary: Another bad reaction. Why risk it?
review/text: We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?

Also be aware that these used to be 40 lb. bags for the same price they now sell a 35 lb. bag for.

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: Although I have not bought canidae through Amazon (there is a local store near me that carries the life all stages 40LB bag for $35) I just wanted to write in and remark how impressed I am with this food.  I have an almost 2 year old chocalate lab.  When i got him from the breeder at 9 weeks he was on Eukanuba, which he stayed on with me at 1st.  After talking to a friend who breeds world class vizlas, she told me how she feeds them Canidae and how wonderful it is.  I switched over to Canidae then thank god and ever since.  My chocalate lab people actually think is a black lab.  He is the darkest chocolate lab u have ever seen, his coat is so beautiful and glossy, when he was on the eukanuba it was light brown and discolored.  Coats can be a huge problem with choc labs, but canidae has solved that problem.  With all the problems with menu foods that include so called good foods like eukanuba, science diet, iams, etc, it is a relief i can trust canidae and not be worried about all that.  Very impressed overall.....

review/summary: Lots of dogs getting sick from this product (including mine)
review/text: Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their "formula" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years.

review/summary: Beware the new formula!!!!
review/text: I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there.

review/summary: New formula nothing like old!
review/text: We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars.

review/summary: Used once and switched
review/text: I have a new Akita puppy, and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I couldn't get the breeders type of food in my area. After transitioning him to the Canidae, his stools were loose and yellow. I looked on-line, and saw that Canidae switched their formula, and my puppy's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about. I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy, and everything has been coming out fine since.

review/summary: Corn isn't dog food.
review/text: Canidae has been excellent for my dogs. My Siberian can be picky at times but they all seem to like Canidae. The company was open and informative with me.(1.800.398.1600) I'll not be feeding my dogs ANYTHING that comes out of China unless we go flat broke. Many foods(pet & people) say "Made in America" but most of the ingredients are from foreign countries and the food is only pressed together and packaged here. I consider this dishonest and immoral. It's also obviously legal thanks to federal policy that favors 'Free-trade/profit' over the health of American children, much less their pets. A premium food, sans fillers and trash, really is no more expensive since you feed less of it. Your dog will be healthier. Call this company and other companies and ask about their ingredients. Science diet and Purina will, for good reason, be way more evasive than Canidae.

We've been using it for years for a pup that seems to have every food allergy under the sun, and he's thrived on it.<br /><br />In one month (Aug-September, however, the price jumped from $59.99 to over $78.00 (for you non-math people that's a 30% increase).<br /><br />This bag was the anchor of my monthly Amazon order, but now that the price has made it un-economical to buy through Amazon, I will parcel out my orders to have a more economical result.

review/summary: Dog didn't like the taste
review/text: Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1-acre fenced yard I don't bother.

review/summary: Beware new formula!
review/text: Be very aware that the new formula ALS is not agreeing with a lot of dogs.  I have one of these dogs and no amount of transitioning improved the diarrhea, vomiting, and hot spots.  There are many, many complaints on the web by people with dogs having the same symptoms that finally stopped upon changing to another food.  Canidae made major changes to their ALS formulas and did nothing to alert the public until they had to (their web site only).  There is still nothing on the bags to make people aware of the changes except a new ingredient list.  Do your homework before buying this dog food.  Dog owners across the country have spent lots of money unnecessarily at the vets trying to find answers to their dogs medical problems only to find that it's the food they've been feeding.  Used to be an outstanding product!  Wish I could give zero stars!

review/summary: Terrible and Dangerous to Feed
review/text: I fed Canidae ALS (old formula) for 7+ years and my dogs thrived.  Canidae switched their formula (and mfg) and I immediately switched to another food afer the reported of problems.  My feed store talked me into trying their 'new' formula, and I went back to ALS - BIG mistake.  I have experienced 15-20+% weight loss, explosive diarreha, vomitting, lethargy. etc.  I have 5 dogs - 60-100+ lbs, varying pedigrees, ages 1 to 12+ - all sick (15-20% weight loss, poor coats, vomitting, etc.).  I have had to run complete extensive blood panels to rule out other health problems on all the dogs - bottomline - blood panels were OK, food (Canidae) was the issue.  What use to be a fantastic food is now a very dangerous food to feed.  An entire pack of dogs' health declined on the 'new' formula.  I switched foods (something other than Canidae) and my dogs are now recovering.  If you love Las Vegas and Russian Roulette feed Canidae - if want to avoid major Vet expenses and heartache choose another food.  Do your homework - research the Canidae ALS problems - then make the best 'educated' decision for you and your pets.<br />----<br />It's been a over a year since I originally posted review of this product, and I thought it was time for an update.<br /><br />I still warn folks from feeding Canidae ALS...other Canidae formuals I don't know.  My dogs have recovered (thank goodness).  They are back to running the fenceline, greeting visitors, etc. - and not as sickly as they had become - aka the lethergic, diarreha, lost weight crew I was faced with.<br /><br />I know there are a bunch of pros and cons out there on various websites concerning Canidae - and I use to be one of the biggest 'flag wavers' for Canidae....until the formula change and the Vet expenses I was forced to face.  Believe me - with a very heavy heart I cannot recommend Canidae any more.  I do not do this with a flare of being noticed on the Internet, any vindications against the company, or any personnal gain...just a great concern for the illnesses I've experienced with my 'pack' (5+ dogs).  It took several months (under Vet care & dry dog food changes) for my dogs to recover, and I don't want to see any other 'beloved family members' undergo what I've/we've gone through.  Please, please, PLEASE check out [...] (a highly recommended (non-bias)dog food analysis site).  They are still recommending Canidae ALS as a 5-Star (6 star being the highest rating) premium food to feed - with the caveate 'However, from a position of being a product about which DFA heard very few complaints, the number of animals we hear of that do not do well on this food appears to have risen substantially.'<br /><br />All I ask is do your own personal research concerning this food, keep an eye on your pet's food reactions, and make the best 'educated' decision for your beloved 'four footed/furry' family members.

review/summary: Packaging was already open!!!
review/text: When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it "Canidae" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip

review/summary: CANIDAE - a best choice for Fido or FiFi
review/text: I searched for a food that wasn't full of preservatives and fillers, and didn't cost $5 a pound.  I did alot of research and read alot of labels.  I have a Siberian Husky pup, and Canidae has really proven itself to me.  As a former conissour of cheap discount store dog foods, I have finally realized the advantages of feeding a natural premium food.  My dogs poop doesnt really stink!  True!  Poop is still poop, but the smell is minimal.  I have noticed it also quickly disinigrates into the ground when it rains.  With the cheap food, it smelled like rank dog poop! Would make you retch and gag!  And there was so much of it!  Less poop, firmer stools with barely any odor, less food consumed per day.  AND NO BAD BREATH from your dog! A food that swells up when wet is also undesirable.  Flint River Ranch brand and Canidae both stay intact, avoiding the bloat factor. I learned, you can learn too!  It's also an excellent value - Try Canidae, you'll see!

I've talked to most of the suppliers of Canidae in the Chicago area, and they are receiving countless complaints about very sick dogs since the new formula was introduced.<br />I'm taking my dog off of this food immediately.  He's been sensitive to different foods in the past, but never as violently as this.<br />It's disturbing that they would make this switch without notification.  At least I finally know what's wrong with my dog, and that it's been happening to countless others.  Beware.

review/text: We've had dogs and cats for years and always fed them Science Diet or Iams.  Our newest dog was an itcher and after research, I decided to try a new dog food.  I settled on Canidae for the same reason as the other reviewers; top notch ingredients at a reasonable price.<br /><br />She loves it.  I alternate dry with dry/wet every other day.  And, best of all, no more itching or hot spots.  Vet believes that she was allergic to corn products in Iams; a common allergy for dogs.<br /><br />And the added benefits are about the poop; less poop to pick up, poop is solid, not runny, and like the other reviewer said, the poop is way less smelly.

review/summary: Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle
review/text: **Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says "Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like "Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered."  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a "raw food is the only way to go" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.  As much as I'd like to support local business, my local natural pet store is terrible (it's a long story), so I buy Canidae here on Amazon.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Chicken meal, turkey meal, lamb, potatoes, peas, chicken fat (preserved with mixed tocopherols), lamb meal, ocean fish meal, tomato pomace, natural flavor, choline chloride, suncured alfalfa meal, inulin (from chicory root), lecithin, sage extract, cranberries, beta-carotene, rosemary extract, sunflower oil, yucca schidigera extract, dried enterococcus faecium fermentation product, dried lactobacillus acidophilus fermentation product, dried lactobacillus casei fermentation product, dried lactobacillus plantarum fermentation product, dried trichoderma longibrachiatum fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, copper proteinate, ferrous sulfate, zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, potassium iodide, thiamine mononitrate, manganese proteinate, manganous oxide, ascorbic acid, vitamin A supplement, biotin, niacin, calcium pantothenate, manganese sulfate, sodium selenite, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin, vitamin D3 supplement, folic acid, papaya, pineapple.

review/summary: WARNING -- read reviews--Canidae has changed their formula.
review/text: My husband and I switched our three dogs to Canidae earlier this year based on the many glowing recommendations that I found on the Internet.  Our dogs have done very well on it until recently (we always bought the 40 pound bags for our three LARGE dogs but now it's in the 35 pound bags) when they all became ill with diarrhea.  My oldest dog has had diarrhea and horrible hot spots all over his buttocks with the fur falling out and flaky dry skin for the last few weeks.  After one of my dogs was sick all over the house today, my husband mentioned that he was beginning to suspect it was the Canidae -- he suspected that Canidae may have changed their formula, so I checked the Internet to see if anyone else was complaining and there are complaints all over the Internet!  Apparently Canidae changed their formula without warning and many dogs who have tolerated it well in the past are suddenly becoming violently ill.  My husband is picking up a bag of another brand tonight, that we have used with no problems in the past, so that we don't have to feed them any more of the Canidae. Most dog owners know NOT to change their pets food suddenly as it can cause them to become ill, but apparently Canidae did it without warning anyone or allowing them the opportunity to gradually switch their dogs over to the new formula.  Apparently Canidae is blaming 'net hysteria as the reason why people are blaming their food for these dog illnesses -- but our dogs have been sick for several weeks now, way BEFORE we even suspected it was the Canidae.

review/text: My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.

review/summary: Very good ingredient list with extras.
review/text: I have a Goldendoodle and felt he was a little on the thin side, so I started researching dog foods. I found that what he was on, was not really good for him. The second ingredient was ground corn and I found out that shouldn't be in the dog food at all. It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it.

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less "filler", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a "super-premium" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan. When you look at it like that, I believe it's one of the best values in pet nutrition on the market today.

review/text: This used to be a great food, but they've changed the formula and my dogs have suffered.  Their customer service is very rude.  My dogs showed signs of distress within the first 24 hours of eating the new formula.  Explosive Diaherra, Vomiting, Fur became dull.  Change it back Canidae!!!

review/summary: Not recommended after they changed their formula
review/text: I started feeding my dogs Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food almost 5 years ago. Prior to that I used NutroMax. Wow, what an amazing food. My german shepherd and 2 golden retrievers have the most incredible coats. Their poops are firm (and easy to pick up) and nearly odorless. No allergies either, unlike most of my friends whose poor dogs suffer from all kind of food or skin problems. I've convinced one person to change to Canidae and she too is very happy with how well her golden is doing on it. I buy it locally as I go thru 40 pounds every 3 weeks (feeding 3 large dogs). I highly recommend this food, could not be happier.<br /><br />Update: Canidae moved their manufacturing to a different plant in late 2008 and at the same time, in order to save money, changed their formulas. Added a lot more grain and other products that have caused dogs to have numerous skin and GI problems. The organization that oversees pet food standards has received more complaints about Canidae than any manufacturer in recent history, due to their formula change. A fried of mine owns a pet supply store and he says he is getting about 50% of the Canidae bags back from owners w/ pets having problems w/ the new formula. All 3 of my dogs had bad reactions, and I even did a gradual change over because I was told ahead of time (by my friend) that they changed the formula. Diarrhea, vomiting, itching, scratching. My one golden scratched himself raw to the point I had to take him to the vet. After using Canidae for many years, and recommending it to many others, I decided enough is enough and got rid of all of it. I switched to using California Natural Lamb and Rice and Orijen Adult, two all natural foods produced with the highest quality control available. Both company control the ingredients, manufacture the food, have numerous quality checkpoints, and do their own distribution. My dogs are different ages and have different needs so I do a blend of the CalNat and Orijen and  WOW, what a difference. Their coats are shiny, their energy levels are great and poops are solid and virtually odor free. And they love it! Both are great foods, a bit more expensive than other foods but to me, worth every penny. Cal Nat and Orijen are the best foods you can buy in my opinion. If you are considering Canidae, I'd recommend you look at Cal Nat or Orijen instead.<br /><br />New Rating:<br />Canidae - 0 stars<br />California Natural - 5 stars<br />Orijen - 5 stars (I'd give Orijen 10 stars if I could, it really is that good).

review/summary: Excellent, AMERICAN MADE, nothing imported
review/text: I work for a veterinary hospital, and after the big food scare I found myself calling around to different food companies to see who made an AMERICAN product. And by American, I didn't mean imported products thrown into a food assembled in the United States so it could be called "made here." I wanted meat grown here, veggies grown here, and no imports. FOUND IT.<br />This dog food was recommended to me by a bloodhound breeder. Bloodhounds are known to have gunky skin (must be all the wrinkles) and they are prone to eye infections, allergies, bloat, and numerous other conditions. Well, most bloodhounds. Not her dogs. Her dogs have healthy glowing coats, shiney eyes, and just bring her lots of ribbons in the show ring.<br />My dogs are couch potatoes, but I feel better feeding them something good for them. At first I was worried the smaller bite size might interfere with good tartar control, but now months on this food NO TARTAR. At all, and my one dog had had a tartar control problem for a long time. His doggy breath has never been better. If I could give this food 10 stars, I would. I'd recommend this food for toy breeds as well as giant breeds.<br />It used to be when I opened a bag of food I'd keep my nose away because the dog food was stinky. Not this food, now, I'm not saying I want a mouthful, but it is NOT stinky like some dog foods. You can actually smell the herbs they use.<br />This product is on my wish list at Amazon. Anyone who wants to get me a good gift, get me a bag. It is definately a gift I'll use!

review/summary: The best product for the price
review/text: After reading the book "Deadly Feasts" I was horrified to learn what kinds of items may end up in my dogs' food! I started researching different dog foods and consistently received the same brand recommendations: Innova, Canidae, Wellness, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul...etc. I initially settled on Canidae, but also tried Wellness on a recommendation. The Wellness produced loose stools in two of my foster poodles, so I no longer use that brand. The Canidae, however, is perfect for my multi dog household, which often includes dogs ranging from puppyhood to senior status. The ingredients are phenomenal and, as all reviewers have said, the food contains no corn, wheat or soy, all common allergens in dogs. Although I also use and would recommend Innova Evo dry dog food, Canidae costs $35 for 40 pounds and Innova costs about $50 for a 28 pound bag. So, if you are budgeting a bit but would still like to give your dog the best, Canidae is great. After switching my dogs to Canidae, I noticed several things. First, my labrador retriever's coat sheen increased to the point of nearly blinding me in the sunglight; second, he lost about 10 pounds and developed greater muscle tone (although he was always fed recommended portions of commercial foods); third, my shedding dogs shed a lot less than in the past; and fourth, bad doggy breath is greatly reduced. I see no excuse not to switch your dog from a commercial food to Canidae or another super premium brand - it costs no more than a fancy bag of Iams or Science Diet, but can add quality years to your pets' lives! If you own a dog prone to allergies, such as a poodle, this food can't be beat. I had a family adopt a 5-pound malipoo from me and they emailed me to say they cannot feed him anything other than Canidae or he develops loose stools and needs to be taken out to the bathroom contantly. For your dog's sake switch their food; you can do a lot better than chain-store foods!

review/text: Just bought a bag of Canidae with the new formula.  I had some of the old Canidae formula and am mixing in with some of the new formula.  The new formula has more meat in it and my puppy loves the new formula!  He jumped on it!  It's unfortunate that Canidae didn't announce that they were going to change the formula because it's making a lot of dogs sick due to the sudden change in food.

review/summary: New formula
review/text: My dogs have been on Canidae for the past several years and even the picky dog who has lost over half her teeth loved it.  However, I recently bought a new bag of Canidae.  The packaging was different, but I thought that was the only thing that had changed because there was nothing on the bag indicating it was a new formula.<br /><br />I noticed the kibble was a lighter color than in previous bags, but still didn't think much of it. However, two out of my three dogs now consistently refuse to eat it.  The only dog who will eat this new bag is the one who has been on a diet for two years and quite frankly, will eat anything.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed that the change in the formula was not even mentioned on the bag and that they changed a great food into one that my dogs won't eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I emailed Canidae to ask why the formula had changed, and why it was not mentioned on the new bags.  Their response:<br /><br />*********<br />Our quality of raw material as well as quality control has actually increased not decreased. Yes we have diversified our complex carbohydrates as rice continues to climb and high quality availability decreases. Our products are better than ever and more consistent. We are getting a lot of positive feedback from our customers that are actually feeding their pets our improved formulas.<br />*********<br /><br />I hadn't actually said I thought their raw material decreased...just that 2 of my 3 dogs now refused to eat it.  And when they say they are getting positive feedback from our customers that are *actually* feeding the new formula, are they trying to imply that I only pretended to feed the new food?!?!

review/summary: Something's Changed with Canidae food
review/text: I fed and recommended this food for several years as one of the best dry foods available. However, over the last few months (late 2007) something has changed.  My dogs experienced chronic digestive upset on the food and refused to eat it.  Upon switching to another quality food, the problems stopped.  I tried another bag last week-- same results.  Other dog owners/breeders/vets/handlers have also reported problems with Canidae foods over the past few months.  No one, including myself, has been successful in getting any sort of satisfactory reply from Canidae when asked if they had changed formulas, ingredient suppliers, etc. I'm disappointed-- Canidae was one of the few 'quality foods' that had not raised prices significantly over the past year and was still affordable for most dog owners.  Apparently that has also led to changes that the company has not been willing to address.  I'm very disappointed that a food I recommended so highly in the past has had these problems.  I've changed my dogs to Eagle Pack Holistic Selects. It's more expensive, but they are back to their old selves-- healthy, no digestive troubles, and great coats.

review/summary: Why mess with success?
review/text: My 20-month-old Toy Fox Terrier mix has been eating Canidae since I adopted her and changed her over from Science Diet, so I don't have an amazing transformation story.<br /><br />However,<br />1. She's only been sick twice to speak of. No unexpected need to go outside NOW or accidents in the house because of illness. What comes out of her is as predictable as the sunrise, albeit somewhat less pleasant overall.<br /><br />2. This 12-pound, high-energy dog eats just under 1 cup a day. A 40-pound bag lasts me about 6 MONTHS, which calculates as less than $7/month for food. Canidae may cost more than better-known brands, but it's a bargain for the improved nutrition and related benefits (see 1 and 3).<br /><br />3. It never occurred to me that it could be because of her food, but it's true she has basically no smell, as others have mentioned. She's in every way glossy, happy, clean, and puppy-like.

review/summary: The best food and can save money!
review/text: I have 2 jack russells and a Papillon.  As many people know Jacks are an extemely active breed and keeping weight on them can be a problem.  We were feeding Flint River, a very high quality food,  both of my jacks were getting 2 cups a day just to maintain a slightly below average weight. My papillon was at the proper weight but still getting 1.5 cups of flint river a day.  We decided to switch foods and after much debate we chose canidae.  During the time it took to slowly switch foods(14 days) my jacks had already gained weight and were looking much better.  After 3 weeks we had to reduce their food becuase they were getting fat!  now my jacks eat 1/2 a cup twice daily and they have never looked better.  My papillon eats 1/4 cup AM and 1/2 cup PM.  Just the reduction in food alone has saved so much money.  Because we are feeding less there is less poop to clean up.  I really cannot say enough about this food its has made my dogs more balanced mentally and physically.

review/summary: Long Time Loyal Customer NO Longer!
review/text: I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a "hot spot" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an "allergic reaction."  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems.

review/text: We are told to improve our diet. The same is true for our pets. You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either, but it is because of the quality ingredients. My sons Collie gets it since a few month, and now the fur is much shinier, the dog does not smell and it loves the food.

review/summary: I actually heard about the formula change and properly transitioned my dog without issue
review/text: I have been using this food for 4 years since I read raving reviews on many sites. I was looking for a reasonably priced food which was better in quality than the cheap chain crap. I didn't want to pay $2 a pound for a high quality food and Canidae was just right for my budget and quality needs. My dog loves it (but you can't really judge it on that alone as he is a lab and will eat anything) however his coat is nice, his stool is the right consistency, and he is hardly ever ill. He also NEVER EVER has gas (but he does burp from time to time but not smelly like others have mentioned.) I wasn't happy when the price increased and the quality supposedly dropped a bit but I am still happy with this food overall and have continued to use it. I am always on the lookout for high quality food at a reasonable price so if anyone knows of something high quality at around the same price point please respond to this post and let me know.<br /><br />On a different note, was I the only person who actually DID hear about the formula change before it was too late? When I went to purchase more food and saw that the 40lb bag was discontinued I went looking for a reason why and to make sure there weren't any other issues. Right on their website it mentioned the formula change, bag change, and the proper way to transition your dog from the old to the new food to avoid digestive issues. As I had 1 full bag of old formula left, I followed the instructions and guess what, no issues whatsoever with the transition. My dog did NOT get sick at all and has not had a single problem with this food new or old formula.

review/summary: Excellent. Product HAS NOT changed.
review/text: I have been a Canidae (PAWS) customer since Feb 07 (7 lg dogs). I previously fed them Purina One, switched to Blue Buffalo in Dec 06, then Canidae in Feb 07 (food scare for Blue Buffalo). I am very particular about what I give my dogs: dog of 10yrs died/cancer and had 2 knee replacements due to arthritis/joint issues. My Dogs are doing great on Canidae. I just spoke w/ Canidae less than 2 mins ago and they HAVE NOT changed their product at all. I read the review from the person that once gave this product a great review and now thinks the product has changed due to her dogs' digestive issues (or something like that).  I left a msg for Canidae about 20 mins ago, and they already called me back at work to answer my questions (unlike Blue during the food scare).  If you have seen a blog concerning something about Acetaminophen being in Canidae, that is false. Some lady said she had Canidae and some other foods tested by putting them in a baggie together...blah blah, any way it was a false allegation but the internet spreads rumors like wildfire. I drive 2 hrs to re-stock on Canidae. Highly recommend.

review/summary: My Black Labrador throws up the new formula of Canidae All Life Stages Dry Dog Food
review/text: My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />"Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket."<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />"We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car."<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The "Canidae Team" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?

review/summary: Outstanding super premium dog food!  The best in my opinion!  I couldn't be happier!
review/text: I have been researching dog food for a few years now.  I am living in Japan (US Military) and I was ordering my dog food from PetCo online.  I have tried Solid Gold Hund N' Flocken, DVP's Natural Balance, Costco Kirkland Super Premium, Eukanuba FP Prescription Diet, and Hills ZD Ultra Allergen Free Prescription Diet.<br /><br />I was able to source the Canidae and the Solid Gold foods locally for my Dal with serious allergies.  Both of the foods have had better results than the super pricey prescription diets.  I am sold on Candidae.  I pay $[...] for the 40 LB sack, which is not that bad considering I am sourcing it locally on the Tokyo economy.  The dogs love this food more than the Solid Gold, but I believe that they are both fine foods.  This food looks tastier than the Solid Gold Wolf Pup that I was feeding my K9 German Shepherd, and it seems heartier that the Hund N' Flocken as well.  It just looks like it must taste good.  The dogs go nuts over it like a crack addiction!  I am very happy that I have found a solution that is applicable to both dogs!<br /><br />There is something to be said of companies that go the extra mile for our man's best friend.  It is just not right to feed our pets the crap that they sell in the stores.  I used to think that Eukanuba was a great dog food.  Thank God for the Internet!<br /><br />Buy this food, you will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Excellent food for all dogs
review/text: I have used Canidae products exclusively for my dogs for many years, with great results. They have healthy shiny coats, and are active and beautiful. However, my Sheltie-Chow mix had recurring ear problems all her life. The vet couldn't identify the problem--her ears weren't infected--but they always looked red and irritated. We tried everything, but nothing really helped. One day, on a whim, I bought the new grain-free Canidae, and to my surprise her ears cleared up almost immediately. All the time we had been looking for an elusive infection, but apparently she just had a wheat allergy. To test the theory, one day I fed her a piece of bread (wheat) and the next day she was tugging at her ears. Back to the grain free Canidae! The dogs love it, and the Sheltie mix just passed her 15th birthday and is going strong.

review/summary: Canidae Dog Food made my dogs extremely ill
review/text: I have relied on Canidae for my 4 dogs for over 3 years now. It was nice to have a maintenance food that all my dogs could eat. The last bag I purchased on Aug.4th smelled and looked different.  Almost immediately after feeding the dogs, my Mastiff became very ill, Bloated belly, diarrhea and lethargic.  The next day my Schnauzers became ill with the same symptoms.  I checked my bag of food and found nothing written as far as NEW FORMULA.  I cooked them all boiled chicken and rice and the symptoms went away.  I then checked on line and found many complaints about Canidae.  I am a professional dog groomer that recommended this food until now. I took my bag back the the pet store for a refund and found a better food to feed my dogs.  Canidae changing their formula cost me a vet bill for my Mastiff and a carpet cleaning bill.  I'll pass this brand by in the stores from now on.

review/summary: Canidae made my dogs VERY SICK
review/text: New food and or changed formula's need to be introduced to animals slowly. Very slowly. However, I was not given this option by Canidae when I ran out of the old All Stages Life Dry Dog Food and purchased a new bag of the new formula (no warning label) with none of the old to mix in. That is the problem I'm having with my four dogs, 2 of which are 12 years old. Granted, the changes may be an added benefit to their new formula but it's NOT a benefit if they don't notify their consumers that there has been quite an extensive change (19 additional items) to their recipe.  Meanwhile, I've had to deal with 4 dogs who have been vomiting and have bloody diarrhea as well as vet bills for the past 17 days because of Canidae's neglectful oversight on not informing their consumers. I just found out about the NEW formula 2 days ago while researching Canidae on the web and found more disgruntled consumers.  That is why I give them 1 star.  The one good thing I can say about Canidae (their old formula was great by the way) is thank God this can't be compared to the recall of last year that killed thousands of pets.  By the way, what WAS wrong with the old formula????

review/summary: Hot spots galore while on Canidae
review/text: I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.

review/summary: I will never use anythign else for my pets . . .
review/text: This food is amazing.  When I got my dog she was being fed Canidae.  I saw how clean her coat was and how healthy she looked.  So I went and got the cat version.  My big cat has lost weight and looks the best he has in years.  My little kitten is as healthy as can be.  She is now gaining good amounts of weight, but not getting plump.  It is not like other cat foods that are like McDonalds for pets.  No sudden highs and lows after eating.  I thought pet food was just pet food, but I will never change this food for my pets. It is so amazing!!!  Give it a few weeks and you will see the same.

review/summary: Excellent quality food at an excellent price.
review/text: Canidae is an excellent food that is meat based and is great for people who are looking for a top quality dog food, but don't want to break the bank. I know a lot of people who can not afford dog food that is extremely expensive, and yet they don't want to feed cheap fillers or grain based foods. If you are a person on a tight budget Canidae is worth a try. You will notice a big difference in energy as well as skin and coat. A lot of senior dogs switch to the ALS formula and have more zoomies and more energy than on other lower quality diets. Canidae is worth every penny.

Their fur is silky & they are so happy & healthy.<br /><br />Use the food cost calculator. your dog eats less of this than many of the garbage filled brands. They also offer coupons on their web site. It really isn't that expensive.<br /><br />If you have cats we have switched ours to the felidae and can also highly recommend it.

review/summary: Made My Dog Sick!!
review/text: I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just "something she picked up," but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!

review/summary: Best dog food!
review/text: This is by far the best dog food I've given my dog! I was having problems with my dog eating for almost a year before we started this dog food. She just wouldn't want to eat. We feed her twice a day, splitting up the daily amount. She just wasn't interested and would eat just a little bit once a day. When we switched her to this food, she has eaten her dog food (the whole amount) every day. I also read on a dog food rating website what the best dog foods were and Canidae was one of the top dog foods on the market! This makes me feel good about giving my dog something she loves and it's also very healthy. Let's just say, she has more energy than all of her doggie friends. She can play longer and harder than any of them and I know it's because I give her a quality dog food.

It even eliminated the horrible gas that large dogs are known for!

review/summary: I have a brand new dog!!
review/text: Oh my goodness...I have an 11 year old pug/beagle mix that has been lethargic for about 3 years, wouldn't really play, had a dull coat no matter how much I groomed her, and has had itchy paws and armpits for a long time. I never knew that all of that crap was in the big name brand dog foods. I had always had her on Purina of some sort until I started doing research. I was blown away by what I read and quickly became obsessed with finding a better food without paying an arm and a leg. I refuse to pay more for my dogs food than for our own food. After researching about 30 different dog foods and prices and brands on different websites, I went with Canidae All Life Stages (chicken, turkey, lamb, and fish)via Amazon with free super saver shipping for both my 11 year old Puggle and my new 10 week old labrador retriever puppy. I haven't regretted the change or the purchase at all! I am absolutely thrilled. My 11 year old isn't nearly as itchy, has a crazy shiny coat now, and has ALL KINDS of energy to keep up with the puppy now! Also, the breeder of my new lab had her on Purina Pro Plan Large Breed so I switched her right away and even her coat looks so much better now and it's only been about 3 weeks. I can't wait to see the difference in the two of them over the next 3 or 4 months. They both did get a little bit constipated during the transition period from their old foods to the Canidae, but a little bit of canola oil for a few days drizzled over their breakfast and dinner fixed that until their bodies adjusted. Both are regular now with no problems. Also, during the transition, I couldn't get either of them to eat even one piece of their old food. They would both pick out the Canidae and gobble it up and then leave their old food in the bowl until they were later famished! It was funny to watch!  Great product, great service, and will definitely continue to order the 44 lb bag via Amazon. The packaging was very very poor but that's a different issue. The box that the food was shipped in wasn't even big enough for the bag and the UPS driver brought me the food, with pieces of the box laying on top of the bag. Oh well, I'm still thrilled with the product!<br /><br />UPDATE:  SEVERAL MONTHS LATER, BOTH DOGS ARE STILL DOING FANTASTIC WITH THE CANIDAE FOOD! THE PUPPY'S COAT ACTUALLY SPARKLES LIKE I PUT GLITTER ON HER IN THE SUNLIGHT, IT'S CRAZY. THE PUGGLE IS ONLY SHEDDING A THIRD OF WHAT SHE USED TO AND THE ONLY THING THAT SHE EVER CHEWS ON IS ONE OF HER PAWS AND THE VET GAVE ME A SPRAY FOR THAT. I AM STILL THRILLED WITH THE FOOD AND WITH AMAZON'S PRICE AND THE FREE SHIPPING!

Now i wont bash any brands as some seem to do because some food seems to work with one pup and not another so dont be a jerk and think some food is crap because it didn't work out for your dog, be a good owner and look for things they like and react well to :-)..... now that being said i had a neurotic on edge dog with huge shedding issues and RR's don't shed. This food was like the miracle cure and after a year of my poor little girl trying different foods all she gets is complements on how great she looks from strangers as we walk the streets. if your used to high end prices this food is also a value seeing that you get 44#'s which does make a difference trust me. so as for us its a full five star no shedding, great coat, healthy mind and a value! don't be afraid try this if others arnt working out for your dog or even if you want your puppy to look even better.

review/summary: Canidae and Felidae
review/text: Pretty scary reading some of these reviews. I learned about the switch to new formulas from Canidae quite a while back but stuck with it. I have a German Shepard and a cat and both went through the switch just fine. What baffles me is how there can be so many great experiences listed here and then see those bad ones. I wonder if some of these innocent little dogs didn't have something else going on instead of getting bad food. Maybe it just doesn't work the same for everyone's dog. Anyway, my kids are very active for their age and doing great on Canidae and Felidae. It seems to be the best combination of high-quality ingredients and reasonable price out there. I'm a big fan and receommend both to anyone. In fact, my cat loves the new formula even more than the old. She's getting a little fat.  :-)

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: My puppy, a 14 week Bernese Mountain Dog, has a very sensitive stomach and frequent diarrhea, so she was on an expensive vet-prescribed diet for the first two weeks that I had her...eventually she needed a more growth-oriented food, so I switched her over to Eukanuba Large Breed Puppy (on the recommendation of the vet), but she still rarely had solid stools.  Also, each day, her coat seemed less shiny, she had a ton of dandruff, and scratched like crazy.  After only a week on Canidae (I'm gradually mixing more and more of it in, and decreasing the Eukanuba)-- she's stopped itching, and her poop is way more solid and far less frequent.<br /><br />I know there's no perfect pet food, but if you have a dog with a sensitive stomach and/or possible allergies (I'm thinking corn or another filler that Eukanuba and Iams uses?), Canidae could be a godsend.  It has  been for me.  Every dog deserves a better quality food than one with by-products and a ton of fillers, and some (like my pup) simply can't handle that low-quality stuff.

review/summary: Feeding it in my boarding kennel....excellent investment
review/text: Although I do not buy Canidae through Amazon, I wanted to rave about it's quality.  I am a dealer and own and operate a pet boarding facility.  I switch dogs everyday to Canidae without mixing diets due to the nature of the business and it saves me tons in labor.  The dogs not only gobble it up - they do not get upset tummies.  I have been feeding my pack of competitive working dogs (Border Collies and Australian Shepherds) for 6 years and about 30 boarding dogs per day and I have not found anything even close to the quality and value of Canidae.  Many kennels try to cut corners on feed but I believe paying a little more for Canidae has made money.  The dogs feel great, the kennels stay clean, and the owners have peace of mind. (Less poop to scoop is a big deal around here) I am a strong supporter of any feed company that puts together an all natural - excellent ingredient product and have tried many, but I'm completely sold on Canidae.

review/summary: The best for the money........
review/text: I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.

Then after a friend told me about this product I looked around a bit more and decided to give this one a try. If any of you own a pug, you know how stinky their farts could get! After eating this one for a while, my pug seems to have less flatulence problems or at least far far less smelly ones. I could also feed them a little less in order to maintain their proper weight as opposed to the other brands, it had too much filler. My pets seem to be much happier, more energetic, much healthier looking, and have less smelly farts.

review/text: I have been feeding Canidae for a long time, and when my local carrier raised their prices to $70+ without taxes, I figured I needed to start buying online.  The food quality was the same as the bags I bought in stores, and it is a great food overall.  The only issues I have had are with the delivery.  One of the bags I bought was broke open, so when I took the bag out of the shipping box, dog food went everywhere.  The delivery time is also something that needs improvement.  I placed my order on the 10th, and it didn't start to ship until the 17th.  It took a week before it even left the facility.  It is supposed to arrive a week after the 17th, which means it will have taken 2 weeks to get my delivery.  Not a big deal if you are waiting on something frivalous, but food for you pets should be delivered more quickly.

In addition the "Grain Free" caught my eye, since I was contemplating going to a raw diet.  From my research the Canidae "Grain Free" formula is as close as you can get to "natural" diet without committing to raw food.  Great product and my dogs love it.. Now I must admit there will be flatulence, and it can be rough at times... (Ha!, Ha!). But the overall health and well fare of the dog is my main concern....

review/summary: Best dog food ever!
review/text: I know my review is a little out dated from its earlier posts but, I love this food for my 2 labs.  I have never fed them anything else. I am giving it 4 stars due to the increase in price and decrease in size. I used to by it when it was a 40 lb bag for $38 or so.  Now it is 35lb bag and $42, atleast in my neck of the woods.  I know you can buy a 44lb bag, but that doesn't fit in my container.<br /><br />I started feeding this about 10 years ago to one of my other labs because he had cancer and I wanted to give him the best nutrition possible with out breaking the bank.  He thrived on this food.  He has since passed and now I have 2 more labs.  My labs are 7 and 5, and I have not heard of any change in formula, nor have I ever fed anything else.  I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.  As far as I am concerned a little gas is fine as long as it is coming out and is not stuck inside, that is when it becomes a problem.  All mammals have gas, it is a fact of life, to think you can prevent dogs from gas is crazy!<br /><br />I feel terrible for the dog owners that had sick pets.  I hope you found an alternative that you were happy with feeding.

review/summary: Best dog food yet!
review/text: This food has made new dogs out of our two small dogs.  Their energy levels and the quality of their coats both show a marked improvement within the first two weeks.  After one year of use we notice a marked increase in general health and activity.

review/text: We have tried several other brands of compariable ingredients and this one by far is the best. Our dogs coats are very shiny with no allergy issues and our 13 yr. old lab has had issues since she was a couple of years old but with Canidae she has had no issues and she has been on it for over a year now.She had issues with TSC's new brand and Chicken Soup.Would have given 5 stars but is kinda expensive but you get what you pay for!

review/summary: canidae excellent!!!!!!!!
review/text: This dog food is the best!! Excellent price. Free shipping, and above all high grade quality ingedients. No fillers, no by products, no wheat, no corn. I have a puppy that started out looking like a beagle puppy, 3.lbs 6 oz when I got him at 8 wks. He turned out to be just barely 4 wks old and is now 45 pounds and growing. I think he is actually a coon hound. He has itchy skin so I wanted to find a product he could eat and my 13 yr old wonder dog (we wonder what he is)could also eat. Canidae is the perfect answer. Since I have been using Canidae my puppy is far less itchy and I still am at the 3 parts Canidae to one part of his other food, which was Pedigree for puppies.  My older dog is less stiff in his joints and his coat is softer too.  I am looking forward to a long time relationship with Canidae. thanks

review/text: This is a great product. It is very healthy for all of our dogs, and it is the first food that they all love to eat. It helped my older dog lose weight and my 10 year old lab gain the weight he needed to be healthy.

review/summary: Great food!!
review/text: I was so ecstatic when I purchased two 44lb bags of canidae dog food.  We have used this food for years and my dogs love it. They have  beautiful coats. On  August 15, 2011 for 41.99 each with free shipping from amazon. The actual shipper was Petcare RX. Since I am feeding 4 large dogs (including a rescue) we go through a lot of food. Its nice to have it delivered to your door. I just signed on to reorder and noticed that amazon increased the price from $41.99 to $55. In theory, there goes free shipping. They rolled it into the new cost of the food. Now, it is no cheaper for me to purchase it on amazon since my neighborhood pet store sells it for $54.00 and I don't have to order it 7-10 days ahead just to make sure I get it before our current supply runs out. SHAME ON YOU AMAZON!

review/summary: good well balanced dry food
review/text: I read lots of reviews on the internet on dry dog food, this one was highly rated for grain free.  it may be expensive but well worth the price. My standard poodle is very picky about his food, not a food hound in the least, he liked it immediately.

review/summary: Fantastic food!
review/text: My dogs have always been on a high quality diet and recently I decided to give this food a try. I was a little hesitant at first due to the price but figured my dogs were worth it. Since making the switch my rescue yellow lab has made vast improvements. No matter what she ate before, she was always itching and scratching. Especially at the base of her tail. She used to get so sore at times that she would actually bleed. Her coat and skin now are perfect!!! No more itching, scratching and chewing. All of my dogs are also eating less and maintaining their weight nicely. Less food means less waste in the yard. All in all I couldn't be happier with this food and my dogs will stay on it as long as they continue making it. I also just switched my cat over to their grain free Salmon cat food.

review/summary: Brought my German Shepard from a wonderful breeder and they highly supported Canidae.
review/text: I asked the breeder "why Canidae"? I never even heard of it. She told me that because German Shepards have sensitive stomachs and also prone to hip problems is why this product is so beneficial to their dogs. Ever since a puppy my dogs been on Canidae. I have tried others when I couldn't find Canadie, like now and noticed a differance in various ways. I am happy to see I can now buy the product online to get my dog back on tract.

review/summary: Was a little nervous trying it, but my dog does well on it
review/text: I was a bit nervous trying this kibble after reading all the negative reviews, but I decided to give it a go since it's one of the only reasonably priced wheat & corn free "premium" kibbles available where I live.<br /><br />The ingredients list looked respectable (first 3 ingredients are human grade meat meals), as did the nutritional information (meets AAFCO profile for All Life Stages).  Also, all the ingredients are apparently from the U.S.A, so no worries about melamine (the two recent melamine scares were from Chinese wheat gluten and Chinese milk powder).<br /><br />We're on our 3rd bag now - my girl thrives on it, and likes it.  She's hard to keep weight on, but this food is good for that as it has a very high energy content compared to most kibbles.<br /><br />I do feed partially raw & partially kibble,  not just Canidae, so perhaps that makes a difference to how well the dog does on it.  But I can honestly say I've had no problems with this kibble at all, & will keep feeding it.

review/summary: Affordable Premium Food
review/text: We adopted a mastiff mix puppy last year, and after some research, I threw away a 90% full bag of Puppy Chow because it's just not good for dogs.  We tried a mid level food (3 stars from Dog Food Reviews) and it did ok, but it was too high in protein for the giant breeds.  When we decided to get a Great Dane this spring I started looking for a food that would be good for both dogs and found this.  We tried it out and after the initial adjustment (necessary with any food) both seem to be doing well on it.  With a giant breed and a large mutt, we go through about 90 lbs a month, so I wanted something affordable but quality and this fits the bill.  In the large 44 lb bags it's usually a bit over a dollar per pound, which is comparable to the big box brands.  We were able to get our Dane to a proper weight on it and keep our mutt from chubbing up too much, so I'm very impressed.  I'd love to feed them Orijen or Taste of the Wild, but they are very cost prohibitive.  I'm glad this one fits the bill without draining my bank account.

review/summary: Made 1 and 2 dogs sick - make that 1 and half
review/text: Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well.

review/summary: WARNING!!!!
review/text: I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html

review/summary: Good food for our dogs
review/text: I see a lot of negative comments from other reviews but when I look at the ingredients, the cost, and the value, this is the best food I have found.  We have two dogs and this food does them well. I gradually switched over from Blue Buffalo who raised their prices. The Canidae is a better product in my opinion anyway.  I asked the pet supply store owner, and she said in her years despite the negative reviews, there maybe 2-3 bags have ever been returned in her store.  I'm happy with the product and price, and the dogs like it too.

review/summary: still a wonderful food
review/text: My dogs started on Canidae 3 years ago. All of them had a dramatic change in energy and coat. They have done wonderfully on the food since. There has been a lot of negative attention recently with the formula change but I have yet to have any trouble with my 4 on the new formula. They continue to eat it and do well. They had no stool problems, itchiness, vomiting that others have suggested. I am still quite pleased with Canidae and will continue to use it for all of my dogs.

review/summary: Canidae Lost Another Loyal Customer!
review/text: Canidae was the best food for my lab for the last 5 years until they changed the formula in June.  OMG...what a disaster from the very first bowl with the new formula(which I did mix with some of the old stuff to transition him).  I'm so disappointed...and no notice on the bag about the new formulation????  The old stuff worked GREAT, but I'm sure to save a few bucks, they've changed to cheaper ingredients.  Well I'm DONE.  My dog has had the worst gas and runny stools.  I now need to find a food that he can handle which is not an easy task since he's got skin allergies...and I won't buy just anything...it's got to be topnotch.  Canidae was ideal with the old formula...not so anymore...  Any suggestions out there on what I can transition to???
