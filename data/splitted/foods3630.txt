review/summary: Superior quality and fantastic customer service!
review/text: I have been purchasing these mushrooms for years by driving to specialty stores in either NYC or Philadelphia.  Even including shipping, this is the best price I have ever seen on these mushrooms! I even received an e-mail telling me shipping may be delayed due to Hurricane Wilma, But still got the product in less than a week! I paid more than double this in a famous Philadelphia cheese shop, and the quality wasn't as good as this! I will definitely be doing more business with this company!!

review/summary: An Italian Cook's Dream
review/text: Most reviewers seem to agree the quality of these mushrooms will add that special magic to any dish requiring their use. There is a decent ratio of whole mushrooms to stems. I assume the more expensive Grade 'Extra AA' offering by JR Mushrooms has more mushroom cap slices instead of so many stems.<br />As dried mushrooms have a very long shelf life buying them in bulk makes sense to anyone who like me loves to spontaneously prepare a good Porcini based Ragu Sauce, Polenta or Risotto but cringes at driving to the local supermarket to pay $6.99 an ounce for a skimpy cellophane bag of mushroom bits. This company shipped my order to the West Coast in what seemed to be overnight delivery. I will certainly be a repeat customer and will no doubt be preparing more recipes that include the wonderful flavor of dried Porcini mushrooms selected from my big gallon bag. Enjoy!

review/summary: Keep for ever, taste great, excellent quality
review/text: I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking.  Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well!  Porcini's are one of my favorite mushrooms, and JR Mushrooms brand have an excellent quality.  AB rating means they have caps and stems, and AA rating will give you get more caps.  Stems are slightly more chewer, but I like the flavor of both caps and stems.<br /><br />To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the  water boiling. Then let them cool.  If some of them are still hard I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft.  Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMAVPS">Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 Oz</a><br /><br />Mushrooms, what do they taste like:<br /><br />* PORCINI  - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut<br />* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty<br />* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn<br />* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor<br />* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos<br />* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried<br />* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor<br />* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavor<br /><br />JR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/summary: Very nice - excellent quality for price
review/text: I'm extremely happy with these dried mushrooms. The only reason I give them four stars instead of five is that they are exactly as advertised (and I can't give them 4 1/2 stars); not the best grade available but close enough for frequent uses. After soaking, the broth needs to be strained through a coffee filter to remove some grit. Not a huge thing if you expect you will need to do it, but the highest grade dried porcinis do not need it and it does change the quality of the soaking broth, especially when using red wines and/or paper filters. These are an EXCELLENT bargain for the price though. Just remember they need to be cleaned slightly before soaking and remember to strain your soaking liquid before using it in a recipe and you should be all set.

review/summary: Tastes great and a LOT of worms...
review/text: I have never cooked with porcini before and bought 16oz of these. They smell so amazing and the flavor is just wonderful! I made a soup of barley, italian sausage, and mushrooms.<br /><br />Though I must warn you... I only soaked about 1/3 of a cup of dried mushrooms and got a dime sized pile of re-hydrated worms. These things are infested! After an internet search I found that this is apparently a normal occurrence. I can't image the amount of worms I got was supposed to be normal though.<br /><br />The mushrooms were limp and looked very unappetizing on my spoon (could have been the cooking time, could have been the fact I could see the little worm paths in the mushroom), but that was some of the best tasting broth I have ever had. I think what I will do is just hydrate them and use only the strained liquid.<br /><br />I never thought I would give an ounce of respect to a food filled with worms.

For the types of dishes I make with dried porcinis, I don't think I'd ever have a need for anything more than the Extra AB grade.  I will definitely be a repeat customer, considering the low price and speedy shipping!

review/summary: Porcini Mushrooms - Great Quality
review/text: For Christmas this year I planned to make three glass gift containers with Arborio rice on the bottom and porcini mushrooms on top.  The recipe called for 5 ounces of mushrooms.  The local grocery store wanted a ridiculous price of $7.00 for one ounce, so I shopped on-line and found these.  I just received my one pound bag for much less than the grocery store price, and the mushrooms are of very good quality.  It only took a couple of days for the shipment to arrive.  Now I can proceed with my Christmas gift idea!  Thank you!!

review/summary: Excellent product for the price
review/text: The best price I have found for real porcinis from Italy. (Shoppers beware: when sellers don't ID the country of origin, the mushrooms are usually from Eastern Europe or China.) The "AB" grade is cheaper because it contains a higher percentage of stems, but that doesn't harm the flavor, which is excellent. Some reviewers have complained that these mushrooms "don't rehydrate," but they do--it's just that the slices are thicker than average, so it takes a little longer. Shipping was very fast, and the product arrived ahead of schedule. Overall, I am very pleased and would buy from this seller again.

review/summary: Porcini Extra AB grade mushrooms
review/text: Excellent mushrooms and highly recommended.  We only made mushroom and barley soup from it and it is always excellent and smells great!  But in retrospect (and that's just my own fault) I should have bought "Super Premium AA" grade instead of "Extra AB" as the pieces were kind of small.  Next time I'll buy AA.  Because of the size of the pieces, the lower AB grade is not worthwhile sauteing while I'm quite sure AA will be good enough for it. So, don't be too cheap.  Still the quality is excellent and the mushrooms are highly recommended.

review/summary: Our pantry staple!
review/text: I first tried these last year and absolutely fell in love. The only fresh mushrooms we can get here are the very basics so to add these is heavenly.<br /><br />Soups, stews, egg dishes, gravies, meatloaf, these mushrooms make just about everything taste better!<br /><br />And it's so easy. I rinse them quickly before letting them soak as I'm a bit lazy and didn't want to filter the liquid as they recommend on their website. I've never had any problem. I use the liquid as well, and if I don't use it in that recipe, I save it for another! It's that good!<br /><br />I cheat and use my Keurig to soak them in a 4 cup vessel with 2 of the large size cups. Perfect every time. I usually grab two very large handfuls of the porcinis to reconstitute.<br /><br />Beware:<br />I accidentally ordered from the wrong vendor a few days ago and got a huge bag of... literally - garbage. It smelled so odd, was discolored (dyed?) and just gross. I can only think it was the victim of some warehouse flood or something. Amazon refunded my money and I ordered from here again and just got the most fragrant, delicious mushrooms. I'll never make that mistake again!<br /><br />Please enjoy these - they are wonderful and I'm so glad I can get them from Amazon!

review/summary: Elevates food to a whole new level
review/text: I have always been a big fan of mushrooms, but had never cooked with porcini mushrooms before ordering these Grade Extra AB mushrooms from JR Mushrooms.<br /><br />These mushrooms are wonderful!  They make everything from oven roasted prime rib to braised chicken to stuffed portobello mushroom caps taste so much better.  I served my father what would have otherwise been a boring braised chicken dish, and he said it was one of the best things he ever ate.<br /><br />16 Oz of dried porcini mushrooms is a lot, and after seeing how big the bag is, I feel this purchase was a great deal.  I will be ordering another bag soon since I am finding all sorts of ways to incorporate porcini mushrooms into my food.  My one complaint is that they did not come in a nice resealable bag.  However, this is not enough for me to deduct a star.<br /><br />If you are looking to elevate your food to the next level, try using these mushrooms.

Be sure to keep the reconstituting liquid, it's amazing mushroom stock!

Their website shows you can store these for a year in a cool place like the refrigerator so I know they'll keep for awhile.  Thanks for the quick shipment.  I hope to be trying these in other dishes also.  Three stars only because I wasn't happy with this seller's customer service department on not acknowledging an email on a different order.

review/summary: Great stuff!!!
review/text: I give it 5 stars because it has more greens and fruits in it than the other one, Odwall green machine superfood. It tastes better...more refreshing and not too thick.  I used to drink the Odwalla but then I saw this at Sam's Club.  They sell the biggest bottle for $6.99 here in Hawaii.  I was skeptical at first coz I wasn't sure if it would taste as good as Odwalla.  To my surprise it does taste so much better!  My 15-month little boy loves this stuff.  He is very picky with his food and he doesn't want to eat any veggies at all.  Some recommend that I stuff a meatball with broccoli and feed him this but I'm thinking, OK, does that little tiny piece of broccoli in the meatball really make an impact on his nutrition?  By the time it gets cooked, the nutrients are gone! Hello! So I tried giving him this after he eats his meal and I'm comforted that I'm giving him a well-balanced meal.  I think it's not fair to give this product 1 star because it is not a rating for the product itself but for the store above that sells this.

review/text: I'm on my third 32-ounce bottle in three days. You could almost live completely off this stuff. It looks green, yes, and everyone should really try it first with a blindfold on; the green somehow throws you off, you expect it to be gross, but it's sweet and fresh and filling. Not too thick, not too thin, delicious and so truly good for you. Spirlina is a pheominal nutrient/mineral rich food and it's in here and very expensive in the healthfood stores to buy seperately. I taste mostly pinnaple flavor in it, my step-son tastes mostly kiwi. It's vegan and kosher and made without any preservatives, colors, or GMO foods. I love it. My head feels clear, I feel calm and healthy drinking it. This is taking over my AM coffee for me. Much cheaper in the stores than advertised here currently. Enjoy, it's really really good for you.<br /><br />From their website on the product:--<br /><br />[Green Machine: apple and pear juice blend, pineapple juice, mango puree, kiwifruit puree, banana puree with powdered spirulina, chlorella, brocolli, green tea extract, spinach, barley grass, wheat grass, blue green algae, echinacea purpurea extract, odorless garlic!

I couldn't even bring myself to hardly swallow the sip I took. It tastes just like ketchup to me (which could be why my boys like because they are ketchup addicts). I tried another sip after I found out they both liked it just to make sure I didn't get a bad sip (if that's possible - lol). Nope, still don't like it. I like most healthy fruit and veggie smoothies and shakes but just not this one. I gave this two stars because my boys liked it and it's good for you. I will not be drinking it again though.

review/text: I like to keep crunchy snacks that aren't sweet and are relatively healthful in the office for the afternoon munchies. These are GREAT - not too salty or greasy, and not overly fattening. Serving size is 1/4 of a bag, roughly, and they're actually quite filling. Some MSG, butthat's about the only "red flag" ingredient (well, okay - I'd prefer olive oil to corn oil, but at least there's no corn syrup, and the first ingredient is green peas!)

review/text: saya baked snow pea crisps chips are a wonderful alternative to regular chip snacks. the taste is incredibly crunchy, and downright addictive- yet, also incredibly light... children and adults alike will enjoy these tasty snacks- they are BAKED NOT FRIED, which means they are not near as high in fats as regular chips, and they taste even better! (only downside is that there is some MSG in these... but really, who knows what's actually in those greasy chips in your kitchen right now)- my advice is to try these wonderful snow pea chips- you won't want to go back to your regular (unhealthy greasy high fat) chips after you've tasted something so much better- and it just so happens that these baked snow pea snacks are better for you as well- who knew a lower fat snack could taste this good! ;0)

review/text: Like so many food and supplement items ordered from Amazon in the past, these cookies arrived with a very short expiration date (1 month expiration date on a six-pak of cookies). In the past, Amazon would make good on the expired or almost expired goods even though their policy is "no returns on food". This time however, I found it impossible to contact anyone at Amazon to help in an exchange. Looks like they've made it even harder to get customer service on these types of issues. All that said, these are the best tasting vanilla wafers in my opinion. Sort of a combination of a sugar cookie and a typical vanilla wafer. Very nice vanilla flavor with a hearty crunch.

review/summary: Well done California!
review/text: This is a really delicious cheese. The interior is about the consistency of a hard cheddar, maybe a little more crumbly, and suitable for cutting into snack size pieces. The description says it's somewhat like cheddar, but I find it more like a softer parmigiano, with a nutty sweetness along with the sharpness. Very nice with nuts and dates. It gets harder toward the outside, and works very well for grating like a hard parmigiano. The outermost part is quite hard.  I haven't tried to melt it, but it is delicious grated or shaved onto pasta dishes, salads and even into egg dishes.  I wish I could find it in our local upscale cheese shops - it's funny to me that while many of our restaurants are trying to use more local and California products, with cheese it seems to be that the farther away and more obscure the better. Too bad this comes from boring old Modesto, not some virgin-tended cave on an uncharted island off Sardinia.

review/text: San Joaquin gold is an aged, semi-hard raw milk cheese in the style of Fontina. harder and nuttier towards the rind, reminiscent of a good Parmesiano Reggiano, and softer and buttery towards the center. It pleasantly doesn't have the crunchy graininess of a lot of raw milk cheeses. As far as I'm concerned it's unbeatable as a snacking cheese, and I hear it melts and grates well too.

review/text: I grew up in New England.  We had Cake Mate sprinkles or jimmies.  They are made in Florida by Signature Foods. I still get them when I go back as they are in the grocery stores.  The CK ones are okay, and I thought they would be quite similar -- same bad hydrogenated oils and the reviews.  These are certainly fine for a cupcake.  But for ice cream or the occasional spoonful of sprinkles, you need the Cake Mate.  These are available in 32 oz. from spiceworld online.  They are listed on Amazon but not as currently available.  I plan to get some soon.

review/text: Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!

review/summary: Possibly my Favorite K-Cup
review/text: I recently purchased Tully's Full City Roast, as well as Tully's House Blend.  They are both excellent, but personally, I prefer the House Blend by a small margin.  I like several of the extra bold k-cups, especially Gloria Jean's Black Gold, Timothy's Rainforest Espresso and Midnight Magic, and Coffee People Donut Shop.  But I find the Tully's House Blend to have a great mix of being rich and flavorful, but still very drinkable anytime.  It may be my favorite k-cup right now, and I will definitely keep a stock of it around our house.

review/summary: I'm a Tully's Fan! The House Blend Is Becoming One Of My Favorites.
review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Bold But Not Extra Bold.  Smooth, Flavorful & Not Bitter..
review/text: Tully's House Blend falls squarely into the Bold category, but it is definitely not an Extra Bold coffee.  It is smooth, flavorful and does not have a bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />**** For those medium blend coffee drinkers, this blend may be too strong.  For those that like a jolt in the morning, this coffee may not be bold enough. ****<br /><br />This blend, taste-wise, is not quite as full-bodied as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M62D5S">Tully's Italian Roast, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> yet it is bolder than the Kona blends, which are no longer available.  I also find that it has a just a little more kick than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GVA4">Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>, which is one of my favorite blends to-date.

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

review/summary: Full of Rich Flavor
review/text: I've been drinking bold flavors such as Timothy's Rain Forest Expresso and Coffee People's Wake Up Call but have grown tired of the somewhat chalky taste of both.  I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I first tasted this at my uncle's house on Christmas morning, after he got a Keurig and hooked it up for everyone's enjoyment.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt, that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted. It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/summary: Starbucks is great, but Tully's is THE BEST!
review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!
