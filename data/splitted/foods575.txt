review/summary: Crunchy and delicious plus its a low calorie treat!
review/text: A Korean co-worker introduced the medical department to these over the summer. They were an instant hit. Crispy light rice crackers that have a fine sprinkling of seasonings over the tops. You can not eat just one. They are absolutely addicting. Not only are they delicious, they are low calorie as well. So even if you can't stop eating them, they are almost a guilt free snack. I promise, if you try them, you'll love them as much as we do :) I mean, afterall, I bought a case of them!

review/summary: Very good but a nutrional neutral or negative depending on your view
review/text: First, $1.00 per pack is an excellent value. Each pack contains 12 little sachets of two crackers each. The nutritional value listed about the crackers is for four of these little sachets (8 crackers) so each packet has three servings. The taste is good, if neutral, but I like neutral taste in a cracker so you can dip it or dress it as you wish with little interference from the cracker. The taste is not sweet (surprising since the 2nd ingredient is sugar) but 1s ever so VERY slightly of soy/sweet....very lightly salty/sweet....altogether quite nice.  Each cracker is substantial enough to carry any heavy dip without breaking. The sodium is 125 mg. and the sugar is 3g for each 8 cracker serving. All the nutritional info is listed here on Amazon, just thought I'd mention those after the salty/sweet remark.....<br />Altogether I am happy with the purchase but will probably donate about 1/2 the crate of 30 packages to a local food bank.<br />I can recommend these for a nice change of crackers. If you opened a bunch of the little sachets and put them on a platter they'd be great for a party. f.y.i., each cracker is approx. 2 3/4" long and 2" wide.<br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Our favorite snack but no longer a good deal
review/text: These crackers are my daughter's favorite snack. She got them first in goodie bags from Asian children in her class. Then a Chinese friend started bringing them to her. Now, I am a regular at the Asian grocery store in town, primarily to buy these. My daughter does not eat a lot of sweets but takes a package of these in her lunch every day. I keep a bag in the car since they are snacks that don't need refrigeration and my kids are starved when I pick them up. The Amazon price is a little cheaper than what I pay at the Asian grocery and is a lot less than they are at our regular grocery store. Plus, I won't have them looking at me oddly for buying 8 bags at a time.<br /><br />January 2009 - I just went to order more and found that they no longer ship from Amazon and shipping is over $10. I will now be buying them locally since at the old price, they were almost the same as the Asian grocery but were more convenient. With shipping, Amazon is not a good choice.

review/summary: 85% Juice with added water and sugar
review/text: I like this product okay, but would rather have pure coconut water (like the Nirvana brand, etc.).  I asked around and looked around, but couldn't find anything on its ingredient list.  Being that it was by far the cheapest option on Amazon for coconut water, I jumped on a case.  It tastes pretty good, but pretty sweet too.  If that's your thing, than you'll love it.  However, I was disappointed by the ingredients list: young coconut juice, water, young coconut pulp, sugar, sodium metabisulphite (for color retention).  It tastes reminiscent of sugar water with a coconut background.  By comparison the Nirvana product I've been buying (pure coconut water) has 15 g of sugar / 16 oz. or about 1 g/oz.  Parrot has 24 g / 11.5 oz. or about 2 g/oz.  In other words, they've doubled the sugar content of an already sweet beverage.  24 g of sugar is still substantially less than a can of pop though at 40-60 g.  So if you're looking for a sweet beverage to replace a can of pop for you or someone else, this could be a good option, but I think the natural coconut water is sweet enough and didn't need alteration.  The addition of sugar water is probably what decreases the price to create such a competitive price.  Nirvana (for example) doesn't have any added preservatives either.  You can learn more about sodium metabisulphite here:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The 16 oz Nirvana (as compared to the 11.5 oz Parrot) has the same calories, 0.5 g more fat, same carbs, 1.7 g protein (0 g for Parrot), 6% calcium (2% for Parrot), 8% vitamin C (15% for Parrot), and 6% iron (4% for Parrot).  The Nirvana product is also more expensive at $2/16 oz can vs. 0.50 cents/11.5 oz can for Parrot.  About 11cents for Nirvana or 4.5cents per oz for Parrot.  So it depends on what is affordable for you.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful!

review/summary: Good dog food
review/text: So I went to a local pet store in town that carries a LOT of dog food. When I stepped inside, I had no idea what I was looking for or what the difference was between hundreds of different dog foods. So a helpful employee gave me some tips. He explained to me that the 'low quality' dog foods, like science diet, purina, kibbles n bits, etc. contain a lot of fillers. That is, ingredients that provide no nutritional value to the dog. Translation = WAY more poop to pick up. Then there is the mid-grade dog food, like Nutrisource, that contains fewer fillers. That means the dog eats less, poops less, and is getting better nutrition from his food. I checked the labels of probably 15 different foods and this nutrisource brand looked like it had the best value. Yes, it's more expensive than your lower quality stuff, but the dog will also eat less of it. When my dog was on purina, he was eating about 3.5 cups a day. Since switching to nutrisource, he eats about 2.5 cups. So in the end, this better quality food is not a whole lot more expensive. I know it's unplesant to think about, but I should mention that since switching to nutrisouce, my dog farts a lot less and his poop stinks a lot less too, a very nice bonus for the responsible dog owner who needs to pick it all up.<br /><br />I would recommend this food for any large breed dog. My dog is 70 lbs, german sheppard/chow mix. The "large bites" food should be used for any dog over 35 lbs or so, as the chewing will also help keep their teeth clean!

review/summary: My kids love it, and I sneak spoonsful too
review/text: I know Nutella has been around a long time in Europe, but we just recently discovered it.  I bought a tiny, expensive jar from the grocery store and it was gone in two days.  When I found these large (26 oz) jars sold in a two-pack from Amazon (free with SuperSaver shipping!) I bought several.  I pack our lunches every day, and I'm always looking for something other than lunch meat, PB&J or leftovers.<br /><br />From a Mom's standpoint, I like Nutella because it contains hazelnuts, and doesn't contain preservatives, artificial flavors or anything too suspicious.  It does contain a lot of sugar, but if I use whole wheat bread for their sandwiches I don't feel that it's junk food.  I wish they would make a low-sugar Nutella.  I noticed that Amazon has several Nutella offerings, some of them made in Europe with the traditional (less sugary) recipe.<br /><br />The kids love Nutella because it's chocolaty and sweet.  They like it on apple slices and also just as a sandwich without additional peanut butter or jelly.

review/text: Two jars of Nutella arrived in the box, bound together by some shrink-wrapped plastic (that looked like it was from the factory)  After cutting them apart and opening one jar, I found the foil seal was broken.  I don't know if this was from the jars being compressed during shipping, or changes in air pressure during shipment, but it does give one pause when a food product doesn't have all the safeguards intact.<br /><br />Now for the product itself, the Chocolate Hazelnut flavor is the bomb.  It tastes like a nutty chocolate frosting, only smoother and creamier.  You could use this for toast, on top of brownies, or my favorite, on graham crackers with a glass of milk.<br /><br />The product I give a 5.  But, the since the seal was broken on one of the jars, I reluctantly gave a 3-star review overall.  Another reviewer had the same issue and gave the product a 1 rating.  I suspect it has to do with handling during shipping, but still the packaging should be able to take it.<br /><br />Good product, however the adhesive on the foil-sealed top needs to be made more robust.  BTW, don't buy this product if you're on a diet. It's soooo good, you'll find yourself spooning it out of the jar.

review/summary: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G AWESOME
review/text: I've known about Nutella for a while now but never was able to bring myself to purchase a bottle because it is so expensive. So, as I was checking out at Wal-mart one day, I happened to glance over by the gum and oh my, there's a Nutella to go. It had breadsticks with it. And it was $1.50. So, being curious, I purchased it. OH MY WORD! In my book, it's better than chocolate. It's SO worth the price. However, it's not good to eat if you're on a diet. There's nothing healthy about it. I suppose that's why it's amazing awesome!

review/summary: Nutella is amazing.
review/text: I just want to say that I'm eating Nutella right now, and it's nothing short of amazing. You pay about the same as a jar of peanut butter (another favorite of mine), and you get the equivolent of that stuff inside those gold foil ferrero chocolate things. I'm a runner for the University of Pittsburgh, and it's the one thing I never forget to bring to meets. Don't get too much of it if you're prone to gaining weight, however. While it's really good, it has 11 grams of fat per every 27 grams of nutella, making it over a third pure fat. If you're already fat, and you know that those Subway walks aren't going to make you into the next Jared, however, get some of this stuff. It's like Ben and Jerry's, only spreadable.

review/text: Nice how they leave out telling you this product has artificial flavor. Artificial flavor is lab created "flavor" tested on lab rats to ensure they get addicted and keep eating. Yet this product proudly proclaims no artificial colors or preservatives to mislead that this is somehow natural.<br /><br />Don't be duped by processed foods containing artificial flavors. You can wonder why so many folks are addicted to junk food all containing artificial flavor.

review/summary: Tangy, Fizzy Raspberry Lime Satisfaction
review/text: I am a big water drinker.  Especially bubbly water.  It satisfies the craving for bubbles.  I do not drink sodas anymore, but I still crave the fizz.  Carbonated water is what it takes to satisfy that craving.<br /><br />Sometimes I drink the water without flavors, but I do prefer flavors.<br /><br />Raspberry Lime is the most wonderful, tangy flavor.  My tastebuds love it.<br /><br />That awesome rush of fizz, the tangy flavor raspberry/lime.  This satisfies my need.<br /><br />And these come in the convenience of 12 oz cans.<br /><br />To me, these are even better than sodas.  They satisfy the fizz addiction (which sodas can also do), plus they also satisfy thirst (which sodas cannot do if you are really thirsty).  And these have no sugar (not even artificial), so they are better than sodas in that way also.<br /><br />I can drink these at home when I'm thirsty, or at my desk (be careful not to spill on any papers or computer or anything else), and they are also good for trips, the park, vacations, and they are also good with meals.  I enjoy these with the vegan sandwiches at my favorite restaurant (when I get them to go).

review/summary: Healthy Substitute for Soda
review/text: Now that research came out this week that drinking diet sodas daily increase heart attacks and strokes, this raspberry lime seltzer is a tasty substitute.  It has the same carbonation of soda with zero calories, zero artificial ingredients and chemicals.<br /><br />I'm weaning myself off the soda and switching to this.  Sometimes I mix it with a splash of berry juice, lemon juice<br />or orange juice.  It's also great with cranberry and pineapple juice.  I put it in smoothies ( one cup frozen berries, 1/2 c plain lowfat yogurt, one banana, 1/2 c berry juice and 1/2 c seltzer) and it keeps the sugar and calorie count down as most of the calories are in the fruit juice.  The polar seltzer gives the smoothie some pizzazz.<br /><br />I don't really miss the diet sodas with the variety of healthy, almost no-calorie juice drinks I can make with this.

Having said that, remember this is not a vitamin or mineral -- BREWER'S YEAST is one of the ultimate super-foods, a veritable food supplement by itself. Traditionally, people who have been involved with weight lifting, body building or competitive sports that require strength, and muscle building have found that Brewer's Yeast had preceded them. It has very well balanced amino-acids plus all the B-complex vitamins which include large doses of Inositol and Choline. Add to this, the best, and most bioavailable source of chromium and selenium too, as well as many trace minerals and elements. AND - they're all naturally occurring -- nothing is added, no preservatives, sugars or additives of any kind. Really good food is what this Brewer's Yeast is, and you can add it to many things. Right now, I have a tablespoon mixed in with a huge glass of very diluted orange juice, but you can put it in anything you want, including; casseroles, yogurt, soup, juices, meat loaf, salads, milk and of course water. Honestly, I have been using this stuff on myself for over 40 years. Truly, I've never gotten over the wonder of how well, and alert Brewer's Yeast has always made me feel. My guess is that the large quantities of Inositol and Choline are the key to the alertness, combined with the natural amino-acids.<br /><br />BELOW IS A COPY OF THE LABELING INFO THAT IS PROBABLY EASIER TO READ -- remember, all the nutrients are naturally occurring - nothing is added!<br /><br />Supplement Facts<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 heaping tablespoonful (16 g)<br /><br />Servings per container: 31<br /><br />Amount Per Serving % Daily Value<br /><br />Calories 35<br /><br />Protein 8 g 16%<br /><br />Thiamin 1.4 mg 93%<br /><br />Riboflavin 0.7 mg 41%<br /><br />Niacin 5.3 mg 27%<br /><br />Vitamin B6 0.6 mg 30%<br /><br />Folic Acid 240 mcg 60%<br /><br />Vitamin B12 2 mcg 33%<br /><br />Biotin 16 mcg 5%<br /><br />Pantothenic Acid 0.4 mg 4%<br /><br />Calcium 59 mg 6%<br /><br />Iron 1.5 mg 8%<br /><br />Phosphorus 234 mg 23%<br /><br />Magnesium 33 mg 8%<br /><br />Zinc 1.2 mg 8%<br /><br />Copper 0.5 mg 25%<br /><br />Manganese 0.13 mg 7%<br /><br />Chromium 60 mcg 50%<br /><br />Sodium 60 mg 3%<br /><br />Potassium 222 mg 6%<br /><br />Alanine 592 mg *<br /><br />Arginine 464 mg *<br /><br />Aspartic Acid 800 mg *<br /><br />Glutamic Acid 1120 mg *<br /><br />Glycine 400 mg *<br /><br />Histidine 208 mg *<br /><br />Isoleucine2,3 400 mg *<br /><br />Cystine 112 mg *<br /><br />Leucine2,3 624 mg *<br /><br />Lysine' 592 mg *<br /><br />Methionine' 144 mg *<br /><br />Phenylalanine' 368 mg *<br /><br />Proline 400 mg *<br /><br />Threonine' 400 mg *<br /><br />Serine 448 mg *<br /><br />Tryptophan1,2 96 mg *<br /><br />Tyrosine 304 mg *<br /><br />Valine2,3 480 mg *<br /><br />'The L-Tryptophan in the product is naturally present in the protein.

Many people believe that thiamine repels fleas.  This has not been proved.  However, since the cats like the yeast, they get in on their food.  One 18 ounce bottle seems to last forever.  Also, they do not have fleas.

review/summary: Do Your Research...
review/text: It is appalling to read some of the misinformation on this product especially the one with the highest helpful score by Heather L. Parisi "Robert and Heather Parisi"... Parisi has written the same review for Swanson as well as Twinlab. Twinlab has not even specified the chromium and selenium even on their Internet site and the nutritional value is not even presented clearly at all. A good Brewer's Yeast should provide the needed information not only on their Internet site but on the package labelling...<br /><br />1. Brewer's yeast does not contain vitamin B12, an essential vitamin found in meat and dairy products. Vegetarians sometimes take brewer's yeast mistakenly believing that it provides B12, which can be lacking in their diet. One tablespoon of Spirulina offers 67% vitamin B12 in comparison to 2% in brewer's yeast. Regardless, I get my B12 from sardines, sprats and salmon.<br />2. Unlike ordinary brewer's yeast, which is grown on grain and hops liquor, brewer's yeast which is called nutritional yeast is derived from the  sugar beets not hops, barley or grain.<br />3. A good brewer's yeast should be unbleached, untreated, not fortified, not blended, non GMO, nothing added and specify 100% brewer's yeast.<br />4. One tablespoon of brewer's yeast (15gr) provides me with 70% chromium and 45% selenium. I am into very healthy diet and different sports from mountain biking, surfing, weight lifting, hiking, etc. without any need for any meds for any chronic condition. Although I get selenium from Brazil Nuts, chromium is hard to get due to the depletion of the nutrients in soil. Brewer's yeast offers me other benefits like keeping glucose down, healthy skin especially when I am exposed to the sun without any sun protection since I want to get my vitamin D naturally, increasing HDL and lowering LDL, vitamin B complex and some vegetable protein.<br />5. Protein in brewer's yeast is a vegetable protein and not as complete in amino acids as the protein in dairy product like eggs, milk, cheese and yogurt. Quinoa offers me more complete protein for less money. I consume unflavored Whey Protein Isolate for weight lifting even though I consume fish and dairy products but no beef or chicken.

review/text: **4.5  STARS**<br /><br />Really like these chips because they are thin and crisp and unlike some down-market variations they have a lot of BBQ taste.<br /><br />Another advantage is that because there is so much flavor I'm not tempted to indulge in 'evil' dips that contain hundreds of fat-ladden calories per tablespoon.  (not that I'm on a diet or anything.  Which I am)<br /><br />A nice choice for an extravagant break from carrot sticks.

review/summary: One of the worlds finest waters
review/text: Volvic has no equal amongst water on the market. It is pricey but if you are able to taste the difference in water taste this will put a smile on your face and a smile from your body as you drink it. Volvic comes from france with a perfect balance of mineral flavors. I have difficulty drinking straight water as most bottled water has no taste and is just wet like poland spring. I can drink volumes of volvic water easily due to the great refreshing taste. I cannot do that with tasteless water like poland spring and fiji waters. Fiji is also expensive but it is just a fancy bottle with tasteless water. Cost does not guarantee quality taste. If you have never experienced the taste of a good water you will if you try this. Always chill volvic for best results before drinking in the bottle it came in. Addition of ice not originated from volvic may alter the taste. The flavor of good water comes from the mineral content and volvic has a perfect blend. Enjoy<br />P.s. You can find it cheaper at whole foods

review/text: Know how noodle cups get soggy and are too salty and just get gross after 5 minutes? This stuff is amazing. So tasty that I'm reviewing a noodle cup on Amazon. The noodles are clear, which is a little off-putting at first, but they are firm and very filling. The noodles don't become soggy (even after 45 minutes or so, incidentally), and the seasoning cake is wonderful-- little savory bits of seitan tofu and bok choy that expands to add lovely color and texture. The broth is delicious and umami, without being fishy. The sesame paste packet adds nutty depth. 5 stars.

If you only like the cherry these are the best to get for the price and they are exact in taste. Enjoy

review/summary: SO much tastier than the little Jolly Ranchers
review/text: I have a major sweet tooth, but I had never really cared for the traditional little Jolly Rancher candies.  One day, a coworker brought in some cherry Stix, I tried one, and I was in heaven.  To me, they have quite a different taste from the small candies; I find them to be much sweeter and tastier.  I couldn't find the Stix in any grocery stores or drugstores, so I ordered them on Amazon.  These things are so delicious, and I'm embarrassed to think about how quickly I was able to plow through a whole box.  At 70 calories a stick, just a few can add up quickly.  I haven't reordered them in a while, because these are just too good to have only one.<br /><br />Before unwrapping one of the Stix, I would snap it in about four places to get it into (still pretty long) bite-size pieces.  It's better to do this with the wrapper on, because snapping the stick will cause a few tiny "crumbs" to break off.  You can also expect most Stix to have a bit of wrapper stuck to them.  But the bit of time spent peeling it off is well worth it for all the sugary deliciousness!

review/summary: Excellent for All Baking Needs
review/text: I ran out of this baking spray recently and really missed the convenience of a flour and oil in one spray can. It is definitely more work to butter and flour a pan as I had to a few days ago when making brownies. This spray is great when making muffins or cakes. I also use it when making banana bread. So lots of uses and something that is perfect for all your baking needs. One trick when using this is to put the baking pan you are using onto the top rack of your dishwasher. Then you can spray away without getting the spray all over your counter or stove top.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

We've had it dairy-free, and loved it, have mixed in some fresh black pepper (yum), sprinkled coarse salt and rosemary on top, mixed in grated cheese....and watched the biscuits vanish. My two sons love these, gluten eating friends and family are appreciative. The company is very responsive, also, to questions. Lovely company, lovely product.

review/summary: Not successful with this mix
review/text: I made the buttermilk version and followed directions to the letter, except that I rolled them thinner than the box said.  I didn't notice until after I'd cut them out that it said to roll out the dough to 1-1/2" thickness, and I think mine were about 1/2" thick.  So it may have been my fault, but the finished biscuits were flat, chewy and very dense (almost like a cookie).  I would think they should have risen a LITTLE more than that, even if rolled too thin.  Also, I would recommend SALTED butter rather than unsalted -- they definitely needed more salt.  Another thing -- unless you have a food processor with a very large bowl, don't try to do these in the processor.  My machine is about a 3 cup capacity and it just wasn't breaking up the butter, so I had to dump it all into a bowl and make them by hand.  What a mess!

As a family that enjoys onion burgers and slow-cooker pot roasts, I had to find a way to purchase Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  With subscribe and save I can get the "real deal" Lipton brand just as cheap as store brands.  Very happy to have found this on Amazon.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: This stuff is essential to have on hand when making a roast or pretty much anything in a slow cooker!<br /><br />Sometimes, it's hard to find in local grocery stores.  This six pack is priced right and it's enough to give you a good lil stock so that you never run out!

review/summary: Onion soup mix...
review/text: What can I say about this. I have never made soup from it... It is great for dips, seasoning, meatloaf, burgers etc. probably OK for soup as well. I just wish it had a slightly lower salt content, a bit on the salty side for me.

review/summary: Swiss army knife of kitchen seasonings
review/text: There are very few things in the kitchen (aside from baked goods) that can't be helped with a packet of Lipton Onion Soup Mix.  I was reminded of this when I made onion soup burgers and onion potatoes for dinner last night.  What a pair of classics!  If I weren't watching my waistline, I wouldn't have leftovers for lunch!  This is also brilliant with pot roast, mixed into sour cream as a dip, and I even once mixed into chili.  It's never done me wrong.<br /><br />The one downside: the salt content.  If you are at all prone to bloating from salty foods, avoid this seasoning!  It's no worse of an offender than any other prepackaged seasoning, but I can't imagine anyone attempting to use this as a soup due to the salt content.

review/summary: Perfect for everything but soup
review/text: Lipton even kind of realizes that it isn't really to be used for onion soup, what with the "recipe secrets" branding and all. Because one ends up with a lot of it, when buying from in bulk packs I did once try it as a soup and it was awful, but as a recipe helper it really is hard to beat.<br /><br />As a helpful hint you can save yourself sometime and just open all the packs into a resealable container, and just use it as a spice. A lot of recipes can benefit from it, but not necessarily an entire packet.

review/summary: Great deal on a good product.
review/text: I have no super tasting skills so in my opinion all onion recipe mixes taste pretty much the same. I have no brand loyalty on onion mixes and I bought this one strictly because it is a much better deal than what I am getting at my local grocery store. These things are normally ~$2.50 a box at the store, but sometimes can go on sale for less than than $1.50, but that still doesn't really beat the $8 for 6 price amazon gave me.<br />I use these things to flavor lots of items including but not limited to: chili, hamburgers, meat balls, stews, and roasts.<br />Overall, five stars for the amazing price.

review/summary: Good staple to have on hand
review/text: I use this all the time for various things. The smaller sized cans are nice to be able to add a little protein in to a dish and not worry about having part of it left in the fridge. One can makes a nice serving of chicken salad for a sandwich, only takes a couple minutes to whip it up.
