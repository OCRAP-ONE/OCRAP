review/summary: Mint tea for two
review/text: Easy, tasty mint tea brew. For months I used k cup just for one over sized mint tea cup, but accidently used it again and found that the weaker 2nd cup was very tasty! SO I recommend getting the best value and use it 2x for yourself and it becomes twice as good. Well worth the price for the convenience and taste. :)

review/summary: Not Your Mild-Mannered Mint
review/text: I'm a big fan of mint tea - particularly peppermint.  Sadly, most mint teas are weak beverages.  In order to get a strong, clear minty flavor one has to steep tea for a long time or use more than one sachet; but not with this tea!  The Bigelow k-cups are terrific, much better than the other mint tea k-cups I've purchased in the past (Gloria's and Celestial Seasonings) in offering a bright and brisk cup of tea.  But please note: these might be a bit too vibrant for those with a more subtle palette.

review/summary: My favorite tea
review/text: I've loved this flavor of tea in the regular tea bags for a long time so naturally when I got a Keurig I had to find out if they made K-Cups. I am so happy to say that they do. It comes out perfect when I use my machine on the 10oz setting. It's very refreshing and what I especially love about it is the hint of spearmint. The mint flavor in my opinion is just right- not too overpowering, but not weak. It makes great iced tea in the summer as well. Love this stuff! A++ in my book!

review/text: I like to drink herbal tea every once in a while as a break from coffee.  I love Mint Medley tea bags, but it doesn't work so well in k-cup form.  It seems to come out very strong, so I add more hot water in (which kind of defeats the pupose)!  My Keuring brewer can only make an 8 oz. cup.  If your brewer can make a 10 or 12 oz. mug, this tea would probably be worth a try.  I'm sure personal taste preference is also a factor here.

Some may find it has too much pepper, in that case empty into a small bowl and add some relish and or Miracle Whip or Mayo. Its great with the 99 cent salad at your fav fast food place. Comes in very handy as can be eaten right from the carton with bread or crackers. You can make 2 sandwiches from one small container or one very thick sandwich. Comes two to a carton and the 2 can easily stuff a hogie roll along with lettuct and tomato and whatever other trimmings you prefer.

review/summary: GOOD SERVICEABLE OIL AT AN ATTRACTIVE PRICE.  I LIKE THIS STUFF.
review/text: I first purchased Colavita oil a few years ago out of pure desperation and lucky.  Ever have one of those days when nothing goes right?  Well my wife and I were having one of those at the time.  We had guests coming over for dinner, things were running late and as is our luck, we found we were completely out of olive oil.  We use olive oil a lot, but it was an odd occurrence.  Anyway, I rushed to a local grocery story...we were living in Virginia at the time, and being in a bit of a hurry, I grabbed the first can I came to.  This happened to be Colavita.  This was a very lucky break on my part.<br /><br />Now I cannot look you in the eye and tell you that this oil in anyway is as good as some of the premium oils we have used in the past and still use.  But what I can tell you is that for oil that is classified as a "grocery store oil," this is very nice stuff.  We still use it.  Now there are certain considerations to be noted here.  I have looked over some of the reviews and feel a need to have my little say.<br /><br />First, any olive oil that is old will taste rancid and simply will not cook well.  The same hold true for an oil that is not stored correctly.  If you use a lot of olive oil in your cooking, then you should buy a lot.  If you use it less often, then buying in bulk, or in a large amount is a sheer waste of money. This stuff will go bad on you quicker than you think.  And for goodness sakes don't store it in a clear container...that is not a good idea!<br /><br />Secondly, I noted that Cook's Illustrated recently proclaimed that "all supermarket brands" of olive oil where horrid.  While there may be some truth to this on some level, I must admit when I saw this, the first thing that flashed through my mind was "Aaaah, snob patrol in action again, slamming it to the unwashed masses."  Personally I put about as much validity in this type of report as I did in the old Play B*y magazine article from back in the early 70s that proclaimed your kidneys and liver would drop out of place if you were a runner, and that you should stop running as it was bad for your health...yeah, like I trust my health to an article like that.  Folks, you have to consider the source. Your top cooking publications are good, don't take me wrong, but a big part of their appeal is to appeal to the bit of snob that is in all of us...they write stuff like this to sell their publication and the products featured there and to make  you feel good about yourself when you make an outlandish purchase.<br /><br />Anyway, we have found this Colavita oil to be quite adequate for most use.  We do use it for cooking and it gives off a very nice nutty/earthy aroma.  It is light enough to use on most of the salad dressings we make, and we do use it extensively in the various vinaigrette and herb soaks we concoct.  I will say that we do not buy this in large quantities as you can purchase it in a very nice attractive little bottle of 17 ounces...Actually we buy it two bottles at a time, always using the older bottle first and then rotating.<br /><br />This certainly in not the only oil we use, but for everyday use we find that the quality you are getting for the price simply cannot be beat.  Not that I would ever do it, but I dare say that you could prepare a nice salad dressing with this product and tell your guests that you used some of the "really good and really expensive stuff," and that 9 out of ten would buy off on that statement.  Now don't do this because if your luck is like mine, the first one you told that to would the that one in ten I am talking about...embarrassing!<br /><br />This is good oil that will not take your last dollar to purchase.  I recommend it highly. I am comparing it to like oils in this price range, so I am giving it five stars.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/summary: Does the Job
review/text: QUALITY<br />In my opinion, having used a dozen or so brands of olive oil, Colavita is simply the best reasonably priced olive oil which is widely available.  I've been using Colavita for several years now, and have never been dissappointed.  Colavita is excellent quality, dependable, and reasonably priced---the perfect combination for a daily general purpose olive oil.<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />Although not an "olive oil gourmand", I'd describe Colavita as "rich, smooth, and neutral". Gourmands probably have other silly terms for the flavor, such as "fruity" (but a "civilian" would never call it fruity). It is not harsh or bitter like most common olive oil, not spicy like Whole Foods 360, and not notably "olivey".  Colavita is an evoo ("extra virgin olive oil"---to us non-olive oil snobs), which means "first pressing".  Most olive-oil nuts consider the words "extra virgin" to be sacred.  Practically speaking though, the mere label "extra virgin" is not a guarantee of quality---most grocery store brands (evoo or not) are harsh and bitter, but some are good cooking oils.<br /><br />PREMIUM OILS<br />Botique premium oils are are as variable year to year as wines, comparably expensive, and have to be bought the way you buy fine wine (that is, ideally at tastings, where you confirm the quality and flavor before purchase).  Some are genuinely (as in NOT-gourmet-speak) buttery and nutty---great for dipping.  Some taste like the fragrance of flowers---great for salads.  Never cook premium olive oil---use it for dipping or drizzling, or on delicate salads.  Colavita is a good general purpose oil, better than most grocery store olive oil, but is not a premium oil.<br /><br />COOKING OIL<br />Non-extra virgin olive oils (second or later pressings) are usually darker and stronger flavored---which adds complexity to soups, sauses, stews, bean dishes etc.  If you are using a  bitter or strong-tasting olive oil, cook it WITH the dish.  I add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to every sause, soup, stew, chili, cassrole, or bean dish, etc.  However, olive oil can "go bad"---so unless you use alot, it doesn't sense to use a different cooking oil than you use on salads, for dipping etc.  One usually purchases good cooking oil in multi-gallon tins.  Colavita is a very good general purpose oil, and therefore a good cooking oil---albeit a bit expensive for a cooking oil.<br /><br />DIPPING OIL<br />Traditionally (and in the best restaurants), Italian bread, oil and balsamic vinegar is served as an appetizer.  The diner usually mixes his own oil and vinegar at the table.  If all three are top quality, the combination can be delicious, and can even be a light meal.  Add figs or slices of apple or pear and some olives, and you do have a meal. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAKUP0">Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto, 5-Pound Bag</a>  Albeit probably heresy, in fact you can substitute fine wine vinegar or fresh lemon juice.  If I don't have olives, I usually add soy sause or Braggs for saltiness to the mixture. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4Y4W">Bragg Liquid Aminos, Natural Soy Sauce Alternative, 32-Ounce Bottle , (Pack of 3)</a> Colavita is a very good "everyday" dipping oil.<br /><br />SALAD OIL<br />The requirements for an "everyday" salad oil are a little less stringent than that for a dipping oil, because the heavy flavor of the vinegar, and often pamessan, bacon bits, etc. usually dominate.  However, I rarely prepare use oil and vinegar the traditional way.  For everyday salads (or as a dip for raw vegies) I prefer olive-oil based mayo with a little freshly ground pepper, and some citrus zest.  For special salads, I use a fruity premium olive oil (and just a hint of lemon and/or orange juice and zest).  Colavita is a very good "everyday" salad oil.<br /><br />DRIZZING OIL<br />A drizzling oil is an oil you pour over a dish immediately before serving, or which you serve in a carafe on the table.  If you REALLY like the flavor of "ordinary good" olive oil (I don't)---then you will find Colavita to be a good drizzling oil.  My hispanic wife frequently drizzles Colavita on the dishes I've cooked (with Colavita), because she likes the olive-oil flavor.  By the way, the same principle applies to the use of butter, pepper, garlic, cheese, even soy sause---if you want the flavor to dominate, add it just before serving; if you want the flavor to be substle, cook the seasoning with the dish.  For most dishes I prefer a rich blend of subtle flavors.<br /><br />HEALTHY COOKING<br />I go to a great deal of effort to minimize animal fat in my diet, by very strict trimming, thorough cooking, and by chilling broth to remove the solidified fat.  However, the body needs fat and craves fat.  The ideal solution is to replace animal fat with vegetable oils which are high in omega-3s.  Olive oil is ideal for the purpose.<br /><br />My Southern grandmother could not cook any vegetables without a thick slice of fatback (fatty bacon)---and indeed her vegetables were very tasty.  Speaking of which, what is the point of healthy vegetables if no-one will eat them?  The solution is to add several tablespoon fulls of olive oil, and a teaspoon of chipped ham <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NERTSE">Hormel Premium Real Crumbled Bacon</a> to the vegies.  For the best flavor, cook the vegies with the olive oil (do NOT add oil to the cooked vegetables---unless you really like the flavor of the oil).  Season as necessary with pepper and fresh lemon juice.  Truly delicious vegetables are possible---I eat them daily.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />The 34 ounce tins is about half the price of the bottle per oz at this time, but is expensive compared to the last time I purchased it.  The tins are small enough to use directly. But I prefer bottles, because controlling the flow of the oil is easier (since you can see the oil approaching the spout), and it is easier to gauge the amount of oil I'm using by eye (how far the level drops in the glass bottle). So, I refill bottles from the tins.  I've been told that olive oil stays fresher in tins (measured in months and years) That becomes relevant when you don't know how many months (or even years) a bottle may have sat on a grocery shelf.<br /><br />GENERAL RECCOMENDATION<br />After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.

review/summary: Okay
review/text: Ordered this because, at the time, I was having trouble finding this brand in a can in my local stores.  Product is pretty good and arrived with only one small dent in one of the cans and no leakage, so I guess I got lucky there.<br /><br />Since ordering, it's become available in a neighborhood store in single cans at a price only slightly higher than Amazon's, which seems a little high for two cans.  Given that, I'll buy locally from now on unless Amazon lowers price.  The oil itself is pretty good and doesn't have that "rank" taste or smell that I associate with some EV olive oils.

review/summary: excellent oil
review/text: In our home, we only use extra virgin olive oil (evoo), a little real butter, and sometimes a little coconut oil.  95% of the time, it's evoo.  For frying and other cooking uses, I keep a large container of a store brand around.  Otherwise, I use Colavita.<br /><br />From what I have tasted and researched, Colavita is a great oil.  I like to use it on my skin as well as cook with it.  It's great to drizzle on cooked food, raw food, in homemade salad dressings, dipping, or anywhere I need a "finishing" oil.  The quality and taste is there.  They say a sign of quality evoo is a "bite" or catching feeling in the back of your throat when you drink it.  After drinking Colavita straight, I will get that feeling in my throat within 2 to 5 seconds.  It shows that the good, healthy components in the evoo are still there.<br /><br />I recommend this oil as one of the best, if not the best supermarket brands of evoo.

review/text: We started using Colavita Extra Virgin olive oil years ago. it doesn't have the funny taste some reasonably priced oils have. It isn't cheap but beats all in its category. It is hard to find in the grocery stores now for some reason - Safeway affiliates try to peddle their own and it is not as good.

review/text: I go through olive oil like a mad man and Colavita is my brand.  I used to buy the glass bottles in stores that were expensive until I found these tins on Amazon.  They're very easy to open and close and the oil tastes great, in fact I would say it tastes better than from the glass.  If you're a Colavita fan or are looking for a quality olive oil brand thats not super expensive get this, you wont be sorry.

review/summary: Great Olive Oil
review/text: I'll start off with the disclaimer that neither my husband nor I are any kind of trained chef, but we do have a decent idea of what tastes good (at least to us). This olive oil is much better than anything we've used before, which is generally bought at the grocery store. Since buying it, we have made some very yummy dressings and it's great over pasta with fresh tomatoes, basil and cheese. It has a much lighter taste to it than what I'm used to as well as having a lovely nutty smell when it is heated. Lastly, we mostly decided on this product based on the price for the two tins and I think we ended up with a great item for not too much money!

review/summary: Good for cooking
review/text: I have not purchased this oil in this container format, but have purchased in a smaller format in the past.  It's a very good buy for the money, but let's be clear that it is not a "Good" olive oil.  True, it is extra virgin and cold pressed, but remember that any oil from large brands like Colavita, Bertolli, etc.. is filtered and mixed which means that it is not the way nature intended it.  My recommendation is that this is a great oil for cooking, and frying;fry an egg in Olive oil and you will never eat eggs another way again.  But if you want to make a simple greek salad for example, where olive and salt is the only dressing, you should go for the premium stuff that you'll find at your local gourmet food shop or in a meditteranean market.  My personal favorite (and yes I am biased because of my background) is Greek Olive oil from Messinia (southern peloponesus), but there are some varieties from Crete that are excellent as well.  Try to find one that is from a single source (meaning that it is not mixed with different varieties of olive oils to make a consistent taste), it's okay if your olive oil is different from one batch to the other, because that is natural.

review/summary: A Good Value And Great Coffee
review/text: Kona coffee, in general, is expensive to buy, and is generally difficult to get outside Hawaii. This Kona Blend from Boyer's Coffee is a great substitute. It is a blend, so you don't get the "pure Kona" taste, but it is good tasting coffee and very close to "real Kona". I have gone through quite a number of the 40 oz bags and have never experienced anything substandard about it. If you are looking for the heavy, bitter Starbuck's taste, this coffee is not for you. The taste is mild and the roast is appropriate to bring out the flavor of the blended coffees it contains. I will continue buying it as long as it is available. I do not perport to say this is the right coffee for everyone, because coffee, as is good Scotch, is an acquired taste and people have their preferences. I like it, as do the guests at my house. If you buy some and don't like it, send it to me. Boyer's also makes some fine flavored coffees, which my grown kids like.

And I was about to order more until I saw the RIDICULOUS price hike. Did you really think people would keep ordering it with that kind of an increase? Buh bye!

review/summary: Delicious.
review/text: I just received this coffee in the mail approximately 15 minutes ago.  Since we have been out of coffee for a whole day, I promptly pulled out my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ2GS">Aerobie 80R08 AeroPress Coffee and Espresso Maker</a> and made a cup.  When I saw the nice froth after pressing the coffee, I knew it was going to be good.  I didn't expect it to be the best cup of coffee I have had since my trip to Phil'z of San Francisco which, in my opinion, is the best coffee in the world.  At this point in time, I am willing to rank this Kona Blend as number two on my all time list of great coffee.  The coffee is smooth, mellow and lacking a bitter aftertaste (the AeroPress probably helps with that).  The beans appeared fresh and were very aromatic.  I will certainly be maintaining my 'subscribe and save' status.<br /><br />After reading the previous reviews, there are two ways in which I can conceive this coffee tasting like Folger's:<br />1) The coffee was old when the reviewer received it.  I've been ordering Boyer's coffee for a while and I've never had this happen, but I am sure it is possible.<br />2) The reviewer used a drip coffee pot.  If you are picky about coffee, do your taste buds AND the beans a favor and get a better coffee maker.<br /><br />Anyway, that is my opinion.  As a student on a graduate stipend, ~$17 for a 40oz bag of great coffee is definitely worth it.

review/summary: Terrible.
review/text: This coffee is really terrible.  My normal coffee is Kona Blend from Safeway for about $10/lb.  So, I'm not someone who has to have super over-the-top gourmet coffee.  I was just looking for the ability to purchase kona blend in bulk to save a little money.  Not this one!  I'm on my third pot now, hoping I could just deal with it enough to use up the bag ... and it looks like the answer is no.  It just tasts so bad, I'd rather have no coffee than have this.

review/summary: Stale, stale, stale!!!
review/text: I have had Kashi 7 Grain Pilaf before and it was excellent. However the pilaf I recieved from this vender tasts very stale. I looked at the expiration date on all the boxes and they are not out of date, so the case must have been stored someplace hot to make the pilaf taste almost....musty is the closest word I can use to describe the flavor.  Had to use many spices and lots of salt to make it edible! Kind of defeats the definition of Healthy to need so much salt. If there were any way to return this stuff I would!

review/text: This is a good dish just as it is but it is even better when one adds a few goodies. We typically fix it with vegetable broth rather than water. Also I sometimes add dried cranberries or chopped dried apricots.  I particularly like the texture of the pilaf. This is a substantial and chewy dish. The price at Amazon is good. Sometimes we have difficulty finding this items at our local grocery stores so finding it at Amazon was a nice surprise.

review/summary: YUMMY  FIBER
review/text: I have been eating Kashi Pilaf for at least 25 years, and use it as a rice substitute for virtually everything.  Its a little more robust in texture and flavor than brown rice, so be forewarned that finicky junk food affectionatos may complain.<br /><br /> It works well with stir fry, but my favorite is in soups.  When cooked slowly in broth (think crock-pot) it swells beautifully, and is a wonderful gift to your colon---I have irritable bowel syndrome, and use this product at least three times a week to keep everything balanced and flowing smoothly.<br /><br />You can also sprout these grains for a day or two, and increase the nutritional value.<br /><br />The Kashi website has a 6.5 oz box for $2.99.  I have never gotten a bad box from them---and the sesame seeds especially can go rancid in hot weather, so consider storing in fridge if you don't have AC.  I have not bought from this particular seller, so cannot comment on freshness here.

review/summary: Much more interesting that rice as a base for a meal
review/text: We love Kashi but often cook it in either chicken or vegetable stock instead of water.<br /><br />A favourite of mine is sauted chicken breasts, served on a bed of Kashi surrounded by baby spinach leaves tossed in sesame oil and fresh ground pepper.<br /><br />I find the trick to cooking kashi is to make sure you turn it down to a gentle simmer as soon as it hits boiling point. It usually takes a good  20 - 25 minutes - but can sometimes take longer - never figured out why the variance.<br /><br />Once the Kashi has been cooking for say 15 minutes, I'll toss some baby spinach in a salad bowl, then saute the chicken - turn the kashi off as soon as it's done - it will stay hot.<br /><br />Serve the chicken on a bed of kashi, surrounded by baby spinnach, and perhaps also snap peas.<br /><br />Big hit - looks good - very heathly - tastes great and it's dead simple.

review/summary: Kashi 7 Whole Grain Pilaf
review/text: Kashi 7 Whole Grain Pilaf is packaged into 3 bags per box.  Each bag makes approximate 2 cups of pilaf.  I ruined the first box trying to cook the pilaf.  I confess that, while I am an excellent cook, there are still somethings that I cannot be trusted to cook: rice and water.  A whistling teapot solved the water problem and a rice cooker solved the rice problem.  The pilaf is exactly the same as my rice problem so I experimented with cooking it in the rice cooker.  I was finally successful when I put the pilaf into the rice cooker with *exactly* the number of cups of water called for on the box--2 cups for each bag.  The lines on the side of the rice cooker are worthless for cooking this pilaf.  I also found that I had to reset the warm/cook button to cook a couple of extra times.  The resulting pilaf is a bit gummy after about an hour and I've thought about letting it sit on warm for a while to see what would happen but haven't had the time to do so yet.<br /><br />I eat cereals for breakfast:  cold and hot.  Farina must be cooked on the stove with a hand on the wisk which is not always convenient.  Heavy rolled oats may be cooked in the microwave but must be watched.  This pilaf may be cooked in the rice cooker with an occassional button pushing session.  I like that I can cook the pilaf and have it available to take to work for breakfast.  I have a cup of it for breakfast with a touch of sweetener.  It's a nice variation in textures.  My only complaint is that it is heavy on the calories.<br /><br />I have not yet used this as a side dish.  I suspect that, like rice pilafs, it will be a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Edited to add:  This review was written prior to my purchase of the nifty fancy rice cooker that I have reviewed elsewhere.  The rice cooker used here is one of the ka-ching ones.

review/summary: Consistant basic Mexican hot Chocolate you can dress up
review/text: First off - this is not an "instant' product the way most americans expect Hot Cocoa products to be.  It comes in cakes and must be ground either with a mortar & pestle or in a very sturdy grinder/blender.  It is a basic recipe which suits the majority.  Therefore, if you want it to be super spicy, you need to dress it up a bit.  Follow the package instructions for best results but use a whisk.  It needs to be made in a saucepan on top of the stove or in a Mr. Coffee Cocomotion machine.<br /><br />Grind the cakes in advance for maximum convenience and use 1 and a half times the recommended amount for best results. Use whole milk for best results or 2%.  Skim milk just doesn't work as well. For a spicier mug of cocoa, add ground chili powder to taste.  You can also add a piece of vanilla bean while cooking if you like that.  If you want even more cinnamon taste, you can cook with a cinnamon stick. You can add espresso powder as well for a nice change of pace.  Instant coffee will do in a pinch plus that's a good way to get rid of intsant coffee!<br /><br />It's best to try a few mugs of Ibarra before you decide to spice it up.  The flavor will grow on you. If you don't feel like paying the shipping fees, ask your grocer if they carry this item.  Most chain grocery stores with a Hispanic section do carry Ibarra.

review/summary: An even easier recipe for this yummy Mexican hot chocolate!
review/text: ...and yet another recipe, even easier:  Pour as much of whatever milk you like into a microwaveable mug.  Drop in 1/4 of a disc.  Microwave until YOUR microwave gets it as hot as you like.  Stir with a spoon (the chocolate will be all nice and melty) until it mixes up.  Kids might appreciate one extra tsp. of sugar, but I like it like this.  Good, good stuff.  Abuelita is good too, but this just that much better.

review/text: I too had the pleasure to taste the real deal in Mexico.  I loved it.  when I came home I sought out the real deal here in the states, I guess I did not look very far but I did come up with this pretty good substitute.  I also like nestles brand  Mexican chocolate, I tried them side by side and they are almost exactly the same.<br />I love the texture and I often, more than not, eat it just the way it is right from the bar.  But to make a good Mexican cocoa you need to use a paddle and put the chocolate in the cup, pour over the hot milk and paddle it till it is melted and foamy.  You do not need to microwave it, yuck!  You do not have to put it in the blender, Mexican people, for the most part, do not use blenders for their hot cocoa.  I buy it is the store it is too expensive here.

review/text: Extremely disappointed in this product. It barely tastes of cinnamon at all and is downright gross. My main complaint, however, is that it's not chocolate at all. It's a cake of sugar held together with dyed brown vegetable fat with a bit of cocoa liquor thrown in as an afterthought. Unbelievable that they market it as chocolate. And the list of ingredients on this product page conveniently leaves out the fact that it contains vegetable fat, which is clearly states on the package. It also does NOT contain cacao nibs, but rather cheap cacao liqueur. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS TRANS FATS in the form of manteca/vegetable fat, also known as hydrogenated oil or Crisco. Don't let the legal loophole of "0 grams" fool you.

If you are looking for a chocolate high, this is the product for you! You don't need a blender either. Just take a good chef's knife, cut off a piece of Ibarra, and slice the knife along one edge, progressively shaving down the block to a powder. Watch your fingers if you do this--we don't need any more Aztec blood sacrifice! Mix well with warm milk and enjoy the drink of the gods!

review/text: Love the package and the individually wrapped "cakes". Very visually appealing-would make a great gift.<br /><br />Please don't get turned off by hearing that you must chop or blend the cakes of chocolate before mixing in the milk then mix it all in a blender. Sure, you can do that and I'm sure the froth is wonderful however, give my method a try. It's super simple, I promise.<br /><br />First get a LARGE mug and fill with milk OR water. Nuke in the microwave for a minute or two. Place the entire chocolate "cake" slowly into the cup so it drops to the bottom. Let sit for a minute then with your spoon gently stir it around. The chocolate melts very quickly and easily. Now enjoy! The package does not say to use the whole cake but with a large cappucino mug, it was the perfect amount.<br /><br />As for the reviewer who thought kids may not like it, I have to share that my 5 and 8 yr olds loved it!<br /><br />One last thing, I bought mine (same size) at the regular grocery store for less than $4.

review/summary: Chocolate Like You've Never Had It!
review/text: I was first turned onto this chocolate when I visited a private Mexican themed coffee shop. I love a good mocha and that's usually how I judge a coffee shop first. This mocha was one-of-a-kind! I had to know what was in it. It was IBARRA!<p>Basically, Mexican chocolate is pure cocoa with cinnamon. IBARRA also adds some sugar and an emulsifier (which is why I only give it 4 stars). I have made mochas and hot chocolates at home and my guests think I'm a god (maybe an Aztec god!). It just really brings an orginal taste unlike any of those other cheap sugary brands (Nestle, Hershey's, ect.). <p>I highly recommend it. But two suggestions: IBARRA comes in &quot;bricks&quot; that you must chop or grind. We use a coffee bean grinder, but make sure it's a good quality grinder or cut the pieces into smaller pieces. Otherwise you might have a broken coffee bean grinder. For a real authentic feel you can use a stone and pistol just fine. And a recipe suggestion: Grind a portion of a Hazelnut for an added spice. ENJOY!

review/summary: Sadly disappointed in this product
review/text: After reading the reviews, I was syked to receive my order of Ibarra chocolate.  I love hot chocolate, and look forward to trying new flavors and brands.  I've never had "Mexican Chocolate", so maybe this is what it is supposed to be like, but I didn't like it at all.  It was hard as a rock, tasteless, and messy.  I followed the instructions of boiling some milk, chopping the chocolate in my blender, and mixing it together.  It came out foamy, like one reviewer described, but I was surprised to find it tasteless and flat!!  I ended up adding 4 T. of my standard coco mix just so I could finish the drink.  This was not at all what I expected, so if any of those three reviewers are looking for an open package, you can purchase mine!  In one word: YUCK!!!

review/summary: Tasty when laver leaves are CRISPY vs limpy
review/text: I grew up with these yummy snacks.  You will love them if they are crispy.  That "snap" is so beautiful.  Seaweed is full of minerals and iodine which you need for the continued health of your thyroid.  Now you know why some salt is IODIZED.

review/summary: No upset tummy!
review/text: I have a large breed and a small breed.  The smaller has an extremely sensitive stomach and throws up every food we try.  Finally we have found something that is for our older dogs and great for our little guy's stomach!

review/summary: My 3 dogs loved it, when it was in my budget.
review/text: My 3 large breed dogs really loved this dog food. I have "Buddy" an older Blue Heeler, "Rocky" a Black & Tan coonhound and a very large Pit bull named "Hutch". They're not too picky by any means, but, they really cleaned their bowls when I fed them this dry food. I had previously been feeding them all the regular Active formula and they loved it too. I'd highly recommend most of the Science Diet dry dog foods. My aunt raised and showed Doberman's and all she would feed was Science Diet and she had several champion Dobermans. If it's good enough for those champions it's good enough for my dogs!<br /><br />The only thing I can find fault with is that if you are on a strict budget and have more than one dog, you will find this food a little on the pricy side. Which is unfortunately, why I no longer feed it to my dogs.

review/summary: Jet Mango Mania is awesome
review/text: Its really good and taste like mango, even the little after bite of a mango.  My customers love it, I think the peach is even a little better.  Only down side is a lot of sugar, but sure taste good and refreshing.

review/summary: Made in china
review/text: My shitzu pups love these treats but I just read the fine print and discovered that the California company imports this from china. Given what is put in baby formula in china I can't imagine what they might put in dog treats. Sadly, we won't purchase again for this reason.
