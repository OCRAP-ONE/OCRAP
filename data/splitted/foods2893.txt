review/summary: The Best stuff YET!
review/text: Edit Below<br />I got this on sale and am new to this. I have been reading about the uses and was ready to try it.  The first thing I did was try it on my hair. I can't remember if I left a review on the other Coconut oil I bought but I have hair past my waist and I was in my pool on a hot day and when I finally got out I was exhausted.  I wanted to rest before I showered and passed out. I went to sleep with all of that chlorine in my hair and my hair was a dull, brittle feeling. I had just received the oil 2 days before. So I rubbed it through my hair. My hair seemed to be bright and soft. It even looked a little more blond. I have been cutting up veggies and spraying the oil on them while cooking. I bought the "Misto" and filled it with the Coconut oil. But the best thing so far...Is toast with the oil on it. There are so many benefits of the Oil and it is delicious.<br />***Here is the EDIT***9-5-12<br />I found a new delicious way to use this. You know the Olive oil bread dipping with garlic? Well, I made spaghetti and I put my seasonings and started to put my olive oil in my round dishes and right then I stopped. I put 2 tbsp of EVOO and 3 tbsp of Coconut oil the grated the garlic and added my Parmesan cheese. OMG, it was so wonderful.<br />Thanks to all of you who inspired me to start using this stuff.

review/summary: Tons of Uses!!
review/text: I decided to try this coconut oil after reading tons of blogs about all the different uses it has, and I'm really glad I did!<br /><br />My daughter has a pretty bad case of Keratosis Pilaris on both of her arms, and also her cheeks. I've tried numerous products on her to try to remove the little bumps, but nothing had worked. Almost immediately after applying a very thin layer of coconut oil on her skin, there was an amazing improvement! The bumps lessened, and after a week they had completely disappeared! After seeing these results, I had my son use it, who has eczema on his hands.... and again, the eczema cleared up almost immediately.<br /><br />I personally use the coconut oil on my hands to moisturize them, and also put a tablespoon of the stuff in my coffee every morning to help with my metabolism as I have thyroid issues.

review/summary: Cure for Cancer???
review/text: I know my title is a bit much, but this oil is seriously multi-purposed and it's that great. I use this brand on my daughter's skin from around 5mths to now 11mths. She had severe Ezcema and it kept recuring whenever she got hot. her skin in exactly like a baby's skin should be - soft and smooth since I started using it. Plus I'm always smelling her bc she smells so yummy. OFF TOPIC: I also give her lots of pure coconut water and she loves it<br />For me, I spread it on my toast, sprinkle on my salads, saute with it - scrambled eggs are THE BEST when fried with this. I even put a few teaspoons in my hot choclate (yummy). It's the best for retaining moisture in your hair so I also use as a hot oil treatment before bed and wash off next day. I let my hair air dry and it's the softest its been in years. I lather with is right after my shower and wake up with soft supple skin. I keep one in the bathroom, another in the Kitchen and one in my daughter's room. I will NEVER be without this super product.<br />Oh and my mom swears by it too as it's helped control her blood sugar (she's a diabetic) Her Doc is so impressed he took her off Metformin.

review/summary: A Hair Miracle!
review/text: I've been natural for almost a year now and its hard to find a product that could really add moisture to my hair while killing my dandruff problem.  I was hesitate at first after seeing a friend use it on his hair (He's Spanish so it works with different hair types)I thought his hair took well to the product because of the completely different texture, but I tried it anyway.<br /><br />I must say my hair absolutely loves this stuff. It not only moisturizer my hair but it makes it really soft and manageable. It also gives my hair shine, body, and luster. Although, I have flakes here and there the amount of dandruff has decreased dramatically, when I use the product consistently.I have even given it a test run by allowing my hair to go without it for about a week. I only used regular conditioner on my hair. The results were terrible. My hair became dried and rough. It lost the luster and shine and it was no longer silky to the touch.<br /><br />This product is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone with any hair type.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: Unlike the medical establishment, I have come to believe that fats in general are NOT harmful OR fattening!  There are so many different types if fat, they should not all be lumped together.  Avoid the long chain saturated fats (animal fats), but short chain saturated fats (like butter, palm, and coconut) are fine.<br /><br />I love cooking my morning eggs in this oil.  They stick WAY less than cooked in butter or olive oil.  Yes, it imparts a VERY MILD coconut taste to whatever you cook in it.  I don't mind, and have come to like it.  It was different the first few times, tho.  I also recommend you get an aluminum anodized (ceramic non-stick) pan.  Yes, I know they still contain teflon...doesn't bother me (the anodize coating is porous, and the pores are filled with teflon).  The anodized aluminum is so much more durable you will love it!<br /><br />Satisfied customer...great product...great price...I'll be buying regularly!

review/text: I have been enjoying this product as a spread for waffles in the morning (with a little cinnamon) and for cooking fish and other stir fry dishes.  Makes for a nice change from olive oil and it has a lovely flavor and scent.  I also use it on my lips when a I need a quick moisturizer.  This product does change very quickly from solid to liquid when it is warmed.  That is great for cooking, but when using it as a spread, it can be messy.  The fridge can make it too hard and leaving it on the counter in the summer will turn it to oil. I have not found the happy medium yet, but I like the product so I will continue to use it.

My hair does not grow back so prickly. I also love how when I go into the ocean after I shave my legs it does not burn anymore! I also use this for baking food. My food comes out more moist, especially cakes. There are so many good health reasons to use coconut oil. For skin and for eating. wow I love multi tasking:)

review/summary: Awesome conditioner for thick African American hair!
review/text: This coconut oil works wonders for my hair! I'm transitioning from using over the counter products with more natural alternatives and I truly am pleased. After about a month of using it as an overnight prepoo and after wash sealer I have noticed a change for the better in my hair. Coconut oil is the only oil that can penetrate into your hair follicles. My hair holds moisture a lot better than ever before, is stronger, shinier, smoother and softer. It makes a great hot oil treatment in tandem with amla oil. The smell isn't strong - it has a light nutty coco butter scent.<br /><br />Also, I found using this with shea butter liquifies it easier when rubbing your palms together. I've only used this product on my hair but I would love to try it with cooking.

review/summary: Excellent for skin, hair, and cooking
review/text: I bought this primarily to use on my hair after using coconut oil in small bottles that I would have to microwave before use because they were solid. This oil is easy to scoop out and it melts in your hands so doesn't need to be continually microwaved. I ran out of anti-wrinkle cream, so I decided to put this oil of my face instead, and it makes it very soft and supple and hopefully it will keep the wrinkles at bay as well. On a whim, I decided to use some while frying rice and it came out absolutely delicious. It gives a hint of coconut flavor to dishes cooked in it. I'm ordering another jar because I don't want to cook with something I'm scooping out to use on my face and hair.  I will be ordering many more jars.

review/text: Very good quality unrefined coconut oil.  I coom with this and used it to mix with shea butter when i was pregnant for preventing stretch marks and itching and it worked great.  I use it for my baby's ezema now too, its greasy on the skin but soaks in quickly.  When cooking I use it in place of butter and olive oil and it has actually helped with my weight loss and my husbands, of course you have to eat healthy too but it made a noticeable difference in a two week period of time.

review/text: I thought I hated coconut oil, because I bought the cheap, processed Louanna coconut oil from Wally World. It is still sitting in the cupboard with only one use. Later, I read an article and found that to get the benefits of coconut oil you need it unrefined. When I opened the lid the smell of coconut assured me that this oil was the real thing--I love this stuff! I've used it so many different ways; my favourite ways to use are as a sugar scrub or as a deodorant--melt a few tablespoons of oil, put in 1/8 cup baking soda and cornstarch, and a couple drops of tea tree oil.

review/text: Before I get rambling, I have to say this stuff smells FANTASTIC, Crazy or not, occasionally I'll just open the jar and take a nice inhale.<br /><br />I bought this for two reasons, 1 my dog and I have been fighting the ups and downs of skin treatments for years. Antibiotics, skin creams, food changes, special shampoos, ugh you name it, I've put more money onto my dogs rear end then I have ever spent on myself, and to top it off all his skin issues make him smelly! I read online that coconut oil helps solve a multitude of issues inside and out, and since it's something all natural, I feel better about using it in general.<br /><br />I put it directly onto his legs and lower back just today, the fragrant coconut oil really helps with cutting back on how smelly he is, He seems less restless with his itchy spots - but only time will really tell if this stuff is really going to make any progress for him.<br /><br />The other reason I purchased this was because I wanted to make my own handmade soap, and it worked just fine for that use!

It is the best moisturizer for my face and hair (I have tried almond, shea and grapeseed too), and not to mention, it feels so smooth, creamy and totally awesome on my hands, fingertips and feet.  Also, this is totally natural and cold pressed.  What more can you ask for?  No bad odors either (unlike shea oil)!  I have used the Nutiva organic coconut oil too, and Nature Way just feels a lot better and totally awesome on my hands.  I cannot comment as far as cooking is concerned, because I go through these jars very fast just using them for hair and skincare and scalp message.  I use this and pure almond oil alternatively on my eyelids and under eyes.  Try it by all means, if you are thinking about it.

review/summary: Delightful taste!
review/text: I'm just starting out with coconut oil, and after trying this product,well, I'm a now believer.  I wasn't sure what I'd gotten myself into when I first tried a spoonful.  The texture reminded me a bit of crisco (uh!), but it immediately started to warm on my tongue and there was a heavenly, light coconut aftertaste that reminded me a bit of an almond joy bar (without the almond or chocolate).  I prefer not to eat it by the spoonful because of the consistency, but really like spreading it on a graham cracker, the taste of which reminds me of coconut cream pie with a graham cracker crust. I also like cooking with it, and didn't notice coconut-tasting chicken. I recently ordered a larger amount of coconut oil and tried a different brand, but I prefer the Nature's Way flavor. I'll use the other brand as a moisturizing cream, and order more of the Nature's Way for eating and cooking. It's wonderful for moisturizing after a shower, or for using right before bed when the coconut scent is restful. This is my favorite brand, and I'm sticking to it.

review/text: I was surprised how large the tub actually was. The coconut oil is in a crisco consistency, but when I bake something with it, I just smear it on the pan, and when I fry something with it, I just drop it in the pan like I would butter. It smells incredible! After cooking with it, I could smell it on me for a few hours after and loved it. I use lots of it when I make coconut chicken, shrimp, etc. I use it to sautee my vegetables too. The coconut taste is not overwhelming, so substituting this healthy option for your regular cooking oil will not "ruin" your dishes or significantly change the taste of your food. I will purchase again.

review/text: My sister introduced me to coconut oil and although she was weary about me using it as face lotion I showed her that it helped me A LOT with my dry skin and did not cause acne. Normally I have really dry skin on my nose at forehead to the extent that it would start peeling off in the middle of the day... and no lotions would work! :( Coconut oil is the only thing that keeps my skin fairly normal in this regard -- especially with the dry, harsh winters of IL. Any coconut oil would do, but this one is low cost, high quality, has fast shipping. Basically, once this jar runs out, I'm ordering it again.

review/text: This coconut oil has truly been my little miracle product. I have Keratosis Pilaris and I have tried different products for years trying to get rid of it or improve it even a little, to no avail. I have tried countless lotions, including KP Duty. About a month ago I stumbled upon an article of someone claiming coconut oil cleared up her keratosis, I was skeptical but figured it was worth a shot. I have been applying coconut oil to my skin every time I take a shower and also mixing in about 1/2 a tablespoon with my dinner for about a month now.  I also added a daily multivitamin into my diet. The progress was slow but now all of a sudden my skin has shown incredible improvement. I would say my keratosis has cleared up as much as 75%!  I am shocked and very happy.  Such a cheap alternative to all the expensive lotions too!! I will continue to use Coconut Oil for life.

This is a good price as I've seen it for a lot more in our local stores.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I am from the Philippines, so I am familiar with the smell of fresh coconut oil. I have tried various so-called virgin coconut oils before, but they smelled so rancid within one week of opening, that at one point I resorted to rendering my own coconut oil, but that was so time-consuming and tedious. Some other brands were masked by additional scent. For a while I was discouraged from trying any coconut oil, until I read reviews on this one. I tried one, and I was hooked. It smelled so HEAVENLY like the fresh coconut that I remember. Every time I would apply on my skin or hair, I would be reminded of our rice-based coconut desserts, so for purposes of having a dose of 1-2 tbsp per day, it was also not hard for me to take it plain, although the lack of sweetness quickly brings me back to the reality that it was not coconut-y dessert I was eating, but that's easily solved by adding muscovado or brown sugar. This is certainly the best coconut oil I have had so far, and the ONLY one I have tried and actually finished (I used to stop using those previous ones when I could no longer stomach the rancid smell, which usually brought the content down to only 25%).  This is also the first coconut oil brand that I actually tried to bake with (although it quickly used up my tub). I have subscribed for this to be delivered monthly, but I might change that to a more frequent supply of fresh tubs. After I was truly impressed by it, only then did I check out where it came from, and was surprised to find that it came from my country! Keep up the good work of making available a quality product to the whole world!

review/summary: A few probelms
review/text: Coconut oil is very temperature-sensitive. If the room is even slightly warm, it liquifies until it looks like water. In the fridge, it turns rock-hard. I am frequently moving it hither and thither to keep it at the consistency I like.<br /><br />The last two shipments I received were incorrectly packaged. Since it was summer and quite hot, the coconut oil arrived in its water-like state. Whoever packed them put them on their sides and consequently, several of them which were also not adequately sealed, leaked and soaked the box they came in. Amazon replaced the 3 leaky ones. Unfortunately, the same guy must have packaged them. He (she) put them in upside down. All 3 leaked.<br /><br />On the brighter side, I bought it because a doctor on line said it help cure her husband of Alzheimer's. I've been giving it to my husband who suffers from a different type of dementia. It hasn't cured him but his decline seems to have slowed and he likes the taste of it.<br /><br />Another plus is that the price at Amazon is about half of what I have seen at stores and it has many other uses.

review/summary: Made my skin dry but hair is softer
review/text: I have been using Coconut Oil topically for 3-4 weeks and although I fell in love with how well it conditions my hair, it has caused my skin to become dryer.  My skin became noticeably itchy and scaly after using only coconut oil as a sole moisturizer for a month.  As soon as I ceased and switched to lotion, my skin became rehydrated.  It also clogged the pores on my face.  I got a couple of pimples on my cheeks where I have never had pimples before.  I'm not sure why it has not worked as well for me as others.  I have ceased using it as a skin moisturizer but will continue to apply it to my hair a few hours before I shampoo and condition my hair, hair is noticeably softer and more manageable with this product.

review/summary: Tastes Good And Is Not Expensive
review/text: I don't know if this is making me healthier or not but I have added into my shake on recommendation from my grandmother. It tastes like coconut! I only take a teaspoon a day so I can warm up to it. After about 3 weeks I should be taking a tablespoon or 2. The price is right on this oil.<br /><br />Shake: Amazing Meal Pomegranate-Mango Superfood Powder, frozen strawberries, frozen cranberries, frozen raspberries, half a banana, almond milk, Greek yogurt, Big Train Strawberry Smoothie Mix and Nature's Way coconut oil. This is a thick, thick shake that will fill you up for hours.<br /><br />Update 10/08/12: I have found by far the most efficient and delicious way to get my daily 1 tablespoon. Take 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and heat until it's clear and oily in a dish. Mix in 1 heaping tablespoon of peanut butter. Stir until the peanut butter is evenly mixed into the oil. Eat on whatever. I have found that if I put large amounts on each bite, it is good sized or a bagel. The coconut oil mellows out the flavor and stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth quality of the peanut butter, so I can eat much more on a bite than if it was just peanut butter. Delicious protein and good fats.

review/summary: It Works
review/text: Gonna make this short and sweet. I use it to *shallow* fry lot's of food. I take it also just as it is when I am feeling lazy and don't feel like eating. After a 4 day juice fast, I started a vegetarian diet, with next to no meat (I currently don't eat meat or eggs, or any dairy products), HIGH plant fats, probably a couple pounds of fruits and veggies every day, and lots of coconut milk. Oh, and lets not forget beans and rice, unprocessed kinds of course. Despite my high fat diet, I am dropping fat weekly. While there may or may not be a profound effect with this oil, I can safely say that it hasn't added any fat. In fact, I am pretty certain that it aids in fat metabolisation. Plus, you get a rare type of MCT with this product, which makes up nearly 70% of the fat contained in the oil.<br /><br />On a side note... DON'T BE AFRAID OF PLANT FATS!! You want to lose weight? Stop eating processed foods (ALL TYPES), eat beans and bulk rice (Wild, Forbidden, Long Grain Brown, Red Rice etc..), nuts/seeds, nutbutter and coconut! Oh, and veggies too of course. Its easy AND CHEAP to eat well. It took me quite some time to be able to figure out how to eat so well on a less than stellar budget, but it can be done! &lt;3

Simply put, its just good for you.  This particular brand is better than others I've compared it to.

review/text: so I'm a college student who has been trying to learn how to live a much healthier life in the mist of crazy assignments and packed schedules. I bought this back in January originally for my hair since I'm an African American woman with 3c/4a natural hair. and while it has done WONDERS growing my hair, I've been even more amazed by its other talents. If you use it as an occasional moisturizer it will leave you skin sooooooo soft. I also use it now as a substtute of oil/butter when I'm using my frying pan. You can hardly taste it, and when you do it doesn't taste bad at all. And it works better than oil and butter in my opinion. I'm not a chef but it seems to still burn a little bit when you use oil or butter. With this coconut oil, i just pour a dime size in the pan and use a paper towel to distribute it evenly so it give it a nice gloss. I let it heat for just a few seconds, add my food, and then wa la! no burning, and no more unnecessary calories. I will credit it (along with my diet and exercise) for allowing me to lose 30 pounds this summer. WOOH!

It is not only good for you, it has a wonderful flavor in low temp cooking(from eggs to oatmeal), used as a spread, in morning smoothies(adds a crunch as well because it hardens when cooled) and in baking!

review/summary: Love this!
review/text: I purchased this to use in place of chemical-filled skin lotions.  I had developed some allergic reactions to some items in man-made lotions and my naturopath recommended using organic coconut oil instead.  I LOVE this oil.  It has a light coconut smell that does not linger too long.  I use this all over including on my face and my skin has been more moist (no longer do my legs get dry looking), my face less oily and with fewer blemishes.  My husband has noted that my skin looks younger and fresher.  It DOES take a while to soak in so I have had to adjust my routine a bit to avoid getting oil on things but have yet to stain any clothing or other items.  I tried a couple brands I found at the store prior to ordering this after reading the reviews and have found the brand I will remain loyal to in Nature's Way Effagold.<br /><br />I have also used this in cooking and love the light coconut taste it adds to food.  I still use EVOO for certain things as the taste just compliments certain foods better, but this oil has definitely been added to the diet and is in the rotation.

review/text: Great aroma and wonderful flavor.  Coming from the land of coconuts, I found this to be a superior product similar to what we get there - a high quality.  Some refined oils have a heady aroma which gets "cooked" out.  This one retains its aroma even after cooking. I have used it for sauteing, pan-frying and seasoning with no flavor loss.  Tastes even delicious when raw.  Bit on the expensive side but I'm ready to pay that extra penny for great flavor.

review/summary: Delicious and healthy - Organic EV Coconut Oil
review/text: I'm a recent convert to the overwhelming benefits of coconut oil. I previously used the Spectrum Naturals brand from a local grocery chain, but gave this one a try because it was a little less expensive. This coconut oil is far better in my opinion. It smells great in the jar, and smells AMAZING when cooking. I've used it for almost every meal I've needed oil for since getting it: browning meat, making crepes, even homemade marinades. When cooking a recipe with many ingredients the flavor tends to get lost, but for less complex meals (like lime shrimp I sauteed last week) you could taste a hint of coconut in the meal. What a fantastic addition! So far everyone, even our kids, has had nothing but rave reviews about it.<br /><br />It's summer and very warm here, so when we got our first jar it was completely liquid. It was a surprise to me, because every jar I'd bought at the store was always like a thick white paste. No worries; if that bothers you, just put in the fridge and it'll harden right up.

My only concern at first was that the oil was in liquid format. But after reading the the information on the back of the jar, it did state that it will become solid at room temperature. So I will wait to see if it gets solid. I have ordered coconut oil in the past, but it did not smell like coconut. This product actually smells like coconut. I love the smell. I have opened the jar at least 5 times while writing this to take in the aroma. So excited to try my new coconut oil on my newly natural hair.

I use it as a butter to put on a toast, I add it to my meat dishes, I eat it from the spoon with my tea and apply it as a body lotion...that is how much "action" you can get out of that jar. It has a very pleasant light coconut taste and aroma. Just a very good product overall.

review/text: I use a lot of coconut oil. It's great for anything from moisturizing your skin to cooking vegetables. This brand is a good brand. I alternate between Nature's Way Organic and Nutiva Organic depending on whichever one is cheaper when i reorder.

review/text: This product is amazing. I had no idea how many benefits one jar could have. Use it on your entire body, eat it, cook with it. It helps everything from dry skin and hair to blood pressure and diabetics. It also boosts your metabolism. If you are thinking of purchasing this product just do a google search on benefits of coconut oil and read up on it. You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Tasty, health oil.
review/text: This oil is not liquid at room temperature. Also, it has a relatively low smoke point. Those facts out of they way, this is a very high quality coconut oil. It smells wonderful and everything cooked in it takes on a hint of coconut. I use this in my coffee, fry eggs in it, saute spinach in it, as well as enjoy a tablespoon of it before my workouts. I have read that there are non-food related things you can do with this as well (good for skin, etc) but I have only experienced it through a culinary lens.

review/summary: Hair SOOO Soft Skin so Soft
review/text: I really am happy with this product. It moisturizes my hair extremely well and doesnt leave a look of build up and absorbs beautifully. I have 4a hair in lower back length locks and absorbtion is something that is a must for anything i use in my hair.I am excited to continue using it and I also have used it on my skin. I absorbs well to the skin too leaving my skin supple but not greesy.<br /><br />If you dont like the smell of coconut it may not be the product for you. But if you enjoy the smell it is very pleasant and it is not over powering.I will try mixing this into a whipped shea butter blend also for skin and let you guys know how it come out :-)

I cook Shirataki noodles in it, eggs, anything. I especially love to eat hot cereal and put a dollop of coconut oil in it. It's really delish. I hope all the health claims I read are true! Start slow, though. The first week I had a lot of diarrhea. I think your body takes time to get used to it; I don't have that problem anymore.

review/summary: Coconut Oil "Miracle of Nature"
review/text: I purchased this product and used it for one month. I had lab work taken in February prior to starting the use of the coconut oil. Then I started using the coconut oil, in my food and on my skin. I used the whole 16 oz container in March. Then I had my labs redone in April 1st. My A1C in February was 9.7 the most recent A1C is now 7 which is almost normal. So even though I was also taking my medication, the addition of the coconut oil was the miracle in my book. I have signed up for subscribe and save and will be using the coconut oil with a shipment monthly. I was hesitant at what the results would be as I have tried other things, but it works. Used it on a skin rash as soon as it started and within two days it was gone. Try it for yourself.

review/text: I've been using coconut oil for a long time.  After reading the many compliments via various websites I gave it a try.  I mainly use it for cooking, but also oral health after brushing my teeth.  Your teeth will feel like satin after placing a 1/2 tsp. in your mouth and allowing it to melt.  Swish it around, then rinse.  I've tried numerous brands and can't say enough about this one.  Well priced, clean tasting, a hint of coconut smell.  Top quality.

review/summary: YUM!  AMBROSIA!
review/text: After reading several of Bruce Fife's books (and they were wonderfully easy-to-read for the non-scientific type), I decided to give coconut oil a try to help with losing weight and getting my blood sugar under control. As a non-medication taking, recently diagnosed diabetic, I want to try whatever natural remedies I can find to stay off insulin and other diabetes meds, in addition to meds for cholesterol, etc. I tried taking a teaspoon or two with meals and a teaspoon btw meals and my blood sugar numbers were noticeably lower the same day. (Fife says the suggested dose is 3-4 tbs/day). The taste of this brand is fantastic, light and creamy with a delicious coconutty taste! I love coconut so I was able to eat it right from the jar, but I also tried it spread on a Wasa Crisp bread--WOW, what an easy way to get MCFAs into your diet! I will definitely be using this instead of any oils for all my cooking needs (except a little EVOO mixed together with this for salad dressing.) Also, I'm using on my skin and it feels really soft, plus you also get the internal benefits from using it on your skin! GREAT PRODUCT!

review/text: I've gone to wearing my hair "natural"--no chemical relaxers to straighten it. On advice from other African-American women who have also gone the natural route, I tried mixing coconut oil, unrefined shea butter, and aloe gel to use on my hair. The results are nothing short of miraculous! My hair is soft, shiny, and manageable. I use the braid-out/twist-out styling methods, and the resulting curls and spirals are absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Also, I've read up on the health benefits of coconut oil, so I will definitely be experimenting with it in my cooking.

review/summary: Amazing Stuff!
review/text: We initially purchased Coconut Oil for dietary reasons. My wife and I had both read multiple books and articles that stated how healthy Coconut oil is and we are constantly looking for ways to improve our diets. We have since incorporated it into many aspects of our diets. In particular, its amazing with some of the juicing recipes we have come up with. I also enjoy cooking with it, but only with certain meals. Its important to note that cooking oils at high temperatures really cuts down on the nutritional content. So we always cook at lower temperatures when using Coconut or Olive oil. Anyways, we have come to love Coconut oil and it now has a permanent spot in our food pantry.<br /><br />We also started making homemade soap a few years back and while we didn't use coconut oil originally, we figured we would try it since we already had jars of it sitting on our shelves. Well, to make a long story short, its now incorporated in every single one of our recipes. In fact, my favorite soap is actually a recipe that focuses specifically on the coconut oil.<br /><br />Lastly, my wife one upped the soap making and started making homemade shampoo and conditioners and to say that they are amazing is a massive understatement. In particular, the conditioner she makes is unbelievable. I dont know the recipes but I do know that coconut oil is one of the major ingredients that she uses. My hair has never been softer and neither has hers. On top of that the smell is absolutely hypnotic.<br /><br />Bottom line - 12 months ago Coconut oil had absolutely no place in our home. Fast forward to today and....well, it now plays an major role in our lives, both for dietary and hygienic purposes. Even if you dont make homemade soaps, the health benefits alone should be more than enough for you to incorporate Coconut oil into your diet. Its one of the healthiest oils out there.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

review/summary: instant pedicure in a bottle
review/text: I purchased this after scouring onc of my favorite sites [...]  about natural ways to deal with rough, dry, feet.  I get biweekly pedicures but that gets expensive!  One of the reviewers recommended applying coconut oil daily and you'll never have to worry about rough feet again.  I have to honestly admit that she was right!  I only get a pedicure for the pampering every couple of months no longer the necessity and because of the results I apply the coconut oil to my entire body after the bath and I can't believe the difference in my skin's texture.  It's unbelievable.  The only thing about this one is during the summer months you have to find a cool place in the house to keep this such as underneath the bathroom cabinet or in the linen closet because it will liquify.  As a mattef of fact I keep it in my bedroom during showering so the steam from the shower won't won't liquify it because once it liquifies it will eventually reharden at room temperature but the consistency changes which to me also changes the chemical structure in it or something because it just doesn't moisturize the same afterwards.  But I love, love, love this product.  It's a must have.  It's has a light, chocolate fragrance to it which is a plus.

review/text: I am from Asian descent and we regularly use coconut oil for everything. My Mother used to make me coconut oil by shredding the meat, hand pressing the liquids, then boil the water out. This oil tastes and smells just like the kind my Mother used to spend hours making.  This is definitely worth the price for the amount of oil that you get.

review/summary: Great product for great price thanks All star health
review/text: I bought this product from the amazon vendor ALL STAR HEALTH and I must say it is just as described and got speedy shipment. This is great for my hair and skin. I've made Ice pops for my kid sister,her friends, and myself and they taste great. I am afro Caribbean with wavy hair opposed to super kinky hair but my hair gets really dry if I leave it out(wash n set style). But this is great for those using protective styling and for the swimmers like myself. It keeps my hair moist and doesn't weigh it down and my skin look great as well. People don't realize that the chlorine in our shower/water systems here in the states is very drying on our hair and bodies. I'm just glad I got a product that 100% natural and from a vendor who I can trust. I've been ripped off by buying hair products at walmart and supply stores. I live in a predominantly white neighborhood and it is very hard finding things that work for my hair. So, I have to go to neighborhoods out of my way or shop online. And after finding out I bought conditioner that was mixed with bleach (clorox) from an online store that turned my hair into straw/ash it can be very frustrating. So I had to cut off my hair about 5 inches and I'm re-growing it. I had to file a claim with the business bureau and everything. But, thank god for reviews or I wouldn't know where to shop or who to trust these days.

review/summary: BEST OIL FOR BAKING, FRYING, SKIN SOFTENER, OR RIGHT OUT OF THE JAR
review/text: After menopause, I developed high total cholesterol.  Fortunately, only the "lousy" cholesterol (LDH) increased, with my "happy" number (HDL) staying at an impressive 90.  Instead of taking the recommended "liptor, et al", and as a registered nurse who knows the awful side effects of such drugs, I opted to research all things diet related.  After my studies, I have decided that our government and medical community has been either ignorant, at best, or complicit, at worst, in the great soybean growers maligning of the health benefits of this oil.  There are a few good scientific books available through Amazon.  I'm not due for another lipid test for at least a year.  I will post an update here, good or bad outcome.<br /><br />Whole Foods stopped carrying this brand.  I tried their new 365 brand and had to spit it out --- TOTAL PLASTIC TASTE AND SMELL.  This product is in a non-leaching plastic container and is incredibly pleasant tasting raw (only do that after eating anything sweetened with sugar or honey to prevent cavities), but unbelievably delicious in cooking.  Last week I was in an interview and the lady turned and smiled stating she detected a "slight, delightful hint of just-baked cookies" coming from my direction.  HAD TO BE THIS OIL I always pop a little in my mouth before going out!!!!!<br /><br />Watch the medical statistics that will be coming out of the country of Jamaica in the next two to three years.  The soybean inudstry has recently purchased all the coconut fields, torn down the trees, and planted soybeans!!!!!  If the studies I am trusting in are correct, they will begin developing a high incidence of heart disease and strokes, almost unknown to them up until now!!!!!

review/text: Wow...I cannot believe how unbelievable this product is.  I am trying to eat healthier and find better alternatives to eating organic as well as preserve the taste of food, or even better, make it tastier.  Although it has been just a bit challenging to eat organic and also consume healthy, tasty products, this has made cutting fast foods completely out TOTALLY WORTH IT. I cannot believe I have never cooked with coconut oil before.  I used it with my ordinary seafood dish and popcorn butter substitute.  It melts immediately and adds a crisp to whatever savory dish you are making.  The faint, but identifiable taste of coconut oil makes the dish even BETTER.  SERIOUSLY, WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT?  With all the positive reviews, purchasing an item for the first time can be a tiny, wee bit difficult for a newbie.  However, if you are planning to eat healthy and use better cooking alternative oils and saturate your food with a bit more fat (good fat), use coconut oil.  Since this was the brand and product that immediately popped up when I was looking for coconut oil, I will say this is a very high quality and yummmmmmy item to purchase.  I will definitely incorporate more coconut oil in most of all my dishes as I cook many of meals.  Although I have not yet cooked a sweet dish using coconut oil, I am assuming it will be quite delicious as well.  I still cannot get over how additionally tasty my food is with this new additional to my cooking ingredient cart.  So worth it...I recommend this product to everyone and will be talking my family into this cooking alternative immediately.  Delicious and healthy.

review/summary: Good for oil pulling and consumption
review/text: I decided to try oil pulling, and selected this coconut oil to try with.  I will say - I'm not sure if I buy into the whole coconut oil pulling "thing", but anything's worth a shot!  I found that it's best (for me) to put a glob of the oil UNDER my tounge to melt.  Just sticking a glob in my mouth on top of my tounge made me want to barf.  After it melts under my tounge, I can swish it - and the taste is very subtle.  It almost feels like I'm just swishing saliva around.<br /><br />I also decided to start incorporating this oil into my morning cup of coffee as I've seen other reviews mention.  It doesn't really add any taste, but is an easy way to get this in my body - also moisturizes my lips as I drink it!  Yum!<br /><br />I haven't tried any other coconut oils, but this seems to fit the bill - no complaints!

review/summary: Great Multi-Use Product
review/text: I love this coconut oil! I use it to take off makeup, as a moisturizer, as a conditioner, and as a cooking oil!<br /><br />As a makeup remover, I use it on dry skin and rub the oil in for around a minute. Then using a warm/hot towel, I let the towel sit on my face until cool. I repeat the process with the towel 2-3 times (depending on how much makeup I have on) and then in slow, circular motions, I rub the makeup off with my towel. It takes off all my makeup, my waterproof mascara, and my sunblock. It leaves my skin feeling clean but not stripped of oil.<br /><br />As a moisturizer, I use it only at night (too oily to use in the morning), after my toner and green cream. I take a little bit and warm it in the palm of my hand. I rub it into my dry spots (which have sometimes crop up due to my use of green cream) and follow up with a cream-based moisturizer to seal it in. I put a bit around my eyes and some on my eyelashes and eyebrows. In the morning, my skin looks plump and remarkably fresh! I love it!<br /><br />As a conditioner, I place a little bit of it in damp hair and leave it in overnight. After washing, my hair (which has been permed, colored, bleached, and ironed to hell and back) feels soft and conditioned!!<br /><br />As a cooking oil, I just use it like I would use olive oil or any other cooking oil. There have been claims that this oil will help with weight loss, but I haven't really noticed any of that. I use it mainly because it smells delicious!! It's great when making curry!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone!

review/summary: Great product.
review/text: I must begin by saying I LOVE coconut oil. Cooking, beauty, healthcare...I've used it in many different applications. The reason I took off a star is because when this shipped (in a warm month) it came liquified and upon solidifying became somewhat grainy. I tried a different brand that came the same way but solidified without any graininess. If you're not going to consume it straight out of the container this should not bother you at all.

review/summary: Yet another coconut oil review
review/text: When I looked to buy coconut oil, I had no idea there was such a avid fan base.  So I'll make it short.  I've bought one other brand of coconut oil besides this, and they both are about the same,  except that this brand stand in a more liquid form longer than the other brand.  (which turns out to be great when adding it to homemade ice cream!)  Besides that I was satisfied with both.  I bought this because it was more economical.  I didn't think I'd like the subscription program, but it's turning out to be VERY convenient.  I was able to change the options around right before delivery, and it comes just like it should.  Plus, I know the product and the price I'm getting without having to make the arduous health food store comparison shopping drive.<br /><br />That's about the best you can ask for a product like this.  If it's going to cost more than regular butter and oil, at least it's a good product, and comes without me going to fetch it.

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: This coconut oil is a great product, and at a good price on Amazon.  Organic, unrefined coconut oil can be expensive when purchased locally.  I started using this regularly for cooking and baking, and I'm very pleased with the results!  It's delicious on toast, waffles and pancakes, and perfect for stir-frying vegetables and meats, as it has a better heat tolerance than olive oil.  Also, I believe it's helped me with my cholesterol imbalance. I tested once at a low HDL (good) level.  After some research on the benefits of unrefined coconut oil on cholesterol, I gave it a try.  A recent blood test confirmed an increase to a healthy HDL level, as well as a low LDL (bad) level.

review/summary: Delicious coconut oil!
review/text: I've been using coconut oil for a few years now and am pleased to see that its benefits are finally being touted...now that saturated fat is no longer villainified, thank goodness. Coconut oil's praises are long overdue! We used to buy more expensive coconut oil; but these are tough economic times, so we've been using cheap coconut oil. I read all the great reviews on this site and can't believe that for the cheap price, it's organic AND cold-pressed/hexane-free. We've got another brand of what I'd loosely dub coconut oil sitting in the cabinet next to this brand, and although they are similar in price, that's where the similarities end. That stuff is going in the garbage where it belongs. I could barely even taste coconut when using it. I won't go back.<br /><br />I eat about 3 tbsp of this stuff per day and, naturally, it's satisfying. As soon as you open the jar, you can smell the coconut. And the taste...delicious! If you're already a fan of coconut oil and are aware of its healthy properties, try this brand. You won't be sad that you did. And if you're just learning about its merits, this coconut oil is perfect to start using. If you don't like it, you haven't really lost much money. I "subscribed" to this product in order to ensure that I've always got a fresh tub on hand!

review/summary: Coocoo for Coconut Oil!
review/text: Great product!  I use it for cooking and in my smoothies.  The flavor is wonderful, and it always seems to bring out the natural flavors of meat and seafood.  It has also helped me control and lose weight.  I weighed in at 205 lbs at the beginning of the year and with proper diet, exercise and a spoonful of coconut oil daily, I have lost 25 lbs.  If you want to cut out salt and sugar from your diet but not taste, try cooking with coconut oil.  It will enhance the flavors of your food and help you fix those nasty cravings.

review/summary: So many uses
review/text: This product is great. I use it on my and my baby after showers/baths and it has cleared up my skin from many different blemishes (Dry spots, red patches and red bumps I have had for years). I have also used it on my hair and it has helped get rid of the dry brittle frizz.<br />Since I use it everyday it has helped me not to get sunburned.<br />I also have used it on popcorn (so good) and with cooking rice. Can't wait to find more cooking uses for it.<br />Also a very good price and I love that I don't have to go to the store to get more when I run out.

review/summary: love this stuff!!
review/text: So I've used it twice now...only for my hair ..I just put it all over my head and leave it in for about 2 hours..then wash it out really good because if you leave some in after you shower it still feels oily...I usually have to wash my hair twice<br />..but it feels sooooo soft after I use it.  I notice that my ends haven't been breaking as bad..and im the type of person that styles my hair almost everyday :) definitely recommend.

review/summary: Hair Revitalizer
review/text: My hair, for the most part, is healthy & easy to maintain, but I couldn't grow it past the middle of my back. At that point, the ends become terribly brittle & eventually fray. However, that's no longer a problem since I started using coconut oil as a deep conditioner. The jar says to apply 1-2 hours before washing your hair, but it's obviously better if you leave it in longer. After one use (overnight), my split ends were substantially reduced, all the strands felt smooth from root to tip, & my waves were at their bounciest! Not only is it the most effective solution I've come across, it's also natural & the cheapest.<br /><br />I can't really comment on its other curative properties aside from skincare. I would advise against it in favor of jojoba oil. Coconut oil is heavier & may clog pores. However, it doesn't deserve to get knocked for that considering how well it works on hair.<br /><br />Also, the oil will congeal if it gets in the low 70s. Don't freak out, it's still good & less messy to apply since you can get a good amount on your fingers. If you can't get down like that, just put it in hot water & it will return to its liquid state. Oh, and be careful if you intend to take it as a supplement. You have to ease your body into it & only take a little at a time, like if you're trying to build an immunity to arsenic. Unknowingly, I took the recommended amount (jar, I trusted you!) & proceeded to have my insides torn apart.<br /><br />So, if you can remember these tips, you'll be well on your way to beautiful hair!

review/summary: Coconut Oil
review/text: I love this product. I use it three ways. First I use it as a daily skin moisturizer. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized all day without a heavy oily feel. I also use it as part of my hair regimen. I mix it with shea butter and jojoba oil to moisturize my natural locs. Finally, it is food grade. I use it as a spread on toast instead of butter and jams. It has a light sweet taste. Overall, I love this product and it is of high quality.

review/text: This coconut oil smells divine.  I love to use it for moisturizing my hair, since I am going natural, and am not quite ready for the big chop.  The oil is light, and I love it. Makes my hair smell so wonderful.
