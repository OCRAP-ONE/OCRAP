review/summary: Black Tiger: awesome | Jet Fuel: ehh
review/text: If you like your morning coffee dark and strong, with flavor that says "Hellllllo. Now get moving," and you're not scared of real coffee flavor, even if it means a tiny tiny amount of bitterness, then go for the Black Tiger. It is as advertised. It makes a tasty K-cup of coffee. Jet Fuel, on the other hand, is somewhat flavorless and bland. It's not "extra bold," as it is billed, by any stretch of the imagination. It's thin and bland, like a 7-11 or Dunkin Donuts "East Coast" style coffee. Stay away unless you are timid or faint-hearted.<br /><br />So avoid the variety pack and order a box of Black Tiger. Unless you like your coffee weak and bland -- and many people do even though they won't admit it but it's really the way they roll -- then fuel up with mislabeled Jet Fuel.

review/summary: My cats dig this
review/text: Petsmart no longer sells the 9Lives tuna so i have to buy a case online. My cats love all 3 tuna flavors, i love getting a case at a time i just dont like paying shipping. The pricing is a wash with buying the cans separately from wherever i can find them but adding shipping to the mix and i am in the hole. FedEx attempted delivery the next day, Saturday,  but since i wasnt home they didnt return until the next Tuesday. Very annoying.

review/summary: Excellent product, best deal around
review/text: This product is from Nutiva. Like other products from this company, it is of high quality. The seeds taste fresh. You have to put them in refrigerator after opening since they are moist and have oil contents. For unopened pouches, I suggest you put them in freezer to keep them fresh. The package is sturdy and seals the seeds very well and is re-sealable. The price on this listing is especially good (pack of 3 13-ounce pouches). You can compare the price per ounce with other listings. With the free shipping, it is the best price anywhere.

review/summary: Hempseed Products...Excellent!
review/text: This product was mentioned in David Wolfe's book, SUPERFOODS. It seems to be another fine way of getting protein in one's diet. I am trying for a nutritionally dense, calorically light diet for various scientific reasons. This product seems to assist me in this program. In fact, Hemp Seed, Hemp Oil, Hemp Protein Powder with fiber, all from the same company (Nutiva) are seemingly excellent as I've tried all for some months now. My workouts at the gym are going very well and I'm getting constant gains. I'm within 80% of my max weight achievments when I was 40 years old...I'm 62 now. For example, finally got to a 130lb. standing curl bar (was 150lb.) and 80lb. flat bench dumbbell press (was about 100lb.)...so, I'm pleased. Hope this helps, oh, buy Superfoods by D. Wolfe on Amazon.com and the other Hemp products too. RM

review/text: This is the first time I bought Nutiva Hempseed, so I bought the 13 0z. X 3 because I don't want to be stuck with 5 pounds of products in case I don't like them.<br /><br />It is true that the Nutiva hempseeds have more black pieces (shells) in them than some other brands I have tried (I learned this from an review of another Amazon purchaser). And the seeds are a bit smaller (I compare them side by side). But the taste and nutritional benefits seem to be the same.<br /><br />The Nutiva hempseeds are organic, whereas the Rocky Mountain hemp hearts are not.<br /><br />And price wise, the Nutiva brand is a bargain.

review/summary: Billing Complaint
review/text: You charged $18.22 each for two 180z jars.  There should have been a pack of four jars per item, thus two items should have been 8 jars.  I called your customer service people on 6/15 to bring this to their attention asking for an adjustment.  I was told I would hear by e-mail within 48 hours, and I was told there would be a credit to my Amex acount.  Neither of those two thing happened.<br />That product, Tap N Apple, sells for $4 and change per jar at competing on-line companies, and my last order from you was at that price.  In fact I just ordered 10 jars at that price from a competitor.  I want the charge to my Amex account adjusted.  If you do not respond, I will advise Amex to dispute the charge.<br />Sincerely,<br />Al Solomon

review/summary: Do not give to dogs with sensitive stomachs!!!!
review/text: I am a registered dietitian who ordered these for my black lab who has a sensitive stomach. I am a big fan of this line's other treats. They usually have very few ingredients and so I ordered these for our pup thinking they would be fine. BIG mistake!! When the package arrived I read the ingredients list and it has sorbitol in it...which is a sugar alcohol. This gives humans diarrhea very often but I tried giving her one just to see anyways. Huge huge huge mistake. She had diarrhea for 2 days straight every 20-40 minutes. I would not recommend these to any dog owner.

review/text: My Bichon really loves these and the reason we started using them is because they were made of entirely duck meat.  He has bad allergies and the duck jerky & sausages were a treat he could have.  Recently they have reformulated the product (sausage) and now they are using chicken liver in it.  I'm disappointed in this because we usually won't feed him beef or chicken.<br /><br />This supplier is great and received my order in just a few days.

review/summary: Best cheese curls - UPDATED: overpriced and poor quality
review/text: I won't say I'm an expert in cheese curls, but these sure taste great. Slightly milky flavor, and a touch of blue cheese give these an edge (literally and figuratively) over the competition. It's great that part of the ingredients are organic (I wish of course that they were all organic at this price). Don't be surprised when you open the bag, they fill just under a third of it. I guess the empty space keeps them in shape! Now the bad part, when you buy 12 at once you expect a discount. The Amazon price of $2.58 each is the same as at my local high priced natural food store. Still, nobody comes close flavor wise, although flavor is, of course, subjective.<br /><br />UPDATE December 11, 2009<br />Could I have been more disappointed with the makers of Cheese Curls? I stopped buying the baked cheese puffs from the same brand because the quality varies from one batch (by the expiration date) to another, and the last batch had too many puffs without cheese. Back to the curls, the previous batch (November) was just excellent (good flavor and crispiness as reported by my wife), but then came the one I bought just a week ago...there is not a single curl with proper cheese flavor in the bags. So why not complain? I am complaining, but the company doesn't care. I told them last year that the quality of the puffs varied from one batch to another, and it only got worse. The retail price has increased to $2.95 since then. At that price I expect a very good product, especially when I buy 12 at a time. Notice that it says on the back of the bag "freshness guaranteed." That's right, they don't care whether we're happy with the product, just that it's fresh. Thanks Michael Seasons, I guess I'll have to start making my own cheese curls (there is no other product on the market that uses (partially) organic ingredients). I'd give this one star today if I could.

review/summary: Five stars for the cheese flavored puffs
review/text: I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway.

review/text: My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown...

No. You deal with it, because despite the flaws, you like them.

review/summary: Amazing cheeze curls
review/text: I tried many times to find a replacement for Planters Cheeze Curls (now they discontinued it). And I think that is a perfect replacement. May be not only perfect but better than original from Planters. So, there is lot of cheeze powder on it and size is right and it's so delicious that when you'll put one curl in to you mouth you will involuntarily draw the next two.<br /><br />I'll recommend it for everyone who loved old time Planters Cheeze Curls - it's good and probably better.<br /><br />P.S.: I love them so much so I order them to Russia - total cost with delivery is about 75 dollars!

review/text: I'm a secret Cheeto addict, but these baked cheese curls are even more flavorful and addictive than the original.  And they are healthier, which makes them the perfect snack. No artificial cheese flavor, excellent crispy texture and sharp cheese taste.  I'm on my third case now and will continue to order this gem of a snack.  Worth a try if you love cheese curls.

review/summary: OMG These are the Best Cheese Snacks!
review/text: I found this brand of cheese snacks at a Whole Foods store in Manhattan and I've been hooked ever since. Unfortunately, WF started carrying their own brand of cheese puffs and stopped selling Michael Season's. Thank goodness for Amazon.com!<br /><br />I like these so much that I ordered a case and had them delivered to my office. Now all my office mates are getting hooked. These taste amazing for being "lite", and they have a decent amount of fiber per serving (and relatively low fat/calories). They are all natural, and highly addictive!<br /><br />I've tried the regular variety of Michael Season's Cheese Puffs, and I do not recommend them because they're too rich. The Lite variety taste perfectly cheesey without being too buttery in flavor.<br /><br />Makes an awesome afternoon snack!

review/summary: Clam Base
review/text: This Clam Base, besides being expensive, is not the best but it does the job intended, which is add clam flavor to culinary creations. Bought it because of the price but when I discovered it was only 8oz I realized why the low price tag. Worked fine on several dishes, a little intense in the sodium content but overall it delivered more quality of flavor. I normally buy Minor's Clam Base because it helps me to prepare a really fine seafood chowder. As of late I use the very same ingredients that go on a Boston Clam Chowder but I add lots of fresh seafood. It comes out creamy white, with diced potatoes, celery, onions, peas, carrots, corn and it taste very nice.<br />I used the Better than Boullion Clam Base for pasta dishes, soups and more, and it delivered to a certain point that special flavor that clam juice or base can only deliver. More like a 3.8 I settled on 4 Stars.

review/summary: We love most of the BTB's but...
review/text: Okay, I am a fairly new recruit to the "bases" for cooking.<br />They have some MSG, but no added/additional MSG, so the amounts have been<br />low enough to not cause problems. (My husband gets migraines from MSG.)<br /><br />We love most of the flavors, and I was anxious to try this one as well.<br />They don't carry anything but beef and chicken in our local stores, so all<br />the other flavors have to be purchased online. That makes them very expensive to use,<br />since the shipping is never cheap for these heavy little glass jars.<br /><br />I made a batch of New England style clam chowder last week and used the clam base.<br />I was looking forward to a real clam-intense flavor from the base that would be more<br />than the milk/cream combo. It was VERy disappointing. I used enough of the product, but<br />I would have had to double it to get any taste, in my opinion. I didn't want to do that,<br />since I don't know what other flavor tweak it might have caused to have double the recommended<br />amount.<br /><br />Over all, I love all the bases (the chili is amazing!), but the clam leaves a lot to be desired.<br />I also have a lobster, so the next time I make the chowder, I'll try it with lobster base instead.<br />This one is just too "blah" to be useful for very much.<br />I don't think I'll buy it again.

review/text: The quality is what you'd expect from a pickling salt. I prefer using this for brines as it dissolves in cold water.<br />4lbs of pickling salt is quite a bit, so if you're doing a lot of canning or pickling from summer-fall this is a good way to make sure you don't run out.<br /><br />There's not much bad to say about it, it's pickling salt. If you don't know what it is you probably shouldn't order it. If you do, it's the same you get from the grocery store, just in larger amounts.<br /><br />I'm happy with the price and the purchase. I still have quite a bit left and I don't see myself running out any time soon.

review/summary: Great salt, absurd price.
review/text: I have used this salt for years, but recently my local groceries have stopped stocking it.<br />On the one hand, it has a fantastic grain size for party mixes, popcorn, spice blends, and deserts. No iodine, and little anti-caking made is an easy choice for many recipes.<br /><br />On the other hand, this is not a specialty, gourmet salt. $11 for 8lb, is over TWICE the 2.11 per box I was paying at Safeway. Add shipping, and I'm sure there is a better choice.<br />Just grab any pure salt ( not Sea Salt please, unless it time traveled back from 50,000 B.C. ) and grind it by hand until it is very fine. Volia!

review/summary: Minerva Dairy Amish Hand Churned Butter Blocks
review/text: I shipped 2 lbs. of this butter in the block form to my father who wanted me to find "old-fashioned hand churned butter like they used to make." I like coming to Amazon b/c of the reviews which help me make better purchasing decisions. Sure glad I came across this product. My Dad absolutely loved it and wants me to order him 10 more lbs. of it!! It did my heart good to hear the excitement in his voice - the rediscovery of something nice from his childhood. He said it was creamy, had a really great flavor - just like butter used to be - not like the tasteless stuff they sell in the grocery stores. It spreads so easily - even when cold due to the higher fat content. The blocks have just the right amount of sea salt. Thank you Minerva Dairy for making a wonderful product and for feeding the cows all of the good food which produces such flavorful milk which translates into good old-fashioned tasting butter. Yummy! You won't be disappointed if you try this butter!

review/summary: We all need good fats
review/text: In my personal opinion, this butter is an excellent way to put essential fat into your diet, deliciously!  The value of good quality fat and oil in the diet is not only underrated, it is touted as 'bad' for you...that it will make you fat.  But it is far from the truth...the body needs good quality fat for proper functioning! It is the hydrogenated and heat processed fats that the body doesnt know what to do with so it is stored as 'fat'.  The movie "Lorenzo's Oil" had a profound effect on me regarding the healing power of natural oil, particularily in neurological conditions...and having a son with Asbergers (mild autism) again shows me how natural oil works in healing, though in his case it was with cold pressed Castor oil.  But less I digress further, let me just say this butter is wonderful!

review/text: I was pretty pleased when I tried this item after a recent food service show. There is a very strong chocolate smell and taste. One bar has 150 calories (30 from fat) and 9 grams of sugar (versus 16 in the old Cocoa puffs cereal and milk bars). The texture is different, it looks more like cocoa krispies than puffs and my jaw hurt from chewing so much but overall it is a nice option for people (especially kids) who don't have time to have a sit-down breakfast in the morning.

review/summary: Just what it says on the tin
review/text: As promised, this is one pound of granulated xylitol, ready to be used like sugar for all your mix-in and baking needs. (Just don't make yeasted bread with it; the yeast won't feed.) Xylitol is available from a variety of sources; this NOW Foods brand comes from cornhusks.<br /><br />Xylitol is a great alternative sweetener, especially with regard to oral health. The bacteria that harm your teeth can't feed on xylitol, and in fact they bind to the xylitol and it starves them, so it's not just harmless to your teeth, it's actually good for them. This makes it especially great for cooking snacks with or using it in coffee/tea/lemonade, or anywhere else that you might now be exposing yourself to cane sugar between toothbrushings. It's not as sweet as stevia, the other exceptionally tooth-friendly alternative sweetener, but it looks, tastes and behaves more like sugar, so it requires less adaptation (I keep both in my kitchen).<br /><br />I also highly recommend the xylitol-based Spry Dental Defense products (mints, gum, toothpaste, rinse).

review/text: Xylitol is available from a wide variety of sources.  It is a form of tree sugar, originally found in willow trees.  It has less calories than sucrose, and metabolizes differently.  You would need to consult with your physician if you are diabetic.<br /><br />One of the main attributes of xylitol is that is protects against tooth decay by changing the ph level to suppress bacteria causing both tooth decay and bad breath.  Rubbing xylitol against a tooth can give temporary relief from a toothache (but see your dentist).<br /><br />Xylitol is usually available in both granules and powder form.  Publications are sold separately giving directions for use in baking.

They still contain the artery-clogging amounts of fat (they are FRIED in palm oil, after all,) the high sodium and the whopping 380 calories per pack.<br /><br />However, these are Taiwanese-style noodles, which are a little thinner and have somewhat more flavor - good enough to eat dry. They also contain two packets of seasoning. One of sesame oil, and one of chicken flavor with sesame seeds. In all, a hard on the body but oh-so-tasty edible. Just don't eat them for every meal!

review/summary: BEST SOUP I HAVE HAD IN A LONG TIME
review/text: This is the best soup I have had in a long time, without going for takeout.<br />the noodles are thinner but plenty, and there is a seasoning package and a sesame oil package also,and they are not skimpy packets either. I love the easy use of the product. I have a hot/cold water dispenser, and so i put everything into the bowl that's in the package add 2 cups of hot water and cover with a paper towel and in 4-5 min. delicious soup.<br />and I also like the fact that the soup is in foil type packages,and not paper<br />this is a very good price for the quantity and also delicious everyone i gave some to just loves it too,especially my wife. I will buy this again and again. Try this you will be happy you did!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: Treat this product with respect!
review/text: This "dieting" teas may sounds pretty benign since it's a "tea", but I strongly suggest you treat Ballerina tea as though it was the strongest laxatives you'll ever use.  Don't plan on being to far away from a restroom after you first take this product. And don't plan any long drives until you're aware of how this will impact you.<br /><br />These product is call "Ballerina" tea cause a Ballerina would use this to crap their way back down in weight. And that's exactly what it does, and it does it well.  I use this when I feel my overlying illness is impacting my regularity.  Drink a cup in the early afternoon and you'll be back to regularity with overdrive by the time the day is out.  Drink a small cup on a regular basis and you should be "cleaned out" in a matter of days...and you'll have an extra benefit of walking, cheeks tucked in and clinched, while trying to make it to the bathroom

review/summary: Best Senna Tea I've Used Yet
review/text: I've tried a lot of senna teas. I have kind of a bad digestive system, and tend to get bloated or even constipated a lot.<br /><br />However I either a.)gag to death over most senna teas, or b.) get sick from them.<br /><br />However this was perfect :] strong enough to do what it is supposed to, but not strong enough to make me ill.<br /><br />Also out of all the senna teas I've tried this one is the MOST TOLERABLE. And I HATE the taste of senna but I didn't even gag on this. All of the "Smooth Move" senna teas make me want to vomit drinking them.<br /><br />I've been taking this every 3 to 4 days and it is great. Idk if it's really a "diet" tea without it being overused as a laxative but it probably definitely could make you lose some weight from flushing you out more efficiently.<br /><br />In short, this tea has made me feel muchhhh more comfortable and better about myself in general. Feels much nicer going out NOT feeling bloated and gross, am I right?

I think,it doesn't work as a way to lose your weight. As for me, who has a normal weight, it works as a helper for my digestive system. Anyway, it's the best way for me to be healthy.

review/summary: It is pretty good.
review/text: Well I started drinking this tea a couple of years ago, but had to stop when the local Asian market stopped carrying it.  I had forgotten the name of it until it just recently popped into my head and decided to look it up on amazon.  Here it is!  I loved this tea. :-)  BE WARNED!!!! The first 1-3 days, you will need to be near a restroom.  The "cleansing" effect will have you running for the hills, but wears off after continued use.  Pros: It tastes good, It helped me fall asleep faster, made me feel better during the day(less bloated), and overall nicely priced. Cons: Well obviously the first couple of days.  Once you start, it is not meant for an "on again-off again" kind of thing, and as for the "diet", well nothing is going to be a miracle. You have to exercise and lower your food intake. Plain and simple.

review/summary: Best Kept Secret - this tea is AWESOME!
review/text: I had unbearable cramps and diarhea the first time I drank it ... ended up that one tea bag was waaaay to much for me, so now, I brew a whole cup of this tea, and a whole cup of camomile (but you can use any other type too), then I take only HALF of cup of THIS tea and mix it with a full cup of the camomile ... works like a charm - no diarheea, no cramps, just does what it's supposed to in 6 hours!  Its true this tea is very potent, so a full dose may be too much for some like me.  Just play around with it and find your sweet spot.  From time to time, I take meds that bind me up terribly and this tea has been a life saver, nothing works like it!

review/summary: I prefer the extra strength version
review/text: This is a good tea but I have been using it for a few years now so I guess my stomach is a bit used to it. I find that the Extra Strength version of this tea works best for me (I use 2 bags) if i need a really good cleaning. If I take it at night it usually kicks in 12 hrs later (around noon or so) and keeps me running to the bathroom until about 5pm. I guess the regular strength is good for mild constipation, it wont have the extreme cleaning effect like extra strength but that's just my experience, it may work differently for others. Great Brand, will buy again but next time will look for the Extra Strength. I use this tea about 1-2x a week. This tea can give you cramps when ur ready to go but it was not nearly as bad as other teas or laxatives I have taken in the past. I recommend this to anyone who wants a good cleaning or anyone who suffers from constipation.

review/text: This is coming from a real woman, and real matters. It's 5:31am and I am writing this. I had literally had diarrhea all night. Though none of you, need to know this. BUT, this is warning. This Tea has senna in it, a laxative. You will be getting the worst cramps, and diarrhea of your life! I have used it for two days, and feel horrible. I recommend regular herbal tea guys! I'm being totally honest, I am NOT using this product again. It doesn't even prove to help in weight loss. And the side effects are killer, and totally not worth it. Believe me, I wanted the easy way out, drink tea, and maybe cut back my diet. BUT, this tea is not what I intended. I wish not to spend another night on the toilet, practically keeling over.

review/summary: Decent, mild pre-workout from BSN
review/text: I have tried many, many pre-workout powders over the past few years so I thought I would start writing reviews to help consumers by giving my personal experience with all the supplements I have tried.<br />PROS:<br />-Mild stimulant for those looking for just a little extra kick.<br />-Label specifies amount of caffeine (270 mg/serving) there are very few supplements that specify actual amount of caffeine.<br />-Affordable for tight budgets.<br />-Taste is not the best but tolerable compared to some.<br />-No creatine if you don't want/like creatine in your pre-workout.<br />-Not as many ingredients as some others, so to me, less ingredients= less fillers and additives. (In most cases)<br />CONS:<br />-No Nitric Oxide ingredients from what I read. (L-Arginine, etc.) I had to stack with my N.O. supplement (Nitrix) to get a pump.<br />-No creatine if you want creatine in your pre-workout.<br />-Too much sodium, which may make you feel slightly bloated sometimes.<br /><br />I recommend this product to those on a tight budget and are looking for a little bit of an energy kick before lighter workouts. For those who need a real pump and a smack in the face for their workouts, I suggest a stronger pre-workout.

review/summary: Amazing workouts
review/text: I've been working out 5 days a week for the past 2+ years. By now working out has just become routine. I've never tried a pre-workout before because I work at starbucks and my routine has always been black coffee before a workout. I picked the blue raz up from GNC where my boyfriend works and I felt the difference instantly. I didn't get the crazy tingling sensation from it which I expected but the pump it gives me is intense. I went from running two miles a day with fatigue to being able to run 4 miles with the help of hyper FX without the fatigue that I naturally feel. I feel with the help and the push of this product, I can once again lose the last 15 pounds that I've been struggling to lose for about 6 months now. I'm afraid to taste the fruit punch one because it's not my favorite flavor, but I'll probably try it next. The blue raspberry flavor is incredibly delicious. 2 thumbs way, way up for this product!

review/summary: This stuff is beast!
review/text: I've been working out and playing a variety of sports at the competitive level for years. I've tried many different energy drinks and supps and have developed a tolerance for caffeine. I bought this with an open mind but not expecting much. Hyper FX kicked my butt! I took the recommended serving size of 1 scoop and within about 10 minutes I could feel it kick in. I ended up doing a 12 round workout on the heavy bag and ran for 4 miles, and still had plenty enough energy that I could've done more but I ACTUALLY RAN OUT OF TIME! That's right, this stuff kept me jacked for nearly 2 hours of exercise and I would've done more but simply didn't have enough time alloted in my day. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to sleep that night (I took this at around 9 am) but it finally did wear off after I ate lunch. I'm only going to take this once or twice a week on days that I want to do a long, intense workout session and have the time to devote to a workout like that. I'm worried that I might develop a tolerance to it if I take it more often, so just a couple times a week for me. But this stuff works better than any other "energy" supplement I've tried. The blue raz flavor tastes decent, but I wish they'd make this in the green apple flavor, like their N.O. Xplode 2.0

review/text: Strong stuff here. Not for the novice by any means. This product should be taken with LOTS of caution. For someone who is an avid exercise enthusiast and not sensitive to caffein in the least, one whole scoop will do fine. For the individual looking for a little boost, half a scoop or less in a small amount of water is fine. I gave this product 3 stars only because I think it could be dangerous to those who are expecting a little boost to help with their exercise program and aren't aware of the 200+mg's of caffeine. Take at your own risk.<br /><br />On the positive side, it gets the job done! Great focus and energy throuout.

review/summary: Hot Pepper in the Mix, Watch Out!
review/text: Wow, I have tried about every energy supplement you can think of and this one just plain sucks.  The energy is ok, not terrible, but ok.  Definitely not BEAST as some reviews have said.  Not even close.  Plus, it tastes horrible and I am the last person to complain about taste.  My wife spent a half hour on the toilet after taking it both times she tried it.  My son nearly puked from it and I couldn't stop the burning in my mouth from the chucks of hot pepper which never desolved anytime I used it over the one week I forced myself to try this.  Horrible.<br /><br />I am using Man Sports Game Time right now and it rocks.  Craze is great.  Athletic Edge Presurge is pretty good.  HyperFX went in the trash.

review/summary: Meh....
review/text: Not bad for a pre-workout supplement I guess. I've had better though. It does nothing to increase strength or endurance in my opinion. It does however, make you feel like you CAN do more, even though when you try, you can't. I feel focused and energetic if I take this lilke an hour before the workout. I still get winded quickly though, and I don't see any strength gains (It's only been two weeks though).<br /><br />When you mix it, it smells horrible. Like somebody stuffed old cheese in a dirty gym sock, then hosed it down with raspberry perfume. Then beat you upside the head with it. It's actually embarassing to mix in my office because my co workers can smell it. Lucky for BSN, the taste isn't nearly as bad. Though I wouldn't say it's "great". It almost tastes carbonated as well.<br /><br />Also, for about the first week, you'll most likely go through an adjustment period. This stuff goes right through you. Like literally 15 minutes into drinking it, you'll feel like you're going to crap your pants. In fact, if you're not careful, you just might. I feel like I may crap my pants right now as I write this. And I just started drinking it. You get used to it, but the first week is kinda miserable. It makes your stomach ache and growl.<br /><br />I dunno, for the price, not bad. package is a lot smaller than I expected, but the servings are a lot smaller than I expected too.<br /><br />I've tried N.O. Xplode, which I prefer to this stuff. N.O. Xplode makes you hyper but has kinda the same adjustment period.

review/summary: NRG = SPEED
review/text: This is the best speed ever.<br />It replaces No Xplode Single packets. The energy level is amazing and fat burner extreme.<br />If you are sensitive, I mean one cup of coffee wires you then beware.<br /><br />Note to the small minded: It's not a narcotic.
