review/text: With a spoonful of honey, this is simply delicious. The smell is slightly strong at first (but not unpleasant) but the taste is smooth and very unique. It also has some rose I believe. I drink this tea every evening and I usually have to force myself to drink tea for the antioxidants because I don't usually like tea. This is different, however. A touch of honey is all you need. Perfect.

review/summary: Tried for first time last night
review/text: I tried this flour for the first time last night. Amazing results. I have been making homemake pizza for 20+ years now and always used bread or high-gluten flour. (Mostly King Arthur).<br /><br />In the past I have read about using Italian "00" flour but have not tried it. King Arthur offers "00" flour but I always thought the protien content was tool low, looked more like cake flour then something I would want to use for pizza.<br /><br />Surfing the other day I came across this flour and read about how much people loved it for making pizza. Seeing that it had a higher protien content (11% compared to KA's 8.5%) I though I would give it a try.<br /><br />Well based on last nights results I'm a fan and may never go back to HG flour again for pizza.<br /><br />The dough was very easy to work with (you will not be tossing this dough) very soft and easy to work with.<br /><br />I used the following bakers percentages:<br /><br />Italian "00" flour 100.00% (1 lb 4 oz approx 4.5 cups)<br />Water  57.00% (11.4 oz - approx 1.333 cups)<br />IDY  0.17%  (.03 oz - approx .333 tsp)<br />Salt, Fine  3.00%  (.6 oz - approx 1 tbsp)<br /><br />I use two 16 Oz balls for two 14" pizza

review/summary: Great results always, pizza or Ciabatta
review/text: I originally bought this flour for pizza dough when I bought two heavy baking stones for my oven.  I was a total novice at the time, and the pizza dought came out superb.  This is indeed the flour that is required for a true Neopolitan pizza, according to the international standard promulgated in Naples.  When I found that I had a decent mastery of pizza dough, I decided to try my hand at baking ciabatta bread.  Once one acquires the discipline to actually follow the recipe, even though the hydration ratio seems impossibly high; and once one has the confidence to attempt what seems like folding water, one will be rewarded with a truly magnificent ciabatta.  The texture, the elasticity, and the airiness of the crumb are perfect, and the nutty flavor is addictive.  I can't recommend this flour highly enough.

review/text: This is what you need if you want to make not good, not great but beyond amazing pizza dough. I've been making pizza for a decade and I thought I know what I was doing and what to use... and then, I tried this flour. Wow! Big deference: it has more elasticity to it so makes for easier tossing, and then the taste... poems should be written about the taste.<br />I've learned about Antimo Caputo "00" flour on Taylor's Ultimate episode - the ultimate pizza, it's where he goes to NYC, then to Italy, Naples and learns how to make pizza dough. The Italian woman who is teaching him shows him this flour and says that this is the only kind that pizzerias throughout Naples use. `Nuff said.

review/text: I took a cooking class when I visited Rome last year, and one of the things we made was fresh pasta.  The chef/instructor explained that in Italy flour is classified as either as type 1, 0, or 00. This scale refers to how finely ground the flour is and how much of the bran and germ have been removed.  The scale has nothing to do with the protein content - that is dependent on the type of wheat. Doppio Zero is the most highly refined - it resembles talcum powder - and is the choice of Italians for making both pizza and pasta.<br /><br />After learning how easy it is to make pasta, I bought a pasta maker the minute got home, and have spent the past year perfecting my skills at making it - it's so fun and easy once you get the knack.  I've been using all-purpose and semolina flours (or a blend of both) to make fresh pasta, and have been very happy with the results, but I decided to splurge on the authentic stuff.  The first batch I made with the 00 flour took me back to that cooking class in Rome and the amazing silken pasta we made that day - the texture is noticeably different.  I've also used the double-zero flour to make pizza dough, and the resulting crust was simply over the top.<br /><br />All-purpose flour is a perfectly acceptable substitute for authentic Italian 00 flour, and it certainly costs a lot less, but if you're ready to take your pizza and pasta making skills to the next level, you owe it to yourself to give it a try.

review/summary: Excellent pizza flour
review/text: Caputo has a reputation as being the best for pizza.  I my experience it's well deserved.  The dough is silky smooth, easy to stretch and tastes great.<br />I use a dead simple formula,  1000 g (one bag) Caputo,  630 grams water (63%),  20 grams sea salt and say 10 g of IDY.  I get 8 210 gram balls which make 10-12 inch bases for use in a wood fired oven.  The crust gets rave reviews.<br /><br />beats anything I've bought at the supermarket (including KA all purpose).  Haven't tried KA's 00 since I'm happy with Caputo and KA's is no cheaper after shipping.<br /><br />This 10 bag price isn't too bad on price.  I'd prefer a 50 lb bag, but the shipping is death.

review/summary: Taylor's Market Great Customer Service and Value
review/text: My order from Taylor's Market showed up pretty fast with regular shipping. I even ordered with my old address and didn't realize it until the day after. I called them and they fixed it right away and in a friendly manner, which I really appreciated. Oh yeah Antimo Caputo il migliore farina da Napoli e' stato buonissima! - of course the flour's really good. People who say all flours are the same, sort of have a point, but Italian cooking has a lot to do with the ingredients - if you want to capture that sapore. Foodies that say it's the best flour in the world for pizza may get your hopes up a little(all though it may be - I think at least for bread a lot of it has to do with what you mix it with, the oven's heat, and how much you let it rise.) A skilled pizzaiolo can make a good pizza with anything and for a guy that only dabbles in the dough Caputo makes the task easier.<br />Caputo Rossa has the Italian taste that you're missing in the states. It's easy to find Garofalo pasta and Illy etc...etc..., but high quality 00 farina is kind of a pain even in NYC. Tonight, my pizza came out with more bubbles than usual. Tomorrow I'm going to make some pasta with it. If the price stays the same, I'm gonna keep my cabinets filled with Caputo from Taylor's Market year round. Buon appetito! Mangia bene...

review/text: Made basic pizza dough from this flour and was taken aback by the rise of the dough.  I made a simple Margherita pizza with San Marzano tomatoes and this dough on the grill using the Lodge cast iron pizza pan and I thought I was back in Italy. My results using typical American flour were always disappointing.  If you want authentic Italian style pizza, you must use Italian ingredients. I love this flour and have it on autoship.

review/summary: Finally, perfect pizza dough!
review/text: I don't know what changed but I was no longer able to make a decent pizza dough using King Arthur flour even with dough conditioner.<br /><br />After a several year hiatus I thought I'd give pizza making another try and I bought this flour.  I watched a large number of videos of how to make pizza dough but in the end I decided to take a slightly different route.<br /><br />I found that all of the recipes are unnecessarily complex.  I add approximately 600 grams of flour to about 1 1/2 cups of water, 1/2 teaspoon of yeast and 1 teaspoon of ordinary salt. I don't add any oil or sugar.<br /><br />I knead the dough using a Kitchen Aid mix with a dough hook and add flour until the dough is no longer sticky. I knead the dough at low speed for about 5 minutes.  This flour rapidly develops a very smooth consistency.  You don't have to knead it for longer amounts of time.<br /><br />I then let the dough rise in a covered bowl for 2-4 hours and punch it down to remove all the air bubbles.<br /><br />I divide the dough into 2 even pieces forming a ball. I put the balls into a very lightly oiled large covered plastic container and let it rise in the refrigerator for a minimum of 24 hours.  Rising the dough in the refrigerator is critical. The dough seems to get wetter when it rises in the refrigerator so if your dough is a little bit on the dry side after kneading, don't worry about it.<br /><br />The dough stretches out beautifully. It doesn't tear and you can make it paper thin (but I wouldn't recommend it).<br /><br />I've been using a BBQ unit to bake the pizza. I get the BBQ unit up to around 800 degrees and the pizza cooks in just a few minutes.  I've also cooked in an oven at 550 degrees and while the bake time is longer, the pizza still comes out perfectly.<br /><br />I drizzle a bit of olive oil on the cheese.  This give the cheese a nice stretchy texture. Don't add too much sauce or you'll get soggy pizza.<br /><br />Where I live, there isn't a single place that serves a decent NYC style pizza.  Mine comes close.

review/text: My wife and I ran out of cumin. Where we used to live, grocery stores had bulk aisles where you could buy lots of cumin for not lots of money. Here, the same amount sets you back close to the cost of a meal at a nice restaurant. Obviously, a solution was needed.<br /><br />I searched around and found two pounds of cumin on sale from Frontier. Prime shipping, no tax, why not? I clicked "order" and didn't think about it until I got home from a business trip and noticed two massive bags sitting on the kitchen table. I'm not sure exactly how much I thought I was buying, but two pounds of cumin is a lot. I'm pretty sure I won't need to be needing to buy cumin for the next two to three years. In fact, I might be able to sell some to my local grocer and supply them for the next two to three years as well.<br /><br />That said, the quality is fantastic. Lightly toasted and put through the spice grinder, and there is a noticeable improvement over generic supermarket cumin. The price and quality are both fantastic.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good way to go if you need some cumin - especially if you need a lot of cumin. Share some with your mother, grandmother, aunts, uncles, neighborhood watch society - whoever... you'll have plenty. But even if you keep it all for yourself, you'll be glad you ordered.

review/summary: mmmmmm pink and punchy
review/text: Taste strongly  of vanilla cinnamon and cherries.  Quite sweet like a dessert wine even though the bottle says semi sweet. Taste great with cheddar cheese and grilled food like kabobs and burgers. I guess the guy at the store said it taste even better if you put slices of orange in it. You can also make really killer cocktails with it by mixing orange juice and rum. ( I didn't try it. Cuz I am not a cocktail person) Very light and perfect for summer and fall. Reminds me of a Catawba or a White Zinfandel.Great for a bathtub companion or a get together. Will leave you and the people you share it with smiles all around. It is under ten dollars , but doesn't taste it.<br />Please serve extremely chilled for several hours. It is undrinkable at room temp.

review/summary: Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!
review/text: Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china.<br /><br />Per ABC News;<br />Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.<br /><br />The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: A Treat My Dog Loves
review/text: Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.

review/summary: Three out of Three Dogs plus one Cat love these
review/text: I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well-behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.<br /><br />These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.<br /><br />The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.<br /><br />These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four-legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.

review/text: My 3-year old Akita is very picky when it comes to food, and usually refuses most of the standard dog treats. This is the only thing he visibly appreciates; BTW, when offered Chicken Happy Hips of the same brand he's not as interested.<br /><br />The only downside is the price; don't ever buy it in retail stores - they charge 2-3 times more than online retailers. Even then it's rather expensive.<br /><br />Hope this helps.

review/summary: GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!
review/text: My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.

review/text: My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.

Our vet recommended we switch to a duck and potato dog food, which we did. All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them. We've been buying them monthly on Amazon's subscribe and save program and all our dogs look forward to their daily treat. You can buy this product with confidence.

review/summary: Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other
review/text: I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

I have yet to meet any pup who doesn't love these treats both for the chewy, crunchy needs that dogs need, but also for the total nutrition it provides.  If you are worried about the latest pet food recalls from China, these treats have never had to be recalled.

review/summary: Dog Won't Eat Them
review/text: My dog loves chicken breast treats. That is, until I bought these. I'm sure this is simply a matter of taste. I don't know if the additives smell different or what's turning him off but he'll pick it up and then just drop it. He refuses to eat them at all.

review/text: We've been buying happy hips for a while - online and at stores. I feel that if I'm going to give my dog a treat, one that's closest to something "healthy" should be it. My dogs LOOOOOOVE them, I think it's their fav. Treat by far. I'm subscribed to Amazon's delivery so you do get them for a little less money and you don't have to think about going online and buying them, you will automatically get them. I love that feature - would recommend using it if you buy these regularly.

review/text: I have 3 very active McNab...working cow dogs.  The oldest two have shown a vast improvement in their flexibility and agility.  Kessler and Hootie are "just like new", and they are 13 and 14 years old!  Rita, our 4 year old loves Happy Hips too.  I think it's good to start them on these while they are young. These "treats" are so pure and nutritious.  I don't ever give my guys rawhide, but like rawhide, the Happy Hips are a little tough to chew and that helps clean their teeth.  Our guys like the duck as well as the chicken.  I'd like to recommend that you subscribe to these so you don't ever run out!  I get a monthly shipment of each flavor and we're good to go!  Thank you Happy Hips for helping my guys live a happy, flexible life!<br /><br />Deb Phelan<br />San Luis Obispo, California

review/summary: My dog is addicted!!!
review/text: My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)

review/text: I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.

review/text: Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.

review/summary: Not so sure because
review/text: I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?

review/summary: Great made in China product for dogs.
review/text: I've noticed that quite a few people don't seem to believe the labels of products made in China, when it is usually a U.S. company that dictates what goes into the product.  Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China.

review/text: I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......
