review/summary: Nice, sure...but nutritious?
review/text: These are nice and at $28, a good value.  They taste yummy and are pretty satisfying.  They're vegan, preservative free, and have only a half gram of monounsaturated fat each.  My only issue is that the calories are a bit high and the nutrients a bit low.  Each (appx) 5x3" cracker is 70 calories and has only 2 grams of fiber.  Aside from phosphorous and magnesium (6 and 4% RDA respectively) the only health benefit is 2 grams each of protein and iron.  For a cracker, they are pretty filling but it's still easy to go through a LOT of calories in a short time.  With a thick, no-sugar spread a couple of these would probably suffice for a heavy breakfast or light lunch.

review/summary: Fruit Crunch is better - in my opinion
review/text: I've been a Ryvita fan for a number of years, and the Fruit Crunch version is my favorite. They are just sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth (and keep me from making a disasterous vending machine raid) and filling enough so that I can get by eating 1 or 2. I don't need any spreads or goop on the cracker....they are fine without. Anyway, I thought I'd try these Fruit & Seed Crunch crackers since amazon had a Friday promotion. The currants are much smaller and not even obvious vs larger pieces in the Fruit Crunch that add some pleasant chewiness. The seeds aren't plentiful...these taste more like a sweetened rye cracker. If given the choice, I'd still choose Fruit Crunch over Fruit & Seed Crunch.

review/summary: Are these supposed to be blackened?
review/text: Not what I expected, nothing like the illustration on the package.  I have enjoyed Ryvita products previously, but will not purchase this item again. Two seeds and one raisin per brick of corrugated meal do not make the pain of eating one of these worthwhile. Food should not break into shards and try to stab you. Also, the image suggests that the product is toasty golden.  No evidence given of fireblasted blowtorch charring. Tag suggestions: good god I can't feel the roof of my mouth.

review/summary: At least you "feel" like you are eating something healthy
review/text: My first taste and I was disappointed.  I and a daughter have gone through 4 boxes at this point and this is what I've found:<br /><br />Taste is like those huge pillows of shredded wheat cereal pounded down into a hard, thick crackery crispbread.  Not even close to the amount of seeds in the picture and maybe 1 or 2 currants per crispbread.  The added brown sugar gives it the allusion of being sweetened with currants when they are so "absent" that the sweetness is definitely the sugar.  I've found 1, possibly 2 currants per cracker.  Needed at least a tiny bit of sodium as is lacking in taste.  It's much more blackened..much...than the picture which I suppose hides the fact it has very few seeds.<br /><br />It tastes best microwaved for about 15 to 20 seconds then covered with a thin layer of cream cheese.  Doing this makes it a tasty treat.  But then covering anything in cream cheese makes it a tasty treat.  Not enough nutritional value and taste for me to purchase something so odd like this again, unfortunately.

review/summary: Better Than Bread
review/text: These crackers are quite unique.  Interesting that they are called "Fruit and Seed Crunch," because the only fruit in the product is 14% currants, which adds a bit of a tang to the taste, nothing else.  As a Vegan treat, these are quite satisfying.  I smear some peanut butter on two; and that's breakfast.<br /><br />Imported from Great Britain, these crackers are made with whole grain rye and wheat flour and then lightly dusted with pumpkin and sunflower seeds.  Honestly, one of these things is quite filling.  The fiber content is good, too.<br /><br />As part of a healthy diet plan, these crackers are excellent.  Substitute these for bread and see how you like it!

review/text: As a nutritionist and author,I was always looking for a quality cracker, one with fiber and flavor.  Ryvita Fruit Crunch is it! I've been recommending this cracker to my clients forever, and was shocked to learn that recently they were no longer carried in supermarkets.  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I bought a pack of ten boxes and have been giving them to my clients --and of course keeping some for myself.  Remember that two crackers is the equivalent of having a slice of bread when you have them with perhaps a cup of tomato soup, an ounce of cheese and a little salad for lunch or dinner.

review/text: Ryvita Fruit and Seed Crunch crispbreads are not too sweet but not so dry and dissicated that you want to smother it in peanut butter (although they taste great with PB!!!).  I eat these straight up as a snack at work or with a morning cup of coffee/tea.  Just the right amount of crunch and sweet.  Lots of fiber and lower in carbs than many others.  Can not beat these crunchy crackers.

review/summary: Looks NOTHING like the box picture!! No seeds or goodies on cracker!
review/text: I can't stand false advertising >:-(<br />The crackers are two mostly plain solid layers with stuff in between. I think there may be some seedy and fruity things inside, in between the layers...not really consistent fruit 'filling', but just randomly distributed small fruit/seed bits. Cracker tastes good when your bite happens to catch a fruit thing, but that happens like 3x per a cracker.  (Each cracker is the size of a regular index card.)<br /><br />Basically, CRACKERS ARE NOT SINGLE LAYER COVERED BY TONS OF SEEDS AND FRUIT BITS like you see in the picture!!!  Don't expect that!<br /><br />With that said, they weren't that bad.  NOT sweet (unfortunately), and taste kinda fibery.  Pretty regular dry healthy crackers.  They are not filling, unless you tend to be filled up by index-card sizes of crispy dry whole wheat bread.  But they may help curb your appetite for a short while?<br />I enjoyed them of cheese and honey on top :-) Yummy.<br /><br />Summary:<br />- cracker= 2plain layers with very little fruit/seed bits in between<br />- feels healthy<br />- tastes okay.

review/text: Well... looks like hamster food, smells like hamster food, oh yeah and it TASTES like hamster food!  These crispbread crackers are nothing short of disgusting.  Health food does not mean that it needs to taste bad! I find nothing wrong with all-natural foods that actually taste good.  There are plenty of alternatives that offer whole grain and fiber and are much more flavorful.  The no sodium aspect is difficult to ignore but unless your tastebuds have suffered some sort of great catastophre than I warn you to look elsewhere for something more palatable...

review/text: On my last trip to Costco, I picked up a 26-oz. bag of Wild Roots coastal berry blend trail mix. It consists of almonds and cashews along with dried blueberries, cranberries and yogurt chips, It's somewhat high in fat and calories, but it's good vegetable fat. The taste is quite excellent. It's a good product and my only gripe was that the nuts were a bit stale, although the product had an expiration date of Feb. 2013. Well, the Trail Mix was good enough that I bought a second bag at Costco and it was nice and fresh and quite excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Before he got to them, I had about half a bottle one afternoon while we were playing with our kids.  I sat down on the couch and ended up taking a nap (which is something I never ever do).  Guess I should have read the label first!  I thought it would just relax me, not put me to sleep - so now I drink a half bottle before bed.  Sounds cheesy, but it quiets my anxious mind.  I sleep SO well with this tea and I wake up feeling happy and refreshed (not weighed down and grumpy as I usually am in the morning).  Keep in mind, I'm a lightweight at 117lbs and 5'4.<br /><br />NOTE:  I found this at the store at 1.50/bottle... I'm really bummed that Amazon jacked up the price here.

review/text: The flavoring is very good, not harsh at all and very easy to drink. However I can go down to my local grocery and get it at $1.50  a bottle, still making it much cheaper for a 12 pack there.

review/text: I was given this by my daughter in law, and it works as I slept through the night, rare for me. Plus it is sweet nectar.  She bought it for me from a party store.  Your price is high in comparison to the party store.  1.79 a bottle vrs 2.60 per bottle when bought in a case of 12 for 31.19. I'm tempted to pay it, but will check out the local stores first.

review/summary: Nothing like it!
review/text: I visited my mom in California over the holidays and she had some of this in her fridge. One night I decided to try it. Usually I get on the laptop and stay up for hours researching whatever might be on my mind...usually until 2 or 3 in the morning! While drinking this tea I fell asleep in the middle of my research before 10pm, before even finishing the bottle! I finally went to bed and had the best night's sleep. I woke up at 730ish and never felt so refreshed that early (I'm obviously not a morning person).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the prices here are a bit high, and I don't think I can get these where I live. In my opinion, though, unless you can find them locally for cheaper, the $31 is still very much worth it!

review/text: I have to get up at 4AM, and the longer the days get, the more difficult it is to fall asleep at a reasonable hour. Not with these wonderful tasting drinks! I am out cold within an hour. . . tops. I have tried Neuro, Zen Serenity, and now these, and these are the best by far (taste, effectiveness, etc.). I wake up feeling great; not like when you take a sleeping pill. Also, I ordered from Marely's (I assume this was a typo), and their customer service was SUPERB when I had a slight issue. As far as the price, a night's worth of sleep without taking a pharmaceutical drug, is worth every penny to me.

review/summary: Both Tasty and a Great Sleep Aid
review/text: The only problem that I have with this item is that it does not in fact put you in a mellow mood. It knocks you out completely. Within an hour of drinking this, I have a really hard time staying awake. That's why I purchased it though, to relax and eventually help get me to sleep. I have also not noticed any side effects with my sleep, when drinking this multiple nights in a row and then stopping, like most sleep aids.<br /><br />It is also really tasty. It holds up extremely well against any other fruit beverage. This may be a con though as constantly wanting to drink a beverage that knocks you out can't be good for your social or work life.

review/text: I didn't know that this drink did more than just taste good the first time I drank it. I knocked out (fell asleep!) The taste is great, and we prefer the Black Tea over the green tea version. It is hard to find but we have found it at Sprouts Market and also some Shell Gas Stations. Check MMM's website for Store Locators. Walmart also sells it online but my local Sprouts store is cheaper than any online outlet so far. Good drink! Wish they also made the drink without the sleep effects.

review/text: Recently found Bob Marley's tea at a few select stores. It is very refreshing and has a nice clean taste to it. It is very relaxing but in no way put  me out. I can drink it any time of the day. I tried both the black tea and the green. The green one is the best and it is sweet but not too sweet. I thought I might be able to get a better deal on Amazon but doesn't come close to the $1.50 or $1.70 that I find them for.

review/summary: Delicious, but not a "knock out"
review/text: This is by far the best TASTING sleep drink I've had. In fact, I find myself frequently wishing they made a "non drowsy" formula so I could sip it during the day, it's really that good! However, if you're a full blown insomniac (such as myself) looking for 8 hours of sleep in a bottle, this may not be for you. It's great if you need to catch a long nap, like 3-4 hours, but if you're looking for a full night's sleep I recommend Neurosleep! A little pricier, but that will take you out for a good 7-8 hours.

review/summary: Bob Marley?
review/text: I bought this from my local grocery store just to see what it was about. Looked cool, and I drank a few sips as the can said it might make you drowsy. I definitely felt a "head change" the first time i drank it, and immediately went for a red bull to balance out the effects. That night I was having trouble sleeping and was laying awake at 1:30am. I remembered I still had a can of this in the fridge and drank the whole thing.. Within 10 minutes I was out.<br /><br />Just recently I bought this again in case I needed help sleeping (I sometimes have insomnia). I drank half a can and about an hour later (around 2:30pm) I was laying in bed taking a nap. I actually fell asleep on my back, which I NEVER do; always on my side or stomach.<br /><br />Personally, I dont think it should be a "Bob Marley" product, as Mike Tyson would be more suitable - since it will knock you out cold.

review/summary: Better than a sleeping pill until you become tolerant
review/text: This really knocks you out and gives you great sleep without feeling any hangover. It's amazing. (It's also quite tasty, kinda like Snapple only if you drink too much you turn into Rip Van Winkle.) A family member recommended it and I'm glad I tried it. I wish it wasn't so expensive and more available though. Often, Amazon is out of stock and nowhere else on their website is listed as a seller.<br /><br />Update: I've noticed that since I started drinking this every once in a while when I have sleep issues, even if months have lapsed at a time, I've become more tolerant to the effects of the drink. (I found this, also, when I took Valerian pills directly. Valerian root is one of the ingredients.) So one bottle or two doesn't really put me to sleep anymore. This might just be me but I'd suggest not using it too often to avoid becoming tolerant. Just use it when you really need it...which I do but I tend to become tolerant to things very quickly. I wouldn't mind if the cost wasn't so exorbitant. Drinking two bottles a night can become pretty pricey if I'm having a week of insomnia. The thing is despite the price this does really beat the side effects of a lot of the sleep aids out there and trust me, I've tried A LOT of them. This is great for once in a while when your sleep schedule gets out of whack.<br /><br />Also, I discovered that Walmart sells the drink for $20! And it ships free if you purchase more than $45 so it's worth going over to Walmart to get 3 cases at a time.

Several people complain of the price but not having to deal with going to the store for it and the taxes of it more than makes up for any differences.

review/text: The stress of a tough year is starting to get to me. I've been puckered up so tight for so long, I'm afraid my puckerer may have frozen that way.<br /><br />So I've been searching for inner peace -- and outer unpuckering -- in personal relaxation products. But expensive gadgets and doodads would just angry my blood up further, so I'm seeking Samadhi on a shoestring budget.<br /><br />When my wife goes to a spa to relax, she always gets some kind of oatmeal facial scrub treatment. I don't know much about pampering, but I'm intimately familiar with a wide variety of hot breakfast cereals. If oatmeal on the face is relaxing, then I'd sure give it a try.<br /><br />I heated several packets of the oatmeal in the microwave, per the cooking instructions, added a little milk and layered it onto my face. I'm not sure what's supposed to happen next in a 'professional' treatment, but in my bathroom, a lot of it just glooped off into the sink. The rest felt... well, like oatmeal on my face. Sticky. Warm. Lumpy, in a way that was less 'relaxing' and more 'get it off my face-y'.<br /><br />The oatmeal did smell nice, and made me sort of hungry, but I don't think I relieved any stress by putting it on my face instead of IN my face. Maybe next time I'll try wearing it with eggs over easy, or a rasher of bacon. Bacon makes *everything* peaceful.

review/summary: Add body at little calorie cost
review/text: I see this ingredient on product labels everywhere so I thought I'd check it out. I always liked thick shakes growing up so I thought it might be a way to make a sensible shake or smoothie with the body of a more indulgent drink. Guess what  -  it's amazing! It does the job to the nth degree. With the addition of about half a teaspoon you can make a fat free shake that almost refuses to pour out of the blender. I wouldn't reccommend any more than half a teaspoon to start because you can always add more liquid. I did that and wound up with a full blender full of drink and it was still almost too thick to pour. It's also very popular in salad dressings because it adds body and cling. Home made ice cream is another natural. Try it and discover your own uses.

review/summary: Very pleased
review/text: I bought this because I was looking for a lower cost alternative to the $12 small bags of Red Mill Xantham gum I had been using to make gluten free bread. I was trying to lower the total cost per loaf, otherwise I might as well buy the loaves in the frozed section which are pretty good. I had already figured out a means to cheaply combine my own flour ingredients so I wouldn't need to purchase the expensive Red Mill gluten free flour. Next, I located on Amazon a great bulk deal on bakers yeast that also added to cost reduction (and was superior in result too.) After buying this Xanthan gum, I further reduced the price per loaf significantly. I have found this product works well and have not noticed any difference in quality of my results with my bread. So, I am very happy to have found this alternative at a more reasonable price. I also like the zip lock bag it comes in which is much more handy for baking and easy handling than the Red Mill bag.

review/text: I was a bit apprehensive about straying from the familiar Bob's Red Mill brand of gums, but I'm perfectly happy with this product. There's no discernible difference between this and the much-more-expensive BRM brand, so if you know you'll be using xanthan gum often, this is what you'll want to buy. I use some every day and have barely made a dent in my supply!

The re-sealable bag keeps the product good for quite a while (possibly years if you refridgerate it) and I found no observable difference between this brand and other more expensive ones. A little xanthan gum goes a long way and this 1LB bag should last you quite a while.

review/summary: Wells Earthborn Holsitic Puppy Food
review/text: I purchased a chi poo last week and this is what they had him on. The first bag 6 6lb was $9.99<br />I purchased another bag while he was being groomed 4 days later this store is 13 miles away so I figured it would be a good idea to grab another bag. Granted nothing in this store is priced for the consumer.Imagine my surprise when I checked my receipt to find I was charged $17.99 plus TAX for the same item i purchased 4 days prior at the same pet store for almost $8.00 LESS. There are only three places I can purchase this. At the pet store or online and the costs are outrageous to say the least. I have found other brands of holistic food at Pet Smart about the same Price. You're paying for the name. Same with IAMS and all the rest. Just how much better is this stuff ? I'm not sure. I know this dog evacuates a lot within minutes after eating it !<br /><br />I shop on Amazon all the time and I was stunned to see this listed at $89.00 for 6 lbs bag marked down to $13 but then they soak ya for shipping which is bringing the total up to $20 for a 6 lb bag. I've seen 25 lb bags for that price. Glad I checked. Think it's time for a food change for this pup !

Amazon currently sells it for about $3.95 a box, if you opt for subscribe & save. It's crunchy and takes longer to sog, which is what I like. I don't like Nature's Path Flax Plus Multibran Cereal or Heritage Flakes (not sure which one I tried). It gets soggy too quickly.<br /><br />And if you're curious about the expiration date, all 6 boxes (arrived 2 days ago) are dated for December 2012.

One thing to note on these boxes,the serving size is small and there are not very many servings per. I suggest buying the bags if you like to eat ,"A real bowl" not a cup of cereal. It's far more cost effective. I'd give this cereal five stars if all the ingredients came from North America. The cane juice and rice bran flour are from South America.

review/text: This used to be my favorite cereal. It had fiber, good taste and texture but in the past year or two they started making it sweeter and sweeter. I don't like sweetened cereal. At least with an unsweetened cereal I can choose to make it sweeter myself. But if it is too sweet out of the box there is no choice to make it less sweet. I contacted the company and told them I didn't like how sweet they had made it now. They denied that they had changed anything. They lost me as a customer after that. I was buying 6 boxes a month for almost 2 years straight. I stopped. I waited a few months and decided to try again to see if they had changed their recipe back the way it used to be. I just opened a new box and it is still sickening sweet for my tastes. Goodbye Nature's Path. If I wanted super sweetened sugar cereal that is what I would have bought! Anybody want free 6 boxes? You can have it!!! Yuck!

review/summary: A True Soft Drink
review/text: Do you like ginger? Are you aware of it's health-giving qualities?  Ginger has been shown to settle the digestion, to act as an anti-inflammatory, and may even shrink tumors and inhibit cancer cells. I've seen this specific product recommended in various articles on Naturopathic health. It TASTES healthy. It tastes great, too.<br /><br />Ginger Beer (as opposed to Ginger Ale) is loaded with ginger. And it's rarely more loaded with ginger than here in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW---At 26 grams per bottle, you can practically SEE the ginger in it. It has a lot of ginger "bite."<br /><br />Unlike the soft drink megacorporations which produce a tasteless and overly fizzy sugar water they label as "Ginger Ale", Reed's microbrews it's soft drinks in a process similar to that used by a beer microbrewery. There is no alcohol in REED'S EXTRA GINGER BREW. 25% of REED's EXTRA is fruit juice, part of which contributes to the sugar content, which is comparable to other sodas. REED'S should be a treat, not a substitute for water.<br /><br />REED'S GINGER BREW comes in three varieties, ORIGINAL, PREMIUM, and EXTRA. The amount of ginger increases with each variety (It's a little odd that PREMIUM has less ginger than EXTRA). The labels are similar so check carefully to decide which variety you want.

Well, looked it over and decided I just had to try it. Oh, my! It was good! Really good! It was so superior to the "ginger ales" I've had that there was just no comparison. And this drink tasted like real ginger and it  was good and strong! Boy, this is a fine soft drink. A bottle has just about the same calories as regular soda and I note 37 grams of sugar.

I have tried some of those other brands people are mentioning and they really don't taste any better.
