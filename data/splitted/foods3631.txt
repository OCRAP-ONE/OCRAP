review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.

review/summary: I order more of this than any other coffee. Ordering more today!
review/text: I love Tully's House Blend K-Cups! I have several dozen other flavors and always find myself reaching for Tully's House Blend. It is just right when I wake up in the morning and throughout the day. Strong, bold, but not strong enough to make me so hyper that people run from me! I'm about to order more right now and thought I would stop and make a review while I'm thinking about it.

review/summary: Excellent coffee
review/text: Tully's house blend coffee is a bold coffee that isn't bitter but delivers good coffee flavor.  I use the K-cups for that perfect cup of coffee every time.  I was looking for a replacement for the Kona blend coffee since it has become very difficult to find and the prices have sky rocketed to ridiculousness when you do find it.  This house blend has been a good replacement.

review/text: I was looking for a different type of taste from a coffee, something a little stronger, but it had to go down smooth. This coffee surely filled the bill. I was drinking another brand and it was leaving a nasty taste in my mouth and just didn't seem to go down as smoothly as Tully's. I really recommend you try it if you are looking for a strong but smooth coffee!

review/summary: Taste great, but jam up coffee maker
review/text: As many others have stated, the taste of this coffee is fantastic.  Flavor wise, it is by far my favorite.<br /><br />My concern is that these K-cups keep jamming up my coffee maker.  Every time I make this brand of coffee, I have to use a paper clip the next morning to un-jam the Keurig.  I've noticed that these K-cups have a unique behavior about them.  After making a cup of coffee, I go to eject the empty cup.  The empty cup has a large amount of coffee grains on the top of it.  I have never seen this before in my 4 years of using a Keurig.  I am guessing this behavior is directly affecting the coffee maker by jamming it up.

review/text: Like some of you said, I only got 48 also.  Why do they advertise 50 and then send 48?  It seems minimal to us but 2 times the number of orders adds up for them really fast.  I don't like feeling cheated probably won't order again.  The coffee was strong.  I would compare it to Starbucks.  The order information says they have three different strengths and I didn't see where you can choose the strength so they shipped me Extra Bold.  I usually drink coffee black but with this, I make a 10 oz and 4 oz with one k-cup and then add some cream so I guess that knocks down the per cup price.  Still with feeling cheated, I will look for something better.

One of the reasons I chose this gift was the cute coffee-themed gift box the items come in.  The product description states it "will look fantastic in any coffee lovers home or in the workplace break room, it can be used long after the goodies are gone", so I was expecting the box to be something nice.  However, it was nothing more than cheap cardboard, and my gift recipient said it was bent.  A bent cardboard box is not going to look fantastic anywhere.  I felt the product description was a bit misleading in this regard.

review/text: I have always loved cheese puffs but finding the perfect one was difficult.<br /><br />Cheeto's "Dangerously Cheesy" Cheese Puffs were disgusting. I do not think their "cheese" is even real cheese. I wanted something plainer and healthier for myself.<br /><br />I have tired smaller companies but they always ended getting bankrupt or discontinuing their plaining cheese puffs.<br /><br />Finally, I tried Smart Puffs from my local supermarket. I was a little skeptical; they were so cheap! When I got home and popped one in my mouth, I was so surprised each puff was lightly covered in cheese. Each puff was not completely crunchy; they sort of slowly melt in your mouth as you chew!<br /><br />I will definitely recommend anyone who looking for a healthy snack alternative this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />A healthy snack<br />Lightly covered in cheese<br />Delicious, too!<br /><br />Cons:<br />It is so hard to put down a bag!

review/summary: A Mouthful of air
review/text: This is a snack that I can't find in our local markets.  I ordered a case of puffs from amazon.com on a whim.  Shoping for food online was a first for me. When this huge box arrived my wife and I couldn't believe the size of it.  We had a good laugh unpacking 24 bags of Smart Puffs and ate one bag full right away.  The puffs tasted quite good and with the reasonably healthful ingredients they contain we did not feel guilty eating them.<br /><br />The puffs have a pleasant natural cheese taste.  However, eating Gourmet Smart Puffs is a somewhat startling experience. Pop a couple of the puffs into your mouth chew a few times and it feels like a crunchy mouthful of cheesy air.  Is that strange or what?<br /><br />I think I would like a bit more substance to my snacks, but I guess one can't have it all and still remain reasonably healthy.  Smart puffs do not seem like junk food.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, your fingers do not get all yellow eating Smart Puffs.  I have ordered my second case of Robert's Smart Puffs.

review/summary: Like Cheese Jax not Cheetos
review/text: I was expecting the Cheetos like snacks that are in the Chaos mix (which is quite yummy), but that's not what these are.  They are thick and airy like Jax, not hard a crunchy like Cheetos.  They taste good, but if you're looking for crunchy, this isn't it.<br /><br />Does anyone know if they sell the Cheetos like stuff that's in Chaos by itself?

review/summary: Tastes good but DEVIOUS Nutritional Information
review/text: Yes, I do like the taste of these cheese puffs.  Enough said about taste.  Here's the issue -->  Get a bag, look at the nutritional information and ask yourself "How many calories are in a bag of these puffs?"  Your initial answer will likely be 140 calories as that is what is printed on the bag of "about 1" servings.  In actuality, the bag is 1 3/8 oz or 1.375 oz.  So, there is over 190 calories in a bag which is more that 1/3 more calories than what you observe via a fast look at the nutritional info on the bag.  I consider this devious at the very least.  Now, is that not so SMART or what??

review/text: I've bought everything Pirate Brands has made (except for Potato Flyers) and this one is probably the best overall. My wife and I can't stop eating these. They're simply awesome. Very cheesy, good texture, very easy to chew, no greasy/oily aftertaste or residue on your hands, just precious cheese dust! We like mixing these up with other cheese snacks (pirate booty, gold fish crackers, etc) and pretzels for a nice custom snack mix. These are sure to please anyone that likes cheese curls, just don't tell whoever you give them to that they are more healthy than normal cheese puffs and they'll never know the difference!

review/summary: Pretty good for a 'healthy' snack, but not great
review/text: The best thing about these is the smell when you first open the bag - pure white cheddar goodness.  Too bad they don't taste like that.  The first few are good, but when I ate more than 5 or 6 'puffs', I got an acidic taste in my mouth.  At that point, most of the cheddar flavor went away.  If you're ok with eating one small handful of these, by all means, buy away - you'll be pleased.  Otherwise, they're just ok, not great.  At least they're not as bad for you as other snacks of this type.

review/text: while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.

review/text: Boy was I dissapointed in these babies.  I thought that they would taste like an actually puff, but they tasted like nothing, honestly. I love pirates booty, that is my favorite and one that I am going to stick to.  These taste like a very very weark version of pirates booty, no flavor to speak of at all and not worth the money.  So I would buy a bag at a store first to try before purchasing online in a large amount.  Dont expect much flavor or anything form this snack, unless your into eating flavorless food.

review/text: For me - these are great - they're light and crunchy without the bright orage residue of others.  My baby loves these (she's not been spoiled by others kinds) and my older boys don't care for them.  they prefer other kinds of chips.  I think if you start them very young or try them later once the kids are old enough to grasp the idea of nutrition - they'll be a big hit.  I personally prefer the taste of these over other brands and other types of salty, crunchy snacks.

Unfortunately, she had changed her mind by the time the gigantic box  arrived on the doorstep.  My huband and I tried them, and I feel like giving a stern punishment to the maker of these things.  Besides having no discernable nutritional content, these things have too much salt, too much fake "cheez" powder, and no way to remove it gracefully after you'e eaten a few puffs. We don't like them, and I feel terrible dumping them on the food pantry. Perhaps I'll hide them in a large donation of healthier items.

review/summary: Japanese-style cooking must-have
review/text: Miso is a base for many Japanese-style soups and other food treatments, no western substitutions are possible. This is my first experience with miso and a positive one. It is salty and assertive, but it IS a fermented concentrate after all. Buying the 2lb. size is the only practical way to stock this item at home, IF one is serious about learning its uses. It stores beautifully in the fridge after opening. The flavors are a welcome change from the usual euro-inspired fare and is far superior to the "plastic" asian food to which we westerners are subjected.<br />Storage is no problem. Clip one corner of the package and squeeze the miso out like toothpaste to measure. Then, squish the paste back to the package bottom, squeeze air out, roll/fold the clipped end under and fasten with a clothes clip, big paper clip, etc. Stores for many months in the refrigerator.

review/summary: Great soup additive
review/text: I had heard of miso for years, but was reluctant to use it as I avoid most soybean products. I make a lot of my own broth and a spoonful of this miso paste adds so much flavor.  I only purchase non-GMO and non-MSG foods, and that was the deciding factor in this purchase.

review/summary: Thrilled To Find These on Amazon
review/text: I discovered these crackers by accident when we lived in Rhode Island, and I immediately fell in love with the JJ Flats Sesame crackers. Only (1) specialty store in my area carried these crackers (none of the major grocery chains).<br /><br />These delicious crackers are super crunchy and so tasty. They are awesome with peanut butter and other spreads, and one of my favorite breakfast items (with peanut butter especially) along with a cup of great coffee.<br /><br />We moved to another state a few months ago and sadly none of the stores sold this item. I can't imagine why. I was thrilled to find them on AMAZON, and the price was great too. Buying a carton (12 boxes) was not a problem either as they go quickly in our house . EVERYONE LOVES THESE CRACKERS here! Try them and see for yourself.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

review/text: This wonderful French vanilla blend is better than regular vanilla extract, which is bitter until you bake it. French vanilla blend imparts a light vanilla flavor to foods that aren't cooked, like yogurt and soy milk. Lately I haven't been able to find it in stores, so I buy in bulk from Amazon.com. Thanks for helping me "stock up"!

review/summary: Not in stock
review/text: The tea itself is very good. I tried to purchase this item as a gift for my father. Unfortunately, amazon's "in stock" in this case meant way out of stock. They finally bothered to tell me a month after the original order, and now the Customer service rep tells me that they have no plans to get it in stock for me. And yet, I notice the site still says "in stock"!!!<br /><br />Buyer beware: Just because amazon says it's in stock and ready to ship does NOT mean it is now (nor ever will be) in stock. If it's a food item, like this one, you're much better off to make a special request at your local grocer.

review/text: I purchased this product after receiving a gift basket for Christmas, which had the Cherry Vanilla Flavor.  I loved it, so I went online to purchase a case, now I see they sell them in my local Rite-Aid, which I will continue to purchase them online, since it is cheaper through Amazon.com.  I love every flavor, such a nice treat when I need something good, I have lost 20lbs since I started eating healthy and Nutorious Nut Mix is my perfect snack when I am needing something sweet and full of flavor.

review/summary: Pretty Darn Good Stuff
review/text: This is pretty much the only kind of Kraft Macaroni and Cheese I eat. I loved them all as a kid, but not so much anymore. The Three Cheese has a good taste. Every now and then you'll get a pack that tastes "off," but I suppose that's what happens when you have a mix of cheeses? Anyway, this is what I eat when I can't think of anything else I'd rather eat.<br /><br />Oh, and I doctor mine a bit. Try adding some garlic powder, salt, and pepper into the water. Most of the spice boils out and gets dumped with the water, but it makes a big difference, taste-wise.

review/text: I am a pretty picky mac and cheese consumer.  I also have very picky children.  We love the flavor that the three cheese offers, plus the shells tend to be a little thicker and they don't over cook as easily as the regular macaroni shape.<br />My favorite thing about ordering this from Amazon is that the price is amazing.  I also love that I don't waste money by going to the store and buying other things I don't need.  I love that it ships straight to my door.

review/summary: (Cheese) Diamond in the Rough
review/text: Ordered on May 23 with super saver shipping and received it on June 22.  Was it worth the 30+ day wait?  Of course!<br /><br />$32.66 for 24 boxes = $1.36/box<br /><br />The price is great, especially for online since you CANNOT find this in stores anymore.  I live in a huge city and cannot find this in Target or any supermarkets.  The Kraft product locator on the Kraft website was incorrect about it being stocked in stores in my area.  AMAZON to the rescue, as usual.  It seems this delicacy is nearly extinct which is sad because it's the only Kraft macaroni worthy of your taste-buds.<br /><br />All the other Kraft mac & cheese makes me think of being an indiscriminate kid that will eat any funny tube-style pasta with bright orange manufactured cheese; perhaps kids 'are' the target market.  Yes, THREE CHEESE is Kraft macaroni in a box, but it's amazing.  The cheese just tastes good, not heavy or fake, and the shells are perfect size.  Add some oregano, red pepper, or even sausage and you've got yourself a tasty yet inexpensive meal.<br /><br />Milk and butter sold separately.

review/summary: For true cocoa lovers only
review/text: Quick chocolate chemistry lesson:<br /><br />1.  If you use "natural cocoa" it is acidic, and designed to be used in baking with baking soda as a leavener.  It is not intended to be used as a drink mix for hot cocoa.<br /><br />2.  Many recent "gourmet" cocoa products tout "natural cocoa" because it is cheaper than alkali processing.  However the high price will probably give you an acid stomach ache.  It does that to me.  Ouch.<br /><br />3.  "Dutch cocoa" is processed by simply exposing cocoa to baking soda, nothing more creepy than that. It just neutralizes the acids so you can stomach it, and to tone down the harsh flavor.  Your taste buds may prefer "natural cocoa" because you're used to it, but not everyone does.  I think it's too harsh.  Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />4.  Alkali processed cocoa is also easier to mix with liquids so you don't get a gloppy, lumpy mess like you do with natural cocoa.  It's a lot like the difference between masa flour and corn meal flour.  One has been processed with alkali, one not.  The traditional version, masa, has been processed with alkali (traditionally potash).<br /><br />Therefore, if you need to make brownies with a recipe using only baking soda leavener, use natural cocoa.  If you're making hot chocolate, use your own discretion based on the flavor you like, but if you get a stomach ache from natural cocoa, then use dutch cocoa.  Dutch cocoa is probably what you remember from childhood hot chocolate anyway, so if you like Swiss Miss or Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, then stick with dutch cocoa, or the flavor will be "off" for you. The reason cocoa tastes "off" is because you're used to "natural" and bought "dutch" or vice versa.<br /><br />Re the comments about sellers...  I've been a customer here for years and I still don't trust anyone who doesn't at least fulfill through amazon.  Their rating had better be above 96% too.<br /><br />Products that have dutch processed cocoa (in order of my preference):<br /><br />1.  Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa<br />2.  Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa<br />3.  This product<br /><br />There are probably more but I haven't tried them.<br /><br />Products I know are way too acidic for me and are natural cocoa (in order of nastiness / acidity):<br /><br />1.  Trader Joe's Sipping Chocolate<br />2.  Ghirardelli Unsweetened Cocoa<br />3.  Hershey's Cocoa "Great for Baking" (NOT the Special Dark)<br /><br />Best wishes for finding what you're looking for!  This one is for hot chocolate lovers only.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate, But Prime shipping Vanished?
review/text: PROS<br />I just LOVED these chocolates and received them February 2012 with free 2 day prime shipping. They were being sold for $19.20 and the shipping was free.  I need the health benefits of the 88% dark chocolate and these were very tasty indeed. YUM!<br /><br />CONS<br />When I went to order more in May 2012 (3 months later)  the price had changed to $19.79 and the shipping instead of being Prime 2 day free was now $5.27, so that makes the overall cost almost 31% more, just 3 months later.<br /><br />For a serious dark chocolate lover like me, this was so very sad.<br /><br />I  dislike the 31% increase in overall price in under 3 months.<br /><br />It makes me so sad. I wish I had some dark chocolate.

review/text: I was recently told by the doctor to start eating dark chocolate, and drinking red wine on a daily basis. After trying some other brands, this has become my absolute favorite! It's a little on the raw side, taste wise, but that is actually what makes this particular brand so appealing to me. The potency of the flavor really bites you, especially when enjoyed with a glass of dry red wine.<br /><br />My only complaint: When I purchased this item from Amazon on March 31st, the price was $18.96. I'm not sure why the price has increased about 100%, but this product is available elsewhere on the internet for about the same price I paid the first time around.

review/text: Right after I ordered this I went to Costco and saw that they had a 60 squares package of Ghirardelli 86% dark chocolate for $10. I bought it and planned to return this chocolate instead. Though, I then found out that this item is non-returnable. I am glad though - it is SO much better! It is very smooth and satisfying. I was intimidated at first by 88% chocolate... I thought it would be bitter and gross, but it is wonderful! I've been sharing pieces with my classmates and they all love it too. It makes me feel better in those times when I am dreading going to class. It is nice that they come in 10 count packages - they look pretty nice and would make a nice small gift. I highly recommend this product.
