review/summary: Flavorful, Creamy & Smooth Split Pea Soup
review/text: If you struggled for years using store bought green split peas and have never been satisfied with your soup, struggle no more.  For years I tried different recipes and was never satisfied with the end result because of the inferior product I was using.  My green split pea soup has never been better now that I started using this company's product.  Palouse Brand's product is hardy, tender, flavorful, creamy and smooth when cooked.  There is no dissapointment here. This farming family knows how to delivery fresh!

review/summary: Comfort food at it's best
review/text: I love split pea soup and these peas are so fresh and cook up so well.  Can you buy cheaper split peas?  Of course you can but they likely weren't grown in the US and are probably a couple of years old.  These peas are far superior to the bag of peas in the grocery store.  These are grown in Washington, packaged in Washington and shipped from Washington.  It is worth it to spend a little more for a far superior product!

review/summary: As far as I can tell, these are very good split peas
review/text: I have made homemade split pea soup for many years.  I recently resumed doing so after not for about a decade.  I bought organic split peas at my local market, they were tasteless.  Chicken broth was used to make that soup, too.  But these split peas were much more flavorful.  They cooked up much better as well, meaning that the first brand's peas must have been old, bcs after an hour or more they were still tough.  So, that tells me these are fresh, and superior.

review/summary: Delicious and heart warming.
review/text: These are delicious peas. I made about 6 crock pots of pea soup before the bag was finished. I hardly had to add any spices for it to taste delicious. Just some natural sea salt and a little brags amino acids. Plus I put in a few garlic cloves and it was so heart warming soup. Usually, with ordinary peas, you have to put bacon and other spices in to make it good. Not with these peas. They were delicious on their own. Also delivered timely. Thanks again.

review/summary: Top Quality Dried Peas
review/text: I love making pea soups - all kinds.  I received these peas a couple of days ago from Amazon and made my first batch of curry pea soup today.  These peas are some of the cleanest and of the highest quality I've ever purchased.  I always rinse and sort me legumes before I cook them and usually find something to sort out.  Not with these.  They where all beautiful and well formed with no trace of dirt, stems or any other debris.  I'm very impressed.  Oh, and they taste wonderful.  I highly recommend you purchase them - in fact, purchase two so you qualify for Amazon's free shipping!

review/summary: The Best of the Best
review/text: It would be very hard to purchase any other brand of split peas after having had the pleasure of tasting these. Each pea is perfect; no imperfect ones to toss out. The final result is mouthwatering. I made a big pot, threw in some vegetables, and can barely keep myself away from having too much now and not enough left for another day.<br /><br />And, being organic and GMO free, wrapped very carefully in gunny sack material inside a plastic bag, it is a healthful contributory to the diner, not a questionable one.<br /><br />I'm really glad I discovered these split peas. I can't imagine anything better.

review/text: These are the best-tasting green splits I've ever had.  I love creamy soups, split pea being one of my favorites, but it's not usually easy to make a delicious creamy soup without adding some sort of meat flavoring (I don't eat anything that used to have a face). These peas are delicious without having been cooked with any sort of meat/chicken-based flavorings.  Nice and fresh-no more of those gray colored little things sold in plastic bags at the grocery store. These peas even smell fresh in the bag (which is a nice drawstring muslin).

review/summary: Great product - no so truthful vendor
review/text: First and foremost, this is an excellent yeast product. It works incredibly well.<br /><br />The company assured me by phone contact the yeast would be recently manufactured. My expectation was that it would be within the past 3 to 6 months. It was not. The serial manufacture code implied a product made in late 2010. That's about 10 months old.<br /><br />Granted the yeast is still very usable and will last about another year before expiration with proper storage. It's just a disappointment for the price paid. It's a premium product.

review/summary: Waste of time, money and food
review/text: Is there any actual yeast in this? I have used this many times from several different batches and purchased from different retailers at different times. It often comes prepacked as the yeast in pre-packaged bread mixes.  Each time I was careful to make sure that it was nowhere near the expiration date. In EVERY case, the bread has failed to rise. This is worse than garbage as it ruins all the ingredients and you have to throw it all out; there is little worse than needlessly wasting food.  When it comes with the pre-packaged mixes, I have tried throwing out this branded "yeast" packet and replaced it with other brands of yeast.  When I do this, the bread comes out perfectly.  The bread is only ruined if I actually used this brand of yeast.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you want to be disappointed and waste time, energy, money and food, then this is exactly what you want.<br /><br />Update May 2012:<br /><br />I have been experimenting with this brand of yeast by trying to activate in the following manner. Take one packet (about two teaspoons), add 1/4 teaspoon of sugar and 1/4 cup of water between 110 and 120 degrees. Put it in a coffee cup and get it all nice and wet and wait about five minutes. Red Star brand and Fleischmans (regular and fast rising) and the Hodgson Mill yeast in their bread machine mixes (the only other ones I have checked) yeast will rise and fill half the coffee mug. (Fast risers fill the whole cup) This brands increases its volume by just a little.<br /><br />I have also found that Red Star (regular, did not try the fast rise) yeast that is more than one year past its expiration date performs nearly as well as the fresh stuff. Therefore I can say with the confidence of empirical evidence that Red Star yeast that is more than one year past the expiration on the package performs better (read: acceptable) than the packets of unexpired SAF yeast I have tried (read: unacceptable).

review/summary: Great sauce for a jar
review/text: This is the best Tikka Masala sauce I've ever had from a jar.  The flavor easily cooks into the vegetables we added, and is definitely better than others we tasted (Pataks - bland, tasty bite - needs more taste, Sharwood - slightly less bland than the Pataks).  Unfortunately, it's no longer available at my local grocer - we only find the Pataks in the discount isle and, well, the only good Pataks is the Vindaloo flavor which is still lacking).  This sauce has a slightly tart flavor which mixes very well with rice and vegetables and/or meat/tofu.  There is a bit of extra oil that never spoils the taste.  After eating this, it's hard to eat another Tikka Marsala dish without going to an authentic Indian place.

review/text: I purchased this product just a few days ago. Swift product delivery and the packaging was so carefully done. The chocolate was packed in paper inside a plastic bag, then a cold pack around that inside cold preserving bubble wrap, all surrounded by packing peanuts in a small box. So very well packed that there was no way that the chocolate would get bruised or cracked. The product was perfect and smelled amazing as I opened the protective packaging.<br />This is a really delightful sampler of delicious organic chocolate. It is just cacao beans, cane sugar and what ever seasoning makes up the flavor enhancement (cinnamon, vanilla, guajillo chili, salt & pepper, orange, chipotle chili, ginger, and cacao puro). It can be enjoyed as is or you can make a hot chocolate drink with it. "Good to Eat or Drink". So very good and of course it is healthy :). Our favorite so far is the guajillo chili. Yummy chocolate with a kick.

review/text: I love the item but one egg cup was cracked when I opened the box.  It was packed well so I'm sure it's a fluke. I would still use this seller again.  I just wanted a replacement though.  However, when I went to the return area, replacement was not an option.  I hope the seller will replace this for me.  I don't want to go to the trouble and expense of sending it back.  The egg set is adorable and I'm excited to use three of them.  I obviously wish I could use all four since that is what I have paid for.  Accidents happen and I know this isn't the sellers fault.  The egg set and spoons are exactly what I wanted and are very adorable.  Love them.

review/summary: Very nice set - not as fragile as one might expect
review/text: As a child, I regularly had soft boiled eggs in egg holders similar, though not identical to these. I probably went over 40 years without having a soft boiled egg. Recently I warched the movie "Iron Lady" where Meryll Streep portrays Margaret Thatcher. In the opening scene of that film Thatcher serves soft boiled eggs in holders similar to these and it planted the seed in me to start eating soft boiled eggs again.<br /><br />Yes, these are porcelain, but knowing that, they're not unusually fragile - they're  as fragile, indeed I believe LESS so, than a reasonable person would expect from porcelain. I think less so because they're actually pretty heavy. I don't envision the spoons breaking unless they're dropped. If used solely to crack eggs they're  just fine.<br /><br />It's a nice set and One I think represents good value when compared to others available at this Website at the time of this writing. My set came with five spoons. I don't know if that was an error on the part of the ackaging company or if they've decided to add an extra just in case.

review/text: Planters has released an impressive product - these snacks are quite delectable and full of protein!<br /><br />However, buyer beware: Those with peanut allergies should avoid this product. This snack is dangerous for those individuals! While there is some mention on the label that the product contains peanuts, I think that there really should be a more prominent warning about this! Maybe Planters thinks its customers will realize that this product is not intended for those with peanut allergies, but as a company you can never be too careful about keeping your customers safe!<br /><br />I enjoyed this product, and it earns four out of five stars easily, but I can not recommend it for everybody. Those with peanut allergies should stay clear!

review/summary: Good Tuna, Dented And 'Blown' Cans
review/text: This is very good tuna. It is a 'signature' product from a 'big box' store. The price is steep, but the convenience of ordering by mail and thus avoiding the in-store herd - hot, sweaty, lumbering, unwashed, path-blocking, and feeding absent-mindedly on freebie food samples - would be, under normal circumstances, worth the price.<br /><br />However, the cans arrived with the shrink wrap cut open as if undented cans had been removed and replaced with dented cans.  Every can had some kind of dent, some more serious than others, and two cans were 'blown' meaning the tops of the cans moved up and down easily when pressed. Unsafe, the 'blown' cans went straight-away into the garbage.<br /><br />Do to the above, in the future, if I want this brand of tuna again, I'll have to brave the hoards and get it in-store so I can inspect the cans before purchase.

review/summary: Coffee without the caffeine!
review/text: Coffee-like drink without the caffeine - wonderful!<br /><br />For years I have tried to cut back on coffee by avoiding it (not a good idea) switching to tea (ok but still does not work for me), or substituting other things (usually too rich and fattening). But now, I have experienced Teeccino, and I love it.<br /><br />All coffee drinkers will know what I mean when I say there is a different feeling and mental/psychological experience between drinking a cup of rich, dark coffee and a cup of wonderful tea. Both are great, but if you really want coffee, the tea just does not have the same look or texture/feel in the mouth like coffee has.<br /><br />So Teeccino is a great substitute for coffee because it meets these qualities I look for. It is dark, sometimes black, in the cup. It is rich smelling, and has the body or texture in the mouth like a coffee product. Just like coffee and tea, you can drink it plain or add cream and sugar.<br /><br />This particular blend with the chocolate is wonderful. I, personally, do not add any sugar at all, but I do use a little creamer sometimes.<br /><br />I like a cup of Teecinno in the late afternoon and evening because it is herbal and has absolutely NO caffeine. I can have my coffee-like drink without the worry of being up all night long. We all know that even de-caffinated drinks still have caffeine and therefore can still cause problems for some people, but this never had caffeine so there are no problems.<br /><br />Finally, I tried other brands of a similar product, but I promise you, Teeccino is the best of all of them, and it has multiple flavors to match the specialty coffees on the market.

review/summary: Wouldn't want to be without it
review/text: I'm a lifelong migraine sufferer, and caffeine, which I crave and adore, is one of my many triggers.  I'm a health food nut who slides off the wagon from time to time, but with Teeccino, there's no need to stray.  I've tried all or most of their flavors, and I tend to come back to chocolate organic, but hazelnut is good, too.<br /><br />I have a small coffee pot that brews about 4 cups, and I drink (at my computer where I work at home) from giant Fiestaware cups that hold two cups each.  For brewing a pot, one slightly rounded tablespoon is plenty, and sometimes later in the day I'll pour in more water and brew the same grounds again with little change in taste.  So, it's not as expensive as you might think.<br /><br />I also like to drink it cold in summer with 2 cups Teeccino, a cup of almond milk, and lots of ice.  I may sweeten it with a little powdered Stevia, but it's fine either way. I've been drinking Teeccino for at least 10 years and always buy through Amazon.com because it's lots higher at health food stores and Whole Foods.

I add Coffee Mate and sugar.<br /><br />I really like this particular flavor's blend of chocolate and spices.<br /><br />You've got to at least try this product.

It takes a couple of days to get used to the different taste, but by day 3, I felt I was drinking coffee & didn't ever miss it. It made it a cinch to give up caffeine. I add a little soy milk & agave & yummy, what a way to start my day. Non-acidic, so I feel my reflux is much better, so I couldn't ask for more from this product. I recommend it to anyone wanting a healthy replacement for coffee and/or soda.

I felt that its nonacidic qualities would give me a delicious beverage without the not-so-good side effects of coffee. I started out with their chocolate mint flavor, but it was too minty for me. I did feel that it gave me fresh breath, though!  :-) Then I moved on to their vanilla nut and was happy with it, but it didn't have the pizzazz I was looking for. It is a good flavor, and I still enjoy it, but the Maya chocolate has the richness of a dark roast with dark chocolate and chili pepper edges. It was love at first sip! I use the Amazon Subscribe and Save program--great pricing and no S/H. What could be better--great "coffee," great price, and great service!

They didn't have duck potato lg size without hickory smoke either.<br />  the pet store was told the packaging would change. Picture very deceiving and Hickory Smoke flavor was NOT included in description nor size change.  So Yes I was and am kind of disapointed.  I may buy them again.

review/summary: good sweetener substitute for sugar calories
review/text: Have been using this sweetener in my coffee daily for years and much prefer the taste over other sugar substitutes, even preferring it over sugar in my coffee.  Use one packet per coffee cup (limit of two coffee cups per day). Do not use in baking but occasionally use it on cereal with fruit.  Do not like any artificial sweeteners in my tea, however.  It does not save me that many calories per day, but as said before, I prefer it to sugar in my coffee.

review/summary: It's hard to find tasty sugar free syrups but this one is seasonally DEELISH!
review/text: I'm a new mom and so obviously to get rid of the baby weight going sugar free is a good start.  I'm not going to kid myself... does anything sugar free/healthier for us ever taste exactly as good as the real deal... probably not. This syrup, however, is VERY deelish!  I used to be addicted to a certain chain coffee place's pumpkin spice lattes, but this is a great alternative!  Make a latte with the syrup put a little fat free whip cream on top with sprinkled cinnamon and who need that "other place"?!  I would definitely recommend this syrup to a friend!

review/summary: Pretty good, needs some tweaking
review/text: First off, hats off to Torani's product development team. The sugar-free amazingness of some of their flavors (that's you, Torani SF Hazelnut!) has done a lot for my health. After a coffee/toffee/hazelnut latte, who needs cake?? And I love pumpkin ANYTHING, so I snapped up this flavor as soon as I saw it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe it needs some tweaking. In the bottle, it smells like partially raw sweet potatoes, not really like pumpkin. In the cup, the sweet-to-pumpkin ratio is WAY too high.<br /><br />Also, I know they have a separate pumpkin-spice flavor, but pumpkin pie tastes a lot more of spices than this syrup does. They're not kidding when they say it tastes like pumpkin pie filling ...it tastes like plain filling out of the can!<br /><br />It's true I could buy the other flavor and mix them, but then my drink would either gag me with sweetness, or I wouldn't be able to taste the pumpkin.<br /><br />So let's hope they keep working on this syrup. It's a promising flavor!

review/summary: Need to use a little more than usual but still delicious!
review/text: I love pumpkin drinks but this season I found the versions from Starbucks and Caribou to be too sugary and felt that they had a strong chemical flavor.  When I saw the ad for this syrup I couldn't wait to check it out to add to my coffee at home.  I have a lot of the sugar-free syrups from Torani and usually I need just a tiny splash to get the full affect but with the pumpkin I need to use a little more.  Once I found the right mix of coffee and syrup I was really pleased.  I like it so much that I am going to stock up in case they only carry it seasonally!  It is not really strong but I like it so much better than the store bought drinks.

review/summary: Smells like pumpkin pie but doesn't taste like it...
review/text: I purchased the Torani brand based on my previous experiences with Torani syrups and products but I am not too satisfied with this specific flavor.  Opening up the bottle it definitely smells like what you would get out of a pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc..  The syrup itself is almost like water even when refrigerated and doesn't have a typical syrup consitency.  I tried it both as flavoring to a regular cup of coffee and an espresso drink and was unimpressed.  It definitely had the sweetness that I wanted, but the flavors that I expected weren't there.  I assume maybe buying some pumpkin spice and sprinkling it into the coffee / latte might make it taste better.  I will however try the other brand of syrup that is for sale on Amazon.com and do a taste comparison between the two.  I suggest waiting until another brand comes out with another flavor.  I would even suggest just waiting until Starbucks starts serving up Skinny Pumpkin Spice Lattes.

review/summary: Great for sugar-free lovers, not for the rest
review/text: If you are someone who cannot and will not have their coffee syrups with any sugar, this is one of the better sugar-free syrups on the market. However if you're someone simply given the choice between the sugar-free and regular who thinks, "well, might as well go with the sugar-free. Less calories and I don't need the extra sugar," I would recommend against it. While you're right that there is less calories, the taste is not at all comparable to the regular stuff. I am someone who automatically goes for sugar-free firstly. I picked up a bottle at World Market and the flavor is very plain no matter how much you add in your coffee. To me personally, it tastes mostly of artificial sweetener, which is one of the main ingredients. You might not care all that much. But if you really are looking for tasty, flavorful additions to your coffee, I'd recommend the regular. The taste is worth the splurge!

review/summary: pretty good except for maki
review/text: For some reason, some people don't like nori so you're stuck using these often times.  They may be good for non-sushi related dishes, but if you want to make maki you'll want to try it the normal way instead of inside-out.  Ingredients have difficulty sticking to this mame nori, making it really difficult to roll.  I figured the half sheets would be perfect for inside-out maki, as they're a bit short for regular unless it's a one-ingredient roll.  But the flavor is neutral and should please your nori haters.  Eat the seaweed, people.

review/text: This is a good quality dog food. About a month ago it was $31.79 with free shipping. I purchased two bags. It's about the same price as Purina and Pedigree, but a much higher quality product. It was one of the only meat-based dog foods at under $1/lb that I could find. However, the price has sky rocketed and is now $52 for the same size bag, so I didn't reorder. Instead, I purchased Intimidator dog food by Hi Tek. It was only about $35 for a 50 lb. bag with free shipping and has similar nutritional value to this dog food. I really hope Diamond Hi Energy costs go back to normal because I'd love to switch back, but not at this price.

review/summary: The unfortunate circumstances surrounding a once great Belgian ale...
review/text: During the late 1990's and early 2000's, this was one of my favorites.  Back then, the 750ml bottle was the only option; I would purchase it to share with friends, trying to introduce them to something new in the beer world.  Strangely, the beer then left the Minnesota markets for a couple of years.  Needless to say I was quite displeased with this.  Despite my efforts, there was just no way that I could logistically get my hands on this now precious and coveted ale.  Then just a couple of years ago, Leffe resurfaced again - this time exclusively in 6 pack form.  Moreover, it was now in virtually every liquor store that carried at least a minimal selection of imported beers.  Although I was pleased that Leffe had returned, it just didn't feel quite right; it was now too ubiquitous, and I missed the old 750 ml corked bottles.  Now, in the past year or so, the 750ml bottles have returned.  Additionally, the sticker price is surprisingly much cheaper (approximately $4 - $6) than its Belgian competitors.  Once again, I was glad to see the return of the quintessentially Belgian corked bottle for Leffe.  However, the significantly reduced cost of the ale made me a bit suspicious.  Regardless, like reacquainting with an old friend, I decided to pick up a bottle to see if Leffe was still one of Belgium's finest.  While there is no doubt that Leffe is still a quality Belgian ale, there seems to be something slightly different with this product, some subtilities that seem to be lacking.  I noticed it mainly in the finish of the beer; there seemed to be a vaguely noticeable "thinness" that I've sometimes associated with cheaper quality American brews.  I started to "smell a rat," so I decided to dig a little bit deeper into recent information about Leffe; what I uncovered made my heart sink a little bit...<br />It seems that one major step in the wrong direction for Leffe occurred in 2004.  It was during this time that Interbrew, the company that owned the rights to Leffe, merged with the Brazilian brewing company AmBev.  Changing the company name to InBev following the merger, the conglomerate earned itself a very negative reputation as a ruthless predator in the beer manufacturing world. It is also noteworthy to point out that this was roughly the same time period in which Leffe became conspicuously absent from the shelves of Minneapolis liquor stores.  Coincidence?  Maybe, but I'm willing to bet that it wasn't.  In November 2008, InBev purchased Budweiser giant Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion. Changing the name to "Anheuser-Busch InBev" (or "AB InBev" for short), the newly formed conglomerate was now the world's #1 beer manufacturer.  Moreover, multiple resources that I read cited the fact that AB InBev was now using corn and other cost-effective measures in their brewing process for Leffe -- something that was not being done previously.  In one fell swoop, this explains the recent widespread distribution, the suspiciously low cost, and the noticeably different taste of a once great Belgian ale.  As I write this, I keep shaking my head; I feel a bit duped and betrayed (unfortunately, Leffe is just the tip of the iceberg - other quality beers such as Franziskaner, Bass,  Goose Island, and Hoegaarden are also owned by AB InBev).<br /><br />By most accounts that I've read, AB InBev seems to have garnered a reputation for buying up smaller beer companies and either callously altering their brewing processes (in the name of cost-effective measures) or working toward closing the products lines down altogether.  There's lots of negative information out there in regard to this company... I may need to reconsider how often ( if at all) I should purchase products that support such a dubious organization.

I used to feed my dogs Science Diet Sensitive Stomach (2 of 4 doctors at our hospital feed SD to their own dogs) but when employees were no longer given massive discounts on SD, I switched to this dog food since its about the same price as regular SD. science diet always seemed to make my beagle's poop mushy, although my other big dog does well with science diet and has firm poop. One of the other vets (who is more holistic) suggested this food to me since the ingredients are more natural and not from corn or meat by-products found in Science diet, and she preferred it over Science Diet ingredient and quality-wise. My beagle's poop is no longer mushy, and both my dogs are on this diet now and they seem to love it.<br /><br />**Keep in mind, every veterinarian is different and each vet has their own opinions about which food is best for dogs.<br />Consult with your veterinarian for diet advice.

review/text: Great dry dog food for the price. My dog eats enjoys it, and the ingredients are healthy. It is fortified with vitamins and is definitely a great deal for $32 for 40lb bag!

review/summary: Breeder Review:  Been Feeding this since it first came out to my German Shepherds!
review/text: Seriously, the first  FIVE ingredients make up 75% of ANY dog food, so all remaining ingredients is a gimmick to my opinion. Diamond doesn't advertise so they keep their prices reasonable.  I called Diamond years ago, the makers of many dog foods, incl. its very over rated Taste of the Wild.  Spoke with the nutritionist and ask the questions i needed answered.<br /><br />What of the Calcium phosphorous levels?  are they 1:1 ?  YES.  Good that's what we want.<br /><br />As a breeder of large breed dogs, its costly to feed a large dog, i did a lot of searching to do my dogs justice and to watch for SLOW growth, so NEVER feed a large breed a puppy food either.<br />(PS: I feed the regular beef or chicken, not the lamb, and not the large breed, its useless as its not enough of the recommended amounts of glucosamine/msn in it per cup fed)
