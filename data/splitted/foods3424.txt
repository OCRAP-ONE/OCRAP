review/text: Now I'm a bog fan of wild bill's jerky, but never had the black pepper flavor or eaten jerky slabs before.<br />Well now that I have I can certainly say that both attributes are quite good, and work well together.<br />The only downside would be that wild bill's is just so expensive, but so worth it, and that is a problem when you are a poor college student.

review/summary: Delicious Sheet Meat!!!
review/text: SHEETMEAT, baby... that's what I like to call it... Flat sheets of delicious meat is what Buffalo Bill's Teriyaki Western Cut Big Slab Beef Jerky is all about!<br /><br />I pretty much agree with Blake's take on this product... really thin, yet nice and chewy Sheet meat.  Excellent teriyaki flavor and as mentioned, perfect for cutting into little bite-sized bits...<br /><br />I like a little dish of this right by the computer at work.  When I have a bad moment, I just hit a little bit of jerky and everything is better, on the spot!<br /><br />Buffalo Bill's Teriyaki slab jerky.... Nothing better!!!!!!  Get some!

review/summary: A good change
review/text: This seller has sold nothing but great meat products in a timely manner and I'd buy from them again in a heart beat.  This product really stands out when compared to the usual store bought jerky considering it's the true western style jerky that is sometimes hard to find. It's sliced really thing and dried thoughly, but the flavor is definatly not lacking at all once you take a bite, I actually think the texture of it is the best part. You can chew off a piece and savor the flavor for quite a awhile and is a welcomed difference to the norm. It's also strangely addicting and one piece goes a long way which is a good thing as I don't usually want to stop eating it once I start. I can't wait to share this with my friends and see what they think.

review/summary: Good flavor...Some tough parts
review/text: I ordered this and the spicy from Buffalo Bills bills and this was definitely better than the spicy.  This has a good peppery flavor and it's a lot of jerky.  You will need scissors or a knife to cut pieces that you can eat.  The slabs are like 7 X 10.<br /><br />Like with the spicy jerky I'm not so sure this is the best quality meat.  My package still has plenty of fat, gristle, and tough pieces of things you just cant chew up.  I've tried lots of jerky and with good quality jerky I could eat a whole pound bag and never have the fat, gristle, and pieces I can't chew up like this.<br /><br />Bottom line...This is better than the grocery store/gas station jerky and if I rated on just flavor I would give it 4 stars but the tough pieces that you can't chew takes away from the overall quality experience.  Since I have had plenty of jerky that's not like that I know it can be done.<br /><br />UPDATE...<br /><br />Promptly after placing the review I received a call from Choo Choo R Snacks asking about my review.  Based on my review the premium jerky was recommended and if I would like they would sound out 2lbs.  If I didn't care for those I was offered a full refund on my purchase.  That is great customer service!  I'm happy to say that the premium jerky arrived today and is fantastic.  It's on par with the best trade show jerky mentioned above that I have had.  Thank again for turning a potential bad experience into a great one.

review/summary: Magically delicious!
review/text: This is the most magical beef jerky I ever ate. It came in many a paper like sheet, and everyone at work loved it.  Right after eating aforementioned jerky, I turned into a cow, and spent the rest of the day having a crazy adventure, during witch I stopped a swarm of evil grass from taking over the world.  It began when I over herd a rouge blade of grass discussing it with a clover, who he had been shagging.  I followed him, and finding their hide out, located under the upside down kiddy pool in my yard, I devoured the lot of them.  After saving the world, I turned back into a human, and had another piece.  It did not happen again, but it must be like Narnia, and when the world needs the cool cow again, I will be ready, watching, and waiting.  Oh, and ordering more of this jerky.<br />Review guidelines:<br />Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it.

It looked greyish rather than the richer cinnamon-brown color of porcini powders that I have purchased in the past from another company.  More importantly, tasted/smelled like "watered down" porcini, not 100% porcini.  Looks like a 'bait and switch' to me and we will definitely not order again.

review/text: Very happy with this powder. I sue it when I want to add richness to soups, stocks, stews, whatever. A little bit adds a subtle amount of umami and richness (not necessarily identifiable by most as mushroom flavor), and if you use more the mushroom flavor is more pronounced. It doesn't take much to really enhance whatever you put it in.

You can get all the flavors at the Kernel Seasons site 10 for $30 with free shipping, so don't pay the unbelievably high prices for some of the other flavors I saw here on Amazon.

review/summary: LOVE this caramel flavor!!!
review/text: I absolutely love the Kernel Season's caramel seasoning.  I recently ordered many different varieties from the company's website.  I wanted to try several before committing to purchasing 6 of one type from Amazon.  I went through the caramel extremely quickly and ordered a 6 pack from Amazon.<br /><br />The main ingredients are sugar and brown sugar, so it doesn't quite taste like caramel.  It is very sweet and very good, though.  It definitely takes care of my sweet cravings.<br /><br />I found that I tend to used less of it if I use it on kettle corn (I use 94% fat free Orville) and a butter Pam-type spray.  The spray helps it stick and with the sweetness of the kettle popcorn flavor, I do not need to use quite as much of the caramel flavoring to be satisfied.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this caramel seasoning if you like popcorn and want to have a sweet treat!!

review/text: I love this stuff. I don't know why, but anything that would go good with caramel goes great with this. Its like having perfect caramel flavoring in a bottle.<br /><br />However, particularly for popcorn, the dry particles end up either on the bottom or in cracks of the popped corn. Since your tongue doesn't get into those areas, you don't taste it as strong as you do on wet foods. The trick I learned with popcorn is to take either melted butter or just corn oil and mix this into the oil first and then drizzle the mixture onto the popcorn. It make it taste that much better.

And it does have a strange aftertaste.<br />I tried it on my oatmeal, and it is good, but not great.<br />I got the cheese flavor for my wife and she doesn't like it at all. And she LOVES cheese popcorn.<br />So, our experience is not real positive. Difference in tastes I guess.<br />Not a total loss, however, since I bought 2 boxes (1 caramel, 1 cheese) and there were 6 in each box.<br />I couldn't return them, so I put the ones we hadn't opened in a Christmas basket I made up for work.<br />They disappeared in a couple of days, so maybe some of my co-workers will like it and buy more.

review/summary: Good for the most part
review/text: The first time I got this it was amazing and it went extremely well with popcorn. The second time, about half of them were completely messed up. Instead of being caramel and sugar they were caramel salt flavored with a heavy emphasis on the salt. This is an excellent product, but it is not worth the price when half the order is messed up.

review/summary: Not for popcorn
review/text: OK, I decided I was spending too much on bag popcorn so I went airpop and thus far it's gone pretty well.  I see this I got super excited I could have a guilt free sugary snack for about 100 calories that would also fill me up.  Wrong.  There are no free lunches in nature.  If something looks too good to be true, it is.  Whenever I use this it ALL falls to the bottom, it just doesn't stick to the popcorn.  No matter how much I shake it the seasoning will just not stick, at all.  I wind up getting plain flavorless popcorn every time.<br /><br />The taste?  Taste like caramel dust, which is pretty tasty but it's weird to taste caramel in that form.  I've noticed a strange after taste as well that goes through your mouth and out through your nose which is quite unpleasant.  OK so why did I give it 2 stars instead of 1, you say?  I LOVE this on oatmeal.  This is such a perfect topping for oatmeal, there's no after taste and you get a nice rich caramel taste with otherwise plain oatmeal.<br /><br />So, for what's it advertised, it's not very good, at all but.... on oatmeal?  Awesome.  It also tastes ok on apples and I wouldn't recommend it on ice cream.  I wouldn't buy this again all in all and I'm hesitant to buy another flavor judging by the lack of sticking to popcorn this flavor did.  Disappointment but salvaged in the end.

review/summary: Updated - Now BPA Free available
review/text: UPDATE  - I heard that Muir Glen had started transitioning their canned tomato products to BPA free cans but when contacting Muir Glen (General Mills), I kept getting a canned (no pun intended) response that they believe BPA is safe...blah blah blah.  But today, I finally got the answers I was looking for including how to tell which cans at the grocery store are BPA free.  Muir Glen started transitioning to BPA free cans (for their tomato products only) in September 2010.  Their shelf life is 2 1/2 years; therefore, an expiration date after March 2013 should be a BPA free can liner.  You can confirm it is BPA free when you open the can because the old BPA liner was white, but the new BPA free liner is a copper color.  I did ask General Mills to please label their products BPA free to help us consumers when shopping.  I hope that eventually all canned goods will be BPA free.  Let me know what you find when shopping.<br /><br />I am so excited to have a BPA free Organic tomato product, yay!  Thanks Muir Glen!<br /><br />Old Review -<br /><br />I love Muir Glen tomato products but sadly I had to give them up due to their can liners containing bisphenol A (BPA). I will not feed anymore BPA to my kids! I don't know why anyone is surprised that BPA acts like a synthetic estrogen therefore an endocrine disrupter--BPA was ORIGINALLY developed in the 1930s as a synthetic estrogen drug for women. Shortly after it was developed, a new synthetic estrogen drug came out (DES--remember how many women died of cancer because of DES?) so BPA fell by the wayside until someone figured out it could be used in plastics and can liners to help make them harder.<br /><br />I wrote to Muir Glen to see if they had any plans to try and remove BPA from their cans but they did not respond to me. Some companies are concerned and working to remove BPA (Eden Organics) while others are defending BPA--they are the ones that really upset me (Del Monte and Coca Cola are some of the worst--I won't buy ANY of their products anymore). Eden Organics has removed BPA from their canned bean products and is working to remove it from their canned tomato products.  Vital Choices is the only company I know of that has gone 100% BPA free but they sell mostly canned fish and a few other products but no canned tomatoes.<br /><br />I have switched to fresh food or jarred foods--no more cans for our family unless they are BPA free.  The lids of most jars have a little BPA but so much less BPA is leeched out compared to a whole can lining, still I would prefer NO BPA.  It just makes me sick that I fed my children with baby bottles that contained BPA.  I gave my children synthetic estrogen!  We already have prostate cancer in our family, and now I have increased my son's chance of prostate cancer even more by using BPA estrogen laden baby bottles--ugh!!!!!<br /><br />Contact Muir Glen and tell them you want BPA free cans!  We as shoppers, have a lot of power if we decide to use it.  In fact, contact all the companies that you buy canned goods from and let them know you don't want to feed your family BPA anymore.<br /><br />Let me know if you find any tomato products (diced, crushed, paste, ...) that are BPA free by responding to this comment--I will get an email.  I desperately want to make my chicken cacciatore again!<br /><br />I just read some more about BPA, Minnesota has banned BPA and several states are also trying to pass legislation to do the same.  So write to your legislators about banning BPA!  I also read the following from Fran Pavley the sponsor of California's BPA ban:<br /><br /> "Well over 100 independent academic and government peer-reviewed studies have linked BPA to a host of problems, including brain and developmental damage, breast and prostrate cancer, early puberty, obesity, infertility, miscarriage and hyperactivity. Young children and babies are particularly vulnerable because their body systems are still developing.<br /><br />Still, the chemical industry remains in denial. It has employed more than a dozen lobbyists to kill my bill.  Lobbyists for popular formula brands are roaming the halls of the Capitol, telling my colleagues that alternative products aren&iexcl;�t available, and a ban on BPA could cause a formula shortage. Yet at the same time, these companies are marketing a variety of formula and food containers to parents as "BPA free"."<br /><br />Scary!!!

review/summary: great value and no more BPA liners
review/text: We mainly use this in conjuction with the 28 ounce cans of crushed tomatos to make the America's test kitchen Spaghetti Sauce. It was a top pick in the cookbook which is why I started buying it and I agree.  Also makes decent salsa in the winter if you really let the tomatos drain. (Another test kitchen tip).  They are canned within hours of being picked and the cannery is next to the fields so are super ripe when picked.  It shows in the flavor.  I just read on the Muir Glenn site they are moving to BPA free liners beginning the harvest of 2011?  There is no date on the News Article so maybe it was 2010.  I hope Amazon updates the title so we know if they are BPA free.

review/summary: Great product, but toxic liner
review/text: The new studies being reviewed by the FDA about Bisphenol A are important.  Muir Glen does consistently have one of the best canned tomato products on the market, but those can liners are a real problem because the contain Bisphenol A, like most other cans.  It would be nice if they got rid of those types of liners.  Ten states have bans pending and Congress is investigating the institute that says it was safe.

review/summary: More delicious than the canned diced tomatoes sold by Costco
review/text: Muir Glen excludes the tough part of the tomato which connects to the stem.  Also, Muir Glen adds a generous amount of tomato sauce to the diced tomatoes.  As a result, this product is more delicious than the canned diced tomatoes sold by Costco.  Also, this product contains a high amount of vitamin C, vitamin A (as beta carotene), vitamin E, vitamin K1, niacin, choline, fiber, and lycopene and contains just a moderate amount of folate, other B vitamins, and betaine.  Only 90 calories per can.<br />August Update:  The cans I received in June, 2012 still had the white, plastic inner lining but the cans I received in August, 2012 had the shiny, metallic, brass inner lining, which is BPA-free.<br />September Update:  The shiny, metallic inner can lining now looks like it's 100% pure copper, not brass.  If these cans get dented, the copper lining would be more flexible and less likely to chip off than a brass lining, which would contain zinc, a very beneficial immune system booster.  Actually, the "brass" inner lining of the past might just have been a thinner copper plating over the soft steel inner can.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to find the No Salt version with an expiration code of March 2013 and later.  I've been to Whole Foods, Sprouts and Target and only managed to find one can with an expiration code of March 2013. I purchased two cans with a date code of February 23, 2013 and they still had a BPA liner. Until the ones with an expiration code of March 2013 are more readily available, I'll be purchasing the No Salt version from Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. Theirs don't contain a BPA liner.

General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Urban Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store.

I usually brew 6 cups every morning for me and my roomate and I still have about 7 sample packs left since November (3 Months). Really my only complaint is that there was no "Plain Coffee" variety in the sampler. Raspberry, Chocolate, Creme Brulee, etc, are nice, and the sampler came with just enough of each flavor that it didn't get bothersome, but for a long period of time I'm really looking for just a traditional brew as opposed to novelty flavors. All in all I will definitely be purchasing my beans from [...], from now on, because they roast directly before packaging and deliver next day. I am in New Jersey though, about an hour from their HQ, shipping time is probably longer to areas further away.

review/summary: Health benefits had been scientifically proven!
review/text: Pleased with the product's quality and price. Packaging is good and very practical. Good value for money.<br /><br />Avoid buying flax powder, as the oil content starts to oxidize immediately upon exposure to air - this makes them rancid-tasting and unhealthy. Flax seeds are very healthy and should be used daily. Flax seeds contain Omega 3 fatty acids that are good for your health. Buy organic, brown or golden whole flax seeds they are inexpensive and you can keep them in a cool, dry pantry for up to one year.<br /><br />You cannot digest whole flax seeds (they will pass right through your digestive tract), you have to grind them up - use a regular, coffee grinder. Eat them within 15 minutes of grinding, and discard what's left, don't save the powder. Taken with any meal, ground flaxseed makes you feel full and satisfied longer. Moreover, its oil content protects the lining of your digestive tract, so it's perfect if you have a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />You will love ground flax seeds sprinkled on your salads or cooked vegetables. They're simply delicious mixed in fruit smoothies, protein shakes, yogurt, soups, or oatmeal. Just make sure that you take it with plenty of fluids 10 times the amount of ground flaxseed,otherwise it could cause constipation<br /><br />Normal daily serving is about 2 full tablespoons per 100 pounds of body weight; that's about 20 grams and 90 calories.<br /><br />List of health benefits of flax seeds:<br /><br />*Improve the cardiovascular health, lowers the blood pressure, "bad" cholesterol (LDL) and blood triglyceride values.<br /><br />*Prevent arterial clots that may result in strokes, heart attacks and thromboses.<br /><br />*Boost the immune system, reduces the inflammation in the body, and relieves asthma.<br /><br />*Support healthy joints and improves the absorption of calcium.<br /><br />*Soothe ulcers, irritable bowel disorders, and improves colon health, lowering the risk of colon cancer.<br /><br />Flax seeds are the richest source of lignans. These are phytoestrogens with powerful antioxidant, anti-tumor, anti-viral, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial properties, 100 times more than the next best source - wheat bran.<br /><br />And that's not all.<br /><br />To fully realize the flax seeds benefits related to weight loss, you should understand one more thing. Its lecithin content dissolves the fats from food in your digestive tract and then the fiber and mucilage content trap these nasty fats, taken them to be eliminated from your body, rather than being stored as body fat.<br /><br />I don't claim to be a doctor but, I can read this is what I  have learned about the Flax seed: In short, ground flaxseed has been consumed widely in Europe and Asia, introduced to North America during Colonial days, but not widely used as food until the 1960s', when flaxseed health benefits had been scientifically proven.

review/summary: Salada green Tea
review/text: First, the package that arrived was extremely well packed.  This is tea for tea lovers.  It is water decaffeinated, something that you can tell right away when compared with any other supermarket green teas.  It is refreshing every time.  A gentle lift to start the day, and anytime during the day - no jitters, which some decaf tea gives you.  Flavor is distinct.  I have been drinking this succulent beverage for many years.  Sorry supermarkets have chosen to discontinue carrying the Salada brand, and happy I can get it online at Amazon.

review/summary: Italian Sausage Success
review/text: This is a great blend for Italian Sausage. It makes a mild sausage with a little kick. It does 50 lbs of sausage and I make it in 10 lb batches. I measured the level of the blend(5") and with a permanent marker made lines every inch on the container for my 10 lbs of meat. I ground up my shoulders, mixed in the spices, then reground a second time. Some of the best sausage I have ever had. Tastes like NY style sausage with the fennel in it. I would recommend to anyone who is looking to save money on sausage. I estimated I have about 1.75 a pound into it where store bought is over 3.50 a pound. It is also very healthy. I will be purchasing other blends in the future to also try.

review/summary: Mild/Hot Italian Sausage seasoning
review/text: We followed the directions closely for a 10 lb. mix of 1/2 venison and 1/2 pork. (We did mix the seasoning directly into the meat, then added a bit of water.) We then let it sit overnight in the refrigerator.  We fried some patties up the next morning to taste test.<br /><br />The pepper seasoning came through, not excessively so, but it did linger a bit.  I have been known to like things hot (although my tastes have mellowed with age) and I would rate this between mild and medium.  I have tasted commercially prepared breakfast sausage that tasted hotter.  It definitely makes this a great sausage for using in spaghetti and other italian dishes.  By itself, the sausage is very flavorable.  We plan to pack 1/2 into casings and bulk store the rest for cooking Italian dishes.<br /><br />I do agree with one reviewer, it is a bit salty tasting and could be toned down a bit.  But, it is within the limits for a spicy sausage and will be fine used in other Italian recipes, IMHO.<br /><br />I would buy this again, but back off of the amount to mix into the meat (due to the salt) and add other Italian seasonings.

review/text: I did a lot of research about the different tuna species sold in canned form -- which are healthiest, which have less mercury, which are overly harvested, etc.  This was one of the few that I feel comfortable and safe eating.  It has a great flavor and firm texture. I buy the unsalted variety.  It's not the kind that dissipates into mush when you add it to things.  I can add it to a stir-fry, casserole, or sandwich, and it always holds together in chunks.  I would highly recommend it.  Also, I contacted the company to ask a couple questions, and they were very friendly and happy to assist me.

review/text: I have been looking for a melon flavor to add to my drinks - this is really good flavored drink mix.  I have been making smoothies with milk but have wanted to get away from adding milk so I only make this with water and it's really good.  More refreshing than with milk and the flavor holds up with water and ice.  I use about 3 tablespoons to 16oz water and top off with ice in a 20oz thermos and sip on it all day. It really does taste like honeydew melon.<br /><br />I've just ordered the mango and will give a review on that when it arrives.  Very good line of fruit based smoothies.

review/summary: Product Comparison - Premium wins on Ingredients, Analysis and Price!
review/text: I'm going to preface this review by saying that my kitties are not picky about food. We've made sure to expose them to a variety of dry and wet foods since they were very young, and they are usually willing to try new things. That being said, they loved this food and took to it with no problems at all. I mixed it 50/50 with their old food (a mid-range name brand), but I didn't even need to.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients and guaranteed analysis in Premium Edge to our current dry food, Purina One Hairball and also Taste of the Wild which I was considering purchasing as well. I found the ingredients in Premium Edge much better than Purina and, in my opinion, even a smidge better than Taste of the Wild. For example, PE's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken, chicken meal, peas, egg product (also a good source of protein for kitties). ToW's first 4 ingredients are: Chicken meal, peas, sweet potatoes, chicken fat. Purina's are: Chicken, corn gluten meal, brewers rice, poultry by-product meal. No comparison there. I'd much rather feed my cats a dry food that at least has some "real" chicken in it, although chicken meal isn't as bad as some people think it is -- it's just ground up meat and other bits like bone and tissue (which they would eat in a wild or raw diet anyway!) Then there's the guaranteed analysis to consider. More protein is always better, since cats are obligate carnivores and would not eat carbs if they had their choice. PE wins with 45% protein, followed by Tow at 42% then Purina One with only 34%.<br /><br />And finally price... Price per pound based on Amazon price: Premium Edge 18 lb. bag was $1.46/lb., ToW 15 lb. bag was $2.26/lb., and Purina One was $1.59/lb. for 16 lb. bag. So again, Premium Edge came out on top. This is what I will be buying from now on, until I finally bite the bullet and move my brood to a wet food only or a full-on raw food diet.

review/summary: Purrfect For Our 2 Cat Family
review/text: Our two rescue cats are a 2 year old Torbie and an 8 year old Tuxedo. Both girls are inside kitties and get a moderate amount of exercise playing with each other and their 2 dogs. On regular dry cat food one of the cats has a tendency to 'tub' up rather quickly and the older feline's fur tends to become tangled and a tich dry with diet foods. This also leads to additional grooming and resulting hair balls.<br /><br />After surfing through likely food sites, I was impressed by Premium Edge's ingredient list, (chicken and salmon), target audience and price point in that order.  The gobbler preferring seafod blends, and the older girl loving chicken, it seemed this would be a good fit. But as any cat parent knows, the proof is in the pudding...would these 2 indivuals like it, really like it 18 pounds-worth?<br /><br />Both cats accepted this new kibble without problems...big sigh of relief there.  The formerly chunky kitty has begun to look a little more panther-like again, while in only a matter of days, the coat of our AMH tabby is soft and gleaming with less need for as much grooming. This is an added plus, as not every weight reduction formula out there will yield a nicer coat.<br /><br />Our senior girl can chew this small, firm kibble just fine, stools seem the same with the Premium Edge Dry Food and there is not as much hacking and hawking of fur balls underfoot.  ONe tip, since both cats become finicky with any dry chow that becomes 'old', with bags larger than 7 lbs, we are using a few Lock n Lock containers, with tight seals, to hold the excess, and keep at bay our pair of curious canine chowhounds.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: This purchase disappointed me for two reasons.<br /><br />First, I had never before tried the redskin version of Feridies Virginia peanuts, and I found them to be more like regular peanuts (like Planters) in both size and texture than the large, super-crunchy Virginia variety I was expecting.<br /><br />Second, the peanuts in the cans were a bit on the stale side.  Unfortunately, this is a frequent problem with nut cans that are sealed with those flimsy foil tops, but this was the first time I had encountered any degree of staleness with Feridies products.<br /><br />When I ordered these redskin peanuts, I also placed a separate order for the regular (non-redskin) Feridies Virginia peanuts, and they seemed perfectly fresh.  My guess is that the cans of redskins had been languishing on the shelf for a bit too long.  It would have been helpful to find some kind of "sell by" label on the cans, as the Virginia peanuts from Harry & David always have.

There is no burned flavor from over-roasting as some lesser French roast coffees have.  It is smooth.  I make it in the 5.5 ounce size, but my wife prefers the 3.5 ounce cup for the strongest flavor.

review/summary: I'll Take A Chance...
review/text: Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature.  Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way.  Not so.  It comes in a small box with little insulation and a couple of (melted) ice packs.  I'm going to eat them anyway.  I'll update this review when (if) I survive, but when one orders high-end food products, one expects first-rate handling of the product by the shipper. I'll be looking somewhere else for my next anchovy fix.<br /><br />Update.....<br />Well, I had four of these little things a couple of hours ago.  They are very good, and I'm still alive.  I've had better in restaurants, but these are better than any I've bought in a store or ordered online.  Still, I won't order them again because of the poor shipping practices.

review/summary: Love this product!
review/text: We just returned from the trip to Spain and decided to throw a party with Spanish food. But, what are Spanish tapas without anchovies! I could not find such authentic food in Austin, TX at any store. Thanks to internet I was able to get a couple of Medusa White Anchovies and they taste absolutely the same as we tried in Madrid! Delivery was very quick as it was promised and they were still chilled when we got them. It's a bit expensive, but it worth it.

review/summary: Tasty but arrived at room temperature
review/text: Very tasty anchovies, not salty, instead meaty and flavorful.  My only complaint is that it arrived in the mail with a completely melted ice pack (apparently it was supposed to be shipped and maintained at a refrigerated temperature, unknown to me at the time I place my order).  So, I took a chance and ate a few anyway.

review/summary: White anchovies
review/text: I was concerned when the box arrived dented and the freeze packs were melted. It did not say on the jar if they needed refrigeration.  I did use the anchovies and they were fine . I ordered them from Amazon because they are not available in our area and I needed them for a specific recipe.

review/summary: Tastes good
review/text: Arrived room temperature... but I knew that would happen given the other reviews. I figured they were probably ok still and ate them- they taste good and I didn't get sick so I think that it is fine.  I would purchase again once I run out...

review/summary: Simply the Best!
review/text: It's nice to know when you can't find a product at your local grocery store you can usually find it here on Amazon.  My husband grew up on Wolf Brand Chili in Texas and you can not find here in Kentucky.  Not only did I find it, it was very affordable compared to the link on the Wolf Brand website had taken me to.  I was hesitant to try "canned" chili but I was suprised that I really loved it.  It makes the BEST Frito pie!

review/summary: Best Pre-made Chili On the Market
review/text: This is the best pre-made chilli out there. Much better than Hormel or any of the other brands. No contest. It can be eaten alone or its really great for Tex-mex enchiladas or on burritos. Easy to make--just heat and eat. Can get it with or without beans, but get it without. They even have a lean version that's still good. Definite buy.

review/summary: The Best Canned Chili
review/text: This is simple.  If you're going to have canned chili, I've spent about 60 years determining that this is the best canned chili.  In fact, I'll go so far as to say that Wolf's beats most the homemade chili I've tasted in its meatiness (not always flavor) and that includes my time living here in "semi-Mexico" on the Rio Grande.<br /><br />And then all you need to do is add some seasoning the ladies here use.  This probably is a better base.  A little this, a little that and you'll be in ChiliLand.  Though I never bother.<br /><br />Need I mention this is "without beans"?  Makes a big difference, Podner.  Better to add a tamale or two than a bunch of beans.
