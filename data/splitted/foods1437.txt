review/summary: good food
review/text: The initial food of the cost maybe seem steep, but the ingridients are superior in quality, I like the fact that its made by a small company and I hope they wont be involved in any recalls. The food is very rich, so you're feeding less then cheap grocery brands full of fillers, meat feeds muscle not corn, my dog has several allergies and for a long time I couldnt settle on a food that didnt upset his stomach or gave him gives, bad breath, etc. He gobbles this up every evening and thinks its a treat.<br />Well worth the money spent.

review/summary: I really wanted to love this for our boy
review/text: We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that!<br /><br />For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AN2PUE">Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food</a> . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing. The Wellness  food brand was never part of the 2007 animal food recall list for melamine (rice gluten) and is corn, soy and wheat free.

review/summary: orijen
review/text: This is a super premium dog food, but if you are a first time user, beware, it can cause stomach upset and diareah.  Add slowly to your dogs old food.  Orijen has a high protein level and if your dog is used to lots of carbs, too much Orijen initially will be hard on the dogs stomach.  Once you incorporate this food slowly into your dogs diet, it is a great food that will make your dog healthy and happy

review/summary: Awesome Food!
review/text: Ok, let me start this review by stating that NO DOG FOOD WILL WORK FOR EVERY DOG.<br /><br />We have been bouncing around from food to food since Canidae sold their product to Diamond Dog Food.  We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, "beefy".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about.

review/summary: Gotta love this food
review/text: I started feeding my two dogs on this food a couple of weeks ago. I have a 4 year old havanese that is an extremely picky eater, and a six year old shepherd mix who has almost always been at least a few pounds overweight. I was giving them Eukanuba Naturals before this, which isn't cheap food. We have tried many different foods over the years for our havanese, and she barely eats any of them, always had to entice her, but she absolutely loves Orijen. For the first time ever she runs to the bowl and just gobbles it down. With our shepherd we have tried many different diet dog foods, and feeding her less and less, but no matter what we did she would never lose those few pounds, but after this short time on Orijen she has already lost 2 pounds. Orijen has much fewer carbs than the other foods out there, less than half the carbs of what we were feeding her, and carbs are empty calories for dogs. This food is great. My dogs absolutely love it, and I love what it is doing for them. And no gas!!

review/summary: Best Food Ever.
review/text: My 12 year old Golden was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  As far as cancer is concerned, it's one of the worst... prognosis is generally 4-6 weeks after diagnosis untreated, up to one year with chemo.  My husband and I decided we were not in a financial position to do chemo, especially to only buy our pooch one year, so I started researching alternative medicines.  One thing I read over and over was to switch to a grain-free diet.  Well, we had been feeding him decent food, but not grain-free.  So, I bought a bag of this.<br /><br />10 weeks later the tumors in his neck have shrunk without any medication, and you'd never know this dog has a death sentence.  He can digest it just fine, his coat looks great, he actually slimmed up a bit (which is great because he was a little chubby) and he just looks and feels fantastic.  I'm not saying this is a miracle cure-all and that the cancer won't get the best of him one day soon, but I am forever thankful to this company for making such high quality food that is making his time left easier and enjoyable.  Oh, and he LOVES this food.  Like, circles, cute noises, tail boogie-woogie, hopping etc.  It's almost like he's a puppy again. :D

review/summary: You get what you pay for: incredible ingredients but a little pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives (the food, in fact, contains ingredients that have never been frozen and so it is vacuum-sealed in the packaging--which incidentally makes the bag quite easy to carry). I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />Since it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content--which is used as a filler in all your standard grocery-store dog foods because corn is so cheap), I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. I swear I laugh every time she does it. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly. Husky's usually "blow their coat" once or twice a year with mild/standard shedding in-between; it was this mild/standard shedding that decreased.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.<br /><br />(Edited for typos and some added content).

review/text: My Australian Cattle Dog/German Sheppard mix is a very picky eater.  She loves Orijen. Right from the start when I put it in her dish she ate it up, and she continues to do so every morning.  My other mutt, the chow hound, especially loves this food and can't get enough.  I have now had both my mutts on Orijen for 8 months and will continue to keep them on this food.  They both eat it, their coats continue to be healthy and glossy and neither has had any digestive issues since I've put them on Orijen.  Great stuff, worth the price.

review/summary: Orijen and small dogs
review/text: As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: The best grain free dog food
review/text: Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.

review/summary: This food saved the day
review/text: I am not the review leaving type, but I do read them - therefore I must in good concience tell of my experience. This food is a life saver for my cocker. Our vet and the vet specialist suspected an allergy and he was on Hills ZD prescriptive food, the allergy manifested itself mainly with ear issues, not unusual in a Cocker but the ears went from normal difficult cocker ears to close to end disease ear canals with an ablation recommended. We did surgery to remove tumors in his ears, we tried expensive medication, he was still in pain.  Then, my vet ran out of the ZD. I looked around for another food and read about Orijen. We gave it a try, after two weeks the change was significant, his nose is no longer cracked and dry, his eyes no longer weep and his ears don't hurt him anymore!  They get better each day and I can only attribute it to this food. Try it, I am thrilled I did.

review/summary: Love it!!!  Shiney fur and no "dog" smell!
review/text: We switched our dogs to this food after reading about what is in grocery store brands.  I believe they were on Beneful. (garbage) The change was amazing! They have been on Orijens for around 3 yrs now and they are doing great!  We have a bassett mix, and elderly lab mix, and a beagle.  The changes in their fur were amazing! Their coats went from dull and dry to soft and shiney. We get comments all the time on how shiney and soft they are. Another nice effect is that since there is no corn in the food, our dogs do not smell at all anymore. Dogs cannot digest corn properly and thats why you get that "dorito" smell with the cheaper foods.<br /> Our older lab mix's arthritis improved drastically and he has such a spring in his step for an old guy (13yrs.) I honestly believe Orijens has added years to his life.  The beagle always had a touchy stomach too, and after the first 2 weeks or so he was doing better than ever on Orijens. They also all love it.  It is so worth the price to me as my dogs are healthier and happier.

review/summary: Great food for a Pomeranian
review/text: I have tried out food from Iams which is pure garbage, to hills science diet, which was not bad, to wellness, which my dog didn't like at all as it was hard for him to break down.<br /><br />When i read about Orijen and just by looking at the ingredients, i knew this product had to be good. My dog loves it so much, that where before he would eat half off the daily dose needed with other products; with orijen, he eats all of his daily dose and begs for more. this food is trully a great product for him and i am glad that there are companies out there who actually care about animals and what they put in their stomachs and not just money oriented. Sure it is expensive, but in order to use expensive products, money has to be paid out and all companies are not going to be running a business for free. i believe that if you can afford to feed yourself good food, then the animals that live with you should also not be deprived from good food either.<br /><br />thank you Orijen - Great product and i would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I have a 4 year old mini Doxie who was terribly picky about eating dog food, Heaven forbid. For the first 2 years of his life he would rather starve than eat so, of course, he ate mostly table scraps. Most of the scraps were a beef dish or raw hamburger. At about one year old he developed a nasty skin rash with lesions that flaked and the hair would fall out. A couple of Vets said it looked like Staph and we tried SEVERAL rounds of antibiotics and medicated shampoos. None of them worked. I finally got frustrated and bought a bag of Orijen adult formula and flatly refused to give anymore people food. Eventually he gave in and decided to try the Orijen. Within 3 weeks to a month his rash was totally gone, his loose stools firmed up and he has a healthy doggie appetite and diet. At his last checkup I told the Vet about Orijen and he was intrigued. Stated he had never heard of it but wrote the name down to look into it. If your dog has any health issues that are undiagnosed or seem untreatable, give Orijen a try.

review/text: My dog was shedding excessively and constantly had allergy problems, even on the once a day vet allergy pills. Switched her over to this food and she does not even have to take the pills anymore. Make sure to adjust the amount you feed according to the back of the bag as this will make your dog porky if you give it too much and do not have a very high activity level. Was very easy to switch her over. Mixed it in 20/80 with her old stuff and she picked out all the Orijen and ate it and left the old stuff on the first day. She was eating it regularly with no bad side affects from then on.

Not to mention the non-stop chewing and itching.<br /><br />Anyway I finally found out about Orijen on a Border Collie website and I have to say this stuff is magic.<br /><br />Within two days my dog's stomach settled, her fur is coming back to life and she is bouncing around like a puppy again.<br /><br />The itching is still going on but far from what it was and from what I have hear it takes weeks for the allergens to completely leave a dogs system.<br /><br />I fully recommend this product!

review/summary: Feeding Costs and Guidelines
review/text: Orijen seems to be what experts want us to feed to our dogs.  It smells nasty so we keep it sealed and the dog loves it more than Newman's Own (N.O.) Organic dry (no bad smell, dog doesn't like it).  We've always mixed N.O. with some (decidedly stinky) wet food.  Anyway, I've read that some dogs have intestinal upset with the Orijen food due to high protein content.  Others quote the high price of the food.  I agreed, but changed my mind when I read the feeding guidelines.  Here is a big tip from the Orijen people. "We recommend that you feed twice daily. Simply divide the amount suggested on the feeding guide into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog's ideal daily "maintenance" amount, always keeping in mind that a lean dog is a healthy dog!<br /><br />TRANSITIONING FOODS<br />"Dogs are often fed the same food, which means a sudden food change makes it difficult for their digestive systems to adapt. That's why it's important to introduce the new food gradually. Going slowly will give your dog or cat time to adjust to their new food and will also reduce the chances of digestive upset.<br /><br />"Start by mixing 25% new food with 75% old food. Slowly change the proportions over the next three to five days by gradually increasing the amount of ORIJEN and decreasing the amount of old food. At the end of this transitioning process, you should be feeding 100% ORIJEN." ~Quoted from the website of the Orijen dog food.<br /><br />COST PER SERVING<br />We plan to continue the small amount of Orijen and see how our 30 pound Border mix rescue handles eating about 1/2 cup of food twice a day instead of the 1 and-a-half cups of N.O. that sits all day until she decides to eat it.  So far, the transition period is going very well.  She does a pretty nice job picking out the Orijen kibble and leaving the N.O..  So, for 1c. per day, if a 1/2 c. measure of kibble weighs approximately 1 oz on my non-scientific kitchen scale, then 30 pounds of food for 63 dollars is about 16 servings per pound or 480 servings per bag - which is 63/480... about 13 cents per serving @ 2 per day = 26 cents per day?  N.O. is (subscribe&save .11 cents per ounce, but my dog needs (but won't eat unless mixed with wet) needs 3 times the amount (1 and-a-half cups per serving which is 6 oz. on my kitchen scale "20-40 pound dog 1-1/3 to 2-1/4 cup) per serving or per day, I don't know, but we feed her 1.5 cups twice a day (6 oz. x .11 cents per oz.= 66 cents x 2 = $1.32 N.O. per day) is still more costly than Orijen at .26 cents per day. So for us, at least, the transition is cost-effective.<br /><br />Given that a half cup of food per serving is so little food, I'll probably supplement her meals with something else. Should I let go of the N.O. kibble just yet?

review/summary: worth every penny
review/text: I compete with my dogs in agility trials, and wanted to give my dogs every benefit that<br />I could to try to enhance their performance and quality of life. I tried the six year old on it first, he had always been fed very good foods and eats well on anything, so it didnt surprise me that he loved it.  After a few months, I have seen a positive change in his<br />overall attitude and energy levels.  His "summer" coat is still decent too. I recently switched my 10.5 year old to the same food. He is more fussy, but he liked it too.<br />The first week he was on it 100%, I noticed he seemed to act a bit younger.  I really feel<br />the higher levels of quality protein and fat,in addition to the lack of grain, have made a difference in my dogs happiness and energy levels.

review/text: If you are reading the ingredient list, then you will see that this is one of the best food out there to feed your dog. grain-free, tons of meat. My dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) loves it, and it has never upset her digestive system. but every dog is different... it's not the food's fault, it just some dogs are more sensitive. Her coat is super glossy and she's kept at ideal weight on this food. Couldn't ask for anything more!!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: My wife and I are Lhasa Apso breeders. We switched to Orijen a few years back during that Chinese wheat gluten scare. Turned out to be an excellent decision. Our dogs love it and contrary to what someone said, there have been zero negative health issues. We've even got our Vet recommending it now. Yes it seems to be a bit expensive but you're not buying it quite as often because the dogs eat less. It's still not cheap but not as bad as you might think. Their largest bag lasts our 6 Lhasa's just about a month. I was glad when the Fish flavor came out a while back for a change of pace and recently have seen a beef flavor hitting the shelves that we haven't tried just yet. Very highly recommended!

review/summary: GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO SAMPLE
review/text: Orijen dry dog food is relatively new to me, (approx. 8 months) but not only does my German Shepherd love it..right out of the bag..but I always taste a sample myself! (Not something I would normally do with just any dog food). You'll find after opening the sturdy bag, the aroma of the Orijen dog food catches your sense of smell like a freshly brewed cup of coffee, or a piece of your favorite meat or fish.  I usually buy the blue bag of free-run chichen and fish product because I find it contains the most appropriate ingredients for my German Shepherd. When the box of food is delivered, she is immediately scratching the box to help me open it..she knows it's for her and can't wait to get her teeth into it. LORI, Phila.

review/summary: Going back to this brand...
review/text: My picky, finicky Chow Chow could barely be coaxed to eat any of the other foods I bought for her until I brought home a bag of Orijen. You would have been under the impression that I was giving her a bowl of raw (or cooked) meat if you saw her eat it and didn't know better. I've been using the brand for years now until recently due to the economy I've purchased a couple bags of high quality, less expensive food for my Pit Bull who has always had a healthy appetite... not too picky, so I thought it wouldn't make a difference, but after a few weeks now he's been throwing up bile the last three or four days in a row, and just today he threw up his food, so I'm going back to Orijen for him. I noticed there is some pro-biotic ingredients in the Orijen brand as well, so that may make the difference. Either way, I've trusted Orijen since my Chow gave me the "tails up" years ago! I also found satisfaction that Orijen was never on the dog food recall list several years ago when pets were dieing from a cheapened ingredient filler coming from a source that people hadn't known about prior... so I trust the makers.

review/summary: Excellent Quality!
review/text: When I first adopted my dog, I did a vast amount of research to find out what was truly best to feed him. He's a chihuahua mix, and as I was reading such mixed reviews about whether small dogs would benefit from a high protein diet or not I decided I just had to try it for myself. He did have a little trouble with digestion while I was transitioning him to the food, he was eating Royal Canin prior. He's been eating it for about seven months now and he's doing phenomenal. He has great muscle tone and energy. His coat is silky and shinny when it had been coarse and dull. Yes, it's on the pricey side but if you closely watch what you put in your body as humans why wouldn't you want your best friend to benefit from great food.

review/summary: BEST DOG FOOD ON THE MARKET! 10 STARS!
review/text: This is absolutely the best dog food on the market. No doubt about it. I am one of those persons who feeds his dog only the best. I eat high quality food, and I would never do less for my dog. I feed this to my labrador, and she loves it. We have tried other high quality brands -- such as Evo. While Evo is a great food, Orijen is just better. You can tell the difference. My dog is in perfect health. She is active. She has tons of energy. And her coat and teeth are radiant. People compliment her coat all the time. She is perfect. Orijen has changed her life. I will NEVER stop using this food!<br /><br />When she was younger, I used the puppy version as well. She loves this stuff. Eats is quickly and always wants more. The only thing she likes more than Orijen is my grilled chicken breast!<br /><br />Finally, if your dog has any issues with seizures, this is probably the best food on the market for your buddy. Do research on the web. And believe me -- you'll see the difference.

review/summary: One of the best dog foods you can buy.
review/text: I have been feeding my dogs Orijen for over two years now.  I was at a bar with a buddy and he was telling me how he switched his food to Evo and so I did some research on better dog foods.  I decided on Orijen.  I can't really tell if my dogs coats are better or they are more healthy.  On paper it seems to be the best food and it makes sense.  The food is sooo expensive and they jacked up the price about 6 months ago.  It does help they seem to eat half as much as my old dog food.  So, that cuts the cost in half compared to my old food.  A big bonus of this is there is half as much poop to pick up. That is huge as I am really lazy.  The other thing I noticed is both dogs had some nasty farts.  That pretty much stopped on Orijen.  Oddly my buddy said it will get worse with the higher protein diet, but it got a ton better.  I mean by dogs could drop some room clearing farts.  There are cheaper good dog foods out there like Blue.  I have thought about switching to it because it is 30 bucks a bag cheaper.  For now Evo is worth the money.  I can drop 70 bucks at a bar on any given night.  70 a month feeds both my large dogs.

review/summary: AWESOME FOOD!!!
review/text: I switched over to Orijen Adult formula almost a year ago (next month is my free bag...yay!) and I couldn't be happier. My 2-year-old boxer, Cooper, thrives on it. His coat is shiny and glossy, his eyes clear and white, and he has more energy than any other dog at the dog park. I'm not at all sure it's because of this food, but he lost some weight last spring and has since been a lean, mean, muscle machine. I'm talking LEAN. The vet says he's fine, and although I get lots of comments on how skinny my dog is, the proof is in the pudding. No dog can outlast Cooper, and he's just so incredibly healthy, I don't mind some bones sticking out. It's better than being overweight. He's an athlete. I think when I got him off grains last spring, his body shed some weight that it obviously didn't need. I would highly recommend this food! He loves it...I can even use the kibbles as treats. Combined with Grizzly Salmon Oil, I hope Cooper lives a long and healthy life!

review/summary: Amazing rocket fuel for dogs
review/text: My 6 year old cardigan welsh corgi was originally on Eukanuba, which was recommended by our vet. But she had dry skin, a dull coat and not as much energy as a dog her age should have. She also tended to become a bit overweight on it.<br /><br />Based on a recommendation from a corgi breeder & my own research into the premium brands, I decided to try Orijen. What a difference! Her coat is now quite shiny and healthy looking. No more dry skin. Lots of energy, and she has lost a bit of weight & looks more muscular & healthy overall.<br /><br />She also loves the taste - no problem getting her to eat it. But feed according to how your dog looks, not how much it says on the bag. This is high protein stuff & your dog will gain weight if you feed according to package directions. My 25lb corgi (yes, she's a bit on the petite side), gets only 1/2 cup twice a day.<br /><br />No, the initial purchase price is NOT cheap. But because we feed so much less (no grains or fillers), a bag lasts just as long as what we were spending on Eukanuba. FYI - I just got a bag of their 6 fish food to try & she is wild over it.

review/text: My dog has eaten this food for 19 days. So far he has not gotten an ear infection, but still shows redness on his paws. He loves this food. He somehow could smell it through this lovely packaging and followed me around while it was carying through the house. His appetite also matches the recommended serving suggestion, which is wonderful. I am going to order another bag, so we can see if the paw and mouth allergies go away. He may have a food and environmental allergy as well. I feel good about the ingredients and how my dog responds to the food. I think this bag will end up lasting an entire month or very close to it.<br /><br />The shipping was also super fast, so not only am I happy with the food, but the seller as well!

review/summary: Quality, not Quantity...
review/text: ...because it is FAR too expensive in quantity! :)<br /><br />Orijen dry dog food is rich in proteins as it is nearly 100% meat from a variety of pure sources: chicken, fish, etc.<br />We mix this dog food during the dinner feed 50/50 with lesser grade Iams Healthy Choices as I'm not so sure a pure Orijen diet is a good idea for our aging Rottweiler. The food smells very strong and it is a very dark color - very different than lower-grade commercial dry dog food.<br /><br />The bag is sealed when it arrives, and has a very good shelf life while sealed (air-tight) in the bag. When opened, poor the bag into a sealable (air-tight) container for storage and keep in a cool, dry place.<br /><br />The dog food is so expensive, one could actually cook fresh food for the dog at lesser cost. But there is an advantage in dry dog food in that it is more convenient, and the kiblets help to keep the dogs teeth clean.

I mix frozen green beans, chopped up apple, broccoli, and Kir yogurt or a small can of Chef Michael and mix it with her food. The cost of Orijen is irrelevant because as many of you have said I use a small amount of it. By adding different vegetables and fruit, everyday she has a unique meal. Polo is a beautiful animal and is exceedingly happy with no health problems, and my mind is at peace.  One size does not fit all but with a little creativity you can have your own win-win.

review/summary: good quality per my research but price... jeez
review/text: I'm giving 4 stars to this product because the price is sooo high.<br />But I would say this food is good quality per my research.<br />I used to feed my dogs with "puppy chow" and later when they got older "dog chow"<br />I have parrots and I always researched for the best food for them because I was a first time parrot owner. While I was researching for my parrots food I started to think about my dogs... so I realized I may have dogs for years but I never took the time to check their food.<br />Dog Chow is a very popular brand and I always though it was at least an average quality for my dogs that also eat fresh home made food.<br />I researched and find out that good part of the food is made by corn!!!! I felt so guilty for my babies and I started to look which dog food would be more recommended.<br />I ended up finding this web site: [...]<br />Based on the reviews and information found on the website above I decided to buy orijen and also Instinct.<br />Problem is that my babies tummy is used with "dog chow" and I know they can get sick with this new food even it's the best quality you can get. So I'll just start to mix a little bit with the "dog chow" until they get used with orijen and instinct.<br />If you are one person that knows how to prepare balanced and nutritious fresh home made food for dog I would say to stick on that. There is no processed food that is better than a fresh food. The trick about home made food is that you need to know how to prepare to cover all your dogs needs, if you don't know to do that you may ended up giving less nutritional food than a processed food can give to your dog.<br />Again, something I told before in a review. Please be responsible on caring and loving your animal. Remember you have friends and family, your pet has only you. You may live beyond 70 years old, you dog will have only 10 years to enjoy his life and will totally depend of you to be happy and healthy.

review/text: I mix this food 1/2 and 1/2 with Life's Abundance dry food.  This is the only concoction my dog gets.  She is now two years old and extremely healthy.  My previous pet, because of my ignorance, was fed regular store food plus table scraps.  Of course she loved those table scraps but paid a terrible price later in life with gastric distress.  I feel like I was a bad owner and let her down.  No people food for my current pet.  Her weight is perfect and a nice bonus is no begging while I'm eating.  I love her and don't want to bring her any problems we humans have with our stomachs.  This dry dog food is excellent.

review/text: Yes you may need to take a second mortgage out to afford this dog food but it is the first dog food that my dog is not allergic too.  So far so good as he doesn't itch anymore or bite his paws.<br />Just wish Amazon had free shipping and a subcription available, that could drive down the cost!

review/text: I've tried every one of the top 10 dog foods and this is the best one but I wished they made the kibble size a little smaller.  My small dog's teeth aren't that big or strong so the kibble size was challenging and I ended up having to go with the #2 top rated dog food.

review/text: I was worried that my chihuahua would not like this food since she is a very picky eater, but she loves it. Since she doesn't eat as much of this food, it offsets the price. It didn't take long for her to adjust to this new food. This dog food is great!!

review/summary: If I were a dog, this is what I would feed myself
review/text: You know how you are supposed to transition gradually to a new food? When I first started to switch my dog to this, she picked out all the new pieces and left the old stuff behind. (old stuff=Blue Buffalo). Now I usually prefer raw but will feed kibble because of convenience, but only Orijen or Acana (both made by Champion Pet Foods in Alberta). Orijen uses all fresh, human grade ingredients, with no grains, animal by-products, unnamed meat sources, or anything else I don't want in my food.<br /><br />Champion Pet Foods is an award-winning boutique manufacturer who does not outsource any stage of production or buy any supples from Chia. They are passionate about pet nutrition and the proof is on the kibble. It is highly palatable, nutritious, and safe.<br /><br />It is pricy and distribution is not as good as some, but well worth the extra effort and expense.

review/summary: ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!!!
review/text: I have two picky Golden Retrievers.  One girl is 8 years old and the other just turned 2 years.  It has taken me forever to find a good kibble they both like and I finally did!!!  I researched for the best dry dog kibble and came up with study after study.  Origen was either #1 or at least top 5.  I decided to try it and they love it.  You can even tell by the smell when you open the bag that this is a kibble made of quality products.  It will take time to see how their coats react to the new food, but so far the fact that they are both eating it with gusto is proof enough for me!!!

review/summary: Best kibble on the market
review/text: I have been feeding my German Shepherd Orijen since he was a pup (started on the LBP forumla). I love this food. He doesn't have to eat as much to maintain his weight...meaning less poop! His poop doesn't smell that bad and it is firm and good color. He LOVES this food too. Has a healthy coat and plenty of energy. No sign of anything lacking in his diet and no worries from me that it isn't safe to feed him. If you can't feed raw this is the next best thing.

review/summary: Incredible ingredients but pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives. I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />As it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content (which is used as a filler)) I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.

review/summary: The only dry food I feed my dogs
review/text: I found Orijen by reading online veterinary recommendations for the best dog foods -- dry and canned. Several reviewers put Orijen at the top of their lists, and it was almost always included in the top five. My dogs have been very healthy on this food -- and they like it. On the rare occasion when I had to switch to another dry food (another highly rated brand) because Orijen had not arrived in the mail, I noticed stomach upset and less enthusiasm about the food. In this household, at least, Orijen is the only dry food in the dog bowl.

review/summary: Why?
review/text: This is the second bag of Orijen grain-free adult dry dog food I have purchased. The first was gobbled up by my little Papillon.The second bag has caused her to have diarrhea,and throw up. I have smelled the food and it does have a sour odor. My daughter who lives in Austin,Texas buys this food for her dog and has had no problem. She buys locally. There is not a store in Amarillo,Texas which carries this brand. Could something have happened in the shipping of this food to me? The vet put her on Carafate and Amoxi which seem to cure the diarrhea. However, she will not touch the dog food now and I have been giving her Prescription Diet i/d (gastrointestinal health). I am puzzled. The date code is good, and the first bag was fine. I would appreciate any feedback you have on this product.

review/summary: Too rich
review/text: I fed my champion Shetland Sheepdogs this food for over six months.  A few of my dogs did alright on it but others had loose stools and lost on average 2 pounds from the previous year. Upon giving more food to gain weight the dog's got even looser stools.  I e-mailed the company about it and never got a reply. Coats were shiny but not good enough for show competition.  Since taking my dogs off this food they have gained weight and coats are coming in to the point I can show them again soon.  I do like the philosphies of this company with regards to ingredients but makes me wonder if no grain at all is such a great thing.

review/summary: Dangerous food
review/text: I am a K9 police officer for a fairly large police department.  One of our local pet stores recently started selling Orijens dog food and told us of its high quality.  It was supposed to be ideal for large active dogs.  Six officers transitioned their K9s to this food.  Five of those six officers have had to take their dogs off of it.  Two dogs nearly died from gastric and liver problems.  These two had to spend days overnight at the vet, one required extensive surgery to save him.  The other three also had gastric problems, but did not require medical attention before they were taken off the food.  All of the dogs experienced problems within a month, or even just a few days after transition to Orijens food.  Only one of the six dogs not experience a problem.  Use caution with this food and monitor your dogs for signs of bloat.  We will never recommend this product.

review/text: By itself the Blue Lemonade is very sweet and a bit odd. However, I've found that this mixed with the regular Lemonade. The mix gives just the right amount of blue "flavor" without having it be too lemon-y.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try as I think it is one of the better Mio flavors still. If you are trying to wean yourself off a sweet tooth, this makes a pretty good substitute. Think along the lines of a blue Airhead candy.

review/summary: Spectacular Flavor - Watch for side-effects
review/text: I really loved the Mio line.  Tried most of the flavors, liked most of them.  REALLY loved the Blueberry Lemonade.  Was great in water, but also in mixed drinks at Happy Hour.  Unfortunately, after about 5 months of regular use, I finally noticed a correlation between fits of explosive diarrhea and Mio usage.<br /><br />I searched online, and I'm not alone. It seems to affect lots of folks this way.  Most seem to believe it's due to the Propylene Glycol in it... basically the same stuff that's in anti-freeze.  The body can't absorb it, and it's a slick oily-feeling liquid, so it triggers a very negative reaction in most.  Since many things in modern diets cause a similar reaction, it might go unnoticed for quite a while.<br /><br />But when I stopped, the difference was amazing.<br /><br />so... sorry Mio.  So good, but not worth the emergencies.

review/text: This Mio flavor, "Blueberry Lemonade" is not the best of the Mio lineup. I would suggest trying other flavors first. It seems like an acidic version of the flavor in blueberry oatmeal flavor packets. The odd flavor makes it hard to quench your thirst and leave you satisfied. Unless you grew up drinking blueberry lemonade you will find it hard to like.

review/summary: Doesn't Taste Like Apples -- but nice ingredients list!
review/text: We love apple granola and try to eat Organic where we can..  So we did a shootout of Trader Joe's Organic Granny's Apple Granola, Nature's Path Love Crunch Organic Premium Granola, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDK5YY">Bob's Red Mill Granola, Apple Cinnamon No Fat, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>.  The three products list their serving size as three different sizes, 2/3 cup, 1/4 cup, and 1/2 cup.  So I normalized the macronutrients and sugars to a 1/2 cup serving for an "apples to apples" comparison.<br /><br />Trader Joes / Love Crunch / Bob's Red Mill<br />Cal 180 280 180<br />Fat 5.25 12 2.5<br />Carb 23.25 44 35<br />Sugar 6.75 12 4<br />Protein 3.75 4 5<br /><br />The interesting thing is that the Trader Joe's granola has hands down the best flavor, yet it has the lowest carbohydrate content.  Trader Joe's Granola tastes like an explosion of apples.  Next is the Love Crunch which has good apple flavor, but not nearly as good as the Trader Joes -- but with nearly twice the carbohydrates and sugar.  Finally the Bob's Red Mill Granola tastes nothing like apples.  Maybe if I held an apple slice under my nose while I ate it I could taste something -- but it really just tastes like slightly sweet granola.<br /><br />I do like the fact that Love Crunch includes Chia Seeds, but it has lots of other ingredients that I would rather avoid such as: rolled spelt (wheat)*, soy oil*, and rice starch*.<br /><br />Bob's Red Mill has the fewest ingredients -- if only the taste were on!  Trader Joe's has pretty good ingredients except for the corn syrup solids -- a big nono in my book but it is just above Salt (45mg of sodium) so it is probably a very small amount.<br /><br />In the end we chose the Trader Joe's as our favorite -- the lowest carbohydrate content and low sugars with the exceptional taste being the big draw.  After that we chose Love Crunch -- the best on Amazon when we can't visit the Trader Joe's 4 hours away.  Bob's Red Mill just doesn't taste anything like apples so we're skipping it.  If they made it taste more like apples we would pick it for the limited ingredients and lowest sugars -- but seeing as how my wife reaches for the honey when she eats Bob's Red Mill granola -- the low sugar is only temporary.

These granola's have the right amount of sweetness, without being too overdone. The ingredients are natural & don't have all that other chemical stuff you find in other brands.

You must treat yourself and guests. I have found that everyone likes it, so it makes a perfect tea gift for any tea drinker. The presentation tin is beautiful as well, so regal! Perfect for weddings.<br />smiles, Grace in VT

review/summary: Not a good place to buy funereal flowers
review/text: I ordered these flowers Friday morning after learning my brother-in-law had past away the night before. The Amazon Web page said one day shipping, which is what you would expect for funereal flowers. After I placed my order I saw that they were calling for a delivery between Monday or Tuesday. Going to the 1800Flowers web site I saw that I could have ordered the flowers on Saturday and still had them delivered on Saturday, but because I bought them from Amazon, I had to wait three days to get them.<br /><br />Monday at 3pm the flowers finally showed up. They were delivered by a lady in a small car from a local flower shop. I paid a delivery charge of $14.99 for a delivery more than three full days after I placed the order.<br /><br />The arrangement was very top heavy. I do not believe all the flowers were fully seated in the small base that they were delivered in. I set the flowers on the floor while I prepared to go to my brother-in-laws house that day. Next time I looked at them, they had fallen over on the floor soaking the carpet. I spent the next 30 minutes trying to get the arrangement back in the small base that they came in.<br /><br />I will never order flowers from these people again.

review/text: This sugar free, fat free pudding is amazingly good!  Even made with fat free milk, it's still very chocolatey, thick and rich tasting.  I'm addicted to this stuff.<br /><br />It also fits in very well with the Weight Watchers points program.  One serving is only 1 point!  Top it with fat free whipped topping and it doesn't change the points.  Seriously-- for those of you that crave chocolate and are watching your weight, you need this product.<br /><br />The only thing I find scary is that I think this is even better tasting than the regular pudding!

review/summary: First time using Fondarific
review/text: I have never worked with fondant before. I was not sure what to expect when I ordered this. However, in my opinion I had a great first time experience. The fondant was easy to roll out and I was able to cover the cake in one easy move. I found that it was enough fondant to cover two 9 in cake rounds with some extra fondant left over to make some ball decorations around the cake. I thought it tasted great and was a pleasant coffee flavor. I would recommend fondarific fondant to others. Just wish the other flavors were cheaper like the coffee mocha flavor.

review/summary: Much better than pills
review/text: One of our dogs whom we adopted as an adult had torn cranial cruciate ligaments in both back legs and a really difficult time getting around.  We opted for surgery on one leg to see if it would help, but the repair did not improve her mobility.  After two years of glucosamine supplements, she is tearing around the yard after our two younger dogs again.  It used to be a struggle to feed her the giant pills, and to remember them every day.  Now we just give the two younger dogs their Greenies and she gets her special one all at once as a daily treat--she views it as a reward, and it's easy for us to be consistent.  They are also labeled by week-day so that my partner and I no longer become confused about whether one of us has already medicated the dog on any given day.<br /><br />She has been on these for half a year now, and if anything, she has improved from her time on the pill supplements.  About a month ago she jumped onto our bed, which is about 3 feet off the ground.  We were delighted; for a long time she could barely stand up.  If your older dog has limited mobility due to joint problems, definitely give these a chance!

review/text: I have a 10 1/2 year old chow-shepard mix... a big girl about 95 pounds.  She started showing some signs of something hurting her as she laid or sat down and then when getting back up.  She didn't have a lot of energy to play or to go for a walk.  The Vet said she's getting arthritis we should try to give her some supplements.<br />We came across these at a mega-pet store and bought a package.  I've followed up with two more and about to buy another to be the fourth month of this experiment.<br />Does this work?  Well, for our dog, she no longer moans as she's lying down or getting up.  She's running around the house again, running in the yard after the squirrels and if we get anywhere near her leash, she's trying to get it off the hook for us to go, go, go.<br />Miracle?  Maybe.  Right product at the right time for my `pup'?  Yes indeed.<br />Do I recommend?  To every dog owner I know; and tell them Amazon has the best price too.

review/summary: No false claims here!
review/text: My dog has just turned 10 and we noticed on long walks, especially in the winter, she would get a little sore and limpy. While she's in pretty good shape and in excellent health, we were concerned about her joint health.<br /><br />My husband found these products at a pet food store and picked up a small package. For one week's worth of these treats, the total cost was $9.99.  I was skeptical as we'd tried a few other joint suppliments and not really seen any results.<br /><br />When I opened the package, I did appreciate that each day is labeled. When you have more than one owner in a house, knowing if the dog has had her daily dose can be an issue. This eliminates that problem entirely.<br /><br />We tried out the week's worth of treats and there was a small but noticible difference. Our bed is low to the ground and she had a much easier time getting up without straining and she wasn't limping after her walks.<br /><br />I decided to purchase a larger amount and saw that Amazon had the 28-pack for over $5 less than the store was selling it for. This made the decision for me and the treats arrived quickly thanks to Amazon Prime.<br /><br />Now, I have a dog who not only looks forward to her walks even more than normal but always is happy to hear the words "joint cookie" when she gets home from them.

review/text: I am so glad to have found this product.  My dog had a problem on walks when he would have to pull up his rear leg and hop.  As a puppy he was operated on with little success. The Doctor said it was common in Yorkies and there was nothing more they could do.  Now he is 4 years old and with the addition of Greenies Joint Care I rarely see him limp. He LOVES the taste, he can't wait to get his daily "bone"
