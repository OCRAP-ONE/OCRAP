review/summary: Great for Strong Coffee lovers--Simply the best coffee!!!
review/text: If you like strong coffee, this is it!  The flavor is exceptional, I have not found better in a can.  This can be expensive and difficult to find at your local store.  I have had great luck with Amazon, good price for the subscription order (you can get a case a couple times a year and still get the reduced rate).  Amazon also has a wonderful return policy!<br />Try Yuban if you love strong coffee and have not found the coffee for you, this may be it!  We have been drinking it for 10+ years now & have had the Original, Organic and Dark Roast---I dont have a preference, they are all excellent.

review/summary: Finest Around In My Opinion
review/text: My husband and I are always searching for better coffee...and seemingly there seems to be something wrong with them all! LOL I have finally decided that Yuban is without fail MY favorite coffee...it has no aftertaste, is not bitter in any way and it remains constant can after can. On that note, my husband can go grabbing different can after and grinding himself silly if he wishes;  complaining about each one...I'm settled on Yuban forevaaaaaaa. : )

review/summary: great coffee great price
review/text: Excellent.  We have enjoyed Yuban coffee for many years.  We recently tried the Dark Roast Coffee and would recommend it if you want a rich tasting coffee.  Smooth; with no bitterness.  Beats the high price of many "Gourmet Coffees" without sacrificing that delicious flavor that coffee lovers look for.

review/summary: Smotth and never bitter, even when made extra strong
review/text: Yuban makes the best cup of coffee. Either roast is never bitter, and makes a great cup of coffee. We like our coffee extra-strong, and we have been using Yuban for years. The coffee is very consistent and distinctive.<br /><br />This is the best canned ground coffee out there, period. We have found none to match the true dark, smooth cup of coffee. There is no bitterness or burnt taste, just silky, rich coffee. Add a dab of half-n-half, and you have bliss in a cup.<br /><br />Don't spend your money on the expensive "designer" coffees. This is the best!<br /><br />If you are persnickety about coffee, buy Yuban!

review/summary: Best Dark Roast coffee you'll ever drink!
review/text: Living in Baton Rouge my wife and I drank the popular regional coffee - Community Coffee, we now guess out of loyalty. When we became full time RV'ers in February 2007, we packed 5 lbs of that coffee but ran out in Missouri, so we tried other dark roast, including Maxwell House Gourmet Dark Roast and then the Yuban Dark Roast. OMG - what a difference!<br /><br />We'll never buy anything except Yuban Dark Road - smooth and silky without that burnt or bitter taste.<br /><br />Difficult to find in South Louisiana, but easier nationwide. Then there's always Amazon with delivery within 5-days!<br /><br />Ya gotta try it!

review/summary: Not as good as the Organic version
review/text: I was drinking Yuban Organic medium roast coffee until I could not find it anymore at my local grocery store so I tried this instead.  What a let down after drinking the organic coffee.  This just tastes like average grocery store coffee comparable to Folgers but the organic stuff, now that's a different story. That stuff is good. Tastes damn near as good as the fresh stuff you can buy at Dunn Bros or Caribou coffee houses.  Don't believe me try both this and the organic version side by side.  You won't go back to this again I promise you that if you have any coffee sense at all.

review/text: Until recently I thought that coffee was coffee but apparently it's not that simple. Drinking coffee can either be an good habit for the environment or a very bad one.<br /><br />The good news is, Going Green is easy! Look for the certification by environmental watch-dogs like the Rainforest Alliance and keep up the demand for Arabica (uh-RA-bih-kuh) or Rainforest Blend coffee; just ask for them at your local grocery store or favorite coffee house.<br /><br />GoGreenMart&More voted Yuban as a Product of the Week because the great taste helps wake you in the morning and protects the environment as well.

review/summary: I Wish They Hadn't Changed the Formula
review/text: I Wish They Hadn't Changed the Formula for the Yuban that was sold up until about 2 years ago. I even contacted General Foods and asked why they had reformulated their coffee and they told me they were going back to their "original" formula from many years ago. Why? They had a great product and now it is no better that any other dark roast coffee on the market. Yuban was a special treat. Now it is just ordinary. I still like it for everyday coffee, but it sure isn't what it used to be. Formerly, I even preferred it to Starbucks, but no more.

review/summary: The most popular snackfood in our night club...
review/text: I own a small night club and this is, hand's down, the most popular snack item we have. At first we were just giving it away until we started going through way too much of it to justify that anymore. In addition it is not available anywhere in town and, before we found it here, we had to go to a Sam's club 50+ miles away to stock up on it. apparently it is about as close to being the perfect blend for a wide variety of tastes as one could expect to find. The company also makes a "Club" mix, as opposed to the "Pub" mix. I made the mistake of buying a huge supply of that and met will strong and continued ire from our clientele. They look about the same but apparently the Club mix lacks some vital ingredient.

review/summary: UTZ PUB MIX IS A HIT, EVEN IN IRAQ
review/text: I received a whole package of this delicious, tasty, perfectly seasoned mix that contains just the correct variety of snacks (pretzels, crackers, nuts, etc) .  Of course, here in Iraq we look forward to receiving care packages and the awesome snacks they contain.  However, this snack was the "Cat's Meow".  It is honestly the best snack mix I have ever tasted and my fellow Marines agree on this also.  Once it was eaten by all, everyone was inquiring where I had received it and I could only say a caring patriot who included it in one of their care box of goodies.<br /><br />  I loved it so much that I ended up on this page because I decided to go online and search for it, and see if I can get multiple packages of this shipped to my unit here in Iraq.  I don't mind paying a few extra bucks for it, to have for me and my fellow Marines to enjoy.  It's just that good that it's worth it!!!<br /><br />  This is a great product and all should try it.  After you do, you won't think that Chex Mix can light even a dim candle next to the UTZ PUB MIX.  Believe me, try it, and you'll want to keep this stocked in your cabinet for everyone in your family and their friends to enjoy.

review/summary: Really Good..But Hefty Price...Anywhere
review/text: This pub mix is really a cut above your average snack to be sure.  I tend to pick up a tub of it at the local Walmart here anytime I venture there.  The flavor of it is really hard to pin down.  It's sorta a salty, garlic/onion/whatever type of blend that truly works deliciously.  I'm a self confessed snack-a-holic that has tried just about everything around, and personally I have not tasted anything that is quite like this blend.  It's really good with your favorite beer, or just by itself and I highly recommend it.  The only down side to this stuff is the price.  Which is not something usually cared about or taken into account with UTZ products, which tend to be very reasonably priced for the most part.  Unfortunately like a lot of things that are really good, this mix is not easily found locally.  I see it only at the local Walmart here in the small 20 oz size that carries a hefty price.  I buy it anyway on occasion for its so good, but make no mistake about it, its not cheap as snack chips go.  And unfortunately I do not recommend buying this mix on Amazon in any size.  It's way too expensive here for any deal currently being offered.  If you wanna try it or like it already, I suggest you search it out locally at your big department stores, (it's never found in supermarkets 'round these parts), spring for the price, and grab an ice cold beer and enjoy...

This provides an experience of, well, repugnance, at least for me; I've never been one to mix the sodium and the glucose, and this surely ain't converting me. ESPECIALLY when they're in the same bite/handful. Ugh.<br /><br />Otherwise, this mix is really yummy. It all tastes rather waxy, and I'm sure is not the healthiest food in the world (though you could do worse), but its a well combined mixture.<br /><br />But then again, I've got to sort of work my way through at a crawling pace, because I must grab a handful, and then separate the rejects. Maybe I'm just neurotic, or maybe they made A FATAL MISTAKE AND SHOULD BE PUNISHED.<br /><br />Oh yeah, like the last reviewer, I too got 'em at Costco.

review/text: Cat grass seeds will sprout very easily---you can sprinkle them on top of any kind of moisture retaining soil or peat moss.  My cats eat the sprouts very quickly.  I suggest that you purchase multiple seed packs.  I did so to insure that I would have more sprouts ready when the first wave was gobbled.  The only drawback is shipping cost--which is more than the seed packets themselves.  That's another reason to order in multiples.  The shipping cost for several packages is the same as for a single packet.

review/summary: Easy to grow and good for your cat!
review/text: Cat Grass is not only a treat that cats love to eat, it is also good for them and will help deter them away from eating houseplants!  My cat often nibbles on houseplants then throws up and I'm always afraid that it will do damage to her digestive system.  When there is cat grass around, though, she only eats that - she really chows it down, and it makes her happy, too!  Cat grass is also good for cats - it contains vitamins that may or may not be present in cat food, and it aids their digestive system and helps to eliminate fur balls.<br /><br />Even if you do not have a green thumb, cat grass is so easy to grow, that anyone can do it and it's also a great "project" for kids, too.  The seeds sprout very quickly (if you keep them moist) and will grow quickly to 4-6inches in a window sill.<br /><br />If you have cats, cat grass is a must!

W<br />ater until some of kit leaks out the holes in the bottom.<br />Place on a dish; put on the lid; keep out of the way for the seeds to germinate-- checking to water every 3 days.<br />Once the grass has grown about 2 inches, remove the lid and place in the sun.<br />Put grass in a new heavier bowl so the cats can't pull the entire patty of grass out or walk off with the container with they nibble it.

Cat grass only lasts a couple of weeks, and I would have ordered 3 or 4 packages, but not at 3 or 4 times that shipping fee!

review/summary: Grow Some Grass, Man!
review/text: So, these seeds do exactly as advertised.  I bought 10 paks of seeds, and have so far used 4.  I always get a pot full of strong, bright green grass, which my cat readily devours.  Not much else can be said.  Good deal, good grass. Man.

review/summary: Cat Grass, no longer just for cats......
review/text: I have been growing this "Cat Grass" for my 3 little dog, however I don't have the nerve to tell them this is for cats.  I noticed our dogs would occasionally chew grass at the park or leaves from trees, considering the chemicals that may be used on other plants I decided to grow my own.<br />My little guys love this stuff, but there is one problem being dogs they can be a little messy and they tend to want to rip the grass right out of the pot roots & all.  I have taken to trimming the grass daily and placing it next to their water bowl.<br />Trimming just seems to stimulate the grass to grow faster, much like your lawn.  As with your lawn I find that adding nutrients (Iron) to the grass it keeps it's beautiful color and many months of fresh new grass.<br /> Don't know the exact reason my dogs like grass, it might be just like humans we like a salad for a change maybe it just add something that is missing from their diets.  Guess you might say "Dogs can't live on meat alone" or something like that.

review/text: I planted this grass and in 8 days I had 3-4 inches of grass!<br /><br />The price hurts since you're basically paying for shipping. The cost of the seeds themselves are $1.59 as shown on the package. I couldn't find oat grass seeds at Lowes or my local independent garden center. I'm hoping to find somewhere local to buy them so I can buy more seeds in the future without having to pay a premium and wait for them to ship.

review/summary: Good Grass
review/text: The grass sprouted quickly, with a great germination rate. The cats LOVE it, so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while I was out of town. The pot was upside down for at least a day, and it looked like the grass was all going to die. However, a week later it has almost fully recovered, so it's pretty hearty.

review/text: Unfortunately, bunnies love it, too, so we are having to grow this batch of cat grass indoors.  The cats love this stuff:  just put it where they can reach it and they will "go to town" on it, munching it all up.  It does not make them behave erratically, like catnip does, so don't worry about that.  You don't have to do anything to these seeds other than press them into some moist soil and water when the soil starts to become dry and crumbly.  That's it!  A nutritious treat for your cats!

review/text: In less than a week, my kitties had grass to much on.  I was surprised with their reaction to it, it seemed like she was given this before at her previous home.  She rushed right to it as soon as she saw it and gnawed it down to nothing.  The first time it got eaten, the plants sprang back to life and grew faster than before, but after being annihilated a second time, the grass kind of dried up and died.  Which is okay, because I have plenty more seeds in the pack.

review/summary: Pretty decorative grass but puts feline vomits stains all over the home
review/text: Don't know why people want to step in cold cat vomit on their to the bathroom in the middle of night, but this will get the job done. Vomit stains carpets, beds, shirts. You will find hard, old fossilized vomit under beds occasionally too.  Entire rooms of carpet will need replacing.<br /><br />If you have all wood floors and love cat vomit, go for it.<br /><br />However, it is a beautiful decorative grass when potted on it's own or mixed with herbs. Just keep out of cat's reach. Good air freshener if you grow enough indoors.<br /><br />No idea why people want cat vomit indoors though.<br /><br />3 stars because it is wheat grass which can be bought in bulk much cheaper for couple bucks more.

review/text: The fact that the title of this product includes the number 3000 is misleading.  I'm not even sure what that number refers to.  I can tell you that it does not refer to the quantity of gumballs in the package (which is 850).  It's true that the product details stated the actual quantity of 850, but apparently I glossed over that fact.  The price is still a good deal compared to other vendors on Amazon; just not quite as good as I had originally thought.  Shipping took a week longer than expected, but I did receive and apology email.  The gumballs themselves were well packaged.<br />I would buy from this vendor again (assuming that the consumption of 850 gumballs does not kill me).

Fluoride is not healthy for anyone. If you want a healthy natural tea, get one that is made with white tea leaves. White tea leaves still have all the beneficial antioxidant properties but much, much , much less fluoride than either black or green teas.

review/summary: Should be called "Toasty Tasty Cherry"
review/text: Since Republic of Tea discontinued their Bing Cherry Vanilla tea, I was looking for a replacement.  The flavor of this tea is very different from Republics - it's better.  The smell is very rich, like toasted vanilla and cherry.  It almost has a coffee smell, but not quite.  I don't like coffee, but this tea is incredible.  Glad I found it.  Best of all, the price!

review/summary: Good tea with strong cherry aroma
review/text: I really like this tea, but my husband smelled it and commented that it smells like Robitussin cough syrup.  The taste is more subtle than the aroma.  Overall, this tea tastes good and is a good value.  It's not the best tasting cherry vanilla or cherry tea I have ever tasted, but I would purchase it again.

review/summary: Kona subscriber weighs in
review/text: I have a bag of this coffee shipped to me every other month. I do notice the flavor can vary over time. With that said, the worse I've had was just plain great, and the best roasts are to die for. I've noticed this variation with other coffees too. I always assumed it was the minute differences in roasting, and of course the bean itself. Being a plant, it will hardly have the exact same characteristics of another plant. Perhaps weather variations count too. This last year, the flavor and taste has been more consistent than it was a few years back. Everyone has different tastes but speaking for myself, this is as close to perfect as it gets.

review/text: This is by far the best Kona Coffee I've had. I use to purchase Trader Joes Kona Coffee but for the last several months they haven't had any and I've been unable to locate Kona any where so I thought I'd try Amazon. I saw this and although the price is staggering, the coffee is amazing. Very smooth with great taste. I drink it both hot and cold. A pound makes a lot of coffee and while I didn't figure the price per cup, I still think it's worth it and will purchase it again.

review/summary: definately worth it
review/text: I have tried a few kona coffees from different vendors, and I can say that this one is a very special coffee. I made an order last year and had some issues with one of the two bags I've bought. The coffee lost it's freshness in the 2nd bag and it was very old, dry and tasteless. I was very disappointed by how the same coffee could taste so different in each bag. I wasn't sure what was the problem, cause the 1st bag tasted very pleasant and aromatic. The freshness, texture and delicacy of the coffee took me to nirvana. I was very pleased with the organic taste and smoothness of the coffee. Immediately I knew that this was a very special gourmet coffee.<br /><br />I've tried different regional coffees including, papa new guinea, Kenya AA, Sumatra beans, Jamaican blue mountain ... and others. I have to say that Kona is my favorite by far. The shipping bag comes oxygen free when it's being shipped from the vendor. The air is sucked dry to vacuum seal it. Sometimes they get damaged or punctured during shipping. I guess that's what happened to one of the bags. As you know, coffee and oxygen don't go well together, cause once the coffee is oxidized; it starts losing its freshness and it doesn't taste the way it's supposed to taste.<br /><br />I've made a recent purchase again and I'm very happy with the results. Give this coffee a try before deciding to make a bulk shipment. You have got nothing to lose. Well done Hawaii Roasters. You guys have outdone yourselves.

review/text: This coffee, whether brewed in the Keurig via eco cup or in a standard coffee pot tasted stale.  Not the award-winning coffee that I expected to taste.  It didn't take me back to Hawaii, but instead took me to the Folger's coffee aisle in the grocery store.  Will not order again.  What a waste of money.<br /><br />updated 2/3/12 - The seller got in touch with me and offered to refund my money.  He apologized for the coffee not being up to standard.  The seller has good communication.  Maybe I just got a bad batch.  Who knows...  Thank you!

review/text: This coffee was delicious! I actually purchased it as a gift, but since I paid $30 for 1 lb of coffee, I tasted the freakin coffee!<br /><br />It was so good! I meant to purchase the light roast, but accidentally ordered the medium. It was full bodied and delicious, totally lacking the high acidity that you find with most commercial coffees. I can't afford 100% pure Kona all the time and normally buy blends, but this coffee is the delicious gourmet coffee you need to buy and keep for company or to treat yourself now and then.

review/summary: Kill Cliff Sports Recovery Drink
review/text: The best thing I like about this sports drink, is it's not an energy drink. Low calories (15) and less caffeine then 8 ounces of coffee.<br /><br />Plethora of natural anti-inflammatory ingredients, which mitigates aches and pains. And it's not necessary to take over the counter Acetaminophen when you have this.<br /><br />When I first had some, I felt different. Not a amp different, rushed. Just different; scared me a bit. 3 days later I tried it again. The feel different was the pain level going from the constant 8-9 to a 6 (which is manageable for me). The feel difference, was me feeling better.<br /><br />This is giving me the 4-5 year window I need before I have to get my neck and spine fused (again).<br /><br />At our house now, we have at least 3 cases and this month, it is 4.

review/summary: Holy moly!  where have these been all my life?
review/text: I picked up a package during an airport layover and since I won't be back to LAX soon... decided to check Amazon for some more.  The 4 oz package cost 7.99 at the airport, so you do get a small price break by buying them here in triple packs.<br />WOW!  The flavor is amazing.  I don't know if the other reviewer got a bad batch -- or what -- but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating.  One bite and I was hooked.<br />If you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie, look no further.  this should be in every adult Easter basket or Christmas stocking.  I haven't raved about a candy like this since See's dark chocolate covered raspberry cremes!<br /><br />If you like walnuts and dark chocolate, you will absolutely love these.  The taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe.  I just ordered 6 packages, for me and to use as gifts.  Amazon, you need to start selling these so I can use prime shipping!  (these will fly off the shelf, I promise!)<br /><br />ingredients:  Organic Walnuts, organic ark chocolate coating -- ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there, that's why it's so tasty and smooth.  Contains small amounts of milk, soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts.  Made in the USA by Tropical Valley Foods.<br /><br />YES, these will melt in your hand or the hot sun, so be forewarned!
