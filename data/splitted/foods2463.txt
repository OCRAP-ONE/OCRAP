review/text: As babies start to teeth they tend to want snacks like these that can be a bit more appettizing than a plastic teething ring.  They can even be a good source of vitamins for that picky vegetable eater.  Have ordered them several times in bulk.

review/summary: Baby loves these and ties him over in restaurants
review/text: what more could I ask for?  an infant that will sit nicely through an entire meal at a restaurant.....these do the trick.  I bought a little plastic container that is meant for little snacks like these, babies can only take out like one at a time (until they get a bit older wiser and figure out if they move the flap a handful will pour out) and he keeps himself busy with these.  Plus they are pretty healthy :)

review/text: The puffs are perfectly sized and textured for baby to pick and eat. Our baby loves it. It has helped to keep him interested in his meals a little bit longer. We carry some in a small container when we go out to keep him occupied when he gets fussy. The ingredients are healthy so I don't need to worry about him getting hooked to it.

review/text: What is it about these puffs that babies love so much?  Both my kids could not get enough.  Currently, my 9 month old just loves them.  I like that they are organic and have less sugar than other brands, so thats why ive been a loyal Happy Baby buyer, even though i know several other brands are avilable.  I get the greens flavor.  I know there isnt much "green" in there, but every little bit counts, right?

review/summary: HappyBaby Organic Puffs-Banana is GREAT!
review/text: Wow! I had no idea how many different flavors HappyPuffs had!  We came across the 'banana' flavor recently and it is just as good as all of the others, from Apple, Greens, Sweet Potato and I've even seen Strawberry!  Banana though seems to be my little one's favorite right now, she's big into signing and seems to like banana everything! Banana puffs are a huge hit, the "banana, mango, peach" pouch too!  These truly do melt in her mouth which makes me comfortable with giving these to her.  I compared these with cheerios and there are a ton more vitamins and even digestion aids even in puffs which are perfect for a toddler.  With significantly less sugar then other puffs or cereals, being organic and safe to eat, these are a huge hit!  I also appreciate the amount of puffs we get in a container for the price, it's a great deal.  I have been even using the left over plastic containers for storage when we are done!  They are great little containers for crayons too on the go!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NXHY8Y">HAPPYBABY Organic Puffs, Banana Puffs, 2.1-Ounce Containers (Pack of 6)</a>

review/summary: Great tasting!
review/text: These Apple Puffs are my son's favorite flavor! And he is 5! We actually all snack on them. The Apple ones taste perfectly sweet to me, perhaps because we consume little to no sugar on a daily basis, so we can tell these are naturally sweetened, nothing artificial. Being organic and half the sugar content of some other Puffs are some of the reasons why we continue to purchase these. The list of ingredients is short and all things I can pronounce and identify!<br />Snacking is a huge part of a toddler and young child's world, so if my son enjoys these then I am happy with that. It's also great to have these around the house for when my friend's with younger kids come over. It's the perfect snack to offer! Give them a try and I don't think you will be disappointed!

review/summary: Still a Favorite!
review/text: HAPPYBABY Organic Apple Puffs are still a favorite of my daughter's, even after almost two years!  She just can't seem to get enough of them, and I feel great about giving them to her because I know that they are organic and so much healthier than other snacks she could be eating.  They are surprisingly filling, so one container will last us awhile (less so now that she is older, but still a great deal for what we are getting).  I am a big stickler about limiting sugar, so these definitely fit into my personal agenda and I don't know what I would do without them because to me there is nothing else out there that even comes close.  They are perfect for an on the go snack, and my only problem is the fights that often break out between my almost 3 year old and her 6 year old sister who also loves them!!

review/text: Love...love...love HappyBaby products and these Puffs are no exception.  I never would have thought my little ones would go for the green puffs (spinach and kale), but there is just enough sweetness to keep them going back for more and more.  My husband and I try to eat and keep as much as an organic household as possible, but it is really difficult with baby products.  I feel like with baby food you are either spending tons of money or sacrificing taste.  Happybaby does neither...I think the price is in line with all other baby products (and usually Happybaby gives you more food per container) and the taste is amazing. I will definitely be buying this again along with some other Happybaby products.

review/summary: Great for young toddlers!
review/text: When my toddler was transitioning to table foods, these were a huge hit.  She's always been on the picky side, but she's never had a problem with these.  We tried all the flavors and each one was a hit with her.  They don't have as much sugar as the Gerber Puffs, yet they are still pleasantly sweet.  They dissolve easily and my little one never gagged or choked on these.  I initially wasn't a fan of the price of these puffs - however - the container surprisingly holds a decent amount of these and it lasted quite awhile.  The ingredients and the fact that these are organic is also cool.  I know this is lame, but I'm actually sad I won't be buying these anymore as my 23 month old toddler is outgrowing them.  (They made the "baby shelf" in my pantry look so cheerful.)

review/text: Our daughter loves these puffs!  Our household is NOT all-organic by far, but compared to the other puff choices on the market, these were an easy choice.  They compare in price to the other sugar/sodium-laden puffs and are much healthier for your little one.<br /><br />We have not tried the other flavors.  We did start her on the green flavor (kale, etc.) and to be honest...it really has no flavor, which is good if you're wanting to start them on learning to chew and mash.

review/text: I'm a regular purchaser of a variety of happy baby puffs, and the Banana flavor are usually a safe bet and my son really likes them (Strawberry is still his favorite).  Buyer beware though, this most recent order for the Banana flavor came and it seemed that the sealing process was fowled on 4 of the 6 packages in the box.  Puffs absorb moisture like no other so exposure from a poor seal on the container meant stale puffs.  Will this prevent me from purchasing again?  No.  Usually my puff orders are problem-free so give them a try.  I'm sure your kid (and you!) will love them!

They dissolve easily, and are very easy for a little one with only a few teeth to practice chewing. They are also good for the dexterity and learning to pick up (pinch) the little bits. I give them to my son to keep him busy while I make his meals. It's like the instant gratification as soon as he hits the high chair. The ones in the supermarket are full of ingredients I would NOT give my baby and these I can feel good about giving them to him. The Green are great, as well as the sweet potato and banana. Buying them on Amazon, I save money AND they come right to my door- the next day no less! They should be called HAPPY MOM!

review/summary: The favorite finger food.
review/text: I will say I prefer the taste of the Green Puffs to the Banana Puffs but they are also well received by my little one.  I think that the mix of banana and apple winds up a net neutral somehow.  As with most things, I would probably pick up a single canister to make sure that your little one is a fan before getting a pack.  They definitely "melt" in baby's mouth so my 8-month-old has no problem chewing them herself.  They are bigger and easier to grab than Cheerios so she is able to (and loves to) feed them to herself.<br /><br />I am soooooo happy that they use apple juice concentrate rather than other sweeteners.  They are the only puffs I've found that sugar or corn syrup or any other sweetener isn't the second ingredient.  They definitely taste like cereal (rice, oats and wheat are the first three ingredients).<br /><br />I have found that the containers I've purchased are always full (within an inch of the top, likely from settling), so I'm not sure where the reviewers that say the containers are too large are coming from - maybe they got a bad batch?<br /><br />Definitely, one of the best finger foods I've found so far.  Easy to grasp, light (3 puffs per calorie), no sugar, no syrups and all organic.

review/text: I think that the listing has an outdated description as they now use apple juice concentrate rather than cane juice for the sweetener.  Both those I've purchased on Amazon and at the store are sweetened that way.  They are lightly sweet, but they are the only puffs I've found that sugar or corn syrup or any other sweetener isn't the second ingredient.  They definitely taste like cereal (rice, oats and wheat are the first three ingredients) but it's nice that they've blended in a little bit of veggies versus everything else that is either super fruit intensive or cheetos-lite.<br /><br />They are very light, but the canisters are completely full - I'm not sure why some others thought they were too big, maybe they got an off batch?<br /><br />They definitely "melt" in baby's mouth so my 8-month-old has no problem chewing them herself.  And they are bigger and easier to grab than Cheerios so she is able to (and loves to) feed them to herself.  By far the best finger food I've found.<br /><br />With Mommy's occasional snacking here and there (they are really good and there are three puffs to 1 calorie), I found the six pack to be a good amount.  But as with most things, I would probably pick up a single canister to make sure that your little one is a fan before getting a pack.

review/text: We started with the Gerber puffs from our local grocery store when our son was 7 months old.  I prefer organic products but our local grocer did not carry this item so I took the plunge and ordered these after reading the good reviews.  I'm so glad we made the switch!  These containers are larger at 2.1ozs than the Gerber Puffs at 1.48ozs, so not only are you getting a healthier product for your child - you're actually saving money!  If you do a side by side comparison on ingredients and nutrition this product is by far superior.  And they do taste great - even my 7 year old that avoids green vegetables thinks these are yummy.  We're keeping these on our subscribe and save list - thanks Amazon for offering a great product at an incredible price. :)

review/text: The delivery of my mini star sprinkles was quick. When I opened the box, I was pleased to find a small bag of perfectly cut stars. Not a rounded edge one, but perfect. It looks like confetti you could set out on a table, only it's edible. I'm very pleased with my purchase!

review/summary: Depending on what you oil use, it can be deliciously moist or unappetizingly bone dry
review/text: This cake mix can easily result in a deliciously moist or unappetizingly bone dry cake depending on the oil used.  I used 1/2 cup of Canola oil in my first attempt to make this cake and it yielded a bone dry cake with an unappetizing flavor that seemed substandard even for a gluten and dairy free cake.  In my second attempt to make this cake I used 1/4 cup of Olive oil and 1/4 cup of Coconut oil and it yielded a moist cake with the most delicious flavor and mouth feel!  It was even indistinguishable from normal chocolate cake!  After refrigeration, the moist cake became dry, likely because of the coconut oil that hardens in cooler temperatures, but quickly reverted back to its deliciously moist self when warmed.<br /><br />I would happily cook with this cake mix again and serve it to my non-allergen-challenged friends and family!

review/text: This cake mix is wonderful, and I've recieved comments from people without allergies about how good this mix is...especially if it has the chocolate frosting on it! I've had people ask me for the recipe, and when I admit it is a mix, they insist on knowing what kind it is so they can buy it. My son brought them to school and all the kids loved them!

review/summary: Great gluten free chocolate cake...
review/text: My son has several food allergies. It is difficult to bake desserts for him because he can't have any dairy, wheat, eggs, or nuts. We tried the gluten free chocolate cake mix and made cupcakes. They were sooo good! I used the Pillsbury vanilla frosting in a can to frost the cupcakes and they turned out delicious. Even my non-allergic friends enjoyed them. I have also tried the gluten-free chocolate chip cookies mix and they are also delicious. My son enjoyed the goodies so much I am back ordering more.

review/text: I do a lot of gluten-free baking, and I'm always on the lookout for products to make this more convenient.  I love to bake, but sometimes, I'm too busy to want to do everything from scratch.  This mix made terrible, terrible cake.  It was spongy, rubbery, and had a strange bitter, chalky aftertaste (I blame an excess of starch in the flour mix).  It did not taste like chocolate at all.  All I can say is that I will never buy this again, and I'm glad I tried a bite of it before wasting frosting on it!

review/summary: Yummy and fudgy chocolate cake
review/text: Interesting to see the wide range of reviews about this product. One reviewer mentioned that the type of oil they used was critical and they had experimented with several and determined that half olive half coconut was best.  I used walnut oil due to its high omega 3 content so I figured at least my cake would have some health benefits :-)  I used a 9 inch teflon round cake pan. I also checked to see if done 3 times and ended up pulling it out within one minute of the toothpick coming out clean since I know how important it is not to overcook gluten free cakes!<br /><br />This chocolate cake has a moist and delicious slightly fudgy texture!! AMAZING for a cake without eggs, butter or milk!!!!  I do eat eggs and might not have even tried this mix if I had read the label more closely.<br /><br />My oven has been precisely calibrated using an external oven thermometer so I know the temperature is spot on. Many people use ovens that are not correctly calibrated for temperature (all oven manuals come with instructions on how to calibrate) and this can greatly effect the outcome of cakes which can be unforgiving when cooked at the wrong temp.<br /><br />I didn't try refrigerating this cake as refrigeration tends to dry out any gluten free product made with rice flour; the same happens to leftover refrigerated rice. I just make sure it will get eaten within 3 days of baking; not a problem with this cake! So if you can't eat gluten AND eggs this is a great mix. If you are just avoiding gluten it's still a great mix.

review/text: my son has multiple allergies (wheat, soy, dairy, eggs, nuts, beans, peas, corn, fish.) this was the only cake mix i found that was allergy friendly .  the only oil my son can tolerate is sunflower, so that was what we used.<br />i made them in a faberware metal cupcake pan with papers. cooked them for about 13 minutes. they were fluffy, moist, not dry at all! the chocolate flavor wasn't overpowering.<br />for icing, we poured some powdered sugar in the bowl we used to mix the cake (still had just a little bit of cake mix in it) added a little bit of water, mixed it, added  a handful of sliced organic strawberries, blended it all together to make a fabulous strawberry glaze.<br />we were pleasantly surprised! now my son can have real birthday cake this year. thank you, cherrybrook kitchen for making a great cake mix!

review/summary: I was impressed!
review/text: I needed a chocolate cake mix that was egg, dairy, and gluten free.  This was the only one that I have found that was egg free (and not requiring some weird egg substitute).  I used half coconut oil, quarter olive oil, and a quarter canola  oil. I took it out when the toothpick was dry.  I actually had planned on mixing in some chocolate chips into the mix, but didn't, and honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised.  Granted, I covered it in a sinful chocolate frosting, I thought it was great.  I really didn't expect an allergy free cake out of a box to taste this good.  Everyone agreed it was good, if not great.  Now, was it the best chocolate cake I've ever had, definately not.  But I plan to buy the 6 pack here on Amazon now that I know people will enjoy this cake if made properly -- just don't skimp on the frosting.

review/summary: Bland
review/text: I was surprised that this cake had such a flat chocolate flavor.  It thought chocolate cake would be one flavor that would be hard to mess up on.  Aside from a flat flavor, the cake was dry for us as well.  I know that I did not cook it too long either.  I had checked it with a toothpick a few minutes before the recommended time to be sure I didn't overcook it.  The toothpick came out wet, so I left it in just a few minutes more at which point is was perfectly done.  Despite getting it out of the oven at the perfect time, it still turned out dry.  I'm suspecting that another reviewer's point about too much starch being used is the cause for this being dry.  Apparently though, taste buds/texture sensitivities vary widely among people.  I was actually surprised to read reviews that said the cake was great, and moist.  So, if you're one of those individuals that isn't picky when it comes to food, you might like this cake as well, but I suggest buying a single box first before ordering in bulk.<br /><br />I wouldn't say that I hate it, and in a pinch it would do (especially if some chocolate chips were thrown in to help make it more moist), but it's definitely not a staple for me.  Just in case anyone is wondering, I used olive oil when making this.  I still have one box in my cupboard.  I'm planning to use that box to make cake mix cookies.  Hopefully that will produce better results.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: A friend made this mix for a recent gathering, and it was delicious! She used whipped cream instead of frosting and topped it with fresh raspberries. I don't think she did anything special for the oil content. The crumb was slightly dry, but not unpleasantly so, especially with the cream icing. The chocolate flavor had an extra dimension to it, as if a small amount of cardamom and tamarind had been added. Personally, I liked this flavor. If I buy a gluten-free dessert mix rather than baking from scratch, I will definitely consider this one.

review/summary: Make it right and it's awesome!
review/text: I read some of these reviews and I agree. You have to make this cake right for it to turn out it's best. I used this mix for my son's Birthday party. Everyone had cake and enjoyed it. They were all surprised to find out that it was Gluten(wheat), Soy, Milk, Egg and Nut Free. I do say that I make my own fronsting and that can a big difference on taste. My son is allergic to Milk, Soy, Wheat, Eggs and Nuts. When you cook without these ingredients it make's standard baking practices even harder. Here's what I've experienced. First, cooking in a Stainless steel baking pan will cook the cake much better(aluminum is fine as well). I've tried glass and the cakes never cook all the way through and come out dense. Second, the butter substitute mixture is important. I've tried the mixture of someone that made a review here(thank you whoever you are). I agree using a 1/4 cup Olive Oil and a 1/4 cup coconut oil is the best. But make sure you use the right oils. The Coconut Oil should be Unrefined and Virgin if you like a slight coconut taste(and I mean slight taste, if none at all depending on where you buy the oil from). The Olive oil is the same. Some manufactures have a stronger taste then others. I use "365" or "Spectrum" Coconut oil, Unrefined, Virgin. You'll have to try out a couple different Olive Oils. I used "365" Spanish Olive Oil. Baking variations vary even for standard baking. Hopefully this will help someone. Please post if you figure something good out. Good luck and happy baking.<br /><br />P.S. My apologies, I made a change to my review. I put 1/2 cup and I meant a 1/4 cup. I made the correction now. And I found one downside on this cake mix. My wife wants me to make it everyday :)

review/text: I just got put on a gluten and peanut-free diet a few days ago. I hate diets of any sort, am kind of picky, and needed to make a dessert for a family get together. I made the chocolate cake as cupcakes, with homemade coconut frosting. They were REALLY good! I had made regular brownies as an alternative for everyone--except they ate all of my cupcakes instead!  These make it a little easier to be gluten-free!<br /><br />BTW--Not sure if it makes a difference--but referring to one of the other reviews--I just used regular vegetable oil.

review/text: My best friend has Celiac, and doesn't do much from-scratch baking, so I am in search of a good chocolate cake mix for her.  This is not it.  I bought the chocolate frosting of the same brand, and it was quite good - it carried the cake, in fact.  Until I had a bite of just cake, I had no idea that it didn't have any flavor.  Seriously.  No. Flavor.  Not even cardboard flavor.  Flavorless fluff. Very disappointing. Now I know why my friend doesn't ever want to experiment with wheat/gluten free cooking.

review/summary: Jolly Rancher Twist Apple 160 Piece Box
review/text: ASIN B0014C5OB8 - My JR Watermelon review can be partly recycled here, since certain things apply to both flavors!<br /><br />One of the original Jolly Rancher flavors, and a lifelong favorite around here, the 160 piece box is something I generally pick up locally to avoid the shipping charges that come with ordering online. To make sure you get the best price on Amazon, take the time to do a search because there are several listings and the prices vary.<br /><br />From the crinkle of the plastic wrapper as you open it to the last tiny sliver of mouth-watering flavor, everything about these candies is a flawless-summer-day-in-childhood memory for me. While Watermelon is sweet-sweet, Apple is sweet-tart and will literally make your mouth water. As with all JR candies, you can smell them before you open them and the scent is a huge temptation. There's about 24 calories in a candy and, because they're yummy, I use them rather than cough drops for fighting off that dry mouth, throat-tickling cough. Any excuse!<br /><br />Also see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NME05Q">Jolly Rancher Apple Candy - 160 Count Box</a>.

review/summary: Lijjat Papad (papadums) for the CARB conscious!
review/text: I only recently tried papadums aka papads! Except I paid $3.49 a box in Atlantic Canada for only 10 in box! Buying Lijjat is not only inexpensive (I'm paying more like 60 cents for 10) but convenient online, and it supports a great cause. I need to watch my carbs as a diabetic and this is the greatest way to do it. Only 15 carbs for 3 of them. You can pop them in the micro with or without oil on them, you can fry them in oil if you want. They are lentil flour, a protein. They can be used as a light crisp chip. I have used them with tuna fish, made a mini pizza with them by microwaving three of them, then put on topping, cheese and scant sauce and put back in micro for 25 sec or less. I also scooped up my scambled eggs with them. I like the spice of the garlic and green chile. They are very light but can be used with a dip if you spoon it on. Unreal how good these things are! I'm shocked Atkins or South Beach hasn't been promoting these as low carbs, protein healthy choices!! They are truly a find... and a VERY healthy carb.

Stick each individual papad in the microwave (on a dish) for around a minute and these are crispy, bubbly perfection. And if it weren't for the sodium content, these would be very healthy, what with all the fiber and protein (and 100% vegan ingredients). Twenty packs might seem like a lot, but just watch these disappear!

review/text: If you ever go to an Indian restaurant with me, order your own papadams (English spellings vary). Once these delicious wafers get to the table, I suddenly become sharing-impaired.<br /><br />You've certainly seen them at Indian restaurants. They're the saucer-sized crispy wafers. Thin, crunchy, and often seasoned with big flavors (black pepper, cumin, garlic, or chilis, to name a few), these call to mind some Western crispy snacks, all of which pale in comparison. Made with bean flour, these offer a bit of protein with their crunch, but without a bean-y flavor. And, if it matters, you don't have to be a chemist to pronounce any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I've had a few flavors in the Lijjat line, including plain. I've had other brands, too, but this is the one I keep coming back to. These can be cooked many ways, including frying or toasting over an open flame - but a stack of three in the microwave for a minute come out very nearly as good, and with fewer calories than you might expect. Each package contains about 15 wafers, so the 20-pack is only for large families or the truly fanatical. If you can't get to an Indian grocer, though, consider splitting with some friends. They'd better be good friends, though, because sharing is a real problem.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

review/summary: Indian Pappadums
review/text: I was shocked to find out that I received 20 packages of what looks like about 8 pappadums in a package!  Not what I was expecting!  I usually buy a package of 10 as needed; not 160 pappadums at a time!!!!  The vendor needs to not list the weight, but rather the quantity of pappadums in each package!  Now what do I do with this many pappadums all at once!!!!

review/summary: Read the ingredients label
review/text: I really wanted to like this product.  I am trying to feed my 6 month old baby a variety of foods so he hopefully will not end up a picky eater, but we follow the "4 day wait" rule because my husband & I have some food allergies/sensitivities.  I often cook homemade food but since I work, I appreciate the convenience of organic pre-made food.  Our son had already eaten apples & carrots with no problem.  What I missed in not reading the packaging (my fault - I know) is that in addition to carrots, apples, and parsnips, this product also contains lemon juice.  I happen to be sensitive to all citrus fruits.  Obviously I'm not sure if it was the lemon juice or parsnip or what, but my son was quite sick for 2-3 days after the one time he ate this product.  Blowing out his diaper every hour kind of sick.  We are going to save the remaining containers we had purchased for when my son is a year old and hopefully by then any food sensitivities will have worn off.  He gagged on the taste, though, so we will see.  I gave it two stars instead of one because I plan on trying it again in six months.<br /><br />I personally think that "stage 1" is misleading, because of the lemon juice additive.  I certainly wouldn't give this to a 4 month old.  Although I think most infants don't have a problem with citrus, it is not unheard of in causing digestive distress because of the high acidity.  I also wanted to point out how important it is to read food packaging labels, because even if something implies specific ingredients on the front, there may be additional additives.  I wish Amazon would post the ingredients on here.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE! Read the nutrition label on Ella's website
review/text: This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit-veggie product like this one had so much calcium (20%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, peaches and bananas 10% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

review/summary: Inexplicably a favorite! Worth a try for your little one.
review/text: My daughter has tried nearly all the Ella, Sprout and Happy Baby varieties and this is one of her absolute favorites.  She especially loves it ice cold.  She is 8 mos old with 4 teeth and seems to prefer the texture of the Ellas as well as the stage 2 Sprout meals (not a huge fan yet of the stage 3 much chunkier Sprout meals but like the Happy Tot ones)Today, she was sucking one down on the go in the infant carrier and in trying to avoid getting it all over me, I licked off some extra and man, this has a pretty pronounced parsnip flavor (a little on the radish side but not spicy) carrot is easily tasted.  Not nearly as good as some other flavors I love and she doesnt seem one way or the other about but SHE LOVES IT!!! I wish they sold boxes of it on amazon, which is how I buy the Sprout meals.

review/summary: My favorites of the Tassimo coffees
review/text: I've tried several of the various coffees for Tassimo machines; Gevalia, Henry's, Starbucks, Maxwell House, Carte Noir. The Gevalia Signature Blend is my favorite. I wouldn't consider it a mild coffee, I think it's a bit closer to medium. It has a rich flavor that doesn't come across as being burnt or bitter (like some other coffees do), and is quite smooth. The discs control the temperature and size of the serving, and I find these discs to be quite good in those regards, making a hot cup of coffee that fills a mug to a comfortable level. I've owned my machine for over three years now, and these discs have consistently brewed an excellent cup of coffee. I heartily recommend them.

I do not find the Gevalia Signature Blend bitter at all. In fact I also do not get a bad aftertaste of coffee as I do with others.My husband also enjoys this one and he doesnt get horrible breath afterwards.I really like Gevalia Signature blend so much that I am no longer Looking for an everyday brand this is thee ONE.....

review/text: I like the Signature blend but have noticed the flavor is a bit different now when compaing it to previous purchases.  I added a touch of splenda to sweeten it ever so slightly and it was great.  I made a Red Eye (coffee with a shot of espresso) this morning as I was leaving the house and it tasted good.  I like slightly sweeter coffee but appreciate the opportunity to decide how sweet it needs to be.  I hate nothing more than overly sweet coffee.  I like this but know I need to add a packet or two of splenda to get it just right.

review/text: I purchased the Tassimo machine because it had good reviews and the coffee I had tasted from the Keurig of friends was not to my liking. It tasted very much like the coffee you get from the ubiquitous coffee machines in factory break rooms. Tassimo no longer carries Starbuck's coffee, and it looks as if Gevalia will be its replacement. Not a good choice. I bought the coffee from Amazon because the Tassimo disks are very rare in stores around my area. What taste there is in Gevalia is only a little bit better than the coffee machine dispensers at airports. Perhaps the fault is with Tassimo, which doesn't deliver coffee that is hot enough?

review/text: I tried this coffee primarily because it is much less expensive than other brands of T-Discs I'd been buying.  I was pleasantly surprised that this coffee was bolder than I thought it would be based on the "mild" label.  I've now been buying this coffee for the past 6 months and plan to keep buying it for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good (not great) coffee that's reasonably priced.

review/summary: Very good coffee, brews a perfect cup, not too big as some of Starbucks T-Disks
review/text: I've owned a Tassimo machine for close to a year, and still it makes wonderful coffee, which I enjoy every morning.  Starbucks morning blend has been my favorite, but I always found it brews a large cup, where I love to add milk to my coffee, which always made it too much to enjoy before the coffee got cooler.  But here comes Gevalia to the rescue.  Having ordered one pack to try, I'm really enjoying it!  The Tassimo brewer [which reads the bar code on the t-disk], brews a perfect sized cup, and with milk it's heaven!  Oh, I also love the espresso from Gevalia, it's fantastic.  I used to buy Carte Noir direct from Tassimo, but switched to Gevalia's and amazon, and have not looked back.

review/summary: Exploding T-Discs
review/text: I've been buying the Gevalia Signature Blend T-Discs for a few years and have been getting them from Amazon for most of that time. I also buy other T-Discs and have used them all without incident for all that time. Until last week. We just opened our latest shipment of Gevalia Signature Blend (3-pack) from Amazon and have found the T-Discs to be defective. The foil around the center "port" is not secure all the way around and during brewing, the seal fails and the T-Discs "explode" for lack of a better word. Essentially, the pressure in the T-Disc builds up, the foil seal around the port fails (and rips further) and the pressurized coffee grounds are expelled out of the T-Disc. If the Tassimo is opened at this time, the grounds go EVERYWHERE.<br /><br />After trying a number of these discs and observing the result, trying other discs (Maxwell House) which don't have this issue, and finally dissecting some of the Gevalia Discs that hadn't been through the brewing process, I found the issue being the foil not being sealed sufficiently around the center port. The Lot Number on these discs is J5411054 and have a Best When Used By date of "2012 FEB/FE 18".<br /><br />I've called Tassimo (800 number is on the T-Disc packages) and they are sending replacements. They said this is a rare occurrence.<br /><br />If you have had this same issue, please post here with the Lot Number.<br /><br />I will still continue to order these T-Discs from Amazon, but am taking a break until I have tried the replacement discs from Tassimo. In the meantime, I'll just be using the Maxwell House T-Discs that I also purchase from Amazon.<br /><br />I'm giving this 2 stars for now. Prior to this situation, I would have rated these T-Discs as 4 stars. They would get 5 stars, but I think they're a little overpriced, but my wife prefers these to the Maxwell House.

I thought it must be a new brand, but when I got it home I found out it was manufactured by Hansen's. Hubert Hansen to be specific. That's okay. Hansen's is a good quality brand of drinks. I just had the Classic for lunch. It was good. Not too sour. Not overly sweet either, and only about 70 calories for an 8-ounce glass. The taste was, well what can I say, like classic lemonade. It was quite refreshing and good tasting, but nothing I'd write home about. Would I buy it again? Sure.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My mom bought this drink for me a few weeks ago when down by a convenience store that sold them, and I haven't been able to find them since unfortunately.<br />I saw one negative review so I felt like I needed to state the positive because I absolutely loved this drink.<br />It's 100% natural, no added sugars, and filled with vitamins and caffeine. The most important part I see is that it IS 100% natural. I have not found another no sugar added/juice based energy drink since. All others I usually see on the go contain benzoate or polysorbate or artificial flavors, etc.<br />The orange passionfruit tasted something like orange passionfruit. It tasted sweet and good to me. Maybe the first reviewer had a bad one, didn't have it chilled, (Which can make these drinks taste sort of meh), or it just wasn't palatable to his/her taste buds. I know tons of people either can't stand or love the energy drink "Redbull".<br />Did make me more 'wired' and alert than normal. I usually don't consume energy drinks for the "energy" but rather for the added vitamins/alertness consuming them brings. So it did do its job.<br />Over all I'd give it a 5/5, would buy again. I just wish I could find it in more convenience stores near me now.

review/summary: A little pricey, but...
review/text: These pine nuts are a little bit more expensive than I would prefer, but you get what you pay for.  They are very tasty, they do not exhibit any of the weird tastes that come from Chinese pine nuts, they have a very nice firmness to them, and they go very well in my pesto!

review/summary: Makes great pesto.
review/text: I am falling in love with pesto.  Grew my own basil this year and pureed it and froze it.  Needed pine nuts to make pesto and could not find them locally.  Great price; FAST ship.

review/summary: Great for salad!
review/text: We're trying to eat healthier and heard pine nuts are one of the best nuts for you.  I bought these to put on salads instead of crutons.  They aren't crunchy, but they do add a nice consistency to the salad and I don't feel like it's missing anything.  They have a mild taste and help fill you up.

review/summary: Very delicious
review/text: These guys are delicious. Just make sure you air-tight seal them. They get stale fast and become rock hard. But they taste as good as any name brand gummies at the store.

review/summary: Busting with flavor
review/text: I purchased these to bag up and sell at a bake sale/fundraiser. Needless to say, I of course had to sample them. They were fantastic. Very fresh. They had berry flavor in the blue and red and kind of a marshmallow flavor in the white. They were a hit at the fundraiser. Thanks Albanese, you have great products!

review/summary: good for the price
review/text: 9 bucks for 5 pounds is ridiculous, and they are pretty good.<br /><br />People are saying there is an aftertaste but I'm not getting it.<br /><br />Not the best but not the worst. The red ones flavor is really good and tastes of cherries, the blue ones are meh and sort of flat, and the white ones are pretty good but I have no idea what it is.<br /><br />Consistency is good, and flavor is really good for the price paid.

review/summary: Healthy Jerk
review/text: If you're anything like me and you love jerky, but are reluctant (from a cholesterol perspective) to go to town on a pound of beef jerky, this ahi tuna jerky does the trick.  seasoned well, and much more healthy (unless you're freaked out about mercury as well in which case you should you should throw in the towel and go vegan) then this is great.  Only complaint is how expensive it is by the ounce and some of the pieces are really, REALLY hard.  All in all delish and nutrish.

review/summary: Mostly great but needs better quality control
review/text: When its good, this stuff is wonderful. It's got that delicious fresh (as opposed to canned) tuna edge. I only wish they were more careful about the quality control as sometimes (as noted in other comments), it can be brittle and much too dry.

review/summary: Ahi better than most
review/text: Good texture, good taste on the Ahi tuna. Almost as good as beef jerky.<br /><br />Avoid the salmon jerky. Most of the strips were hard and brittle. Some were so tough they were barely edible...more fit for my dog. Also the salmon was too spicy.

review/summary: Great tasting & healthy jerky!
review/text: Very healthy and great tasting jerky. Tuna is an excellent source of protein and one of the purest and cleanest forms you can get.  The Ahi Tuna Jerkey is made from high quality Tuna and is not something you will find from a beef product. While the Omega 3's helps with heart health and promotes better cardiovascular health.
