review/summary: AWFUL!
review/text: The first thing I noticed when I opened the bag is how thin the cookies were.  Second was the scent, I made a verbal note that they smelled weird.<br /><br />Then I tasted one and thought maybe this taste is because I brushed my teeth. ... NOPE!  They are just awful.<br /><br />I even got a lady at my work to try them and the first thing she said was "they taste like cardboard!"  She told me I should take them back to the store for a refund.  I hate wasting anything so I have resulted to chasing the cookies with a breakfast shake.

review/summary: Not Thrilled
review/text: This product is difficult to use and very messy.  I had high hopes for it.  The taste is difficult to get past - it is VERY salty.  It is a VERY fine powder that is black (roasted/charcoal eggplant) the directions have you wet your toothbrush and place it in the powder then "brush" your teeth and gums with it.  Fist off, I'd not place a toothbrush over and over into a container as this does not seem sanitary - and it blackens everything - brush, teeth, sink etc.... and the powder is fine and seems to get everywhere.  Instead I opted for using a Q-tip to apply the powder - still was very messy.  I can't speak to its medicinal properties as I was unable to get past the mess and taste. I had read positive reviews regarding healing properties - it seems this might be mostly due to the salt.<br /> Here is the write up off of the Eden site itself.<br />EDEN Dentie Toothpowder is a traditional Japanese tooth and gum powder, called 'denshi' in Japan. It was kept in every bathroom cabinet. In the 1960s George Ohsawa (1893 - 1966), the founder of modern macrobiotics, rediscovered Dentie and began recommending it to his students.<br />EDEN Dentie Toothpowder is made in Japan from only the calyx (stem) of Japanese eggplant and sea salt. The eggplant is first cleaned, the calyx and a bit of the vegetable is sliced away, then pickled with sea salt for a few weeks. When finished pickling, the eggplant is dry roasted until it is like charcoal. The charred eggplant is then ground to a fine powder, allowed to cool and packed. EDEN Dentie Toothpowder contains no chemicals, coloring agents, refined sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />Dentie Toothpowder's minerals keep the gums clean and firm, and counter bacteria that may lead to gum problems. Use it once or twice a week to help keep gums and teeth healthy. Simply moisten your fingers or a toothbrush and rub on gums. Leave it on for several minutes and rinse thoroughly. Dentie may also be added to water in a gargle occasionally for a sore throat. It is not recommended for vigorous or everyday brushing as it is abrasive.<br /><br />Please note: Do not use Dentie Toothpowder on open wounds as suggested in some older macrobiotic publications, as it may become embedded under the skin causing a bluish scar.

review/summary: My Favorite Brand of Flour
review/text: Over 28 years, I have baked with many different flours.  Pillsbury, Gold Medal, King Arthur, Bob's Red Mill and of late, an organic brand that I bought at Costco. Hands down, Bob's is my favorite!  It seems like it takes less flour (for yeast doughs) and I get consistently good results.  I also like their bags.  Now, that sounds crazy, but how many times have you picked up a traditional "flapped" flour bag and it's opened or leaks a bit?  Bobs packaging is superior in that it's heavy-duty and very secure. No way the flour can become contaminated in transit or while at the store.  It's also very easy to open up.

review/summary: Delicious instant noodles
review/text: I picked one of these up at a oriental store to try it and it was delicious but mine may be different. It says Pho Bo Beef. The product description on Amazon is a little lacking so I'm not sure.<br /><br />There were 5 different packets to go with the rice noodles: Dehydrated herbs/veggies, Regular Seasoning, Beef Packet (actual chunks of beef, packet reminded me of an MRE), Hoisen Sauce, and some kind of chili sauce.<br /><br />This is a far more substantial meal than what you normally get from an instant noodle. You have to add hot water and microwave it so it takes slightly longer but it's well worth it. I highly recommend and I would like to try other flavors.

review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act "stoned" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for "marinating" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a "harmless, euphoric state" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten.

review/text: My cats will only get their buzz from Cosmic, even cat toys stuffed with catnip doesnt work with them. But I was becoming concerned when the last container I purchased thru Amazon had 2 ladybugs (dried and preserved) floating amidst the catnip. I have nothing against lady bugs, the idea of quality control concerned me. So I'm keeping an eye on this large container and hoping it was just a fluke last time.

review/summary: This is very fragrant, and loved by my kitties
review/text: I'm a cat lover, and spoil them very often. Recently we tried several local stores for catnip and none were very fragrant or very loved by my cats. The older Cosmic Catnip size was no longer for sale, and had lasted a while. After about a year of trying to get decent catnip locally, I came back to Amazon. Read the reviews, and came back to Cosmic catnip (now in a slightly larger size container).<br /><br />This stuff is great, my cats respond to it well, and they love it. The biggest problem is they have really been using the cat scratcher we put the catnip on much more than usual and have had to order a refill kit.<br /><br />If you want very good catnip at a very reasonable price, this may be a good choice.

review/summary: The cats prefer Kong but this will do
review/text: I have gone through several <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018N1DRW">KONG Naturals Premium Catnip, 2-Ounce</a> jars.  Looking for a bit more value, I decided to try Cosmic Catnip.  I don't typically like to change a good thing but went with it. I have house cats and also care for some free-roaming cats. Both populations react favorably to the product. For the house cats, I sprinkle some in their cat beds and on their toys and they roll around, sometimes head over heels. It is quite amusing to watch. However, I think the cats are more interested in the Kong product; they seem to spend greater periods of time playing with it and sniffing it.  In my house, that means more exercise and that is something I like to promote.<br /><br />Cosmic's catnip is packaged in a #3 plastic container, which is not as easily recyclable as a #1 or #2 plastic in most areas. The product's packaging also indicates that it is grown in North America, so that may mean outside of the United States. (For the record, Kong's catnip comes in a #1 PETE container that is easily recyclable and its catnip is also grown in North America).<br /><br />Would I purchase it again?  My cats like it but there is no reason to use a container that is only sometimes recyclable for catnip.  Additionally, my cats liked the Kong product a bit more.  I will likely stick with that when it is time to repurchase.

review/summary: I never argue with Princess Pia!
review/text: I bought this for my feline friend, Princess Pia. Actually I am taking liberties in calling her my friend.  I'm really her servant.  She loves it, and recommends it to all minions who work for cats.  Who am I to argue with her seal of approval?<br /><br />It's good stuff, according to her, and she reminds me that she has exquisite taste in catnip, among other things.  Your cats will probably love it, too.

review/summary: Great nip
review/text: Every year I buy a container of Cosmic Catnip to make a few "tube-sock" type toys with for my cats (currently 8 and 9 years- Female and male respectively) for Christmas. Even with the toy downstairs and wrapped in some thick wrapping paper, the cats go directly to their toy and try to claw off the paper to start playing with it. The toy entices them for about a week, which afterwards the smell of the catnip starts to vanish. If I accidently leave the lid of the container off, I'll find the jar tipped over and two kitties eating up the leaves and rolling their faces in it.<br /><br />The only down side of this nip, being sold in such bulk and so pure, is it has "stem-like" pieces in the container, which can poke through fabric when making toys for the cats. I try to pull out all the stems before filling the toys up with the nip or letting the cats nibble on the product raw. The cats don't seem to mind, however, and there have never been any incidents where the stem gets stuck in their mouth (you know, like when we eat popcorn and the kernel always gets jammed in our mouths).<br /><br />Bottom line: Some powerful nip, the most potent of any nip I've ever bought and will continue to buy it every year.

review/summary: Not The Same as Store bought??
review/text: Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!

review/summary: Cats loved it - Eight Paws up!
review/text: Only reason I give it 4 stars is because someone was right, there are ALOT of hard stems/sticks in this product but maybe I just have been buying catnip without stems in it for a while.  Maybe this means it is fresh and all natural too.  I saw lots of buds which was good.  I removed as many sticks/stems as I could and gave it to my cats.  They seemed to really like it alot.  They didn't go crazy nutty cuckoo but who knows, maybe tomorrow they will!  I bought it mainly for their digestion and it seemed to calm them and relax them which I liked.  I noticed a little bit later one of them was up on the table trying to get in the jar which I thought was cute.  They give it eight paws up!  (because there are two of them, four paws each).

review/summary: Cosmic Catnip is the Best!
review/text: I have been looking for this brand of kitty nip for over 10yrs. I bought this brand long time ago & my kitties were in heaven. This is a safe product for your pet, I trust it completely. I give it a rating of 100+. My pet is picky & when the package showed up & I opened the box, put the jar on the floor my kitty was all over the jar trying to open it up, it was hilarious. He new it was his. If you wanted to buy just a 1/2oz 10yrs ago you paid $10.00 for it. When I saw the price of this 4oz jar I was flabbergasted, I just had to snap it up in a heartbeat while I could still could find this brand. It is very hard to find it in the stores now days (go figure something that's good for the pet)I'm the cats-meow in my pets eye now! It's like a kitty Valium in green form,lol. So look no farther you have found the BEST & SAFEST product for your pet right here and the price is out of this world (inexpensive). Believe me the other catnip on the market today is bunk junk & will cause health problems for your pet, Cosmic Catnip will not cause health problems, I know because the other stuff almost killed my pet.<br />http://www.amazon.com/B005CGUUJS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CGUUJS">Cosmic Catnip Jar, 4-Ounce</a>

review/summary: A good substitute, Chebe is better though
review/text: This is very easy to mix up, and the taste is plain pizza dough. Have some gluten-free flour of some sort on hand (or use some extra of this mix), this is a very sticky dough starting out. I'd recommend a liberal brushing with some garlic olive oil before adding toppings (just mince some garlic and mix it into a cup of olive oil), otherwise the crust can get pretty hard on the edges.<br /><br />For someone who loves pizza, but can't have wheat or gluten, this is the best thing out there.<br /><br />EDIT: We've since discovered the Chebe products, which are much more like bread. The pizza crust is excellent, not sticky like Orgran and available on Amazon.

review/text: This is a staple for our gluten free household.  It is quick, easy, requires no additional ingredients other than water (may or may not add package of yeast).  It makes a good pizza crust, is easy to handle without being too fragile.  And believe it or not the crust actually browns on the bottom.  Which is great for a gluten free pizza.  Cooks well on a pizza stone, heavy mini pizza pans, or classic stainless steel pizza pans.  It is a big hit with my school age daughters friends who cannot tell it is gluten free.

I tried one and only got through 5 or 6 chews before I had to spit it out.<br /><br />I got them as a stocking stuffer for Xmas and it was fun receiving them and I was excited to try them as I like trying unusual foods, etc. It was also fun getting my fiance to try one, knowing how gross they were and knowing that he had an even lower tolerance for gross tastes, hahah. After that I threw the rest out because I knew no one would eat them.<br /><br />So I agree with the previous reviewers who say this is great for a gag gift, but bad if you are seriously looking to buy for gum to chew.

review/summary: "gag" gift or no?
review/text: They aren't as spicy as I was expecting. It is VERY clearly a wasabi flavor, but without the sinus-clearing effect. The sweet back-taste is disconcerting in a way...very out-of-place and doesn't especially go well with the wasabi. As you chew, there are spicy flare-ups, but nothing like I expected. Had to spit it out because of the sweet, not the spice.<br /><br />Side note: the tin claims "22 pieces", mine only had 19. not sure if that was just an anomaly or not, but in looking in the tin, I'm not entirely sure 22 would even fit.

review/text: I'm having trouble finding Reese's Pieces in grocery stores these days.  They used to be popular, but ever since the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup obsession came out with its many sizes and varities (especially during the holiday season) the Reese's Pieces have either been pushed to the side, or even worse, sort of gone out of style.  An outrage?  Not quite, just disappointing.  An outrage is that I can't find Mars Bars anymore when I distinctly remember finding thse bars very easily 15 years ago.  Anyway, please pick up a bag of Reese's Pieces IF you can find them for less than 4 bucks.  11 bucks sold here on amazon is, yes, an outrage.  Factor in shipping and handling and... no.  Not worth it.  What a delicious tasty treat these things are though.  I have such a craving for these bite-sized, flavorful tasties and yet I can't satisfy it because I can't find them in stores!

With the other brands the taste seemed to drop flat, there was something wanting or missing.  Fifty/50 finishes like real chocolate, melting in your mouth and filling it with the sweet chocolate flavor.  I let my wife try it and she found it hard to believe that it was sugar free.

review/summary: Good taste, good nutrition, low calories (even with some sugar!)
review/text: A few days ago I stumbled across this outstanding cereal while browsing our local grocery chain's web site for healthy lo-cal foods. Its has far fewer calories than the raisin bran I normally eat when I do cereal, and is even lower calorie and higher in fiber than the Shredded Wheat my wife eats. It also has 45% of your daily iron, and nice percentages (in the 25% to 35% range) of other necessary vitamins.<br /><br />It also has a very good taste, you could eat a few pieces of it at a time for a snack. A 3/4 cup serving has 7 grams of sugar. Since it is still lower calorie than what I've been eating, that doesn't concern me.<br /><br />With 1/3rd cup of milk and a half of a banana, breakfast is less than 200 calories and very nutritious. I use a bit less milk than many on cereal. I don't like it to ever get soggy, yet I don't like it completely dry. I have developed the knack of pouring just enough so that the milk doesn't show in the cereal. If I can see the milk after I pour (cereal already in the bowl LOL), I know I've overdone it for my taste.<br /><br />If you are watching calories, beware of the other flavor varieties of this cereal line. They are almost twice the calories per serving (200 or so compared to the 110 for this).<br /><br />I do find that 3/4 cup of this cereal with a half banana is just as filling for me as a cup of Raisin Bran (with a half banana), so I'm getting more nutrition, more fiber, and about 80 fewer calories for a bowl of cereal. I have always had trouble getting enough fiber in my diet, so the extra provided here is very helpful.<br /><br />The Amazon price is considerably less than our local supermarket, which has this at about $4 a box.

review/summary: What fiber cheerios would taste like (if there were such a thing)
review/text: Having tried just about every fiber-branded cereal there is over the past couple of years, I would always pass by the Cheerios in the cereal section while grocery shopping and look to see if they had released a fiber version yet. Well, I can now happily report that my search for a consistently good-tasting fiber cereal are over. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of other competitor's products out there that are really good (Fiber One Shredded Wheat, for instance) but if you're a normal person, you will probably get sick of eating the same thing for breakfast in a matter of weeks or months. This cereal on the other hand, tastes great and never seems to get boring. It's lightly sweetened- just perfect as it isn't overly sweet or bland in flavor. It is pretty filling as most fiber cereals are, and is best enjoyed immediately after being immersed in milk so you can still enjoy the crunchiness of it(meaning it will get somewhat soggy if left sitting around for too long). I'm tempted to knock a star off for pricing as this is somewhat pricier and smaller-sized than competitors' offerings, but for how good the cereal tastes and the fact that I can't seem to get tired of eating it (going on 5 months now), I'd say its worth it to pay the small premium.

review/summary: Delicious and low carb
review/text: Fiber Plus Cinnamon is very tasty; sweet enough to not need anything else.  As a diabetic, I appreciate Kellogg's making a cereal that tastes good, has high fiber, and is low carb (overall, when you consider the fiber content). The other Fiber Plus flavored cereals all have over 45 carbs per serving.  At 26 carbs per serving and 9 g of fiber, Fiber Plus Cinnamon is great!  Also, cinnamon supports good blood sugar control.  Win win.

review/summary: Tastes almost too good....
review/text: I was looking for a couple items to add some fiber into my new diet.  This was one of the cereals that I bought.  Obviously we all have different tastes and like different textures......but Holy Moly does this taste good to me.  Darn near too good.  I love cinnamon and have liked the taste of apple cinnamon cheerios.  This is without the apple, but the cinnamon is on blast.  I almost wish they would cut the sugar from 7 grams down to 3 grams and make it even better for you.<br /><br />One person mentioned texture.  I found the texture to be like cinnamon toast.  I didn't notice 'gritty'.  Gritty implies something unatural, where as this just seems to have the right crunch.  Don't let it sit in the milk to long or it will get soggy like any of the O's .<br /><br />I've actually did a 50/50 mix with cherrios to lower the sweetness and calories/sugar a bit.  I eat 2 servings to make one bowl.  I think this would be a good snack too.  Alot better than crackers.  And maybe better as a snack then a breakfast, because it's taste too darn good.<br /><br />I wish they made a bigger box so one can get a better price.<br /><br />I give it a full and complete 4 stars and recommend you try it.

review/summary: Crunchy, cinnamon sweet and good for you
review/text: If you're looking for a delicious cereal that is also good for you - look no further. The cinnamon oat crunch is far better than the Cheerios branch, with a better texture, flavor, and more fiber content. If you enjoy sweeter cereals and cinnamon (think cinnamon toast crunch) this is a healthier alternative that tastes equally as good. I enjoy mine with a healthy dose of Silk soy milk.

review/text: I just recently started a diet and wanted to up my fiber intake, I had been eating those fiber granola bars but they were so loaded with sodium or sugars that I felt I was losing the battle either way. Then I found the Fiber Plus brand and tried the Cinnamon Oat Crunch Cereal... YUM! I am a fan of anything cinnamon so they had me at that, but the cereal is great as a snack and I just recently tried it with milk and it was delicious! My Picky father who hates anything considered healthy tried some and loved it too! Now if only I could get him to like Whole Grain Pasta...

review/text: I've finally found the best cereal in the world! Absolutely love it! Saw it at Costco about a year ago and bought a box to try it out; I bought it primarily because it had high fiber and high percentages of vitamins and minerals. The taste is fabulous...slightly sweet with a cinnamon finish. It also doesn't get soggy too quickly. Every day right after I arrive at work I plow through three or four bowls along with a handful of nuts and fresh berries. And man does this stuff make you regular! Within minutes after finishing my last bowl I almost always have a Code Blue situation necessitating a sprint down the hallway to the bathroom to lay some massive cable! Buy it man!!

review/text: I tried this cereal out when I saw it at Costco. I really like it for the fiber content and flavor. It tastes like Cheerios with cinnamon and sugar. It is definitely more dense and much more filling though and I am guessing that is the extra fiber. It has 35% of the daily recommended fiber. I was disappointed though when Costco stopped selling it. Very excited to find it here at Amazon and an even better price than Costco.

review/summary: High Fiber - Really Good Cinnamon Cereal
review/text: I decided to try The Fiber Plus Cinnamon Oats Crunch Cereal, since I was looking for a high fiber good-tasting cereal.  Usually, I stay away from this flavor cereal, as I am not particularly fond of cinnamon for breakfast.  However, I did give this one a try due to the whole grain high fiber content, and was very much surprised at how good it is.  The oats are very crunchy and sweet, and are good eaten alone or with milk.  It does have 7 grams of sugar, which makes it sweet, but I will buy this cereal from now on just for the high fiber content of 9 grams per serving.  With 110 calories per serving without milk, the sweet, crunchy taste is a plus for me.  Considering the naturally flavored cinnamon whole grain, the price is very reasonable for what you get.

Fiber Plus Cinnamon Oats Crunch is delicious along with having kid-cereal appeal. It's sweet, light, crunchy, along with a potent cinnamon flavor, which I like a lot. I have to be careful though, because they're good enough to slide a small handful into your mouth as a snack. Too much of anything is not a good thing, but they seem to satisfy my sweet tooth. Good stuff!

review/summary: Awful in milk, but not bad as a snack.
review/text: I had planned to give this cereal 1 star after eating it in milk because I could barely force myself to eat the whole bowl, but then when I tried it as a snack (without milk), it was good enough that I decided to up the rating to 2 stars.<br /><br />Similar to Kellogg's Krave Chocolate cereal, which I also reviewed, this FiberPlus has a texture problem.  When it milk, I found it so grainy as to be off-putting.  As a snack, there is a nasty aftertaste that I presume to be from the addition of antioxidants.  I don't remember the aftertaste so much in milk.  The cinnamon taste is more pronounced as a snack than as a cereal.<br /><br />For those who are interested in the nutrition information, here are the stats for a 3/4 cup serving:<br /><br />Calories  110<br />Total fat  1.5g<br />Sat/trans fat  0<br />Poly unsat  0.5g<br />Mono unsat  0<br />Sodium  140mg<br />Total carbs  26g<br />Fiber  9g (5g soluble and 4g insoluble)<br />Sugars  7g<br />Protein  3g<br />Vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, B12, C, D and E and several minerals.<br /><br />In summary, I do not recommend this cereal unless getting a lot of fiber in your diet is more important to you than taste.

review/summary: Bowel Movements The Size of Small Children!
review/text: Like most people in their twilight years, I sometimes have trouble with my bowel movements. Some weeks I'll go five to six days without nary a poot and others it's like someone lined my colon with Crisco. Looking for a delicious cereal that would assist me in my problem, I chose to give Fiber Plus Cinnamon Oats Crunch a try. I'll be the first to admit, I do not like cinnamon. Its flavor makes the back of my throat ache like getting elbowed in the ear repeatedly. And while that has only happened once in my life, once was enough! It was the summer of 1942 and I was a young lad with a paper route in Terre Haute, Indiana. One day, for whatever reason that escapes me at this time, the newspapers were late getting out. Could have been a war, could have been I overslept. That ancedote isn't important at this juncture. But I was delivering the papers roughly 20-25 minutes late that day. Didn't seem like that big of a deal to me at the time as I was young and ruthless. However, Old Man Sanderson didn't see it my way. He came barreling out his front door with the deft agility of a gazelle, yelling "WHY IS MY PAPER SO LATE?!?!" I must admit, this startled me somewhat so I hurriedly tossed the paper in his direction and made the conscious decision to keep pedaling. Unfortunately, Old Man Sanderson had other plans. Using a shoulder tackle that would make football players shudder, he knocked me off my bicycle and into the gutter. I squealed in pain as he kept using his elbow repeatedly to knock my eardrum loose. Finally, the neighbors came out to see what the commotion was and one of them (I have no idea who as my eyes were filled with blood at this point) shot Old Man Sanderson dead in his tracks. My ear hurt for days after that.<br /><br />Anyway, this cereal really gives me slippery bowel movements which I am happy for because rugged bowel movements can really screw up an old man's day.

review/summary: Tastes bland
review/text: I was tired of buying the same cereal for months (Chex Cinnamon, whichever Kashi was on sale, and whichever Honey Bunches of Oats were on sale), so I was looking for a new cereal product to try. Seeing as how other reviewers loved this cereal, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />When the cereal arrived, I was excited to give it a taste. I poured myself a bowl of fat free milk and got seated at the table. The cheerios-looking bits certainly looked very good, so I happily took a big spoonful of milk and cereal and delightfully took my first bite. Strangely, I could not taste the cinnamon. On top of that, the cereal left a very unsatisfying aftertaste (was this due to the antioxidants or the fiber?). I struggled to finish my cereal bowl, only managing to finish the bowl by reminding myself of the nutritional value it provided.<br /><br />I would give this cereal a 1-star rating, but considering it does contain a whole lot of fiber, I am bumping this to a 2. Now I am left with the challenge of finishing this box along with 2 others that I have bought. On the plus side, the boxes are smaller than the average Kellogg's/Post cereal found in stores, so I hope I can finish them faster.<br /><br />Edit: Okay, so I'm almost done with the first box with the help of my roommates. They tried it out and said it tasted fine. Then they tried it with milk and said the milk kind of "washed" away the taste. The only way I was able to enjoy this cereal with milk was by mixing it with some Kix that I had bought earlier.<br /><br />Edit 2: Done with all 3 boxes. I edited the titled to say that it tasted bland rather than just straight up bad. It's actually not bad at all; it tastes exactly as flavored - Cinnamon Oats. I'm not a big fan of oats, only eating it for its nutritional value, so I wasn't a big fan of this cereal.

review/summary: Fabulous, on-the-go meal
review/text: I've never written a review before (I think my husband may have done so once or twice under my name, but I think I caught and erased those : ) ), but I had to write one for this product (this review would apply equally to the salami and turkey stick goPicnic product which, along with the peanut butter one, are our favorites).  When we go on family trips (with two small kids), we have three major expenses - transportation, housing, and food.  When we stay in one hotel for the entire trip, it is easy enough to bring bread and other sandwich parts, and store them in the mini-(or not-so-mini) fridge.  But there are times when that is not practical, such as when we were taking a two week car trip around the Southwest U.S.  Having an organic, reasonably healthy, fairly tasty meal option that was shelf stable and could just be carried in our vehicle's hatchback area until being thrown into backpacks for walks in the heat of the day for a later lunch, was a wonderful luxury.  All that said, I wouldn't do that if we had kept them in an un-AC'd trunk in a sedan, because the contents can melt if they get hot enough (we found out about that when we left them in our car in the sun in the summer for longer than we had intended).<br />  But, they have come in handy for more than trips.  One of my children attended an outdoor camp for one week this summer, for which she had to bring lunch each day.  I knew that even if I'd given her a cooler with ice packs in which to store her lunch, anything I gave her during those 98 degree days would potentially have spoiled.  I was not as concerned with a GoPicnic.<br />  Unlike some of the other goPicnic box types, which might have something spicy in it, the items in this peanut butter one were gobbled up in their entirety by my kids.  I have had a couple, too, and I have no complaints about the taste of or ingredients in the crackers, peanut butter, applesauce, or gummies.  The peanut butter is hard to open for little kids, though.<br />  Also, although we have comparison shopped with a few stores on price, including Target, the subscribe option on Amazon makes Amazon the cheapest choice.<br />  Bottom line, this product isn't healthy enough to be an everyday meal choice.  You can make healthier, portable options using fresh ingredients.  But, for certain situations, usually ones dealing with an absence of refrigeration in a relatively hot climate, when you have picky eaters for whom an organic meal replacement bar isn't going to work, this product cannot be beat.

All the meals we've tried have had a very good taste, and the portioning is pretty perfect--by the time you feel "done" with one item, it's gone.<br /><br />Edited to add that one or more products in the pack contains gelatin and isn't 100% vegetarian.

Kids will especially like this GoPicnic ready-to-eat meal that has crisp crackers, natural peanut butter, applesauce, cheddar bunny crackers and gummy bears. It is the perfect size for kids or would work well as a snack for adults. You will also appreciate that the ingredients in the foods in this box are all-natural. The foods are free of artificial colors or flavors. Like the gummy bears are colored with black carrot juice. They taste absolutely delicious you'd never know. The cheddar bunnies are made with organic wheat and the applesauce is unsweetened but still very tasty. There is also no MSG.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Simple and tasty
review/text: I buy these to put in my son's lunchbox on days when I don't have time to make his lunch, so he has eaten this about once every two weeks for the past several months.  He likes them a lot.  I like that they are a mostly well balanced lunch with nutritious ingredients and a very reasonable calorie count.  They do contain two different kinds of crackers, and I would prefer that they put something different in besides one type of crackers.  As it is, my son doesn't eat one of the packages of crackers, and I supplement this lunch with some kind of vegetable (celery sticks or carrot sticks) to give a slightly better balance.<br /><br />That is really my only criticism, I guess.  They are incredibly convenient, and I like that the ingredients and products they contain are basically healthful.  They also taste good, and all the little packages of things seem to be very fun for children.

review/text: Go picnic by the box is a horrible item!  It is expensive, not a balanced meal as stated, and is full of carbs.  Definitely not worth ordering.  I only ordered once and they send it to me monthly, can't return can't seem to stop the orders.  They never stated it was an automatic  monthly shipment or that it was non return.  What a hassle and disappointment of amazon.  I'll think twice before using amazon shopping again!  And good luck with customer service!  Go picnic products ugh!

review/text: Dog actually pawed at the bag trying to get at this Eagle Pack chow when it arrived.  Gobbles it up without hesitation. The dog is robust, healthy and happy on this highly nutritious chow.<br /><br />Every now and then we pre-soak the chow with a little chicken broth for a special treat he just loves.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Very, very satisfied
review/text: While I haven't tried 'every' raw cacao powder on the market (who could?), I've tried many, some of which were of good quality and others not so.<br /><br />The Organic Nectars Premium Raw Cacao Powder is the best I've tried yet and I'm very pleased with it.  It has a very fine consistency that mixes extremely well with hot water and just a bit of stirring.  The taste is quite chocolate-y and smooth, being both clean-tasting and rich, to paraphrase another pleased reviewer.  I generally throw in just a touch of chile pepper, cinnamon and a natural sweetener and the result is a delicious drink that gives me all that I expect from a quality raw cacao powder.<br /><br />"Two thumbs up!" is obviously my assessment of this product.  If you enjoy true cacao powder and are looking for a premium product and taste, I say give the Organic Nectars powder a try.  Based upon my experience, my strong bet is that you will like it as much as I do.

review/summary: High fiber, reasonable calories, great taste
review/text: Have been on a high-fiber diet for several years now, so I read nutrition labels carefully.  Never expected to actually like gumbo, but I did, very much.  When all my local stores quit carrying, I ordered from Amazon.com. Shipment arrived promptly (even using super saver shipping) and in fine condition.  Not a soup I eat every day, but a fine addition to my high-fiber diet.

review/summary: Could be a lot better.
review/text: I just came back from Mardi Gras and had Gumbo/Jambalaya and all the other great food. I was sure this wasn't going to be that good but it tasted fine. The biggest problem I have is the picture that shows big chunks of okra, vegetables and sausage. There were only two chunks of any kind of vegetables in there one tomato and one celery. No Okra at all, and only one small piece of sausage and a few strands of meat of any kind. I don't know if that's what it takes to make it healthier (cheaper to produce). It probably wouldn't be too bad if you added more rice (small amount compared to New Orleans version I had) and your own sausage pieces, okra and misc. vegetables. It isn't bad tasting just disappointing "presentation" vs. what you receive. It is a base basically not a stew or soup.

review/summary: one of the best HC soup flavors!
review/text: I am really picky about HC soups, but this one is one of the better ones! You do have to add a little bit of flavoring, I add a pinch of garlic salt, and some Kraft fat free cheese sprinkles. The soup itself is only 200 calories, and super filling!  I will buy again. For a healthy choice brand soup, it's one of the better ones!

review/text: I generally like or love Healthy Choice products and appreciate their wholistic food approach.  But this gumbo is truly mediocre.  Problems go on and on.  Healthy Choice products frequently take several tastes to fully appreciate the healthiness and taste (there certainly are more tasty products than any Healthy Choice product I've tried).  But after tasting a full dozen of these, I still regret its purchase.

review/summary: A Healthier Gumbo
review/text: I absolutely love a nice, hot steaming bowl of soup once in awhile. Fortunately, Healthy Choice makes a nice arrangement of taste and quality with their soups. Their Zesty Gumbo soup however, isn't one of their best flavors. While the soup does blend in a unique blend of chicken, rice celery and flavor, there unfortunately lacks a bit of spice in the flavor by not adding enough garlic or zest from onions or cheese to the taste of the tongue. On top of that, it also lacks by not adding enough sausage in the gumbo, unlike Cambell's Chunky or Progresso's Chicken & Sausage Gumbo. It isn't a bad soup for the price if you're health-smart, but at least it is better than Cambell's putting sea salt in their lower sodium soups. I just hope that there is an improved formula in this gumbo.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Taste: C+<br /><br />Overall: C+

review/summary: Cans arrived dented and unsuable
review/text: I do like the taste of this soup as I have purchased this in the past at the grocery store. I haven't been able to find it so when I saw this offered on Amazon I ordered several cases. To my disappointment all but 3 of the cans were severly dented and one was actually leaking. Amazon immediately sent replacements but sadly they arrived in the same condition. I'm not sure if this problem originated in the warehouse or was the result of poor packaging and shipping. The only reason I gave this one star is because of the superior customer service I received from Amazon. I will try this item again at a later date to see if they have corrected the problem.

review/summary: OLD??? HARD AS A ROCK!!!
review/text: I have been buying Sweet Potato and Yam treats for my 3 dogs for the past year or two. My dogs love them so we make sure we always have a good supply on hand. I purchased these particular treats from this particular supplier because the price was a bit less than usual. However, they are so HARD that even my big dog has a hard time chewing them!! And my older small dog will not even try to chew them, though they are his favorite treat. This is the second time I ordered this product from this supplier and both orders were the same, the treats are too hard for the dogs to chew!! I ordered a second time hoping I just got a bad batch from them or something. However, both orders were the same, too hard for the dogs to chew!! I don't know if they have been allowed to sit around and get old and hard, or what. All I do know for sure is that I will not be ordering any more items from this supplier!! It's not cheap if you have to throw it away in the end!!

review/text: I just wanted to say that if you want to get your dog a healthy snack alternative, this product would be a good one; if the vendor did not ship you old, outdated, dried out and hard crap.  Very disappointed.  Luckily, I found a store that is close to me that carries this item that is fresh.  I would NOT recommend this vendor to anyone.
