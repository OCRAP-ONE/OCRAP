review/summary: A Perfect Coffee Blend, Our Favorite
review/text: If a milder, smoother taste is what you are looking for, you won't find anything better than Green Mountain Nantucket Blend. This is the first coffee I ever tried in my Keurig and it's been a staple in our variety of K-Cups for two years now. The quality is superb - I wouldn't expect anything less from Green Mountain. In fact, a friend who has a relative who works there says the quality control is so strict they throw out cups that have even a tish more or less coffee than the cups are supposed to. At less than 0.60 cents/cup, this is a bargain. With Prime Membership, to have these delivered to my door is too good to be true.

review/summary: Is this really pasta?
review/text: When I bought this pasta, I went by its cover as it looks good and its Made in Italy...well they say never judge a book by its cover...unfortunately since I had never tried this pasta, I had no choice but to go by its cover.<br /><br />The pasta itself was completely tasteless, not sure what I was eating where I couldn't taste any lemon or pepper flavor. Moreover, the pasta when cooked broke in tiny pieces and was not possible to get it cooked Al-dente.<br /><br />I now have 5 boxes left and  most likely will distribute them among my friends (yes, I will inform them they should taste it at their own risk) so please ignore this brand and this pasta to save your money.

review/text: I was fortunate to receive a gift of Mantova Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from one of my customers for Christmas last year.  Truly one of the best I've used,  without the odd aftertaste that accompanies so many inferior brands.  Couldn't even talk myself into finishing a newly opened bottle of Brand X, which I dumped in favor of the far more flavorful Mantova.

It gives me a nice afternoon pick-me-up and I love the fruity taste.  The drink is augmented with ginseng, guarana, B vitamins, and other good stuff.  While it's probably not the healthiest drink on the market, I love the taste.  I'm one of those people who can't drink water and need to find other sources for hydration especially since I live in Florida where it's very hot.  Rockstar and Blackberry Ice are my drinks of choice.

review/summary: Zero Carb = BEST
review/text: As I work nights, I've tried almost EVERY energy drink out there. They usually taste like vitamin-y candy.<br />This is the best (besides Juiced Guava... Less calories. When you drink 2 a night, that adds up).<br />As I sit here, sipping the lovely purple liquid, I contemplate how to describe the flavor. Sweet, hint of fruity? I dunno, but it's VERY enjoyable. I visit 7-11 nightly, was all bummed out because they were out. Got Monster instead and whined at my 7-11 guy. He told me to put the Moster back and went and grabbed me some from his stash in the back. What a winner!! :-)<br />I like RockStar Zero Carb (blue can) WAY more than Redbull or Bawls. Though I do enjoy Monster's HitMan energy shots, though too much caffiene too fast. Prefer to slowly consume throughout my shift....<br />Hope this helps someone.

review/summary: The king of energy drinks!
review/text: I started drinking Monsters in high school, usually one or more a day. I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured "wild berry" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more "energy" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version.

I found it cheaper to do this so I bought a couple 24 packs. These did not last long between the two of us. They taste wonderful but are a lot of caffeine. If you don't drink it normally Id NOT suggest these! My friend tried one and could not finish it. She felt sick the entire rest of the day because she never drinks caffeine. I routinely drink it and have since I was young. These cans are wonderful for me to take in my lunch to college classes and help me keep up between class, clinical, working and homework! Plus 20 calories for a whole can? Who can beat that?

But the blueberry flavor (blue and white can) is 100x better.<br /><br />If you want a sugar free energy drink, get the diet Red Bulls. I can hardly taste the difference with those. But these are okay sometimes and WAY cheaper.

review/text: I am the type of person who needs a caffeine rush in the morning in order to make it through the day. Unfortunately, I can't stand the taste of coffee.<br /><br />When energy drinks entered the market, I tried them out but couldn't stand the taste of all the sugar. Once Rockstar released a sugar free energy drink, I was hooked from the start. It doesn't have a flat taste like all other sugar free drinks do, this one will give you a pop when you take your first swig.<br /><br />Price is pretty completive, though you can find them cheaper if you hunt around. Some convenience stores will sell them  2 for $3, making them a better deal. But you have to drive around and find a place that has them on sale, so I think paying the extra 20 cents or so on here is worth it.

review/text: I picked up a can of the sugar free Rock Star today. I was dying of thirst so when I opened it, I took a big chug of it. About halfway through swallowing it, the taste hit me, and I wanted to spit it all back out right away!<br /><br />WHAT! THE! What *is* that disgusting taste? It was like chewing a big wad of Hubba Bubba, then drinking some nasty strawberry soda mixed with Code Red Mountain Dew and a baby aspirin all at once. After the first drink, I was still thirsty so I braved another swallow and I ended up just opening the car door and dumping the whole can out right then and there. It made me GAG trying to choke this hideous concoction down! What a waste of money.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of energy drinks to begin with, but I've never !!IN MY LIFE!! tasted one this gross. It even smelled like CAT PEE.

review/summary: It's about the caffeine!
review/text: 240 MG of caffeine, no sugar crash, no calories to fill you up.<br /><br />Not sure why people say it tastes bad or perhaps it's my brain telling my taste buds that it doesn't matter.<br /><br />As for the price, two cups of gas station coffee (well, maybe truck stop coffee...) or one small cup of Starbucks coffee will give you the same jolt for about the same price.  Take your pick.<br /><br />Besides, do we really drink these things for the taste?

review/summary: By far the best energy drink!
review/text: I have tried a number of energy drinks in my day, and Rockstar's Low Carb is the best. Low calories, tasty, no "fake sugar" aftertaste, and a nice boost. $44 for 24 cans with free shipping is pretty good here on Amazon (approximately $1.83 a can), but I prefer to get it on sale at Target in 4 packs for $6 ($1.50 per can). The only downside is that it's hard to find sometimes!

review/summary: Doesn't taste like toothpaste or cough syrup. All right.
review/text: By the grace of God, unlike Monster or almost any energy drink (including those horrifyingly disgusting and extraordinarily expensive shots of caffeine which carry the not-so-happy side-effect of making you get hot flashes and flush like it's a freaking rash on your face), this actually tastes palatable. In my experience of tasting energy drinks and shots, they almost invariably taste exactly like toothpaste and/or cough syrup. Not only are they disgusting beyond words and are insanely unpleasant to drink for seemingly no good reason, but they almost always have very little of the single ingredient that matters: Caffeine. Any half-educated energy drink consumer knows this is the only ingredient in the entire thing that actually does anything at all. There's 240mg per can in these, versus the usual 120mg (about the same amount of a standard cup of coffee) in other drinks of the same size, which is just not enough for people like me.<br /><br />This stuff actually tastes like a genuine raspberry soda, has a decent kick, and doesn't taste as horrible as anything Monster has ever made or any of the even more unpleasant energy shots that taste identical to concentrated cough syrup, which then, for seemingly almost everyone, give you a blast of Niacin so insanely high that it even warns you of it ahead of time, and by God, if it lasted more than a few minutes, you'd think you'd need an ambulance. And you pay a *lot* for those suckers.<br /><br />This is really the way to go. It tastes good and has a lot of caffeine, and lacks the bad things most energy drinks have. Since that's really all that matters, I highly recommend it. It never seems to get old.

review/summary: Good, and Bad
review/text: Before I largely stopped drinking energy drinks, these were two of the products i drank a lot of.<br /><br />Overall pros: cheaper than redbull<br />Overall cons: still an expensive habit<br /><br />BLUE CAN, 4 stars:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Interesting/good taste.  It has a very, very fruity taste, which is refreshing compared to a lot of other energy drinks, but could kind of become too sweet/overpowering when I drank too many of these.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Compared to other energy drinks, I do not think that this goes well with alcohol (vodka) at all.  So for normal usage, it's a solid drink, for a redbull/vodka substitute, this wasn't it, for me.<br /><br />WHITE CAN, 2 stars:<br /><br />Pros: Most tolerable when mixed with alcohol.<br /><br />Cons: This is the drink that i think has the most stereotypical awful energy drink/diet taste compared to anything else i've ever had.  It just tastes so artificial and chemical-like.  Why did I even buy this drink in the first place? for a while, it was the only diet energy drink in my university's cafeteria.<br /><br />Conclusion:  I drank hundreds of these over the past 5 or so years until finally pretty much kicking my energy drink habit and switching to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>.

review/text: Caffeine isn't an upper for me, but it's a nice calmative beverage.  I can't have sugar.  So I enjoy sugar free energy drinks.  Rockstar Zero-Carb has a nice berry tea flavor too it.  It's a flavor I can live with, unlike a lot of other drinks.  I can't tell you about the buzz level, since I don't get a buzz, but a can of this will completely knock out any caffeine headache...LOL.  It's got more caff than the Sugar Free.<br /><br />Individual cans are not cost effective.  I was having trouble finding a lot of sugar free energy drinks in my area, and when I did, the prices were high.  I was thrilled to find Amazon had them at good prices... WITH FREE SHIPPING!?!?  Holy cow!  I can get a heavy case of soda shipped to my door for nada?  Now that REALLY rocks!  I don't know how they do it.  The first one came FedEx..LOL.  For free.  And fast, too!<br /><br />I've been an Amazon customer since... yikes, I don't remember the year.  Pretty much since they first opened.  Back when they used to send all their customers Christmas gifts.<br /><br />Rock on!

review/summary: Bait and switch!
review/text: Up until this week, I have LOVED Rockstar Juiced with Guava, which is 50% juice.  It is the only energy drink that I have found that I like.  Alas, this week when I purchased a new case of what is advertised as Rockstar Juiced Guava with 50% juice, I discovered that the product has been reformulated to be only 10% juice.  They have reduced the juice, but added sugar and sodium and increased the calories.  The result is a terrible-tasting beverage that is NOT what is described on their web site.  This is a classic case of bait and switch.  Rockstar is trying to increase profits by selling a watered down, awful-tasting drink.  What a slap in the face to their customers.  It reminds me of the New Coke disaster a few years back.  At least Coca Cola admitted their mistake and went back to their classic formula.  Will Rockstar be that smart?  I'm not optimistic, but until and unless they do, I will not purchase any more of their products.

I haven't tried too many (never tried Red Bull, so really...not that many :p), but this one is great. Granted, there is a lot of sugar in it (40ish grams) PLUS artificial sweetner to make a really sweet drink. But I like the taste, and I too find it refreshing. I drink Juiced Guava maybe once a week to enjoy and it perks me up but not as much as coffee does to the point I get jittery.

review/summary: New formula is absurd!
review/text: When I found out Rockstar Juiced recently changed its formula to 10% juice, I was heartbroken. I instantly fell in love with the drink when it first came out. Its 70% juice formula was to die for. When they changed it to 50% juice, I was a little disappointed since the drink seemed a little unhealthier. However, since the difference in taste was minuscule and since 50% juice is better than no juice, I let it slide. The new Rockstar Juiced is disgusting. It is packed with more sugar and calories compared to the old version and the difference in taste is very noticeable. The after feeling I got from drinking the new one was very uneasy and unsatisfying. I was an avid drinker of Rockstar Juiced. I drank at least one per day, sometimes two. I will now have to revert back to coffee & redbull. At least I am not completely heartbroken since some of my local grocery stores still carry the 50% version. But once they are completely out, goodbye Rockstar Juiced. I will miss you.

I searched the new can, knowing it appeared simular but could not find the 10% as it was cleverly hidden in the back. I then went to my recycle bin for an old can and compared. No longer proudly displayed on the front 50% real juice. I have justified this expensive,tasty and addictive treat for years and alloted 1 per family member per day. Now this case is going back and we are done with Rockstar until they bring back the higher real juice formula. I even had a stomach reaction to this one and I tend to have a goat gut. Bad taste bad product change and pissed that they reduce the juice keeping the price the same 2-3.00 per can, another misguided by greed rogue corporation. Now I cannot help but wonder if that blogger that rants that Rockstar is owned by Nazi's has some credibility. My wife really resented the fact that the new packaging was predominently identical to the old decieving her into purchasing a product she did not want or like.Back it all goes.

review/summary: Quite possibly the greatest drink ever!
review/text: I bought this back a while ago, and I'm still reaping the benefits of drinking this miraculous beverage.  I feel more alert, my social life has improved, and my urine has a wonderful neon yellow hue.<br /><br />Even though it is sealed quite nicely in it's case, after you are able to remove the can, you may want to cool down your energy drink.  My preference was to put the cans in my refrigerator, but you could get a similar effect by setting the cans in a snow bank, or by using ice cubes in a glass to cool the drink down.  My first problem came when I was ready to drink the Diet Rockstar(tm).  I looked at the can and was perplexed as to how to open it up, until I noticed this clever "tab" at the top that would pop open a perfect sized drinking hole to use.<br /><br />Once I opened it up, I quickly poured the entire contents of the Diet Rockstar(tm) into my mouth and then swallowed it.  I had heard of people not caring for the last few drops of a warmed can, so I figured that it would be best to drink it before it had the opportunity to warm up.  What a great decision that was!  Shortly afterwards I felt a burst of energy surge through my body and I was more productive then I have ever been in my life.  Normally I would take a 8:30am nap at work, but not today.  Was was ready to work and to get everything completed in a orderly fashion.  However, a problem soon surfaced as there was no more work to do for a few hours and I had all this energy to burn off.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product and would suggest that everyone purchase as much as you can.  This drink will change your life and make you complete all of your activities with ease.

review/summary: Not completely satisfied right now
review/text: I ordered these Monday night and received them Thursday afternoon, very quick delivery. The only ISSUE is that the product information stated 58 madeleines were in the box for [...], but when I checked there were only 44 madeleines in there. I am still trying to discuss this issue with them but I haven't heard anything yet. I feel that if your product information states a particular count, then there should be that many in there; otherwise change the product information so there won't be an issue. Very upset right now because I was charged more than what I should have been for these. We will see what they decide to do, and I will post back again.

review/summary: WITH THIS  "SAMPLER" VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE
review/text: Buy this in a spirit of fun , surprise and adventure, and you won't be disappointed.<br />All Donsuemor cookies are heavenly, however,<br />don't expect the same thing to be in the package every time, or you will be disappointed.<br />With this "SAMPLER" it's important to remember that variety is the spice of life.<br /><br />This is a "grab bag"; we never know what we're getting when we order this, in spite<br />of the advertisement stating (quote)<br />5 variety of flavors to satisfy all of your cravings. Traditional, Dipped, Lemon Zest, Chocolate and Dipped Chocolate<br />(end quote).<br /><br />For example, our last "SAMPLER"  box contained several ALMOND CAKES, delicious but SURPRISE!<br />And the box had none of the advertised chocolate variety at all.<br /><br />Donsuemor probably puts  "new" varieties into these samplers to get folks to taste them, but if so,<br />they don't bother to notify the customer when they're changing the contents.<br /><br />Donsuemor, you have these choices:<br />Advertise the new variety as included,<br />or state CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE<br />or give free samples of new varieties to the customer in addition to what you told them to expect.<br />But  maybe that's why you call this a SAMPLER.<br /><br />The count isn't always 58:  we have gotten less than the advertised fifty eight (58) number of cookies.<br />In addition, the inside packaging varies with each order;<br />sometimes cookies are packed as bags of six, sometimes as two of a type per bag, and sometimes as threes.<br /><br />So , each time you order this same SAMPLER expect surprises.<br />Do not expect to receive the exact same assortment of 5 varieties of 58 cookies<br />packaged in exactly the same ways.<br />Each time you order this, you'll get a different assortment  packaged in a variety of different ways and the variations are literally UP FOR GRABS.  Again, all Donsuemor cookies are heavenly, but with this "SAMPLER" remember,  variety is the spice of life.

review/summary: Saved my cat's life twice?
review/text: About 6 months ago, I found out that my kitty has kidney disease. He was extremely ill, and I was planning on putting him down if he got any worse. About that time, I got a few different cans of Friskies food. He liked the Senior Meaty Bits best, and would eat almost a can a day. He made an almost full recovery very quickly.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and my kitty gets very sick again. He's worse this time, has trouble walking, and won't eat anything consistently, which makes the disease even worse. I was actually planning on where he would be buried. I tried to feed him meaty bits, and he absolutely loved it, but he would just lick off the gravy. I decided to try putting it through the food processor, and sure enough he gobbled it all down. I guess the meaty bits were too hard for him to chew in his weakened state.<br /><br />Now it is the only food he will eat consistently, and he begs for it. I know it is meant to help with urinary infections, but I wonder if it helps with kidneys too. I am so relieved to have found my product, and I hope my kitty will be eating it for years to come.

review/summary: Solved my cat's urinary problems
review/text: At about 3 years of age, our cat would have bladder infections several times a year (straining at the litter, staying there for 5 min+ at a time, only a little urine and it was blood-tinged).  We had been feeding her only on indoor cat dry food.  After many trips to the vet and rounds of antibiotics, I read that some cats with this problem do better on wet food - something to do with not drinking enough water or just not getting enough fluids in general.  For the past 4 years, she has not had one bladder infection!  Friskies Chicken Dinner in Gravy Special Diet is the only one she likes the taste of.

My cats love all the flavors and have a huge selection to choose from. The packages are easy to open and so are the cans. I wish the meat and gravy ones could come in bigger cans but I can't complain just smile and open 24-40 cans a day.Thanks Amazon and Friskies for making me part of your family  :)

review/summary: Extremely delicious-- the best sweet barbecue sauce I've ever had
review/text: I am not a bona fide cook, nor am I a barbecue expert. Most of my sampling of authentic down-south barbecues has happened on business trips, and I've sampled most of the types of barbecue sauces available at the local grocery stores. I happened to luck on this one at the grocery store the other day when shopping for something that wouldn't be too spicy for the chillun. We brought it home that night and used it to dunk pieces of chicken, and I was blown away.<br /><br />I am at a bit of a loss as to how to describe the flavor. It is sweet and tangy, and slightly spicy but just enough to be pleasant-- I don't think people with even sensitive palates would dislike this sauce. In a way, though of course they have some different ingredients, this is like a much more refined, more delicious version of the Sweet Chili chicken nugget sauce from McDonald's, which we also like. (No, this is not the creme de la creme of food connoisseur reviews, but you knew that going in.)<br /><br />The ingredient list on my bottle includes these items in order: water, vinegar, sugar, tomato paste, molasses, and honey, with less than 2% of salt, aged cayenne pepper, natural smoke flavor, modified food starch, dextrose, spice, corn syrup, caramel color, garlic, xanthan gum, onion, sodium benzoate as a preservative, maltodextrin, tamarind, autolyzed yeast extract, and natural flavor. Ingredients may of course change over time, so make sure to read the ingredients on whatever you buy.<br /><br />I've only used it for dipping, not actual barbecue. As a grilling sauce I'd say it's ever so slightly on the thinner side of normal, possibly due to vinegar content, but would still work for grilling, especially with extra basting.<br /><br />ETA: During the writing of this review, I had to go heat up some chicken so I could have some of this sauce.  Mmmmmm.

review/summary: Crunchy and addictive peanut snack
review/text: This is a crunchy peanut snack out of the Philippines, despite the Japanese letters for "Nagaraya" across the top of the bag. It's got a satisfyingly crunchy fried outer shell surrounding a peanut on the inside. The concept and texture is similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VXZ40">Wasabi Peas</a>. They look very similar too, except without the kick and green color.<br /><br />Original is Butter Flavor. The nuts smell like a stick of butter that's been in the fridge, but depending on how much flavoring powder is on the nut, you may or may not taste the butter. I had 2 handfuls right now and there's no detectable butter flavor. The rare times I do taste the butter, it had the taste of powdered milk, not real butter like American-styled popcorn flavorings like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SU1LUU">Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Microwavable Popcorn, Naturals, Buttery, Salt and Cracked Pepper</a>.<br /><br />This is an all-natural product, with no preservatives, colorants, or artificial additives. 6 servings per bag @150 calories (60 from fat). Low sodium (85mg or 4% of daily intake), 0 cholesterol. Aside from providing calories, there's not much nutritional value except for fiber (1g, or 4% of daily intake) and iron (2%).<br /><br />Healthier than potato chips, this particular flavor was not to my liking. I'm glad I tried it, but it's not something I'd buy again. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016N2OZO">Nagaraya - Garlic Cracker Nuts 5.64 Oz.</a> might be a bit more tasty.

These are great treats to reward any animal, they are healthy and don't have any invasive odors like a lot of other pet treats. I hate to admit this, but I have tried these treats as well, don't judge me too much I know you have thought of it as well. Aside from being a little bland, they are pretty good, put a little hot sauce on them and it could pass along with most of the frozen snacks that kids eat. If you are looking for a premium treat to give to your pets I suggest Pure Bites.

review/summary: 2 bags rancid! calling company today!
review/text: UPDATED APRIL 2012: I'm returning 6 more pouches of PureBites Chicken today, after first calling the company for instructions. The same rep (female) who responded to my complaint in  Dec 2011 took my call today, but not knowing I had called before, she kept insisting there has never been a complaint about rancid bits before. I told her I called in Dec and she said "someone else likely helped you". Not wanting to argue, I moved on, but she clearly lied to me so I thought I should update about this. I was asked to include a note this time, to say where purchased but that has nothing to do with the fact that the company thinks it's "acceptable" that some fat is getting thru via processing. Fat cannot be freeze-dried so it will turn rancid even if freeze dried - read my original review and see how this was answered the 1st time I called last year...Very disappointing that the company doesn't care to hold the processing plant's feet to the fire about fat getting in, but then to lie to a customer is not good. But they will honor their satisfaction guarantee! So the only way to get this issue resolved is for all of us to get refunds. All you need to do is send the proof of purchase and your invoice to the address on the bag, along with your name & address. I find that about half of the bags are rancid. Dogs don't care, but cats won't eat rancid anything so very expensive if issue is ignored. Pls help make this company fix this issue by sending proofs in and forcing them to refund. Companies ignore issues until their wallets get hit. I hate to do this, but my cats beg for these and I'm going broke replacing rancid bags!<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought two 6.2 oz bags of PureBites Chicken for dogs, first trying out a small cat size pouch found at PetSmart, and then moved up to the dog-sized bags/chunks, which I crumble with my fingers to get them smaller for my cats, who love this product BUT both of these bags purchased on Amazon had rancid chunks that smushed into slimy/greasy mush when I crumbled them.<br /><br />The company admits this happens, said it's part of the processing, nothing can be done, but it's not acceptable, and they will refund once I send proof of purchases & invoice to them.<br /><br />So it's hit or miss, and the company agrees...so just an FYI to warn others to check their bags!<br /><br />For those feeding this to dogs, and not breaking up the chunks like I do, please take note of this and check on the chunks before feeding. You can also detect a faint rancid odor if there are rancid bits in your bags.<br /><br />The reason for the rancid chunks, according to the company is that pieces of fatty chicken do get in, and fat doesn't freeze-dry, so without preservatives, it will go rancid. I knew that, but had hoped they could offer a promise to correct this; they can't and have no intention to do so. So I'll keep buying and hoping I get good bags, but will certainly take the time to get refunded whenever this occurs.<br /><br />The product is excellent when you get a good bag..just check each piece before feeding, or if you have a good nose for rancid odors, take a whiff and you'll smell the slight rancid odor, and can return the product.

review/summary: Amazing treats!  My pets love them.
review/text: We purchase both the Chicken and the Beef Liver for our dogs...and the cats love the chicken.  Really, where else beside the butcher's shop can you get 100% meat with nothing added for your pet?  These are great for training and for an everyday treat.  I can't wait to try the Cheese product when it comes out.  HINT...to get the most for your money, sprinkle the dust at the bottom of the bag on top of their food.

review/summary: More for your money!!
review/text: I purchased these treats (packaged as cat treats) in a small bag at a high-end pet store.  I give them to my kitties when I call them to come in (thereby ensuring that they always come when I call) and they love them.  In an attempt to save money, I searched online to see if I could find a bigger package and was delighted to find this large package marketed to dogs.<br /><br />I simply cut the dog-sized pieces into smaller kitty-sizes and give them to my girls.  We're all happy and this big bag will last us a long time!

review/summary: Great for cats too!
review/text: My cats love these treats crushed on top of their food. I mix it with their dry and wet food. Sometimes I just give it to them as a snack in between meals. I love the fact that it is pure freeze-dried chicken with nothing added.

review/summary: Best Treat Ever
review/text: I use these for my cat.  You get more bang for your buck if you buy the larger dog treats and just break them into smaller pieces.  She gest them while we eat dinner, if she stratches on her post, or does something very cute.  I love these treats because I don't feel guilty giving them to her.

review/summary: Cat loves these!
review/text: I had purchased something similar to these at a cat show.  But when I tried to find them in stores it was nearly impossible.  I was so happy when I found these.  My loves them and gobbles them up.  It is the only cat treat she will eat and I have tried them all.  she hates all other treats and just walks away.  But these she begs for literally.  If you have a finicky cat like mine, these will be a hit.  I even sprinkle it on her food so she will eat it, and the dust at the bottom is great for that.  I highly recommend these treats for cats.<br /><br />Update:  I have continued to purchase these and they are still the only treat either one of my cats will eat.  The older cat has apparently taught the kitten these are the only treats worth eating.  Still a great product and I have never had problems like other reviewers had.

review/summary: GREAT for dogs AND cats!
review/text: I had been buying the PureBites at a local pet food store at a considerably higher price.  Since both my dog AND cats love these treats, I was delighted to find them cheaper on Amazon.  They are pure chicken, which is wonderfully healthy, and the best part is that they don't make my dog thirsty or have loose stool as so many other treats can do.  I think they're GREAT!
