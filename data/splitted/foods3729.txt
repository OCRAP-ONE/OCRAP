review/text: We've been using Stevia for 8 years, now, and buying this brand for one. It's very convenient to order online, rather than look for it in stores. This is a great product, although some people do prefer using the liquid concentrate for cold drinks. Just remember that, with Stevia - less is more!

review/text: My husband Kurt and I are very satisfied with Now Foods Stevia extract. We are very health conscious. Our products must be healthy, pure and natural. After searching, this is the only stevia we will buy. We recommend it to our family and anyone who wants to stay away from sugar.  Other products are full of chemicals that are worse than the sugar.  Now Foods Stevia extract powder is natural.  We only use about 1/8 of a teaspoon for a full 8oz cup of coffee. Even that may be too much. We buy it by the pound and it lasts a long time.  How can anyone not use this product to substitute sugar?! It is an excellent product. We give it at least five stars.<br />Honestly and sincerely,<br /><br /> Kurt & Linda.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MGWIH0">Now Foods Stevia Extract - Powder 1 lbs</a>

review/summary: Better Than Sugar!
review/text: I have used Stevia for several years, but often have had trouble finding it. It was a real pleasure to find it on Amazon! Stevia is a natural sweetener made from the Stevia rebaundiana leaf. It is not an artificial sweetner made with chemicals. It has no unpleasant taste, though people who use artificial sweeteners may take a few days to get used to the lack of "chemical" sweeteners. Most people who use Stevia find that they can use less of it than other sweeteners as it's sweetness level is higher per packet. I recommend Stevia to anyone who wishes not to use sugar for any reason, but still likes things a bit sweet. By the way, Stevia has no calories.

review/text: I love stevia, I have experimented with the liquid, glycerin, the one oz powder size and this is by far the best for your money.  Just be careful adding it to something cold, you might want to mix it with warm-to-hot water first to get it in liquid form before adding it.  Also, I make approx 2 liters of tea at a time and only need to add one-half teaspoon stevia powder!  I am very thankful for this 16 oz size!

review/text: I'm so glad I found this 1 pound of NOW stevia.  It is so much cheaper than the little bottles I had been buying for $8/oz.  The packaging is very wasteful--most of it is empty.  Eventually filling my little bottles will get hard unless I transfer the bulk into a smaller container.<br /><br />The taste is fine to me, better than Trader Joe's.  I've never had Kal's to know what I am missing.  I mainly use the stevia in tea and Kool Aid lemonade.  DH even liked my tea w/ stevia and he is a big sweet tea drinker.  I have started baking banana bread w/ stevia and have been very pleased.  I've never minded what little aftertaste of Stevia since my mom used Sweet N Low when I was growing up.<br /><br />FYI-The 1 pound package didn't come w/ the tiny single scoop, unless buried at bottom.  That would have been nice to have.

review/text: MDH T-Plus masala is what we in the States would call "ground chai spices". In India "chai" means "tea" and "masala" is a spice mixture, so correctly this would be "chai masala" or "spice mixture for tea". This version contains the usual suspects: anise, cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, cloves, and star anise. It would, of course, be nice to have these spices freshly ground, but when that isn't practical (is it ever?), this Indian import does the trick.

Any more than a teaspoon and it will taste gross and burn your throat like as if you were eating too much pepper!! I make the tea in the pot of boiling water so it is hard to judge how much to put in. I put in too much once and i had to throw the tea out it was too spicy and stung the back of my throat. Just too much. Its a good buy. Great flavour. Just remember, only put a little in!! Just for slight flavour!!!

review/summary: That's A Big Bottle
review/text: In some ways, if you are looking at a bottle of 1.75 Liters of Blue Label, you probably already know this is spectacular Scotch. On the other hand, I can't think of a better way to buy this Scotch, especially if I were having a party with a lot of Sctoch loving friends.<br /><br />Johnnie Walker Blue Label became my favorite Scotch whisky a few years ago when a good friend brought me a bottle as a gift for a party I threw (yes he is a great friend). I was a single malt fanatic, Lagavulin was my preferred Scotch, and I basically would drink nothing but single malt.<br /><br />Blue Label has changed my mind about blended Scotch. Right now, I would rather save my money for a bottle of this incredible drink, than squander it on other Whiskies.<br /><br />This is an incredibly smooth Scotch. There is a light smoke flavor, but the biggest notes are fruit, oak, and spices. There is nothing better than a glass of this, a fine cigar (Opus X), and good company. Not to push snobbery or useless glassware for this drink, but it does improve with a medium sized round glass. There's no need to go crazy with a huge brandy fish bowl, but a nice Riedel red wine stemless glass is just great.<br /><br />There is nothing in the world wrong with adding an ice cube to this whisky (I know purists will hate trying this). The interesting thing about ice, the first few sips are nice and smoky. As the ice melts and adds some water to the Scotch (adding a small amount of water to Scotch is an accepted way to bring out different flavors), the smoke flavor softens and other flavors come out. Then as the drink gets cold, the smoke comes back. Ice adds an interesting change to this beautiful drink - it doesn't just dilute. After all, this is your bottle of Scotch and can do what you will with it.<br /><br />Every single person I've ever shared this with has loved it. At one time Johnnie Walker had the most amazing sampler box - 200mL each of Black, Gold (sometimes Green), Single, and Blue. If you ever find that sampler, it is the best value around. This is the perfect method to compare four of the better blended Scotches made - each with their own unique character. Without fail, the fourth bottle in the tasting, Blue, is always gone by the end of the evening. Tasting is a strange word to use; it's more three people sitting around enjoying Scotch. Johnnie Walker Collection 800ML<br /><br />Cardhu is the single malt that makes up the backbone of most of the Johnnie Walker blends.<br /><br />A way to try this Scotch is to watch for Johnnie Walker events. They hold free tasting events in major cities across the country. Their website has details and a schedule.<br /><br />Is this Scotch worth the huge premium? I've tried a lot of amazing expensive and not so expensive spirits, and I say this is worth every single penny. It is the bottle I pour when something good happens and I want to celebrate, or the bottle I open when things don't go so well and I need to lift my mood. It is an incredible drink; I like to call nectar of the gods.<br /><br />There's another unique Sctoch made by Johnnie Walker, Swing. Swing is kind of hard to find, it is about half the price of Blue. It is a super smooth Scotch that's I've started to really like a lot. It's been nice in the middle of winter. Check it out if you have a chance: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HQTEYU">Johnnie Walker Scotch Swing 750ML</a>.

review/summary: Is White Cheddar supposed to taste like vinegar??
review/text: Well, the boxes were a little damaged when I got them.  No big deal because I know that there is usually extra space in between the box and the bag of crackers inside; they were fine.  However - my first bite - vinegar.  Yikes!  They taste like salt and vinegar potato chips.  Ugh!  I'm disappointed too because I love White Cheddar Cheez-Its.  Not this batch though!  I won't be buying them again.

review/summary: Distinct flavor
review/text: Amazingly fast shipping, but the product is really what you want to know about, isnt it?  Packaged in a can, this holds roughly 20 or so tea bags (the exact number escapes me).  These bags are actually pod shaped, so you could use them in your pod machines, just be aware that a 14 oz drink will require two pods.  The flavor is that of a strong black tea with a twist (more then a hint) of citrus.  I would say orange, but its more of orange peel, slighly more acidic, not as sweet.  It has a floral aroma that I might recommend honey for sweetening in place of white sugar or sweetener.

Like other fans, I order it by the case for myself and my family at home, I take a can or two to work, and usually giving more away as parts of gift baskets and things like that.  Its perfect paired with fresh baked cookies or alone with a good book when you want to snuggle up and feel relaxed.<br />I dont drink coffee, so Im a connesiur of cocoa-type drinks...this stuff is amazing!

review/text: I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows.

review/text: I ordered this as the price was certainly right (6 1lb cans for less than $30) and the reviews were good.<br /><br />This is certainly a step up in the hot cocoa market. Better than just about anything you can find in the supermarket. I certainly prefer hot chocolate - but it can be time-consuming to make and it's tough to heat milk and melt chocolate at work or in class.<br /><br />This is the perfect compromise for when you want that chocolate drink and aren't in a position to 'do it right'.<br /><br />Very good taste and dissolves well. I always use a little more than it says on the can - with some cocoa that means it won't all dissolve - this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Certainly recommended.

review/summary: Stephen's Hot Candycane Cocoa is the best!
review/text: We have been drinking Stephen's Candycane Cocoa for several years.  Our Walmart carries it at Christmas time, but they run out fast.  It's the candycane pieces in the cocoa that make it soo good!  You can make it as strong or weak as you like it, by adding more cocoa or more water than the directions say.  I like it a little stronger - it gives it a bold chocolate taste with a strong candycane kick!  I don't know what else to tell you except it is absolutely out of this world!  All you need is a cup, a spoon, hot water, and Stephen's Candycane Cocoa.  You're set, drink up!  Just remember not to use it all up in one setting!<br /><br />Honestly, the only thing I would change about this product is the number of cups of cocoa per can.  It calls for 3 1/2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa mix per 6 ounces of hot water.  When Sara and I make a 12 oz cup each and each have a refill, we can almost kill off one can in a sitting.  (Yes, it IS that good!)  I wish Stephen's could concentrate this or put it up in larger cans.<br /><br />I hope I have helped in your purchasing decision.

review/text: These folks are right.  This stuff is very rich and we just use skim milk.  Richer than the expensive chocolate shavings we have splurged on in the past.  The tins go along ways too.  The per serving cost is a fraction of buying the individual packets at the grocery store of other brands, but I would pay more anyway because this stuff is so good.  We just had to order another case.  Try it with some coffee.  Mash it up in some vanilla ice cream. Seems like they could sell it for much more if they got rid of the dude's first name.  First name only brands really cheese up the product.  How about "Cocoa Passions" or "Divine Cocoa" or even, "Serenity Now Cocoa".  Anything would Glam up the product name a little. I am a builder, would you buy an expensive house from "Kreg's Stately Mansions"? Nope.  Doesn't matter how choice the work is. I am sorry, Stephen, you do have a great product, I'll stop. Oh well, keep the prices low...Five stars, brother.

review/text: I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: I ordered the No Sugar Added version. I usually like no sugar added or low sugar products - ice cream, yogurt, hot chocolate etc. But this one was terrible. Like the other reviewer, this tasted like ovaltine. I had to use like 5 spoons of the powder to get the taste. I don't know what to do with 5 other cans.. I will probably donate..

review/summary: It's the Best
review/text: I have tasted several Stephen's Gourmet products, but the Chocolate Raspberry is my favorite. It's creamy, smoothe and delicious.  I consider it my one splurge for myself.  I have a cup every morning and have now shared my favorite beverage with my son, who just cannot get enough of it.  He has created different recipes with it, one using ice cream.  I will stick to the original method.  It's the best hot cocoa mix I have ever tasted.  The aroma alone will draw you in.  I am often asked what is that wonderful smelling beverage.  Occasionally I will share in hopes they will purchase their own.  Stephen's Gourmet makes the best cocoa ever.  I will drink it as long as they continue to make it.

review/text: I love this stuff!  This is my favorite of the flavors I have tried.  I do feel like I have to add quite a bit of chocolate powder to get it to the flavor that I like, but that is okay.  I'd take this over any of the other stuff any day.  Swiss Miss is for the kids and this stuff is for me.  My husband loved the milk chocolate...until he tried the amaretto.  I just stick with this because I haven't found that I like the others as much.  Even though I don't like the others as much, all of the Stephen's cocoa that I have tried is the richest out there.  It doesn't taste like I mixed it with water at all.

review/summary: Real Candy Cane Shavings In This!
review/text: This is the best candy cane cocoa, and it has real bits of candy cane. Don't worry, it's not totally sharp... Most of it dissolves in the liquid.<br /><br />I mix my cocoa with a battery operated frother, which uses every single bit of cocoa, so there is not a single bit of cocoa on the bottom.<br /><br />After, it's really a pepperminty cup of chocolate that is very lovely. Refreshing, I'd say.<br /><br />This is a must with milk, though I think you can do it with water... but milk is best to get the full flavor effect.

review/summary: Stephens Gourmet NSA Hot Chocolate
review/text: If you've read the other reviews about Stephens hot chocolate, well, the same for this one. It tastes rich and good. I'm diabetic type II and there is nothing else in hot chocolate that comes close without being loaded with sugar. Diabetes really narrows the field when it comes to things you can eat or drink so am glad that Stephens makes this product. In every shiny white cloud there is a bit of soot hiding somewhere. The lump of coal is that they don't sell it in Canada and won't ship across the border. That is so sad. Canadians having to deal with yet another item they can't get. Not sure why this is whether US government, Canadian border guards with a grudge, or Stephens just don't want extra paper work. Thank goodness for friends who go on trips down south and bring it back for me. Good stuff.

review/text: Make per directions and use half & half to top off for richer taste, maybe a little whipped cream topper and you have have a melt in the chair, soft spot, where visions of sugar plums and the like may begin to dance in your heads.  Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.  I have no qualms with the seller and would openly consider their services on this open market again as the purchase made sense.  Thank you for reading this far and for your consideration in advance.

review/summary: Not exactly sure how to rate this
review/text: I bought this mostly based on the reviews. I really wanted hot chocolate from Stephen's, but amazon didn't have it. I stumbled across this and thought I would try it. It is white, even though "cocoa" is in the title...in case you didn't figure that out! I did realize it wasn't chocolate, but didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like a vanilla milkshake, but hot! I happen to love vanilla milkshakes way more than chocolate ones (but hate drinking milk, go figure), but somehow, I haven gotten used to this product after about a week. I have 6 cans now, so I have many more opportunities to try! It may just be that I sort of mentally "expect" hot chocolate and I have to retrain my slow brain! It is interesting and different, and I still drink it, and almost like it, but still would pick pick the hot chocolate over this. Definitely worth a try if you like vanilla.

review/summary: The richest tasting hot cocoa I've ever tasted.
review/text: I bought a can of Stephen's hot cocoa over 5 years ago not realizing how good it was going to be. After I drank the first few cups I was hooked and could not find it anywhere again. I ordered it directly from the company for several years and even took several cans to the UK with me when we moved over taking care to make them last. I'm very glad to find this brand on amazon as it's rich flavor surpasses all others I've tried. If you love dark chocolate this is it. I haven't tasted the other flavors but would be willing to bet they are just as good. I may order some for stocking stuffers for Christmas.<br /><br />I also like that this comes in a can with a scoop so you can make it more or less chocolatey as you like or adjust the amount of powder for the size of your mug/cup. The pre-measured packs that most hot cocoa comes in are supposed to be for an 8oz cup and most mugs are 12oz so 2 packets is too strong and one only fills your mug half way. If you'd like very rich hot chocolate you can use 1/2 milk and 1/2 water. You really don't need marshmallows.

review/text: I love all of the cocoa in the Stephen's Gourmet line, but I think this one is my favorite. The other people in my family have different favorites (we all love Stephen's), but we all agree the Belgian Dark ranks at the top for the best all-purpose drinking cocoa.<br /><br />I like my cocoa with a little added milk in it, and starting out with a good DARK cocoa allows me to achieve that milky texture without sacrificing that rich chocolate flavor.<br /><br />As an added bonus, Stephen's cocoa is labeled "Gluten Free" -- taking the guesswork out of choosing a cocoa for those of us who must avoid gluten-containing additives such as barley malt (a common ingredient in chocolate).

review/summary: Taste is individual
review/text: I LOVE dark chocolate so when I saw the reviews of this kind I figured I'd give it a try.  Now taste is a matter of individuality so I'll give you the difference in this Belgian Dark Chocolate by Stephen's and my usual Nestle Rich Chocolate:<br /><br />Belgian:150 calories per serving,  serving is 3Tlb mix and only 3/4 cup water or milk.<br />vs<br />Nestle: 80 calories w/water per serving, serving is 2Tlb mix and a WHOLE cup of water.<br /><br />Belgian: Total Fat 3.5g,  Sodium 240mg, Total Carbs 27g, Sugars 22g, Protein 2g<br /><br />Nestle: Total Fat 3g, Sodium 170mg, Total Carbs 15g, Sugars 12g, Protein 1g<br /><br />I first mixed the Belgian mix as directed but couldn't finish it due to the fact that it was just too sweet for me.  It IS creamy, but just too sweet.  When I use the Nestle I only use 1/2Tlb and a squirt of dark choc. syrup and I'm happy with that.  So I then mixed the Belgian as I do with the Nestle and it's ok.  I can't rave about it due to the fact that it's higher in sugars and sodium than the Nestle and if you are trying to watch those things you might want to take that into consideration.<br />To me dark chocolate shouldn't be as sweet(or sweeter) as milk chocolate, I'm sure that's why I prefer dark chocolate.  I'll even add some unsweetened chocolate powder to my mix at times.<br /><br />But as I've said it's all in your individual taste, I just wish they would have listed the Nutrient Facts along with their ingredients.<br />Not bad, just not all that great if you don't like REALLY sweet hot chocolate.

It is definitely not up to the level of Archer (Target brand), Twinings (some grocery stores), or Cadbury (overseas or very few grocery stores).<br /><br />Cocoa is the 4th ingredient. No chocolate as an ingredient. Bunch of fats and fillers. Archer has cocoa as the second ingredient and chocolate as the 4th and 5th ingredient. That's more like it.<br /><br />Stephen's chocolate has bad/very light color, little aroma, thin, doesn't dissolve. A very disappointing purchase.

review/summary: Does not live up to the hype~
review/text: Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />"cocoa."  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~

Just as with good coffee, its not necessary to make it overly sweet or flavored since there aren't that many sweet-freak-fatties drinking it. The ancient Incas didn't use any sugar at all with their chocolate!<br /><br />I did give it an extra star just for having a dark chocolate drink product since their aren't many companies that even make one, so kudos to them for that.

review/text: Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />"cocoa."  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br /><br />It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla<br />milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....<br /><br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and<br />clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~

review/summary: Surprise...bait and switch.
review/text: The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution.

review/summary: Warning: Make sure you're buying the right flavor.
review/text: I bought some of this chocolate for my mother who can't have much caffeine. She used to drink Nestle hot cocolate, fat free-caffeine free, but they stopped making it in canisters so you have to buy it only the expensive way in the puches. Anyway, I saw the milk chocolate flavor of Stephen's on here, looked up info and found out it was low in caffeine so I ordered a BUNCH of it for mom. 110 bucks worth. We got it today and I opened it up and all of the cans were minct chocolate flaovor. I thought they sent the wrong kind... I checked my order and found out I indeed ordered the wrong flavor. See, the canisters look EXACTLY the same except the milk chocolate flavor has a small brown strip in the middle and the mint chocolate has a small green strip in the middle. That's the ONLY difference between the canisters. And since the initial thumbnail images on Amazon are so small, it's easy to not see such a little difference. yes, its' technically my fault, but they need more difference in artwork on the canisters. Not only that, Amazon would not take it back, even though it all was unopened, because its "food". and the company who makes it basically said "Sorry, but it sucks to be you". So here I sit, 110 dollars worth of hot chocolate which no one can use.
