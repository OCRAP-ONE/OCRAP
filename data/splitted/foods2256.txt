review/summary: A Perfect Mocha Latte
review/text: If you want the decadent indulgence of one of those coffee house lattes without all the calories, this is the way to go! This matcha is sweet, chocolatey, coffee goodness and as a hot latte it's every bit as good as a drink from Starbucks. Actually... it's way better! The flavors are just so delicious and realistic tasting. Better for sure than fake chocolate syrup and piles of whipped cream! Plus, as a wonderful bonus, it's actually good for you.

review/summary: Mmmmm MOCHA!
review/text: Ohhhh I so love this matcha!<br />It was way better than a Starbucks mocha latte!<br />I did however make this in my typical latte manner with ice, milk, and creamer with the matcha base.<br /><br />I also as always tasted this matcha straight and it sure could have satisfied me without all the additions but habits die hard and I wanted a cool drink.<br />The mocha taste was so good, a little like coffee, a little like dark chocolate and a whole lot of YUM!<br /><br />I feel so spoiled with my morning matcha routine and can't imagine how I ever got motivated in the mornings without it.<br /><br />The kind of energy boost it gives you is so wonderful - not jittery or excitable but just the right level of boost and it feels like a good clean energy. This is coming from a former Red Bull junkie as well!<br /><br />Actually I also used to be addicted to coffee as well so this gives me both the energy boost I crave along with the flavor of a good coffee! It does have a good coffee flavor too! Its not too strong of a coffee flavor either although I used to adore strong coffee.<br /><br />This one is excellent for my morning "fix".

review/summary: First time for matcha, but not the last!
review/text: I had never had matcha before and wanted to try it for the adults in the family who want a good supply of energy and antioxidants, too.  I used this to make a mocha matcha latte, adding it to my morning glass of chocolate skim milk, and it tastes like a pricey coffee shop drink!  I can't wait until my daughter comes home so she can try it, I know she will be hooked.

review/summary: Tastes just like an expensive coffee house drink!
review/text: This is my latest taste adventure from Red Leaf Tea! Now, I consider myself a bit of a coffee expert. I don't drink much coffee now but I used to live on the stuff and have had more than my fair share of traditional hot and iced mocha coffees. I wasn't super convinced that the mocha flavor would translate well to matcha, but I gave it a shot. I'm really glad that I did! This is pretty awesome. You can find more information and order some of this Mocha Matcha for yourself here: [...].<br /><br />I knew once I opened the pouch that I was in for a treat! This smells like a rich, dark chocolate with just a tiny bit of a coffee aroma coming through. Out of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this one had the most powerful aroma. Once again, I was impressed that the matcha was a beautiful, bright green despite being flavored. I immediately wanted to have this cold since that is how I prefer my coffee based mochas. So I added a really hefty scoop of this matcha into a blender bottle along with milk and a tiny drizzle of honey. After shaking it all up, it smells just like sitting in a coffee house!  The taste of this is completely awesome.  If I was blindfolded, I would be certain that this was a coffee based drink. The chocolate is dark and rich with the coffee flavors just backing everything up. The coffee flavoring isn't bitter or overpowering. I think I can taste just a hint of the matcha towards the end of the sip, but the flavoring is really in control of this  blend.<br /><br />Even though I almost always drink tea rather than coffee, it is nice to have something that will suit my occasional coffee cravings without having to brew an entire pot (and have the entire house smell) or go to an overpriced coffee shop. Like all of the matchas I've tried from Red Leaf Tea, this is really great and I think it would make a good addition to any baked good. I'm thinking that adding it to buttercream to top a chocolate cake would really set things off.  This is a great gateway matcha for those who enjoy coffee. There is no bitterness that matcha can sometimes have and the flavors are bold with a good kick of caffeine.

review/text: I have to be honest, I was vary of trying a chocolate-coffee flavored green tea. I wasn't sure what to expect. Coffee, chocolate, and matcha? I was skeptical. But all my doubts were blown away by the amazing flavor of this tea. When I opened the package, I knew I hadn't made a mistake. It smells like mocha. I made it into a cold almond milk latte and was just blown away by how well the flavor resembles a coffe-chocolate drink. I didn't feel like I was drinking matcha. I felt like I was drinking one of those high-calorie overpriced coffee shop drinks. It tastes awesome and it's good for my body. What more could a girl want?

review/summary: Mochamochamochamocha!
review/text: Now, when I was in college, I worked in the campus library. Said campus library also contained a coffee shop where I got an employee discount, so I lived on sugary coffee drinks. I loved them, especially anything mixed with caramel. I learned how to brew coffee at home (yes, it took me until college to learn this), but it was never quite the same, so day after day I bought coffee after expensive coffee. It turns out, my body takes issue with both caffeine and dairy, so eventually I had to give up coffee. Have you ever seen a librarian strung out on coffee? Scary stuff. But considering I only liked it with extra sugar and way too much cream, it was probably for the best. Now, every once in a while my father in law will brew up a two cup pot when we're at his house and offer me a cup, but I just don't touch coffee anymore. Haven't since I started drinking looseleaf tea about two years ago. But occasionally, I miss it. Occasionally I just want a big cup of creamy coffee goodness and I have to tell myself no.<br /><br />So when I spotted this matcha, I had to have it. The caffeine in matcha doesn't affect me the way the caffeine in coffee does, and so I am very, very eager to try this. Maybe I'll even sprinkle in a bit of caramel....next time.<br /><br />When the package is opened, the smell of coffee hits you square in the nose. Mmm, I miss that smell. That smell only grows stronger as the matcha is brewed...mmm, it smells yummy. Okay, so, it's love at first sip. It tastes like strong, sweet coffee. It is lovely...there's even a hint of chocolate! I can't wait to try this in latte form with some Caramel Matcha...maybe even the English Toffee to bring out the chocolate in both. Definitely begging to be mixed with vanilla soy milk.  If you're a coffee fan, or an ex-coffee fan like myself, this is a matcha to try. It's so, so good. It's like an expensive coffee from Starbucks without the too high price tag and the horrible side effects of coffee! The aftertaste is almost one of roasted barley, which I like. Coffee always tasted burnt to me. But this is lovely. I see a happy future for me with this matcha at my side.

review/text: Unless the objective is a sugary flavor, stick with the original!  This "Bold & Spicy" is neither nor.  It's very dense which is nice for texture and variety, but it is so sweet, it ruins the drink.  It's hard to say where this "bold" jazz comes from-- to be frank, it's pretty bland.<br /><br />The original M&M T mix is far superior and there are many other brands that offer better flavor than this "BS" variation.  ;)

review/text: Wow - bold AND spicy!  I never liked Bloody Marys because I don't like tomato juice, however after being laid over at an airport recently in the early hours, hung over and just wanting to go home already after a week of partying, my travel partner bought me one and I couldn't be rude, so I tried it.  Wow!  Refreshing and really enjoyable.  I've tried them before with homemade mixes and other brands as people are always going on about how great these are, but this is absolutely the only brand I've ever liked.  Highly recommended especially for a bold flavor.

review/summary: The Best Mayo in the World!
review/text: I live in CA and had never heard of Duke's Mayo until I was searching for the "perfect" Pimento Cheese spread recipe. My mom in the 1960's use to buy Kraft pimento cheese spread in a little jar and spread it on celery sticks for appetizers but I wanted to do a recipe from scratch. Almost all of the authentic southern recipes called for Duke's. I found it on Amazon and ordered a small jar just to test it out. I have never tasted such good mayo in my life. I am now ordering the 4-pack of the large jars. My pimento-cheese spread was a hit on Thanksgiving and I showed everyone the Duke's mayo and they were sold on the taste and texture. Love that there is NO sugar in this mayo, too. I just made tuna melts over the weekend and used Duke's and I am not kidding...BEST tuna melt ever - totally different taste than other mayonaisse. So glad Amazon had it - my next stop will be my local grocer to see if they can carry it here!

review/text: This is a mixed revue. We have purchased this same coffee in the past and enjoyed it. This time we are less than enthusiastic. The first bag was so bad I almost called to return the shipment. The second bag is better but not really all that good. My wife is more critical than I am and finds the coffee weak and tasteless. I have tried increasing the amount used with little change in flavor. I have even used bottled spring water with no difference noted.<br /><br />Money wise this is a pretty good bargain; but based on the lack of quality we will not make another purchase of Pear's Columbian Supremo Decaf.

review/summary: My Wire Fox Terrier Loves Them!!!
review/text: These are my 3 year old wire fox terrier's favorite treats of all, and he's a picky little guy.  He's not a big fan of even smoked, flavored rawhides, and sometimes may even turn his nose up at a smoked pig ear (though that is rare and usually just when he's pouting).  These he NEVER turns down, and he goes absolutely berserk when I open the pack and he smells aroma wafting down.  And they do have a fairly strong, though not unpleasant odor - fairly citrusy.  That's not too surprising, because these treats are full of vitamin C, which according to the packaging is important for canine dental health (I assume lack of vitamin C in a dog's diet can cause a similar condition to scurvy).  Since Vitamin C is a non water soluble vitamin, it is important not to overdose your dog (water soluble vitamins like B vitamins are nearly impossible to overdose on because you/your dog will just pee excess vitamin out, but with non water soluble vitamins like vitamin C, it can accumulate in the body and, in excess, cause harm), so stick to the recommended daily "dose" on the packaging.  Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to neatly break them into smaller pieces (I don't even bother), so these are not ideal training treats.<br /><br />As for how long these treats last, I think that depends on your dog's breed and your individual dog. They are each rather dense and heavy.  My little wire fox tends to demolish things pretty quickly - he consumes a large smoked pig ear in less than five minutes, he once ripped a plank of wood off the side of the garage while trying to get to a groundhog, etc, and these treats last him about 30 seconds.  One thing that I found interesting about these treats in particular is that, though he seems to love the flavor, he also seems compelled to drink a healthy several gulps from his water bowl after finishing one.  Surely enough, the packaging says to make sure your pet has access to water when given these treats.  So, two things I think are important to mention: don't overfeed these treats to your pet, and make sure your pet has access to water.  The package says max 2 treats per day; he's a little guy so I just give him one.<br /><br />As far as his breath is concerned, I haven't really noticed any change, perhaps it has an added citrus scent for a few minutes after he finishes the treat, but that's it.  I don't think these are breath-freshening so much as they supply the dog important nutrients for his/her oral health, but perhaps some people like the added citrus scent to their pet's breath.  They're not a substitute for tooth brushing (or using a brushless tooth cleaner), but they do make an excellent treat!<br /><br />So, in summary: wonderful treat that dogs love, not great for training because it can't be broken down, contains vitamin C for oral health so you don't want to give your dog too many in one day, and very mildly freshens breath for a few minutes, and takes a 25 pound terrier about 30 seconds to consume, so it is something of a cross between a nutritious treat and a short-lived toy.

review/summary: Fantastic Italian Truffle Cheese!!
review/text: If you like mozzarella-type cheeses and consider mushrooms their own food group, buy this cheese immediately.  I had it at a wine bar in San Diego with my sister and the owner was kind enough to let me sneak a peek at the label so I could buy some of my own.  It's a large ball of cheese that comes in it's own fancy woven container and is perfect for putting out at a party with crackers -- that is if you don't eat the entire thing yourself beforehand.  The texture is medium firm and it has a melt-in-your-mouth creaminess.  The black truffle bits in the cheese give it the most amazing taste - not extremely overpowering like some truffle oils can be, but just the right amount of truffle taste.  The truffle bits are not discernible texture-wise (important if you like consistency of texture like I do!) This is such a unique tasting cheese and is certain to impress your guests if you serve it, or if you do keep it all to yourself, try it melted on crusty bread with a slice of ham and with a glass of prosecco. Delish!

review/summary: Gets me through the morning!
review/text: I'm a little hypoglycemic, and most breakfast cereals leave me starving at 10a.m. Breadshop Granolas are a huge blessing for me because they get me through until nearly 1 p.m. (This applies to Blueberry 'n Cream and the similar raspberry and strawberry offerings ... but not the Triple Berry Crunch, which is different.) I really can't overstate how important this cereal is to me, which I know seems odd, but to have energy and focus to "go" until lunchtime and not get hungry and grumpy in the middle of the morning has been a true lifestyle change for me.<br /><br />As for taste, it's low sugar but not unsweetened, which I enjoy. My kids like it and prefer it over the silly cereals they sometimes cajole me into buying them because of the cartoons on the packaging, so they end up eating "my" cereal and we throw away the stale junk.<br /><br />For anyone who tends to get hungry before lunch, I give this my highest possible recommendation. For others, I give it the thumbs up on taste.

review/text: This product is only sweetened oatmeal with varying amounts of blueberries, but there is absolutely NO GRANOLA in any of the the 4 boxes I've eaten so far.  So when the box says Granola, read oatmeal and six dried blueberries.  It tastes fine for what it is, just know that it is not granola (like the box says it is).

review/text: The Sugar Daddy was and apparently still is one of the best suckers/pop of all time.  At least I think so.  They are also an excellent check for loose fillings.  I wasn't sure if the ones I ordered would be the same as existed in the 50s and 60s.  They are.  Today they may be sealed better but are still the same great tasting caramel.  Now if only I could hide them from my grandchildren. ;-)

review/summary: Made me a believer again
review/text: After being a loyal Mrs. Butterworth's user for 10+ years I decided to ditch the high fructose stuff and go pure Maple.  A few smaller bottles from the store turned me off of 100% pure maple syrup...the stuff I got was too bitter.  Then I got some smaller bottles with breakfast at Cracker Barrel which were a 50/50 blend of maple and cane syrups that were pretty good.  I found Uncle Luke's about 6 months ago and was pleasantly suprised with the balance of sweetness and maple flavor in a 100% maple syrup.  It has restored my faith.  My tiny kids also pick this over the standby bottle of Mrs. B we have at home too.  Who woulda figured?

review/summary: Dark chocolate at its best
review/text: I agree with previous reviews. Lindt chococalates can't be beat, especially these ones which have a soft center. Ordering them during warm weather or to warm weather destinations might pose a problem, as they tend to melt a bit (even though they are sent with excellent isolating packaging), but if they are not for a gift, this should not be a problem, as the flavor remains good. Plus the price is excellent. I hope it will not increase as it happened with the Hershey's 100 calorie bars, which are now ridiculously overpriced. As a matter of fact, this is how I came across these beauties: looking for affordable dark chocolate alternatives. Would highly recommend.

review/summary: Top-notch - I've tried almost all granola bars brands and these are my favorite
review/text: Excuse my gushing, but I love these. For starters, they taste great. Also, they have far less sugar than almost all other brands. Look on the boxes of most bars and you'll see you're getting a big dose of sugar. Besides being bad for you, it gives you a sugar high for 20 minutes then brings your energy below average. Finally, I agree with the other review on here that said it tastes like your eating real food. It's hard to describe but it's different than any bar I've had before in that manner. I highly recommend Carman's. Out of the flavors, I like their green box best, followed by the orange Apricot box, and the red fruit flavored one 3rd.

review/text: I have never enjoyed the sugary admixture of refined ingredients congealed to form American granola bars.  They do not even taste healthy.  So I was taking a chance when I bought a box of these muesli bars on the "clearance" (1/2 price loss-leader) rack of a small chain bulk food store in Southwest Florida.  I was beyond surprised when I actually tasted real whole ingredients: oats, almonds, and apricots in these delicious muesli bars from Australia.  I hope Amazon will carry them soon...  They would be a perfect "subscribe and save" item.

review/summary: A cold and flu season must-have!
review/text: I just got my second box of this tea! Flavor-wise, it's not the most exciting tea I've had. I suppose I'd describe it as pleasantly earthy and mild, with no one ingredient especially strong. For a "medicinal" tea, however, I think unoffensive is good enough. I love it with honey.<br /><br />As for helping with colds, I can't say for sure, since a little relaxation with hot decaffeinated tea of any variety usually helps me feel better, but I do suspect this tea helps a bit more than others, both short-term, by relieving stuffiness, and it seems to reduce the overall duration of colds too. Whether it's really "medicinal" or it's just old fashioned "plenty of rest and fluids" doing the work, I'm superstitious enough about this tea that I won't let myself run out!

review/text: I don't like the other flavors of this, so having all cherry is perfect!<br /><br />The candy itself- Hard candy, with a powdery center that fizzes in your mouth. If you bite into it, there is a lot of foam that builds up and it's a strange feeling. I usually just suck on it until I get to the middle. There are two little holes on either end that form as you suck on it, and the power escapes and fizzes periodically. It's great.<br /><br />Caution- these little candies are highly addictive and I have found myself eating 10 in a row.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: My favorite
review/text: My favorite tea. Hands down. GORGEOUS rose fragrance. Smells natural - not at all like potpourri. "Natural Rose Flavor" is the last ingredient (after tea + roses), so I'm guessing they boost the tea with a little Rose Otto because it smells genuine to me. Light tea flavor. No bitterness.<br /><br />I bought the Numi White Rose tea and I much prefer this one. The Numi tastes grassier and has very little rose scent, but then again, has only 2 ingredients: tea + rose. I just wish the Rishi was a little cheaper. I still buy it because I can't find a cheaper alternative that's comparable. The tin lasts ~2 weeks if I have 1 cup a day. A 2nd steeping tastes great. I usually do a 3rd and sometimes a 4th, but its not that flavorful after the 2nd steep. Also, the tin has outer lid + 2nd inner lid, so product stays fresh. I buy it 3 at a time with the Amazon subscription for 23. At Whole Foods, its 10 per tin!

There was no vacuum sealed bag to begin with when I first opened the tin.  The next thing that hit me was the smell, it smells just like potpourri.  I gave it a few chances and every time the rose was over powering. I even tried multiple steepings to help mellow out the flavor and the rose was still an assault on my nose and taste buds. I can't even taste the white tea through the rose.  Also, the rose in this tea is not rose-hips, but actual rose petals.  Will not be buying again.

review/text: We received this gift basket...very unimpressed when we opened it...very little product,fancy boxes<br />with tiny amounts made to look big in this basket....the butter cookies were the kind you get at<br />Walgreens in a tin...and they gave you a few in a little box made to look fancy.  The almonds were so salty<br />you could not eat them and really nice that they gave you "one" package of hot chocolate makes 8oz...not even two<br />for you and a spouse or friend...not very professional at all.  Everything was so stuck together with sticky dots that you couldn't set anything down or it stuck to something else. Lots of filler in the basket to make it look<br />full....they need to improve their presentation and products.  Would not recommend.

review/summary: Nice gift basket
review/text: This basket was a good choice to say Thanks to my daughter's host family. She was in the US last January.  We live outside the US, and wanted to express our gratitude to all the members of that family. I chose that basket because it brings goodies for everyone to share.  Contact with the seller and delivery time was excellent.

review/summary: OMG -- The Price!!!
review/text: This rice vinegar is absolutely the best salad dressing just as is... low in calories and delicious. I also puree raspberries (either fresh or frozen) and add to the vinegar. Best to strain out the larger seeds, and it makes the most delightful raspberry vinaigrette ever. I've even tried it with fresh strawberries (no straining needed) which is a completely different taste but equally delicious.<br /><br />The low rating is not for the product, but rather for the price -- $11.99 for a 12 oz. bottle when I can, and do, buy the identical product for $4.09 at Safeway, less than a mile from me. For anyone who is completely unable to locate it I'd say: "Get it even at this price," but in my case, I'd be a total fool.

review/summary: good stuff
review/text: first let me say that i have not purchased this from amazon only my local gym it is cheaper on here so i will be buying it from here soon as far as the product my trainer introduced it to me and my friend, since we was trying to lose weight and build lean muscle, i have used it roughly 2 months and love it i drink it every morning and it curbs my appetite i can go till 1:00 or later before i start felling hungry where before i was hungry from the moment i woke till i went to bed, i also drink my shake after my workouts in the evening 3 times a week. as far as the taste if you just mix with water for me it is a little hard to swallow, i blend up frozen blueberry's and strawberry's which i thaw and add 2/3 cup water mix with powder in a shaker pretty good stuff you can also leave berries frozen to make shake thicker and more like a milk shake if you add powder to blender to mix it will be a little foamy that's why i mix it in a shaker if you decide to buy it try different ways till you find the way you like to drink it!

review/summary: Excellent Protein
review/text: This protein has an excellent amino acid complex. I prefer Milk and Egg over why proteins as they are absorb into your body more efficiently. Whey protein is absorbed quickly, and if you are only working out once or twice a day, then a lot of the protein isn't going to get absorbed effectively. Milk and Egg based proteins take longer, so you get a constant flow of protein rather than having your body trying to absorb it a couple times a day. I take about 2 scoops of this protein, 2-4 times a day, and, working out every other day, I've been putting on about 5lbs every other week.

review/summary: NOT CHOLESTEROL FREE
review/text: I bought this because the amazon page says that it is "cholesterol free." It isn't...it actually has more than most (I think around 40% of your daily intake in one serving). Plus it tasts REALLY bad (I've been mixing it with Muscle Milk to cover the taste because I'm too cheap to just throw it away), it's extremely grainy (kinda coats your throat going down making it super gaggy) and sometimes all the protein in it dumps out and coagulates into a nasty ball inside the shake ball in my shaker-cup if I don't drink it fast enough...I've eaten some pretty horrible stuff (mostly on dares) and I can't handle a Universal only protein shake...too nasty. I'm sticking souly to Muscle Milk and Optimum Nutrition brand protein powders...lower cholesterol (Muscle Milk is only 5% per serving) and MUCH better taste.

You will need a can opener.  One of the reasons that we bought this instead of the larger size Campbell's Chicken Broth is because of its ease of use.  Anyway, it is still a great value; less $ then Target/Wal-Mart/Fred Meyer.

There is no hint in the taste that these candies are sugar free.  They taste like they should and with no "chemicalish" after taste of any kind. I was truly pleasantly surprised and I plan to send them to other folks that I know who also have diabetes.  Actually, whether you have diabetes or not isn't relavent... if you like good candy and want less sugar, try these.<br /><br />j. r. in Houston

review/text: I and my dogs love the chicken chips. I have bought them for several year. I was disappointed in the size of these chips and the texture as well. I have small dachshunds so I break one of these chips in two. They are not crunchy, but soft in the middle. I think the crunchy ones help keep my dog's teeth clean. I don't think these soft ones will do that. Nothing wrong with the quality.

review/summary: Great tasting Cake!
review/text: I have a weakness for sweets so when I had the opportunity to choose only one delicious looking sweet from FantasiCakes it was a challenge. After going back and forth a few times I decided to choose the 8" Blueberry Bundt Cake since I love blueberry muffins. When I received my cake I had to try it right away, it also came with white frosting to top it off. My first bite was delicious, it tasted just like a blueberry muffin and was so soft, you could tell this was made just recently, and the icing really made it stand out even more. Now with too much icing it did get a little too sweet for me but it was really good when I didn't pile it on a piece. Unfortunately just like me my boyfriend has a sweet tooth also and ate about half of the cake :( I had to tell him not to eat anymore before I got no more of it.

review/summary: Truly, just don't  go there.
review/text: I am sorry to have to post this review, but these must be one of the worst foods I've ever eaten.<br /><br />I am a food lover.  I am understanding about weird foods.  I'm open minded and generally, pretty friendly with most foods out there except organ meats and grilled/boiled or otherwise prepared animal appendages.<br /><br />This stuff has made me feel SO BAD, I am just plain mad about it.<br /><br />Maybe it's a bad joke, to take a nice, wholesome vegetable like kale and add every possible powdered flavouring to a dessicated version of the species?  Maybe I've been the victim of somebody's idea of making fun of raw foodists and vegetarians?  I am seriously thinking so, because these are just plain BAD.  Really BAD.<br /><br />I bought these because I've purchased "raw food products" before.  The nutrient picture looks good.  The "organic" element seems promising.  I cringed at the price, but I tried them.  I am deeply regretful I did.<br /><br />I am sorry Rhythm Superfoods.  I don't like giving bad reviews, but these kale chips have given me a headache, heartburn, palpitations, a very upset stomach, and a really bad mood.  Never again!  I am sticking to real, fresh raw kale from now on, and I strongly advise everyone to do the same, because this product is so far from raw, it's incredible.

review/summary: Decent training treat, as long as your dog isn't super picky!
review/text: Cloud Star's Tricky Trainers are bite-sized, palatable, chewable treats that are approximately 0.5 inches big. They come in three main flavors: cheddar, liver, and salmon. I sampled (well, JP, my dog, sampled) two flavors: cheddar and liver. These treats were perfect sized for putting into a Kong treat dispenser, and were generally palatable (JP finds them much more palatable then dry treats). I found the Tricky Trainers surprisingly more "dry" than most pocket-sized treats, however. In other words, they don't seem to be oily to touch, aren't excessively moist, and have a high anti-squish (i.e., firm) factor. This is beneficial if you're using them as true training treats to reward your dog (i.e., storing them in your pocket). Their con: I found the cheddar smell to be repulsive - it has a really strong smell, so if you're cheese shy, avoid. Cheddar is the 5th ingredient (remember, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance (from most to least). For the other two flavors, chicken liver and salmon are listed first. The other con: the number of calories per treat isn't listed, so we don't know exactly how "low fat" or "low calorie" they truly are. The final con: if you have a super picky puppy that you are trying to train (and are using these as food motivation rewards), these may not work as well as small pieces of hot dog or pieces of freeze-dried liver treats. When it comes to puppy training, finding a treat that your dog can't resist is imperative to get them to train correctly!<br /><br />These products are listed as wheat and corn free, which is good if your dog has these specific food allergies. That said, if your dog doesn't have these specific allergies, not a big deal. The good news: all ingredients are natural, made in the USA, and the products contain no artificial favors or colors. Overall, a pretty good training treat!

review/text: This soup is very tasty. The broth has almost a bit of "spicy" taste to it. Easy to prepare, and filling. My wife and daughter like this soup as well. Sometimes I even prepare it in the morning and bring it to work for lunch in a stainless Thermos. What happens is that the Ramen noodles absorb all of the broth and you end up with flavored Ramen noodles...very tasty! The negative about this product is that it is fairly high in sodium, and the flavoring is not all natural. But for an occasional meal, why not?

Slurping your food has a bit of a negative image in the west but trust me that's the way to eat these.<br /><br />I was initially an original and beef flavor only fan of Sapporo Ichiban but for some reason the Miso really took hold of me after eatting a few over the months. It's high in sodium so it's not a great everyday item but if you like ramen you can't go wrong with Sapporo Ichiban Miso flavor.

review/text: I like the 3.5oz size, but I can get 3.0oz packages of competitive brands much cheaper at the local grocery, and the taste isn't much different to me. I'd expect a better price buying in bulk.
