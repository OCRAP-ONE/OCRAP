review/summary: Great tasting, organic tomatoes delivered to the front door
review/text: What's not to like?  Price is at/below local supermarket and Amazon delivers the case right to the door.  USe Muir Glen exclusively (esp. since it's available from Amazon).  Their foods taste fresh and the addition of the garlic (although quite light) is a nice touch.  A winner.

review/text: It's a great product. I take them with me to Mexican restaurants, and my friends think I'm a freak. Still, they really like them. While I do have an allergy to corn, there's not enough of it to trigger an allergic reaction (luckily).  My friends and others are initially suspicious, but are surprised when they taste them.

review/summary: A Gluten-Free Staple...
review/text: In some ways it bothers me the way I depend on Lundberg Family Farms products for so much of my daily food...if it weren't for this company this celiac would've starved to death by now!<br />These chips are absolutely wonderful, fantastic, and delicious!!! They are great on the road. They are a staple of my diet, as there is not much I can safely eat with my "truckload" of food allergies. If I had a complaint, it would be that they don't make the bags in any size larger than 6oz...Frankly 6oz. doesn't go very far for the $. That's why I'm so grateful to be able to get them through Amazon. Otherwise, I'd be much more hungry more often!

review/summary: Wasabi Pretty Good
review/text: I liked these chips a lot. Reasonably priced, relatively healthy, and taste pretty good.  The chips have great textrue and are quite crunchy.  The wasabi flavor is good but a little bit on the mild side (not too surprising since the chip has to appeal to a lot of different palettes). The chips can sometimes be dense and crumbly so they're not always great for dipping.  Overall a very unique chip that I will be getting again.

review/text: I am gluten intolerant, so my choice in chips is limited, not to mention that most of the gluten-free chips don't taste that good.  These chips are truly delicious.  Of course they're not health food, but what chips are?  And they're not organic either, but I've never found a chip that is gluten-free and organic that tastes really good.  I have to say that I love these chips.  I've tried some of the other flavors by the same company, and by far the Sea Salt is my favorite.

review/text: These are such good chips! Most rice chips are bland or have bad texture. These chips are crunchy and so tasty--a nice thick chip that is great for thick dips like hummus or peanut butter. We bring a bag to our local mediterranean place to use for hummus instead of pita bread (gluten allergy). Seriously, these chips are great. I buy them buy the case because our whole family loves to snack on them. Subscribe and save makes us save even more. I love lundberg products generally (try their gluten free cous cous), but their rice chips are my favorite.

review/text: I came across Lundberg Rice Chips at health food stores.  But...the price was at least $3.49 a bag and sometimes they wouldn't have the sea salt ones in stock.

I was excited to find that I could get a case through Amazon with free super saver shipping.

review/text: I'm always on the lookout for a good, natrual chip to snack on. Not that I don't love Doritos or cheese curls, but those chemically-boosted flavors tend to overwhelm my palette. Lately I've been investigating the world of natural "junk food". My only nod to the mainstream manufacturers is to stock the Frito Lay corn chips (fritos). They're corn, oil, and salt. And they're tasty.<br />But I digress...<br />Lundberg's Nacho Cheese chips are fantastic, certainly keeping my palette interested when I'm in a training routing and have to cut out most complex carbohydrates.

review/summary: Best gluten-free item out there!
review/text: I don't usually take the extra time to write reviews, but felt I should for this product because these chips are SO good and have been a lifesaver for my family (we're all gluten-free). As a general rule, we just avoid packaged foods, but the kids eat these chips for snack quite frequently, and my husband and I love them, too. They remind me a little bit of Bugles (the corn chip things), only without the nastiness. For those who have corn sensitivities (we do), these have masa corn in them, which our naturopath says is a different thing than regular corn and won't cause problems. Yummy. Only complaint I can think of is that they could pack more into a bag...there's a lot of air. The price on Amazon is significantly less than what we pay for these in the grocery store, so we order them in bulk every few weeks.

review/summary: Green tea quick and easy
review/text: This is the best green tea I have run across, cause they say we got a drink it, you know? It has a fresh mild taste, but does not have that grassy taste like you're drinking something that was part of your lawn. Therefore you can drink a bunch of these through the day without upsetting your stomach like with coffee. I think the instant hot water makes it taste better than tea bags in the microwave. A box shows up really fast UPS if you have Prime Shipping. Good stuff.

review/summary: Green tea Bigelow
review/text: I used to use Bigelows green tea in tea bags. After purchasing  a Keurick Kcup machine I finally found their Kcups on Amazon . For me this tea is just right at 12 oz. If I want it a little stronger I just cut back on water. A little squirt of lime juice makes it perfect. I receive my orders from Amazon fast, as I have 2day shipping. I will continue to use Amazon and Bigelow tea in future.

review/text: One word:  YUM!!  I will never drink coffee again. It is subtle, refreshing and benefecial to your health.  It tastes great with two packs of sugar or sweet n low and coffee creamer.  Green tea is also very beneficial to your health (cancer fighting agents).  For the Keurig machine, I recommend doing the small cup- to get all of the flavor.  When I chose a medium cup, a lot of the tea seasoning was lost.  We go through this stuff like candy in our office YUM YUM YUM :)

review/text: I am a fairly sophisticated tea drinker and I prefer good Taiwanese green tea (which is 100 times better than tea from China).  This particular k-cup is o.k. but it is more of a Japanese green tea like flavor (darker green).  If you like a good cup of Japanese tea then this is o.k.  I have not found any good k-cup green tea but again even these are much better than Lipton.

review/summary: Is the cost justified????
review/text: I have been using the Bigelow Green Tea Bags with my Keurig machine.  Bigelow Green Tea Bags provide great taste.  And when you buy in quanity with the subscribe and save option the cost is a fraction of the cost for the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.  I use the Keurig machine solely to get the hot water to brew the tea.  I have not tried the K-Cup Bigelow Green Tea, but I am wondering if the taste using the K-Cups justifies the much greater cost?  I am giving a 3 rating since I do not think the cost would be justifed to use the K-Cups in comparison the the Bigelow Green Tea Bags.  I welcome feedback from individuals who have tried the Bigelow Green Tea and the Bigelow Green Tea K-Cups.<br />Please read my updated comment.  I tried the K-Cup Variety and found no difference in taste between the K-Cup and tea bag variety.

review/text: I bought this for a dachshund/lab mix. He would only chew it IF I was trying to take it several time. The flavor just wasn't there for him to be interested. So I boiled some chicken broth and waited for it to cool a smidgen and let the nylabone sit in it for 15 minutes. I let it cool completely and now he's happy chewing! I have been watching him closely to make sure he doesn't eat plastic but he's doing great chewing. If you can't get your dog to enjoy it, I suggest trying that.

review/text: These were well worth ordering because the Melba Toast was Not the best choice for me on the hCG diet.<br />Have enjoyed them now very much for the past 4 weeks and only disappointment has been that the bread sticks<br />arrived, shall we say, not intact.  Been through 3 boxes in which every bread stick was broken but still<br />delicious.

review/summary: Nice Crunch with Great Garlic Flavor
review/text: I bought these as part of a diet I was following, and found them to be delicious!  Since you get a whole case, I gave a box to several members of my family and they also thought they were great.  Some break during shipping but overall, they were not especially damaged.  On a diet or off, these are very tasty!

review/summary: good but all broken!
review/text: For the diet i was on, i needed this type of breadstick. I like the garlic flavor. Very good.<br />The drawbacks were that i had to order 12 boxes..a bit much....and hardly any of the breadsticks were whole. I know they had to be shipped, but it was a bummer that they were broken.

review/text: This product got such rave reviews but I was not impressed at all.  It definitely was not what I expected, the flavor was bland.  I prefer the stella dora breadsticks and will not be ordering these again.

review/summary: Great for HCG type diets but watch for allergens
review/text: This is a recommended product as a snack during the HCG type diets and from my nutritionist. The product shipped quickly and is a great price. But...<br />yes, few of the sticks survived unbroken. But that isnt a big deal to me. What wasnt stated in the description and ingredient list was that these are produced in a facility using sesame, milk, egg, and peanuts. I am unable to safely eat these so gave them to my husband who is not dieting but loves the crunch and mild garlic flavor.

review/summary: Pretty good breadsticks
review/text: I bought these while attempting the HCG diet (I lasted 2 weeks, lol) and these breadsticks are the reason I made it past 3 days. I didn't give them 5 stars because they taste burnt a lot, and almost all of them are broken, but beyond that, they're pretty good. I didn't care that they were broken at all but others may. I recommend these for anyone on the HCG diet, and wish you a lot better luck than I. I still have these, and still eat them periodically (almost daily). They're a great snack. I may even purchase another box after these finish because I really do enjoy them as a low calorie snack. If they could just get rid of that burnt taste they'd be perfect.

review/summary: Will select the right ones next time
review/text: I ordered these before and they were fantastic. Ordered them again and I selected the "Garlic" instead of "It" type. The Garlic is thicker and many of them were broken. The It type are skinny and a little crunchier and come in individual packages. Not going to pay to send them back, but will be sure to select the right ones next time.

review/summary: Pretty good for a green tea.
review/text: I mostly drink traditional black teas. I've tried a few green teas, and for the most part, have been disappointed with their flavor. I like this green tea. It has a nice hint of lemony flavor (from lemongrass) which is not too overpowering. It's also supposed to contain a peach flavor but I didn't really notice it at all.  I'm not sure about the "rejuvenation" claims. That's pretty bold to claim, but heck, if it rejuvenates you then great.

review/summary: The best Yogi green tea
review/text: I have really been into Yogi tea and trying them all! I have all the green teas and after a month of testing them I conclude that this one tastes the best. Most say the Simply Green tastes the best but to me it was far too boring. I got used to all the special herbs and natural flavors and the Simply Green had none added. This one tastes great like a slight peachy lemon natural flavor. I do not like the artifical flavors at all nor do I like the artifical sweet taste added by too much stevia leaf. This tea is the perfect green tea flavor.<br /><br />The Super Anti-Oxidant variety of tea tastes good except for the licorice. The licorice is okay in the bedtime and calming teas but does not taste right in green tea. The Kombusha tea is also great but it has a berry taste, which is good and natural, but I prefer the lemon flavor of this tea. The Slim Life tea is also very good but it does have a blueberry flavor to it, but it is worlds better then the Fasting tea, which tastes the worst of all the Yogi teas. I just love the Yogi tea positive messages don't you?<br /><br />Wise quotes from Yogi Tea by Yogi Bhajan<br /><br />"The universe is the stage on which you dance, guided by your heart."<br /><br />"The purpose of life is to enjoy every moment."<br /><br />"Delight the world with compassion, kindness and grace."<br /><br />"Laugh because that is your purpose in life."<br /><br />Happiness is every human beings birthright."<br /><br />"Be happy so long as breath is in you."<br /><br />"Real happiness lies in that which never comes nor goes, but simply is."<br /><br />"Travel light, live light, spread the light, be the light."<br /><br />"Your greatness is not what you have, it's what you give."<br /><br />"Practice kindness, mercy and forgiveness."<br /><br />"Bliss cannot be disturbed by gain or loss."<br /><br />"Compassion has no limit.

review/summary: best tea i've ever drunk
review/text: My wife and I both love this tea.  We each have anywhere from one to three cups an evening and have done for years.  The tea tastes wonderful (with none of the barn floor flavor of some green teas).  It's chockablock with antioxidant and anticancer ingredients.  Best of all you just plain feel better after a cup of this stuff.  I'm not sure what the action is, but it settles my stomach, gives me a feeling of well-being and energizes me.  Try it, you'll like it.

review/text: Taste great with a slight hint of peach.  I dont usually like peach flavored things, but even I liked that.  i accidentally let it steep for like 20 min once and it got a little bitter, but it's still delicate if you leave the bag in for up to 10 min.

review/summary: A really nice cup of green tea
review/text: This makes a really nice, smooth, refreshing, pleasant cup of tea. When I really need rejuvenating, I still reach for the coffee. But when I want a quiet moment with a nice cup, this fills the bill very well<br /><br />If I ever do decide to give up coffee, I'll be reaching for this a lot. It's not a coffee substitute, but it is refreshing and fills the need for a break and a quick recharge.<br /><br />A very nice tea.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: This is just another in a long line of terrific yogi teas. I usually keep a teapot full of this tea and add it to my (orange juice based) smoothie in the morning - it adds a nice hint of mint.<br /><br />I recently read that adding a citrus juice to green tea multiplies the benefits of the antioxidants in the tea - this tea goes very well with orange juice.

review/summary: greater version of togi's kombucha tea
review/text: This tea is delicious. I had liked the "Kombucha" yogi makes, and this is very similar, but better.  It still has kombucha, but the mint flavor is just a tad stronger, which makes it taste more refreshing.  The tea wakes up my brain and helps me study, and is the perfect cure for the morning after a long night out.  The little bit of caffeine also helps me stay awake at work -- I drink about 3 throughout each day. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best Chocolate Rum Cake Ever!!
review/text: I recently received one of these cakes as a gift.  Normally, I am very skeptical of cakes because I have a friend that makes the best cakes in town.  However, my first piece of Wicked Jack's Tavern Chocolate Rum Cake was pure bliss!!  It's perfect!  There is no frosting/glaze, just the right amount of rum; it's moist and melts in your mouth.  :)  I'm requesting this for my next birthday.  Good job to the team at WJT!!
