review/summary: Choking hazard
review/text: I bought these mini bones for my 10 pound chug and he loved them, That is UNTIL he started choking on the bone.  The bones seem to crumble once bitten into , the pieces fit in the mouth and make it hard for them to chew.  When he tried to chew it it kept slipping and getting loged into his throat. Good thing I was home to watch him or he could have choked to death! Never will buy again. Love my dog too much to take chances..

review/summary: Want a red mess on your carpet?
review/text: My dog got an hour's pleasure out of a single bone. Thankfully she ate it on a towel that happened to be on the floor. It left a six inch square of red 'stuff' on the towel. Dogfood thrown up ususally leaves an indelible mark on my beige carpet.<br /><br />If the manufacturer had just tinted the ends of the 'marrow' red, it would likely have been fine.<br /><br />If you have light colored carpet, BEWARE.

review/summary: Dangerous Choking Hazard
review/text: My 30 lb. male corgi nearly died from eating this. The thing broke in half and became lodged across the roof of his mouth and in his teeth at the back of his mouth. It took over a hour with a pair of channel locks to get it dislodged from his mouth. It was the small/medium size bone. Purina makes a lot of good dog products but this is not one of them. I called Purina and reported the lot number and what had happened. I just dont want anyone else's dog to choke on this thing.

review/summary: Dog loves but it is messy
review/text: I have a 10 month old Weimaraner that loved the Busy Bone Chewbone treat. He has some separation anxiety and they can help keep him calm. It takes him about 15-20 minutes to eat but it is long enough for him to calm himself down. I just make sure he keeps it off white stuff. The red  center bleeds a little if he drops the wet side down or a piece gets broken off and falls on a light surface.  My dog will chew on one end then leave it if he gets distracted then come back and chew on the other end and the wet side dies surface he is on. I have been able to clean it out of stuff easily enough but it is a little bit of a annoying that I have to. I also wish they were cheaper.<br />Update: Now only a 3 star. I got my dog one as a treat on Easter and he did not want to eat. He wanted to bury it. Now normally he only hides treats he is not overly thrilled with aka Milk bones. Since I was by family we did not let him go outside with so he tried to hide it in the storage boxes in the basement eventually after we blocked off the good places to hide or bury it he laid down and ate it but he stopped eating it as soon as we started filling his bowl.

review/text: Hill's Science Diet Puppy Small & Toy Breed dog food provides precisely balanced nutrition to meet your small breed dog's special needs.It is the only brand with an exclusive blend of clinically proven antioxidants.This formula is specially designed to boost immune defenses and support the long life expectancy of small and toy breed dogs.<br />There a myths that allergies are caused by ingredients such as corn but that is not the case. To say that something is a filler would imply it has no nutritional value; when in fact corn is a superb source of nutrients. There is a misconception that whole corn is used - in fact the corn is baked and is much like ground corn you buy. When cooked it is highly digestible.We hear many concerns about by-products in pet food. We need to understand how they are defined and what they really are and what is their nutrient value.<br />By-products is really a play on words. Virtually all ingredients in pet foods are by-products. No one for example uses real chicken breasts as we know it.It's neck and backs of a chicken.<br />Another common myth is that meat should always be the first ingredient, inferring that if that was the case, there would be more meat than anything else in the food. Often the carbohydrates levels are higher than the meats because of the way they are listed in the ingredient panel.Meat first is often the first ingredient only to please the consumer look st the ash levels and mositure levels, and ingreident spliting.<br /><br />I have fed Science Diet to my two dogs and I am very happy with the results. They love the food, it seems to have a good nutrient profile, my dogs have not had any gas or loose stool, in fact the clean up has been minimal so far, poop is much smaller and less of it that ever! I keep searching the yard with the scooper several times a day and there just isn't much to clean up! I can honestly say that they are going HALF as much as they were before! I never would have believed it, considering that there is a considerable amount of corn in these formulas.<br />My dogs were itching, had greasy coats and dandruff all at the same time! I was frustrated and worried for them...after a relatively short time, one of the dogs has virtually stopped itching and the other has decreased her itching intensity.<br /><br />I do wish the food was less expensive.

review/summary: Expected More...
review/text: I received my first bag via a coupon from BzzAgent, for free... since price was not a factor I was more than open to seeing positive changes. I really wanted to give this a high rating because our little mutt really seemed to like eating it and it is the perfect size but I did not notice any positive changes in her. By the same token, I did not notice any major negative changes either. However, the first few days she had diarrhea and after that it went back to almost normal consistency but she was pooping about twice as often. She was also thirsty all the time while eating this.<br /><br />I would say this food is average in quality, the pooch liked the taste but did not experience any of the claimed improvements so I do not think the price is justified. Others may have better luck with it but it just did not work better than our old food.

With her old dog food we would feed her in the morning and she wouldn't never want to eat until later in the day. Now since we have  switched she is real excited when we are getting the food out, she eats it right away.

It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.

review/text: i tried this coffee for the first time overseas, and i was hooked! yes it is a superfine grind and brews up veryyyy strong, but i use about a Tablespoon for about 12-14 oz of coffee. it has a strong, but delicious, cardamon flavor...sweeten with creamer and add a bit of sugar and it is one of the most finest, pure, authentic arab coffee around! there is no artificial flavors in here...they actually grind up the cardamon with the coffee. i def suggest trying this out on a smaller scale before heading in with the 8 pack...you will def find yourself oming back for more. i purchased this coffee from abroad and bring back about 5 each time so i can savor the taste throughout the year. everyone who i serve the coffee to rnjoys it!

review/summary: white chocolate mochas!
review/text: I noticed that i started to make Starbucks runs just to grab their delicious white chocolate mocha but paying close to 5 dollars per trip got me thinking if i could somehow make this at home.  I initially bought this white mocha and then intended to search for a good coffee to pair it with but honest.. this stuff is AMAZING!  Even combining it with Folgers instant coffee can give you a taste that is very similar to starbucks... which makes me question the coffee at starbucks and makes me realize it's more about what you add into your coffee.  I heard somewhere that starbucks pumps 4 pumps of this into your drink and 4 pumps is pretty sweet and delicious.  BUY IT.  I'm almost out and ordering two more to get a little more value with the shipping.

I have been told by several Starbucks employees to buy Fontana as this was the brand/label that was in their stores years ago.

review/text: Been experimenting with a couple of white chocolate sauces from the grocery and finally tried this one.  I've tried 3 pumps on 6-8 oz of milk split between 2 small espresso (1 shot each) and that turned out to be the perfect drink for me.  Experiment a couple time to suit your taste, also play with the espresso shots.  I use Lavazza or Illy for my espresso and I have been very pleased with the results.<br /><br />Definitely reduced my trip to the coffee shops.  And who likes to go get a white chocolate mocha anywhere when you first wake up in your jammies? I see people who do but I know I don't!  So having this little gem at home is a real treat!  Also, I don't know if it's supposed to be refrigerated but I do and I didn't notice a difference in the consistency.

review/text: I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.  I also use them as a pie crust.  I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc.

review/summary: Product shipped and arrived quicky... the cookies in each of the bags were in pieces.
review/text: I order two (2) cases of cookies on the same Amazon order. A case of Ginger Snaps and case of Chocolate Cookies from another manufacture.  Both cases arrived quickly from Amazon.  But the ginger snaps had many bags where nearly the entire bag of cookies were broken up and in pieces.  The other case of cookies (Chocolate Chip) was perfect, Hardly any of them broken.

review/summary: They are GINGER SNAPS so they better be spicy!
review/text: I like all the gluten free flavors of cookies that Mi-Del makes.  These are a perfect ginger snap.  Yes, they are crunchy and spicy, but that is what I expect in a ginger snap.  They are wonderful to dip in milk.  The milk cools the spiciness and softens the cookie.  My kids like them so much I have to hide them if I want some left for later!

review/summary: Center of cookie is rock hard
review/text: The outer layer of the cookie is good but the center is far from creamy. It's rock hard and inedible IMO. I bought these and after eating a couple they sat in our pantry until they went stale and were tossed. I won't buy these again. However MI-DEL makes other cookie varieties that are delicious--my whole family loves the GF arrowroot animal cookies and the GF ginger snaps.

review/summary: The way the cookie crumbles
review/text: These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again.

review/summary: Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

review/text: The cookie part is ok, but the filling is not good at all. It is dry and splinters apart when bitten into. The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The "chocolate" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as "bite-size," they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.

review/text: I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.

review/summary: Great cookies!
review/text: My grandson's gluten allergy led me to these cookies because animal cookies are a tradtional Christmas gift for children in our family. Our entire family loves them, but the real test is on unsuspecting gluten consuming individuals and they past the test. Recently the contractor came by in the afternoon with his son's 8 and 10 years old.  They looked hungry and so I offered cookies, with Dad's permission.  They almost wiped out the bag. Good Cookies!

review/summary: Animal Crackers Sure To Please.
review/text: These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard.

Both taste fine and I find I can't put the box down sometimes, but I am not a big sugar/butter cookie fan, so I think I prefer the Envirokidz. Definitely a better deal than the local health food store and, trust me, you WILL be able to eat the whole box before they expire.

They are perfect for school snack or in the car.  The cookies are tasty enough that Mom and Dad (who do eat wheat) will snack on them as well.  They are quite pricey in the store, but Amazon's subscription price makes them fairly affordable - and much easier than always making homemade.

review/summary: Husky Loves It!!
review/text: My husband and I have had a hard time finding good distracters for our husky puppy (~1 year old this month).  This definitely kept him entertained for a long period of time.  It lasted much longer than other raw hide we had given him.  I can't give a specific time frame, because we'd let him chew on it for 15-45 minutes and then take it away.  He never got bored with it and was always happy to see it come out of his box!  My husband was impressed with how well it was wrapped and how it was made in a way that it was hard for him to bit off big chunks and swallow whole (one of the dangers of raw hide).  Overall, I'll definitely be ordering more.  We are on #3 of these!  I think the first two were "natural" but I wanted to give this one a try because of the added glucosame; I'm sure he doesn't need it, as a puppy, but from the sources I found, it can't hurt.

review/summary: My cats favorite treats.
review/text: Normally, when we've brought home cat treats, one or two of our three cats will like them, and one or two won't. They're picky.<br /><br />With Greenies, they all go bonkers. We just need to start opening the bag and all three come running. It's become a reliable way to track them all down.<br /><br />One of them has figured out how to open the cabinet we used to keep them in, so we've had to get more creative about hiding them. The contortions he goes through to open the cabinet are incredible. Naturally when he finds a bag he opens it himself, and he doesn't use the zip lock seal, or follow the recommended limit of no more than six treats at a time.<br /><br />Try a small bag to see if your cats like them, but I'm now buying them in bulk.<br /><br />They like them better than catnip.

This is the first time I have order from Tao of Tea and only did so because Davidson's did not have it available on here at this time. I will not order Tao of Tea again. I received my product and it seemed stale and was nothing but shake. When you get Chamomile tea it should be flowers not shake. Every time I have ordered Davidson's chamomile it has been wonderful. I would suggest you pass on this brand and get Davidson's if it is available. I believe it is even a little bit cheaper too from Davidson's which is an added bonus.

review/summary: Definitely not true posole corn and not what I expected...
review/text: I ended up throwing it all way -- all 25 lbs of my order after I used a few pounds of it to make my grandmother's recipe for posole. It just wasn't TRUE posole. Although it resembled the creamy white kernels in appearance (except the kernels were a bit rounded and too fat at the germ), the taste was completely wrong.  It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't posole and I couldn't eat it. I believe this corn is used for Ecuadorean food -- definitely not Mexican -- and certainly not posole. What a disappointment that this company (who does have lovely offerings on their web site) is passing this product off, perhaps unintentionally, as something it certainly isn't. Yeah, I should have tried to return it, but I was so disgusted. It took me a while to get my perspective back -- I mean, it was only corn... I'm better now...  :]
