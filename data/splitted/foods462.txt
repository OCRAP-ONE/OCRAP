review/text: I am what might be called a "lazy cook".  Most recipes totally<br />faize me, and the clean-up afterwards, (what with a broken<br />dishwasher in my home at present), makes the idea of creaing<br />meals for myself even more distasteful.<br /><br />But ravioli?  Like other pasta dishes, it's even easy for ME<br />to prepare.  1) Put frozen ravioli, (or other pasta product,<br />into a Pasta Express or other large container which has a<br />lid. (I like using 32 ounce zip-lock containers.)  2) Pour<br />boiling water into said container, to cover ravioli or other<br />pasta product, and more, stopping at about 1/2 inch from lid.<br />3) Cover container.  (If using a zip-lock container, leave<br />one of the four locking corners OPEN.  Or two of the locking<br />corners open -- slightly.)  3) Wait 45 minutes to an hour,<br />or until most if not all of the water is absorbed by the<br />ravioli or other pasta product.  4) Drain away excess water.<br />5) Put into dish, and cover with desired sauce, and cheese,<br />if any.....<br /><br />Voila!  Ravioli!  (Or other pasta product!)  However, there<br />is DEFINITELY ONE THING which this Chef Boyardi Beef Ravioli<br />14.25-ounce, Microwavable Bowl, (or most other similar 14 or<br />more microwavable bowl products) can do, that "semi-homemade"<br />ravioli cannot do.  And that is............ONCE THE BOWL IS<br />EMPTY, YOU CAN WASH, RINSE AND DRY IT THOROUGHLY, THEN<br />TURN THE CAP, OVER.  AND USE AS A SOAP DISH!  I personally<br />like the YELLOW cap of the this item, rather than the red<br />caps of similar items -- but it's your choice.  Those little<br />HOLES in the plastic cap, that allow microwaving, make<br />dandy drainers for soap!  And if -- like me -- you find the<br />soap doesn't drain or dry fast enough with just these little<br />holes, you can, (as I have done), cut into the four little<br />holes, (carefully!), to make one big hole!  You have enjoyed<br />the pasta, and now you are enjoying savings, by not having<br />to buy a soap dish!<br /><br />NOTE: I do NOT own a microwave, and so I eat this yummy<br />ravioli cold.  (Warming it up in a saucepan, you see, would<br />entail the extra washing-up of that saucepan -- something I<br />do NOT want to do.)  However, since I have never microwaved<br />this item, I don't know what, (if anything), microwaving<br />might do to the pretty yellow lid of this item.  IF micro-<br />waving damages or makes the lid unusuable for a soap-dish<br />drainer, my advice is to get ONE bowl, and either heat the<br />contents up in a saucepan, (with the attending washing-up),<br />or eat the contents oold, as I have.  (It's quite delicious<br />this way, as well.)<br /><br />For even more savings, buy just TWO Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli<br />14.25 ounce bowls, or similar product in similar size bowls.<br />Then, afterwards, you can have TWO soap-dishes -- and use each<br />one alternately, for even more drying of each now even MORE long-<br />lasting cake of soap!<br /><br />If you don't like to keep looking at the somewhat truly attract-<br />ive bowl covering, you can always remove it.  Use the bowl<br />plain, ((mine was white on the outside), or decorate it with<br />stick ons of your favourite people, places, or things!<br /><br />So, unless you are not only a lazy chef like me -- but a super-<br />duper lazy chef -- my recommendation would be to buy TWO, (and<br />ONLY two) of these Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli, or simiar prod-<br />uct, in 14.25 ounce, (or close to that size), bowls, at your<br />local supermarket.  As far as I can see, buying a pack of 12<br />here on Amazon is, sadly, totally unnecessary -- unless, as I<br />have said, you are not only a lazy chef-- but a super-duper<br />lazy chef.<br /><br />However, not buying THIS particular product on Amazon should<br />NOT stop you from buying OTHER bargains on Amazon!  In fact,<br />you can, (as I have), take a blank sticker, write, "AMAZON<br />FOREVER!" on it, stick it carefully on one of the bowls of<br />your new soap dish, and enjoy it, along with other home-made<br />stickers of favourite sayings or pictures!<br /><br />Of course, if you REALLY like this product a lot, you CAN<br />always treat yourself to buying a dozen of them, from Amazon,<br />on special occasions, like your birthday or wedding, or other<br />anniversary, etc.!  Or, you might want to get together with<br />six friends, and each of you can make a set of soap-dishes<br />from the dozen offered here on Amazon.  Whatever way you<br />choose to enjoy this delightfully delicious product --<br />BON APPETITE!!!!

review/text: My husband and I picked up a bag of these the other day and they are already gone! Even though these are made by Mars an American company we haven't found these in the US, we actually bought ours in Germany.<br /><br />We have both been fans of Almond Joy(milk chocolate, coconut, almonds) and Mounds(DARK chocolate, coconut) in the past but these are better! I don't really know why these are better, perhaps more of a fresh coconut taste and better chocolate?? Either way these are awesome! If you like Almond Joy, Mounds, or just chocolate and coconut you will LOVE these!<br /><br />We really hope these become more popular so they sell them in more US stores.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Like Mounds on Steroids, only Milk Chocolate and not dark<br />-These come in Dark Chocolate too!<br />-Really, Really, Really Good!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-On the sweet side, can't eat a lot without getting a tummy ache which could be good for portion control, so perhaps this could be a pro? haha<br />-Not a "healthy" snack, but that's not why we buy these right?<br /><br />Tip: Try putting them in the fridge then consume, mmmmmm :)

But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Tastes just like any of their other cookies
review/text: If you are looking for oatmeal cookies do not buy these as they have the same texture and flavor as Keebler's other cookies. I purchased these in hopes of having delicious oatmeal texture and flavor however what I received by what I could see was a standard keebler cookie with oats on top. Now I know some of you might be thinking, if you find their other cookies appetizing why did you rate it one star? Simply because when I purchase an oatmeal cookie, I expect an oatmeal cookie where the oats are a dominant flavor in the palate. I paid for an oatmeal cookie and I received a repackaged re-branded keebler cookie. The second major reason behind my rating is the packaging is absolutely worthless, if you must buy these purchase a ziplock bag to keep the cookies from going stale or eat them in one sitting.

review/text: I read all the reviews and found myself laughing. The Keebler Elfs have made the same cookies forever! What did people really expect from them! If you are so picky about oatmeal cookies or any cookie, you do not want to get Keebler! I found these to be great for a pick me up with a cup of tea.  I am in my 60's so I know the Keebler Elfs well! They have never let me down! With the poor economy this price is great for my old age. The last time my daughter came to the beach, I went into the food store with her. I picked up a package of Keebler chocolate cookies(14.5ounce) that cost almost $4! As for the package materials, it is not much different than any others. I really feel all cookies should be taken out of original package and put in a COOKIE JAR which is one of life's little pleasures that turns into great memories!  There were only one or two broken but not so that you could not eat. As for the taste, it is really good. Also, it takes care of the need for a little chocolate. With really cold milk or hot tea, I find them wonderful and thank the Elfs and Amanzon!

review/summary: Great for diabetics!!!
review/text: It tastes better than any other Stevia product I have tasted but it still is not as sweet as most artificial sweetners, which can be good or bad depending on your own tastes. I think it does not overpower things as Splenda does with the too sweet taste in things such as tea but for adding to cereal I will stick with Splenda. I guess the final is that it has it's place in line and it is definately right in line with Splenda in my book, each has it's uses that it is best at.<br /><br />Update.... As I have tried other stevia products now I have come to the realization that this is my favorite and I now use it daily. It is good as a sweetener in most anything but I still do my baking with Splenda since it tastes better in baked goods than the stevia. I will say that after you get used to using stevia nad you experiment with how much you really need to use then you won't have the aftertaste that many reviewers complain about, somtimes a whole packet can be a little too much and sometimes it is just not enough...

review/summary: As Close to Sugar as It Gets...
review/text: I've used them all - saccharine, Sweet 'n Low, Equal, and Splenda.  None of these sweetners tasted like sugar, but with a family history of diabetes and obesity, I chose to make that trade-off.  Some of the sweetners were acceptable; some just didn't sweeten enough (Equal), using only one packet, to be cost effective.  Splenda has been my sweetner of choice for the past several years, but it still didn't taste like sugar.<br /><br />One of the warehouse stores was demonstrating PureVia, so my spouse and I tried it.  Imagine how surprised I was to find the taste and texture were as close to granulated sugar as I have encountered in a sweetner.  Even my picky spouse thought he could use this on his cereal in the morning - instead of several tablespoons of sugar.  I used PureVia in my coffee this morning.  PureVia was truly as close to sugar as I have found - one packet was sufficient and the coffee tasted great!  We did find that PureVia did not dissolve well in iced tea; again, it performed very much like sugar when that sweetner is put into cold tea.<br /><br />If you use some type of artificial sweetner, then you should definitely consider PureVia.  The per packet cost is higher than the other artificial sweetners when compared on a one-to-one basis.  For example and in my opinion, one packet of PureVia sweetens as much as one packet of Sweet 'n Low, three packets of Equal, and two packets of Splenda.  However, factoring in the requirement to use multiple packets of most of the other sweetners and the superior taste of PureVia, I think it is clearly the best sweetner available.  I will be switching to PureVia as my sweetner of choice and recommend it to anyone who also uses sweetners instead of sugar.

review/summary: Like it Better Than Truvia
review/text: I've never been a fan of stevia until they started mixing it with other natural sweeteners to make it more palatable. I've tried them all (I think) and I live the PureVia much better than the main competitor, Truvia.<br /><br />I use it to make limonadas and on fresh fruit and find that it tastes quite like sugar. I used to use 100% erythritol, but it takes so much of that to sweeten anything that the cost is prohibitive. With 2-3 packets of Purevia (I like my beverages VERY sweet), I'm fine.<br /><br />Definitely a better price than buying the 40 packet boxes at the grocer.

review/summary: Found a better sweetener!
review/text: Because I drink a lot of coffee and sweetened iced tea, I've been searching for a better low-cal sweetener ...healthier than chemicals aspartame [nutrasweet] or sucrolose [splenda] even though I've had no apparent ill effects from either of them  After some research & trusted recommendations, I thought the solution was stevia. I tried both liquid stevia drops and Truvia which, for me, had an aftertaste hinting of licorice [which I dislike], then found Sun Crystals - a low-cal blend of stevia and sugar, which was quite satisfactory...but it was discontinued due, I understand, to low sales! Tried the PureVia which I like just fine..no aftertaste! Available through Amazon Subscribe & Save [as is my coffee] - an Amazon service I LOVE for its economy and convenience

review/summary: Unpleasant to say the least
review/text: I drink a lot of iced tea but not if it isn't sweet.  I thought these individual packets would be good for adding to my tea and I'm glad to have something that won't spike my insulin levels.  One packet is worth about two sugar packets so be careful how much you use.  I think sugar tastes good, aspartame tastes good, sucralose (e.g. Splenda) tastes good, saccharin tastes good (when you don't overdo it) but this was just weird.  It was sweet for sure, but it seems like most of the sweetness didn't register until a few seconds later.  I also registered an almost bitter taste, but just for a split second with each sip.  It's really hard for me to explain, but I'll just say I had no desire to finish the rest of my iced tea.<br /><br />I tried it again later and did a few experiments with it.  First, I poured a little on my finger and tasted it by itself.  Again I thought it had kind of an odd taste and slightly bitter.  I poured a slightly larger portion on my finger and tasted that.  Yuck!  Maybe it's like that because it's sweeter than sugar, but I got the same sensation when I mixed it in my tea.  I also tried adding it gradually to my tea and the best I could do was a neutral flavor.  Once it started to get sweet I could taste that same funny and slightly bitter taste.  Another wasted glass.<br /><br />This is the first stevia product I've tried so I can't say the sweetener itself tastes like this, they do add other ingredients.  If you want to try this product you really need to get the cheapest/smallest that you can.  I'll be throwing out about 95% of this stuff and I'm regretting that I ever used 5% of it.<br /><br />I would, however, recommend agave nectar.  It's a low-calorie sweetener with a low glycemic index and it's natural (usually organic).  It has a smooth taste, a pleasant aftertaste [if any], and even when I use too much it doesn't taste terrible.  I've tried two different brands and I have yet to be disappointed.

It's much more similar to sugar, in both taste and texture. It's more expensive but well worth the cost.

review/summary: Tastes Like the Wrapper (or the Box)...
review/text: The only other stevia product I've tried is TruVia.  It wasn't bad, but it was a little on the expensive side.  At least where I purchased it.  Years ago I used Equal, which I had no problem with, then I switched to Splenda, which I've used for years.  However, the "health" information keeps changing, so I try to give new products a try.  As stated, TruVia wasn't bad.  This (PureVia) however tastes and smells terrible.  It's definitely sweet, but it has a cardboard type odor to it, and that's the exact aftertaste it leaves in your mouth.  Even using one packet in a cup of coffee makes the entire cup of coffee smell and taste like cardboard.  Coffee is a strong smell to overpower, but this stuff does it.  It really has an unpleasant taste and smell.  Sugar, or sugar substitutes, shouldn't add weird tastes to your food.  They should only add sweetness.  And, while this does add sweetness, the terrible taste is too much to overlook, especially with much better options on the market.

I also love that they are made of real food (sweet potatoes), with no additives or fillers, and that they are made in the U.S. rather than China.  They are not as long-lasting a chew as rawhide or tendons, however.  If you are looking for a longer-term doggie pacifier, my recommendation would be a Zuke's Z-Ridge Edible Dental Chew Bone.

review/text: We've been looking for a vegetarian rawhide for our dogs and this is the best yet. Sure it doesn't last hours, but it gives them a good 10-15 minutes of hardcore chewing. My dogs love them and get excited at just the site of the bag. I just wish some local stores carried these so I didn't have to order them all the time.

review/summary: Compared to the competition these are the best (My dogs love these!)
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 2:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>I was purchasing Canyon Creek (and Waggin' Train) yams for my dogs from the pet store.  They loved the taste but I couldn't stand the smell.  The preservative used is a bisulfite (I incorrectly state bisulfate in my review) and it breaks down to sulfur dioxide (one of the smells of burning matches) on standing.  I don't know if they use too much preservative but either way I never liked the thought of so much of it being there.  Although the Canyon Creek came from China I figured how could they screw up yams?  Anyway, I saw these in the store and saw the Made in the USA label and decided to give them a try.  For me they are better in every way, cheaper, no smell, last longer on chewing, better texture, bigger sizes.<br /><br />Some other notes that I forgot to include in the video, they are labeled as vegetable rawhides, they don't last anywhere near as long as a real rawhide.  Maybe a minute for my big dog.  Also some reviewers noted that their dogs either didn't like them or got sick after eating them.  My dogs experience no loose stools or vomiting and they will beg for these treats readily when I go for the bag (obvious in the video when I pull the treat from the bag and he immediately comes up to grab it), but again this depends on the dog.  These treats fit very well with my wish to feed my dogs a quality product whenever price will allow.<br /><br />Edit:  The price on these seems to fluctuate heavily.  When I bought these and wrote the review they were $9.99, that was a good deal for what they are and comparable with the other brands, but at $18.99 a bag I wouldn't really consider them worth it any more and I would buy other treats instead.

review/summary: He loves them, but...
review/text: My dog LOVES these, but he throws up a few hours after eating them.  I thought his system just needed a little time to get used to them, so I kept giving them to him every couple of days.  I was so excited about these because they're veggie, but I don't think I'll be buying them again.  :o(

review/summary: awesome healthy chew for your dog
review/text: I love this product -- we get them for our dog, who has a sensitive stomach.  They are 100 percent yam, no other ingredients, and they're clean (no staining on rugs, no yucky oils, dyes, etc.)  I feel good giving these to my dog because I know that sweet potatoes are loaded with beta carotene and fiber -- it's good for us and good for the pups too!

review/summary: My 4.8lb Chihuahua loves these! So do her doggie friends that live at the vet clinic I work at!
review/text: My Chi girl loves these. She gets excited when she hears the word "potato".<br /><br />They are made in the USA, and are natural. =)<br /><br />Make sure to verify where your pets treats come from, as there are some that were just recalled that were made in China.<br /><br />My little girl was having trouble with "dry stools" (sorry, I know this is gross), but the fiber content in these has dramatically changed that and now she is having healthier stools! So it is a treat that that keeps her occupied for a while and helps her insides to be happier and healthier! The clinic dogs love them as well. As soon as I open up the bag to get one out their noses go straight up and they start sniffing..which leads to begging for one! =) I only give my baby 1 a day, as more than that would exceed her calorie limit for the day, and I think it would lead to loose stools, which no one wants! Ha!

review/summary: Excellent Vegetarian Rawhide
review/text: My dog really loves these Sam's Yams Veggie Rawhide Sweet Potato Dog Treats.  She eats one up so fast I kind of think she will choke, but she just really loves the flavor of these treats.  I have purchased some sweet potato treats for my dog before and she really liked them, so I thought I would give these a try for her.  She finds them even more tasty than the ones I had previously purchased.<br /><br />I like that these are vegetarian rather than beef rawhide.  Beef is OK, but I wanted to get her off so many beef items.  These are a good alternative.  The dehydrated sweet potato makes for an analysis of 6% minimum crude protein and 6% minimum crude fat.  Those levels are in the good range for these treats - I don't want them to get much above those amounts.<br /><br />I love my dog, and these premium treats are the perfect way to reward her, and help clean her teeth.

review/text: My dogs long for a nice mid-day snack before dinner, like most of us, and I struggled to find a chew that was healthy and NOT made in China.  I cannot imagine giving them those horrible plastic-like rawhide chews....they don't even look like they're food, do they??<br /><br />These sweet potato chews are BIG, so don't let the price make you shy away.....I take one treat and break it into 3 pieces so they go much farther (I have cockapoos....larger dogs may require a larger treat)  They are chewy and sometimes they seem to get stuck in their teeth, but better sweet potatoes than plastic, right??  If you have a smaller dog, the Bichon Fries are perfect for you.  2 Paws Up!!

review/summary: Maggots in my bag!!!!
review/text: I have a three year old lasspoo I have given him sweet potato treats before and he loved them. I have heard and read so many great things about sams yams that when I saw them on amazon I got 4 bags super excited. When I got them I opened them up and gave one to my very excited dog he loved it. But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS! I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product! I have pictures !<br /><br />I called the company and left a message since it was after hours I never heard back. Needless to say I returned them to amazon. I wish I could leave a picture on this review to show u all!

review/summary: MMMmmmm....delicious......
review/text: With 5 small dogs who are all on limited diet due to skin issues, finding a treat is a difficult task.  These fit the bill!  They are just hard enough to warrant some good chewing time but will not stain the carpet or leave bad house odors.  The only ONE drawback is just a nature issue....what goes in...must come out.  It does make cleaning the yard much easier since the bright orange sweet potato stands out in the green grass! (too many yams?? LOTS of outside potty time too!) I do like that these are a natural product that my dogs really enjoy.  We use other treats, but giving these once or twice a week works with our treat schedule well.

review/summary: Bear loves non-GMO Sam's Yams!
review/text: My dobe, Bear, has enjoyed Sam's Yams chews, cookies and bones since he was a puppy.  Because Sam's Yams require more focused chewing than typical training treats, the chews, cookies and bones were integral in a training routine to encourage my rambunctious puppy to stay down and calm on our "front porch" as neighbors, kids on bikes and cars moved past.  What began as training has become a ritual which is our favorite part of the day.<br /><br />Recently, at the advice of Bear's vet to address a chronic skin condition, I changed Bear's diet to a single novel protein source and eliminated all GMO ingredients. To that end, I contacted all of the vendors of Bear's treats including, of course, Sam's Yams.  To our delight, Chef David and Sam's Yams sweet potato grower assured us that Sam's Yams do not contain any GMO ingredients.  Happily, Bear's skin condition has resolved and he continues to be one of Sam's Yams greatest fans.

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: I was skeptical- but had to stop giving my dog rawhide because of a health problem and sweet potato is one of the things he's allowed to have, so figured I'd give it a try. He likes regular sweet potato just cooked and mashed ok, but isn't terribly enthusiastic so I was afraid he'd be the same with this. No, he absolutely loves them! Doesn't take him as long to eat as a rawhide but they're still pretty substantial.

review/text: Fast Shipping. This is the first time I ordered this product, although I have bought sweet potato chews for a long time. These chews are much tougher, thicker, and larger than other brands I use. I have small dogs therefore this was not such a good choice as I had to cut the chews into manageable sizes for my dogs. Not a bad product, just made for larger dogs I would say.

review/summary: This treat gets FOUR PAWS UP = our guys LOVE them!
review/text: (This is the same review I posted for the "Big Boyz" size of this product) ...<br /><br />We have three dogs, and one is a bit of a "picky" eater, and I have given Sam's Yams to ALL of them, with no complaints and wagging tails from everyone. I didn't want to have the mess on the rugs (or smell) of real rawhide, and I didn't want to worry about bone chips with regular bone treats. These are our guys' FAVORITE treat, hands down. To make them last longer overall, you can bend and break them into small pieces (which I always do), and simply give them as a smaller treat, vs. giving them the entire 'slice' of sweet potato as they come packaged in the bag. Even though they don't last for hours like a "rawhide" does, I just don't care. I've had my fill of trying to keep the dogs in one tiled area with their chews / bones so that they don't get crud on the carpet or rugs (that I have to clean!). With this product, you have: (1) a super healthy treat (2) something that doesn't have the risk of bone chips (although of course, I don't give them these treats and leave the house -- and I don't do that with any treat) (3) a treat that does NOT stain the carpet or rugs (at ALL!), or rub off or stain your dog's fur (4) a treat that is made from dried sweet potatoes and ONLY that ... no preservatives, no 'animal parts', no artificial colors, no chemicals, no other "mystery" ingredients that you can't identify - just 100% dried sweet potatoes. I've checked around and Amazon seems to have the best price - I recommend these VERY highly (and I would say that our dogs all agree!)

review/text: As a great treat these are lacking but as a chew substitute they are ok. I am trying to bring my dogs along with us in going veterinarian and these will get them by but they don't love them. I have a younger pit who will eat anything... so far so she's game. But my 8 year old pit is not so happy with the treat situation but will eat these after give the other non meat choices.<br /><br />Update! Well we finished the bag and they both are really warming up to the yams as they haven't had any other chews so I am ordering more bags. So I have revised up from 3 to 4 stars.

review/summary: Best Chews Ever!
review/text: I can't say enough about this product!  My dog was sick for 6 months last year, and hospitalized twice.  Her food was changed 4 times, before they figured out she was allergic to just about every kind of meat!  What is a dog to do???  There wasn't anything out there that she could chew on (that she liked).  She wouldn't touch non-food toy chews, so she took to finding paper(or a book) and chewing/shredding it whenever she could get away with it.  I was going out of my head!  Sam's Yams was a God-send!  She loves them and can't wait to get one.  She gets so excited when she knows I'm getting one for her, and then can't find a place to chew it...it's funny, she circles the house looking for a good hide-out, afraid someone will take it from her.  The best part is...they aren't making her sick!  I highly recommend these, as well as the Big Boyz version of the chew. My dog is a Cavapoo, size of a Cocker, and it takes her about 5-10 minutes to polish one off.  That is the only downer...wish it lasted longer.  But hey, beggers can't be choosers!!

review/summary: 1 out of 3
review/text: I bought these thinking they would be good and healthy for my terrier mix and he would enjoy them.  I was wrong.  After trying for a week, he wanted nothing to do with them. He prefers his Dingo rawhide bones.  I gave one to a friend's dog, a lab, who usually eats absolutely anything and everything, but surprisingly, she, too, after a couple of attempts wanted nothing to do with these.  Then, I gave one to my sister who has a rat terrier to see if he liked them.  At first he didn't, but after a day or so, he now loves them!  He must even like the smell of sweet potato because my sister says he even rolls on them!  So my experience says 1 out of 3 dogs will enjoy these sweet potato treats.

review/text: These are great. They won't cure cancer or solve world hunger, but they're good dragees.<br /><br />One complaint: They arrived in a plain, unlabelled plastic container. The legal disclaimer on the page here says (paraphrasing) "Don't trust this web page, trust the product packaging, for ingredients, etc." But there is no product packaging, no label.

One bag alone with several is a little upsetting.

review/summary: Graham crackers good enough for Mommy to eat too!
review/text: I LOVE these graham sticks.  They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:).  I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot.  As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best.  For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey.  They don't have anything "scary" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners.  Just vitamins and natural, organic products.

review/summary: Taste and smell were intolerable.
review/text: I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them.

review/summary: Titan Loves his ZiwiPeak Venison!
review/text: This stuff is so worth it, and when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.  You see, it's raw air dried venison, and it comes in these little compact squares about the size of a dime of venison jerky.  But it's still soft, almost velvety, as it is still raw.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is high quality.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.

review/summary: Amazing For Finicky Eaters and Stomach Issues
review/text: If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need.

review/summary: One of the best dog food out there.
review/text: I have a very picky puppy that would often rather starve himself, than to eat something he doesn't like. Because of that, he was becoming underweight and I decided to switch him away from dry kibble to have him gain some weight first before worrying bout his picky taste.<br />However when I give him ziwipeak, he would finish it up right away!<br /><br />This brand is expensive, but based upon the amounts you feed, it isn't really that much expensive if you have a small dog. I have a 2 pound puppy that is expected to mature at about 4-5 pounds, and the costs is about 25cents extra a day. If you have a big dog that's gonna gobble up 1/3 of a bag or more a day, then that will be a lot more expensive for you.<br /><br />But......<br />The quality of food and the fact that it is in a jerky meat form makes it a lot better than eating hard dry kibble all day long.<br />Anyone would be bored of eating biscuits everyday for his entire life :/<br /><br />The quality of this food is unsurpassed.<br />There have been no problems at all with this food at all as well either. No recalls, all made in New Zealand as well.<br /><br />Something that I tell a lot of people.<br />Spend more on food daily, and not risk the possibility of having a sick dog due to some pet food recall. Vet bills are going to cost you a few thousand dollars.<br />Expensive dog food will probably add up to the same cost as most over the duration of your dog's life, unless you have a really big dog.<br />So instead of having to go through the grief of having a puppy in pain, and you undergoing mental and emotional stress, why not just give it a food that is good and safe and something that the dog enjoys, and spare yourself from all that unnecessary trouble?<br /><br />Yes times are hard and most people are having difficulty putting dinner on the table for themselves or their kids. So there are situations where foods like this are just too much to afford.<br />So unless if your budget really is a problem, I would recommend this food to anyone!

review/summary: Looks gross, smells gross, my dog loves it!!!
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this because it costs a fortune and venison and fish sounded pretty unappetizing.  But I was desperate, because I have a 16 year old dog who's always been a picky eater but had now lost a dangerous amount of weight because of a heart condition.  The pet store said this was the tastiest thing they had in stock and they couldn't keep it on their shelves, so despite its $4/can price tag, I decided to try it.<br /><br />The food looks gross.  It has strange-looking pieces in it (tripe? some exotic part of the venison or blue mussel?), and it doesn't smell like something I would want to eat, either.  But my dog cannot get enough of it. She gobbles it up and begs for more.  She's gained back the weight she lost, and feeding her is no longer an excruciating, hour long process of coaxing and pleading.  Unlike some cheaper canned foods I've tried, it does not give her digestive problems.<br /><br />If you have a picky eater and you've tried everything, try Ziwipeak.  Maybe your dog just has a sophisticated palette :-)

review/summary: Great Product - Too Expensive!
review/text: I've tried raw, canned and dry.  Accept for home made, I have yet to find a healthy, processed food that my dogs love as much as this food that is also convenient for me.  It is absent the corn and wheat products that you should avoid.  It is not a totally dry food but comes in a bag and is more dry than wet.  I suggest you also store in the refrigerator.  The four rating is because it is also one of the most expensive products - so much so that I may have to keep searching for a less expensive alternative.  I am also concerned at recent reports that the concentration of too much animal protein in a dog's diet may create organ problems.  If you use this food check for portion size which is less than your usual kibble.  And don't forget to give your four legged friend a sprout of brocolli, chip of sweet potatoe and some other vegetables now and then.  Do your research as there are some foods that should not be fed to your dogs includeing cooked bones which can cause havoc for them.

review/summary: raw fed travel made easier  *BUT*....
review/text: I have a small breed service dog and his raw food diet can be a challenge when we travel. I bought this food based on the fact that it's the closest ingredient-wise to what I'd feed him at home. He loves this food and literally spins in circles when he hears me open the container I store it in, something he has NOT done for other foods in the past.<br /><br />My issue with this food is that when I received the bag I noticed through the window on the back of the package that the lower third of the bag seemed to be mostly crumbs; in transferring the upper portion of the bag to a smaller storage container I found that most of the bottom of the bag was almost "dust". The "dust" makes my dog cough even if he eats slowly; adding a little water to his bowl has helped with this issue.<br /><br />Edited to add: I've added a photo so you can see what winds up in the bowl.<br /><br />Since this was my first bag of ZiwiPeak I'm not sure if this is normal for the brand - at this cost though I feel it shouldn't be. It could be that the product had settled and the heavy weight of the upper product caused the lower portion to settle and break, or maybe this bag just had a really rough time in shipping. Either way, this product makes traveling so much easier and my pup just loves having it at home as a treat so I've ordered a second bag today and will see if the crumb issue repeats itself or not.<br /><br />UPDATE 01/16/12: The second bag (Lamb) was received in perfect condition this time.<br /><br />Would purchase again and recommend.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I finally upgraded to the 11 lb bag after purchasing several 2.2 1b bags. I have two small dogs at home, both are 10 pounds each. I was trying out the raw food diet after doing research online, and while the dogs loved it, I was definitely not a fan of the raw meat and having to wipe everywhere when they were done eating.<br /><br />Along comes Ziwipeak, and I tested out the different flavors in the smaller portions, ALL of which the two dogs loved.<br /><br />Here are the marked differences since switching over (previously they were on Merrick dry food, before that was Halo).<br /><br />Fresh breath, no more doggy odor!<br />Stools do not smell (or very very faint)<br />One of the dogs - a Maltese - her tearstains have completely disappeared!!<br />Glossier coats<br />More energetic<br /><br />Etc etc.<br /><br />So even though this is expensive, in terms of the visible differences you can see in the dogs, I believe it's worth it!

review/summary: Finally a dog food my Yorkie will eat
review/text: I have tried all types of raw dog food for my yorkie. He used to like the Paw Naturaw Grassfed Bison meals, but the last two bags i received had to be mixed with fresh raw meat in order for him to eat it. I tried Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Raw meals and ended up having to do the same with that food. This morning i put out a small portion of "ZiwiPeak Real Meat Grain Free Air Dried Raw Dog Food, Venison & Fish" from a 2.2 lb bag and my yorkie gobbled it up. Shipping was quick too. I order on Monday and received it on Tuesday. I am very pleased with the product and the shipment.<br /><br />I am sold on this product and will definitely order this again.

review/summary: What a great product!
review/text: My dog started to become finicky with her Wellness Core dog food.  She must stay on it for allergy purposes so I really have no option but to encourage her to eat it.  I never in a million years thought I would spend 26 dollars on 2 pounds of dog food but I did.  I do not feed this to my dog by itself.  I crumble up the pieces and mix it in with my dog's food.  Man....does she gobble up her food now.....it is terrific not having to sit with her to get her to eat.  Even the cat picks some of the Ziwi out of her bowl.  : )  I certainly could not afford to feed my dog this food by itself but for those of us that want to give our dogs a treat or that need a supplement to encourage our pets to eat, I would strongly recommend this dog food.  It is quality through and through.  : )

review/summary: greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst
review/text: I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!

review/summary: Our 2 dogs LOVE it!!!
review/text: We have a 6 month old Shih Tzu and a 2 year old white fluffy mix.  They weight 8lbs and 15 lbs respectively.  Each eats about 1 scoop a day.  Each 11lb bag lasts us about 1.5 months.<br /><br />Yes - it is not a lot of weight, but its also not full of filler.  A lot of dogs eat 3x + what they need to because their food is so lacking in nutrients.  This is pure meat (which as a vegetarian is odd to write).  Our dogs love apples, bananas, and oranges - but love their lamb.<br /><br />Warning - we just moved and couldn't find Ziwipeak.  They wouldn't touch anything else we bought!  Seriously.  They are hooked. They love it.<br /><br />So we are huge fans!

review/summary: Best alternative to a raw diet
review/text: This is the best alternative to feeding your dog a natural raw diet.<br />But it is WAY over priced. You can make your own raw diet for less than $1 a pound. Sorry but $10+/lb is not a good bargain. You can buy human grade cuts of raw fresh meat for WAY less than that. Even Lamb.<br />Good philosophy, not practical.

review/summary: LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the product AND the company behind it!
review/text: I wrote a REALLY long review regarding a different brand freeze dried dog food and now I'm wishing I hadn't because it probably makes this product seem not as good in comparison and nothing could be further from the truth!<br /><br />When I originally read all of the reviews about this product I was a bit skeptical but VERY hopeful (despite the cost)since so many reviewers said that this was the one food that their totally-picky dog would actually eat.<br /><br />When I first tried giving her a nibble while out on a walk she turned her nose up at it like she does with all new things. I slowly started giving her some, mixed in with a clump of almond butter and her kibble. Eventually I got her to eat it and was happy to have something else to feed her along with the kibble and the other raw products I feed.<br /><br />(I know that raw is not supposed to be mixed with kibble, but in this case I am just trying to get her to eat anything) Anyway, I continued to do this until one day she just didn't seem to want it. Finally it dawned on me that she probably JUST wanted this and nothing else and much to my surprise I was right!<br /><br />She likes it so much that she will eat it without the almond butter, which is a HUGE relief to me for it's literally the FIRST and only food I've been able to skip the almondt butter with since she first stopped eating.<br /><br />She will get sick of it after a few days so of course I alternate what I feed her; before she had stopped eating completely I had her on a rotation diet which I believe is better for them anyway. The only downside, of course, is the cost, especially if you have a bigger dog like I do.<br /><br />It's understandable, however, since the food is imported and air dried which I imagine takes longer. I love being able to feed my dog a raw diet without the GI upset she gets with fresh raw. I finally noticed that her feces is MUCH smaller when she is on a raw-only diet, and for a dog of 60+ lbs hers weren't that big to begin with.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I can't say how AWESOME the ZiwiPeak company is! When I first noticed and wanted to try this product I emailed them asking if I could purchase a sample anywhere. Within days I received a package of the venison product in the mail. (Their "trial size" is a good size bag!) It wasn't until after the fact that I saw that you CAN purchase that size through Amazon, and it retails for $8-$10!<br /><br />Even MORE impressive to me was a few months later when I wanted to try the lamb variety. I wasn't able to find a similar trial size package of the lamb anywhere online, so I emailed them again and asked if the lamb variety was avaialble for purchase in anything smaller than the 2.2 lb bag.<br /><br />Once again within a few days I receive a package in the mail from them, and this time it included a large zip-lock baggie filled with the lamb variety and a scoop. Apparently they don't make the small trial bags of the lamb but that didn't stop them from sending me some! (which so far my dog seems to like!)<br /><br />To put this into perspective, I have emailed other raw manufacturers asking where I can purchase sample products from, including the other company I reviewed, and many of them never even answered me much less sent me anything!<br /><br />It definitely feels good to be feeding my dog something that I know she actually likes, plus feeding the benefits of a natural raw diet, PLUS a product that uses a drying process that hopefully preserves some of the natural enzymes of raw food.<br /><br />Can't say enough good things about this food - if it was the ONLY food I fed my dog it wouldn't be nearly as expensive to feed her but unfortunately because of her pickiness this isn't the case.

review/summary: Ziwipeaks: A great, all natural dog food
review/text: Ziwipeaks is a great, freeze dried diet for my dog. Though it runs a bit expensive and rare, it's a great all natural, product. I use the venison because I'm trying to stick with my mini dachshund's ancestral diet. My mini is 2 years old and has been using this food for about 16 months now. She has a beautiful, soft, shiny coat and is healthy and energetic. The food comes in these small bits which are softer and more manageable for little, 13# dogs. Ziwipeaks is an excellent brand if you want no grain or sugar additives and you want to give your dog one of the best quality foods available.<br /><br />S. Joseph

review/summary: Excellent food for dogs with allergies
review/text: My golden|yellow lab mix was adopted from the shelter with a number of health issues including severe malnutrition, a pretty bad skin condition, and chronic  inflammation of the feet and face.  We placed him on an elimination diet and found that he was allergic to chicken, turkey and beef.  I use the ZiwiPeak, fish and pork as the main sources of protein for his diet. He loves the venison over the other flavors and has put on 40 healthy pounds and his skin and allergy issues have pretty much been cleared-up.<br /><br />The food is not the hard dried fare, but small moist squares.  It offered a good option for a balanced meal and you cannot beat the convenience of the pouch.  I would recommend refrigeration after opening.

review/summary: Great substitute for raw diet, but expensive!
review/text: We have a 13 month old, 100+ pound Rottweiler who loves his Ziwipeak.  We started him on the raw diet a few months ago, and use ZiwiPeak for training treats and for regular meals.  It combines the benefits of a raw diet with the convenience of kibble.  Notable good points: great 'output' for a dog with a sensitive stomach, gleaming coat with significantly less dander, fresh breath, easy to feed, and good for times when feeding frozen raw is difficult (traveling, boarding, you've forgotten to defrost the raw...).<br /><br />I took away one star for the high cost.  HOWEVER, a portion of Ziwipeak goes a longer way than the same amount of kibble, and the cost is on par - or slightly less if you look around - than most frozen raw foods.

review/summary: Best thing on the market (without the mess)!
review/text: My puppy has been on way too many dog foods: Orijen, Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and now ZiwiPeak. Out of the four, I'd say this is the best but also the most expensive. A 2.2lb bag lasts probably 3 weeks at most, but at least I know I'm feeding her raw without the mess of raw. It's not cheap but considering how much it costs for us to eat out per meal, $28/bag for 3 weeks really isn't much on the larger scheme of things. It also helps that she loves this stuff and gobbles it up and we know she's not getting any filler. For those who are concerned that the serving size in the back is too little, we had the same concern. But after giving her more than what was recommended, we noticed our puppy was not finishing her bowl of food each time which told us that she was already full and didn't even want more. So if you're used to feeding your dog kibble, the reason there's less to feed her is because there's no filler and it's just meat, meat and more meat so they fill up on it without having to process things like potato. I've also noticed that my dog sneezes and farts significantly less. She used to get eye stains but after we switched to Orijen and now ZiwiPeak, we noticed that her stains disappeared all together!<br /><br />Unless my puppy has any health or allergy issues to ZiwiPeak, I will never switch her to any other brand or type of food!

review/text: This dog food is absolutely wonderful.  If I could afford to, I would feed my dog only this.  My 2 year old Vizsla is the pickiest dog I've ever met (won't even eat most treats) and she can't get enough of this food.  Not only does she actually get excited about her meals, it has had marvelous effects on her digestion, even though she only gets this food about half the time.  Her stools are noticeably smaller and more solid (always a problem with her) and her usually bad flatulence is almost non-existent.  If you have a dog with any food sensitivities and have tried many different foods this will be the last food you will need to try.  My dog has never looked and acted healthier than she has on this food (and I have tried about 20 different brands).  You won't be disappointed, it is worth every penny!

Well we love our dog but we were looking for a compromise that would not cost an arm and a leg. He just would not eat other dry dog foods and we were told feeding him canned food should be the exception and not the rule.<br /><br />This seems to be it. He likes this one the best.  But we are going to have to rotate it with other varieties. Because he just wont eat the same thing for any length of time.<br /><br />Definitely, he likes this one a whole lot. And we can feel good about the quality.  Also this supposedly keeps the amount of poo down to.

Why wouldn't he?<br /><br />A hidden advantage of using this food is that you don't have to pick up much poo at all. Because this food is nearly twice as concentrated as kibble you'd only be picking up about half as much poo, which is a good benefit. Also, it takes up half as much space in your storage.<br /><br />An all around winner which more than makes up for the small premium in price.

review/summary: My Westie loves it!
review/text: I have a 6 year old westie that had the worst food allergies, her coat was very brittle, and she had low energy.  One walk and she'd be passed out.  As many of you on here, I take pride in my dog and pride that I want to take care of it the best that I am able to. I've tried blue buffalo and other high rated foods, but she would not eat them unless I "spiced" it up with something. It was time consuming, frustrating, and hard to keep her on an eating schedule.  I finally decided to give this a go ahead even though it is on the pricey side.<br /><br />What I've noticed is that she eats it immediately and even licks her bowl.  Her coat is soft and shiny now, she's a running dog now than a walk dog (and thats saying something considering she's a westie), and her eating schedule is regulated and I have a better idea of what she's eaten so I can control her weight (she's a small westie around 14 lbs.)<br /><br />For those of you thinking that its too expensive there's no way you could afford to keep your dog on this diet. For my dog she requires about 0.75 ounces or 3/4 of a scoop and that goes a long way for a 2.2 lb. bag.  So its not like I am buying this dog food every week.<br /><br />The only small negative is the dog food has a slight smell to it.  Nothing that will make you vomit but its not something I am used to smelling when giving her dog food.  For those wondering what the dog food looks like?  It's like small shredded pieces of dark jerky.<br /><br />Recommendation?  BUY
