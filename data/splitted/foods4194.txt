review/summary: BEST treats!  My Dog's favorite!
review/text: I know, they sound kind of disgusting.  Bite sized bits of lamb lung... Kind of offputting.  But these treats are the BEST treats of all the ones I buy-and I buy a LOT of them.  They're soft, but not chewy... Easily breakable and chewable, but somewhat crunchy.  It's only a 5 oz bag but there are LOTS inside-many more than the photo would lead you to believe.  These treats are so good that I can get my 7 month old Morkie to do ANY trick I ask-I use these as the "High Value" treats because he loves them so much!  The Beef flavor are just as wonderful-really anything from Merrick is great.<br /><br />Make your dog happy and try these treats!  They're my dog's absolute favorite.  :)

review/summary: Made 2 of my dogs throw up each time they ate them
review/text: I bought these Merrick Lamb Training Treats from my local petco. I gave them to all three of my dogs and one threw up. I thought it was odd since he had never thrown up before.  A few days later I gave all three of my dogs the trests and this time two of them threw up the treats and all their food.  I called Merrick and reported it.  They just told me to take the treats back to the store.  best if used by date of 07 Sept 2012 so they are not any where near to being expired

review/text: My dad pushed me to buy this because we was short on food. Last year, I was given gift cards as an appreciation for doing surveys for them and I redeemed the codes, we had to go to the food section of this site and see if they had a large bag of potato chips. When I first recieved it, the bag was small. After that, I will no longer buy nothing like this.

review/summary: Makes cloudy iced tea
review/text: This tea is just OK. It doesn't taste bad, but it doesn't taste any better than Luzianne or Lipton. And, unlike Luzianne, it's cloudy which I really don't like to see in a clear pitcher and glass. I would be embarrassed to serve this to guests. I've made it according to the enclosed "moon brewing" directions and also in my iced tea maker. It's cloudy both ways. Also, these tea bags make a gallon of tea each so unless you like really strong tea, they're too big for a 3-quart iced tea maker unless you dilute it after you brew. I'm disappointed and won't order this flavor or this brand again.

review/summary: Total Zero Tastes Different Than Sugar Free - Don't Like
review/text: I highly recommend you buy a single can of the new "Total Zero" version of Red Bull before you buy a case of Total Zero.  That way, if you don't like it, you've only bought one can, not 24.<br /><br />I'm a long time user of both the regular ("Original") version and the sugar free version.<br /><br />For my tastes, there isn't a huge difference between the Original version and the sugar free version, but there is a noticeable difference between the sugar free and "Total Zero" versions.<br /><br />Everything tastes different to different people, but I don't like the new Total Zero version.  It leaves, for me, a mediciney after-taste.  If you are drinking this late at the bar with your favorite adult beverage, you might not care, but I drink my Red Bulls by themselves as a pick me up during the day.<br /><br />Now, what do I do with the 23 other cans....?

review/summary: Prefer over regular Red Bull
review/text: I had not tried Red Bull Total Zero prior to purchasing the case on sale at Amazon.  I've had the regular and the sugar-free flavors and to me, I prefer the taste of Total Zero.  In some ways the flavor doesn't seem to be as strong and overbearing as the normal Sugar-Free can.  I don't really notice any strange after-taste in comparison to the other Red Bull flavors, they all have a similar "mediciney" taste.  I would definitely recommend trying a single can before the purchase of a case, unless you can get it on sale and want to take a chance.

review/text: I haven't received it. I don't give a crap if it tastes like donkey piss. I bought this to support a private company that was willing to take a tremendous personal risk to support private, non-.gov near-space endeavors. There's no other way to do it. The Soviets and NASA got the whole kit and kaboodle going 50+ years ago. Our 1/2 century's long exodus from dependency on a single cradle planet started from a .gov seed, and HAS just begun. But, our success depends on private enterprise, and that is the era we have been segueing into over the last 40 or so years. SpaceEx, Baumbgartner/Red Bull, and MANY others -- they are the NEXT gigantic LEAP for mankind! I do my miniscule part here, buying a case of Red Bull post Red Bull Stratos.

review/summary: Works For Me
review/text: The folks in Austria have come up with a fine product. I gulp down a can of this sugarfree Red Bull every morning about an hour before I make my daily walk. It has made the walks much easier to complete and also increases the walking speed which in turn burns more calories with which I am glad to part. I happened to be over at Sam's club a while ago and they carry this product for 33 bucks and some change so I picked up a case while there. I live about 10 miles from Sam's so with gas prices ever climbing plus the state sales tax it would not be worth a trip just for the Red Bull. For only a couple bucks more Amazon will deliver a case right to my front door. Kinda pricey but the benefits to me are worth the cost.

review/text: Red Bull sugar free is the best.  No crash from sugar and still the same amount of caffeine as regular.<br />I used to drink regular Red Bull but I found that my eyes would really hurt from all of the sugar and that there would be a pretty substantial crash a few hours after consumption.  I typically drank one a day.  I guess you can say that I may have a Red Bull addiction.<br />Since switching to Red Bull Sugar Free, there is no crash and none of that funky eye pain mid-day; and since it is sugar free it's got less calories.  That's my justification at least :)

review/summary: The best energy drink, but super overpriced.
review/text: I think that almost everyone would agree that Sugarfree Red Bull is, without considering price, the best diet energy drink there is.  The flavor is great.  A bar at my university had a $2 (sugarfree) Red Bull & Vodka special... probably the best drink special that exists anywhere.<br /><br />But price is a big consideration, and $2+ for an 8 ounce can is ridiculous.  For everyday waking up/making it through the day energy I've switched to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051BRR4A">The Good Morning Pill  60 Pill Bottle  Energy Pill Supplement to Increase Focus, Replace Energy Drinks, Shots, Coffee - 40% off Holiday Sale!</a>, as 30 cents per pill is much better for my budget.<br /><br />But if a can is free, or if there's a good special on it, I'll never pass up a sugar free redbull and vodka at a bar, my day has been made.  I just wish that Red Bull wasn't so expensive.

review/text: Ah Red Bull, equally fantastic as an energy drink or as a 'mixer' for 'adult beverages,' as my Grandmother used to call them. What can I say that you don't already know? Weather you're looking for an shot of energy or something tasty to blend with vodka and a fresh lime, Red Bull will not disappoint.<br /><br />I find that the low calorie version has about the same flavor as regular, but feels thinner in the mouth. I actually prefer the low cal stuff, and its a staple in my fridge.<br /><br />I should also mention that Red Bull can only truly be appreciated if you've had other 'lesser' energy drinks (rock star comes to mind). Red bull is superior in taste, consistency, and usually has fewer calories. I've tried a good number of energy drinks, and Red Bull is easily the best out there.

review/summary: The Most Popular Energy Drink in the Phillippines
review/text: Red bull energy drink is very popular in the Philippines. It is used by many workers to help fight daily stressors. As for my part, I use it whenever there are upcoming long examinations and oral recitations in our law classes. I need to stay awake for long hours in the evening just to read through long legal excerpts so I can have few wise statements to utter during oral recitations. I need enough energy to endure the brain torture I will experience while I take the two hour of mental battle I will enter into come final examination day.<br /><br />It is no doubt effective but the moment its energy boosting effect wears down; I have no choice but to sleep. Unfortunately when I sleep, it meant sleeping for more than eight hours which is not very healthy. I still prefer the use of my Gene Eden products as natural supplements. It offers long lasting energy which I definitely need since I am working law student. However, I only get it every time I receive packages from my aunt in the US since Gene Eden Vir 101 is still not shipped by Amazon here in the Philippines.<br /><br />Please ship them soon so I can have regular dose of this wonderful product. Thanks!

review/summary: Shipping took a while, but otherwise ok.
review/text: My husband drinks energy drinks nearly every day, so I'm always looking for a good deal.  These were on the Friday Sale, so I ordered a two-pack.  It's an ok deal, but if you watch sales, you can find them about the same price elsewhere.<br /><br />I do like having them shipped to me.  That's nice.  Packaging could be a little better, but that feedback was left in the appropriate place.  I just wish that it hadn't taken twice as long as any other product I have ordered with the Super Saver shipping.  I know that it came well within the aloted time, and I know that they said it takes a few extra days, but I'm spoiled with Amazon's amazingly fast shipping.  We had run out at home, and I was hoping to not have to make the shopping trip.<br /><br />In the end, my husband was quite happy to come home to a fresh 24 pack waiting for him on the doorstep.

review/summary: Great Product, Horrible Price
review/text: Sugarfree Red Bull is by far better than its sugar filled brother. With only 10 calories per can, it tastes lighter and crisper than that "other" Red Bull. It can't replace the morning coffee, but after a workout, it can make you feel significantly better until you can replenish with food.<br /><br />However, the prices on Amazon are NOT a good deal. The only way it is a good deal is if you simply can't find the product anywhere. You can regularly find a 12 pack at any Wal-Mart or grocery store for $20. If you really need 24, then go buy two 12 packs for just over $40. Why would anyone in their right mind pay $10 more? But gas you say? Please, if you spend $10 in gas to get to the store, then by all means buy your Red Bull here. Anyway, to reiterate, great product-horrible Amazon prices.

review/summary: too sweet
review/text: We decided to venture out from beef jerky and tried the other Oberto products.  This one is too sweet for me<br />for a savory product.  Also, there were pieces of jerky that were rather tough.  On the other hand, the Oberto Southern Style BBQ Pork Jerky is one of my favorites.  It has a great meaty taste and all of the pork pieces were<br />tender.  Unfortunately, the pork jerky is not available on Amazon and other sites anymore.

review/summary: Oberto Teriyaki Turkey Jerky too fatty
review/text: The Turkey Jerky was awful this time.  Very fatty and stretchy like it was mosty skin or fat or something.  Couldn't even eat it.  Terrible quality control.  Other orders were pretty good, but this one was not.  I had 4 bags and 3 of them were pretty bad.  I started the process to complain with Oberto, but you have to send in the un eaten portions etc, so I just gave up, too much work to go through.  I'll just take the loss this time...  Very hesitant to order the Turkey jerky again now?

review/text: These are some of the best tasting turkey jerky I have come across. The only complaint is that after comparing them to the warehouse store version of the same product, these pieces are thicker chunks and don't have the same moistness or texture. Some of the pieces I got were just chunks of fat! I never have these problems when I buy the larger bags (same brand and variety) at the warehouse stores.

review/text: The ITEM ITSELF IS FOUR FIVE STAR, THE DENIAL OF Amazon TO SHIP IT TO OUR SOLDIERS overseas WAS A "0", AND IT WAS NEVER EXPLAINED WHY THEY WOULD NOT SHIP IT TO THE "War Zone" TROOPS. Taste Great. Keeps very well, no spoilage. Not that its around that long. No refrigeration needed.<br /><br />Up until our Family members return from "War Zone" it was forwarded over to our Soldier who was thrilled to get it.<br />Prior to purchasing through Amazon it was purchased from the Manufacturer directly, which they no longer ship or sell to individuals. The manufacturer also would ship the product to the War Zone Soldier with no problem.<br /><br />The only downside to the transaction(s) due to Amazon not shipping it to the War Zone Country. The Postal service had no problem whatsoever with doing that as it IS NOT A BANNED FOOD PRODUCT in the Country it was going to. So the package from Amazon had to be opened  and then repackaged in a USPS container to ship.

review/summary: Good flavor but shy on lobster
review/text: Overall this soup is good, however sadly we found the lobster, corn and potatoes to be almost nonexistent. The flavor itself was good; creamy and medium texture. If you expect for it to be hearty, you will be disappointed, but if you like a lighter creamy soup or are looking for a great base to cook with, you will really like it, and the ingredients are very high quality. It tastes great with a side of toasted sourdough bread, and we like to add a good amount of pepper for flavor. If you are new to this brand and are looking for a heartier soup, you may like the clam chowder better.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I figured my supply may need a boost. After looking at my choices, I purchased Yogi. It really is the best tea I've tasted so far. I admit that I drink alot simply because I love the taste. I don't know how well it helped my supply, but I have been nursing my 10mo every 3-4 hrs without problems.<br /><br />I think that just taking in the extra fluids helps. If you are having a big dip in your milk supply I would suggest taking Fenugreek capsules. Makes you smell like maple syrup, but really works. Fenugreek in combination with this tea should help supply issues. I'd continue drinking the tea long after supply is back to normal, sort of insurance. Oatmeal has been said to help too.<br /><br />If your supply is causing nursing problems or concerning you, please contact your lactation consultant or midwife. With help a low supply really can be fixed.<br /><br />Good luck and happy nursing!

review/summary: Great tasting tea, very helpful for milk supply
review/text: I looked at this tea and several others, and actually tried another brand of loose leaf tea before finding this one. After reading all the reviews and comparisons, I decided to bite the bullet and just get this tea. I was quite worried about people's comments concerning the taste, but I figured I'd do what I must in order to keep breastfeeding my son. To my surprise, the tea was actually pretty tasteless compared to the loose leaf nursing tea I was drinking before. And, I think it definitely boosted my milk production. I don't know whether it's the herbs or the increased intake in fluids, but I definitely started pumping 8-10oz per pumping session, which was more than enough for my child. At some point I reduced my intake because I seemed to be overproducing milk and could feed my baby and freeze 12oz each day. When my production dropped a bit, I'd start back up on the tea, drinking a cup after each pumping session. I finished my six boxes pretty quickly and ordered another one two weeks ago.<br /><br />All I can say is that it worked for me. It may or may not work for you, but you won't ever know unless you try it. If buying it in bulk is scary for you, go purchase a single box and drink it to see how you feel about it.

I was looking for something to help boost my milk supply and this did it!! Then I made a mistake of telling other nursing moms and the tea was gone from the store wiithin 2 days lol thank amazon!<br />Make sure to really steep this tea for 10 min or so and I drink 5 cups a day. I don't mind the taste but then again I'm a fan of herbal teas! Yummm<br />Best advice: stay hydrated, feed on demand and this tea will only increase your chances of successful breastfeeding!<br /><br />I'm off to order another box :) good luck, mommies!

review/summary: Keeps Your Supply Going
review/text: I was given a box of this tea in my breastfeeding class before my son was born.  Since then, I have been addicted to this tea.  Not only does it taste good, but it is helping to keep my supply going.  I notice a significant difference in the amount of milk I'm able to pump when I've been regularly drinking this tea vs. when I get really busy and have only a cup every other day or so.  Literally, when I drink my three cups a day, after about 3-4 days, I can pump out almost 40 oz a day.  When I drink only a cup here or there, I'm lucky for 25-28 oz.  I don't know if that swing in milk production can be attributed directly to this tea, but for me, it works and I enjoy the taste of the tea.  I figure, it can't hurt and since I'm planning to breastfeed for 1 year+, I need all the help I can get.

These products helped me stay a day ahead of my daughter. I have been able to avoid formula and the stress of not being able to provide enough milk for her. There is a faint maple syrup smell but it is not overt and no one except me as ever noticed. To be honest I only notice after I work out and I think it it b/c of the sweating.

I don't know if it's the tea or the fluid intake itself, but I found it to help when my supply started to get low.

review/summary: Just plain bad
review/text: I bought this for my wife to help her nurse; I had high hopes for this product, but it fell short in several areas. First, the taste of the tea is awful. The Fennel seeds are way too overpowering. There's a reason that common teas do not include "fennel" as a flavor enhancer; it has an overly strong and odd smell. Yogi has made no concession to balance out the flavor, in fact, it tastes like they just put fennel seeds in the tea bags.<br /><br />Which brings me to my next issue, Yogi is trying to achieve "aqueous extraction" with this tea. Aqueous extraction works well with leaves, but does NOT work well with unground seeds. Seeds have extra natural protections which will not allow for the best extraction of nutrients using hot water alone; this is why coffee beans need to be ground during preparation. The Fennel/Fenugreek/Anise seeds in the tea bags are simply "broken up", not ground. With this product, Yogi has accomplished the equivalent of putting ungrounded coffee beans in a tea bag and calling it coffee. The Fennel, Fenugreek, and Anise in this product are not leaves, they are seeds; for it to work in any sort of effective way, the seeds would have to be completely ground, not just broken.<br /><br />Besides the poor execution in delivery of the nutrients, I was concerned to see that the product had lavender in it. Which, I don't think is all that safe for babies to be even indirectly ingesting.<br /><br />I can give Yogi credit for acknowledging the wonderful natural properties of Fenugreek. But, I'd advise buyers to take it through different means. My wife uses <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004KNHHL8">GNC Herbal Plus� Whole Herb Fenugreek Herbal Supplement 100 Capsules</a> and has been elated at the increase in her production.

review/summary: Tastes good
review/text: I have no idea if this really works, but it tastes good and makes sure I am drinking fluids.  I was told that I would need to drink 12 cups of this a day to help promote milk production.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because each bag only gives 2 cups worth of tea.  Other tea I drink will last me at least 4 cups worth. Other than that no complaints.

review/summary: Best Tea for Lactation Problems
review/text: I had my son early and was having issues when pumping, he had to stay in the NICU. It became very frustrating til my boyfriend bought me this tea. At first it tasted horrible but I was willing to do what I needed to for my baby. Since starting the tea I have not had any lactation issues which helps with giving my preemie baby what he needs to get out of the hospital.

review/summary: Did not increase milk supply
review/text: Did nothing for my milk supply, even though I had 8 cups of tea a day.<br />Tastes pleasant enough (thankfully, it tastes more like lavender to me than fennel), but even though I like tea in general and drink a variety of it every day, it's not pleasant enough for me to drink just for enjoyment. Only if I have to - provided it helps me with the supply. It doesn't*.<br /><br />I did a "subscribe and save" for 1 time a month for this tea, and Amazon sent the second gigantic box to me 18 days after the first one. Now I am stuck with two boxes of tea that doesn't help me and isn't yummy enough to drink every day just for fun.<br /><br />*I purchased fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules and they helped a lot.

review/text: So after trying just about everything to increase my milk supply, I.e. Fenugreek, oatmeal, cookies, water water water,  and really still having difficulty I needed something that could help me! I was supplementing a bottle a day of formula and no matter how much I tried and pumped every 2 hours, I just couldn't make enough! I found this tea, and after reading that it tasted like black licorice I almost didn't try it! But I am so glad I did! It doesn't taste like black licorice at all to me, it is delicious and wonderful! It tastes great, and I haven't had to supplement since starting it! I have 3 glasses a day, and it works perfect for me! Such a lifesaver!

review/summary: Milk Supply Decreased????
review/text: I have consumed two boxes of this and my milk supply has dramatically decreased!  I am trying to isolate any other potential variables and will try to stick with it (since I have 4 boxes left!) but I am disappointed.  Also, this has Anise in it so it you like black licorice you should enjoy the taste.  I however strongly dislike black licorice and have a very difficult time drinking it.  If my supply increases later I will come back and change this review otherwise this has been a waste of money and a bad tasting experiment.<br /><br />***Update, my review stayed.  I will be throwing the last couple of boxes away.  Not work my time or money. Too bad.

review/summary: I think it works
review/text: I bought this tea to increase my milk production after I noticed it was decreasing. I pump at work and could no longer replace the supply that my baby drinks during the day. After using this for about a week, I have noticed that I am back up to prior levels, and maybe am producing even more. However, I also did other things to help increase my production, so I can't say with 100% certainty that the tea is the reason. If nothing else, by drinking 3-4 cups a day, I increased my fluid intake, and my milk production increased. The other things I tried at the same time were: sleep as much as possible, nurse or pump at least every two hours, eat better, and try not to stress about not having enough milk.<br /><br />As for the tea itself, the taste is actually pretty good, as one of the ingredients is chamomile. You really only faintly taste the fennel and anise (I hate licorice). And the fenugreek hasn't caused me to smell like maple syrup. I don't find it hard to drink the recommended amount everyday, and even look forward to it at night since it helps me relax before going to bed.<br /><br />So I would recommend this tea, but can't say for certain that it was *the* thing that helped me. Rather I think it was a combination of everything.

review/summary: A Tea My Tatas Appreciate!
review/text: Early on, after I brought my infant son home, I experienced issues with my milk production (mainly bc I was learning how to adjust my diet to accommodate what my body was trying to do).  At first, I'd ordered the Mother's Milk tea, but when it arrived, I realized it had mint in it, and I'm allergic.<br /><br />Asking around, Yogi's Woman's Nursing Support was suggested by several of my breastfeeding friends (along with fenugreek capsules).  And it works!  I can definitely tell the days that I drink enough (4-5 cups) and when I don't (like weekends, I'm terrible of keeping up with things).  I would recommend this tea to anyone seeking an herbal way to increase their breast milk production.

review/text: I bought this tea based on the great reviews posted here on Amazon.  It seems like this brand, with the addition of chamomile to it, was preferred for taste but otherwise has the same herbs as the other types out there.  I just started drinking it today.  I made a pot of tea and chilled it so I could drink it on my ride to work and then during the day at my desk since they recommend a total of 3 -4 servings a day.  I actually like the taste (though I can imagine growing tired of it once I am drinking it for a few weeks at 4 times a day) and it works well as an iced tea.  Now as for the results... I will have to wait and see.

review/text: I bought this tea to increase milk supply for my 9-month old twins. I could see the difference within a couple of days! The boys started nursing longer and I could pump more milk. I drank 3-4 cups a day as advised, basically after each nursing. I did add a little bit of milk in my tea (tea with sweetened condensed milk is a Russian remedy for increasing milk supply, but it didn't work for me anymore), because my stomach seemed to be upset with the tea without it. And I feel much less stressed out nowadays thanks to the lavender in the tea. I will definitely continue using it as long as I plan to nurse and will buy it again.

review/text: As a first time mom, I am always worried about if I am producing enought milk for my baby.  My pediatrician suggested tea with fenugreek.  I bought this tea previously at the organic food store.  When I went back to get more, it was sold out and of course they could not tell me when more would come in.  I definetly notice an increase in my supply, especially when I pump.  I usually drink a cup first thing in the morning and one before I go to bed in the evening.  I also add honey to make it sweeter since splenda didn't help. Highly recommend.

review/text: Glad to be able to buy this tea online - since its not always easy to shop with a little one around. Seems to help with milk production, and has a mild but pleasant taste of licorice. I had bought another version of this in the store (I think it was called "Yogi Nursing Woman" instead of Nursing Support) and I preferred the flavor, since it was more potent. At any rate, good to have a reason to drink more liquids each day.

review/summary: Pleasant enough tea, not sure if it helps with lactation...
review/text: OK, so I can't tell if it's making that much of a difference as far as milk production goes.  I've done pretty well regardless, but have tried both this tea as well as the Traditional Medicine version and haven't noticed a difference between the two.<br /><br />I don't really have a reason to be paranoid, but I tried the teas to halp build up my freezer stopck of milk in case I have any issues with production and need a good supply of back-up.  As a result I've tried the teas and brewers yeast pills.  I didn't see a significant increase, but they have served as a security blanket of sorts for me :-)<br /><br />However, I wanted to put this review up because so many of the others talk about how tasty the Yogi version is. I just wanted to say that I think the Traditional Medicines and Yogi tea versions taste almost exactly the same, so go with whichever you find the best deal on!

I have used it successfully in smoothies, but my favorite application is mixed with mashed banana, on a whole grain waffle or just eaten with a spoon (generally 1/4 to 1.3 of the banana per serving). My 1yr old son loves it too. I know he needs the fat, so he gets the real kind most of the time, but when we are out, he loves my PB2 as well. I think I'm going to bring some on vacation with us...

review/summary: PB2
review/text: I was introduced to PB2 during a WW meeting.  I made an immediate purchase and shared it at work.  It's the best in smoothies, yogurt or prepared as spreadable peanut butter.  I love that it does not have any added chemical ingredients.  Only 1.5g fat, 1 g of sugar and 94 mg sodium/serving make it a healthy choice.

review/summary: A dieter's dream!
review/text: Anyone on (or ever been on) a diet knows Peanut Butter is a big no-no because of the fat/calories.  This stuff is the perfect answer to all your dreams!  You can mix it with as little/much water as you want so you get the consistency you like and use it on anything!  It basically tastes exactly like peanut butter, just without the sugar - so if it's not sweet enough for you, you can add in a packet of splenda.  It's great!
