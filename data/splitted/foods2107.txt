review/summary: We don't like them....
review/text: I ordered these based on the reviews on this site, and recommendations by other parents of GFCF childen.  I really wanted to like them, but my son will not eat them.  He's tried a few times, but does not like the taste.  They taste OK to me, but this is not the type of snack I typically eat.  I will look for someone to donate the remaining 11 bags to.

review/summary: Leave a weird sensation
review/text: These are a little salty, a little greasy, and a little 'powdery'.  The taste is not bad, BUT, I did have the strangest sensation after eating a couple handfuls - I don't have any known allergies or 'texture issues' with food whatsoever, so it was really bizarre:  they started to sort of taste prickly, like the outer part was sharp or rough, and it was unpleasant to continue eating them.  The closest thing I can compare is imagine chewing on a mouthful of roasted peanut SHELLS.  Very very weird.  I wouldn't buy again, not worth it.

review/summary: HORRIBLE
review/text: Horrible. That is a word to describe these treats. To start, you pull one pea out of the greasy bag and you really can't distinguish which one is the pea and which one is the rice flour. Almost undistinguishable. Second, the pieces are SOAKED with corn oil, literally. Just leave the bag out at room temperature and you'll notice. The description of the product says it is OVEN made but there is no advantage if you soak them in oil!! Fake fake fake nutritional benefits. As described in the package, 9gms of fat in 1oz. it might be understated.<br />Flavorwise is average. Taste like pan-fried tempura-texture like pea, pre-soaked in Mazola oil.

review/summary: These are not "veggies."
review/text: There's a slightly odd taste about this product that I can't figure out from the ingredients.  These are not a substitute for veggies as some people reviewing seem to think.  They're basically a potato chip replacement and just as unhealthy but slightly lower in fat.  These are definitely "junk food" and should be eaten with that in mind in terms of frequency and quantity.  The fact that they're called peas is only because they're molded to look like peas.  Read the label!<br /><br />I won't order them again mainly because of the weird off-putting taste.

review/text: To each his/her own.  I was suckered into buying a case (and the regular ones) on a Friday sale.  I'm now trying to give them away a package at a time.  They are blended, pureed, formed into peapods, but NOT any remote resemblance of an actual green bean.  I hate them (although one of my sister-in-laws and parents have ordered 3 more cases).  Like I said--to each his/her own.  I personally hate them.  But if you like salt, perhaps you'll like these---grab a Brita pitcher before you open to sample.

review/summary: Not What They Advertise
review/text: When I bought this snack I was expecting dried snap peas, which is what they lead you to believe from the packaging. However, they are a far cry from this. They are really a smashed blend of many ingredients bent back into a pea shape. There are a few benefits like fiber and there is some sort of pea in it but overall there are still some poor ingredients in my opinion, especially when I was expecting dried snap peas. Also, the flavor was very bland. Almost like cheerios, or a stale corn puff. Somewhat overpriced too, although I bought them from the grocery store not Amazon. I wouldn't recommend them.

review/text: I wasn't real sure if I would like baked snapea crisps when a manager brought me a bag. After the first couple I still wasn't sold on them but the more I ate them they are really good baked and lightly salted. Multiple managers and I tried to find these again in our local store and was not successful. One manager was told it was a promotional item to see how well they do and not sure if they would be carrying them. I go to my trusted website Amazon found them and made my purchased. These are healthier and better than reaching for potatoe chips - I purchased these now with my veggie chips in place of regular chips. It took my family time to get use to them but when they ran out of their regular chips then they start eating the snapeas and veggie chips.

review/text: I love these too much.  It's *VERY EASY* to wolf down<br />a whole bag in just one sitting.  I'm glad this is a<br />12 pack box!  I can plow through a box of these in<br />record time if I'm not careful.

Since<br />they are made from peas, that's got to be better for<br />you than potato chips, I imagine.  Even if you do eat<br />the whole bag, you will have only eaten around 300<br />calories, so it is not the end of the world.  Try<br />doing that with potato chips (ha ha).  Once you have<br />tried these,  you will want more.  Everyone I have<br />offered them to does.  Try them, you'll love 'em.

review/summary: Fantastic toddler snack; wish they came in organic
review/text: I discovered these when looking for healthy snacks without gluten, soy, or egg for our now 19 month old son. He loves them. With 8g fat, 14g, carbs, 2g fiber and 5g protein, they are a lot more balanced than a lot of toddler friendly snacks.  While they have some salt, they have a lot less than potato chips and other similar choices.  Peacrisps make a good snack on the go and fit in a toddler Snack Trap very well. They aren't completely mess free, he gets a bit covered in greasy crumbs sometimes, but it's not bad enough to deter us. These are a welcome change from cereals and cheese cubes for portable snacks. I like that these are also getting at least a small amount of vegetables in him, too. I would give them 5 stars if they came in organic.

review/text: These have a nice pea flavor and are tasty.  However, I can't see how these are much better for you than potato chips (the only difference is really a pea vs. a potato, as they have about the same amount of fat.)  They claim they are baked but they are very oily.  Eating a serving or two of steamed peas would be a much healthier, and perhaps tastier, way of snacking.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: Salty, crunchy, healthy; that's my kind of snack. Except for the high fat content (about half the calories are fat calories) they are really a good addition to a salad or just eat them from the bag. The 2 grams of fiber make up for some of that. I like the original flavor best.

review/summary: Fun little snack
review/text: These are a fun little snack. They taste good and are crunchy, so you can pass on the potato chips.  They have two grams of fiber and a small amount of vitamins.  They are not low in calories, so be careful of the amount you eat.  My daughter likes them, which is a plus.  The price was good at Amazon, but the shipping was steep.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious
review/text: Calbee Snapea Crisps are an absolutely delicious snack. I am always looking for a healthy crunchy snack and my niece introduced these to me, and I love them. There are so many foods that I can't eat, and I always have a craving for something crunchy that isn't "junk" food. Now I have found the perfect healthy and delicious "Munchy" for me. I go through bags of them like crazy. Oh and my two little female Shihtzu doggies love them also. As soon as I open a bag they are right on my lap. And I know I can give them to them as Snapeas only contain healthy ingredients. Thank you Calbee for making such a healthy and delicious snack. I rate them A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+A+ and have recommended them to everyone. And I find that ordering them through Amazon is the best way to go!!!!!

review/text: I do like the taste, but these are in no way natural.<br /> Think green, pea flavored cheetoes.  They only vaguely resemble the picture on the package.  When I bought them the first time, I thought I was buying dehydrated sugar snap peas, thats what i get for not reading the ingredients. (bought at walmart)  but as i said, i do enjoy the flavor.<br />  Heres the ingredients (this is the ceasar flavoring type)<br />green peas, corn oil, rice, sugar, salt, cheese powder(milk),yeast extract powder, dextrin natural flavor(spice extract flavor, cheese flavor) calcium carbonate, vinegar powder, citric acid, ascorbic acid (vit c)

review/text: Be warned.  They are addictive; however, they are not dangerous!  I love salty, crunchy snacks but I have to limit my sodium and fat intake.  Trying to find something relatively healthy isn't that easy.  These are low in sodium, not too bad in the fat department, and they have a bit of fiber.  They may not qualify as real health food, but they come close enough for me.  They are great with a glass of wine or cocktail before dinner.  I think you will like them.

review/summary: An alternative to Cheetos
review/text: These are as good as far as exciting flavor and craving value as Cheetos, just without the orange color and cheese flavor. I can easily eat the entire bag, but they go through my system rather quickly. They aren't pea pods in the sense of dried vegetable chips, but rather pureed mixture of peas and other ingredients that aren't very good for you. As said, they are healthier than your typical snack food (pretzels always for the health-conscious though), but for the price of $1.99 at my local grocery store, they hit the spot nicely. The original and Caesar flavors don't matter to me; they are both very tasty. I recall though that the Caesar flavor is more enjoyable, but a little higher in sodium. As the saying goes, if it tastes good, it isn't necessarily good for you; I would say that this snack is a little of both, mainly thanks to some fiber. However, other reviewers have mentioned the corn oil used is GMO (genetically modified organism), but I am uncertain know how harmful it is to human health. Speaking of GMO, I have found such oranges at my local grocery store. They weren't very good! (Respect nature.)<br /><br />Just eat these in moderation as with anything else and you should be fine. Walk a few miles after eating these 'peas' would be my advice. Five stars for taste, so I would recommend these over potato chips or cheese curls any day.

review/text: My boys love these so much (and so do I) that I can't just buy one bag at a time and they never last longer than about 10 minutes once I walk a couple of bags in the door.  Solution?  Amazon - buy in bulk.  I try to buy them once a month.  If I bought them more often, they'd be eating too many of them all the time!

review/text: My son loves these, but they can be expensive.  Getting them from amazon is much less expensive- especially since my son can go through a bag a day (and there's actually peas in there!)  I have to say that they are a love 'em or hate 'em kind of thing.  They have a crispy cheese puff texture, with a salty pea flavor.  My advice would be to get a bag from a "natural" type grocery store first before you invest in a dozen.

review/summary: Just bought my second CASE
review/text: My 20 month old has been eating these since he was about 16 months old. They are a great snack for toddlers. He calls them "peas" and I don't mind giving him fistfuls!! Made with real peas & rice I feel so much better giving him this than a pretzel or cracker. I can bring them anywhere in a baggie or plastic container & they are the perfect snack. Kids on the playground are always trying to get at them & other moms are like, "What are those?" Love my peas! Cannot say enough about how great these crisps are!!  Only downside is that I wish the bag was re-sealable. Can't tell you how many have spilled out in my stroller or diaper bag.

review/summary: Tasty snacks!
review/text: I found these Snapea Crisps a while back at a local grocery store and enjoyed it so much that I decided to purchase an entire box with 12 packs (it came out less expensive and I was able to share them with friends). I liked that it was baked and that it was actually made from snap peas. If I recall correctly, the product's website explained that the peas are dehydrated and made into a powder form, in order to eventually make them into it's appealing snow pea shape. I enjoy the lightly salted flavor as well the crispiness of it - makes it difficult to just eat one. Also, my toddler and preschooler enjoy them, so I feel better about giving them a snack that contains peas. I'm not a fan of ceasar salad, so I have not ventured into the ceasar salad flavored crips, but so far I've enjoyed just the original flavor.

review/summary: Yummy!!!!!
review/text: They're just really good, they have some protein compared to potato chips but they still have fat and salt so they do taste good.  But the sodium % of daily value which is 22 pieces is only 4% so that doesn't seem bad at all, I think there are bags of potato chips and pretzels and oh the worst are those corn chips, they are just like pouring a bottle of salt down your throat, these taste plenty salty to me.  They're addicting so watch out!  I also ordered some other snacks that maybe I can mix things up. Such a lucky find these crips, I just was hungry before my sewing lesson and stopped into a convenience mart and saw them, that was lucky, funny thing it was called Lucky Mart I think.  I don't live around there and dunno if they have em here and don't feel like looking so I figured just order the 12 pack online.  I read the snapeas mostly come from Canada and that they have good farming standards so hopefully it isn't so bad that these aren't organic.  Trader Joes green bean crisp also sound good, haven't tried them.

Maybe they aren't the healthiest thing around, but they have to be better than regular potato chips, right? They taste very good, but maybe the taste is acquired, because the first bite I tried it was like, "huh"? But, funny enough, it just got better and better, and now I also find them delicious. The price here is good, as my local grocery charges almost double per bag. Only critique is the package it comes in doesn't say how they're made. That would be interesting...

review/summary: Give it more then one try
review/text: I gave this flavor to my 6 month old son but he did not like it so I tried to blend it, but still no luck. It does have very strong taste especially for babies who had only veggie and fruit blends. So I mixed the blended beef stew with green beans ( 1,5 oz of beef stew with 3,5oz green beans ) and my baby ate it all no problem. I just think since he did not have any flavor like that before ( tomato, beef, spices ) he just need to get used to the flavor. Sweet peas works too and takes away that sharp tomato taste. I will keep adding less of the veggie blends and I bet he will get used to the taste in no time. So do not give up if your baby doesn't like it right away. I bet you as adults also had some meals first time and did not love it and now are enjoying them ( sushi, oysters..... ) so let your little one get used to new flavor.<br />My son loved Chick chick and Super salmon right away but I think it is because he had sweet potato and carrots before so he was used to the flavor already.<br />UPDATE: one week later I have split the packet in two containers and added 1oz. sweet peas and 1oz. carrots, and my baby ate it no problem, likes it a lot when warmed up.<br />Week after that I just warmed up the packet and my son ate it no problem, loved it as much as chick chick or super salmon.<br />So if you did not have luck first time do not give up, it took couple tries for us and now he loves it.

review/summary: Excellent baby food for 8+ mos.
review/text: I love this baby food. The pouch makes it so easy to bring anywhere. I initially purchased these for having backup food in the diaper bag, but they are so good I will give them to my baby when I don't have the time or energy to make him something. I really like the beef stew because it has great ingredients, including quinoa. I love the Plum Organics brand, too, but the Happy Baby brand seems to add a little more (quinoa, whole wheat pasta) to their foods, creating a great texture for babies who are just past the simple puree stage. And most importantly, my baby gobbles these up--more so than my homemade foods.

review/summary: Delicious and super easy soup mix
review/text: For a boxed dry mix, this soup is wonderful. The first time I made it, I was actually startled by the incredible aroma when I opened the package; it smelled delicious. It's super easy, too, as you simply add it to water and simmer for a while. As they note on the box, it's especially yummy if you sprinkle some bacon bits and shredded chedder on top before you serve it. Add a couple of slices of homemade bread and a green salad and you have dinner.

review/summary: Decent coffee but not worth the dough
review/text: This is a medium-dark roast bean with an OK flavor.  I had high expectations due to the price and the fact that it's 100% Kona beans.  These are supposed to be the best there are.  I'm not so sure this is such a great roast as I have tried bags of Starbucks that easily match or give better flavor at half the price.  It seems like they over-roasted these beans.<br /><br />I don't like the flavor coffee alone, so since I paid this much for it, I have been mixing it with Jeremiah's Kona Blend which is an outstanding light-medium roast for a fair price.  It seems to be a pretty good mix.  I do like the Jeremiah's better by itself though.<br /><br />If it were half the price, it would seem like a decent deal if you like a darker roast.  I will seek out other brands when it comes to 100% Kona beans.  I can't see this would be the best out there.  I also will look for a lighter roast Kona bean.<br /><br />It makes an OK cup of coffee.  OK is the word for this coffee.  Cost is bad.

Unless you love date paste (from the fruit), you will hate these bars!  They are exactly that--chocolate flavored date paste.  They are the worst gluten free food I have ever tried.  I thought that these bars, compared to the fruit ones, would at least be more chocolate-y than fruity.  Nope.  They taste horrific.  There isn't even any positive comment I can make about these bars.  If you like the bars, save your money; buy date paste and just eat it.  GROSS!

review/summary: Very fresh and tasty
review/text: I really like Virginia Diner unsalted peanuts, so I decided to give this flavor a try.  The name "Old Bay" refers to the seasoning of the same name (normally associated with seafood), so if you are familiar with that seasoning you have an idea what to expect.  It's nothing like a bay leaf.<br /><br />If you've ever had Nabisco's Doo-Dads snack mix then these peanuts will be familiar to you - they taste almost just like the peanuts in the mix (and if you wanted to make your own Chex party mix, these nuts would be perfect).<br /><br />Like all Virginia Diner products, the nuts come with a foil seal which is tightly depressed because the contents are vacuum packed.  When you break the seal, you will hear the air rush in.  This type of packaging helps insure the nuts are fresh and crunchy, and they were.<br /><br />The nuts are small, and mostly in halves.  There are a few fragments, but not many.

review/summary: Virginia Diner Old Bay Seasoned Peanuts
review/text: I purchased these as a part of a set (Regular, Old Bay and Cajun Peanuts). To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The peanuts bear zero resemblance to the ones shown. The are small, fragmented and stale. Their appearance and size would lead you to believe that these were rejects from off-brand packagers. They are too small and fragmented for Planters to consider ever using them. While I was not fond of the flavor, that is a subjective judgement and I do not take it into account when giving this product two stars.<br /><br />My recommendation, skip these and get some real Virginia peanuts from Williamsburg Peanuts.

review/summary: Where is the Hazelnut Latte?
review/text: Love the Hazelnut Latte but-----------<br /><br />Try and get it. I live in FL and CT and visit MA frequently & nowhere can you get it in CT & one place in MA. I have searched every grocery store in CT & MA. Luckily in FL Walmart & Publix carries it but if you don't get there and buy it all when it is stocked, there is a big wait until the next shipment comes in.<br /><br />I like it becasue it is fairly low in sugar and so much better then any type of soft drink. I mix it with low fat milk and it serves as a lunch for me.<br /><br />What I do not understand is that there is the  International coffee in the cans that flood the shelves but must be made w/hot water and some of us prefer a cold drink instead.<br /><br />Everyone I have spoken to also loves this latte after they have tried it but they also have the same problem of trying to obtain the packages.<br /><br />Love your product but a lot needs to be done in the marketing area.

review/text: I'm an amateur cake decorator and my clients (as well as myself) abhor super sweet frostings made from shortening and sugar.<br /><br />So, i tend to use more whipped-cream frostings/fillings and this product works well.  It keeps my whipped cream stiff for hours, it pipes well and fills without weeping into the cake.<br />My only criticism is that it tends to make tiny air bubbles in the cream, resulting in a not-so-smooth coat or perfectly piped borders, but it's probably because I aerate it too much (my fault).  Overall, I love this and its so hard to find at the grocery stores here...So THANKS AMAZON! I LOVE YOU!

They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.

review/summary: Great product for its purpose
review/text: For those on a low glycemic or low carb diet, I think you'd be hard pressed to find a better non-sucralose or non-maltitol syrup.  No, it's not going to fool you into thinking you're eating Log Cabin or Aunt Jemima.  But if you're looking at this review, I'll bet you already gave up those like I did, and would be happy to find a good substitute that allows you to enjoy normal breakfasts with your family again.<br /><br />The taste is fine with normal pancakes and waffles, I haven't tried it with protein or special recipe pancakes.<br /><br />Yes, the syrup is more liquid than most syrups, but this is how I deal with it . . . serve it on the side in a condiment cup rather than pouring it directly over the pancakes or waffles.  I dip each bite into the cup with my fork.  Served this way, the syrup is not soaked up and 1 tablespoon of syrup lasts me a whole waffle or 2 medium size pancakes.  That makes the syrup more economical, too, because a bottle goes farther.

review/summary: Really runny and virtually tasteless--but hey, better than nothing on my high protein waffles
review/text: I enjoy the Nature's Hollow jam/preserves so much--am having some right now between typing, the blueberry over Fage yogurt, and it's so good--that I figured I'd give the sugar-free syrup a try.<br /><br />Um. Not so great. I made high protein waffles and I usually use either natural applesauce, a homemade berry compote, or Smucker's sugar free breakfast syrup on these babies. Today, I chopped up strawberries and used this syrup. So disappointing. The flavor is slight,slight. A hint of mapleness. The sweetness is okay. The texture is watery.<br /><br />Now, I can live with a ightweight, watery texture if you pump up the flavor. :) But this one, not so much. For now, I'll stick to my Smucker's sugar-free (though it's not perfect, it's been the tastiest fake maple syrup that has a genuine thick consistency). Or, occasionally, I just cave and have real maple syrup. (I'm not on a low-carb diet, I just try to avoid sugar when possible.)<br /><br />I think this may serve better to use in fruit mixtures to then top waffles or pancakes or to flavor plain oatmeal. This syrup will sweeten stuff up with a light maple flavor, and while it was kind of a fail on my waffles, I can see that this might work better to flavor my slow-cooked oatmeal. That's why this gets 2 stars instead of 1 star: Whilte it failed for me as a good syrup for pancakes and waffles, I suspect it will be good as a maple flavoring agent. And this one is way better than the Maple Grove Farms one and the DaVinci one. For low-carbers, worth trying, even if not very satisfying substitute for the real thing.<br /><br />I hope Nature's Hollow reformulates the syrup adding more maple flavor and thickening it up a bit. I'd retry their product if they did.

Great for sucking on, particularly if you are trying to quit smoking, as I currently am.

I, too, have had trouble finding these in the store, and when I do, they are priced significantly higher than the price here. Not only that, but you save by not having to hunt them down.
