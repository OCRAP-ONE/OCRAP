review/summary: We've had better
review/text: My husband and I are big coffee drinkers, at least between the two of us we have 80 years' experience.  We drink many different brands and typically prefer flavored coffees.  I tried Luzianne based upon my experience with this brand for other food products, the other reviews, and because Amazon ran it at a pretty good price, $5.28 per pound, including the super saver shipping.  The first thing after brewing the coffee this morning, I asked my husband what he thought of it.  His response:  "It's coffee, nothing special."  I'd have to second that assessment.  This is a medium, leaning to light, brew and will start your morning off if you need coffee.  However, we are used to more full-bodied medium blends that satisfy more.

review/text: I have always like sardines and recently decided to start eating them on nearly a daily basis.  I bought two cases of these Season sardines in water and started taking them to work to eat as a snack.  I really like the taste!  These came 3 to a can, seemed to be of the larger type.  They still had the skin and bones, which was fine by me.  I love the taste of fish, so I didn't have much interest in the skinless and boneless, bland tasting ones.

I wasn't sure if she'd like this at first so I bought a smaller amount. But she said this particular tea is very fragrant and has a great taste. Green tea is probably one of the best teas: chocked full of antioxidants and benefits if you drink it without cream and excessive sugar. Enjoy.

review/summary: Good Product..Stains
review/text: I wish my son could have stayed with this.  I started it because I thought he was lactose intolerant.  It turns out he has a milk protein allergy and had to be switched to a hypoallergenic formula.  That said, when he was eating it he had no issue with the taste and no bowel problems.  The formula did smell awful and when he spit up, it stained his clothes, which is to say I had to throw out half his wardrobe.  It definitly is worth a try though, and don't believe any of that aresnic nonsense.  The reseach was shamelessly misleading and did not portray the actual results correctly.  One cannot compare the arsenic level allowed in water with infant formula.  Water calculations are based on a lifetime's worth of consumption.  Formula is for a year or less.  Apples and oranges.

review/summary: Excellent formula!!!
review/text: After trying multiple commercial formulas (could only breastfeed for 10 days due to medical issues), baby had major issues with feeding. He was severely constipated and began breaking out in a face/neck rash from forehead to neck (including his eyes). Researched this online and decided we needed an organic formula that is lactose free. This is the ONLY USDA certified organic formula without lactose (without using soy, which caused the baby's face/neck rash & didn't help his constipation). Within two days of using this formula, the baby's face rash disappeared, his bowels went back to normal, and he became a happy, energetic two month old (he went from screaming his head off hours each day to a baby who now can't stop cooing and smiling)! We could NOT be happier with this formula. It says "toddler" formula yet meets the FDA standards for infant formula. Nutritionally, it's soooo much better than commercial, non-organic formulas due to the USDA certified organic ingredients, it does not use corn syrup, and the formula now comes in BPA-free cans with a BPA-free scooper to measure the formula. Excellent excellent product! Shop around for better prices (I've been able to find some companies online offering this for $12 per can, free shipping, and no tax!)

review/summary: Finally found the right formula!
review/text: My 5 week old daughter was supplementing with Similac Advanced Organic, but as I slowly stopped pumping and was supplementing with more formula, she became much more gassy (at least half her feedings were affected).  I then switched to Similac Sensitive (fussiness/gas) and she was much worse to the point of being inconsolable.  When I was pregnant I originally researched this formula and wish I used this from the beginning.  I love the fact that it's organic and it doesn't contain any soy.  Since she is half Asian she must have inherited my lactose intolerance (when I was a baby, I was on isomil).  Now she is much happier and so are we.

review/summary: Fabulous Formula!
review/text: This formula is wonderful!  I was looking for a formula to use as a supplement while breastfeeding that was not made with hexane.  I also needed a formula that is lactose free, as I do not do well with dairy myself, and regular formulas tend to cause my then 5 month old, a lot of gas, stomach pains, and bathroom issues.  Baby's Only, though pricier than the Target brands, is worth every penny!  It meets the nutritional guidelines provided by my daughter's pediatrician while still remaining fully in line with my husband's and my health goals and beliefs.  This formula is much more affordable through Amazon.com website.  Definitely worth the price in health value alone!

review/summary: Love Colorado Spice Company Ground Ancho
review/text: This review is after my second 32 ounce container of Ground Ancho Chili Pepper.  I LOVE this product and the Colorado Spice Company, and props to Amazon for having it too!  I use the Ancho Chili Pepper for dry rubs, marinades, sauces - add a teaspoon or so to some Mayo (1/4 cup) and Pesto (1-2 tablespoons) for anything from potatoes to salmon - AMAZING!!  When I purchased the first container I thought to myself that I would die with it 1/2 full, but no way.  I add it to many soups, stews, and it's a must for chili.  I shared some with a couple of friends (refilled old empty spice jars and put on a new label).  I no longer purchase standard chili powder, I use CSC Ancho and Smoked Paprika instead.  I highly recommend their spices.  The quality is amazing, the value is excellent, and it keeps well.  I opened my second container before my first was completely empty and compared the aroma of my four year old container and there was no difference.  It was kept in a cool, dark pantry in it's original container and it did not lose any of its flavor.  I have tried and highly recommend Colorado Spice Company's Ancho Chili Pepper, Smoked Paprika, and the Tomato Powder.  I'm sure they are all amazing, but those are the only products I have tried thus far.

review/summary: Best hardtack ever!
review/text: These are hardtack, aka Pilot crackers or biscuits.  Think of larger, thicker saltines.<br /><br />Hardtack is often used as "survival food", but these are too tasty to be considered solely survival food. OTOH, the packaging (sealed can) of the Mountain House pilot crackers is quite a bit better for survival purposes.  These could get crushed.<br /><br />Not that these wouldn't work. In fact, I suggest a few boxes of hardtack and some peanut butter as a very good survival combo. Both stay good for a long time.<br /><br />There are some cool recipes for hardtack or Pilot crackers out there, so get a few extra and give them a try!

review/summary: I have to agree with Wulfstan's review and these are mighty tasty
review/text: I'd also go with Mountain House for pilot crackers which could be used for survival food. Since we had a situation where a family member was trapped in an unexpected blizzard, I think these might be worth keeping in the trunk of a car. My husband and I thought they were plenty tasty, even without butter, jam or jelly. I wouldn't buy these to have as a snack food in the house if  we weren't in an emergency. At $7.19 per box, why pay the price for a snack food?<br /><br />They also have these advantages for short-term emergencies (very short-term):<br /><br />1. The outside package contains individually sealed packages with 4 crackers in each. This means that even after you open the main package, you still have 4 sealed packages, each containing 4 crackers, which should remain fresh and ready to use because of the individual packaging. Of course, we had to open and taste one of the inside packages.<br /><br />2. They don't taste salty at all. We weren't thirsty after eating them. If you were stuck in a car for 2 or 3 days, these would supplement whatever you had on hand, with enough calories per pack to keep you alive, although not thriving unless you had other food or drinks, since two crackers have 140 calories in them. A pack of 4 has nearly 300 and most people need a minimum of 1200 calories per day. With a jar of unsalted peanut butter, you would have significantly more calories.<br /><br />The average person with only minor heath issues is not going to starve in two days, even on a very low calorie diet, especially if there is snow to melt and drink. That is just my take. Many people regularly fast for a day or two because of religious beliefs and as long as they are basically healthy they get by just fine. However, you'd burn off far more calories if you body was struggling to stay warm.<br /><br />With the shelter of a car and an emergency heat-retaining blanket as well as extra blankets or sleeping bags which can withstand very low temperatures, you could probably get by even if the car battery died. It would depend on how temps go and we have not tested any supplies in very extreme conditions, including heat-retaining blankets.<br /><br />3. They would also come in handy at work if you were stuck for a couple of nights in an office building, the power was out and any snack machines were either empty or impossible to easily open. Our city was struck with a blizzard like that and people weren't able to leave work for about 2 days. Food ran out, although water was readily available.<br /><br />Some that were used to eating regular meals got very grumpy when the blizzard had them facing unplanned fast. These could help alleviate hunger pangs without causing too much thirst. We found these crackers relatively filling and they did help keep hunger at bay for hours (just our experience) even though we jog every morning. You'd probably still get very hungry overnight without extra food.<br /><br />4. An entire box would only be enough for one person for about 2 days but would probably work best for only an overnight situation.  Overnight, you could manage to help 1-4 people get a snack. Again, each pack only has about 300 calories so these would be best for 1-2 people but if you had other emergency food, it could help as many as 4 people get by (and more than that, if you had extra supplemental food).<br /><br />5. They are very lightweight. You could take them on a camping trip, perhaps in a waterproof sealed container. But they wouldn't last long in a pinch and you'd need to either fish or catch other food or have some more emergency food on hand.<br /><br />To sum it up, I'd think of these only as a snack food and good for work or keeping in your automobile trunk in case of an emergency lasting a day or two. They could also be part of your camping supplies because they are so light. During a camping trip, they'd provide an alternative to other starches. It would be reassuring to know there was something to eat, however minimal, in a pinch and you could carry them in an emergency backpack as long as you had means to get more food.<br /><br />For longer periods of time without other food? Go with something that has more calories and more crackers for longer hauls.

review/summary: Works very well
review/text: I've used this litter for at least six months now.  My cats (all between 7 and 12 pounds), who were used to a very soft wheat-based litter, accepted this very easily and it actually does last a long time, although maybe not 100% as long as they claim.  I do have one cat who gets SQ fluids for kidney problems, so she probably does urinate more often than normal cats; therefore I don't feel confident arguing about the manufacturer's claims for longevity.<br /><br />The thing that surprised me the most is that even as the litter gets really old, the litter box still does not smell like cat urine.  It's not until the litter is completely saturated at the end of its life that you start to smell urine.  I have a friend who uses another brand of silica litter, and it gets the stench of urine almost immediately, so I think Litter Pearls are worth the premium for odor control.  You can still smell the cat poop a little, of course.<br /><br />One of my cats has asthma, and the vet recommended using this to lower the dust exposure for him.  This is not 100% dust free, but compared to most litters it is much closer to reaching that claim, and we love that because there was a pervasive coat of dust all over the house with the wheat-based litter.  This litter still tracks, but the cats don't emerge from the boxes with dust-covered feet so we don't have to look at dusty paw prints all over the house any more.  As for the round crystals being difficult to vacuum, there is some truth to that, especially with hardwood floors; however, I really haven't found the vacuuming issue to be terribly inconvenient, and since my cats are accustomed to soft litters, I've stuck with the round crystals.

review/summary: BETTER CRYSTAL LITTER
review/text: I have used the crystal cat litter with my two cats for the last five years.  The last few years I've used Tidy Cat's crystal litter (it was what was available at my grocery store) and also the "Just the Crystals" litter that Amazon carries.  I switched to the Ultra Pet crystals a few months ago and this litter is FANTASTIC.<br /><br />My large maine coon cat urinates a lot and when I would go to stir the crystals each morning, there was almost a slurry of wet, nasty crystals at the bottom.  After stirring up the crystals it just seemed like a damp mess.  I understand that the crystal litters are all made with silica, so there shouldn't be much of a difference between brands, but somehow there is a BIG  difference.  This litter absorbs the urine completely.  There is no "wet spot" in the litter box anymore.  I suspect this has to do with the shape of the crystals - more on that below.<br /><br />The odor control with this litter is also much better.  Both cats use the same box and the litter is lasting me a full month. By the time I notice any odor, it was already time to change the box.  There is also nearly no dust!  I'm so used to a cloud of dust rising in the air when I changed the litter box.  I assumed that was just the way crystal litter was.  There was always dust everywhere, even to the point that it had somehow managed to get inside the electronics to the automatic cat feeder.  This litter is a bit more expensive up front and the only reason I tried it was because Amazon had a $5 off coupon.  Now that I have tried it, there is no  way I would go back. Because the odor control is so much better, this bag lasts me the full month and I'm not replacing it as often as I had to do with the cheaper brands though so it seems I'm about even.<br /><br />The only negative comment I have is in regards to the tracking - and it's not that bad.  The "original" formula of the Ultra Pet litter has crystals that are round.  I have tile and noticed a bit more tracking.  I saw that Ultra Pet has other formulas, one called "less track", and another one that is "micro crystals".  I plan on giving one of those a trial run to see if I can get the same absorbency and odor control with those formulas as I have with this kind. I suspect that the slightly larger round crystals are what makes the difference though. The round crystals  allow air to circulate around them better than the other small crystals that pack together so tightly.

review/text: I've been using this litter for 6 years now.  I have one cat and one bag lasts an entire month (I scoop it every other day).  There is very little tracked outside the litter box and there is NO SMELL.  The pearls do a fantastic job eating any odor left behind.

review/summary: Great for cigar humidification!!!
review/text: Bought these to replace the Equisicat crystals and Heartfelt beads in my fridgadors and couldn't be happier. They are crystal clear, round, hold water well, self regulate around 70% RH (68 RH for me), have zero smell and are a priced right. I can't get these around the Bay Area in CA, only Equisicat crystals and like these much better. The are identical to beads that costs much more that are marketed specifically for cigar but is essentially the same product for all intensive purposes.

review/text: I love my automatic litter box! I hated paying for the expensive trays that go with it. So I purchased the forever litter tray and these litter pearls. I use the subscribe and save to get the best deal. If changed around 35- 40 uses I have no litter/urine smell. I have also used them to soak up a spill in the garage and a leak under the faucet. They work great and save me about 300 bucks a year over buying trays!

They don't clump the waste in the litter tray and they don't cover it<br />either, not like the other brands, so you see most of their poop and it smells unlike<br />the other brands and it is so hard to clean up because the little<br />pearls roll everywhere when some spills out of the litter tray after the boys have been. Hate it<br />and will not ever use this again.

review/text: This is the first negative review I've ever written, but I was really disappointed when this arrived and we tried it. We used to buy Agro Labs Naturally Pomegranate and really liked it ... It was nearly 100% pomegranate. Now it is filled with lots of other ingredients, including pear juice, apple juice, and other vegetable and fruit juices. It may have the same or more antioxidant value, but it's not nearly as tasty ... and I don't think it's worth this much money for a product that is diluted with non-pomegranate fruit and vegetable juices. We won't buy it again, and it's too bad they call it pomegranate juice!

review/text: I've been taking this supplement instead of Orange Juice in the morning or when I don't have a chance to make a fresh pot of green tea.  It's very thick and I always dilute it with water so it can last a long time.  It only recommended to keep it in the refrigerator for 2 months once opened.  I generally dilute 2 1/2 ounces of concentrate with 7 ounces of water.  The taste is really good.  I tried the Noni juice by the same manufacturer, but the Pomegranate is far more palatable.

review/summary: Brown?  Would give it a zero if I could.
review/text: Seriously .. I don't know what others are getting but the "juice" in the bottle I received has the appearance of diarrhea .. not the smell, fortunately, but certainly the look.  I'm not exaggerating .. we're talking a dense brown color here.  It's not out of date, either.  In fact, the expiration/sell-by date is 27 June 2013 so this stuff should be fine.  There's absolutely no way I'm drinking something that looks like what this stuff looks like.  It's no wonder that the bottle is completely enclosed in plastic wrap .. if people could see the color of this stuff, there's no way they'd buy it.  Also, if your Pomegranate juice includes Acai Berry, that's something you might want to include somewhere, anywhere, in the product description when people are buying it online.  In fact .. here's a list of the ingredients:  Proprietary Pomegranate Extract Blend (Punicalagin, Ellagic Acid, Polyphenol), Resveratrol Extract, Omega 3, 6, & 9, Reconstituted Pomegranate Juice, Acai Juice (from Acai pulp & Acai powder) Pear Juice (from concentrate), Apple Juice (from concentrate), Vegetable and Fruit Juice (FOR COLOR!!!!), and Natural flavor.  Wow .. I think I'm going back to Brownwood Acres Pomegranate Juice .. the ingredient list on that is pretty simple .. 100% pomegranate juice concentrate.  And the kicker .. it's actually a wonderful looking red!

review/summary: Quality of Agro Labs Pomegranate Juice
review/text: I'd previously purchased Agro Labs Pomegrate Juice and it was a rich, purplish color that was almost as strong as a dark red wine.  Accordingly, I figured the product (albeit more than just pomegranate juice) was probably providing an ample supply of antioxidants to thwart the growth or to stop the growth of cancer cells.  However, the most recent shipment of 5 bottles were either soured or spoiled, albeit they had a product quality expiration date in 2013.  And, the replacement I requested was also soured or spoiled.  Agro Labs needs to check its quality controls to prevent a future occurrence of this type.

We used to buy it at Costco, but they recently stopped carrying it which ultimately worked out better for us.  We were paying more and we had to drive to Costco.  Now we are paying less and it is delivered to our door every month. Thank you Amazon.com for making this possible.

I am always amazed that even with two cats, they never finish a half of a bowl a day. It goes to show how some people really do overfeed their pets. They seem to love it most when it is a new bag, but, they do not turn their nose up to it. It got me away from Purina products and made me a Royal Canin convert for my cats.

review/summary: Several Good Formulas - something for everyone in fussy multi-cat households.
review/text: My cats (Persian, Exotic Shorthair and Domestic) all love the Royal Canin Foods (dry). We use the "Indoor Beauty" the "Persian" formula, and sometimes the Hairball formula.<br /><br />Also they have "Babycat" kibble for weaning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YKBMSA">Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Babycat 34 Formula, 3.5-Pound Bag</a> - tiny little 'crunchies' that are even smaller than the "Kitten Food".  We adopted a 7-week-old kitten still getting replacement milk and I put a small bowl down just so she could get familiar with the smell of it.  I planned to add water to it when we made the transition from replacement milk to canned food (perhaps) and then moistened Royal Canin Babycat.  But within a few days she began eating it as is, without the water added. I was delighted that she took to it so quickly so that's in my shopping cart now.<br /><br />I gave it only 4 stars because there are a few new brands that have a higher "meat" content & less fillers, but my cats wouldn't eat any of them before or after I started them on Royal Canin.  This one works for us.<br /><br />Amazon gets 5 stars for offering these foods at a reasonable price with free speedy delivery, allowing me to save both time and money.  Good Deal!

review/summary: These croutons are awesome!
review/text: These are the perfect croutons for salads, soups and plain ole' snacking. Every single crouton is seasoned well-not too salty, not too dense. The crouton shape is perfect; small and square. In other words, they're not "tooth-breakers". My family loves these things. My only recommendation would be that if you live near a Walmart, you can buy them by the bag for only a buck! I just bought 6 bags today-3 Seasoned and 3 Italian Style. They also have Cheese/Garlic, which I have not tried yet. Give em' a try

review/summary: As good or better than wheat spaghetti
review/text: An excellent product, superior to Tinkyada in that it does not have the slightly bitter brown-rice aftertaste my family dislikes in spaghetti.  (Although in general Tinkyada - especially the macaroni - is very good.) Can be substituted for wheat spaghetti with even the pickiest eater.<br /><br />Like all brown pastas I've tried, Jovial has the advantage of absorbing sauces better than wheat pasta, giving the finished dish a deep and satisfying flavor. It also has the rice-pasta tendency to clump and/or turn mushy unless cooked very carefully.<br /><br />Here is cooking the method I recommend (adopted from the Tinkyada packages):<br />*Bring water to full boil<br />*Add pasta slowly, a few pieces at a time, stirring gently to make sure it doesn't stick together<br />*Boil gently 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently<br />*Turn off the burner, cover and let the pasta finish cooking in hot water (excessive boiling breaks the delicate pasta to mush)<br />*After 5 minutes, stir pasta and check for doneness.<br />*Continue stirring and checking just about every minute after that. Pasta is done when it is very slightly al-dente. Do *not* overcook.<br />*Drain and (optionally) rinse pasta under a gentle tap.<br />*Stir in sauce or a little olive oil immediately to prevent clumping<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Better than traditional pasta
review/text: We're a family of six.  Four of us have recently been diagnosed with celiac disease.  I had expected that our days of enjoying tasty Italian meals were over, but this pasta has changed all that.  Jovial Organic Brown Rice Spaghetti is BETTER than any pasta I have ever tasted, traditional and gluten-free included.  It cooked up in 11 minutes; no rinsing required.  The texture is similar to traditional pasta, but the taste is superior.  It was an instant hit with all six of us.  Thank you, Jovial!

review/text: I bought this for a family member and to share with a friend. Although I'm not gluten intolerant and don't *have* to eat rice pasta, I liked it. I can't tell the difference from wheat pasta although I haven't had them in a side by side comparison.<br /><br />Compared to other options, this one is excellent with no compromise. I've had rice pasta with a bad texture and corn pasta that doesn't taste right. This doesn't have those problems.<br /><br />My friend's gluten intolerant son really liked it, too. He put aside his other brands until he had eaten his way through the 3 boxes that I shared.

review/text: Marked decrease in vomiting in our 12 year old Siamese neutered male.<br /><br />I thought he had some illness, or something incurable.  Royal Canin food alone cured it.<br /><br />I am certain, as well, that the malady started when the contaminated Chinese pet food scare occurred as the vomiting started at that time and we were originally advised by a pet store owner to switch to Canin.  The store went out of business and we then cast about and found it at Amazon at a great price.<br /><br />I am glad we did.<br /><br />Highly recommend

review/summary: cat owner for life
review/text: I adopted a Tabby Point Siamese some time ago and started feeding this brand after doing research on the breed. I learned that because of the breed's facial bone structure they tend to consume their food rapidly (much like a vacuum cleaner). The Siamese formula kibble is shaped like a Cheerio and requires more chewing before swallowing. This formula helped my pet to consume smaller amounts per feeding. Another benefit is the high protein content; more per serving than other brands. Also contains L-lysine for immunity.<br />A great price too; at least $3 less than at most pet food super centers and free shipping with orders over $25!

review/text: Initially bought this brand for my newly adopted Siamese, but it works well for both the Siamese and non-Siamese cat.  They both have very sensitive stomachs and this is the only food that they seem to be able to tolerate well.  I've even tried cat food specially formulated for sensitive stomachs, but it didn't seem to help.  The Royal Canin for Siamese works for them plus they really like it.  The price on Amazon is the best I have found so far.

Litter box also doesn't smell nearly as horrible as with a lot of other foods I've tried.

review/summary: Still deciding, but so far so good.
review/text: I haven't had my cat on this food for a week yet so it's difficult to make a determination as to whether or not this food meets his/my needs.  My cat chronically regurgitates/vomits his food everyday...2 - 4 times a day. For the longest time I was focused on it being an immunity/allergy issue.  However at this point, after too many bags of expensive specialty food, it seems clear that this is a behavioral problem.  Jack is not chewing his food and he scarfs it down too quick....and then throws it back up.  How very Hollywood of him.  Jack has only regurgitated his food twice since starting Royal Canin Siamese 38.  This is already an exponential improvement.  My intuition tells me that this food will be what handles this issue for Jack - I just think it needs a bit more time to say for sure.  At this time, that's the only thing preventing me from giving this 5 stars vs. 4.<br /><br />Also I will add that, besides the obvious benefits, I especially appreciate the fact that the food is made with L-Lysine incorporated into the product.<br /><br />And to Royal Canin - THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS FOOD!!!!

review/summary: Simply the Best
review/text: We adopted a Lynx Point Siamese who had a very sensitive stomach and did not tolerate most food well.  She also refused to eat the several brands of kibble that I brought home, in hopes she, and her stomach, would like them.  Royal Canin 38 has been the best find!  She seems to love it and she has never had  a nicer coat.  We have not had any stomach issues with her since she has been on Royal Canin.  I highly recommend this product.  Ships quickly and in perfect condition!

review/summary: Great food for fast eaters!
review/text: I have two Cornish Rex cats that eat very fast and, subsequently, throw most of it back up.  I switched to this Siamese formula from Royal Canin because the kibble is designed a bit larger with a hole in the middle causing the cat to chew slower. My cats don't eat fast any more so there is no more vomiting.<br /><br />I gave it only four stars because this food is very pricey.

review/summary: Almost the cure all
review/text: I have a tabby point siamese that started vomiting at about 3 years old.  I thought it was because of the new kitten we brought home but it never went away and never got better.  I tried different kibbles, all natural, home made, cheap, expensive, nothing helped.  I finally changed his name to the "Earl of Hurl" and thought the only thing that would change it was his untimely demise from the incurable disease.  Then I stumbled upon Royal Canin 38 for Siamese.  Stuff smells like what cat prey (mice, lizards, and birds) must smell like, but it "cured" my cat.  He can't get enough and I've stopped supporting my local carpet cleaner.  We are both happy, but I still call him Earl of Hurl.  It just fits.

review/summary: Excellent food
review/text: We bought this food for our 2 year old Siamese cat after he started having problems with vomiting after eating too fast. The food is designed to encourage chewing so they don't eat so fast (common Siamese problem).  It helped significantly with the vomiting, but even with feeding him the "overweight" amount per day, he was still not losing any weight (he weighted 17.5 lbs at his weight in and has a bit of a waddle).  We have now switched him to the Royal Canin Light 40 and he is doing well.  He seems to have a little more energy than normal and loves the food. I was concerned that the smaller pieces would cause the vomiting to reappear, but he hasn't had one problem yet.  Overall the Royal Canin brand is great and I would recommend it to anyone.

I find it marginally more tasty than Timothy's similar style decaf (which is slightly bitter), but it also has a bitterness that I just do not enjoy. Strong and/or full-bodied coffee does not have to be bitter. I bought the Keurig filter so I could brew my own choice of coffee (without K-Cups). No K-Cup I have tried so far compares with Peet's decaf using the filter -- but the filter is just not convenient, and convenience is the reason why I bought the Keurig.<br /><br />I have finally settled on Green Mountain Donut Shop Decaf for my K-Cup of choice. It may not be quite as full-bodied as the Emeril's (it's actually pretty close), but it definitely does not have the bitterness.

review/summary: Nice Decaf
review/text: Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf for Keurig Brewers provides a nice coffee taste.  I have had a problem with acid reflux with some coffees in the past, but this gives me no aftertaste.  It is not too strong, not too light.  If you want a decaf, this is a good choice.

review/text: I was disappointed in this coffee.  I've had the regular Emeril's and really liked it.  I was looking for something with a stronger taste.  I like strong coffee.

review/summary: Fabulous Coffee
review/text: I love my Keurig, and I have searched far and wide for a great tasting decaf.  Until I tried Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf, I didn't think one existed.  This is without a doubt the most delicious coffee I've ever tasted, decaf or regular!!!!

review/summary: Jazzed Up and Decaf ... quite the oxymoron, but says it all.
review/text: For a decaf coffee, I personally feel that it has too much kick!  It is very strong; a lot stronger than I was searching for.  I personally drink decaf at night and prefer a subtle cup of joe.  WIth this, I was forced to add water to make it tolerable.  Secondly, be careful, I was sent a double order upon shipment accidently and now am stuck with coffee I do not like. It is very bitter.

review/summary: Jazzed up means bold!
review/text: Like this coffee occasionally, bit bold a coffee blend for regular drinking.  Can't fault the blend for this, it's more a personal taste.
