review/summary: Pretty decent coffee, if it doesn't explode... *edited*
review/text: So I pre-ordered these and had them arrive on March 5th. I did not immediately open them as I had to finish up my other batch of pod-style k-cups.<br /><br />While the coffee was on par with the Coffee People's donut shop or Dunkin's, there was one problem I had more with these cups more than any other.<br /><br />They would explode!<br /><br />It seemed to be a roll of the dice as to what would happen. It would either spit out grounds into the coffee cup or gush out the sides at the top. In either case, it always seemed to be the foil top had come 'unglued' from the cup itself.<br /><br />It got to the point where I will stand at my machine and stop the process if it gushed out the side. Cleaning up the mess afterwards was a pain.<br /><br />I don't know if I had got a bad batch since it was a new product or just the quality control of the company, but until I feel the cost outweighs the cleanup, I will hold off buying anymore from this company.<br /><br />***EDIT 06/01/12***<br /><br />As promised, they sent me a new box of coffee. After having used 10 pods, I can say it is much better than before. I only had one that ended up with grounds in my cup, but none that exploded as previously stated. So because of the efforts by the customer service to owning up to the issue and sending me a box of the updated pods, I am updating my rating to a 4 from a 3.<br /><br />Thank you.

review/summary: Don't give up on them yet!
review/text: While I had some difficulties with these k-cups and ended up thus far throwing out 1 or 2 out of every 3 or 4, they just don't work properly (similar to what many other reviews say here).<br /><br />I took the time to email the manufacturer and received a reply the same day - here is their reply:<br /><br />"We're sorry to hear you're having trouble with the decaf coffee.<br /><br />We're currently reformulating our decaf blend as decaf reacts very differently than regular coffee during the brew process and it's been causing problems in certain environments. Amazon is aware of this problem and is working on removing this product.<br /><br />We expect to launch our new reformulated Decaf Blend in 2 - 3 weeks in the meantime can I send you a free sampler variety pack as I would hate to have a customer unhappy.<br /><br />We are certain we will regain your confidence and we will do what it takes to guarantee your satisfaction.<br /><br />Thank you for your patience and we hope you'll enjoy the new reformulated blend.<br /><br />In the meantime, please send me your address so I can get it out to you today."<br /><br />For me, I am going to ask Amazon for a refund but I am going to give this company another chance based on their quick and satisfactory reply.

review/summary: Great Bold Flavor
review/text: When these were offered for pre-order, I jumped at the chance to try a new coffee at a great price.  I ordered the Cyclone and the Fuhgeddaboutit.  Both are great.  The Cyclone has a smoother taste, while the Fuhgeddaboutit is truly bold - which I like.<br />Thankfully, I have not had any of the issues that others have posted.  I was surprised to read about all the problems.  I feel like I received the same shipping lot - the first orders, so I am pleased that I have not had any explode or fall apart in my machine.  After reading about the issues, I was curious about the k-cups, so I compared them to the k-cups of Wolfgang Puck and Cafe Escapes (all I had on hand)and noticed that the diameter of the Brooklyn cups are a little larger than the other two brands - not sure if that is a problem or not. I ordered the box of 36 cups for each flavor and will be ordering again.

A lot of other people have voiced the same problem and my description is the same.  Foil comes loose, coffee cup only halfway full, and lots of grounds in my cup.  If I could rate them separately, I would give the coffee 4 stars and the cups 1 star.  I have considered busting them open and putting the coffee in my re-useable cup.

review/summary: Cheaply made, coffee just ok
review/text: I purchased two blends from this company; brooklyn bridge blend and fuhgeddaboutit. The brooklyn bridge blend was the better of the two but it is just ok. The packaging is just poor. I have brewed about a dozen cups between the two blends and nearly every one has been full of grounds or worse.I have had to clean out the k-cup holder in the machine twice because it was jammed full of coffee grounds. Some of the cups when taken out show the foil separated from the plastic. I ended up with a mouth full of coffee grounds in my last cup and decided to throw the rest away.

review/summary: Messy K-cups
review/text: I agree with many others here.  Very poor quality control and packaging.  You can actually see coffee residue embedded in the top of the K-cups, and most brews result in considerable grounds in the cup.  I have never had this issue with any other K-cup brands.  And worst of all, the coffee tastes as if the roaster simply filled it up with stale Folgers. And be aware that Amazon does not accept returns on K-cups.

I also have to say I loved the packaging from Brooklyn Bean. I like that the Cardboard box isn't flimsy. I also like the opening, makes it easy to move around without worrying about all the k-cups falling out and having to pick them all up. I love the flavor and think this is a great coffee for my tastes, I like bold and extra dark roasts. The thing I like the best is that the packages come in 36 packs instead of 12-24 packs. This way I only have to order 1 time every 2-3 weeks instead of every other week. Great product. Can't wait for more flavors.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006Q822L0">Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee, Fuhgeddaboudit, Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 36-Count</a><br /><br />Product arrived yesterday, by USPS Priority Mail, how cool is that, delivered on Saturday. Was surprised to find the product in K-styled cup format. I excepted it to be like San Francisco Bay Coffee Decaf OneCup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast, unique format, because of the much lower price. Gave it a try, liked it.<br /><br />But, Huston, we have a problem here. Say again, copy, its Brooklyn. There is a quality control issue at the packaging facility. Second cup, such a mess. The foil seal separated, or wasn't glued properly. Liquid goes everywhere, coffee grounds were coffee grounds just shouldn't be, including the in the cup of fresh brew. Now, to be fair, this happened not long ago with an Emeril's K-cup from Green Mountain Coffee and they never replied to my customer service e-mail complaint. The mess, isn't fun to clean up, trust me.<br /><br />Taking the K-styled cup apart, I find another unique design change, the filter snaps in, not glued. This will be great for refilling. But wait, there's more, in the case of this rogue K styled cup,  the filter wasn't snapped down on its seat as the first cup was. Need to fixed this NOW, or this product will go to the land of never to be heard of again, real fast. (Why K-styled cup; Green Mountain Coffee has informed, threaten, via their mighty corporate legal team, servearl providers of K styled cup refill alternitives, that GREEN MOUNTAIN COFFEE OWNS THE LETTER "K" CONCERNING ALL THINGS K-CUP)<br /><br />Hope this issue is resolved soon, like the coffee, like the Subscribe and Save price. And no,I don't live in Brooklyn.<br /><br />Ok, lets try cup number three, three's the charm, rignt?<br /><br />FLASH-UPDATE<br /><br />Brooklyn Customer Servvice came through, is trust worthy,and cares about their customers. Not only did they send replacement product, they sent a whole new box, not just a few cups, or sample box, but all 36 cups. How great is that!<br /><br />Thanks Brooklyn, love the coffee and it make outstanding ICED coffee.

review/summary: Spectacular Brewing Failures but much less frequent (caffeinated only)
review/text: Something about the Brooklyn Bridge compelled me to try this product and - admittedly - I jump all over the K Cup spectrum trying each variety. I should also note that I'm hardly a coffee expert; even gas station coffee that has been sitting for two hours tastes fine to me. The ONLY reason I'd ever write a coffee review is if something about the packaging made life difficult and this is certainly the case here.<br /><br />On our first brew in the Keurig, coffee grinds were thrown out of the top of the machine and all over the counter. When we removed the pod, the foil had actually been shifted off of the base, creating about a half of an inch slit for grinds to be pushed out by the force of the water during the brewing cycle. To be fair, we tried three more pods and each exploded in their own, creative ways. On one , the hole created in the top was massive and allowed grinds to explode out of the container (I assume weak foil allowed the hole to grow during brewing. On another, for whatever reason, only an eighth of a cup of coffee was allowed out of the pod.<br /><br />OK - maybe our brewer needed cleaning or was in a state of disrepair? We put a pod of known good Timothy's in and the machine performed flawlessly.<br /><br />I'm assuming that in this first run of product, this coffee either missed on the specification for packing for the Keurig, used some bad materials, or perhaps both. But I'd steer clear for a while. I just tried to send these back but Amazon doesn't take returns on Grocery products. I'll be calling shortly to see what can be done. As is, these are useless and a pure waste of money.<br /><br />===Updated April 19, 2012===<br /><br />As you can see, Ruth from Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee used this thread to offer to replace my bad lots of coffee of which I had two, the Brooklyn Bridge Blend and the Decaf blend. I took her up on the offer, wrote her, gave my address, and indicated that I would change my review if warranted based on the results. Although I got no response to my email, two boxes of coffee showed up about a week later. So we put them to the test.<br /><br />The first box that I opened was the Brooklyn Bridge Blend. I tried four of the pods, and each worked without issue. The coffee was tasty enough but the real measuring stick for me was 'are there coffee grounds on my counter' and the answer in this case was no.<br /><br />Alas, we tried the Decaf. The first two pods immediately blew up during brewing. In one case, grounds came out of the coffee machine and in the other, grounds filled the coffee cup. In this case, the coffee failed my rather simple test criteria.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is this company knew they were replacing bad batches of pods, had all the advanced warning that they needed to select a batch of known good quality, and we encountered the same issues as on our first purchase.<br /><br />I'm very appreciative of this company's efforts to make this right but my sense is that they have immature quality control processes and I cannot recommend this brand based on the higher than acceptable probability that you will end up with a bad batch.<br /><br />===Edit May 3, 2012===<br /><br />Ruth at Brooklyn Bean sent me a sample pack which contained seven different caffeinated flavors for me to try. I very much appreciate the efforts of this company to show their quality control processes have been fixed. I am not quite done with the entire sample pack but I wanted to post my progress for those interested.<br /><br />First, though, to Lisa Lou and others who may be thinking it, I am confident that I have ruled out machine error as a factor in my previous reviews. First, the machine was fully cleaned and de-scaled before testing and I have numerous "known good" pods from other suppliers that function flawlessly.<br /><br />That being said, I can say that these samples have performed very well. I have tested the following:<br /><br />4 Donut Shop<br />2 Cyclone<br />4 Boardwalk Blend<br />4 French Roast<br />1 Breakfast Blend<br />1 Columbian<br />1 Fuhgeddaboutit<br /><br />Of these 17, only one time (with a Boardwalk Blend) did the pod explode in the manner described in my review. It did explode fabulously - with grinds coming onto the counter and filling the internal unit (very hard to clean) - requiring a full cleaning of the machine. This happened only once, however, and this rate of failure isn't out of line with what I've experienced with other brands (they just fail in different ways - like grinds in the cup or a half full cup of coffee).<br /><br />I can say with reasonable confidence that the production issues are probably solved for the *caffeinated* flavors. I have no way of determining if the issues associated with the decaf have been solved.<br /><br />I am switching my rating to 3 Star given the spectacular (but more rare) nature of failures with this brand and given the uncertainty of the performance of the decaf variety.<br /><br />I hope this helps.

review/summary: Cheap, but decent
review/text: I order these K-Cups with the sole purpose of reducing my per cup cost. Understand I drink $60+ of coffee every month so I really need to cut back that cost. I purchased Cyclone and Fuhgeddaboudit as I am a fan of dark roasts in the Keurig. Cyclone's description stated it was the same as Dark Magic, which is my favorite K-Cup of all time. This gave em very high hopes for it. With Amazon subscribe and save it worked out to around 42 cents a cup, which is 15-20% cheaper then I pay for K-Cups normally.<br /><br />So that I can end on a positive note, let me start with the key problem I have had with these K-Cups. They seem to brew faster then the "normal" ones which yields a weaker flavor. I have not timed them, so that is more of a "seems" like then a hard number. They are weaker, and there is no good reason for that to be other then brewing to fast. You can use the manual pulsed brew with the Keurig to get around that, but that kind of goes against the convenience factor of the Keurig system.<br /><br />I measured 12g of coffee in them, which is excellent! More grinds are better, and many K-Cups only have 8-9g in them which is way to little for this format. Also I have had NO failures or issues brewing them so far. Every K-Cup has brewed with out any failings. I have heard that some have had issues with these k-cups getting grinds in their coffee, but I have not yet experienced that. My machine is a B-60 and has been rock solid since day one, and no K-Cup has given it a problem.<br /><br />Over all these are decent K-Cups, just weak when compared to the brews they claim to match. They are much much better then San Francisco Bay Coffee OneCup which I am not likely to ever by again. Plus the fact that these K-Cups have real coffee in them places them light-years ahead of the Grove Square (which is instant coffee in a K-Cup).<br /><br />Among the competition these take second to the GM K-Cups, but are way ahead of the rest of the field.

review/summary: Defective K-cups ?
review/text: I usually do not want to complain about a product but I just started using the Brooklyn Bean Cyclone dark roast K-cups and have a issue with the K-Cup itself. Seems it likes to make a real mess of my coffee maker with grounds all over the place. I have not had a problem with any other K-cup brand coffee, just this one, perhaps some problem with how they were made. The few time I could get one to work in all fairness the coffee was good, thats why I have purchased this before. I have sent a email to the company and will see how they respond, for now I would suggest holding off purchasing until the problem is resolved<br /><br />update: they responded to my email, i guess there was a batch problem afterall. Amazon shoud not ship the defective batches and return them to brooklyn. On the positive side they will be sending me replacement coffee. I will update again when new coffee arrives. I would say at least they have good customer service.<br /><br />Update 7-11-2012<br />I received my replacement shipment for the defective K cups that I mentioned above along with a nice bonus of sample k cups . Its hard to find a company anymore that stands behind their product but I can say 'Brooklyn Bean Roastery " does bu responding quickly to my problem. Customer service is still alive and well, I'm sure the coffee will exceed my expectations, the customer service sure has.

review/summary: Underwhelmed
review/text: Like other users, whose reviews I wish I'd paid more attention to, the consistent performance of these k-cups is disappointing.  Attracted to the product by its bargain price, I'm reminded you often get what you buy.  While the coffee tastes OK, it's no better than most other brands I've purchased.  This is the ONLY brand I've purchased, though, that has a defect about 50% of the time.  Coffee goes into the cup and sprays into the cup holder which ruins the beverage.  With only about half of the cups working properly that effectively doubles the cost making it anything but a bargain.  I will not purchase again and, if asked, will recommend against purchases.

review/summary: I Wish I Could, I Wish I Might .....UPDATE 07/10/12
review/text: 07/10/12 Update<br />****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />Okay, I was really disappointed with my first delivery from this company as you can read.  They contacted me about giving them another chance and I agreed. I have to say I was impressed with both the level of customer service and speed of delivery.  *5 STARS*<br /><br />Coffee Impression<br />Instead of a second batch of Colombian coffee I received a box of Brooklyn Bridge Blend.<br />First off kudos for fixing the lid problems! I had absolutely no explosions! Yea!!!<br /><br />Now the taste of the product sent.<br />My mother loves it as it's not strong. I was thrilled it was much stronger than the previous one and I received the correct amount of liquid for the setting.  The taste reminds me of my moms Nantucket blend coffee. Not bad but not really strong either. Not my personal preference in coffee.<br />As I stated, mom loved it so I am thrilled to pieces and will be ordering her a box!<br /><br />A thank you Brooklyn Bean Roastery for fixing the problems with the cups. This will now be a wonderful cheaper version to buy without a loss in quality.<br />****************************************************************************************************************************************************<br />I wish I could say something better about this coffee. I wish I might be able to give this Colombian coffee review something less than a zero. I wish I had my money back.<br /><br />Background:<br />I buy Wolfgang Puck, Donut Shop, Starbucks, & Variety packs, a lot.  I drink three or more cups every day! I also have two cups of tea, so my machine is something I know and understand. I have only had one previous bad experience with a k-cup and it was promptly taken care of, no problems since.<br /><br />Experience:<br />My first cup I pulled from the box was not sealed all the way so I had coffee grounds all in the box. I pulled out a second one inspected it, wiped the outside off and set to brew a 10oz cup. I heard hissing and thought "Oh, God!" but thankfully it hadn't burst, whew! It only filled the cup to about 8oz, it looked like the same amount as when I drink certain teas. The taste was so weak for such a small amount it was a bit like lightly flavored, colored water. Not good.  So, later I tried again but set it at 6oz like I would for my Chamomille tea. It exploded coffee grounds were everywhere! In my cup, machine and counter! No, I was not happy cleaning this crap up. That was it for me, three strikes or k-cups and i'm out I have no intention of every buying this company again!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />I hope Amazon decides to protect it's customers and stop selling this coffee.

review/summary: Doesn't Work Well in Keurig Brewer
review/text: While the flavor of this coffee is acceptable, mechanically it just does not work in the Keurig brewer.  I don't know if the problem is the size of the grind or some problem with the K-cup containers themselves, but almost every cup I have tried to make has been virtually unuseable.<br /><br />The water barely drips from the K-cup while brewing instead of producing a steady stream as other containers do. On at least two occasions the back-pressure was so high as to cause my brewer to overflow out of the top of the K-cup container because the brew could not be pushed through the K-cup as it should be.  Both holes were punched in the K-cup correctly and the holes in the needles are NOT obstructed.  I can remove the Brooklyn K-cup and insert any other one I have and it will flow correctly.  I have two brewers and the problem is the same in both brewers.<br /><br />In addition to the over-flow and back-pressure problems, every cup I have brewed has also contained a significant portion of coffee grounds in the cup, several cups have been so full of grounds as to be undrinkable.  This leads me to believe that at least part of the problem is the size of the grind.<br /><br />I've used almost half the box trying to get things to work to no avail, but I don't feel I can request a refund after using that much of the product.  I have no interest in replacement product as the flavor is not that special and I don't trust it to work any better.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this coffee to anyone.

review/text: Would be a great price, but these K-cups don't work. If I use them as I normally would, I only get about an ounce of coffee in the cup, and it is mostly grounds. Not wanting to waste my purchase, I now cut open each K-cup and put the coffee into my My K-Cup Reusuable Coffee Filter that goes with my Keurig. The coffee itself is pretty good, but I could have bought a bag of gourmet coffee for a lot less money if I am going to have to use my reusuable filter anyway.

review/summary: Improved their product...Amazon & Brookly Bean Roastery fair to customers:)
review/text: Below was my original review, but here is my updated review as of June 2012.  First off I'd like to say that I thought the company acted very quickly on their not so good reviews. I commend them for reaching out to their dissatisfied customers and giving consumers the opportunity to try their product again at no cost.  I was one of those consumers that Brooklyn Bean Roastery reached out to.  The first replacement order was better, but still not without problems similar to what I mentioned in my original review.  Weeks later I was offered another sample box and accepted.  This time around I have experienced no problems so far.  I do believe that this company acted responsibly in admitting there was a production problem and I must say that after two rounds of corrections, they seem to have the issue resolved.  As for the coffee itself, as I stated from the beginning, the taste is there, I have no complaints about the coffee itself. My favorites are the Breakfast Blend, the Columbian and the the Brooklyn Bridge Blend.  Hoping to see more light to medium blends in the future.  Thank you Brooklyn Bean Roastery for making me a proud Brooklyn girl once again:)<br /><br />P.S. I have since ordered more coffee from this company and I intend to continue as a regular customer.  The coffee is as good if not better than Keurig/Green Mountain's offerings for similar blends and the price is much better too. So if you're looking for a break on your wallet, try Brooklyn Bean Roastery's coffees, I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />***************************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I received my first two boxes of Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee for Keurig K-Cup Brewers back in April - one box of the Brooklyn Blend and another for the Columbian Blend. I was excited to try these coffees since I am originally from Brooklyn and lived half my life there - yes, a proud Brooklyn Girl. I could definitely relate to the some of the names used for their blends.  Well the excitement didn't last long.  I'm sorry to have to report that I can not recommend this coffee to anyone - whether from Brooklyn or not!  I have a Keurig machine which is well maintained always and was in perfect working order prior to using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery's version of the K-cups.  These cups have malfunctioned about 80% of the time regardless of which blend I used.  Grinds are all over including much of them in my half cup of coffee.  I have had to clean my machine countless times after trying to use these K-cups.<br /><br />I know by now you must be asking why would I continue to use them.  Well I contacted Amazon and explained the problems I was having and they offered to send me replacements.  I figured I would give them a try in hopes that they had isolated the problem cups and would be sending K-cups from a newer run of the product with the defect corrected.  Well that proved to not be the case.  Since a cup or two would actually work flawlessly now and then I was a bit determined to try and find what the problem was.  I knew it was not my coffee machine since all other brands (Green Mountain, Timothy's, Diedrich, etc) were all working without issue.<br /><br />Before I go any further, let me also say the coffee (when I managed to get a cup without grinds) was actually good.  On taste, I could recommend the coffee, but on performance and the chances of getting a cup without putting your expensive Keurig machine at risk - No, can't recommend.<br /><br />Lastly I would like to share what I found in trying to figure out the defect.  I noticed that the plastic cups are slightly thinner and more 'wimpy' than the other brands.  Next I noticed the exit hole made by machine was not as large as was made in the other brand cups.  I suspect this is because the plastic cup is too weak and collapses and therefore making it difficult for the coffee machine's exit needle to make a clean cut hole into the bottom of the plastic cup.  Without a proper exit hole I believe this changes the pressure in the cup as the machine is trying to brew.  What usually ends up happening is a lot of the grinds and water backs up and comes out the top hole in the cup - and sometimes causing the foil cover to explode.<br /><br />What I have done to try and salvage some of these cups is I put the cup in the machine as usual and allow the machine to pierce it's hole into the cup and then I remove the cup and gently widen the hole on the bottom with a sharp/pointed object, even a paper clip can do.  Just be careful that you do NOT go far up into the cup where you would be likely to puncture the paper filter.  Doing this I have reversed the rate of failure and am now getting 80% success.  Some cups still fail - those with off-centered foil covers or paper filters that are not attached.  Yes, I actually found unlike other brands, the paper filter is not always attached and can actually be moved around in a circular motion.  Most of these things are a matter of quality control I would imagine and as for the thinner plastic, that may be a matter of going too cheap on the product - just a thought.<br /><br />I hope this review has been helpful to some, especially those trying to get some use out of the product vs. throwing all that coffee/money down the drain.<br /><br />In closing, I do hope the company can correct these problems since as I stated, the coffee taste is fine - it's the product used to contain it that needs help!  In the meantime, Fuhgeddaboudit!

The coffee flavor s good when I am able to get a "good" cup. When you compare them side by side with other K-Cups you can see a difference in the packaging.<br /><br />I would not recommend this brand unless they make significant changes to their manufacturing and quality control processes.

review/summary: Very cheap & No taste-*UPDATED REVIEW*
review/text: Just received my first shipment and I must say this is awful. I am a heavy coffee drinker so I know coffee. This tastes just like the cheap stuff you buy at dollar tree in the bags. It is the least expensive kind of arabaca coffee that has no taste, not much odor and what it has is not that pleasant. I can definately see how they sell it so inexpensively. Please do not waste your money and getting stuck with the whole shipment. I have tried 3 cups and went from the regular setting all the way down to the least and it has barely gotten any stronger and the taste did not improve at all..<br />===================================================================================================================================<br />***THIS IS AN UPDATE TO THIS EARLIER REVIEW 4-27-12*** First let me say that this company and "Ruth" in customer service have been great people to deal with. Ruth has sent me a few cups of every flavor to try in hopes I would like one. I am a Coffee people Donut shop lover and the green mountain brews are also my faves and I am a heavy coffee drinker having tried every method and brew out there. I am in my late fifties so alot of coffees have passed these lips over the years. None of the brews are gourmet coffees and most of them I would not buy again. I do find the fuhgeddaboutit and the boardwalk blend the most appealing. These are in order the most comparable to donut. The other brews, Brooklyn Bridge, Breakfast Blend and Corner donut shop are drinkable but alot weaker and bland tasting with no aroma. I probably will not buy these in the future. The other brews I did not like at all. **TO the issue of Cups Exploding I only had one cup out of all I tried that left alot of grounds in my cup and that was the French Roast. (I never like french roast in any coffee anyway)I investigated as to why this happened taking the top foil off the cup rinsed out the grounds and discovered the problem. These kcups have a seperate inner filter which comes out, attached to a plastic ring. This filter is thinner and cheaper made than the regular keurig cups. Apparently when the water hit the grounds it blew a hole out in the side of the filter thus the grounds leaked out the bottom hole into my cup. This cup also had grounds stuck around the edge into the glue used to seal the cup thus it could not seal properly, even tho it appeared to seal OK. I suggest whoever this company is purchasing thier filter inserts from needs to use a thicker paper and that should solve the grounds problem. Then making sure the rim is cleaned of grounds will solve the sealing problem. As to lids being crooked Thier equipment just needs a little adjusting and that should be solved. These people have really tried and I give them top marks for thier efforts. No I dont work for the Co and don't know anyone there. I am in TN and they are in NY so there is NO connection. This is an honest heartfelt review from a regular consumer.

review/summary: All these bad reviews aren't kidding, folks - quality control on these is terrible
review/text: I love a good strong cup of coffee - my favorite K-Cup is the Green Mountain Double Black Diamond Extra Bold, but I'll try any of the extra bold varieties and enjoy most of them.  So the "Fuhgeddabboudit" flavor intrigued me and I pre-ordered a box of 36 cups.  Took about a month to arrive, and I just tried it this morning.<br /><br />First off, the people talking about these things making messes on the counter aren't kidding.  The very first cup leaked all over the place, and gave me a cup full of grounds.  I was almost reluctant to try another one - something like that can't be very good for your Keurig machine - but gave it a shot.<br /><br />It wasn't bad, but it didn't measure up to the Double Black Diamond, and since it's essentially the same price, why shouldn't I get the stuff I really like instead?  I found the flavor a little thin, lacking the richness of a DBD cup.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The real trouble is, I'm reluctant to play K-Cup Roulette with these, given that lots of people are apparently having this same issue.  I believe I'm going to contact Amazon about returning these - I'm not willing to risk screwing up my $150 Keurig with poorly-made defective K-Cups.<br /><br />The people at Brooklyn Bean Roastery need to pay a little more attention to quality control.  There's really no excuse for this sort of rampant shoddiness in their products.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon refunded my money without even wanting me to return the K-Cups.  Once again Amazon's superb customer service takes care of a problem and makes a customer happy.  If only all businesses were so easy to deal with and focused on doing whatever it takes to satisfy their customers.

review/summary: Revised again -- my wife loves it
review/text: I was fortunate to the first to review this coffee which is very attractively packaged.  (Confession: I am partial to the Brooklyn Bridge and have lived in Brooklyn.)<br /><br />Revision:  This batch was packed loose in a box without apparent damage.  I wrapped my entire machine in a white plastic bag. The cup when punctured released a pleasant coffee smell.  It brewed without incident -- afterwards the top hole was a little larger than with Green Mountain, but without noticeable side effects.<br /><br />The coffee tasted thin, weak, and burnt -- like it had been left heating on a stove stop -- worst yet. Maybe I can use them to add acid to the soil.  But -- my wife loves it -- so I am compromising and giving it a four.<br /><br />Curious, I tore it open and compared with a Green Mountain.  The foil of the BB seemed slightly less substantial, the coffee a lighter brown, and more coarsely ground.<br /><br />The filter of the BB seemed thinner, but more voluminous. It was torn, but almost certainly I did that getting it out -- there were no grounds in my cup.  The two K-cups looked similar, but BB cup picked up indentations from the fins on the bottom of the receptacle -- the GM cup did not.

review/summary: Glad I bought before I read the reviews...
review/text: If I had read the reviews before buying I probably wouldn't have ordered....so I'm glad I didn't read them. I bought one box to try it out and have had no problems what-so-ever. All of the pods in the box were sealed so I didn't have that issue that others complain about. Some of the pods are "puffy", but that also happens with other brands of Keurig Coffees - you simply put it into the machine and push it down firmly before closing the lid. This forces out the air and prevents short cupping and clogging the filter. The coffee is delicious, it smells great and for the price I'm very pleased with it. We have the Cuisinart Machine, not the Keurig branded machine, which may be part of the reason. We had alot of problems with our Keurig Platinum machine and had to replace it twice. That machine is poorly made and alot of the problems I've read about in the other reviews are symptomatic of that machine, not just poorly packaged coffee. I'll buy this stuff again.

I only realized this after thinking my machine was faulty, and purchased a new one. The same thing happened with the new machine, so the pods are just bad.

review/summary: Secret of My Energy Booster
review/text: Brooklyn Bean Roastery coffee is meant for nice flavour and taste. I used to take first in the morning as my bed coffee. I feel a very good day starts with Brooklyn coffee. I feel brisk and enthusiastic in my daily works. Relaxing with this Brooklyn Bean coffee at intervals and feeling tired. So, I regularly use this coffee in my house and office. I recommended this to my friends and relatives. They feel happy now and it acts as secret of energy booster. Price is cheap per cup of coffee when comapared to other coffees and shipping is also free to deliver on order.

review/summary: K Cups don't work right
review/text: Like so many other reviews, I must add my displeasure to the list. The cups are certainly not what I am used to using and I have used just about every brand out there. Mine either fall apart or don't brew. I don't recommend them at any price.<br /><br />UPDATE: After leaving the above review, the company rep made a big deal out of working on things to fix this issue and most importantly promised to fulfil replacement of the bad cups. It has been a month now for those replacement cups, doubt I will ever see them. No response to emails either. I still stand on what I said, "I don't recommend them at any price."

review/summary: Does not work properly in machine.  Dispenses grounds
review/text: I ordered the Brooklyn Coffee for K Cup machine.  When using I found the machice short filled and there were grounds in every cup.  The Brooklyn coffee simply does not work in the Keurig machine.  I even switched machines to see if it was the Keurig or the coffee Brooklyn single serve.  Same thing happened.  We switched to another brand of coffee and the Keurig works fine.  It is the Brooklyn single serve cartridge that is at fault.  Do not order this until they find the answer to their problem.

review/summary: Poor KCup manufacturing and OK coffee-- UPDATE
review/text: I received this last week and was surprised that there were coffee grounds all over the amazon box.  I thought it might be one of the kcups inside had broken and that was the case but it appeared that none of the kcups inside were damaged.  That being said the outside packaging looked promising, great design.  Overall I have been underwhelmed by the quality of the coffee.  It tastes old and weak.  Plus the Kcups look like they were hand done and don't have the uniformity I would expect from a professional Kcup manufacturer. I've ordered multiple different brews from the Brooklyn Bean Roastery so I'm hoping some of the next versions will be done with higher quality.  While it isn't my favorite coffee by any means it is drinkable and I'm going to try different size cups to see if I can get it to be a bit more bold and rich.<br /><br />-----UPDATE:<br />So I finally received the rest of my order Fuhgeddaboudit and Cyclone.  All of these have been less than average.  The kcup packaging is flawed in each case I received.  I also dislike all of the different coffee styles.  Each one tastes like the grounds are dry and stale.  Although I'd like to blame quality control I really think the coffee itself is just bad. Either way I will definitely not be buying coffee from this company again and I would warn everyone reading these reviews to stay away as well.  All their 5 star reviews are from people that don't have verified orders.<br /><br />I wasted my money... don't waste yours.

review/summary: Brooklyn Bean Roastery Updated Review
review/text: This is a revised review: My original comments stated I loved the coffee but there was a defect in the k-cup packaging causing grinds to leak into cups along with the coffee. After reading my feedback the Brooklyn Bean Roastery service representatives contacted me (and other customers with the same issue) and assured me that the manufacturing package defect has now been corrected and offered to replace my original order. They kept their word and after verifying my purchase order details on Amazon.com my coffee replacement was sent to me via FedEx within 48 hours! It is obvious that their prior defects have been corrected - the coffee is fantastic and the new k-cups are problem-free. So if you enjoy good coffee - give this seller another chance to satisfy your taste-buds! Amazon.com customer's review feedback is important - your comments actually make a world of difference to future customers as well to sellers and manufacturers. Always be honest!

review/summary: Gross!!!!!
review/text: I've read all the reviews about how the cups don't work properly and they brew slow and all that. Here's the thing, even if they do work properly the coffee is absolutely horrible!! I'd rather drink Folgers or Tasters Choice!! Seriously, I will never buy another product from these people again. They ought to be ashamed that they<br />even put that stuff in a K Cup. I can't believe they tried to put themselves in the same category as Tulleys or Barista Prima. I truly expected more from Brooklyn Beanery. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. I tried the "Fuhgeddaboudit" and all i want to do is forget about it!!! The "Cyclone" is even worse!!!!

review/summary: Great tasting coffee and Excellant customer Service! WOW!
review/text: OK when Amazon sent notice about a new K-cup variety availiable for Pre-order I did not hesitate. The price was right and the choices aplenty. I ordered a box each of the Columbian and the Breakfast Blend. The day they arrived I immediately had to try a cup. So I picked the Columbian , popped it into the Keurig ( as I have done a 1000 times!) and coffee grounds and water started splurting out of the sides like a fountain!! Ok so I thought it was it was just a fluke, so after cleaning up the mess , I decide to try another K-cup and the same thing happens again! This happened with both varieties consistently. This has rarely happened with any other K-cup variety I have tried since owning my Kuerig machine for 3 years now.I plan to contact Amazon about this even though they have a no refund policy on grocery items. But one thing is for sure I wont be purchasing anymore of this brand until they address this problem. I cant even comment on the taste of the cofffe.<br /><br />UPDATE!!! This company has outstanding customer service! After leaving this less than glowing  review , they contacted me! thats right! Emailed on a tuesday and had 2 new boxes on thurday! I have only tried the the Columbian(Love it!) and the Breakfast blend.Both were a very tasty medium roast that stood up well to creamer.Now that they have addresed the problem with a small batch from the preorders I will definately be ordering more. Every one of these k-cups worked perfect and the coffee is fresh and delicious.

review/summary: Forgetabout it is right! Save your money!
review/text: We're heavy K cup users at our house, and always look forward to trying new types. I was excited to see this one listed, and ordered right away.  Wow! What a disappointment! When I opened the box, there was loose coffee all over the place, and the lids look like someone sat in front of their tv and glued them on by hand. So ok, I could probably have lived with that, but when I brewed it, it was terrible--nothing like any of the others on the market. It just tasted like old stale coffee.  I tried to return it, and it's not returnable.  If you want to try an "off-brand" of K cup, try the San Franscisco Fog Chaser--it's not actually a K cup but fits into the Keurig and the coffee is good.  As far as the Brooklyn one, fuggetaboutit!

review/summary: Thar She Blows !!
review/text: Yep, another victim.  My box contained two cups that had leaked grounds.  First two in the brewer were spectacular blow outs, the next two dumped ground into the cups.  I've contacted BBR for replacements, let's see how that works out.<br /><br />Edit:  I should point out that I rather enjoy the coffee itself.  Since I have one of the Keurig inserts for brewing your own grounds, it's a matter of opening the BBR package and dumping in the contents.  The coffe has that strong taste to it that reminds me of coffe thats been brewing all day.  Similar to Coffee People Jet Fuel, I'd choose this over Jet Fuel if it weren't for the packaging issues.<br /><br />Fix the issues and the review would be a 4.

Upon opening lid the coffee was oozing out of top of K Cups and made a real mess. cleaned machine and tried it again and same thing happened.  Then tried other brand k cups and they worked perfectly as usuall!!!  Dont know if I just got a "bad batch" but all other brands work fine. I will try a couple more times and then will probably dump them...gave a couple to my friends to see what happens in their machine....still luv my CUISINART KERUIG though!!!!<br /><br />UPDATE:  The company sent me a replacement box for the above mentioned ones.....Decaf...The first one worked ok and the coffee was OK...but THEN THE SAME THINGS HAPPENED AS IN PREVIOUS POST. Have tried 5 of them they all were defective...and other brands worked just fine...So wont be wanting anymore of them. customer service was very nice but they just need to fix the cups.

review/summary: Not our cup of coffee
review/text: This site requires one to rate an item with a star system. We would have not have given any stars based upon the deceptive description of this product.<br />Should you prefer the taste of Starbucks' French Roast, this coffee pales in comparison. It does not have the "Dark Roast", "Extra Bold" taste of Starbucks' French Roast, and has somewhat of an instant coffee flavor taste. A couple of suggestions if you are looking for variety are Green Mountain's Dark Magic (even their decaf tastes good) and Coffee People's Black Tiger. Brooklyn Bean Roastery's Fuhgeddaboudit, you should Fuhgeddaboudit. They do not even provide a telephone number; only a form to fill in with your contact information.

review/summary: Poor Quality...at first
review/text: I messed up and bought a few boxes of these, and now I realize I can't return them. We've easily had to throw away half of the pods. The coffee grounds just burst out and sometimes just clog up the Keurig and nothing comes out. DO NOT BUY THESE! If there was an option to give zero stars I would. The coffee is not that great either for the pods that do work.<br />UPDATE 7/7/12: The company sent us free replacements and I'm happy to say we have had no issues with them. Coffee is pretty good too. Got to admire a company that reaches out to unhappy customers and fixes the problems. Given the effort they made I've updated my rating from 1 star to 5 stars.

review/summary: Great Coffee - Bad Packaging
review/text: I don't usually write reviews, but was compelled to advise everyone. I have purchased two different flavors. The first box arrived about a day after the coffee got released. There were about 10 k-cups that were damaged and coffee grounds were everywhere. To Amazon's credit they issued a refund. The second box was delivered with no damage to the k-cups. So I have brewed about 20 of the k-cups and around 50-60% of them are faulty. I never have had this issue with other brands. Either I get a ton of coffee grounds in my coffee or end the end of the brew cycle, when the machine blows air out it splatters coffee grounds all over my coffee cup, coffee maker or counter. I then have to discard that cup and brew another, such a waste.<br /><br />I do think the coffee is great and flavorful. I would purchase again if they would fix the issues with the k-cups. Until then I can not recommend anyone purchase this product.

review/text: I saw this brand of coffee listed as "New".  I wasn't sure if it was new to Amazon or a new product overall.  I've purchased a box and have another on it's way as I am very satisfied with the taste of the brew.  I am still on the first box that I've ordered.  I've owned my Keurig since December 2011 and have been through a large sum of K-Cups of various brands in my attempt to find my go-to-brand.  I was lookimg to contact the seller directly but since it's Amazon I was left to leave my comments here.  Now, as I've said the coffee tastes great, but not sure if it's a fluke thing as I've NEVER had this happen, but 2 of these K-Cups brewed grounds in the cup and I had another that was unable to have the hole puncture through it. I would say I am half way through a box of 36.  I will be sure to update if they problem happens again or never happens again...Anyone else experience this with any K-Cups?

review/text: We preordered the 36 count Brooklyn Bean Roastery Fuhgeddaboutit K-cup product before it was released. When the order arrived the shipping and all packaging was perfect with no damage to any part of the order. When we began to brew the individual K-cups in our Keurig brewer there was a problem with grounds in the coffee and the brewer had a tendency to clog up using the Brooklyn Bean Roastery brand K-cup. The individual K-cups all seemed to be a normal size with no apparent damage. We have owned our Keurig brewer for several years and tried a large amount of other brands and coffee types without any problem. I'm not sure if this was a bad box or bad batch of the product, but we continue to use our brewer on all other brands with no problems.

review/text: This brand of K-cups are horrible. I have a problem with grounds coming out of the top while brewing and clogging my Kuerig coffee maker. It is a pain getting all of the grounds out of the brewing area. I have only used 6 of the k-cups and 4 out of the 6 have been defective. I would not recommend them at all. The coffee itself tasted good with the 2 that I actually had work, but it is not worth the hassle of cleaning up a mess trying to use them. I have requested a refund from amazon and hoping I hear back from them within the next day.<br /><br />-----UPDATE-----<br /><br />Brooklyn Bean Roastery has a great customer service department!! They sent me a replacement box of an assortment of their different k-cups and I am pleased to say I am very happy. I have tried many different ones in the box and they have all worked great and taste good also. There were no decafs in the box, so I can not comment of how they are working now. Although, I have heard the exploding problem has been taken care of. So, I would recommend this company now. Also, Amazon's customer service is great too. They refunded my money for the bad box of decaf.

I have had a keurig for over a year and never had this issue with any k-cup over multiple brands and yes other k-cups still work fine.  maybe if this issue is acknowledged and fixed I will try from this company again in the future.

review/text: This is a very poorly manufactured product. I ordered three 36-ct boxes. The first two arrived and I tried the coffee immediately. I got a cup full of coffee grounds. Ok, once in a while, you can get a defective K-Cup. The next 5 I tried - same thing. So I carefully cut one open to see what was going on inside, and found tears in the filter inside the cup, which of course, causes the filter to rupture and shoot a large amount of grounds in the cup.<br /><br />I did eventually hit one that was ok, and the coffee itself isn't bad. But these are very poorly manufactured K-Cups. Fortunately, Amazon refunded my purchase. I'll stick with other products.

review/summary: Updated: Why These F-Cups Will Never Work Correctly
review/text: I'm no lawyer (Or am I?) but I'm pretty sure BBR can't call these "K-Cups." This is a suggestion to Ruth at BBR - you need to change what you call these in your responses - you can't say, "After all, we're filling these K-Cups with BBR Coffee."<br /><br />I'm not an engineer (Really, I'm not) but I can tell you that making something look like a K-Cup and not engineering it to work like a K-Cup is a recipe for disaster. My initial thoughts were the adhesive wasn't viscous enough, but it's wayyy more than that. The plastic is not thick or rigid enough to be punctured and rooted at the bottom of the K-Cup basket. Instead, the plastic just bends and re-forms in the basket - one of the reasons the coffee grounds are exploding UPWARD. You'll need a thicker, less bendable material.<br /><br />The foil cap isn't durable enough either, though if you replace the plastic with one that's stiffer, the foil may work. The adhesive should be upgraded to a material that can be heated, cooled, heated, cooled and never lose its qualities. You may of tested these in your office, but imagine materials that have to withstand sitting in the back of a UPS truck in Phoenix for 5 days. And after that must work in the pressure of a K-Cup basket just like a K-Cup. And you need to make sure that before sealing, you have a clean surface. Otherwise, no adhesive will work, and the adhesive is the weakest link among these materials. You do realize that steamy coffee grounds exploding can burn your customers, right? You can probably get an engineering student to intern for free to advise you, or hire an engineer. Thus ends my free advice.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~initial review below~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My 36-count box of Fuhgeddaboudit just arrived. I opened it up, wanting to brew one in the Keurig post haste. Unfortunately, after reaching in the box, my hand came out with coffee grounds all over it, and a K-Cup that looked like it never should have passed even the least rigorous quality control standards.<br /><br />C'mon, BBR! I want to LOVE your product! The coffee is delicious! I don't know who is responsible for quality control standards and testing, but these K-Cups are sub-par. Even a newb like me can see that the adhesive you're using is just not viscous enough. Surrounding every round label atop the K-Cup is a nice beard of coffee grounds.<br /><br />I like to think I'm not hard to please. I just want a product that doesn't force me to have to sweep or vacuum after taking it out of the box or removing one from the K-Cup carousel. That's the main reason I got a Keurig......I detest errant coffee grounds!<br /><br />What a disappointment - here I was looking forward to never having to send Green Mountain/Keurig another dime for K-Cups.

review/summary: Coffee good...PODS BAD!!! not all pods just these pods
review/text: So just like everyone else I'm having issues with the pods. The donut shop coffee tastes great the cyclone is ok but that is when the pods work. The over flow out the top and grounds in my coffee and the needle clogging up is a real inconvienece though. The other thing is about 1/4 of the pods in the box of cyclone I bought had the top seal partially open and coffee grounds were spilling out. I love k cups but these k cups aren't working right so keep that in mind when you make your next coffee decision. If they fix the problem and guarantee it will not happen again I would gladly buy their coffee.

review/summary: Nice cup of decaf; defective k-cups
review/text: The Brooklyn Bean Decaf Breakfast Blend is a fine-tasting, mellow cup of coffee.  My personal favorite decaf has always been Timothy's Colombian, but this is a nice, slightly milder alternative.  In fact, I couldn't tell you which of the two I like more.<br /><br />One strange issue - all the cups I've brewed up so far (we have a Keurig B70 Platinum) have brewed very slowly.  There might be an issue with the internal filter not allowing the water to move through quick enough.  No explosions or overflows, but not that great if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />UPDATE: Explosion time!  Don't you hate it when you get a cupful of grounds?  Don't think I'll be buying these again.  Oh well.

review/text: Like trying new coffee in my Keurig so I purchased the Boardwalk blend.  Love the taste of the coffee but as with other reviewers some of them what I will call exploded in the brewer.  This left quite a mess to clean up. Even though this happened will order another flavor of this coffee as I love the coffee.<br />I will amend my review after receiving a box of the Cyclone Blend.  I have brewed 12-15 cups without any problems at all.  The company has apparently solved the problem they were having  with the k cups. As I stated previously I love the coffee.  After trying the Cyclone blend I've decided that this is the blend for me.  Will continue to purchase the coffee not only for the flavor but also the cost.

review/summary: Your taste buds will thank you!
review/text: I was pleased to win a sampler box of Brooklyn Bean Roastery's eight most popular varieties (2 of each) in a contest promotion, and I can't say enough wonderful things about this ambitious new company's offerings.  From what I read here in early reviews, they got off to a shaky start with quality control in the manufacturing of the K-cups, but rest assured that I experienced no problems whatsoever.  The quality of the coffee is top notch, and the blend variety is mesmerizing.  It's SO good, in fact, that it's really hard to pick favorites, which is why I think that the most brilliant thing Brooklyn Bean could do, is offer a VARIETY PACK!  After all, not every one wants the same exact coffee, cup after cup.  Variety is what makes life interesting, does it not?<br /><br />Brooklyn Bridge Blend was the first one I tried, and my personal favorite.  It's a delightful medium roast that delights any time of day or evening, with just the right balance of body and flavor.  If I had to choose one coffee to drink for the rest of my life, THIS would be the one.<br /><br />Breakfast Blend paled in comparison, being a light roasted coffee, and initially not a standout for me.  But, my wife thought it was stellar, and could easily be a daily, easy-drinking morning favorite, even though she usually prefers darker, stronger roasts.<br /><br />Their Colombian is by far the BEST Colombian I have ever had, very complex in taste with sweet and nutty undertones.  Start your day with this, and you'll have a happy day.<br /><br />French Roast is usually not high on my list, but Brooklyn's is astounding!  It doesn't display the bitterness that I usually find with other French Roasts, and makes an excellent dark roast after dinner coffee.<br /><br />Boardwalk Blend is a medium roast, extra bold, that is best made in a larger size cup, 10 or 12 oz, and is also excellent over ice!  It won't knock you out, because it's not overwhelming in any one character, but it's a pleasant, drinkable blend.<br /><br />Corner Donut Shop is unique, in that it's not like any other company's "donut shop" blends for the Keurig type machines.  The flavor is a bit more subtle, and compliments pastries, pies, donuts (of course) any time of day.  This is a relaxing coffee, not one to shake you up, which is a good thing sometimes.  Think of it as the "comfort food" of coffees.  Medium roast, extra bold, make this in a larger size cup, also.<br /><br />Cyclone, named for the iconic Coney Island roller coaster, is a kick in the pants coffee.  Strong, bold, daring and a thrill-ride of complex, intense flavors, circling your palette, with each sip being a new thrill ride.  Yes, you'll want to ride again!  My wife has called this the "Guinness of coffees", with chocolaty undertones and full-bodied texture.  Definitely make this in a larger cup, being both a dark roast and an extra bold cup.<br /><br />A Brooklyn uniqueness, Fuhgeddaboudit, is another dark roast extra bold blend that leaves no doubt in your mind that you're drinking a cup of COFFEE!  This will wake you up out of a coma, folks!  Only in New York could they possibly come up with something this brash, cosmopolitan and interesting.<br /><br />I rarely drink decaf, but would like to try BB's, and feel the same about flavored coffees, like their Maple, Hazelnut and Vanilla offerings.  But, in short, we're so fond of Brooklyn Bean coffees, all of them so far, that it really is a tough choice to shop for a 36 count box of any one blend.  This is why it would be astounding, if they offered for sale, variety packs!  Keep up the great work, Brooklyn, I predict that this will soon be the #1 K-cup coffee on the planet!

The brewing performance was improved - one of the first eight passed through some grounds, but not a total blowout.  Found I had to brew a smaller cup than normal for acceptable flavor, and even so the coffee had a certain 'hollowness'.  Not sure if it was just weak coffee, or the result of their filter system.

review/text: Fuhgeddaboutit (or as I like to call it "unspellable") is a really good dark brew.  Considering it's price it's about to become a staple.  Cyclone and the French Roast are pretty good dark brews also.  I'm unqualified to comment on the lighter roasts.<br /><br />What I like most is the company.  I wrote a review on k-cups I didn't even purchase and Brooklyn reached out to me in an attempt to make it up to me; as if I was an actual customer, not a lot of companies would do that.  They sent me a sampler pack.  I'm very impressed with both Fuhgeddaboutit and the company. So today I go to Amazon to purchase a box and they are sold out.  What a cruel twist.

review/summary: Worth another try!  Update to previous reviews.
review/text: Tried this coffee based pretty much on the assumed introductory price.  I was a little skeptical about trying this product based on the reviews, due to the explosion issues.  Reviewers didn't rave on the taste too much however.  So after receiving these cups, I gave one a whirl, and had no problems brewing it.  I did notice that the box that they were packaged in could use some (might I say) environmental saving upgrades, and the box itself was a bit rough shod.  Also I examined a few of the K-cups and there seems to be a vacuum issue with them.  Some looked as if they were ready to blow up right in my hand, as they were so full of air, or whatever it is inside them, they were like a balloon that when over blown with air, it could explode in your face at any second.  The others seemed like they had no air or nitrogen or what ever inside. Cups could be squished and squeezed and the foil top would just waffle back and forth.  So that seems to be another quality control issue, with the vacuum packing and sealing process. Perhaps that may lead to the product quality itself once made in the cup.  I really don't think I have had the same consistent taste with one of these cup yet.  My first cup was rather weak, as in it tasted like I had run twice as much water through it than I should have.  Really had a watered down taste.  The following few cups weren't much different.  I am using a controlled amount of water, but the consistency of the coffee that gets filtered into the cup seemed to be all over the place.  There have been a couple of cups that seemed to be almost "just right" but still on the weak side, given this is supposed to be a medium roast.  I mean, I've had medium blends that taste like French Roast, but this I would really have to classify as a very light roast.<br />Too light for me, so I'm sure if I re-order, I'll try a stronger blend.<br />That being said, I think these guys at Brooklyn Roasting Co. are on the right track, and I do hope they can find a way to keep the price down.  If so, and assuming I can find the right roast for me, I might stick with them for a while.  If the price goes up, where it's tooth to tooth with the big boys, I'm afraid the big boys will win me out.<br /><br />Update 8/15/12. Well, just when I thought this problem with exploding cups was solved...BOOOOM!!! Coffee grounds everywhere!  YES, It happened to me.  *I'm trying to insert a photo, if I can figure that out. I'm pretty confident though that this will be my last purchase of these Brooklyn k cups.  It's one thing to have a passion to go after a piece of the K cup Pie, but if you can't do it right, don't do it at all.  This company (based on several buyers and reviews, even before I happened on to these "cheaper" cups) had plenty of chances to get it right.<br />*Apparently Amazon or this company will not allow additional photos, as I tried to post an image of the exploded cup sitting in my machine.  My guess is they would have far too many photos of the dastardly messes.<br /><br />Update 9/03/12.  Ok, Based on the fact that this company is serious about hanging in there, and making things right with their customers, I am giving these guys another "college try".  After the exploding cup, they very graciously sent me replacement cups.  I did not ask that they be replaced, or demanded that they redeem themselves, I merely reported the problem, along with a photo, and next thing I knew, they were asking me for more info, about the product that I had, and then told me they would send some replacements. Again, I did not solicit these, but a few days later, a very generous offering was delivered to me.  I am really excited to try out all of the other flavors now, as the sent a sample box of several different flavors.  My wife and I have already tried a couple of the new flavors and so far they were quite good.  My wife really liked the Vanilla blend, and wants me to order a box of that alone.  I had the french roast, and thought it was pretty good as well.  The cups performed nicely and I'm looking forward to trying all of the others.<br />So I suppose that as I am always willing to give things another shot, I really think that this company is truly trying to deliver a great product, and is doing the right thing by taking care of it's customers, one cup at a time.<br />The only thing I'm still a little skeptical about is the pricing seems to be creeping up, closer to that of the big brothers in the business.  I was really hoping that they could keep them below .50 cents a cup, but are already surpassing that.  Pricing will be they main drive factor for me if these cups provide consistent and equally good or better coffee to that of the original players.<br />All that being said, I'm upgrading the star factor.  Thanks Brooklyn for taking care of me.  That was unexpected, but very welcome!

review/summary: Good Coffee, Bad K-cup
review/text: I bought the fuhgeddaboudit cups, and the coffee is great, a very dark and flavorful roast with no bitter aftertaste. The k-cups themselves, however, have a tendency to explode, leaving a watery, coffeee-ground laden mess everywhere. The problem is the plastic on the bottom of the cup, it's either too thick, or a different material from most other k-cups. When you close the machine, the needle that is supposed to pierce the bottom of the cup sometimes fails to pierce the cup, but rather causes it to indent. The top needle has no problem piercing the top foil. The result is similar to trying to rinse the left over peanut butter out of a measuring spoon by putting it under the faucet running full blast. There is an easy way to prevent this from happening - if you manually push down the k-cup when you put it in the machine and make sure you feel the pop of the needle piercing the cup, you won't have any problems.<br /><br />That being said, the coffee is very good - will buy again.

review/text: I wanted to try a new coffee company and found Brooklyn coffee on Amazon. I have tried almost all the Kcups out there and I prefer extra bold type coffee. The Brooklyn extra bold coffee was strong, but not too strong, and had a full bodied aroma and flavor which I really appreciated. The box design is pretty cute as the flap opens up to become a dispenser.<br /><br />I was concerned when I read the reviews about the Kcups exploding/imploding but I am happy to report that I have had no issues brewing the Kcups in the Keurig machine. Hopefully, future reviewers can confirm that the quality control issues are in the past for Brooklyn Kcups. I liked the coffee and will buy another box soon.

review/text: To be honest, I had never heard of this brand till I won a contest and they sent me a free sample box to try and was shocked when I received a box of 16 cups. Great start to a sample pack and of course I had to dive right in and start testing the different flavors. Every single one I have tried except the french roast (not my style) was great. They all had full body flavor and a great taste. The only downfall I would say is that I ending up getting coffee grounds in most the cups which is why I only gave 4 stars but if that was fixed it would be a 5 star product. As someone else mentioned that they seem to brew slower than normal, it was a great experience (minus the grinds). Thank you Brooklyn Roasters!

review/summary: Great Dark Coffee
review/text: I usually don't drink dark coffee, or write reviews for it. This coffee has so much flavor without the bitterness (i do use half & half with sugar). I really enjoyed it, and was surprised!

review/text: I am on auto ship and my 2nd box sb arriving soon.  No problems with the first box and the taste is pretty good on these.  They must have worked out their initial issues as my kcups all worked flawlessly.

review/summary: Really clean flavor - delicious hot or cold.
review/text: I won a sampler pack from a Brooklyn Bean Rostery promotion. Having never heard of them but being a gourmet coffee lover, I was delighted to try them. The flavor of the cyclone is intense. So carmelly (is that a word?) and very rich. I loved it! Perfect with a light pastry in the morning.<br /><br />The breakfast blend was super good both hot and cold. I brewed a standard hot cup on my keurig and poured it over ice with a little creamer. It was absolutely delicious.<br /><br />I'm not quite done the pack but am definitely impressed! These aren't your typical bitter starbucks or overpriced Gloria Jeans. The best compairson I have found are the Emeril K-cups, and although being in the Delta I'm a fan of rich chicory coffee (the only thing I can find missing from the BBR selection) these are a better every day blend.<br /><br />Happy drinking! :)

review/summary: No Exploding Pods
review/text: To be honest, I ordered this because of the price, but I have to say we haven't had any really bad experiences.  We've gone through two 36 packs at this point, and once or twice there's been some grounds in the brew - a slightly better record than Gloria Jeans'.  No sign of off-popping lids or anything like that.<br /><br />Flavor-wise it's a good medium roast that doesn't taste watery on the high setting.  I think it's better than anything of Gloria Jeans, and compares favorably to those 'morning blend' sorts of things you get from Green Mountain or Newman's Own.  I just wish they offered a hazelnut blend.<br /><br />Update July 30 -<br /><br />At this point I should probably raise my rating to five (or even six) stars - you just can't beat the quality of these K-cups at the current price point, which is incredible.  If Brooklyn Bean DOES bring in a hazelnut blend I'll HAVE to go up a star - though my tastebuds still yearn for the IMHO now wildly overpriced Van Houtten blends...<br /><br />Anyway, we've now tried the Corner Donut Shop, Boardwalk Blend, and Colombian K-cups with nary an exploding pod.  Irritatingly my wife preferred the Boardwalk blend, which is now discontinued, but the other two have been just as good as their Green Mountain, Newman's, or Timothy's equivalent, and are a much better brew than those San Francisco Bay pods which are weak on the high setting.  I've tried A LOT of the different brands out there - some are pretty good, but at this time you can't beat Brooklyn's price/quality ratio.<br /><br />Update August 25 -<br /><br />I sometimes have to revise my reviews, so here we go: I still like this stuff and will continue my subscriptions - but we HAVE had a couple problems.  I DO mean a couple - we have had two pods bleed grounds heavily, and one sort of jammed somehow - hot water backed up in the pod, only a half-cup poured through, and when I took out the pod I was almost scalded.  However we've gone through half-a-dozen boxes of Boardwalk, Donut Shop, and Colombian, so I'd say the odds are pretty good.  There's still no sign of any "exploding pods."

review/summary: New favorite kcups!
review/text: I just got a Keurig and was browsing through the endless options of kcups when I found this fun brand, Brooklyn Bean Roastery! I actually tried these on a whim because the brand name and images were so appealing. Thank goodness I did! I love the donut shop kcups! They are perfect for my morning coffee, full of flavor with out being too strong.<br /><br />I highly recommend you give this one a try! I can't wait to try some of their other kcup choices too.

review/summary: Good flavor
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying I drink iced coffee on the "4" setting of my cuisanart.  I liked this coffees flavor and the aroma a lot! It had my whole kitchen scented delicious (which is rare with a k cup and is one of the only things I miss about more traditional brewing).  The only down fall was that there was loose grinds in the packaging and they seemed to leak a little during brewing.  Maybe I am not as picky as others, but the flavor & cost far outweighed that small leakage.

review/summary: Like Going to Vegas
review/text: I frequently drink the Nantucket blend, and thought I would give the Brooklyn Bridge Blend a try, based on favorable comparisons. While the price is better, the quality is not. I found that I could only use the medium cup size on my machine or the coffee was too weak for my liking. This was not a problem with the Nantucket blend, so simply based on serving size, the savings go out the window.<br /><br />The flavor (for a medium size) is good and it compares favorably with Nantucket and some other blends I have tried. However, as a number of other reviewers have noted, the cup brews VERY slowly, and in fact, my machine stops about 50% of the time and pauses for up to a minute before the cycle resumes. Additionally, I get grounds in my cup about 50% of the time, from just a few to "pour the cup out and try again". Nothing explosive like one of your reviewers, thank goodness.<br /><br />Because of the inconsistency, it is, as I said, like going to Vegas. It was worth a try, but I will not buy this brand again.
