review/summary: Lacked flavor
review/text: The entire purpose of this product is for it to flavor water and on the commercials they make it look like it will create a drink similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9U6">Crystal Light Peach Tea Drink Mix (12-Quart), 1.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a> but in reality it falls very short. We followed the instructions and after adding the proper amount of MIO to the water we tasted it. The flavor was barely detectable so we tried adding more drops. I think we ended up adding three times the required number of drops and still did not have an adequate flavor in the water. Therefore, we can no recommend this product. The only reason we are giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is that we wonder if this problem is with the entire product or just this flavor.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious Mix I Won't Be Purchasing
review/text: What a great tasting drink mix!  It's by far the best I've ever tried, but I won't be buying or using it because of its ingredients.  Here are the ones that trouble me:<br /><br />1. Propylene glycol is a humidifier used in corexit, anti-freeze, deodorants, and many other products you don't want to eat (although it is approved for use in human and dog foods). Sensitive children may have an allergic reaction to this ingredient.<br /><br />2. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener that combines sugar and chlorine.  Although the manufacturer claims many studies show the safety of Sucralose, I have not been able to locate or read those studies.<br /><br />3. Acesulfame potassium is a sweetener often used in combination with Sucralose.  A 2010 study from Drexel University (find it in PubMed) indicated that safety studies were not sufficient to prove the safety of this ingredient.<br /><br />4. MSG has been given new names, among them "natural flavoring."  Could it be that this mix contains MSG?<br /><br />5. Red and blue dyes tell me that this product is aimed at children, and its great flavor means it will probably be a favorite among youngsters, the ones most likely to show effects from these ingredients.<br /><br />I had hoped that this drink mix would not be a chemical cocktail.  I was wrong.

review/summary: not for those who like flavor
review/text: This is a good product if you can't stand to drink regular water.<br /><br />I'm not sure who doesn't like water, but I can think of several occassions during which I drank wanter that was so unpleasant, that masking it with something equally not pleasant but colorful might've convinced me that I was drinking something satsfactory. For example, when camping or when in Mexico, one is usually faced with the choice of drinking detestable, diarhhea-causing water. During such occassions it's useful to trick one's body to drink the water by adding a product that contains preservatives and dies (yellow-6). A product that in tongue-in-cheek way lists "natural flavor with other natural flavor" on its bottle, and proceeds to list "less than 2% natural flavor" on the back cover in the ingredients list.<br /><br />Still, if you are into coloring your water, this product comes in a BPA-free container that's great for on-the-go -- it is really lightweight and can fit in the palm of your hand, yet is good for 24 cups. According to the directions one quirt of the substance is enough to color 8 oz of water. In fact, the design of the bottle is one of its better selling points - it's very sleek.<br /><br />How does it taste? Like sugar water. To me, regardless of how little or how much I add, it doesn't taste like mango or peach. It's color is very light red, as if you put blood oranges into your cup and diluted them with about 1907897807850 gallons of water.<br /><br />Also, I'm not sure if this is indicative of the brand or amazon, but my bottle has a relatively fast expiration date - February 26, 2011. Moreover, according to the product label, once opened the contents of the MIO bottle should be consumed within a week.

It's easy to use, the taste is fantastic, and even the kids think this is cool. You control the amount of product in your drink so everybody can get their desired strength of flavor. I also love the fact that I can take this along in my purse and enjoy it any where I go. So far Sweet Tea is my favorite flavor, but I plan to try all of these.  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: Very convenient for travel; we keep several in the car.  Also great for hiking.  Simply flip the top, tip it over the top of your bottle, and squeeze.  It has a flexible, rubber-type opening which holds the liquid in until you squeeze.  Very easy to use even in a moving vehicle.  No spills!  Variety of flavors available and we like them all.  Do with they had one that was sweet but unflavored, for adding to tea and coffee!  Calorie free.  My kids love them.  The mango peach is one of our favorite flavors, and isn't often found in other similar products.

review/text: Both my husband and I liked this product. I didn't notice the artificial sweetener but he did. He still thought it was good and that's saying something. I cannot emphasize how much he hates artificial sweeteners. But he liked this enough that he's planning to buy some for his office at work.<br /><br />Depending on how much of a sweet tooth you have, you might go through this at a different rate. It's very easy to use. You just squirt in your preferred amount of flavor. I did a small glass at first and didn't even have to stir.<br /><br />It has no carbs so it will be great for a low carb diet.

review/summary: Not to My taste
review/text: I wanted to like MIO. The peach mango taste was disappointing. I tried more concentrated taste, which was only more disappointing; and less, which was faintly disappointing. Other members of my family also tried it, to see if it was just a taste thing I lack, and no one liked it enough to take a second sip. The flavor reminds me of the smell of a sweaty steam sauna.

review/summary: As good as the Berry Pomegranate flavor
review/text: My local grocery has four different flavors of the MIO liquid, but not this flavor. Out of the those that they have, the Berry Pomegranate is the clear winner. (The sweet tea tastes "off", the watermelon is weak, and the Fruit Punch tasted a bit too much like dye.)  So I was eager to try it this one.<br /><br />It came, and the kids and I all had fun trying it...and we all liked it, just as much as the Berry Pomegranate! It's got a nice amount of sweetness, and it's natural-tasting as well.<br /><br />These little things really are nice for those who know they don't drink enough water but who (like me) don't care for the taste of water all that much. I like to keep one in my purse, so if I'm at a fast-food place and I want to be good and avoid soda, I can just ask for a cup of water, then squirt a bit of flavoring into it. These are also great for masking the plastic taste that bottled water all-too-often has.<br /><br />The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is because somehow, if you drink two or three glasses of water with this, or if you squirt too much in, then your mouth can feel slightly dry. I'm not sure why that is, and I don't notice it with just one glass of water.<br /><br />Yum!

review/summary: Light, refreshing, and versatile
review/text: Rounding out the (thankfully now expanding) lineup of flavored drink options for those who can't or don't want to go with something sugary comes Mio, which offers a clever twist by giving you control over how strong your drink actually ends up.<br /><br />The Mango Peach flavor is light and refreshing, and isn't an overpowering taste at all.  If anything, the "mango" aspect isn't even very prominent, landing more on the "peach" side. For those who didn't like the Peach Tea flavor, this one has much less of an artificial chemical taste.<br /><br />Because the Mio flavors are liquid instead of powder, it's easier to experiment with different types of drinks.  I've used it in Airborne or similar vitamin C mixes that don't taste great on their own, and it can even work well if you let loose a few drops into a shot of clear liquor like vodka.<br /><br />As with all the other varieties of Mio, your particular mileage may vary depending on how much is used in any given glass of water.  It's not hard to go through the entire bottle quickly if you like a lot of flavoring added, but on the flipside the bottle may lost forever if you only put a few drops in at a time.

review/summary: Not appealing at all.  Will stick with Crystal Light and Snapple
review/text: I am a Crystal Light peach tea fan so I was anxious to try this. My gold standard is Snapple diet peach.  Occasionally they come out with a Mango/Peach which has been excellent.<br /><br />Crystal light relatively closely approximates the Peach version.<br /><br />It seemed like Mio it would be convenient to use.<br /><br />First I had trouble with the packaging.  It was hard to appropriately tear the plastic cover off.  I also had trouble with the directions.  I am 49 and my near vision is going the way most people in their 40s goes... I can't read the directions without finding reading glasses.  Could the manufacturers possibly consider their over-40 customers valuable and print just a little bigger?!<br /><br />My first squirt of the liquid went past the glass.  Ok.  So that will only happen once but..  Although mixing crystal light powder doesn't bother me and I am sure this is a liquid version of something similar, squirting the brown liquid into the water was not appetizing.  I felt like it was a chemistry experiment.<br /><br />When I drank the tea, I continued to think of it as a chemical experiment.  It tasted "chemically"  Again, just not appealing.  I admit I may have been influenced by the "squirting in" process.<br /><br />It is not something I will buy again.  I will stick to Crystal Light and Snapple.

review/summary: OK taste but you need to add a lot.
review/text: I'm a fan of drink packets you add to water. They are convenient and inexpensive. When Mio first came out, I thought the idea was pretty cool and I finally was able to try it. The bottle says to add a squirt for 8 ounces of water. I put one squirt in the bottle and it tasted really gross. I added a second squirt and it tasted a bit like Vitamin water which I'm not a fan of. I added a third squirt and the taste was where I feel like it needed to be. Overall, the taste isn't strong. It has a light mango peach flavor. Although it's refreshing, I think the taste is just OK. After trying the Mio Mango Peach, I really don't care to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Surprised that I like it
review/text: I confess to having been skeptical. It is artificially flavored and sweetened, neither of which I care for in general. But I was impressed by this product's taste -- enough so that I subsequently bought all  the other flavors from Amazon. These are extremely concentrated -- when you squirt some into a bottle or a cup of water (which is the only use I intended, to help me drink more water), there is an immediate very strong aroma that is recognizable despite being artificial. The taste is also plausible to me, despite being artificial.  I like the whole concept of being able to add as little (in my case that's very little) or as much (I bet the artificiality gets more pronounced at higher levels) as I want. Finally, I like the container shape, which is excellent for traveling. I never thought I'd say this, since I have always hated artificial sweeteners, but I find this product (all flavors) palatable and entirely satisfactory for my need to drink more water.

It's easy to carry in my purse so I can use it to flavor my water at work. It's much handier than the little powder packets and you can add as much flavor as you want. Not to mention, you don't have the powder flying up in your face when you pour it. It's easy to control. It won't leak out when you tip the bottle. You have to squeeze for any liquid to come out. I heard that fruit punch is the best flavor and may try it sometime. I like Mio because flavoring my water gets me to drink more water and Mio contains 0 calories.

review/summary: Best when used sparingly
review/text: I've used MiO since the summer. It's easier to use than the Crystal Light singles (which don't always open easily and can stain your hands), and while I only like only Crystal Light flavor, I've now got two MiO choices--my original favorite, Berry Pomegranate, and as a result of this Amazon Vine selection, Mango Peach.<br /><br />I always keep a MiO bottle in my bag, to use when water has an "off" taste or isn't cold, and I recommend you do the same. Though the directions indicate you can use as much or little as you want, the recommended amount is a full squirt. For me that's far too much, even for a large glass or typical water bottle, so I suggest you add a little to your water at a time until you determine how much works. If you test it the other way, you may end up making a pitcher rather than a glass, or needing to dilute a water bottle somehow.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: It is nearly impossible to get my teenager to drink water, so these Mio flavor enhancers are a lifesaver in our house! I personally prefer the peach tea one because it has a more natural flavor, and I think this one is a bit sharp on the throat if you use enough to get a good flavor (not really a burning sensation but you feel it, if that makes sense). My younger son doesn't like them at all because he feels they're either too weak and they bother his throat if he makes it strong enough. We now have five flavors in the house to give my teenager variety and to keep him drinking water. They are definitely worth a try, as each person will have individual tastes.

It tastes a little better than Chrystal Light, mixes better, and is easier to adjust to have a lighter or fuller flavor.<br /><br />The top of the teardrop container flips open, turn it upside-down, and squirt a fine stream of MIO into your water, or whatever food or drink you like.  I used short squirts in water, so I could try to get a consistent amount of flavoring next time.  For a pint of water, I preferred eight quirts.  Just one squirt will color the water and give the slightest hint of flavor.

No artificial sweeteners (which I do use rather than sugars, but try to keep to a minimum), very convenient.  This is a vine product so I didn't pay for it but I will definitely buy more when this is  gone.<br />I've tried several options and the only thing that I like better is a squeeze of fresh lime which is NOT convenient to keep in a drawer at work.

review/text: The concept behind MIO -- adding as little or as much flavor to bottled water as you want -- is a great one. And the packaging is stylish and cute.<br /><br />At around $6 for an individual bottle (give or take), you can flavor many bottles of water. However, if I want flavored water, I'll purchase the individual powder packets that actually contain other vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />(Maybe I'm biased, though, because I think spending money on bottled water is silly and a waste of money. Spending additional money on "flavor drops" seems even more odd.)

review/text: I have become more conscious of products with artificial sweeteners in them, and while the peach MIO tastes good, it falls within this "strange chemical" category that I choose to avoid, particularly because I am a woman of child bearing age. The third ingredient in this product is propelyne glycol, which is a petroleum-based chemical in the glycerine family, and variations of this are used in hair creams an cosmetics. There is also a sugar substitute that is 200 times stronger than sugar (acesulfame potassium) and is thought to cause cancer. No thanks!<br /><br />Its a shame because I like the overall concept and packaging of this product, and would be a great product if the the ingredients werent so scary.

review/summary: Cost-effective, delicious, and my family loves this flavor. Easy to store, too.
review/text: For a tiny little container, MIO includes quite a bang for the buck! The most important factor, of course, is taste and everyone in my family loves this flavor. We can add it to tea or lemonade or simply enjoy it in a chilled glass of water. In winter, it is the perfect addition to yogurt or oatmeal, adding variety to these basic products.<br /><br />Soft drinks can take up space and the packages can be difficult to lug but even those with limited space can find room for a MIO container. We have a small desk organizer with several MIO containers neatly arranged in a row. The organizer takes up about 6 inches or less, front to back, in a cabinet, and even less width-wise. Compare that to the space required by soft drinks.<br /><br />If you like to have something on hand to add to water while working, this is convenient to keep in a desk drawer and eliminates the noise of a pop can being opened in a shared office space.

review/summary: Really has a nice taste
review/text: This water enhancer by MIO is really, really good.  The flavor in question is "Mango Peach" and I found that these two flavors balanced very well together.  The first flavor I tasted was mango and then chased by peach.  It was also nice that is no aftertaste with this product.<br /><br />The application is simple; just fill a glass with water, squirt a shot or two of this liquid enhancer and stir.  Personally, I use less than recommended because I don't want an overbearing flavor.  Nevertheless, an individual has the ability to make their beverage as mild or strong as they wish.  I also like the "non leak" packaging.  The only way the liquid comes out is if the container/bottle is squeezed.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good product with a good taste.  I have already tried the strawberry, peach tea and look forward to trying other flavors.

review/summary: Product arrived spilled.
review/text: When I got my package, my bottle was apparently squeezed during shipment and had spilled a bit :\<br /><br />What I did notice was that if you turn the product upside down with the cap off, it DOESN'T SPILL. Liquid comes out ONLY when its SQUEEZED which is why mines spilled in the upright position during shipment.<br /><br />My flavor was Mango Peach but it didn't taste like mango or peaches, it taste good but the taste is hard to describe. It kinda has a artificial taste and it definitely leaves you with that 'artificial coloring aftertaste' in your tongue when done.<br /><br />The suggested serving of 1 squeeze per 8oz serving is not enough, and you need more squeezes than that, it claims 24 servings but that number I think is an overstatement unless you like very faint flavor. 1 squeeze gives you faint flavor. 1 squeeze gives you no taste while drinking it, just an aftertaste.<br /><br />I can't really recommend this product for others since I don't see myself purchasing this product in the near future.

review/text: I prepared this according to directions on the bottle:  One squeeze of MIO liquid (about 1/2 teaspoon) in an 8 ounce glass of water.  I was put off by the color immediately:  Why this stuff has to have so much artificial coloring in it is beyond comprehension.  I guess the manufacturer thought people might believe they're drinking something that tastes like peaches if the liquid has the color of a ripe peach skin.  Guess what?  This product doesn't taste like peaches or mangos.  I just tastes sweet.<br /><br />This is basically the adult equivalent of Kool Aid.

review/summary: Good Concept, Bad Execution
review/text: I regularly drink herbal iced teas at home, but I also bring powdered flavor packets and bottled water to drink at work.  I much prefer the flavor of real iced tea, but flavored water can be a good convenient and cost effective drink while away from home.  The MIO flavoring is a good concept for flavoring water easily since you don't have to deal with messy powders  (which often seem to spill and go everywhere), but it has some flaws that keep it from being a great product.<br /><br />I have tried two different flavors of MIO, and those were the Mango Peach and the Peach Tea.  The Peach Tea is much better than this one.  The mango peach flavor has an unbearable acidic aftertaste that is like a really unpleasant citrus kool-aid.  Ugh, I can feel my heartburn forming even now.  However, I could probably make myself drink it if it were a great value...<br /><br />So, let's talk price.  These things are not cheap.  They are about $5 a piece and even though they flavor multiple drinks, I ended up having to use two whole squirts to get it to an acceptable flavor level.  This is more than their recommended amount of one squirt.  So, really, the value is not that great here.  Honestly, though, the acidity is so high and unpleasant here that I'd recommend just staying away from this flavor.  If you are interested in MIO despite its price, just try the Peach Tea one because it has much less acidity.

review/text: This MIO Mango Peach is the only flavor MIO product I have tried.  The taste is nice, but sometimes has a mild chemical aftertaste, but generally only when I mix it a bit stronger -- probably my fault.  What I do like about the MIO is that it is so simple to add it to a bottle of water and you can change the concentration to suit your taste that day.  I don't care for plain water, so I often carry around the Crystal Lite foil packets of powder.  The MIO product tastes every bit as nice and is simpler to use.  Good product!

review/summary: Yeah, adds some nice flavor but chemical after-taste...
review/text: Yeah - not so much.  MIO Mango Peach liquid 'enhancer': just add to water for a bit of 'nice' flavor and you're all set...but, in my opinion, although the taste is reasonably pleasant, the chemical-like after-taste and the chemicals inside that you are putting in your body, are what made me decide not to use this again.  I added about 3 squirts to a bottle of water, which created a bright orange cherry red color (too much chemical coloring!) and a pleasant taste of mango peach, but also created an after-taste of chemical sweetener.  I tried it on a few different ocassions, with the same results.  As someone who used to drink liquids with sweeteners, this would not have bothered me before, but it's quite noticeable to me now.  I would recommend adding fresh lime or lemon to your water instead.

review/text: But since I'm the one typing this, I get to say how many stars. Hahahaha. I dislike it - it tastes very fake and chemical like to me (I've been avoiding artificial flavors and sweeteners for awhile now, I can taste them very strongly). My husband is OK with it. He's used to drinking diet drinks, so the taste is not far off. He doesn't like how it dispenses, it's hard to get the right amount for a bottle of water. It's convenient for him to carry around for work. (We recently found out that artificial sweeteners cause his blood pressure to rise - he won't be using this anymore). Our kids like it - they love the novelty of it most I think.<br />So bottom line, if you're used to drinking diet drinks or using artificial sweeteners, you'll probably like it and find it convenient.

review/summary: Tasty, Uses Natural Flavoring, But Don't Care for Artificial Sweeteners & Coloring
review/text: My daughter loves this stuff.  I thought it tasted pretty good, loved the portability of it, and found the packaging fun.  Initially, I was excited about seeing the words natural flavorings on the front.  Not thrilled when I saw that there are artificial sweeteners and coloring added though.  Wish they could have used stevia instead of Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium.  Stevia is also much sweeter than sugar, if that's why they chose Sucralose.  Sucralose is quite a bit sweeter than sugar, and I'm thinking they were looking for a way to have concentrated sweetness since the product is a concentrate and mixed with water.  Sucralose is about twice as sweet as stevia though, and stevia is 300 times as sweet as sugar.  So, maybe that isn't concentrated enough, or it would throw off the volume of the product.  I'd prefer to drink water instead of putting the artificial things in my body though.  My daughter, on the other hand, and her friends don't care as much about the artificial ingredients and have bought some more on their own.

Each person can custom tailor their own drinks.<br />I know it is labeled mango peach, but the peach bursts forth more than mango to me. It is still a refreshing touch when plain water needs  to be perked up. This isn't my favorite flavor of MIO, but it is still very good and I would highly recommend this product.<br />I like to use it at my job, we have well water there that has an aftertaste of sulfur. A light dash of this MIO in a cup, and the well water is instantly palatable. Well done MIO, please continue with these great flavors!

The thing I like best is that you can customize how much flavor by how much MIO you squirt in. With some lemonade mixes, I have to use two to get the flavor I want, no problem here, just squirt another shot in. The Peach is the dominate flavor over the Mango, but that is how I like it.

review/summary: Better than the tea!
review/text: I've come to the conclusion that I'm just not a big fan of these things... I'll definitely say that Mango Peach Mio was better than other flavors I've tried though! It tasted like a glass of juice, and the flavor wasn't half bad. I don't understand how it can recommend only a few drops though- for one, it takes about 20x that amount to actually get any flavor in the drink! For another, one of my biggest issues with these Mio things is that I can't get it to do a "drop". You squeeze it until it shoots out as a jet. I haven't managed to get it to just do a "drop". The peach flavor is a bit strong in comparison to the mango, and definitely is that artificial candy-type peach, not real peach flavor. All in all, I found this flavor drinkable, although it still wasn't as good as just buying some juice. It was still more drinkable than the "sweet tea" flavor, which was absolutely disgusting!

It definitely tastes like mango and peach, and has a nice, peachy color.  IMHO, it's a little too sweet, but if I flavor the water lightly, it's pretty good.  It uses sucralose for sweetening, and various other colors and flavors, so if you're sensitive, be careful.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend MIO Mango Peach, but definitely don't buy a four pack until you're sure it works for your taste.

review/text: While the idea of add as much as you like or as little as you like seems like a good idea, there is a chance that you will not get the recommended servings from ANY of the MIO products.  I usually 2 - 3 squirts in a 20oz water bottle to get a flavor that doesn't taste watered down.  The flavor of the product is great, but take caution when adding more as it tends to become bitter and not more intense.<br /><br />The price of these are somewhat expensive compared to the single serve powders out there on the market, which usually I do have an issue with the taste.  I personally can by Mio at the grocery store on sale cheaper.  If the price was to come down on these they would be a serious swap out for the powder water enhancers.

And here is a great use for it is when you are out backpacking and your filtered water doesn't taste all that great.

review/summary: Gives an Enjoyable Flavor to Your Boring Water
review/text: Peach Mango seems to be the flavor du jour these days and it is one of the better MIO flavors I have tried.  The product could not be easier to use, just a soft squeeze in your water and drink.  If you have taller cups, you may want to give the drink two quirts to keep it from the watered down flavor.  The bottle claims to make 24 servings, but I used Mio almost daily and it lasted about six weeks for me.  The only downside is the force of each squirts keeps the MIO liquid near the bottom requiring a little stirring to spread it equally in the water especially in larger cups.

review/summary: Mio Mango Peach Water flavor
review/text: I drink a lot of water and this is great.  In a liquid it mixes well, not like a powder that does not always mix well or creats a powder cloud.  Great taste and very convient to use.  My only complaint is that I can see using to much of it at one time, the more you add the more flavor, it's your choice.

review/summary: Pricey but delicious
review/text: I have purchased MIO products before in my local grocery store.  I've found that it is a trial and error process getting the right amount squeezed out. When I follow the directions, the taste is off.  Too much and blech.  Too little and there is no taste.  I found this blend easier to adjust then the tea blends.  This was actually my favorite.  It might be easier for new consumers to start with a large glass of water but only fill it part way.  That will leave room to add more water until you get the taste to your liking.  I haven't found that this particular blend has an aftertaste.  I think the teas do.<br /><br />I would recommend this.  Personally though, I only purchase it when it's deeply sale priced or on clearance. I know you get many uses from a 1.62 ounce container but it's not easy to anticipate the price per serving on this when the serving isn't as noted on the directions.  It's a mental thing.

review/text: I love the little MIO bottles, and I actually kinda dig the Mango Peach flavor.  I'm no mango nor peach connoisseur, and I'm partial to the generally sweet flavorings used here, so your mileage may very.  There is an aftertaste, but I never found it to be objectionable (compared to Crystal Light or similar).

review/text: The concept of this product is wonderful, since you can use as much or as little as you want.  I typically use the individual size packets of Crystal Light, which recommend using a standard sized bottle of water to mix it with.  With the MIO product, I can choose to make a smaller or larger amount.<br /><br />However, I really do not like the taste of this.  There is an odd tasting artificial peach flavor that I just do not like.

review/summary: Super Sweet Saccharine Taste
review/text: I wasn't sure what I expected from this product; I was imagining it would more like the flavoring when you add a lemon wedge to your water as compared with lemonade. If you are looking for a slight, subtle taste to add to your water, this is probably not it. The first time you try MIO, be careful that you aren't too heavy handed with your squeeze. Less is more, and too much MIO makes for an undrinkable beverage. Remember, you can always add more to taste. Removing the liquid is not as easy. :)<br /><br />I was curious to see what the liquid tasted like directly, but I attempted to squeeze a drop onto my finger. It's incredibly sweet, but beyond that, it is so saturated with artificial coloring that it not only stained my finger, but the countertop as well. I was able to get the color up with Windex, but water alone would not remove it.<br /><br />As to the taste, I enjoyed it as an occasional drink, but I don't think I would want to add it to every glass of water I enjoyed. I, however, mostly drink water. This may be a welcome change for someone who is more used to soda or other flavored drinks.

review/summary: Like the taste ... not the packaging
review/text: When I first received my MIO Mango Peach through the Amazon Vine program I was excited to try it. I am a huge fan of anything peach so I knew I would like the flavor. As expected the taste was really great added to a glass of water. What I didn't like was I found it very hard to squeeze the flavoring out of the bottle and to know how much I should squirt into the glass. The directions tell you how many teaspoons a serving is but if you try to squirt it into a spoon to measure it you just get a big mess. I wouldn't say this is a bad product but it's not something I will run out and purchase.

review/summary: taste is OK and it is sweet
review/text: This is a no calorie drink, I can't taste any mango but I do taste the peach, it is sweet and really doesn't taste bad. It says it has some natural flavors but along with that are a lot of artificial junk in it like Propylene Glycol, artificial sugars. I can't get the label off the ingredient list to be able to even see them all but this is definitely not a natural product. This is a great idea and I would love it if it were natural and healthy.. I feel like i am drinking a chemical concoction. I didn't have any real after taste but I couldn't drink the whole cup, the peach flavor gets kind of odd tasting after a couple of drinks. It is hard to explain the flavor, maybe it is the citric acid and the tartness?

review/summary: Nice concept if you want sweetened water with no calories.
review/text: Any way to get people to drink more water has to be a good thing.  Mio water enhancer adds flavor to your water so you are encouraged to drink more.  The bottle is small and would easily fit in a pocket or small purse.  Each bottle contains enough flavor for approximately 24 servings, but this varies based on how much you actually squeeze in.  There are zero calories as well.<br /><br />Overall, I would say it's a good product.  My wife and I both enjoyed the flavor.  The aftertaste of artificial sweetener is the only flaw.  The mango peach flavor is pretty good, but I actually prefer the sweet tea flavor.  We found ourselves using Mio while eating dinner and not wanting plain water.

review/summary: Concoct your own flavored water
review/text: Putting flavor on regular water really depends on one's preference.  I am curious and very intrigued with this new product that I tried the following three flavors: Peach-mango, sweet tea and peach tea.  Out of the three, I prefer sweet tea the best as it tastes closer to the real kind than peach tea and peach-mango.  Although I prefer water in its plain form, the taste is not far from ready-to-drink flavored water available commercially.  If you like those, it might worth to try as you more control in what flavor and much flavor you want to put in your water.<br /><br />Mio is very concentrated "water enhancer" - I never heard of those words until now.  A small bottle can be used 24 times.  The plastic bottle has a unique way of dispensing, it will not leak unless you squeeze the bottle for a squirt - one squirt, one serving, and one squirt is enough for a 6- to 8-ounce glass of water.  Of course you can squirt more depending how squirt happy you are. The amazing thing is that even if I don't stir it, just letting it stands for 20 seconds and the flavor spreads.<br /><br />It uses the artificial sweetener called Sucralose, whose scientific name is Splenda (OK, I probably have mixed them up).  Anyway, it is 600 times sweeter than sugar and has 0 calorie. Mio is also gluten-free.<br /><br />...it's still plain water for me.

review/summary: Surprisingly refreshing!
review/text: I was hesitant to try this as I am not a huge flavored water fan. I've tried several powdered mixes and they always seem too sugary/syrupy/sweet for me. The first time I tried this flavoring I added a few more drops than intended but I was actually very pleased with the result. It was extremely flavorful, but not too sweet or syrupy.  My three kids, ages 2, 4, and 7 all loved it too!. I love how you can easily change the strength of the flavor by adding a little less or a little more to your water. There's no need to have the exact bottled water size since you can dispense exactly the amount you want.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: great with great packaging
review/text: These are great drinks. I put 2 long squirts into 24oz with ice. The sweet tea is more sweet than tea, the peach is nice, and the mango-peach is very very nice. Keep in mind, those are my taste buds.<br /><br />They are liquid, and have a cap that is attached. The connection to the bottle seems a bit frail, but it has not come off.<br /><br />The package is sealed very well; however, one out of three bottles I got had leaked through the seal. I believe these must be boxed, because envelopes invite crushing.<br /><br />I really like these drinks. They last 2 months opened, no refrigeration; however, anything sweet goes in my fridge.<br /><br />What is also good about these drinks is that they have a little color, but not enough to stain my clothing, as my sippy cup leaks sometimes.<br /><br />Nice product; needs improvement.<br /><br />----<br />UPDATE:  The product bottle is more durable than I had anticipated.  These drinks have been my mainstay to stay hydrated throughout the day. I even dilute the product because I drink it all day.  Green Apple and Black Cherry from the store are wonderful too.  I am sold on these water flavorings.  Sweet Tea was my favorite from the batch I got from Amazon.

review/summary: Not really to my taste
review/text: I like to drink water with a little taste to it. So I often put a little orange juice in the glass before I pour in the water, diluting it about 20 to 1. That makes the water easier to drink.<br /><br />I thought this liquid might do the same thing. But it's not really to my taste. I could taste a flavor that I guess I would call mango peach. But it was not really a taste I wanted with my water.<br /><br />Also, the container says that you should use the whole bottle within a month of opening it. That will be hard to do. So this is not really a good choice for me.

review/summary: Sweet and sweet... no mango with a hint of peach for me
review/text: MIO is a great product.  No calories or caffeine, and easy to carry with you wherever you go to add a touch of flavor to water and assorted other items like yogurt, smoothies and protein shakes.  The trick is to find the flavors that work for you.  For me, Mango Peach didn't work.<br /><br />The problem?  Well, I just taste sweet - really sweet - and no real mango flavor, with a hint of peach coming through in the end. I think it's truly unfair to rate this item higher than a 3 out of 5 for me (means 'OK', but I don't like or love it...), but that's not to say it won't be fabulous for someone else.  Tastebuds are unique, and mine aren't wowed by this flavor.  I do like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUGW">MIO Berry Pomegranate, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4ADKU">MIO Fruit Punch, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4)</a> flavors.<br /><br />So before you buy a pack of 4 - pick up a single at your local store to give it a try.  You may find one you love out of the gate, or you may need to take your tastebuds for a drive around the block with a few flavors first.  Ultimately you'll find a flavor or two that suits you, and then you'll be hooked on the taste and convenience of this product.

review/text: My teenage daughter and my adult son both love MIO, but most of the flavors taste a bit off to me. Out of the flavors that I've tried, this is the one I like best. It's a strong fruity flavor with less chemical aftertaste then the other flavors.<br /><br />It's caffeine free and sugar free, which makes it a good option for people who dislike plain water. It adds sweetness and flavor. The size of the bottle makes it easy to carry, and the fact it's so concentrated means it can be added easily to bottled waters.<br /><br />I'll stick to drinking herbal tea for the most part for flavor and hydration, but I do appreciate the convenience this offers and the flexibility of determining how much flavor and sweetness you want.

With only a few drops, you can disguise your water with the subtle taste of mango and peach, add a few more drops, and you can strengthen the flavor. I carry it with me to use when I'm eating out or for an afternoon pick-me-up. I also add it to my water bottle.

review/summary: Tea for 24
review/text: Sometimes, you think, plain water is boring--especially when you know that you need to drink several glasses of it every day.  Having a product that gives a pleasant taste to water seems like a great idea.  Somewhere between the execution of that great idea and the actual Mio product, is reality.<br /><br />We all perceive tastes and smells differently, having thousands of receptors in our mouths, noses, and on our tongues.  Our enjoyment or dislike of a product varies, based on those receptors.  Remember too, that we `eat with our eyes' before we taste anything.<br /><br />Using � teaspoon of the concentrate in eight ounces of water (very cold with ice), here are my impressions of this water enhancer:<br />Eyes:  it looks light, orangey-brown.  It's the way one would expect a tea-based drink to appear when fruits with orangey flesh are mixed in it<br /><br />Nose:  there's a pleasant flowery aroma of peaches.  If mango is present, it is overwhelmed (for me) by the peach scent.<br /><br />Mouth:  the first sensation is sweetness, not at all cloying.  Next, is the taste of peach with something else.  It doesn't make me think of mango but, some mangoes are delicately flavored.  The third sensation comes after swallowing.  It tastes artificial.  After a few more sips, I'm a bit disappointed.  If the artificiality were eliminated, I'd like this product very much.<br /><br />The container is small enough to slip into a handbag, briefcase or, backpack.  The directions call for a half-teaspoon measurement.  It would be easier to have the liquid dispense in drops that could be squeezed from the bottle so, instead of guessing as to exact measurement, the number of drops would be more precise.<br /><br />If used according to the package's directions, this little vial contains 24 servings.  It's certainly convenient to be able to turn a glass of water--or a bottle--into a tasty beverage.  Amazon offers a four-pack (and a single vial option).  Together, they make 96 flavored glasses of water.  That's a tremendous savings if you were to buy the equivalent in bottles of flavored water.<br /><br />Please note that this product contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.  It also contains dyes.<br /><br />Since we rely on our own senses to rate taste, you may want to buy the single container and judge it for yourself.

review/summary: Can't taste the mango.
review/text: I drink primarily water.  Occasionally, I like a little flavor.  I do not like caffeine and prefer no calories.  Nothing on the bottle says no caffeine, but the product description I read says there is none.  The instructions say to use one squeeze per 8 oz.  I used 2 in about 22 oz.  The color is an orangy-brown.  The smell is faint and so are the flavors.  I hesitate to use more because it is already sweeter than I prefer.  The peach taste is light and pretty artificial tasting.  I detect no mango.<br /><br />I also received the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4)</a>.  I made a bit of a mess the first time I used it because I was afraid it would all dump out if I turned it upside down over my glass.  When I squeezed it, it went everywhere.  It does not dump out when you turn it upside down.  It stays in until you squeeze it.  The packaging works better than then what's inside.

review/summary: Love the flavor & easy to use
review/text: So easy to use! You just get a glass of water, or a bottle of water if you're on the go, squirt in your desired amount of MIO and your water is transformed into sweet tea! That easy! You can adjust the amount of flavor you want by adding more MIO to your water for a stronger flavor, I have found that I need one squirt and about � of another squirt for my tall Coke glasses that I have at home. If you're like me water can be a very boring drink to drink but you really don't want to drink high fructose corn syrup so for me MIO is a great way to make water more enjoyable.<br /><br />The amount of times I can use 1 container (about 25-28 depends on how many squirts you use) makes MIO an affordable substitution to some other brands. I am very thrilled with MIO and would recommend giving it a try. Plus now that I have tried two flavors , that I have both enjoyed, it just makes we want to try more so that every time I drink water I can have a different type of MIO.<br /><br />Mango Peach is a sweet flavor that is just perfect for me! Love the mango and peach and it is such a perfect combination. One flavor does not over power the other flavors. This being the 4th flavor of MIO that I have tried, I have to say that Mango Peach is my favorite!

review/summary: Peach Jolly Rancher in liquid form
review/text: MIO Liquid Water Enhancer tastes like a peach Jolly Rancher to me, no mango.  Same as a peach Jolly Rancher, I like the flavor despite the slight artificial taste and aftertaste.  It is fun to watch the peach color spread quickly through the water without stirring.<br /><br />However, a few minutes after drinking a couple of glasses, I developed a sore throat with a burning sensation that caused me to keep swallowing for about twenty minutes so I won't be using it again and can't recommend it to others.<br /><br />The MIO packaging is novel.  It really puts out a forceful little squirt when you squeeze it so I recommend trying it out in the kitchen sink the first time.  Although it didn't stain my countertop, it did stain a white cotton dishtowel a pink tone.  The bottle seems quite leak-proof so I think it would be safe to carry in your purse or backpack, although I would probably keep it in a sandwich bag just in case.<br /><br />Ingredients:  water, malic acid, propylene glycol, citric acid, contains less than 2% of natural flavor, sucralose and acesulfame potassium (sweeteners), potassium citrate, polysorbate 60, yellow 5, yellow 6, red 40, potassium sorbate (preservative).

A somewhat pleasant bitter-sweet, vaguely hinting at Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e or maybe just burned sugar. Strange, not unlike the plain Peach flavor I sampled the other day. I finished the glass and the good news is that 24 hours later there were no side effects other than some mild aftertaste that slowly faded away and changed into more bitter and less sweet. The even better news is that the MiO does not seem to be addictive but time will tell.<br /><br />My review sample had a sticky label over the contents disclosure but patience goes a long way. This is what I learned after I removed the sticky: this product contains mostly... nothing worth talking about. 0 calories, 0% fat, 0% sodium, 0% carbs, 0% protein. It has no or only trace amounts of cholesterol, fiber, saturated fat, transfats, Vitamin C, Calcium or Iron.<br /><br />Then... what is this tea made of? Not of peaches or mangoes for sure. According to the ingredients list, the main ingredient besides 'water' is Propylene Glycol. It's worth checking it out on the Wiki because it's a very useful chemical. They have a long list of good uses there including as a: solvent used in mixing photographic chemicals, working fluid in hydraulic presses, the main ingredient in deodorant sticks, the killing and preserving agent in pitfall traps and to capture ground beetles, cooling agent for beer and wine glycol jacketed fermentation tanks and so many other useful activities such as to regulate humidity in a cigar humidor.<br /><br />All of this is great because, like I said, one day later I'm still okay and smell like a rose or... Cr&egrave;me Br�l&eacute;e? - the deodorant effect - but... where's the tea? I am going to grant this product 2 stars because, after I consumed it in moderation (one glass) it did not make me sick. I'm not planning to drink any more but I'm thinking about using it as bait for Japanese Beetles this coming summer.

review/summary: Yummy... but still fake.
review/text: I put one decent squirt of my mango peach Mio in a glass of about 6oz of water. The flavor saturation was excellent! It has a nice little tart zing to it, although it's very sweet, sweeter than i really like. I think in the future I will use this in iced tea to help counter act the heavy sweetness. The flavor is good, but it still has that twinge of chemical flavoring. But of course, it IS made from chemicals, so what do i expect, right? Overall it's a good product that is fun and easy to use, and tastes pretty good.

review/summary: Tastes okay . . . for a glassful of chemicals
review/text: The taste of MIO Mango Peach is okay on my palette.  Fruity and sweet, it does a good job of masking the 'taste' of water (even tap water).  I won't say I am overly fond of it, because I prefer to just have plain water or water with lemon, but the idea behind the product is a good one.<br /><br />Its small size is convenient for a purse or pocket, making it handy to take along to work, or out to lunch, or anywhere on the go.  Being liquid, there is no powder to dissolve -- just squeeze and stir slightly.  You can squeeze a little or a lot, depending on your taste buds.  I found one squeeze in a glass of water was a little too watered down, so I added a little more for a peachier flavor.  Since nothing is pre-measured, I like this feature a lot.  It also has zero calories, zero carbs, zero sugar, so it's a perfect for guilt-free soda replacement.<br /><br />However, I give MIO Mango Peach an average 3-star review because basically it transforms your glass of water into a glass of chemicals.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing; it's just not *my* thing.  Of note, one of the ingredients is Propylene Glycol, which although is said to be safe for human and animal consumption, after reading what else it's used for (Google it), it really doesn't make me want to drink any more.  MIO Mango Peach contains less than 2% of natural flavors.  It contains dyes (Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40) for a 'peach' colored tint, which I think is unnecessary.  Why not just clear?<br /><br />I realize that our food and drink is already full of chemicals and we ingest these freely every day, but I'm just not sure *I* want to be adding more to my water.  You can judge for yourself.  3/5 average stars.

review/summary: Well-designed container, OK nondescript flavor, not too keen about the ingredients
review/text: The MiO Mango Peach Liquid Water Enhancer comes in 1.62 ounce cute-looking, small containers well-suited for portable use if you want to bring one or more of them along during an outing.  Each container is designed for ease of use -- flip the protective cap up, tip the container, then squeeze to let the MiO liquid come out.<br /><br />You do need to get an initial feel for how much of the MiO liquid to add to your water.  The suggested "recipe" is one squeeze per 8 fl ounce serving.  After some initial experimentations, I found this suggested recipe to be just right for me, and in my particular case, although I didn't detect an aftertaste, the sweet flavor I tasted didn't really taste like mango peach.<br /><br />I'm personally not too keen about this product's ingredients which, among other things, include propylene glycol, sucralose and acesulfame potassium (sweeteners) and various dyes for artificial colorings.  Although I understand these ingredients are used in many other products, I'll be quite happy with just adding a few drops of lemon or lime into my cold glass of water if I have a desire to give it some taste.

review/summary: Tastes OK, but leaves a strange feeling in back of throat
review/text: Kraft totally missed with some of their other flavors, but this one is actually pretty good. It looks like Robutussin, but tastes like comparable artificially flavored zero-calorie peach and mango drinks on the market. The artificial sweeteners (sucralose and acesulfame) left a strange tickling feeling in the back of my throat however, and I'm concerned about all the chemical additives in here. There's no actual peach, mango, or tea extract in here, but instead an unhealthy mix of preservatives (propylene glycol, potassium sorbate) and dyes (yellow 5, yellow 6, red 40). The flavor is derived from something mysteriously labeled as only "natural flavor" (2%).<br /><br />Proplyene glycol is a widely-used industrial chemical, used to make everything from anti-freeze to soap to solvents. It's odorless and flavorless, but what's it doing in a food product?<br /><br />Lastly, Kraft used type 7 plastic in this product instead of the universally recyclable type 1 (PETE) and 2 (HDPE). Only type 1 and 2 plastics can be recycled in my city.

review/summary: Careful when opening!  Mixed reviews from family on taste, certainly can be useful.
review/text: If you live at high altitude, be careful when you first open this.  It squirts out on it's own, and the coloring is very intense and not fun to clean up.  It came off pretty easily from the table, but the cloth used to wipe it up had to go through the wash twice to remove the coloring. This is an issue if you are giving this to kids to use.<br />In Europe they make "koolaid" with concentrated sugar solutions.  I always thought that was a great idea, as you can control the amount of sweetness.  This is an artificial sweetener version of the same idea. It gives a sweet, light taste to the water.  I liked the taste, my husband found it cloying, my 12 year old daughter loves it and my 15 year old son says it is "ok".<br /><br />Uses:<br />Masking iodine taste in water:<br /> I also tried it in iodine sterilized water. It does help mask that nasty aftertaste.  I will get a different flavor for him (peach is not his thing) to bring on camping trips to mask the flavor of iodine.  I will be happy to do that, because he hates the taste of the iodine so much that I worry he will become dehydrated on these trips.  Its small enough to not add too much weight to his backpack.<br /><br />Diabetics (or dieters):<br />This is great for those who need to watch sugar intake and who will not drink plain water.  Plain water would certainly be healthier, but if that is not an option, this will help.<br /><br />Convenience:<br /> I used to bring koolaid one packs (the kind that flavor one bottle of water) into amusement parks etc so that the kids could have something besides water to drink (no soda allowed because of braces).  This adds another option.<br /><br />Consider the ingredients if you are concerned about artificial sweeteners, but this is a nice option to plain water and certainly a better option than soda.

review/summary: I prefer water to sweet non-descript flavoring
review/text: I'm glad that I received only a single container of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4CCSQ">MIO Liquid Peach Tea, 1.62-Ounce, (Pack of 4)</a> because it's not my "cup of tea."  Adding a few drops to water, one instantly has an artificially sweetened and flavored product which on the positive side can make fans drink more water.  Because it has virtually no nutritional value, it's simply an enhancer to water, which we all should be drinking.  I tried this in a variety of concentrations and found it to be the most palatable in a glass of seltzer, using about half of the recommended dosage.  It dilutes quicker than powdered products like crystal light, and because it's in a resealable small bottle, storage is better.  I'd prefer it not be colored, but I'm sure the market researches determined that customrs needed to see that their water was flavored in addition to tasting it.  I'm curious to know if this is usable in the prep which is used for GI procedures like the colonoscopy, where crystal light is recommended for flavoring.  In that application, I think it would be great and would suggest that it be recommended.  Because I prefer this to other instant water enhancers, I'm giving the product 4 stars.

review/summary: Not my Favorite Mio Flavor, but still Yummy!
review/text: I have been addicted to Mio since it came out. I can no longer have sugar due to health issues and Mio makes it a lot easier for me to drink water. I love that it is so portable and you can mix it in ANY amount of liquid (whether you have 4oz of water or a gallon) and in any container (bottles, cups, gallon jugs, etc.). You can also decide how much to add. If you like it strong and sweet, just add more Mio. If you want your flavor faint, then add only a tiny bit. It is easy, delicious and it doesn't have carbs or sugar. The only bad thing I can say about Mio is that there is a lot of coloring and it can stain your clothes or desk. I agree with some other reviewers that I wish it had less coloring.<br /><br />Regarding this flavor: I am not a huge fan of peach, but I like mango and wanted to try all of the Mio flavors. I was pleasantly surprised that the peach flavor was not overpowering. You can taste both mango and peach, but they are in perfect harmony with each other. While this is not my favorite flavor, it is pretty good. If you are a huge peach fan then you will probably love it. I like this enough to finish the bottle off, but I probably will not buy it again. I am going to stick with my favorite flavors (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQGO">MIO Orange Tangerine, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4FUGW">MIO Berry Pomegranate, 1.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOQKA">MIO Black Cherry, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>).

review/summary: Awesome
review/text: This stuff tastes great.  It's my favorite flavor of the three I tried.<br /><br />The sucralose (slenda) and acesulfame k sweeteners do a good job with the fruity flavoring.  Compared to diet coke or any number of artificially sweetened beverages, I think this is the best I've ever tried.  I did not have any problem with aftertaste, which has bothered me with other drinks.<br /><br />The bottle itself (egg sized, btw) is well designed and hard to accidentally dispense.  It couldn't be easier to mix a drink with this.  I fill the glass halfway with water, give it a squirt, and then finish filling the glass.  It mixes so much more easily than powder.  It also leaves no powdery residue, making this much more convenient for cleaning (such as with bottles or canteens).  It also masks flavors quite effectively, such as if you're camping and have purified some water with charcoal.<br /><br />These little suckers are a bargain compared to other beverages, and probably healthier than most alternatives, too.

review/summary: Sweet, but the taste and artificial ingredients are off putting
review/text: Kraft's MIO Mango Peach came in a small, sleek, palm-sized silver bottle that is easy to slip inside your purse and use a a quick-pick me up to sweeten a glass of water.<br /><br />I followed the tongue-in-cheek directions on the side of the bottle, and was surprised it did what it said. One squeeze of the bright-orange liquid into an 8 oz drink yielded a low-calorie, sweet-tasting drink (sans the vitamin content) comparable many sports drinks sold in stores.<br /><br />And like many of these drinks, MIO unfortunately has the same ingredients propylene glycol(look it up online,) sucralose and dyes. Being a peach and a mango lover, this drink didn't taste like either fruit.<br /><br />If you don't like drinking plain water, and need a sweetener, then this may be an option for you. I wish, however, that Kraft would revamp this product with a healthier, less artificial version for consumers.

review/summary: A quick way to add a little flavor to your drinking water
review/text: The cute little bottles of MIO contain enough flavoring for about 24 8-oz. glasses of water according to the advertising.  The lid on the container stays snapped tight enough when closed that you could easily carry it along in your purse or your backpack or your briefcase and perhaps in your back pocket if you wear baggy pants.  The product squirts out of the top rather than coming out in drops.  (I learned out the hard way and shot a bright orange stream of the stuff across the counter top on my first try).  The way it's made it propels the liquid into your drink so you don't have to shake it much to blend.  The only one I've tried so far is the Mango Peach and I liked the taste.  I used 5 squirts in  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006P4BR3E">Contigo AUTOSPOUT� Addison 24 oz. Water Bottles 3 pack Blue, Charcoal, Honeysuckle</a> and that gave me a moderate mango-peachy drink that didn't taste overwhelmingly sweet.  I'm not sure how they measure a "squeeze" since it seems like if you gave it a long squeeze it would release more of the product.  My squeezes were short and light so maybe that amounts to half a real squeeze?<br /><br />The ingredient list reads like this: Water, Malic Acid, Propylene Glycol, Citrict Acid, Contains less than 2% of natural flavor, Sucralose and Acesulfame potassium (Sweeteners), Potassium citrate, Polysorbate 60, Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, Potassium Sorbate (Perservative). Sucralose is the sweetener in Splenda which in my opinion is one of the better tasting artificial sweeteners out there.  At the level I used it, I didn't notice any aftertaste.  I'm not crazy about the artificial colors and I'd prefer that they weren't there, but visual appeal is important in marketing a product and I can understand why it's there.<br /><br />The advantage MIO has over the little powdered water flavoring packets is that it's liquid and therefore it dissolves more quickly and completely.  When I used the packets I never use the whole thing because it makes the drink too sweet, so I end up with partial packets left over that are easy to spill if you don't seal them well.  MIO lets you use just what you need which I like.  I could see this as a flavoring for yogurt or maybe even ice cream.

review/summary: It's Ok
review/text: I love flavored water, so I thought I'd give this a try.  It's a really neat idea and the bottle is small enough to fit in your pocket, a small purse, or your car console.  It has zero calories, sugar, etc., so it is a diet drink and tastes like it no matter how much or little you use.  The one thing I really don't like about it is that it does not drip out in small drops, you squeeze it and the least that you can squeeze out is about a full tablespoon, which means your water really can't ever taste like water with a touch of peach mango juice, it tastes like watered down peach mango juice.  I was hoping you could do smaller drops to get more of a light flavored water taste, but it doesn't work that way.

review/summary: Artificial Ingredients and horrible after taste- not a winning combination
review/text: I really enjoy naturally flavored spring water so I was excited to review this "water enhancer" for Amazon Vine.  The first thing that discouraged me was the list of really unhealthy ingredients. I wish the ingredients would have been listed in the product description.  I would have skipped this offer if I would have known it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose and Polysorbate 60. Polysorbate 60 is used in cosmetics and shampoos so I'm wasn't too crazy about the idea of consuming it. However, since I had agreed to review the product I went ahead and squirted one shot into an 8 oz cup of water.  It tasted like a cup of watered down kool-aid.  The taste wasn't horrible, but the after taste was unpleasant.  I added a second squirt and ended up with a cup of water that tasted like a mouthful of sugar followed by a bad after taste.  My kids also tried it and hated it.  Their exact words? "That's disgusting"  I think we will stick to naturally flavored sparkling water.

review/text: MIO comes in a tiny little bottle for all the flavor it has.  This liquid is concentrated.  Just a little squeeze into water and we get flavored water, just like the stuff we buy in the store.  A bigger squeeze and it's more like punch.  Don't add too much or it starts tasting very syrupy.  I carry this bottle with me in my purse.  When I go somewhere where sodas are expensive (that's my vice) and water is readily available, I take the water and add MIO to it.  It's a great alternative when I want something with flavor.

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I had this first in Las Vegas, when I went for a trip.  I was so thirsty from walking around in the hot desert. When I went to a restaurant, Bouchon, they didn't have any lemonade. So, the waiter offered me this stuff... I wasn't sure at first. I thought it was a trick to get me to pay more money for something that is the equivalent of squeezed lemon in water with some sugar. BUT IT WAS SO GOOD. I had limonada everyday when I was in Vegas, everywhere that they offered it. I would demand to have a bottle of the good stuff.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I came back to my natural habitat on the East Coast. I did not find any Limonada anywhere. When I tried to google for it, even that masterful search engine found nothing. Fast forward a couple months later, I go to a charity event. They offer as a giveaway to the people who attended drinks, sponsored by SAN PELLAGRINO. &lt;3  Heart be still!!!  It was my beloved Limonada in the US. In the north! Say what???<br /><br />Hoping that maybe limonada had somehow made its way to my cold region, I decided to try again my search. I looked online. BEHOLD Amazon, this retailer sells it in 6 packs! In the glass bottle! Straight from the bubbling springs of Italy. I purchased some right away. In didn't care if shipping was about double the price of the product. A few days later, these wonderful bottles made it's way to my refrigerator.<br /><br />I've been enjoying one a day. This supplier seems to have the best price so far of all the places I've looked. You can get a larger quantity for cheaper price per bottle. One retailer is selling it for $48 for free shipping for like a case with 48. However, if you want to try it out first, you might want to go with this listing. Currently, the price is $15 (including shipping & handling for 6 bottles). Not a bad deal for the most delicious bubbly lemonade in the world.

The balance of lemon, sparkle and zest takes this drink to the level of a gourmet beverage, which requires no mixing. I may have tasted this before, but recently ordered it while eating out at a Restaurant.<br /><br />San Pellegrino is also made with mineral water found near the town of San Pellegrino Terme which is located 70 kilometers northeast of Milan. The water flows from a thermal spring at the foot of a Dolomite mountain wall. The use of this water definitely adds to the energy this drink seems to possess.<br /><br />The carbonation seems more sophisticated and delicate. The only way to describe it is to say these waters are the champagne of sparkling waters.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Delicious, expensive
review/text: This stuff is the most delicious beverage out there - but it's difficult to find in a 6-pack of bottles so I ordered it from Amazon. That's quite an expensive way to go, but boy was it worth it!

review/summary: Good deal
review/text: I can only assume they product has the vitamins and minerals listed.  My young shair pei gobbles them up.  The 3 year old won't eat them unless they are in her food but she is a fussy eater anyway.

review/text: The best non-dairy "milk" I've found so far. The shipping price is deadly due to the weight. I can't find this at my local health food store. And I do want to find more of it. Excellent combination, the almond milk and the coconut milk seem to complement one another. Very tasty!

review/text: It is a great tasting product.  My favorite.  Too bad, you are able to buy each for about one dollar in Costa Rica.  Out of my budget.

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: I was very disappointed with this item. Although it arrived before the 'best by' date on carton, the fortune cookies were very stale. This was the first time I had bought food from this site and it will be the last.

review/summary: Not as described fortune cookies
review/text: These are not as described which did not make me happy.  They are NOT individually wrapped.  They are wrapped together in a bag inside the box.  I am the only one that eats them.  Therefore they will probably go bad before I eat the box which means I wasted money....Not really happy about that.  Tastewise they are ok...

review/summary: Good, but some stale cookies..
review/text: I ordered a dozen of these boxes early May of 2012. Cookies were individually packaged and packed box consistently of 12, but I still received a number of stale cookies. The "best by" date for all the cookies are July 8 2012. These leaves me with only two months left. I would expect at least a few more than two months on these.<br /><br />The cookies are tasty, but as good as Panda Express's. I would buy again, but they really need to send fresher cookies.<br /><br />5-31-12 update, ranked down from 4-> 2 stars. I'm getting a lot more stale and crashed cookies.

review/summary: Not what I ordered
review/text: When the box arrived, I was excited to open it and enjoy the cookies.  However, the box didn't contain "La Choy" branded cookies as I had ordered.  Instead, it contained "Golden Bowl" branded fortune cookies.  A Great many of which were broken/smashed in some fashion.  I did try the cookies that arrived and I did not like their taste.  Needless to say, I'm very disappointed in the vendor who shipped me this order.
