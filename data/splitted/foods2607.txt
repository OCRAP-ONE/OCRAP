review/summary: experation date
review/text: I was disappointed with the experation date on this product.  Buying 24 of something is taking a chance as it is but when you get them and then have to use it all in a couple of months that is a negative.  As for the product, not bad for the price but I probably wouldn't buy it again.  I will stick with what I can get at the grocery store.

review/summary: Iced mochas for me, chocolate milk for the kids - we all win!
review/text: We bought this with a coupon at our warehouse grocery store wondering if we'd ever use it all, but here we are on our second canister now! Let me tell you, this stuff is very versatile! I know Nestle just advertises it as a chocolate milk drink mix, but we've found many uses for it.<br /><br />I use it with milk to make hot cocoas (and it's become my preference over Swiss Miss packets and the like), we've used it to add chocolaty flavors to baking projects, we obviously make our toddler the occasional chocolate milk for a treat, but my favorite thing to do with Nesquik powder is to make myself an iced mocha! (Although you could certainly make hot mochas as well). My husband has recently been on my case for spending almost $5 every day (sometimes twice) on Starbuck's iced mochas. I have a newborn, you see, so I'm sleep deprived and my coffee consumption has gone up. I'm addicted! But we realized the Starbuck's charges were adding up quite a bit, so as an alternative, most days I turn to Nesquik instead. It doesn't taste like Starbuck's mochas, but it does make for a tasty coffee drink if you like them chocolaty. I use one shot of espresso (or strong coffee if I'm away from our espresso machine), two spoonfuls of Nesquik, and fill the glass up the rest of the way with about 1 cup of milk. It's yummy! You can add ice, or keep it hot if you like. In the long run, we've saved money for sure by using the Nesquik.<br /><br />Finally, I have to say that as a mom, the ingredient list is satisfactory. This obviously isn't what you'd call health food, and certainly not advertised as organic or anything - but as far as the ingredient list goes it's pretty mild. No scary sounding ingredients I can't pronounce on the label - mostly minerals, vitamins, and sugar. There are no artificial sweeteners, as advertised. I absolutely expect us to remain regular buyers of Nesquik, it fits in nicely with my family!

review/summary: Son likes it.
review/text: My son loves Nesquik chocolate drink mix.  It may have sugar, but at least it's less sugary than it used to be and I can control the amount we mix in.  He gets the protein and calcium from the milk, which he really needs.  Better than soda, which would be all empty calories.  One big can lasts a long time.  I'm glad it keeps well on the shelf.

review/summary: Nesquik Syrup is Better
review/text: Don't get me wrong, Nesquik powder tastes great and all. However, if you are trying to avoid soy products, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029JXN9K">Nestle Nesquik Syrup, Chocolate, 22-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> would be a better alternative which contains no soy. If you do choose the powder, it seems like the granules are more of a hassle to mix with milk than the syrup which is already a thin liquid. I use chocolate milk as a recovery drink after running because it has a thee to one ratio of carbs to protein--just what a worked out body is craving. Mixing my own saves some money and I get to control what kind of ingredients go into it.

But the price went way up so I tried ordering Chicken of the Sea on a subscription. Big disappointment! As soon as I opened the cans I could see that the color was "off" and the smell was stale and tinny. I could hardly smell clams at all. The taste was just as disappointing. I have cancelled my subscription.

review/summary: Delicious brittle - -  packaging needs work
review/text: I love the brittle I get from Swiss Maid. It is delicious, crunchy and made with what are obviously high quality ingredients. The cashew crunch is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. I wish they did the same thing with almonds and/or peanuts or really any of the other nuts. I'm down in Texas so the time to receive my order seemed to be absurdly long. Though, I will admit, it is well worth the wait. I also would like to see Swiss Maid use a different type of packaging for their product. The "brittle" bags are so "brittle" they tend to "crack" open in the box. Even if they do not "crack" in the shipping process, they are not durable enough to store the product. This is peripheral detail that really needs a little work, but it is not going to prevent me form ordering more.

review/summary: Low glycemic alternate sweetener
review/text: Wholesome Sweeteners' organic raw agave is a natural sweetner extracted from the heart of the agave plant. It is produced at a low temperature and has a full sweet flavor with subtle molasses tones. Agave is a low glycemic index (GI) sweetner, so it is slowly absorbed into the body preventing spikes in blood sugar. It is 25% sweeter than sugar, so you need less. Use wherever you would use sugar.<br /><br />Except in my coffee. I don't like the taste of it in coffee. I LOVE the taste of it in cereal and oatmeal, etc.

review/text: I primarily use agave in my coffee and tea, but it's also great when you need to add some sweetener to a smoothie.  You don't need much, as it is very sweet!  The taste is similar to maple syrup, but not quite as strong.  I guess you could say it's an in-between of maple syrup and corn syrup.  VERY delicious and great for those on sugar-free diets or who are diabetic.  Stop using those chemical sweetners and switch to Agave!!!

review/summary: A Wonderful, Low-Glycemic Sweetener
review/text: I'm always looking out for alternatives to sugar and the popular but somewhat dangerous artificial sweeteners.  My mother recommended this to me and it's fabulous.  When you get some just pour a little on your finger and taste it.  It's a very smooth and pleasant sweetness.  It may vaguely resemble the flavor of honey but it's pretty much a normal sweet flavor.<br /><br />Ah, there's so many good things about agave nectar!<br />* Low-glycemic index<br />* Low-calorie<br />* Easily mixes with hot or cold<br />* Doesn't crystallize like honey<br />* 25% sweeter than sugar<br />* Little if any aftertaste<br />* Natural, usually organic<br />* Doesn't require refrigeration<br /><br />I've tried this brand and one other and I haven't been disappointed with either.  This stuff may not be as cheap as sugar or other artificial sweeteners but it's still very cheap, it's very safe, and I believe the health benefits are well worth it.<br /><br />Check your local grocery stores to see if they have any (before you buy larger amounts online).  I was amazed my grocery store had several brands right next to the sugar!

review/summary: Lowest price for a high quality sweetener!
review/text: We normally use fruit to sweeten, but for things like vegan pancakes, french toast, and certain baked goods this is a great sweetener to replace Maple Syrup and sugar.  It has a mild taste, and according to the company it is a "low glycemic index sweetener, so it is slowly absorbed into the body preventing spikes in blood sugar."  They don't show the fiber content on the nutrition facts label.  That information would convince me that this statement is true.  In any case, it's a great price on Amazon, lower than any wholesaler offer I've seen.

review/text: This is an excellent price on a fantasic product. And you can even get it on Auto-ship. I don't understand why anyone would use an artificial sweetner like aspertame when this is available for this price. I enjoy the flavor, it's naturally sweet, so I don't get that chemical flavor that diet sodas have. I use it in club soda with a squeeze of lime to make a natural spritzer that is delicious and tastes just like lemon-lime soda.<br /><br />Between the Blue Agave nectar and my stevia packets, I've got all my sweet cravings covered.<br /><br />This is a 44 ounce bottle, plus it's a two-pack. I reccomend this to anyone looking to a good low-glycemic alternative to sugar at a reasonable price.

It's tough to find this size on the store shelves and if you use this for baking, it will definitely come in handy. I use agave to replace granulated sugar in most of my recipes.  If you're vegan and enjoy baking as I do, agave is awesome.  It's been such a blessing for my diabetic father too, being that it's low glycemic. If you haven't tried it, you really must!

review/summary: REALLY GREAT SUGAR ALTERNATIVE FOR DIABETICS
review/text: THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE PRODUCT.  NO STRANGE AFTERTASTE OR CHEMICALS IN YOUR BODY, AND IT'S LOW GLYCEMIC AND APPROPRIATE FOR DIABETICS.  I'M NOT DIABETIC BUT IT'S NICE TO KNOW THIS DOESN'T CAUSE ANY INSULIN SPIKES.  WHO NEEDS THOSE?  GOOD STUFF.  44 OZ ON AUTO SHIP IS CHEAPER BY FAR THAN BUYING IT AT WHOLE FOODS, A DIFFERENT (I THINK BETTER) BRAND - GET SOME YUM

review/summary: OG Raw Blue Agave ROCKS!
review/text: I would not hesitate to recommend this product, particularly if you are looking for a vegan sweetener.  It  does not have to be refrigerated, does not thicken or get hard like honey does, and it is a LOW glycemic food.  Just google those three word and you will get an eyeful.  One of our new faves is agave lemonade:  squeeze about 4 to 6 lemons to get 1 cup juice, add 2/3 cup agave and shake it all up in a one GALLON jug.  Fill to the brim and enjoy!  My brother swears it is the best adjunct he's had for his morning oatmeal.  We also add a smidge to sweeten our simple one part vinegar, two parts olive oil dressing.<br /><br />BTW, you can't beat Amazon's price.  OG honey, OG maple syrup, OG brown rice syrup and even barley malt have all skyrocketed in cost.  We raised our family on local clove honey in the 80's and 90's, back when it or barley malt in a five gallon tub ran sixty cents a pound...  No MORE!  Bee blight and agricultural over spraying - and certainly climate change - have drastically reduced honey production, thus the prices have gone up as would be expected.  But if you think this is expensive, go stand in your co-op's or natural grocer's aisle and price the 11 ounce bottle.  You will be impressed!

review/summary: Just chemically manufactured fructose
review/text: I hate that I bought this before researching it, now I feel ripped off. Agave is nothing more than chemically man-made fructose which is stored as fat in the body and also makes a person's arteries hard. Table sugar is a healthier and excellent substitute for agave. This product is as natural and as healthy as corn syrup, it's a marketing scam. It should be called hydrolyzed inulin syrup.

review/summary: Please research before you purchase!
review/text: I bought and used this "raw syrup" only to find out isn't raw, natural, or a syrup. This is not like honey or maple syrup. It is processed and is a high fructose syrup. The only real difference between agave and high fructose corn syrup is the corn. Now, if that is what you are looking for this is the product for you. Granted, Agave is suppose to be organic; so it probably doesn't have chemicals and is non-GM however in my opinion this is not a health food. It is heavily refined. Do some research before you buy.

review/summary: Organic Blue Agave Nectar
review/text: I loved the taste of the Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar. It had just the right amount of sweetness. The problem is that it is also very high in sugar. 16g of sugar per tablespoon, which add up to 60 calories a serving, is pretty high.I would have given it 5 stars if not for the high sugar content.I am trying to lose weight, and I gained using the Organic Raw Blue Agave Nectar. So I had to go back to using Truvia sweetner for my coffee, tea, etc.<br /><br />If I had not been trying to lose weight, I would still be using it. It taste great and is a very wholesome sweetner, and better for you than refined sugar.

review/text: Why should I review a product that Amazon has stopped selling??? It was good and inexpensive. But what can be done now? I looked on E-BAY and found 2 44oz bottles for $202. Are they KIDDING?!?! Of course there were others for $68 but there was one seller for $35 for 2 bottles plus $12.99 shipping and handling. Even the 10 bottles that Amazon had left were $28 for 2. I guess that WHOLESOME Sweetners was just getting very expensive, because my last auto shipment was just $16 for the 2 bottles then Amazon cancelled my auto subscription. So, even though it is a good product I don't recommend buying it at any price more that $10 per 44 oz bottle.<br /><br />wbrewsr

review/text: About a year ago while riding in a car group the subject of sugar substitues came up.  One lady mentioned she had just gone online and ordered Agave sweetner and preceded to relate all the health benefits of it, as well as the fact that the price was right. Even better she loved the taste, and that it could be used in all your beverages, cereals and for cooking a variety of dishes.  As soon as I arrived home I went online, straight to Amazon.com and just as she had said the price was right.  I immediately ordered it and have been hooked every since, because it is the most excellent sweetner I have ever tried. Barb

review/summary: Too Good To Be True: Contains MORE FRUCTOSE THAN HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP
review/text: I enjoyed this product for a whole two days, at the end of the day I thought "hmmmmm...this is good...too good...time to investigate with google". What this led me to was a whole lot of information indicating that this product is REALLY REALLY BAD. One of the most striking points is that it has more fructose than corn syrup, can you believe that? They market this EXTREMELY well by making you think that you are getting the sugar from its orginal source without any interference, but a great source states that "The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites". BE WARY. Do a quit search online on this product (brand does not matter) and you will see that it is yet another gimmick geated to the newest health craze. I have emailed a well-known store and this company only to receive a typical "what are you talking about? this is a great product" response i.e. "this makes us lots of money right now, it is cheap to make, but we sell it for five bucks. We get to phillips screwdriver you. We like to do this."<br /><br />This is one of the first websites I found by just searching now [...]  but I have digged and you can too. The information points you in an obvious direction.<br />Make sure to tell your friends and families!!!! I have only e-mailed one store but I think I will come in to talk to the manager maybe not to pull off of shelves but to have an information pamplet next to this product...I imagine if it was pulled suddenly off of shelves people would be all upset and just find a new source...

Cut or break your favorite vegan energy bar or dark chocolate bar into bite size pieces, add optional raspberries, blueberries or strawberry slices, arrange on a side plate, and swirl agave syrup for a beautiful vegan dessert with a great presentation.  Raw agave is a an alternative to high temp maple syrups. Organic natural alternative to processed corn syrups. Great flavor and consistency. Fantastic vegan substitute for honey. Great for tea.

Target and Wal-mart is way to expensive for this and I did find it at TJ Maxx for a good deal then came across this value and it's a few dollars cheaper so I am sold.  If u do have a costco membership, they sell it there as well.  Much healthier for u as well, great in desserts (like a yogart parfait), coffee or tea. Anything u would put sugar in, replace it with Agave!

I greatly limit my use of all alternative sweetners, i.e. Sweet and Low, Nutrasweet and Splenda.  As it stands for now it is believed to be low on the glycemic index, hopefully it will remain beneficial to those concerned withsugar intake. There is no unpleasant after taste and the price is the best I've found. My only wish is someone produces a dry form of agave, so I may use it in baking!  It tastes delicious.

review/text: I use Agave in a lot of my recipes it is a better alternative if you are wanting a healthier choice to fructose corn syrup or cane sugar. Agave is a far better choice than fructose corn syrup, it has not been Genetically Modified which fructose corn syrup has, fructose corn syrup goes through a lot of process to extract the sugar from corn, it is chemically altered.... NOT GOOD for ANYONE!!! Remember anything even with natural sugars in it like fruit turns into fructose in the body so saying that Agave is bad because of this is misleading. Agave is will not cause a spike in blood sugar like fructose corn syrup or cane sugar. It is a better choice if you care about your health. Anything that is not GMO (genetically modified) is better for you by far!!

review/summary: Agave Nectar = Inulin Syrup = Worse Than Fructose Syrup
review/text: This product and other similar Agave products are as bad or worse than High Fructose Corn Syrup.  This is not a bad comparison or exaggeration.  You are not consuming 'nectar' from the Agave plant, you are consuming the final result of the same process that corn is put through to become Fructose Syrup.  The ONLY reason the FDA has not been able to force this product to be labeled as Fructose Syrup is because it more closely resembles Inulin, which is actually sweeter, and worse in this case, than Fructose Syrup.  Stay away from Agave products unless you want a good Tequila.<br /><br />For further information, see other reviews rated at 1 star, and research online for the bad news.  Don't just shrug it off and ignore it.  If you're like me, you will be disgusted with the feeling of betrayal, and you'll want to warn everybody you can.

review/summary: The facts about Agave
review/text: We all know that too much sugar, or fructose, is bad for you. And that includes agave, which is concentrated fructose. However, I like the taste of agave, especially as compared to other sugar substitutes, and I can use less of it than sugar (see below). It has a lower glycemic index (meaning the body metabolizes it slower reducing the risk of an insulin spike), and it is natural rather than chemically engineered like high fructose corn syrup. The key to all sugars is moderation. Unfortunately, almost all baked or processed foods that we buy are loaded with sugars, especially high fructose corn syrup. At least by baking my own foods I can have more control over my family's sugar consumption and I am happy to have found agave so that when I do occasionally bake sweets, at least I can use less of it.<br /><br />Raw organic blue agave is not chemically processed as some have indicated. It is the pure juice from the blue agave plant. The juice is extracted by stripping the leaves of the plant, then chopping up the bulbous base of the plant which is heated to no more than 118� to get the juice flowing. The actual extraction is accomplished through centrifugal force and the juice obtained is then bottled. (I should mention there are other processes that can be used which would entail heating to a higher temperature, but which still results in juice without additives--although any natural enzymes would be killed at higher heat.)  Blue agave has a glycemic index of 11 as compared to sugar which is 68-85. Calories are the same as sugar but it takes half as much to three quarters as much agave to be as sweet as sugar, meaning less calories for the same sweetness.<br /><br />Compare this process to how High Fructose Corn Syrup is made. Corn kernels are soaked in warm water along with sulfur dioxide (a toxic gas). This makes it easier to separate the starch, hull, protein and oil components. The kernals are then milled wet to remove the oil. The remaining corn starch is washed. Next, three types of genetically-engineered enzymes are added to the resulting starch and water mixture. This breaks down the starch into glucose and fructose to create the desired balance of the two. The final step is an evaporation process to obtain the desired consistency.<br /><br />So, you decide. Agave, (which does retain some minerals and nutrients found in the agave plant), highly refined table sugar with no nutrients, chemically engineered high fructose corn syrup, chemical sugar substitutes, which may have side effects or health risks, or other sweeteners such as Stevia, which is natural but leaves a bitter aftertaste?

review/summary: PLEASE I implore you to do research before buying Blue Agave!
review/text: Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!!<br /><br />Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not.<br /><br />Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It's called miel de agave, and it's made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup.<br /><br />But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, "Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s." In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation's website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write,<br /><br />Agave "nectar" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave.<br /><br />The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into "nectar" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS.<br /><br />Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.<br /><br />So please. I implore each and every one of you to do your own research on this sham of a product and tell everyone you know. Write letters and let the world know that we won't fall prey to loopholes in "Organic Marketing". The fact that so many people use this because they are diabetic is quite frightening.

review/summary: HFAN higher in created Fructose than HFCS
review/text: I had used THIS product for over 2 years. During that time I gained 20 pounds although I was eating a healthy diet (besides adding this agave nectar). I gained the weight mostly in my stomach. My doctor and I were at a loss as to what was causing the weight gain. My cholesterol and triglycerides went up as well as my liver enzymes. A friend told me that this product was made essentially the same way HFCS is made. I didn't want to believe him! I investigated several sources and found that I had been duped about this product. I threw an unopened case (6 bottles) in the garbage. Since then, March 3, 2010, I have lost 10 of the pounds gained (thankfully from my stomach) and and am having fewer problems with swelling and bloating of my hands and feet. I won't know about the cholesterol or the liver enzymes until my next physical. This is a High Fructose "created" sweetener, up to 90% fructose compared to 50-55% found in HFCS. I for one won't let HFCS or HFAN into my house.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Firstly, the product itself - good taste, excellent sweetener, easy to use. It is sort of expensive, so I only buy it on sale. I prefer honey for most sweetening applications, but the agave nectar is actually easier to use, as it is somewhat less viscous and dissolves more easily.<br /><br />On another note, I have never had trouble with the packaging, which is often a problem with gooey liquid items from Amazon. There are seals under the bottle tops, plus shrink wrap over the tops, and the bottles also come shrinkwrapped together. As always, be careful in ordering liquid products through the mail. A rotting box of leaking goo is the bane of the delivery worker and an unwelcome addition to your doorstep.<br /><br />Thirdly, this product comes in other sizes/packaging. I recommend exploring all options to get the best price, and consider Subscribe and Save as well. We can use regular shipments here at our house anyway, since we seldom use granulated sugar.

review/text: I know a lot of people don't want to hear this, but fructose is a major cause of metabolic syndrome, gout, and many other conditions. It doesn't go into your blood stream so it doesn't raise blood glucose, but it doesn't just go away; it goes to your liver and is turned to triglycerides.<br /><br />High fructose corn syrup is only about half fructose. Agave is almost pure fructose, so it is twice as bad. Fructose is fructose whether it comes from cactus or corn.

review/summary: Disagree With Negative Reviews
review/text: A few reviewers commented in a black & white, all or nothing, manner on the evils of agave nectar. The sources and way agave nectar are processed vary from brand to brand. Some are from blue agave, some are from other types of agave plants. Some are created by high tech chemical processing and some are processed minimally at low temperature. The Wholesome Sweetners Organic Blue Agave is (as the title indicates) made from blue agave and not other "wild" types that are cheaper (btw, I'm a regular Amazon consumer and have no connection with this company). "Raw" is a term from the raw foods movement which indicates that this product is produced by very low heat to encourage evaporation, converting the soluble fiber inulin into sugar, and not the high heat that is destroying all the enzymes and creating something chemically different. The more processed "light agave" does have a higher fructose content, but is that a bad thing?<br /><br />The "evils" of fructose is baffling to me. Fructose is what you get from fruit, green peppers, onions, carrots, etc. Fructose is not bad for you. However, the amount that is contained in an orange pales with the massive dose in the "Big Gulp" drink you get at your local convenience market. This reminds me of the bad rap for fats that the government propagandized about for years in their now proven useless nutrition pyramid that we were indoctrinated at school with when we were kids. Fats, too, are essential for your health, but overconsumption of anything (and the wrong kinds, and in the wrong combination with other foods) can be bad for you. In one "scientific" study people were fed large doses of "agave nectar" (I put that in quotes because it turns out that some of these cheap nectars - hey, studies cost money, so get the cheap stuff! - were adulterated with high fructose corn syrup and with maple syrup). Maple syrup is very yummy, but the presence of a non-agave nectar product in the thing you are supposed to be testing is what we call in the scientific world a "confounding variable" (read: invalid study). Additionally, I use a teaspoon of agave nectar and don't drink the bottle like it's a can of Coke. The equating of agave nectar with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is total hornswoggle. Yes, both have fructose, but as we shall see, so does pretty much most other foods we eat.<br /><br />The most common dietary sugars are glucose, fructose, and galactose. These are six carbon mono-saccharides and are the building blocks of most other biologically important sugars, ones that have been used by humans since recorded history. Glucose is also known as dextrose because it is a member of a broader classification of sugars known as dextrins. Dextrins are named because they bend polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory is the term chemists use to describe this physical property). Fructose is also known as laevulose because it bends polarized light to the left (levorotatory is a term chemists use to refer this physical property).<br /><br />By the way, where is sucrose (common table sugar) in this mix? Sucrose is simply the combination of two of the above sugars: glucose and a fructose. The point here is that you're starting to see that this so-called bad fructose is in almost all forms of sweets. Not only in sweets like candy and chocolate bars, but also in virtually every fruit such as apples, pears, berries, melons, bananas, etc. Further, fructose is also found in high amounts in apple cider vinegar, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, every carrot you've ever eaten, broccoli, cucumbers, even squash.<br /><br />Every whole grain has fructose. Please note that this fructose isn't placed in these vegetables and fruits by us evil manufacturers that run laboratories; this fructose is just naturally in these foods. "Well, it's not that all fructose is bad... it's the amounts in each food that matter." Fair enough. Let's briefly look at the amount of fructose in a 200 calorie serving of a few food items. Listed from most fructose to least:<br /><br />Food item  /  mg of fructose  /  Serving size<br /><br />standard US soda beverage / 29,760 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Applesauce, canned & sugared / 28,634 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Honey, US, supposedly awesome / 26,930 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Agave syrup, Mexico, supposedly evil / 26,896 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Apple, raw / 25,125 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Dates, raw, dried / 23,074 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Vinegar, balsamic / 16,773 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br />Strawberries, raw / 15,247 mg / in a 200 calorie serving<br /><br />This information above comes from the USDA's National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference. You can go there and get this info on any food you want. What does this mean? Unless you're living on 100% meat, fructose is a part of the human food chain. It always has been, and will continue to be a part of your diet. Demonizing it is illogical. Some proponents are against agave because they have their own agenda (e.g. one critic is hawking his own healthy honey on his website, which as you can see has slightly more fructose than agave nectar, so what's his illogical point about agave and fructose?). Plus, I don't eat a 200 calorie serving of agave nectar. I use a squirt in my coffee. I'm getting less fructose than what's in an average apple. Let's demonize apples now because they're worse than agave nectar!<br /><br />Fructose has received much negative attention due to the fact that fructose can be converted into fat in the liver. The process of converting fructose into fat is related to the way the fructose is absorbed -- unlike other dietary sugars, fructose is not actively transported into the bloodstream by transport proteins. Instead, fructose -- be it from the banana you ate this morning, the squash soup you had last night, the Coconut Bliss that's in your freezer, or the delicious honey you just dripped into you tea -- is passively absorbed into portal circulation from the GI tract. Portal circulation sends dietary fructose to the liver for further processing. It sends *all* fructose this way.<br /><br />But here's where the anti-agave writers get it wrong. First, there are plenty of things we eat that get processed mainly by the liver; lipids and proteins are just two examples. Secondly, like those fats and proteins, the outcome of fructose in the liver isn't fixed. It can have a number of different fates:<br /><br />1) it can be consumed as fuel (during times of great energy demand),<br />2) it can be converted to glucose and released as blood sugar (during times of energy demand and low blood sugar),<br />3) it can be converted to glucose and converted into glycogen for storage (under well fed state following energy depleted state),<br />4) it can be used as a reducing source for production of NADPH for reductive synthesis (biological molecules are built by reductive synthesis). Or, god forbid,<br />5) it can be converted into fat in the form of triglycerides (overfed state where fructose is not necessary for any other functions and blood triglycerides are low).<br /><br />To simply state that fructose is converted to fat is a gross oversimplification of biochemistry. It's a salesman's pitch. The conversion of fructose to fats as free fatty acids in the liver and ultimately release of fats from the liver as triglycerides requires a specific dietary condition. In biochemistry, it is called "the well-fed state" (that's the actual scientific phrase). In layman terms for you and I, we call this the "you're eating too much, pal, so stop blaming specific food components for your problem" state. This well-fed state of extreme elevation of blood triglycerides is seen in populations that consume very high amounts of saturated fats, and carbohydrates, with simple sugars as the major component of total carbohydrate.<br /><br />Agave contains a fructooligiosaccharide (FOS) known as inulin. Inulin has been shown to have numerous positive impacts on human health due to the propensity for it to increase the population of beneficial bacteria such as acidophilus and bifidus in the human gastro-intestinal tract. One of the many positive benefits these bacteria provide is the reduction in triglyceride production in the liver.<br /><br />Fructose has been suggested to be a possible safe alternative for type II diabetics because fructose has a low glycemic index, and has even been shown to reduce hemoglobin A1c (a marker of long term loss of glycemic control). Small quantities of fructose have been shown to even have a blunting effect on the glycemic response of high glycemic starches (Heacock, Hertzer and Wolf J. Nutr. 132: 2601-2604, 2002).<br /><br />The debate over the relationship between dietary carbohydrate and serum lipid levels is not a new one. Several studies conducted in the 1960's and 1970's showed a relation between a high sugar (50%) and increased triglyceride levels. Two bestseller books took this idea and ran with it. The books were "Sugar Blues" and "Sweet and Dangerous". The studies cited by the authors were short in duration (2-6 weeks), this may have led the authors to assume a false conclusion. This prompted more studies. In later studies that were longer in duration (3-6 months) it was noted that triglyceride levels normalized. This is not to say that a 50% sugar diet is safe or sane. Far from it. However, it does show that making quick conclusions from a small number of studies can lead to false perceptions.<br /><br />The purpose of pointing all this out is to encourage a rational examination of the safety of common sweeteners. You only need to look at healthy old people (or my own, or your own experience with agave) to see that sweeteners used in moderation are fine for human health. Sweeteners can be included in many diets with no adverse health effects, assuming the diet is rich in complex carbohydrates, quality fats (especially essential fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids) and quality lean protein.<br /><br />If you are consuming massive amounts of simple sugars, with saturated fats, low fiber, and poor quality proteins, then the least of your problems is the agave syrup. Instead, the pharmaceutical industry and your local emergency room are ready and waiting. Agave is not HFCS. Apples, bananas, and figs, although high in fructose, are also not HFCS.<br /><br />Debra Lynn Dadd, a consumer advocate who writes for the New York Times covers this topic as well at[...]. Interestingly, she and her husband did their own mini-test where they tried various brands of agave syrup and tested the rise in blood sugar with their own blood glucose meter. This brand above brought the least blood sugar rise of any brands they tested (obviously, this is a limited test and we all vary). In reality, as far as blood sugar results, who cares what some lab does with a bunch of other people with unique body chemistries? Get a small bottle of this (and a couple others), get out your blood glucose meter and do your own test. Your own test with your own body is the only one that counts anyway. Any other lab tests are just general indicators. "Your mileage may vary" as the saying goes.<br /><br />Yes, there is a difference between brands. Some have been adulterated with high fructose syrup and one study (one of the negative ones) found the dark "agave syrup" was actually adulterated with maple syrup (which, while yummy, is sort of getting away from the reason why you're buying agave nectar in the first place). Caveat emptor is always a wise policy.<br /><br />You can go to the manufacturer of this product for more information as to nutrition, where it comes from, what it contains, and how it's produced [...]. This is Mexican blue agave and not something else which other brands may use. Raw agave nectar is heated gently (usually around 118 degrees) and converts the inulin in the agave to the sweet product we are looking for. By this manufacturers description their light agave is heated to 165 degrees and converts the inulin to fructose, so it does have a higer fructose content that the raw does not. Thus, in my humble opinion, I think I'm going to stick with the raw (which I like the taste in my coffee and adds some tasty caramel notes).

review/text: Great product but when UPS delivered it the contents fell out of the bottom of the box.  All it required was a bit more tape.  I was very happy that my great product was not damaged because of the inadequate packaging.

review/summary: Fraudulent
review/text: Yes, I know, I know, agave nectar is supposed to be the answer for for those seeking to address insulin issues, or on low-carb diets, or just want a healthy alternative to sugar, and even honey and maple syrup, let alone high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners.  Yes, I've done the research, am personally interested in both organic and low glycemic index products, and used agave nectar for a couple of years myself, proudly serving it to my friends.<br /><br />Despite the great enthusiasm for agave nectar and the endless hype from folks who should know better, I hate to tell you, but it's baloney--a very successful and clever marketing campaign to promote a sweetener that's no better for you, and very likely worse, than many of the other sweeteners it replaces.<br /><br />First, forget any mental image of a "nectar" naturally flowing from the majestic agave cactus; this product is created in factories through a chemical refining process, much the same way as high fructose corn syrup, from the starchy root of the agave plant and is, in fact, a refined high frustose product stripped of any nutrient value. It has a higher fructose content than high frustose corn syrup.  While high fructose agave "nectar" won't spike your blood sugar levels, the fructose in it will cause: mineral depletion, liver inflammation, hardening of the arteries, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, obesity, and may be toxic for use during pregnancy.<br /><br />If you think I'm making this up or shilling for some manufacturer of a competing sweetener, just google "agave fraud" and see for yourself.  I wish it were otherwise.<br /><br />On October 27, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported:<br /><br />"[T]he Glycemic Research Institute, a Washington, D.C., laboratory, issued a warning Friday that diabetics experienced "severe and dangerous side effects" during testing of an agave nectar. "The diabetics passed out on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital," says Ann de Wees Allen, chief of biomedical research at the lab. She declined to say how much of the product the diabetics consumed during the test, saying that would be disclosed after a complete analysis of the results.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The lab has stopped testing agave on humans amid safety concerns. Also, Dr. Allen says the lab refused to test four other agave products after a chemical analysis it commissioned from another lab found they were mixed with high-fructose corn syrup, which was not disclosed on the label. She declined to name the brands."<br /><br />Wikipedia's entry for agave notes: "the extremely high percentage of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation," citing:<br /><br />Basciano H, Federico L, Adeli K (2005). "Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia". Nutrition & Metabolism 2 (5). doi:10.1186/1743-7075-2-5PMID PMC552336;<br />Mayes, PA (1993). "Intermediary metabolism of fructose". Am J Clin Nutr. Nov: 58. PMID 8213607;<br />Buemann B, Toubro S, Holst JJ, Rehfeld JF, Bibby BM, Astrup A (2000). "D-tagatose, a stereoisomer of D-fructose, increases blood uric acid concentration". Metabolism Aug (49): 969-76. PMID 10954012; and<br />Davis, W (2008). "Yet another reason to avoid fructose".

review/text: I loved this product and would buy it again IF I had not discovered that it actually has more fructose than HFCS (high fructose corn syrup), and so is not a good choice for diabetics at all even though it has been touted as such.<br /><br />Splurge for good quality organic maple syrup or raw honey and enjoy the additional micronutrient health benefits instead. Don't be fooled like I was--unless you don't care about the fructose (which causes inflamation, etc. etc. etc)

review/summary: Agave is Great
review/text: This product is super for diabetics. The product does not boost the glucose level all at once, but spreads it out over the course of 3-4 hours, so you do not get a rush all at once. I find it useful as a sweetener, for use as a syrup in place of honey or maple syrup. It is sweeter, so needs to be cut back. When a recipe calls for 1/2 cup sugar, it should be replaced with about 1/4 - 1/3 c. of Agave.

review/text: This is a great alternative healthy sweetener. Just takes a little experimentation to figure the best ratio to substitute for sugar in different things. The best part about this is the amazing price on Amazon. In the store the small 8 or 10 ounce bottles sell for about $7, so for just over double the price you get 10 times the sweetener - and I don't have to leave the house!

review/summary: Agave - A Good Substitute for Sugar
review/text: Imagine using the tequila plant as a safe, healthy alternative for sugar!<br />Agave is a natural product with twice the sweetness of sugar, but it does have calories, which must be  taken into account for those who count calories. It is safer than sugar in that, unlike sugar, you don't get a sudden let down after that<br />sudden sugar high.  Agave gives the energy of sugar, but lets you down slowly.  Agave has a mild maple syrup taste which is delicious in both tea and coffee.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001P74NXM">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave, 44 Ounce Bottle (Pack of 2)</a>

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I bought this at my local Costco for only $8 instead of $18 here on Amazon (same bottle sizes and a 2 pack as well).  I use it instead of maple syrup for my pancakes.  I am not sure if it is really bad for you or not (kind of mixed reviews from the peanut gallery here).  I will finish the bottles anyway.  Oh and for people who compare this to HFCS, HFCS cannot be organic or raw by any means so I hardly believe it is THAT bad for you.

review/text: I cant live without this stuff! I use it in coffee and all my cooking that would normally require sugar or honey. It doesnt have a strong taste so it doesnt change the taste of the food. It is really sweet so you dont need to use a lot. The Raw darker color is better than the lighter color. It has a more intense sweetness, the lighter isnt as sweet.

review/summary: Did something change?
review/text: The following is a review a just wrote for the 6 23.5oz bottles but applies here as well.<br /><br />"I have had this on subscription for at least the last 2 years. When my last subscription order was sent there was something very off on the flavor.<br />Each bottle had about a half inch of foam on top and had a very strong plastic or soapy taste. It's hard to describe but it was so bad I was unable to use it. I contacted Amazon and they were great, sent out a new order right away but when I received the shipment it was as bad as the first. When I contacted Amazon again they refunded my purchase price and actually made this product unavailable while they checked in to it. I see it is available again but I never found out what the issue was.<br />I figured it must have been a bad batch so I reordered and did get a new shipment last week, this time of the 2 44 oz bottles. It was just as bad. I contacted customer service and they were great and promptly refunded my money.<br />I ended up ordering another very popular, but more expensive, brand. This 'other' brand is much better. No problems at all. "

review/text: I had been using this agave for about four years now and since I've always been pleased with this particular product I went to the product page to post a review. After reading a review here by R. Yoo I was having second thoughts about recommending this product and decided to do a little research on both the review contents and the subsequent comments about agave.<br /><br />These discussions bring up some interesting points about the nutritional value of agave and also its impact on your health. For me, I guess it's just going to be a combination of staying as close to the natural form of what I eat and consuming in moderation.<br /><br />For sweetening, I'll continue to use honey, maple syrup, this agave, as well as Wholesome's Organic Fair Trade Sugar as well.

review/summary: Agave raw organic
review/text: yummy. I use this in many ways such as to add a touch to salad dressings, flavor and sweeten smoothies, pour over cereal, add to unsweetened yogurt.  I love especially that it is raw and organic. I am not totally fed by raw food but like adding as much raw to my diet as possible. Made some raw buckwheat cookies a few days ago and sweetened them with this.  Shared 'em with several friends who really liked my raw, dairyless, eggless, wheatless, sugarless cookies.<br /><br />When I do bake sweets, I often use agave and my husband will add it to his coffee... nice flavor.

Even more disappointing when you find this is the among the items-groceries-that cannot be returned.  You are stuck with the loss.  I am leery to proceed, not knowing if the next package will arrive with the same damage.  Generally, Amazon responds quickly, to orders, etc.  To date (from 2 months) there has been no response to my request.

review/summary: Great stuff, I use it for a simple syrup for sweetening iced tea
review/text: I love sweet iced tea, but don't necessarily like the glycemic load of sugar.  I've tried virtually all artificial and low/no-calorie sweeteners, and they either taste horrible or give me gastric distress.<br /><br />My wife also loves iced tea, but not as sweet as I do, so we came up with a system for sweetening on demand.  As any of you iced tea aficionados out there probably know, normal granulated table sugar will not dissolve in cold tea, and it's easiest to sweeten the tea when it's hot just after brewing, but then the sweetness level is set for that batch.<br /><br />So, what we do is create a simple syrup consisting of 1 part organic evaporated cane juice sugar, 3 parts of this organic raw agave syrup, and 2 parts hot water.  We put those in a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE52">NALGENE Tritan 1-Quart Narrow Mouth BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>, shake it up for a minute, and voila, a very sweet liquid that we store in the fridge next to the tea.  Then, when we pour a glass of tea we splash some of the syrup in it to taste, and it mixes up nicely even in the cold tea.<br /><br />And the taste of this agave sweetener is excellent.  It is not exactly like table sugar, it has a hint of a molasses or dark brown sugar flavor, but only a hint, and nothing 'artificial' or 'aftertaste'-y.<br /><br />And, yes, I know this is still sugar with empty calories, but I try to use it in moderation and figure that the lower glycemic load of agave is better than full-on refined table sugar, and the fact that both ingredients are organic make me feel better about it as well.

review/text: Too much information can obviously be a paralyzing thing.  I have been reading the reviews and see very limited emphasis on the processing of this item as compared to corn syrup or sugar or other hugely, mass-produced sweeteners.  Pls go back to your research with digestion and absorption in mind?  It really makes an important difference.

review/summary: GREAT PRICE, BUT, SOME RESERVATIONS....
review/text: If you go to the grocery store, you get a little bottle of Agave Nectar for about $7.00.  This 2-pack gives you two huge bottles for the price of two little ones.  I do love agave and use it in my coffee and tea...even iced tea.  I haven't really baked with it, I must admit.  I gave this four stars because I have read mixed reviews and information regarding the actual health benefits of the stuff.  Some say it is no better than corn syrup while others tout it as low glycemic and good for you.  In my experience, I do find that when I use it a lot, my cravings for sweets increases...which leaves me to assume the former is probably true (darn!).  I also find that when I use it a few times a day (I drink a lot of iced coffee and tea), my weight starts to edge up.  Again, probably a testament to the info that says it is just corn syrup in another format.  It is delicious and it is a good price, so, you'll have to come to your own conclusions regarding agave syrup!  BTW, prickly pear juice, from cactus, has been proven to lower blood sugar.  A lot of people think agave is a cactus and, therefore, has the same properties.  In actuality, agave is a member of the lily family!
