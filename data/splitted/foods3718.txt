review/text: These mashed potatoes are incredible.  Quick, easy and taste like homemade.  The only issue is the cost.  This same box was about half the price at Costco, however it's apparently a seasonal item for Costco and they won't be carrying them again until Fall.  Other than the price, the service from Amazon was great.

review/summary: Best ever!
review/text: These are simply the best instant mashed potatoes I have ever had. What's even better is that there are only 3 ingredients..potatoes and little bit of butter and salt. If you look at other brands you'll see an ingredient list list of 10-20 different things..including preservatives. I have been buying them at Costco for the last year now all of a sudden they are gone. I would think this prodict would be hugely popular..they are really that good.

review/text: You're not going to believe me, but I just looked at my receipt, I paid $9.99 at Costco on 4/19/12 for this same 14 package box.  We LOVE these mashed potatoes.  This is the first time we've bought them, and providing Costco continues to sell them, they will be a staple in our pantry.  They are very easy to make, no mess like when you make them from the big ole box.  The package says it has 8 servings, we have a family of 4 and each of us has a hefty serving (or 2...) with some leftover.  MUST TRY!

review/summary: Think you hate instant Mashed potatoes? Think again...
review/text: I loathe instant mashed potatoes. Seriously. I can always taste the difference. I get upset with restaurants that tell me they make their own but don't. I won't eat them, though others in my family will. My local store had a clearance on these--a real deal (3 packets for $1), so I bought them for those that do like them, a rainy-day kind of thing. Well, it 'rained' last night. After I made them, I tried them, just to see how much they needed doctoring and what I had to add to make them nearly palatable. To my shock and amazement--they needed NOTHING! They tasted like my own homemade mashed 'taters. I ate them along with everyone else. Now I'm sorry that I only bought a dollar's worth. We're having them again tonight--by popular choice. Try them. I think you, too, will be pleasantly shocked. And no mashing, either:)

review/summary: The best easy-to-prepare mashed potatoes
review/text: Am delighted to discover others who agree that Honest Earth All Natural Creamy Mash (mashed potatoes) are the best "boxed" mashed potatoes, because they are! For several months, have searched for them at Costco to no avail.  Resorted to writing them, imploring them to restock the item.  Thought I would sample a few competitive products, including Idahoan which manufactures Honest Earth, and to our family's utter disappointment, returned them all.  Without exception, they emitted strange odors when prepared as directed, and worse, off-flavors when served and taste-tested.  May we soon see the return of an excellent product which contains no additives, preservatives--just potatoes, butter and sea salt.

review/summary: Great taste but watch the price
review/text: Purchased these a few days ago at $17 with Prime shipping.  2 days later, the package arrived.  The individually packaged 8 person serving size (should feed about 4-5 in the real world) is great - no more box full of potato fluff sitting in my kitchen closet, waiting to explode on my floor if dropped.  The day it arrived, I re-checked the price at Amazon - over $30...WTF that's a big increase.  Next day, we tried the 'taters.  As all the previous reviewers here have stated, they were great.  Creamy and smooth just like my family likes it.  Healthy ingredients, just like I like.  Quick and easy to prepare.  Current price with shipping (no longer prime and no free shipping) is $41.  At $17, these are fantastic.  At $41, it's crossed off my list.  How do you justify a 241% price increase in under a week?  Hopefully they'll restore the original price.  I hate finding a great food that's too expensive to buy on a regular basis.

review/summary: GREAT vegan jerky option!
review/text: I want to preface my review by saying that I tried Primal Spirit jerky first, and absolutely HATED it (sorry, Primal Spirit). The texture was all wrong (very moist, not chewy), and the smell and taste really reminded me of dog treats. I decided to give Tasty Eats Soy Jerky a chance, and it is SO much better!<br /><br />First, the flavor is really delicious. I got the Hot & Spicy variety, and it's very tasty with just a little spice (I would like it a little spicier, actually, but it's still great). I can't wait to try some other flavors next.<br /><br />Second, the texture is very similar to real jerky. It's drier and chewier. I am a vegetarian, so sometimes I miss really chewing on something. This jerky is great for that.<br /><br />All in all, Tasty Eats Soy Jerky is a fantastic product. My carnivore boyfriend likes it too, although admittedly not as much as real beef jerky. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: I Prefer Primal Strips
review/text: I purchased Primal Strips brand vegan jerky about a year ago. It was absolutely delicious! The texture and flavor were perfect; reminiscent of beef jerky (which I've not had in over a decade), but better. Cleverly spiced, and very savory! Slightly rough to chew.<br /><br />I planned on ordering Primal Strips again, but went with Tasty Eats due to the strength of the reviews. I just cracked it open and had a pack, and I'm regretting my decision.<br /><br />Tasty Eats jerky is good, but it does not compare to Primal Strips. Tasty Eats jerky is VERY rough to chew. It's quite a workout for your jaw. I can feel it in my teeth, jaw, and the top of my head. Not to sound like a baby, but - waaaaa. The main flavors that come through are salt and red pepper, rather than various spices.<br /><br />Though Tasty Eats may taste more like real beef jerky, Primal Strips taste better.

review/summary: Great Product matches expectations
review/text: This jerky, along with all the jerky products, *we called the company, is made without any onion or garlic powder. This is the real deal and unsweetened. For any one with diet or who wants to simply refrain from sugar, this is the best jerky available; all three flavors that are unsweetened.<br /><br />  Yet, most people prefer, at least all our friends, the Teriyaki, Original, Hot n' Spicy and Peppered as well as the Ginger flavor. These are sweetened. I ordered 6 cases of Ginger direct from the company because I and all my friends find this to be the best quality and best texture of them all. We are also getting a great deal; yet, I would pay more for this jerky.

Each little packet is supposed to be 2 servings at 45 calories each, but who are we kidding?  Is there ANYONE out there who could, or would, divide a 1 ounce package into two portions?  Doubtful.  That being said, this stuff is terrific.  It has great jerky flavor and texture and is wonderfully packable.  I keep some in my office desk in case of a munchie attack.  Yum!

review/summary: Wish I Could Say That I Liked It
review/text: I wanted to like it, since it is so much healthier than most alternatives. But the taste just isn't there. My daughter and I both immediately said the same thing after tasting it. While it is indeed spicy (i.e., hot), it is also sweet, which sort of deadens the spiciness of the flavor. We wish that we hadn't ordered two boxes of this, but had tried a different flavor instead. Perhaps we will. But it is somewhat disconcerting to consider that we might also not like the taste of the different flavor, since the cost of the product is not inexpensive. Thus we are not yet sure that we will order more.

review/text: This has a definite Jerky texture. It is low in calories. Does state Hot N Spicy but its not. It is actually a bit sweet. That is just my opinion as I eat raw serrano peppers. I have had others that were good tasting yet too high in fat so that was not worth it. This one has been a regular one for me for quite some time.

review/text: I just got this in the mail and immedaetly tore into a pack.

If the teriyaki didnt have such a strong cocoa smell I would rate this a 5 for sure.

review/summary: Simply the BEST!
review/text: My friends and I have tried many vegetarian jerky products and this is the Best. 1) the Taste of the Ginger Jerky is by far better quality and texture than others. In fact, many consider tastyeats Teriyaki or Original to be even better. They were sold out of all those, so only had the Ginger and three of the Jerkys that are unsweetened.<br /><br /> Most important, they do not use any garlic or onion in their products so, to use an Ayurvedic term, it is Sathwic. In other words, it doesn't give one the effects that garlic or onion has on the system. Also, the taste, we feel, is the very best around. The company is simply first class to offer this product, so I have phoned them direct and ordered 6 cases of the Ginger. I will order the Teriyaki, Original, Hot n'Spicy, Peppered when those become available.<br /><br />  As an aside, we have tried other products/companies, and in fact, one jerky company has the ingredient as "vegetarian spices" and in this ingredient is granulated garlic, possibly onion. Other jerky companies may have "spices" but at least list garlic or onion powder, so forth. This Company has found a formula without these and it is a Blessing.

review/summary: Not as expected
review/text: I ordered Soy Jerky for four reasons:  recommended by HG, was a source of protein, was easy to send to a relative who is stationed overseas, and was easy to take as a snack when going to ball tournaments.  The jerky satisfies all of the reasons; however, the taste was not even close to the teriyaki beef jerky (pre-vegetarian days).  My granddaughter even commented that it tasted like the dog's treats (which she had tasted at some point), and my dog does like the jerky better than anyone else who has tried it.<br /><br />Overtime I will still eat it, but I won't order more.

They're far too dry and require much more jaw-work than should be required to enjoy some jerky.<br /><br />Plus, with only 12 packets, it seems you get less product for the price than you do with the other vegan jerkies available on Amazon.  With so much better stuff out there, I wouldn't waste my money on this product again, even to try a different flavor.

How can they say this is 100% pure fruit PULP, when the product is actually very watery (nothing resembling pulp, no density)and VERY SUGARY. Very little left of the real fruit! I was going to use it to make what I hoped would be a passion fruit mousse for my daughter's birthday, but could not do it because it was so sugary. And there was little taste of passion fruit, which I know well.<br />A number of other passion fruit products in your website were correctly described as "drinks" or "syrup",and therefore I did not order them. Instead, I ordered 12 bottles of the Temptation juice and now wish could return the 11 which were left... But the weight probably makes it not worth it.What Grocery and Gourmet Food should do is have the remaining bottles be picked up for free and either refund the money or give me a voucher that I can use to buy real passion fruit juice!!!

I took an instant liking to it, even though I was not sure what the ingredients were, because all the packaging was in Chinese. I later learned that the main ingredients were black sesame seed powder and sugar. I have a sweet tooth and I love all things containing sesame oil or seeds, so this was an instant hit with me.<br /><br />When I returned to the U.S., friends from Taiwan kept sending more black sesame porridge, but eventually it ran out and I ordered it here on Amazon<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LQPLOI">Black Sesame Instant Cereal Mix Powder (8 Sachets) - 14 Oz</a>. It was just as good as the one from Taiwain. I highly recommend this to anyone who is not diabetic. It does contain a lot of sugar. It's very easy to prepare: pour the powder into a bowl and add boiling water.

review/summary: The best "stock" I've found in the grocery store
review/text: I have been on a soup-making kick for awhile now, and while I much prefer to make my own chicken stock, I do it so rarely that it turns directly into chicken soup. So I bought various chicken stocks, mostly organic, and really started to notice a difference in the resulting soups. I began to pay more attention to the stocks I was using: color, saltiness, depth. Kitchen Basics is the hands-down winner and I cannot use anything else now. It's not bright, scary yellow, but a darker, deeper color. The flavor and smell really does come across as natural, and it's not really salty tasting.<br /><br />I did put "stock" in quotes only because I'm still confused about it being stock if it doesn't have that gelatinous texture when it cools, but I do not know of any stock you can purchase that has that. If anyone does, please share!

review/summary: I want to barf.
review/text: I wanted to try making red curry at home since it's delicious. I saw this at the grocery store and was so excited that I bought two bottles. I bought lots of vegetables and good jasmine rice to go with it. As soon as I opened the bottle I tasted a little with my finger. I wanted to be sick. It's sour like sour milk. I was cooking for two other people though so I tried to make the best of it. I added two whole cans of coconut milk, an entire handful of basil and another of cilantro, chicken flavoring, sambal oelek, sugar, salt, anything I thought would help. It ended up edible somehow, but I couldn't eat much because I still had the horrible taste in my mouth. Do not buy this product unless you need to punish yourself for something bad you've done in the past.

review/text: I've purchased this sauce repeatedly and enjoy it.  I wouldn't call it authentic, but it has some curry (powder) in it and is very tasty. We usually serve it with pan seared chicken, green beans and either peppers or mushrooms, all served over rice.  I'm not sure what the deal with the other VERY negative reviews is. Meh...

review/text: This does have a slight curry flavor, but some other awful flavor overpowers the sauce. To make it tolerable, I had to add peanut butter, sugar, and chipotle pepper. And even then, it wasn't great. It's not very spicy either (coming from someone who likes very spicy food). I will not buy this again, and it was so bad, I won't be buying any of the other curry sauces Kikkoman offers.

review/summary: Teeccino's Maya Caff&eacute;
review/text: I'm quite the coffeeholic and am trying to cut back on caffeine.  I've tried several decaffeinated coffees, but have found the taste to be flat even when blended with regular coffee.  I've recently discovered Teeccino's Maya Caff&eacute;, which is their dark roast that blends well with regular coffee for a very tasteful half and half mix.  It even tastes great by itself.  Now I can have a great cup of coffee without as much buzz.

It has the richness of coffee, and a energy kick, without caffiene.  I was much surprised and pleased.<br /><br />It may not replace Starbucks, but if you want to kick caffiene, or even just looking for a warm rich beverage that's suitable for evening, I'd recommend this product highly!

review/summary: Tastes a little like Postum
review/text: I bought three 11 oz (312 gram) bags of the Maya French Roast.  Because I have a heartbeat irregularity, and have been advised to go off caffeine, I was looking for something that tastes OK and doesn't have caffeine.  I am a real coffee hound, and would sip it all day.  The Teeccino blend doesn't smell much like coffee, and it tastes a little like the Postum I used to drink more than 15 years ago--kind of sweet.  I find a gently rounded tablespoon of it for two 8 oz. cups of water in a drip coffee maker is just right for me.  Any more and the flavor is overpowering.  I think I'll be ordering a second batch of three bags plus something else from Amazon that will put me over the $25 order mark and qualify for free shipping and handling.

review/summary: Caution: This product is mostly Carob
review/text: The smell of Carob overwhelms everything else and makes up half of the flavor. I was hoping this was an organic version of "Pero" (an German instant coffee substitute made from Barley, Malted Barley, Chicory, and Rye). No such luck. The Carob destroys what could have been a good product. YUCK! FYI, the ingredients are Organic Carob, organic barley, organic chicory, organic ramon nuts, natural coffee flavor. Notice how chicory (a nice substitute all by itself) is almost last. This does not taste anything close to coffee-like to me. :(

review/text: When I had to stop all caffeinated and decafeinated coffees and teas, my doctor introduced Teeccino to me. An excellent coffee alternative and more. No acid stomach, reduced palpatations, and it even has fiber and other nutrients! A family member is receiving treatments for cancer and can't have coffees which he loves, now he is enjoying Teeccino and even has told the cancer center about it so they can pass the word on. I prefer the Maya French Roast but they have many flavors too.

review/summary: Great replacement for Coffee, Easy on stomach
review/text: After having to give up coffee, and really missing being able to sip a nice hot mug of java each morning, I found reviews for Teeccino. I bought first a small box of the "Tee Bags." As soon as I opened the envelope, the smell was rich and wonderful. The prepared beverage was very good and I enjoyed it so much! So I ventured out again to get a bag of the "loose" grounds that you "brew" like you would coffee. Again, I was VERY pleased! I find the aroma and flavor to be very satisfying. Better than the "cold brew" coffee I had been trying to drink.<br /><br />I read some reviews likening this product to "Postum." I found something like Postum at my health food store called "Kaffree Roma" which is made by Kellogg's. It is an instant beverage with similar ingredients to the Teeccino. So I tried that as well. I did not think it was quite as good as the Teeccino. The flavor of the Roma was a bit sesame-like.<br /><br />I highly recommend the Teeccino. It might not be exactly the same taste as coffee, but it really is close. And if you don't like one variety, try a different flavor. Also, one reviewer said the Teeccino was "bitter." I have noticed this happened when I accidentally brewed mine too long. So if it's bitter, shorten your brew time.<br /><br />UPDATE, MAY 20, 2012:  I have been using the Teeccino for a few months now. I have absolutely no problems with my stomach when drinking it! Although we LOVE the other flavors as well (especially Vanilla Nut and Chocolate) we find that we still drink the French Roast most often. I have even gotten my husband to switch from coffee to Teeccino now!!<br /><br />Some tips for new Teeccino drinkers: After you decide which flavor you like best, utilize the "subscribe" option. You can get any flavor and YOU can pick how often you want an order; monthly, every 2 or 3 months, etc. It will save you a little bit on each bag and makes life easy since you don't forget to re-order.<br /><br />Also, we have prepared our Teeccino different ways; coffee pot, french press, Teeccino bags, etc. We have found that we prefer the Teeccino when prepared in a French Press. This method also seems to use WAY less Teeccino, making it an even better choice. For our press (which holds about 4 cups) we use 2 rounded Tbsp. of Teeccino. We have not experienced ANY bitterness preparing our "coffee" this way.

review/summary: A good replacement!
review/text: Due to health problems, I had to give up coffee.  But I fought it until the very end.  First it was no more alcohol or sugar.  Then it was wheat.  Somedays all I felt like I do was go to my backyard and graze on my lawn.  So I ignored the coffee thing.  Sheesh!  I had given up everything else!  I did however, cut back to one cup and even that was torture!  I could drink coffee all day.  I love the taste and smell.<br /><br />But when recovery was slow, the coffee thing kept coming up. Desperate to get better, I agreed to give it up. But what to drink instead?  I hate tea because it tastes like wet socks.  I did some research and came across this product and I love it.  Does it taste JUST like coffee?  No, but it tastes close enough that I will be able to switch over no problem.  I brewed a pot as soon as it arrived and loved being able to sip on a few cups throughout the day.  My husband came home and made the last bit into iced coffee.  He said it was agreeable enough to him that he would switch too.  That says a lot!<br /><br />I do drink my coffee with sweetener and cream, so maybe that is why the taste is okay.  Maybe for those who like their coffee black it would be hard to make the switch.

review/summary: Good coffee substitute with reservations...
review/text: I am on a lower carb eating routine and wanted to cut out some caffeine as well.  I bought a bag of light roast Teeccino as it was available locally to be sure I like it.  I really like the chocolate mint, so I figured I'd love the darker French Roast.  I bought the 3 pack from Amazon of French Roast.  I like the flavor of it, but after looking at the label, it has ~2x the carbs for the same number of calories.  It's not a lot of carbs per cup, granted, but it adds up fast if you are on a carb restricted diet.<br /><br />So it's a tasty substitute, but if you are trying to maintain a lower carb diet, the lighter roast versions are perhaps a better choice.

But if you are looking for something a little closer to a coffee taste, this is the one to get. Remember this is herbal coffee, don't expect it to taste exactly like it. However, this comes pretty darn close in my opinion! Much tastier than decaf coffee and SO much better for you. Love it!!!!!

review/text: I've been off coffee for a couple years now.  Entirely, so I figured trying this now I'd have a good sense of how close it is to what I miss.  It's not coffee, lets get that out of the way.  You won't be thinking WOW! but like me, you might be thinking, this will work.  I think the texture is very similar to what I recall and that's what sets it apart from herbal teas.  I suspect this is due in part to some of the oils that naturally occur in the ingredients, just like coffee has.  If you're into flavored coffees, this is even closer to those I think than just a straight up cup o' joe.  I am enjoying my first cup and hope to enjoy many more.

review/summary: Best caffeine and low acid coffee you'll ever taste
review/text: I am sensitive to caffeine and drink high quality freshly ground decaffeinated coffee every morning.  I saw a Teeccino sample in my local health food store and tried it.  It is nothing short of spectacular.  The dark roast is absolutely excellent tasting; the low acid makes it smooth and sublime to drink. As a coffee snob, I would never have even considered a coffee alternative before, but I am switching from coffee to this product simply because it tastes better than my best coffee. Also, I love that it is 100% caffeine free, not just decaffeinated.  With the exception of swiss water processed decaf, chemicals are used to remove caffeine from coffee and that can't be good. Go to their website to get a free sample.

review/text: I love coffee...it's been a part of my daily routine since I was 12.  However, caffeine is starting to trigger acid reflux AND is making me jittery - with only a cup or two!  I've tried decaf, but just not the same and plus it still triggers the reflux.  So I ordered the Teeccino Maya French Roast and just tried it.  It is great!  Like other reviewers have stated, it has a definite nutty taste, but very rich. I will be ordering this from now on.  I tried it iced and it was also really good.  My children love it and I can feel good about them drinking it too!  The bonus is that we lived in Guatemala for a few years, so I am very happy to support organic farmers there.

review/summary: Not bad, good price, I'm satisfied
review/text: I have been having migraine seizures and was told to say WAY away from caffeine.  Well drat.  I tried this coffee in French Roast. That is what I usually get in regular coffee.  No, it doesn't smell like coffee. It smells like chocolate. Must be the carob.  I followed the directions exactly to be sure I could judge it fairly. I used the cone drip and the coffee maker.  Both came out the same. My verdict is it tastes like coffee.  I like it. I won't give it a five star. It's not Starbucks or a higher quality coffee but I have had coffee that was worse by far.  It does taste like coffee to me. I use half and half in my coffee and it tastes close enough for me that the switch is not problem.  I also like the Ganocafe Classic and the Cafe Avarle Black Healthy Coffee.  They are way  more expensive but I think taste even more like coffee and they do give you a nice boost of energy without the caffeine gitters.  Teeccino is much cheaper than both of these `healthy coffees'.  I don't think it gives `as much' of an energy boost as the other two do but you do get a pick up from it.  So you have options.  Teeccino I saw someplace also offers a trial pack of different flavors. I haven't tried that yet but I most likely will. If not on a budget I would choose the other coffees.  I don't see much difference in the two so go with the cheaper one which is the Cafe Avarle. If you are on a budget get the Teeccino. It's not bad.

review/summary: Better than I was expecting!
review/text: Having gone to half-caffeine, then full decaf, and still being advised to use coffee only as medicine, 3 cups a month, I checked out coffee alternatives. This is the first I've tried and based on the reviews of other grounds, I went with the French Roast. This is much better than I'd hoped! No, it doesn't taste like coffee, but it does have its own very rich flavor. Based on other reviews I brewed it a little stronger than the package directions, about 2 3/4 TBS for 4 cups. It is very good with half and half, with chocolately tones and a velvety texture. For a minute I forgot what I was drinking and thought I had made a hot chocolate. I like dark dark chocolate, and a good pint of Guinness occasionally so the bitter undertone suits me fine. For others, it may be too much. I was pleasantly surprised and will drink this again.

review/text: We have been drinking decaf coffee (which still has a bit of caffeine) for several years but I was interested in trying the Teeccino which has absolutely no caffeine.<br /><br />The manufacturer strongly recommends starting out mixing a small amount of the Teeccino with your coffee and gradually increasing the amount of Teeccino.  This is the best way to acclimatize yourself to the slightly different taste of even the Maya French Roast which is the closest to actual coffee. Also take note that this is STRONG stuff and you need less of it than you do of your ground coffee.<br /><br />We sampled different "flavors" of Teeccino before ordering this 3 pack from Amazon. My husband liked all of the flavors we tried but the ones with the dates and other fruits in them were too sweet for my taste unless I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the pot and then the result was closer to a dessert coffee than a morning drink.  This Maya French Roast suits both of us.<br /><br />I considered going back to drinking our favorite brand of decaf without the Teeccino added, but the other day my husband made a pot of plain coffee (Newman's organic Green Mountain fair trade brand) which we used to really enjoy.  It was so bland I couldn't wait to finish it and get back to our coffee/Teeccino blend!  That's when I logged on to Amazon and ordered the 3 pack.

review/summary: Pleasantly surprised. This just might work...
review/text: Ever since I discovered really good coffee in Venice I've been a coffee fanatic. I bought a very nice espresso machine and lived happily ever after...until I started having various health problems my doctor had the nerve to imply were possibly related to my coffee...sigh...When I heard the news, after an extended period of denial and mourning, I tried some low-acid coffee. That stuff reminded me of what you have to wash off the rags in auto shop. Finally I gave up and decided that at least I would die happy with the aroma of my latte filling my nostrils and soothing my brain. That is until today. I noticed this bag of coffee at my local health food store. I took note that it was organic, and it looked like coffee. Good start.<br /><br />I asked the clerk if it was popular and it was. (Another good sign.) It was on sale, but it was still quite a bit more than Amazon Prime's auto delivery price. I decided to give it a try, but I only gave it about a ten percent chance of being worthy of mingling with "the good stuff" in my machine.<br /><br />I made a double shot of "half and half," thinking I would have to throw it out because it doesn't smell at all like coffee. I'm always willing to try something, though. At first sip I was a little disappointed, but I adjusted pretty quickly and realized it wasn't bad. Is it as good as my Green Mountain Organic? No. Is it good? Yes. It's good.<br /><br />I'm going to buy it again. I think it will work for me. If I feel better it will be worth it all. I'm glad somebody made something that is close enough to be called coffee. Time will tell. Just don't judge it by its smell. Take a sip.

review/summary: Best coffee substitute
review/text: I've tried various coffee substitutes and found them barely tolerable.  Teeccino is something I really enjoy, especially iced, and really don't miss the coffee.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Great Coffee Substitute
review/text: If you are looking for a coffee substitute, this is a great option.  I gave up coffee 5 years ago and enjoy drinking Teecino as well as regular tea.  Teecino has a full taste and some great flavors.  If you want something that has full flavor, no caffeine and is totally organic, I recommend Teecino.  I enjoy the Maya and the French Vanilla flavor.

review/summary: It's not coffee!
review/text: We really wanted a product that tasted like coffee and this is slightly similar.  But we were disappointed because it just doesn't have that coffee flavor.  We bought three bags and we have 2 and one-half left.  We just can't "get it down."  If you do buy it, make sure you follow the instructions otherwise it will come out too "thick."

review/summary: It's Not Coffee or even Coffee Like!
review/text: Well for reasons I will not go into here I needed to give up my morning caffeine habit.  This was a major problem for me since I am a coffee lover!  I don't just drink coffee for the kick, I also drink it for the flavor which I adore.  When I say adore, let me explain that further by saying I have worked in the coffee industry and tasted some of the best coffees on the planet! My favorite of all time being sun dried, Tanzanian Peaberry! So, suffice it to say, I'm a bit of a coffee nut. I mean, I'm the black no sugar coffee guy, and I've been drinking coffee since High School. So, having to give it up coffee completely was a horrifying thought!<br />  After my thoughts of suicide subsided I decided to look into some of the coffee alternatives just to see what's available.  I thought, "If I can't have coffee, maybe I can have something that tastes like coffee?" Right?  WRONG!!!  I reviewed several products, and coffee substitutes paying close attention to the reviewers comments regarding product flavor.  I realized that these products would not taste exactly like coffee, but I was looking for the product that was "Most Coffee Like", and Teeccino was rated highest in these categories.  I believed that I was onto something grand!  A coffee substitute that actually tastes "like" coffee.  I mean what is the point of a "Coffee Substitute" if it doesn't actually taste like coffee? Boy was I in for a let down!<br />  Upon receiving the product I immediately read the instructions on how to "Brew" my Teeccino.  I put on some water to boil and waited with great anticipation, almost like a kid on Christmas morning.  In the past I have used a French Press for coffee, but for this application I thought manual drip would be a better fit. When I began to pour the water over this concoction, I began to smell something tangy, almost sour.  It did not smell anything like coffee.  Once my cup was brewed, I brought it to my nose, and the Teeccino smelled burnt, liked burned sugar and raisins.  The taste? Well, Teeccino has all of the negative qualities of bad coffee, but without actual coffee flavor. It is very acidic and bitter with an after taste that can only be described as tasting like bug spray smells.  Honestly!  The lingering flavor in my mouth really reminded me of the smell of bug spray!  It was so foul that it gave me a sour stomach and made me nauseous for about an hour after trying it. If I could give this product a rating of zero stars I would.  Take it from me, do not believe what other reviewers have written, Teeccino tastes and smells nothing like coffee!  This has got to be the worst hot beverage that I have ever tasted!  I didn't even bother to return the Teeccino, I was so disgusted that I threw it out in order to prevent further damage to any of Amazon's other customers!

review/summary: Blah!!!
review/text: I love coffee but don't always need the caffeine so I thought I would try this "Herbal Coffee", well I just wasted my money because it's going to the trash.  I can't even think of anyone I dislike enough to gift it to.  Its got this strange flavor, like its sweetened with stevia(which I am not a fan of either), and it resembles the appearance of coffee, but the taste and smell is not even close.  Blah!!!
