review/summary: Picky eaters love Chef Michael's
review/text: My mother-in-law rescued an 11-year-old blind, underweight and obviously neglected full-blooded Collie named Solomon a few years back. Solly was a very sweet soul and loved to be pampered and praised, but he was an incredibly picky eater. It didn't help matters, considering her was incredibly thin. We started him on soft foods and slowly worked our way up. When we introduced hard dog food to him, he would not touch it. We kept on with the soft foods until finally, a friend of ours suggested Chef Michael's.<br /><br />The food looked like something I would eat for dinner and the smell was that of savory teriyaki beef jerky.<br /><br />Well, we placed the bowl of food in front of Solly, watching him closely. He suddenly sniffed the air and just as I thought he was going to turn away in disgust, he approached the bowl and sniffed some more. He licked the food. He took a bite! Success!<br /><br />Chef Michael's Filet Mignon was Solly's favorite meal after that. He started gaining more weight and was as healthy as he'd ever been.

review/summary: My dog seems to like it, but his tummy doesn't
review/text: The first time I fed this to my dog (mixed in with his other food), he quickly devoured it.  I thought, "Wow!  I've scored a homerun with this one!  He loves it!"  However, I have noticed since I started feeding it to him that it really upsets his stomach.  He doesn't get sick, per say, but his poor little tummy makes the strangest noises and he tries to eat grass the entire time we're outside on a walk.  When I feed him just his other food, he has no problem.  I won't be buying this food again.  One review said that it was like McDonald's for dogs-- I believe it.

review/summary: Yorkie loves the CHICKEN**
review/text: I will do a video review later,  if I can.  I have four dogs.  A Pom,  a Yorkie,  and their two puppies.  My Yorkie is the fussiest little thing ever,  as are most yorkies who are spoiled.  Sometimes if I had gotten them Beniful or or some other brand they would leave it there and it would sit for weeks and they wouldn't even touch it... just wait for a treat and basically starve themselves... but they love this brand.  They favor the chicken flavor though... but they like variety... so... I buy a big bag of chicken and a small bag of beef for if they ever seem a little bored.

review/summary: Please look past cute commercials
review/text: I've seen the commercial, some mystery chef cutting up chicken breast while his dog drools, then he sets down a bowl of kibble for him. Why not feed the actual meat? because there certainly isnt any in this food<br /><br />Keep in mind that when a fresh meat is listed on the ingredient label its not true. The manufacturer lists ingredients based on weight prior to extrusion(cooking), since meat is 80% water, once cooked, it goes way down the list. So you are primarily feeding a ton of soy mixed in with mystery meat and a bunch of other cheap ingredients leftover from human food production like byproducts, wheat and corn. Also soy is responsive for hormonal disruption, so you may want to read up on that.<br /><br />this food is cleverly marketed junk thats very low quality, you can check the unbiased review yourself on dog food advisor website.

review/text: Have an 11+ year old dash-mix with some missing teeth, a 6 year old tiny chihuahua, and a 5 year old dash-mix. These doggies are all jealous of what the other one is getting. So to find a dog food they all can eat together and not cause upset stomachs was a big deal.  They Love IT... I had been told in the past that my older dog had skin problems (he'd had other food at the time), in the last month he had a new physical and the Dr. told me his skin looked great.  They also did blood work on him and he is in very good health and weight so I am HAPPY too! If I was a dog, I would want my dog food to look like what the humans were eating too.

review/text: My Dogs are finicky eaters and I've gone through many different brands of dog food only to find the bowl still have food remaining. But I bought this dog food and the bowl is always empty. Not a single crumb is left behind. I've been feeding them this dog food for a couple years now. I mix in both the Chicken and Beef flavor for extra variety. There's no other dog food I'd buy but this one.

review/summary: Great quality for a great price
review/text: I bought this dogfood for my beagle boxer mix that has a very senitive stomach. Every food we gave her was just making her throw it up. We tried very expensive brands and not so expensive brands. We decided to try this brand by recommendation from a family member who feeds it to her dog. Since using this food, my dog no longer throws up, has a healthy coat, and is full of lots of energy. Its not crunchy, but it isnt messily soft either. It has the consistency of a chicken nugget. We have tried both variations and my dog loves them both. I love how it has real meat and vegetables. I Definitely recommend it to others!

review/text: What a treat for my little guys. They get excited every time I bring them a dish of Chef Michaels.  The love the dry meaty bits. They eat the meat with great enthusiasm, and leave the vegetables which they then finish up later.  They have been eating premium, ulta-premium dog food for years.  This costs a bit less, and as I have amazon Prime, it is delivered to my door without cost.<br />Small dogs ought to have their teeth brushed every day. Neither my dogs nor I can get with the program.  I did find a product at CVS called Dr. George's Plaque Blast for only $10, and it really seems to work.  It's much less "the fight is on" than tooth brushing. : )

review/summary: Gourmet Dog Meals for my Spoiled Dog!  The Best! - Filet Mignon and Chicken
review/text: RE: Gourmet Dog Meals for my Spoiled Dog!  The Best! - Both Filet Mignon and Chicken<br /><br />Do NOT let the 11.5 lb weight of this Great Michael Chef's Dog Meal fool you.<br />This is a GIGANTIC Bag compared to similar 10 to 12 pound bags.  This bag is big as a 25 to 30 LB bag that you would normally associate with dog foods.<br />I had thought the 11.5lb size would resemble and be similar to a Rice sized 12 lb bag, however measuring it comes to 17" x 24" !<br />That's basically the same size as my 30 lb bag of premium dog food from PelicanBay.<br />The meat chunks are fluffier (and apparently lighter in weight) and looks meatier and real to my dog [ even to me :) ]<br />You cannot beat the price and it's even cheaper with a monthly subscription obviously.<br />Hey, thanks Amazon, and it came in two days with my Amazon Prime in an even bigger box!  (Damn, I sound like an Amazon worker or something)<br />It's just a great and fast service for large purchases like these and more the reason why I made a good choice using this service.

review/text: My small Pomeranian loves this food!  She is a very picky eater, so I knew when she started chowing down on this food right away that she loved it.  The problem she has is that most dry dog foods have pieces too large and hard for her to chew.  I usually just end up buying puppy brands or straight wet food because of this.  The meat pieces are the perfect consistency for her and the smaller "harder" pieces aren't too large that she can't chew them.

review/summary: Dog food worth considering  - Please see my update
review/text: I decided to try Chef Michaels after years of Iams and then Iams and Kibbles N' Bits mixed. I recall thinking that my poor Beagle must be sick and tired of eating the same things for the past 6 years. Now if you know beagles, they are a highly food motivated breed and tend to pack on weight easily with those puppy dog eyes. Well, after many guilty years of people asking when Layla was going to be having her puppies, I decided to take a new approach. Hence Chef Michaels. If you haven't noticed, the bag only weighs about 4 pounds. This stands out to me because that indicates a lack of fillers to be filling up my Layla. Secondly, the first ingredient is a protein (meat) and not a insulin raising carbohydrate. She really likes both flavors and even eats the peas. (she never liked them before). I don't know how "healthy" this dog food is but based on it's density and primary ingredients I feel comfortable giving it to my dog. The large bag lasts us about 4 weeks??? We feed a 1/3 of a cup in the morning and 1/3 in the evening with a treat in the day of steamed sweet potato or banana slices (which she loves). I'm hoping that I'm not starving her because on the bag it recommends 1 1/2 to 2 cups for her 30lb. frame. She doesn't appear to have lost much weight but she likes the food a lot.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />Turns out Layla may be allergic to this. We are a week into a diet of exclusive Hill's Science Diet. She had been scratching and having skin irritation for quite a while now. The vet is trying to pin point the cause. She hasn't been itching at all this past week and we will slowly introduce foods back into her diet to see what the cause is. But only veggies and meat at some point.

review/text: Chef Michaels Purina Dry Dog food has been a lifesaver!! My West Highland Terrier is very picky about what she eats and I was at the end of my rope with what to feed her. She had been eating Science Diet small bites since we first got her at 10 weeks and just grew tired of it I guess, she is now almost 4 years old. I tried the Chef Michaels against my better judgement because it is a bit expensive but I am glad I did! Buying it in the 11.5 bag is more economical for me. I have only tried the Filet Mignon flavor...and my Westie loves it!!  Thanks Chef Michael!

review/summary: Best food ever!
review/text: I have an older Pomeranian with bad teeth, and she is THE pickiest eater you can find. If she doesn't like a food, she will starve herself for weeks and live off treats. She also gets diarrhea with almost every type of dog food, soft or dry. After putting this out for her, she gobbled it up and there was no stopping her. I thought that maybe she would spit out the dry/crunchy pieces like she normally does, but she ate those too just as well. I even mixed it up really well with her old dry dog food (Eukanuba), and she only ate the Chef's Michael tender & crunchy pieces and literally spit out anything that wasn't Chef's Michael. Best of all, no tummy upset or late-night awakenings to go potty! My dog just seems happier and I'm glad we tried it.

review/text: Though the ingredients seem to be decent with out corn being the first ingredient, this dog food has pieces of different texture and my dog would not eat the spongier, larger pieces.  The crunchier, smaller bits she ate just fine.  Unfortunately that is enough for me not to buy it again as there is too much waste for my dog.  I am seeing a tendency for other dog foods to do the same with the spongy pieces so that is something I have to consider.  My dog is a country dog who seldom receives soft foods so maybe this has something to do with it.

review/text: I have a relatively picky poodle.  (Yes, even the big ones can been finicky!!)  However, she loves this dog food.  I thought that I was going to be doomed to stinky, high end canned foods for her.  The truth is, she likes this dog food so well that I can even use it for treats and training.  It actually looks like chicken chunks or beef chunks (we mix them).  The ingredients list is impressive.  I feel good that I'm giving her something of high quality that will meet her nutritional needs.<br /><br />This food has been so successful for us that we have put it on auto re-order.  This means that I don't have to go to the feed store and drag home a 30 pound bag of something that she probably wouldn't eat any way.  It is delivered right to the door.<br /><br />I highly recommend this food.

review/text: You have so many different places were you store items to be delivered, right?  So if I live in Florida, why do you send me FOOD from as far as Illinois?  And what is worst, why does the bag look like if a stampede of horses ran over it.  We are talking about food for our pets. They are as important for most us as any other family member, so why do you have a delivery policy that is simply outrageous???????<br /><br />Also, the bag seemed as if it was already returned by one or maybe more customers. And once opened it was mostly crumbs, not food as advertised!!!!!!!!!!!  I honestly feel that we customers deserve a better treatment from business like yours that are sometimes desperate to keep us as their customers.<br /><br />Keep this attitude and slowly you will lose us as such.

review/text: 1 of my 2 dogs was diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease. Part of the treatment is a change to a diet with a different, non meat, non poultry protein source. In addition to a main diet change snacks like beggin' strips and milk bones had to go. But the dogs enjoy these just as well. They are pricey but I supplement with easily digestible homemade snacks like potato puffs and sweet potato fries. Seems to be working because his appetite is improving.

review/summary: My favorite gluten free pasta!
review/text: I have celiac disease, but no one else in my house does. So I need pasta that everyone will like, especially my kids. I tried all the brands, but Tinkyada is the best. Every variety of their pasta is great. It doesn't get over-cooked and mushy. It doesn't stick together, like SO many other brands of gluten free pasta tend to do. Plus, it comes in really healthy varieties, and lots of different shapes. Buying it in bulk is a great savings, too, especially if you have Amazon Prime. It's one of those things that I can make, and no one knows that they're getting something gluten free, so I can feel like everyone else in that little way, which is nice.

review/text: I think the ratings for Mori-Nu Tofu would not be so high if more people were actually aware of what's in it. Mori-Nu's tofu contains soy protein isolate, a highly processed form of soy. As a busy student cooking for myself most nights, I'm always looking for grocery products that will make putting dinner on the table more convenient. But while I was intrigued by the shelf-stability of Mori-Nu Tofu, I'm definitely not counting on it as a staple-- Tofu is considered healthy because it is a fermented soy product, but the soy protein isolate in Mori-Nu's tofu puts it in the category of processed soy, the kind that will mess with your endocrine system if consumed it regularly. This means if you're eating tofu for the health benefits, you may as well look elsewhere. What I've learned is that most tofus packed in water have expiry dates two months ahead (unopened) so you'll only need to replenish your supply every 1 1/2-2 months. Sure, this would save me space in the fridge and I could stock up on a year's worth of tofu if I really wanted to (and I might want to, but a year's worth of tofu is hardly a necessity). But the bottom line is I'm just unwilling to make this highly processed food a staple, particularly when versions that are truly healthy are readily available.

Now I can make cookies and supper without delay or a trip to the store (or another store). For sweets, I substitue tofu for eggs and applesauce for butter. I use tofu in Hamburger Helper dishes, it blends well with the sauce and spice. Firm tofu is excellent in stir fry especially with a flavored marinade, which doesn't have to be high sodium soy sauce.

review/text: Like some other reviewers, I was skeptical, but ordered based on the reviews here. I was even more skeptical when I opened the box and saw that it was "lite" tofu (I still don't know what that means, exactly). The stuff even looks bad as you slide it out of the box.<br /><br />However, it is a fantastic tofu product. It is smoother than any tofu I've bought from the grocery store, and I have used it in soups, stir fry, wraps, and plain. This will be the only tofu I buy from now on. If you like silky tofu, you will like this product.<br /><br />In addition to being awesomely tasty, it keeps unrefrigerated in my pantry. From experience, I know it keeps at least five days in the fridge once opened.

review/summary: I LOVE this stuff!; I'm a convert.
review/text: At first I was highly skeptical.  I mean, come on.  Tofu in a box?!?  It must be loaded with tons of preservatives, etc.  However, my roommate swears by the stuff.  After seeing my roommate using it in a variety of ways, I was curious, and finally one day, I picked up a box.<br /><br />I can't believe it's preservative-free!  And it tastes great!  (or more exact, it has no taste --par for course for tofu).  The texture is just like the regular silken stuff.<br /><br />Also, I'm full after consuming a box of tofu (female, 140 lbs), which is only 120 calories!!!  Good for weight loss/control.<br /><br />Ordering the case is super-convenient.  I order it to my office and keep a bottle of ponzu sauce (soy sauce with citrus lemon) at the office.  When I want a quick lunch or pick-me-up snack, I just make myself one that is healthy.<br /><br />The product is also very versatile.  Similar to my roommate, I use it in tofu scrambles (tofu instead of eggs), tofu shakes (fruit, juice, tofu), and miso soup (by the miso base from Japanese or Korean market from the fridge section, comes in 4"x4" cube container..only scoop out what you need and refrigerate the rest).  There is also tons of books out there on how to innovatively use tofu (has tons of non-Asian recipes).<br /><br />bon apetit!

review/summary: Lite Morinu Tofu
review/text: I eat tofu almost every day to help a digestive condition, so this is a great way to order it in bulk. This particular sub-brand is lower calorie than most tofus, comes in a shelf stable package, and generally remains intact in its rectangle shape outside the packaging for slicing or cubing. it is more gel-like than some full calorie tofus I've had, so it's rather bland to eat plain. Nonetheless, it blends well with spices and sauces. I normally steam it. Due to its gel-like structure, I don't think it would hold up well in frying.

review/text: I can't buy tofu locally so I buy this shelf stable kind from Amazon in 12-pack cases.  I have a good time experimenting with the tofu and my smallish food processor making dips and dressings.  When I want to use the tofu as a meat-like additive to recipes I press the excess water out by placing the cake of tofu in a small glass casserole, covering with cling wrap, and putting something heavy on it in the 'fridge overnight.  Next day a lot of the water has been pressed out of the tofu and the results are a denser product.  Don't know what I'd do without tofu and Amazon!

review/text: I know many people do not like this paper packed tofu... I actually do not like it when it's straight out of the carton.<br /><br />This guy does not have a texture, although it is "firm" and has a wierd smell when it's uncooked. It needs to be cooked into something else, like smoothies or dips or like the lazagna recipe on the back.<br /><br />Once that's done, this is a pretty good dairy substitute in a sweet deal (with free shipping!!!)

review/summary: Decent Tofu, but store-bought is comparable...
review/text: In the last few years I've started eating tofu more frequently. Most of the time I just fry it up in a pan with some Italian seasoning, black pepper and (once golden brown) a sprinkling of soy sauce. I like it with rice or in a soup/dal, and it makes for a quick, hearty meal.<br /><br />The tofu I usually buy is from the grocery store, that cheap stuff that comes in little plastic boxes. Buying the Mori-Nu pack seemed like a good deal, but to be honest, it's a little disappointing. It's supposed to keep outside of the fridge, but the boxes still "sweat" a bit and what's inside probably suffers due to that. The tofu itself seems "limp" and "lifeless" out of the package; I know it's the silken type, but I'm used to having a nice block I can cut into cubes or chop up with a spatula (while in the pan). This is more like runny eggs that barely firm up after ten minutes in the pan. The liquid it comes in takes a while to evaporate too, where the store-bought cubes can be smashed beforehand to release most of the water. The end taste is pretty good, but you only get around 50-75% off what's in the supermarket packages, so it's not worth the effort.

review/summary: Mori-Nu Tofu is the "Rite Lite"
review/text: I used to buy silken tofu in the local grocery stores, but I can't find it anymore so I turned to Amazon.com. I practice the Eat Right For Your Type eating program and as blood type A, a vegetarian or semi-vegetarian food program is the best for my health. Mori Nu Lite Silken Firm Tofu fits right in. My two sons are also blood type As and enjoy tofu as much as I do. I use it to make tofu balls, tofu nuggets, smoothies, tofu veggie scrambles, baked tofu, fried tofu,salad dressing,sauces...I especially like that I can order twelve at once so I don't run out. Having a product like this<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKTY7Y">Mori-Nu Tofu, Lite, Silken, Firm, 12.3-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>is so conventient. I just take a box and make dinner or breakfast with it and whatever else I have on hand. Thanks so much for being a part of our healthy lifestyle journey!

review/text: This tea is excellent!  I would recommend it to any green tea lover.  I've been drinking 3-4 cups a day of green tea for its anti-inflammatory properties and this particular flavor is now my favorite.  I bought a package of six boxes from Amazon for only $14.7 in September (with two-day Prime delivery included).  Unfortunately, at its current price is just too expensive -- you can get it for less in your grocery story.  I got it yesterday at Publix for $2.39 a box.  Check the Salada website to see which grocery stores carry this flavor in your area.

review/summary: Pacific Natural Foods: Poblano Pepper and Corn Chowder
review/text: Wow, this was surprisingly good.  I didn't hold much hope for it since it came from a box, but figured it would be good in a pinch if I forgot to pack my lunch.  And I'm glad I forgot to pack my lunch today and had this as an emergency backup, this is worthy of an occasional meal.<br /><br />Since this is vegetarian it has to rely on the spices and vegetables that make it up.  In this case corn and potatoes were the main vegetables, but there were some peppers and onion as well.  They were cut in small pieces, which I like as they fit on the spoon and in my mouth, and while there weren't a ton of them, it was still enough to make me feel like I was getting my monies worth.  The spices were really good as well, it was kind of spicy, but there was a touch of garlic and pepper that I could tell in it.  And it was nicely salted, but not too salty as a lot of soups seem to be.  I could taste the cream and at times it even tasted a little cheesy to me.  Which is great because I love cheese (although there is actually no cheese in this soup).<br /><br />The ingredients were great for a soup.  All pronounceable and it was just the vegetables, water, cream, and the spices.  No weird chemicals at all.  Corn was the predominant vegetable, but there was still a good amount of potato in there too.  The whole box is actually two servings, at 190 calories a serving.  I went ahead and ate the whole thing for lunch, but if you have a refrigerator nearby, the top of the container can be sealed up to save the other serving for another time.  Although it should be noted that the container is not microwavable.  The fat was high on this soup, 10 grams a serving, but at least it's probably healthy fat.  Sodium is also high at 700mg a serving, but as said before, it didn't really taste that salty.  There's even a few vitamins like calcium and Vitamin A in this meal too.<br /><br />I will definitely be getting this again and am eager to try out some of the other flavors by Pacific Natural.  It was a nice way to spend lunch.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/summary: Tasty, Healthy and Convenient!
review/text: Recently, because of dh's health concerns, I've had to start preparing organic mostly vegetarian type meals. This has been challenging because those refrigerated and frozen processed foods we've relied on for lunches and snacks are no longer an option for us. I prepare mostly homemade meals, but for weekend lunches it's nice to have ready to cook convenience type meals. Browsing the health food section of our local grocer, I saw this soup on sale and purchased it along with another soup by Pacific Natural Foods. My husband, who despises most soups, and I really enjoyed the flavor of this one and it's comforting to know that all of the ingredients are certified organic. Now, I will be looking at the other offerings by this company.

review/text: All things considered, warheads and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LA9UF0">Toxic Waste</a> are one of my addictions. Sour stuff is my munchie of choice! Also probably a good part of why I have an ulcer right now, but that is neither here nor there.<br /><br />Still, to all persons considering ordering these products over the internet: be conscious of the weather between California and your destination. Especially in summer. Warheads tend to stick to the packaging when they melt in place in the back of a mail-hauler semi-truck. Makes them devilish to unwrap, and you sometimes get bits of foil or plastic wrap stuck to them.<br /><br />I repeat, no fault of the reseller here. Good product, but my FUBAR in ordering it at a time when there was 90-degree-plus weather between shipping locale and my home.<br /><br />I shall be ordering this again, but here around October when it isn't so bloody hot.

review/summary: Not as fizzy as the smaller bottles, or the glass bottles
review/text: I'm pretty much addicted to sparkling water. Perrier is my favorite because it has the highest fizz quotient. It is super bubbly compared to the other brands.<br /><br />However, for some reason the water in these 33 oz plastic bottles is only fizz-lite. I noticed that the caps don't seem to be on quite as tightly as the caps on the smaller bottles or on the glass bottles, so perhaps this is why. The other option is perhaps these just don't travel well and lose their fizz on the delivery truck. Either way, I cannot recommend the 33 oz plastic bottles of Perrier because they're missing their most vital, super fizz.<br /><br />The big glass ones are fine. We've bought those locally with no problems, and we buy the smaller bottles both locally and here on Amazon and they're all super-fizz. So if you're like me and want extra-fizzy, go with an alternate option rather than these 33 oz bottles.<br /><br />Summary: Not up to usual fizz levels, buy the little bottles or glass bottles instead.

review/summary: Weird bubbles
review/text: I purchased these a few months ago and while the packaging was excellent and the beans came in a timely manner, I've noticed something strange. When I rinse these beans off, there is a chlorine-ish smell and soaplike bubbles are created on top of the rinsing water. These bubbles are easy to skim off but I'm left wondering where these bubbles are coming from. After two or three rinsing the bubbles stop. The milk resulting from these beans tastes excellent, I'm just a little concerned what these bubbles could be and what residues are on the beans.

review/text: If you love French roast coffee, then you may like Hula Girl more than I did. My position is that if you want a single region coffee, and are willing to pay a bit more, you should have a roast that lets the unique quality of the bean shine, not one that buries it in the aroma of charcoal. This really could be any bean, as far as flavor goes once the coal black roast is finished. Buy a French roast or a Sumatra and save yourself a couple bucks.
