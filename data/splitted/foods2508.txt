review/text: I love a cup of bold black tea to start off my day.  Twinings English Breakfast K-cups fit that bill perfectly.  They are stronger than traditional tea bags and have a nice bold flavor.

review/text: I just recently bought a Keurig B70 single serving size coffee maker.  Actually you can make coffee, tea, and cocoa.  And you can even buy this italian lemon drink.<br /><br />It is wonderful.  A great cup of tea every time.  I'm not a coffee drinker so haven't tried the coffee.<br /><br />I have almost finished off a 25 pack of the Twinings English Breakfast Decaf tea.  It has the same taste as the non-decaf tea and it tastes great.

review/text: I'm into flavor and have no interest in the art and ritual of tea making.  This is good tasting tea and can handle milk or cream, I guess that's the point with breakfast teas.  If High Tea is your thing then I'm sure the Keurig is a big turnoff.  However for me, the Keurig can make a cup of coffee, a cup of decaf and a cup of tea in under three minutes.  Great for a crowd.

review/summary: An excellent cup of tea.
review/text: The Twinings English Breakfast Tea does indeed brew quite the perfect cup of tea.  I have personally used the K Cups in both the basic Keurig brewer and the commercial variety, without much difference in taste and temperature.  I have tried other brands of tea in K Cup form, but the Twinings is consistently my favorite.  Buying them in this large set is good for someone that knows what you are already getting, or has potentially enjoyed this tea via other forms.

review/text: I find the taste to be odd or off. It isn't bitter, but it's some of the worst tea I've had and definitely the worst K-cup. It isn't completely undrinkable, but it's pretty close, and I'm not a tea snob by any means. There are a lot of good reviews, so maybe I got a bad batch. Who knows? But I think I'll stick to brewing my tea the old-fashioned way.

review/summary: Tea + K cups don't mix
review/text: I love Twinings tea, so my brother surprised me the last time I visited him by buying a box. I had a hard time getting through it, as it just doesn't compare to Twinings tea in a tea bag. I like strong tea (with milk) and the K cups just don't have the same amount of flavor. I kept thinking, "How hard is it to pour boiling water over a tea bag? Why do I need a K cup to make tea?" I appreciated my brother's thoughtful gift, but can't recommend making ANY tea with a cup machine.

review/text: We enjoy our Keurig for coffee but tea leaves (sorry) a bit to be desired. Somehow the taste provided by the steeping process outweighs the expensive convenience of the K-Cups. For those of a like mind, we would suggest the following.<br /><br />Buy your tea loose. You will probably save money, can control the quantity per serving and will end up with better quality.<br />Loose tea is available from Amazon.<br /><br />Purchase a Adagio Teas Ingenuitea Teapot thru Amazon. Efficient and brews a good 16 oz. cup of tea. For a few dollars more they have a 32 oz.<br /><br />Add a bit of tea to the teapot, place the teapot on your Keurig and fill with hot water.<br /><br />Wait the appropriate steeping time and your tea is ready.<br /><br />For those who would like a warmed cup to pour into. Fill the cup with a bit of hot water from the Keurig and let it warm while the tea steeps.

review/text: While I like the Twinings bag tea, I found this product to be weak, watery, and downright nasty with a plastic aftertaste. Perhaps part of the problem is that the K-cup system does not allow for proper steeping time (5 minutes for a good strong cuppa').  Putting it in the K-cup is a waste of good tea.

Better than Twinnings tea bags, and probably better than loose tea (at least, with *my* skill at making tea.)

She's always loved English Breakfast and Twinings E.B.K-cup has now replaced her tea bag standard.  She's currently drinking Grace Rare Tea's Lemon Verbena (in a can with what looks like dried from the tree tea leaves) and makes it with the Keurig's hot water only feature.  Tea steeps for five minutes or so and results are also excellent.

This tea is a great tea for breakfast or any time of the day.

review/summary: Tea-like beverage emerges - and my boys love it...
review/text: Simply NOT the same quality tea one gets from a pot - you know: boiling water, leaves (even bags), ceramic pot, 5 minutes of steeping...  My boys like being able to make their own tea so convenience trumps quality.  Love the Keurig coffees so wanted to try the tea.  It is resoundingly OK - no more, no less.  As of January, 2010, it has become a staple - via Amazon Subscription, it's pretty reaasonable and all others in the family like the convenience.  I stick with my PG Tips and a pot for that wonderful British truck stop tea flavor (or is it "flavour"?).

review/summary: Packaging creates terrible tea leaf mess
review/text: Every single K-cup I put in breaks open during brewing.  I always end up with a horrible tea leaf mess which has to be strained if I want to drink it and the machine has to be cleaned after every single one.  It's like the heat or something makes the covering over the top separate around the circle from the cup.  I thought at first maybe it was the machine, but my husband's (Scott) several different varieties of coffee never do this and then I thought "well, maybe it's just the one odd box so I'll stick with it til next order." 5 orders later it's no different.  Whoever packages these Kcups (is it really Twinings?) has an awful manufacturing process.  Do not buy these unless you want a goopey tea-leaf-grounds mess everywhere.

review/summary: Expensive but convenient although a little weak
review/text: Well, I was a little disappointed in these Twinings K-cups.  The reason being that while waiting for these guys to come in the mail I tried some normal Twinings english breakfast teabags beforehand.  The K-Cups still brew a decent cup of tea, although as you cannot control the steepage the tea comes out on the weak side for me.  While still tasty, the much greater expense ($0.45/cup vs less than half that for teabags) for the convenience may not add up for a lot of people. However, if you're go-go-go in the morning and don't have time it may be worthwhile.  I myself will be going back to teabags but will still use the Keurig to get fast hot water!  Best of both worlds!

review/summary: Every morning
review/text: I drink a cup of this every morning, with milk added.  It's just wonderful.  I do usually have a few tea leaf specs either floating around the top or sunk to the bottom, but it's not so many that it bothers me.  I just don't drink the last little sip.  I give this tea 5 stars regardless of the tea leaf specs, because I find this happens often in other k-cups and regular tea bags, too.  I don't really think it's their fault.<br />It's strong enough to brew a flavorful cup on the largest setting, but it's not too strong when put on the smaller settings, either.

review/text: Having received a Keurig for Christmas, I was looking for a good "black tea".  I'm puzzled because these K-cups got high marks from other reviewers.  I ordered the minimum 2 boxes from Amazon Grocery and find the brewed tea to be rather bitter.  I have to wonder if Amazon Grocery stored the product too long, or perhaps at too high a temperature.<br />I'm going to attempt to return this product because it's just not very good.

We bought a box of this tea a while back and it is still sitting in the cuppboard, missing maybe 4 at the most.  I like English Breakfast tea and drink it by the bags but these cups are horrible.<br /><br />If you have the K-filter you can brew certain loose tea in it.  My wife uses it all the time and it comes out pretty good.  There are decent teas available through k-cups, this is not one of them.

review/summary: A nice pick me up and throat soother!
review/text: There are so many benefits to ginger that I don't know where to start!  I had a bit of a sore throat due to a lot of singing I've been doing with the band.  I opened this matcha and absorbed the spicy scent and put it into a tin to keep it fresh.  The small size fits perfect in the tin with a little wiggle room...enough to be able to get the measuring spoon in.  I had been saving this matcha for the perfect time and after a day of singing I needed to bring it out.  Not to mention the fact that I could use a bit of a pick me up.<br />I decided to prepare this matcha hot first since I wanted to sooth my throat.  I added just a pinch of sugar and a generous helping of honey (I love my honey)!  I did take a sip before adding the honey just so I could get the original flavor.  This matcha is very smooth and spicy.  It is not in your face spicy, but just enough to give it a little flavor.<br />This matcha was very soothing on my throat so I think I'm going to save this one for next week when I have to sing again.  Sorry friends, no sharing of this one!<br />Red Leaf Tea mentions this for treating motion sickness when suffering from an unsettling stomach among other things so it's definitely useful for everyday use.  Think I might have to save a bit for my hubby to try.<br /> Here is how I ordered my Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea:<br />Size: Small<br />Quality: Classic Starter Grade<br />Flavor: Delicate<br />Storage: Air tight refill flat pouch - would definitely recommend purchasing a tin for your matcha to keep it fresh.  I did not order one this time since I already had a tin.<br />To get your own tasty Ginger Matcha from Red Leaf Tea - GO HERE NOW!!!!<br />[...]<br />A sore throat soother!

review/summary: awesome.... from ONE fulfillment warehouse
review/text: The first container I purchased was excellent quality so I purchased a second and then a third.  Unlike the first and second the third was shipped by UPS and was mildly dented, but that is not a concern for *this* type of product.  The third canister contained soggy-ish "dried" ginger with a disturbingly high frequency of dark spotting on the ginger slices.  Before discovering the less than awesome quality of the third container I had already purchased two more containers.  I am hoping five and six will be the fame FANTASTIC QUALITY of container one!<br /><br />(will edit when I find the locations of the two respective fulfillment warehouses)<br /><br />Be aware that the canisters reveal their origin: CHINA.  This information was not on the amazon product page at time of purchase :(  I hope my ginger is not seasoned with lead.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Canister five was severely damaged in shipping thanks to change for the worse in amazon shipping policy.  The giner in canister five was exposed to air.  As a food product I insisted on replacement.  Eventually after shaming amazon via [...]they condescended to ship a replacement.  The replacement canister was cosmetically damaged but air tight.  Canister six was similarly dented but air tight.  Canister six ginger had a higher "thread count".<br /><br />_beware_<br /><br />Amazon seems to have a policy of not-bothering to include sufficient padding according to UPS/FedEx guidelines. Their bean counters hope the customer will absorb losses from goods damaged in shipping. I insist my new items arrive in new condition: padding on ALL SIX box surfaces.

review/summary: great price point
review/text: GOOD POINTS:<br /> - great pricing (I got the Roland sale + subscription discounts)<br /> - well packed (heavy plastic bag inside thin metal "paint can"-like tin<br /> - fresh & tender<br /><br />AMBIVALENT ISSUES:<br /> - the label says, "baby ginger", which I find hard to believe. First, the ginger has quite a lot of heat when eaten on its own. [It's now 1/2 hour after eating one slice with millky tea; my mouth still feels the heat and I am NOT sensitive to spice.] Second, about 20% is moderately to extremely fibrous. Third, the slices are medium to large, which would be alright if lengthwise, but one can see that they are crosswise (large rhizomes). None of these are qualities I associate with baby ginger. The reason I'm "ambivalent" is that while I think the label is incorrect, the Amazon product description does not include this, so it wasn't a factor in my purchase.<br /> - the sugar used is much coarser than usual (about 3-4x the size of US white sugar). The Australian and US candied ginger I've enjoyed in the past used extra fine sugar (US "baking sugar"). My issue is that the coarser sugar doesn't cling and make a crust to protect the ginger, the way extra fine does. Also, about 1/3 of the pieces have unsightly clumps of sugar on them, which I remove before serving or using for baking.<br /><br />NEGATIVE:<br />- the fiber issue mentioned above is something I never encountered with Australian or US candied ginger. Unpleasant to eat and embarrassing for the hostess. Also slows down baking prep.<br />- the big crystals are mostly an esthetic issue, but there is the safety issue of one's blade catching on a crystal and the blade bouncing a little as the sugar shatters. Still trying to find a work-around for chopping and mincing.<br />- The "paint can" is difficult to work with. Obviously, I can remove some ginger and finesse the rest of the bag out of the can, to store as I like; but this is a 6 lb quantity packed in a resealable container: the container should be easy to re-seal and re-open. This container needs a tool to be opened; and each use renders the container harder to use--the thin metal dents and bents, so the lid is more and more misshapened. Actually, I'd prefer the packer please just seal the very sturdy plastic bag, label it for sale, and pass the savings on to the consumer.<br /><br />TO SUM UP:<br />A generally good product with great price point, but you have to invest considerable effort to get the best results. (Unless you don't mind a bunch of spiky slivers in your mouth, or your knife slipping again & again.)<br /><br />I love candied ginger as a snack, as a baking ingredient and as a "food pharmaceutical", so I'll be purchasing again. If this were a seasonal purchase (e.g., just for holiday baking), I'd pass and look for an easier-to-use product with more consistent quality.

While the former poster looked up China, Ginger, lead - that is not the issue with foodstuffs from China - they have all kinds of quality issues and other forms of chemicals getting in their foodstuffs - from where it is grown and what it is fertilized with to where and how it is processed. I don't put anything on or in my body that came from China. It's hard not to buy consumer products from electronics to kitchen gadgets not bought in China, but I try very hard not to eat anything that comes from there.

review/text: Roland Ginger Slices are a wonderful value.  They are packaged in a beautiful 6 pound can for maximum freshness.  Because of the packaging they arrive soft and moist.  A little sweeter than some dried ginger, these slices are good to snack on and good to mince into things....I like little bits minced into green salads

review/summary: Roland Sliced Crystallized Ginger, 6-Pound Can
review/text: Very good quality ginger at the best price I have found anywhere.  This product is imported from China and apparently has no preservatives in it.  Communication with the Roland company was poor, however.  They were very slow to reply to my request to confirm that there were no preservatives in this product.  When they did respond, they did so in an unprofessional manner and did not fully answer my questions.  I had to contact them three times for an accurate response to my questions and the tone of their emails was not friendly.  However, considering the excellent quality of this product and the exceptional price, I would purchase again.

review/text: Product arrived quickly, and is fresh and tasty. I looked up lead, Ginger, China, and did not see any cause for concern. I think the China-lead thing has to do with paints, varnishes, etc. I bought my first big can for work and nibble a couple ounces each day. I am here right now buying another can for my wife and I to share at home. My internet research suggests that the health benefits of the ginger far outweigh the small amount of sugar it is cured in. Check this out, and then use the same tool to see what half a teaspoon of sugar looks like:  [...]

review/text: Last month I noticed this candy for the 1st time in my local Target and bought a box for my BF's Xmas stocking.  After he had opened it, we were both very sorry I hadn't bought more.  The combination sounds weird, but it works.  The traditional chocolate mint combo made by this company is too strong, but this was perfect.  The mint was very faint and just blended nicely with the raspberry and chocolate.  So good I returned to Target the day after Xmas for more.  Unfortunately, there was no more to be had.<br /><br />I was happy to find it for sale on Amazon, however, the boxes (at least from this vendor) are both more expensive and smaller.  Won't order it again.

review/text: I recently became a vegetarian, saying bye to meat was not hard as I barely ate any before, but saying goodbye to cheese products that contain rennet and other things like sweets with gelatin was HARD! my resolve would almost falter everytime I went through the cookies and candy isle. one of my friends told me about Annie's cheddar bunnies (I used to eat goldfish like crazy)and their fruit snacks (gummies without gelatin) I found them easily enough at Whole foods and other natural markets by my house and even though I usually pay 4.00 dollars a box, they are sooooo worth it! the taste is amazing, they use non-animal enzymes!!! and best of all they are non- gmo! (I am trying to eat only non-gmo foods) I tell you the box doesn't even last the day, and as long as the company will continue using non-gmo ingredients and non animal enzymes they will continue to have my support.

review/text: "...made without hydrogenated oils - which is a good thing since it's difficult for our bodies to absorb trans-fatty acids that come from hydrogenated oils." ~box<br /><br />These are definitely natural snack crackers to bounce around about. I mean, it is so rare to find even natural foods without hydrogenated oils. I can't count the times I've read labels only to be disappointed to find that "natural" does not always mean healthy.<br /><br />Ingredients: Certified organic wheat flour, expeller pressed safflower oil, aged cheddar cheese (contains milk, salt, enzymes, cheese culture), salt, yeast extract, paprika, annatto extract (for color), ground celery seed, onion powder, yeast.<br /><br />I've made my own cheese crackers and these really do taste homemade. About 24 tiny crackers will satisfy any cheese cracker craving and that is about 70 calories.<br /><br />These crackers are Bernie the Bunny (Annie's beloved mascot) approved. They are also made with only vegetarian ingredients. Each cracker is the cutest bunny shape.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Authentic Jamaica - Good with Red Stripe Beer
review/text: On our first trip to Jamaica in 1985, our whole family fell in love with Jerk Chicken and Jerk Pork from the street-side shops throughout Jamaica.  We brought back 5 brands of this stuff in our suitcases from grocery stores on that trip.  I think Walkers Wood was one of the brands.  In any case Walkers Wood is great and is now on the menu in the households of my 4 adult children. We use it at least once a week on our gas or charcoal grill year around.<br /><br />My Chicken 'Recipe'<br />Use a whole cutup chicken or equivelent package of chicken wings or chicken drummies.  Coat with about 2 heaping tablespoons of this sauce. If you have the time, let it marinade for a while.  Put on indirect heat on the grill for 1 hour+ for a whole cut-up chicken or 50 minutes for wings.  Turn over once during cooking.  Adjust the time for the temperature.  The built-in thermometer on my Weber gas grill runs at about 375-400 degrees when it is turned to about 20%.<br /><br />Dark Golden Brown . . . The Jerk Sauce darkens more than just plain chicken.  Indirect grill until deep golden brown.<br /><br />Slow grilling can chemically burn off the 'heat' in peppers. Depending on the audience, we sometimes add a little Tobasco Sauce to the Jerk Sauce to reinforce the pepper.  Some of the best Jerk Chicken & Pork vendors in Kingston serve jerk that is HOT! . . but nothing a couple of Red Stripe beers or coka-colas for kids can't fix.<br /><br />Other Vendors in Negril and Ocho Rios tame the heat but still have the spicy and lime flavors.<br /><br />If you want to complete the Jamaica experience serve with Fried Rice and Peas.  Prepare some white rice, add some chicken bouillon and 1 finely diced Serrano pepper, then finish in a fying pan with a little oil and green peas.

review/text: The flavor of this Walkerswood Jamaican Jerk Seasoning Sauce brings a little bit of Jamaica into your backyard grilling. This stuff is fantastic on slow grilled chicken or pork and definately gets very close to the taste I remember of my first Jerk pork from the wayside stand on the bus ride to Ocho Rios. The only problem was weak shipping materials that allowed one of my 6 bottles to break. The company was quick to refund me the cost of that bottle and the shipping, so all is well. I will buy this again.

review/text: Bust out the napkins, grab yourself a beer, and buckle your seat belts cause this stuff is a proper<br />authentic flamefest of Jamaican jerk heat. You can put it on straight, or cut it with a little olive<br />oil, but I've found it best to marinate chicken or pork tenderloins for at least 24 hours before cooking for optimum results.<br /><br />Its a little messy cause you really have to rub this stuff in and make sure you turn/shake your marinade bag every few hour to ensure an even distribution of this wondermous stuff. If you're not using rubber gloves, make sure you wash your hands and I wouldn't plan on rubbing your eyes or doing anything else to sensitive body parts for a while. haw haw<br /><br />This stuff is the best, followed closely by Grace Jerk Seasoning, but Walkerswood doesn't turn your chicken green like the Grace rub does. 5 Pods

review/text: I wanted HOT jerk seasoning and I got HOT.  I ordered a case and I love it.  It is great on beef, but too hot for chicken.  I mix some with olive oil and marinate burgers for the evening.  The next day, the burgers go onto the grill and I cannot get enough.  My kids love it, you get a little sting (read - heat) and the flavor is fantastic.  This stuff gets a 10 out of 10.  If you're not into HOT, buy something else.  The HOT is flavorful, depending on your sensitivity, it can border on painful.  I'd suggest a taste first, then you'll be hooked...

review/text: Many years ago, a friend went to Jamaica and brought me a bottle of this stuff as a gift.  I have been buying it online ever since.  No other jerk sauce that I have tasted even comes close.  I also use it to mix with other hot sauces to add some spice and flavor.  There are few things things that you will ever taste that have so much flavor, but be warned, that it is spicy - much more than, for example, Frank's RedHot or McIlhenny's Tabasco sauce.  If you are not one to enjoy and handle spicy food, then you will probably not like it.  If you love a lot of flavor and some good heat, then give it a try!

review/text: My husband and I had been to Jamaica 20 years ago and discovered Walkerswood, so when we went back 5 years later, we decided to buy a case, giving some away for gifts. We weren't concerned since they had a distributer in the US. We haven't been back to Jamaica since, but were saddened to find out that this product was no longer being distributed from their US plant, the phone number was disconnected.  Needless to say, we were thrilled to find it again.  We were a little skeptical to buy a case, since the packaging changed slighly, so we only bought 6 jars.  Anyhow, we are thrilled, it is the same stuff. YEAH!!!!! Thank you for bringing our little piece of Jamaica back.
