review/summary: Grill the chicken first!
review/text: These spice packets are pretty much perfect.<br /><br />I recommend starting with a whole chicken or skin-on pieces, grill quickly over high heat to char the skin somewhat and give the chicken a smoky flavor. If using whole chicken, cut it up into large-ish pieces and throw into a crock pot along with butter, tomatoes, potatoes, diced onion, and some other veggies.<br /><br />The smokiness of the chicken and the awesome spices make a perfect match. You can take the skin off prior to serving, but leaving it on during cooking makes the sauce taste just that much better.<br /><br />Like pretty much everyone else said - this is 'shortcut' Nirvana.<br /><br />Enjoy, my Amazononian friends!

review/text: This is easy, tastes great, and anyone else will think you did a lot of prep. And I cook a lot of Indian from scratch.The paste contains all the spices, just add chicken, butter, and water.  It's a bit salty so it tastes best when made with unsalted butter. Try it.

review/text: This is one of the best Butter Chicken sauces I have ever tried.  It is slightly spicier than I prefer so I actually add an extra 1/2 cup of coconut cream to it.

review/summary: Delicious BASE, a little spicy, great w Rice
review/text: This was so easy to prepare!  The only thing that made the meal preparation take a while is thawing the chicken x_x  One bag's worth of stew, with chicken added, WITH RICE was a satisfying meal for two. I made a side salad too and that really sealed the deal.  Very delicious! But probably not the healthiest.<br />Also since the stew was quite spicy, I added extra water to tone it down a little (was still excellent after!) yet still, both time I prepared it I wished I had made extra rice.<br /><br />I will definitely try other kitchen of india curries now :-)

review/summary: Quick Fix for Indian ... Even better than going out!
review/text: We purchased the Butter Chicken Curry packs when Amazon had a great sale and were skeptical on the taste.  Low and behold, the taste way exceeded our expectations! We are not meat eaters, so we added tofu and cauliflower (instead of chicken) and were impressed with how authentic the taste was compared to restaurants we've been to.  Nothing beats fresh but this unassuming packet of goodness could rival some of the indian restaurants we frequent! Perfect meal in taste and price!!!

review/text: Butter chicken is one of my favorite Indian dishes. This little spice pouch greatly exceeded my expectations by making it easy to make a very flavorful rendition of it using only one pot.<br /><br />1 cup of water, 3 tablespoons butter (I used Smart Balance and it came out great), a pound of chicken (the bagged frozen Tyson grilled chicken strips work great) and 20 minutes and you have a dish that closely approximates the restaurant version. I added some slices of Vidalia onion at the very end so they'd stay crunchy.<br /><br />Great product, great value. [...]

review/summary: Choosy Indians Choose KOI
review/text: I didn't think that this Butter Chicken Curry paste would hold up to a traditional, home cooked Indian meal...but I was gratefully wrong. My mom is a fantastic cook and this paste does a great job emulating that authentic, home made taste. At roughly $2 (or less on sale), this is far cheaper than going out to eat at an Indian restaurant.<br /><br />My girlfriend and I make this but we first cook down some sweet onion and brown the chicken a bit before adding the curry paste and water. The instructions tell you to add raw chicken but that sounds a little odd to us. We also like to add some extra heat via red chili powder. If you brown the chicken first, cut it into large enough pieces so that they don't dry out during cooking. We've also used this paste to make butter shrimp & it's a great alternative. All of our friends (Indian + non-Indian) LOVE this stuff. Indian approved!

review/summary: Excellent, easy butter Chicken
review/text: The best butter chicken you ever had!<br /><br />Start with a medium SWEET (very important) onion and 2 - 3 cloves of garlic minced. Sautee in butter, very slowly while cutting chicken into 1" to 2" cubes (small because it cooks faster). Add the chicken to the onion/garlic sautee and add 2 tsp turmeric (or to taste) and 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (more or less to taste).<br /><br />Start cooking your rice at this time.<br /><br />Cook over medium heat (don't burn the garlic) until chicken is done (5 to 10 minutes). Pre-mix the Kitchens of India Butter Chicken paste in a small bowl using hot water until smooth and add the mixture to the pan. Cook down to desired consistency.<br /><br />Optional: add tomato paste, plain yogurt or cream cheese (separately or in any combination). Or add a fresh mango cut into small pieces for "Mango Chicken".<br /><br />This makes a truly restaurant-class Indian dish and takes just 30 - 40 minutes from concept to meal. Serve with a small salad, fresh veggies and nan for a complete meal that is a real treat! Serves four (or two really hungry people). Double the recipe for 4 or more - the leftovers are just as good as the dinner and probably won't last until morning.

review/summary: So delicious and so easy!
review/text: I wasn't sure what to expect when I purchased this.  And I hesitated and hesitated...  But, I'm glad I finally got this!  This tastes delicious and it was so easy.<br /><br />You get 6 individually packaged boxes and each package has the directions. The packages contain one foil packet of the paste.  I first melted the butter with the water and then mixed the paste in. Then I added the chicken and cooked until ready.  That's it!  It was really all I did and it came out great.  The smell in the house while this is cooking was heavenly.<br /><br />I used a little less butter than the recipe asked for and it still turned out delicious.  We served this over rice and we really enjoyed it.<br /><br />There is also a Microwave Oven recipe for those folks that don't have a stove or would rather use the Microwave.<br /><br />The expiration dates on these were all well out into late next year, so I have plenty of time to use these.  But, there is no way they are going to last that long.  I'm sure I'll use these all up in the next month or so.<br /><br />Because of the great success with this item, I ordered some of the other items from this line.  I'm eager to test them out and see if they are as wonderful as this one.<br /><br />I have always wanted to make a tasty Indian dish at home and just didn't know how to go about it.  I'm so glad I found these.  Big taste.  And big money saver versus going to my local Indian restaurant.

review/summary: GOOD FLAVOR - TOO MUCH SALT
review/text: With a significant population of recent immigrants from India in the Silicon Valley came a welcome increase in the number of authentic Indian restaurants. San Franciscan's have always enjoyed a diverse bounty of culinary experiences and it's always a challenge to replicate the great recipes at home. I was hoping this product would accomplish that. while quite flavorful, the overall taste is burdened with way too much salt (not authentic proportion) so, like the other 3 star reviewer, I added one half can of coconut milk. The result was an improvement (if not anymore authentic) and tasted more like Thai Curry which I enjoy also. It's a shame that the saltiness dominates what could be a much better product. I even used unsalted butter and still found the saltiness overwhelming.

review/summary: An incredibly pleasant surprise!
review/text: I live in suburban Detroit and love Indian food. Unfortunately, the nearest Indian restaurant is probably 25 miles away from my home, which isn't real convenient. So when this Kitchens of India product was offered as a Lightning Deal from Amazon, I decided to take a chance on it. I was, however, very skeptical. How could something so simple produce great tasting Indian food at home? Well, I am skeptical no longer. I made this for the first time last night and was amazed at how easy it was. All you do is put your raw chicken pieces in a pot with some water, butter, and this product. Then you cook it for about 25 minutes. That's it. One pot and less than a half hour of cooking time. And let me tell you: While the taste of the finished product might not be exactly the same as that found in an authentic Indian restaurant, it's darn close. So close, in fact, that I'd be willing to bet that a lot of people couldn't tell the difference. I can't recommend this product any more highly. It will definitely satisfy my cravings for Indian food going forward! And you can bet that I'll be trying other Kitchens of India products soon! (Edit: One cooking suggestion that at least one other reviewer mentioned and I just recently tried... Add some chopped onions to the mixture for the last five minutes of cooking time. The onions make a great dish even better!)

review/text: This is SOOOO GOOOOOD.  Really.<br /><br />I used boneless thigh meat, and the meat came out fork-tender - absolutely fabulous.  I also used homemade chicken stock instead of water, but that probably didn't make too much difference in the flavor. Which is, without a doubt, heavenly.  I love curry, and I found the heat level to be just right.<br /><br />The one thing that I wasn't too crazy about, and I didn't see this noted in other reviews, is there was (to me) a bit too much grease on top of the sauce at the end of the simmer.  However, I just blotted it off with a paper towel.  This IS after all, made with 3 tablespoons of butter, and sunflower oil is listed in the ingredients.  (If you don't want grease, don't buy something with the word "butter" in the name - it's that simple. Duh.)  I didn't find the grease enough of a problem to downgrade the rating. Other people might not find it objectionable at all.<br /><br />I served this on top of plain jasmine rice, and it went together well.  The amount of sauce was generous, so it easily could be extended to at least one more serving with the addition of more chicken. I think that this would also be great with potatoes or tofu, as other reviewers mentioned.<br /><br />If I had ordered this dish in a restaurant, I would have been completely happy with it. I will definitely buy this again.  It's a winner!

Even my one year old was making "mmmm!" sounds for the whole meal. It's earned a place on our weekly meal rotation, and is fast enough to make during a busy weeknight. The only alteration I made was to toss in some onion and peas while it was cooking. It's a bit spicier than I was expecting, but still edible for a total spice wimp like me. I love this paste and can't recommend it enough. It makes Indian food easy enough to enjoy whenever you want without spending the money to go out.

review/summary: Great meal
review/text: I guess I'm no cooking pro and I loved this dish but I removed a star for two reasons. One, I expected this to be much more buttery then spicy and mine was definitely a pretty strong spice. The second reason being is at the end you have to cook it uncovered on high heat which will result in a mess all over the stove. Next time I would like to try adding some vegetables and using a bit more butter.<br />One package makes enough for 2 maybe 3 people. Price is excellent here on amazon I bought it on a deal and will likely continue to buy this every year.<br />Now if I could only make homemade naan bread....

review/summary: Very Good Paste
review/text: I ordered this on sale just to see what the hype was all about - now I know. It is very good curry paste. I prepared it according to the reviews; using milk instead of water, using less butter (1 T), browning the chicken before adding liquid, and adding lots of delicious vegetables. Obviously, this is not as good as preparing the spices from scratch, but it is a good substitute for a delicious and reasonably priced Indian curry dinner. It is spicy and has a kick to it (yum!). I recommend it.

review/summary: Delicious, But Not What I'm Used To
review/text: I've had butter chicken at Indian restaurants several times, and love it.  Before ordering, I noticed this is butter chicken "curry."  So, I wasn't anticipating it would be the style of butter chicken I'm used to.<br /><br />This paste is relatively spicy and the cooked dish tastes more like curry than butter chicken.  Actually, it didn't taste like butter chicken at all.  (Of course, the restaurants where I've eaten may have Americanized the dish.)  The chicken was delicious & so easy and fast to make!  I served it with Jasmine rice.

review/summary: Good but not what I expected
review/text: I'm not Indian, but I've been to India and eat Indian food often enough, and this "butter chicken curry" tastes like no butter chicken I've ever tasted. That aside, the curry is pretty good and flavorful (too much, perhaps), just don't listen to the directions and double the portions, otherwise it will turn out too strong (i.e one packet for two pounds of chicken). Also, note that if you don't add cream or yogurt, the paste won't come out creamy at all.

review/summary: Good quality
review/text: My wife's favorite Indian dish is Butter Chicken Curry, so I ordered this.  The flavor was good and it didn't take very long.  The sauce was too thick, though.  I probably did something wrong, but I would have preferred it to be thinner.  And the directions said to cook at high heat for several minutes after simmering.  This burned the curry to the bottom of the pan and was hard to clean.

review/summary: Flavor may be good but MUCH hotter than description would imply...
review/text: I understand that when describing or talking about food that "spicy" and "hot" may be synonymous to some but not others. I bought this based upon an incredible chicken butter cream curry dish I had many years ago in Australia that was flavorful with almost a bit of sweetness but not spicy/hot... I used one of these packets and found it to be WAY too hot for me and for many people who I was planning on serving it to. Spices and "spicy" can be great--but this was "hot," and even after adding 1/2 can of undiluted, full-strength coconut milk it was still very "warm" even served 50/50 with basmati rice. Flavor DID seem quite authentic and good but the heat can take away those pluses for the unsuspecting.<br /><br />This seems like a high-quality item but the description just wasn't clear about the heat level. Many Indian and East Asian dishes (and even Mexican) will have a heat meter graphically or in words on the package, which would have helped in this case. Authentic, good flavor--yes... but be prepared for more than mild heat.

review/summary: Hot, Hot, Hot, and more Hot!!!
review/text: When they describe this as a "mildly spiced gravy" - DON'T BELIEVE IT! This is the hottest thing I have eaten in a long time. In fact, I could only take one bite. I couldn't eat any more of it because it was so spicy. Felt like I was chewing up an actual hot pepper! I followed the directions exactly, and even added vegetables to it, and served it over brown rice. I am not a hot spice fan, and I was very misled by the description given for this product. I did give this 2 stars because it did have decent flavor if it wasn't for the heat of it. Without the heat, it would have been delicious. Now I have 5 more packages of this and they will probably go in the garbage. I doubt even a soup kitchen could serve this stuff.

review/summary: Great stuff in a packet! I'm addicted.
review/text: I love Indian food. Most of my friends have no stomach for it and therefore I rarely get to indulge myself. This is closest to a restaurant version that I have ever had. It must also be well liked by the general population, because my local supermarkets are always out of it. (And I live in white food county.) When they restock, I grab the entire quality they have. Believe it or not, I will drive to three or four supermarkets to find it in stock.<br /><br />I am also on a low carb, original Dr. Atkins Lifestyle. This stuff is perfect. It gives me the flavor that I desire in chicken with very few sugar carbs per serving (unlike many barbecue sauces and marinades).<br /><br />It is a bit salty. FYI so use unsalted butter.

review/text: This Kitchens of India Butter Chicken curry paste is a real find, tasty and well-priced. The preparation is so easy - just add butter, water, and cut-up chicken to the paste and stir. Well, you do have to turn on the stove.<br /><br />I used two boneless breasts and cut them into fairly large chunks as breast meat tends to dry out easily. I would think boneless thighs would work just as well. The whole dish was cooked in less than 30 minutes. Jasmine rice is the perfect accompaniment. The dish was a big hit with everyone.

review/summary: Surprisingly good for a box mix
review/text: I love to shop at ethnic grocery stores including those specializing in Indian foods.  That is where I first saw this product.  I noticed several Indian women of a certain age tossing these in their carts.  I thought, "well, if it's good enough for them..."  I bought a few boxes and later started getting it from Amazon.  I asked some friends of mine who grew up in Dehli (where this dish originated and is called Murgh Makhani) for some tips.  Here is how they told me to make it:<br /><br />First I cut up the chicken (I prefer boneless thighs but also use breasts) into bite-sized pieces and marinate them overnight in a plain yogurt, garam masala, minced ginger and garlic mixture.<br /><br />The next day I rinse off the chicken, pat the pieces dry and saute them over high heat in ghee (clarified butter) until browned.  I set the chicken aside and make the gravy separately and according to directions on the box.  Once it thickens up I add a little heavy cream (I've also used coconut milk for something very different), fenugreek, freshly chopped red chili peppers, and a little more garam masala.<br /><br />I add the chicken and then turn down the heat to very low and simmer the dish for about a half an hour to 45 minutes.  I garnish with sliced fresh curry leaves (when I can get them) and a pat of butter and then serve with Basmati rice and naan bread.<br /><br />This is a very popular dish in parts of India and this mix is sold in almost every Indian grocery store that I have ever visited.  This mix is a staple in my pantry.

I omit the butter and use a can of lite coconut milk.<br />The last time I prepared it I used cubed chicken breast and chunks of peeled potato.  At the last moment I added two big handfuls of raw spinach and let it wilt before serving.  Delicious!  You do not have to add meat; this make a delightful vegetarian dish.  Use about any assortment of fresh vegetables. This is also a good way to clean out the frig using up leftover meat and vegetables.  Just add it to the sauce and serve over basmati or jasmine rice.  Very economical.  We like this so much I am on auto-delivery.

review/summary: Delicious Indian Curry, Fast and Easy...
review/text: The Kitchens of India (KoI) Curry paste exceed my expectations.  This little 3.5oz packet contains a paste that instantly turns your boring chicken into a delicious spicy curry in under 30 minutes.  The recipe is incredibly simple and uses just a single pot/pan.  Just add approximately 1 lb of boneless chicken pieces into the pot/pan.  Add 2-3 tbsp's of butter.  Add your packet of curry paste + 1 cup of water and mix until the paste has been dissolved into the water.  At this point just let the cooking process take over, and in about 25 minutes you have delicious Butter Chicken Curry!  I usually have mine over some rice<br /><br />Simple, fast and the quality of the curry is excellent!  The curry itself is a bit creamy thanks to the added butter, and also has some kick to it.  It isn't overpowering but the added spices in the paste really come alive once you heat the curry up.  What I love about this flavor curry is the spices and mixture of ingredients.  They are balanced just right and leaves a slight spicy aftertaste that really makes you want to go back for a second helping.  The quality is outstanding on this KoI Curry, and while not as good as restaurant quality it comes pretty close.<br /><br />The only real downside is the sodium(salt) factor.  While the product is all natural, it preserves with SALT and thus the product has a higher than average salt content per serving (480mg).<br /><br />OVERALL I highly recommend this KoI Curry product.  The Butter Chicken Curry paste is delicious and even leaving off the "Butter" factor still results in delicious curry, though not as creamy. 5 stars!!!<br /><br />** Nutritional Information ** (Entire packet)<br />Each packet is 3.5oz (100g) and contains  FOUR(4) Servings.

review/summary: Excellent; has me revisiting the brand!
review/text: I was a little skeptical about trying this, as I was somewhat disappointed in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1AWBU">Kitchens Of India Curry Paste For Lamb Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Given that I found that one not quite as spicy as I like, I expected this to be too mild.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  The spice is just about right.  It is aromatic and flavorful (the degree of heat becoming less of an issue), made a nice thick curry: not at all what I had expected.<br />I am adding this review primarily because I'd expressed disappointment in the lamb curry paste and directed people towards another brand.  This one not only made me reconsider but revisit the brand to see what i had missed.<br /><br />My preparation deviated from the direction a bit.  I prepared it as if I were starting from scratch, sauteing the spices in the butter for a few minutes, and then adding the chicken to coat, and then the water.  I cooked it longer than recommended (but only because I was waiting for my family to get home), and it was really excellent!<br />When I saw how thick the sauce was (and it smelled divine) , I did not want it to go to waste, and so added some new potatos and cauliflower.  I think I am going to double my subscription to this one, and try playing around with some variations.<br /><br />I do not know how much of an impact my preparation had as I have only made it the one time.  It ois meant to be easy to prepare, literally less than 5 minutes (that said, what I did added only 3 minutes to the prep time).<br />A really excellent product, which has me back here looking for more :)

review/summary: Packs just the right amount of spiciness!
review/text: I had read great reviews about the "Kitchen of India" curry pastes and decided to try one out. The butter chicken curry came out great on my first try and I was truly amazed at how well it turned out as I'm more of a cook-from-scratch type of cook and have been disappointed by other curry pastes. This is definitely a reliable curry paste when one is short on time but would still like to cook at home.<br /><br />Anyway, I tweaked the recipe a little and the results were pretty good - I sauteed a medium shallot [sliced] in the butter [used smart balance as a substitute] on medium heat before adding the chicken pieces [I used organic chicken breast pieces cut into cubes] and the curry paste. Finally, during the last 5 minutes of cooking on high heat, I added two dollops of plain yoghurt to tone down the strong spice flavor and add a creamy texture to the dish. It turned out really well, and is great served with fresh steamed rice and/or naan or paratha. Also, stir-fry spinach goes great with this dish or even a cucumber salad. Highly recommended!

I love to cook, and it's not terribly difficult, but it always seems that the best dishes require dozens of ingredients, mostly spices, that have to be pre-blended in a specific order.  So I had pretty much relegated myself to getting my Indian food fix with occasional visits to my favorite Indian restaurants.<br /><br />Then I discovered the Kitchens of India products.  Oh. My. Goodness.  This stuff is incredible!  Butter Chicken is one of my all-time favorite dishes, and my favorite Indian restaurant (Saffron in Seattle) does an amazing version of it.  The Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Butter Chicken comes *very* close to the quality of that restaurant dish.<br /><br />The ingredients in the paste are all-natural -- no preservatives, nothing with unpronounceable names.  Just tomato paste and spices (mostly).  You just add butter (natch), chicken, and water, and let it simmer for 20 minutes.<br /><br />I've used chicken breasts cut into large pieces, and chicken thighs, too.  I prefer the flavor of thighs (skinless/boneless), but they're both good.  I usually serve it with Pulao -- Basmati rice spiced with cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, cumin seed, bay, cloves, sultanas, and slivered almonds.  Yum!<br /><br />Amazon's price is good, too, considering that you get 3 servings or so from each 3.5-oz package.<br /><br />I can't wait to try more of the Kitchens of India products -- so far, I've had this one and the lamb curry, and both have been exceptional.

review/text: I've spent a small fortune buying all kinds of Indian sauces and mixes from Trader Joe's and other places in my search for restaurant-quality Indian food (or anything even close to that) to make at home. Always I am bitterly disappointed in my search. I decided to give this paste a try because of the very high reviews and the low price with subscribe & save. I am amazed and so pleased with this product. It's truly delicious and a monkey (or my husband) could make it. I didn't follow the directions exactly -- I cooked the chicken until there wasn't any pink and then added the water, sauce and butter and let it simmer (just wanted to be sure the chicken was done). We served it over brown rice. This is SO fast and SO easy and SO good and SO affordable -- you cannot go wrong. I would recommend this a hundred times over and look forward to trying their other varieties.

review/summary: holy molee this is good
review/text: If you like indian food, this is definitely a great base to start with.<br /><br />We have made have made it with chicken, but I have been told that it tastes really good with other types of meat and vegan options.<br />I called this a great base as we have added some spices, milk, coconut milk and/or different configurations and surprisingly enough<br />they have all been been very tasty. My wife is learning to like spicy foods and she really liked it. She did think it was a little spicy. I grew up<br />eating very spicy items and I thought it was perfect and delicious!<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try. It is relatively cheap for what your get. I recommend getting some garlic naam or pita bread to go with it.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful!

review/summary: New to curry, here's my take on it
review/text: I was introduced to a Prima-brand curry paste a few weeks ago, not Indian, but a Singapore curry: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041CIP3M">Prima Taste Rendang Curry Sauce Kit, 12.7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> - unfortunately the price was too high for me, so I came across the Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry.<br /><br />While this is good, I prefer the Rendang Curry (with beef). Of course I used chicken with the KOI curry paste, and beef for the rendang.  The KOI has too much of a clove flavor for my taste, so I ended up adding 1/2 cup of light sour cream to it, and it was pretty good when served over rice.<br /><br />I'll try this with beef the next time, who's to say it has to be used with chicken?<br /><br />ETA - April 1, 2012:  Just tried this and used a lb. of beef stew meat instead of chicken. I thought it was better using the beef than chicken.

review/text: If it's curry, chances are pretty great that I'll love it!<br />I've never had butter curry chicken before, so don't have anything to compare this to. But the price on this pack of curry paste, is beyond reasonable so you can't go wrong!<br /><br />I think the chicken I used had water in it, because the pan was very watery after I uncovered it. I made another batch of it using 4 T. of butter instead of three, and cut the water down to 3/4 c. instead of one cup, and it was much better. I also used 1 1/2 lbs of chicken instead of 1 lb. per the box, so you can still get a nice amount of sauce with that much chicken if you want.<br /><br />Initially the curry sauce was a little spicy, and with a pronounced 'clove' taste that had me on the fence whether I liked it or not. But the taste grew on me as I finished the bowl. I made this a third time and subbed in 1 cup of coconut milk instead of the water, and that *really* tamed down the heat. It was creamy and mild.<br /><br />For the price, I am happy with my purchase, and how versatile the curry paste is. I think this would taste better with beef or lamb instead of chicken, though.<br /><br />This product does have flour and sugar in it, for those who keep track.

review/text: I've never had Butter Chicken before -- this makes me want to try it at an authentic Indian restaurant.  I brined 4 lbs of chicken thighs in a salt solution for 24 hrs and then put them in a crock pot -- I was a little concerned about using just one package of the paste but it worked.  I mixed about 2 tablespoons of tomato paste and added about 2 tablespoons of curry powder to the mixture and poured on top of the thighs -- then cut up 3 tablespoons of butter and scattered on top of that.  Cooked about 3 hrs on high, then reduced to low.  Once it was done, I shredded the chicken and put some on a plate with long grain rice. (Jasmine rice would be better...) I took a cup of the sauce out and mixed some sour cream in it -- made it nice and creamy.  The creamy sauce on top of the chicken and rice was very good.  My husband and 17 year-old son liked it.  I'll be making this again!<br /><br />Update -- 2nd time making this -- this time I put a 3# package of chicken thighs (didn't brine, etc) into a pressure cooker and browned in a little oil until nice and golden.  I mixed two packages of the spice, extra ground curry powder, a little tomato paste and used 3 cups of water + 1 stick of salted butter.  It took about 35 minutes total at 15 psi and was really good.  I did like the extra sauce by using the two packets with that much chicken.  Served over Jasmine rice and a nice dollop of sour cream -- I'm in gastro-heaven!

review/text: Seriously the best food product ever made. I buy three of the six-packs at a time, because I am addicted and make this stuff at least once a week. It requires simple ingredients (butter, water, meat product, curry package), minimal attention (put on stove, set timer, wander away), minimal prep (combine things in a pot), and makes the most epic left-overs (I eat mine over drained ramen noodles because I'm lazy and it is so easy/tasty). It is somewhat spicy though, and my sister hated it for that reason. So if you don't like spicy, maybe eat something that isn't curry. But if you DO like spicy, and you DO like curry... try it, and you can't go wrong. Nom nom nom...

review/summary: Fantastic and versatile!
review/text: I am a HUGE fan of Indian food, and have been testing out Indian convenience products for years.  This is BY FAR the best and most authentic!  As a nutritionist, I am pleased that the ingredients are compromised of "whole foods" - no nasty preservatives.<br /><br />It is good prepared "plain", but I have experimented with putting in diced bell peppers or frozen spinach with a bit of red pepper - delicious!<br /><br />The directions can be a little vague - bring the ingredients to a boil and then cover for 25 minutes.  I then put the lid on askew to let moisture out (but the mess in) over high heat for 5 minutes or more - this is crucial to the thickening of the sauce.<br /><br />I especially love that the 30 minutes it takes to cook is conveniently the same amount of time it takes to book Basmati rice :)<br /><br />I love this so much that I put it on my auto-order subscriptions on Amazon!  We make this at least every other week for a quick, delicious, healthy dinner.

review/summary: Outstanding!
review/text: I was a bit apprehensive about buying this since I've had somewhat poor experiences in the past with packaged Indian spices for curries. But, based on the positive reviews, I gave it a shot during the recent sale.<br /><br />Simply outstanding! Excellent blend of spices - great flavor, nicely spiced, and simple to prepare. I'd put the heat level at mild side of medium - some spiciness, but not overpowering. Personally, I like it more spicy, but others in the household don't care for hot food so this is just the right level to keep everyone happy.<br /><br />I scale back the amount of butter the recipe calls for (it says to use 3 tablespoons, and I use 1), and use stock instead of water. Cuts the fat and calories a bit without any loss of flavor or texture. I also add some veggies, such as peas, a few minutes before its done and serve it over rice. Love it!<br /><br />Highly recommend, and I'm going to be trying other mixes from this company.

review/summary: Something the whole family enjoys
review/text: I picked this up on a recent lightning deal because we are trying to incorporate "new" foods in our dinner routine.  I have to admit I am not a big fan of Indian foods because of their spices (curry, etc.), but I was willing to try this. The directions were easy enough and I actually divided it into 2 pans because my daughter is a vegetarian and doesn't eat chicken. We served it two ways, for us it was chicken in the butter curry sauce over rice and for my daughter is was served with rice and homemade roti. I have to admit that I was surprised that I liked it. The flavors were strong, but not overpowering and it was enjoyed by everyone in my family. We now have this at least once every two weeks. Because I haven't been able to locate this in a grocery store near me, I have continued to purchase it here on Amazon and the price seems to be very reasonable.

review/summary: POULTRY IN MOTION
review/text: My wife got a cooked roasted chicken from a big box store and ate only a small portion. (Well, actually our black lab mix got the chicken off the counter and it was entertaining to see my wife chasing our dog screaming "NOoooooooooo!!!)" When my order arrived the next day (PRIME SHIP), my wife wasn't home and it was around noon and I was hungry. First, I started the rice in our Zojirushi rice cooker.  After half an hour, I started to cook.  I melted butter in the pan and then placed chunks and pieces of the roasted chicken in it (our dog wagged his tail approvingly) and let it cook for a minute or two. (smells good so far...) Per instructions, I then squeezed out the curry from the packet and then poured a cup of water and brought it to a boil and simmered with a lid for 20 minutes, (smells REALLY good...) After that, I cooked for 5 minutes on high flame and then simmered with a lid for 3 minutes. Rice was done and poured the curry sauce on top and had a taste...  OMG!!!  OMG!!!  OMG!!!  What more can I say.  I spent $7.99 for a packet of 6 ($1.33) and used ordinary white rice and dog-slobbered chicken.

review/summary: Excellent Flavor and Very Easy to Prepare
review/text: I started using this product after purchasing it at a local specialty foods store.  A friend at work always brought curry for lunch and he told me that there were curry "pastes" that made cooking authentic curry easy.  I initially tried this flavor because it had the word "Butter" in the title and that meant it had to be good!  It is as easy to make as cutting up a chicken breast adding a cup of water and dropping in the contents of the sealed package.<br /><br />The flavor is tremendous!  I'm not Indian nor do I profess to be a connoisseur of Indian Food, but I know what I like and this product tastes so good to me that I can hardly set aside the portions I reserve for my lunches.  I store about a cup of prepared curry (with chicken in it) in small plastic bowls in the refrigerator along with separate portions of rice.  At lunch I heat them both in the microwave and then combine to eat.  It tastes just as good as if it were fresh from the stove. (I know this for a fact because I keep one portion to eat immediately every time I make this! HA!).<br /><br />Prime membership means I get this shipped free with two day delivery and the price is less expensive than if I purchased it locally.  I currently go though a pack of 6 every 3 weeks or so and just ordered a sampler to try other flavors as well.  I made the mutton curry yesterday and it is right on par with the butter chicken.<br /><br />I have no complaints about this product and I'm very satisfied with the  ability to order this from Amazon!

review/text: I cook a lot of Indian food with these "helper" pastes.  This is my favorite.  It has a subtle and enjoyable heat.  Not too hot for even a mild spice tolerance.  I follow the directions; however, I substitute about 150 mL of cream for some of the water.  Excellent with both the given pan cooking method as well as a more traditional pressure cooker approach.  You are sure to enjoy this with either preparation, but I recommend the added cream even if in a different proportion.  Great with Dosas or some Basmati Rice.

review/text: I feel like I'm cheating when using a purchased sauce, but this is so easy to make and I don't think that I could improve on it. Essentially, I cut up a pound of chicken cutlets, add sauce and water and simmer. I leave out the butter, making it no longer a butter sauce, but still yummy, and easier on my cholesterol level. I also add a couple of carrots, peeled and cut into chunks; they seem to cook in the same amount of time as the chicken. If you try it, you won't be disappointed.<br />I also recommend Kitchen of India's Dal Bukhara.

For less than $10 for a 6 pack, this is a great deal.<br /><br />Couple of things to note. This is a bit on the salty side for me. Instead of using a pound of chicken, I used two pounds, same amount of butter, and 3 cups of water. That equals four servings for me, served over rice. It would seem a bit watery at first, but after following directions and boiling for 20 mins or so, perfect texture and thickness.

review/summary: Love it! Tastes homemade!
review/text: I lived in two places in Nepal for a total of three years and had two different cooks/ house helpers at different times that made chicken curry in their own way every Friday night with palou (spelling) which is a rice fried in ghee with cashews, coconut, etc. This is by far my favorite meal in the world! I was seeking out an easy way to make chicken curry even though it is really not that hard to do. I tried the Kitchens of India Curry Paste for Butter Chicken Curry and was blown away. It was just the right heat and I followed the directions exactly and added the recommended amount of water. I always like to try it first according to manufacturer's directions and thought the thickness of the sauce was perfect and the salt wasn't overpowering but we may add a little more water next time. I definitely recommend to not forget the fresh cilantro at the end. It really brings everything together for that authentic taste! Everyone loved it including those that weren't accustomed to spicy food. They still tolerated the spiciness just fine even though it does bring on the sweat! My husband snuck in the kitchen the next day and ate all of the leftovers! He also requested this meal for his birthday. This tastes so close to what I ate in Nepal at my home there and in the local hole in the wall restaurants so it is a very pleasant reminder of my time there. It is delicious and I'm looking forward to eating it again!

review/text: If you are short on time or a dunce in the kitchen, this product will allow you to have a hearty meal with minimal effort.<br /><br />I add to my pressure cooker all the ingredients called for in the recipe on the package.  For meat I use boneless chicken breast.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes later, it is done.  Cooked this way, the chicken is so tender you can cut it with a spoon.<br /><br />The finished product does have some heat, but it is not overwhelming.

review/summary: Very Good Indian Curry
review/text: This curry is as good as any I have had in Indian Restaurants.  I still prefer Thai Curry over Indian, but I've tried the Thai products mentioned by other raters, and have been very disappointed. You won't be disappointed in this Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Curry Chicken. It is restaurant quality.

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: This is the BEST curry paste for butter chicken. I always change it up a bit depending on what I have on hand. Sometimes I add chopped carrots and onions and/or tomato sauce. It's always sooooo good. I have a regular delivery of it now :) I make my own version of naan bread with frozen bread dough balls (for rolls). While still frozen coat them with oil and let sit on counter while you prepare butter chicken. Then flatten out and "fry" on pancake griddle or skillet without adding more oil.

review/summary: Excellent and easy to do.
review/text: Really the easiest curry ever! I give it 5 stars even though it needed a few things added to bring it up a notch, I added Coconut milk to it at the end as well as a thai chili to kick it up some. I always add cilantro add the end as well. I also have used cream near end to give it a richer and creamier curry taste. It really takes out a lot of the work for you and tastes just as good as if making it from scratch. It works for breast as well as thigh meat, you just need more time for the boneless thigh meat to cook. The cooking directions are very precise and if using breast meat, you really should follow the recipe exactly as far as the method and time goes. For thighs you must wing it and figure at least 10-15 more minutes...it's hard to overcook the thigh, they are very forgiving. A great product to have in pantry.

review/text: My wife was mad because I bought this.  She thought I was buying more crap from Amazon.  She changed her mind after we made it and tasted it.  It is easy to make and comes out thicker than what you get at a restaurant. It is very tasty and I think that even though she can make this stuff from scratch, she would rather use this product going forward.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: When prepared as per the directions (add 3 tblspns butter, 1 cup water, 1 pound chicken) this is a savory and not overly spicy curry dish.  Even my husband who normally doesn't care for Indian dishes likes this.  I didn't think it was all that salty and no saltier than Indian places I've tried in our major cities.<br /><br />One packet yields 2400mg sodium, 60 calories, of which 25 are from fat.<br /><br />Made with tomato paste, water, sunflower oil, spices, onion, garlic, gram flour, sugar, salt, skimmed milk powder, fresh ginger, melon seed, cashe and spice extract (paprika oleoresin).<br /><br />Made in Colcutta (Kolkata), India in a facility that processes milk, peanuts, and other tree nuts.

review/text: I've guessed that I could duplicate the taste of this spice mix by other means.  I was wrong.  This is the most wonderful blend of flavors, not only for chicken but for other meats and vegetables.  Frozen chopped spinach is easy, cheap, and delicious with chicken.  For butter chicken, I use less butter than the packet recipe indicates, with no loss of flavor.  The flavors blend together with whatever you're cooking and mmm, the sauce is so good on rice.  Well worth the price.

review/text: I've loved having this in the cabinet for those days I didn't feel like cooking or needed something fast. Extremely easy to make, and tasty every time. I added peas in the last few minutes of cooking, and serve it over rice for a filling dish. Also good with yogurt if you are in the mood for something creamier.

review/summary: Sooo yummy!
review/text: A friend of mine introduced me to this product, but was unable to find it anywhere other than Amazon.  I love curry seasoning and this makes an incredible dish and it is easy to use.  The paste comes in a pouch, just add some butter and water and simmer, as easy as that.  I use cubed chicken and make some rice and dinner is served.  One package has 6 pouches, so it's pretty economical.

review/summary: Wonderful Flavor
review/text: This is a quick and easy paste that creates a wonderful chicken dish.  It is spicy, and could be too spicy for some.  If your tastes run to slightly above medium, I would say that you would enjoy this.<br /><br />We vary our recipe just a bit, still using the butter and water, but only a pound of chicken breast and two packets of the paste (doubling the butter and water) so as to have a very saucy, very curry-like dish.  When served over Basmati rice, it is simply delicious.

review/text: This is my go to chicken dish. Quick easy tasty and very simple to embellish. I have added every type of vegetable to this at one time or another, plus lots of different proteins. Think of it as a nice quality curry sauce that doesn't take up a lot of room on the shelf and use it as a base for your imagination.

review/text: I'm new to Indian food but got turned on by amazon KOI sale, I have enjoyed there ready to eat products and got the paste as a try me, well with only 1/2 hour spent in total I made a restaurant quality meal!<br />While I was eating my mind was thinking of all the variations I could with this wonderful spice.<br />Spices in general are very expensive and buying all that you need to start cooking Indian food would bankrupt you, so this makes a nice starting point ( get the 6 flavor varity pack first to try all)<br />I don't think u will be disapointed

review/summary: Chicken Makhani in half an hour!
review/text: I bought the Kitchens of India Paste hoping for a fairly authentic tasting version of chicken makhani (butter chicken) and I'm very glad to say that I wasn't disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Preparation was exceedingly simple. I cut up a few thawed chicken breasts, cooked them in just a bit of olive oil until they were nice and brown and then added the Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken, 3 tablespoons of butter (margarine in my case...worked fine) and a cup of water and then mixed it together until the sauce was mixed completely (takes a bit of stirring to work the paste and water together). I did add some very finely chopped onion and some fresh coriander (cilantro) and the end result was nothing short of delicious (very well seasoned with a good bit of spice, but certainly not spicy HOT like some here have reviewed...I wish it had been a bit more spicy frankly).<br /><br />Kitchens of Indian butter chicken paste is a great product. It's priced right, easy to use and tastes great.

review/text: I purchased this after reading some of the reviews that were already available. I will definitely say that I was not disappointed. The taste was excellent. Total prep time was about 30 minutes. The only minor complaint I have is that there was a small layer of grease floating at the top when cooking was done. Maybe I added too much butter. Amazing taste!

review/summary: So Salty!
review/text: They should rename this product Salt Paste For Butter Chicken Curry.  The sodium content is really high and I'm surprised by all the high reviews because you can taste it.  I even tried to add milk to cut it down but it only help minimally.  I understand how some people might like this if they like very salty foods and after all, you are adding 4 Table Spoons of butter to a 3.5oz product, it could be mud and it would be tasty to some people!  But for me, someone who eats Indian food often and realize that it's the butter and cream that can make things taste great just can't find the appeal in this product.  With a serving containing 480mg of sodium (1920mg for the entire 3.5oz)this product should be avoided not just because it's unhealthy but because it's just not really good. I'm adding 1 star because it's shipment was very fast.

review/summary: Needs some tweaking, but a good mix.
review/text: I bought the 5-pack a while ago and have been cooking each pack on and off for about a year and a half.  I just finished making the last packet and finally tweaked it to my liking.  I LOVE butter chicken at Indian restaurants, but I found that if you followed the instructions exactly on this packet, it doesn't taste anything like what I get in the restaurants (please no arguments about "authenticity").  What I did this last time was add MORE butter (around 5 tablespoons...closer to 6), add about 1/4 cup of 2% milk instead of 1 cup of water, about 3 tablespoons of honey, salt to taste (I usually hate adding additional salt when using spice mixes) and coconut milk instead of heavy cream at the end.  I have not tried any other butter chicken spice mixes, but I do like the Kitchens of India one for its nice spice kick.  Not too spicy hot, but enough for you to notice and enjoy while tasting all the other flavors.  It's definitely cheaper than going out, and it's nice to know that I can get close to what I get in the restaurants whenever I get a butter chicken craving.
