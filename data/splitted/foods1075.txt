review/text: Great taste.  My wife uses it because of her gluten-free diet, but I enjoy it also.  You can hardly tell the difference.  We often use the noodles in other macroni receipes also.  I give it 5 stars only because there aren't 6 stars.

review/summary: Good Option for Gluten Free Mac & Cheese
review/text: I bought this at the store before committing to a 12 pack. For a gluten free product it tastes very good. It does not taste just like Kraft Mac & Cheese but it's gluten free so what do you expect? It is very good for a gluten free mac & cheese and I am sure that gluten free kids who have never had Kraft etc. would like it a lot.

review/text: I just love this mac n cheese.  I have been gluten free for over two years now per the advice of my neurologist.  It is very difficult to find gluten free products that you can tolerate the taste, let alone truly enjoy it.  I thought this was delicious!  And the texture/consistency of the rice noodles is more than tolerable.  I have tried so many different pastas and this is my favorite thus far.  The last gluten free mac n cheese I tried was so bad, I was very skeptical with this one, but was very pleasantly surprised.

review/text: Before going GF, we loved Annie's mac and cheese... we really missed it! When we found this we were thrilled. It is very good. The pasta has a fabulous consistency - Annie's should sell it by itself!<br /><br />The problem is that one box does not make very much :( I need to make two boxes to make to make enough for my family. It is pricey as well and spending almost $3 on a little bit of comfort food is only worth it now and then.<br /><br />It's great for a treat but not a staple in my pantry.

Honestly, it's better than your typical wheat pasta kraft mac-n-cheese, but if you're searching for a fine culinary dining no type of mac-n-cheese is for you.

Since beginning the diet we have tried many other brands of boxed mac & cheese and my son only smells of them but won't eat. We have also tried 3 homemade versions but still won't eat. When I made this he ate 3 plates and the other three children really like it too. I've contacted Annie's to see if they will make other GF mixes. No others are planned soon.

review/text: This is one of those "it's good...for being gluten-free" products.  But it's nowhere near as good as Annie's original - the pasta has a bit of that grainy gluten-free texture I dread, and the cheese sauce is extremely bland for my palate.  However, I still enjoyed it and still plan to buy more -- I need my mac 'n' cheese fix!<br /><br />If you have a Trader Joe's near you, try their brown rice pasta -- much better texture than Annie's recipe.  Too bad Annie's doesn't sell their cheese powder separately.

review/text: This may not be "Kraft," but in my opinion it is better than the other gluten free mac 'n cheese mixes out there. It isn't terribly appropriate to compare it to a gluten box mix as those who buy this product do so because they CAN'T eat the gluten box mix. I like this product for a fast, tasty gluten free meal- I add coarse ground black pepper and vietnamese hot sauce, sometimes sprinkling chopped tomatoes and/or red peppers on top as a garnish. Of course homemade mac 'n cheese tastes better, but for a night when there's no time to do anything but turn on a burner and wait, this is a great product. (Amy's frozen mac n' cheese is also a winner- but avoid frozen glutino at all costs, yech.)

I put some salt and pepper on it and it is much better than the original mix and takes about the same amount of time.<br /><br />I like the idea of adding a bit of spice to it as well and will try that next time.<br /><br />This cannot be compared to the Kraft mix (and I loved that as much as anybody), but if you have to eat gluten free, this is a good substitute when you add some more flavor to it.

Annie's also makes frozen, microwaveable mac & cheese that is *very* good...it really just depends on whether you are used to the frozen/baked kind or the kind out of a box.

review/summary: Getting to enjoy a childhood favourite...despite the adult allergy!
review/text: At 33, I was hit with a sudden-onset (over the course of a month) wheat intolerance. I've always loved good food, have become an accomplished cook, and mostly cook from scratch. But...good ol' Kraft Mac & Cheese has been a childhood favourite that I've never stopped loving. When the wheat intolerance came along, I thought I'd never get to enjoy my occasional Mac fix again, but then I stumbled across this! It's received some criticism in other reviews here, but my guess they come mostly from people who don't have to eat wheat-free and either (a) aren't used to the slightly different flavour of the foods or (b) don't know how to prepare these foods properly (ie the cooking times/what to look for when preparing rice pasta), with the necessary tweaking. I thought this was delicious, worked well without a lot of doctoring, and was as close to my childhood favourite as I ever thought I'd get again. If you're like me, & thought you'd never get to enjoy that old Mac & Cheese standby, you'll love this!

review/summary: The BEST!
review/text: I don't have a gluten intolerance - just trying to cut back on the intake of wheat/gluten...and sugar, but that's another story;) so my body feels less bloated, unhealthy and lethargic due to wheat.  With that said, I do know the differences in taste between wheat pastas, rice, quinoa, corn...etc.  Personally, I have come to love the taste of non-wheat pastas over wheat, with the exception of corn flour, which isn't similar enough to wheat to fool my taste buds.  Annie's does a fantastic job with this rice flour product, giving it a consistency and flavor akin to Kraft mac and cheese.  What makes this better is the cheese, which tastes far yummier than any boxed mac & cheese I have ever had.  Also, it's real cheese, with as few bizarre ingredients as possible.<br /><br />For those who like to see ingredients, here is a comparison (and please note I am not a nutritionist - just writing a friendly review:):<br /><br />Kraft Mac & Cheese:<br />Cheese sauce mix ingredients: whey (milk protein), milk protein concentrate, milk, milkfat and cheese culture, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium phosphate and calcium phosphate, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, citric acid, lactic acid and enzymes.<br /><br />Annie's Rice Pasta & Cheddar: cheddar cheese (cultured pasturized milk, salt, non-animal enzymes), whey, buttermilk, salt, cream, natural flavor, natural sodium phosphate, annatto extract for natural color.<br /><br />*wiki annatto extract: Annatto coloring is produced from the reddish pericarp or pulp which surrounds the seed of the achiote (Bixa orellana L.). It is used in many natural cheeses (e.g., Cheddar, Red Leicester, Gouda (cheese) and Brie), margarine, butter, rice, smoked fish, and custard powder.<br /><br />Annie's also has less sodium and sugars, which I am grateful for.<br /><br />Also, Annie's does make another rice pasta mac and cheese - it's a deluxe box.  This is what I would compare to Velveeta - for you lovers out there.  It's the ooey gooey cheese that is thicker.  Personally, I detest Velveeta, so the deluxe isn't as awesome as the simple Rice Pasta & Cheddar.  But the deluxe IS better than macaroni with Velveeta because the consistency of the cheese isn't ridiculous overbearing and throat-clogging as Velveeta.  I swear, I always felt like I would suffocate eating that stuff!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product to those with allergies, and intolerance, or those like myself who are looking for ways to significantly reduce heat intake.  My entire family has now switched from Kraft over to this product (and they didn't do it for health reasons - they simply prefer the taste!)<br /><br />It's a bit more pricey, I'll give you that.  But for a hint - do check Target occasionally.  They sell Annie's pastas and some amazing organic bunny fruit snacks - all of which go on sale quite often (I just purchased Rice Pasta & Cheddar for $1 a box!)  If only the prices were always so kind;)

I let the water (along with olive oil and salt)  come to a rolling boil, dropped in the noodles, stirred until it came back to a rolling boil, and let it go for ten minutes stirring occasionally. I drained the noodles. While they were draining, I mixed 1/4 cup water, some butter, and the sauce packet in the pan until blended. I then tossed the noodles into the sauce and mixed. Perfection. It was just like Kraft, only way better. In fact, it was so good, I ate the entire box in one sitting. I ate it again the next day. This is becoming an addiction.

Cook noodles according to package instructions and set aside.  Melt 2 tbs butter in the still warm pot then add boxed cheese powder mix, 1/2 cup shredded mild chedder cheese, and the milk (keep the milk out because you may want to add more).  Stir these all together over very low heat until they've combined and have the consistency of creamy velveeta cheese.  Add the noodles and stir.  If it seems dry at all just add a little more milk (not too much or it will get soupy).  ENJOY!

review/summary: Great mac and cheese
review/text: Very tasty! Much better than that other brand with their "improved flavor" that is inedible now. If you're lazy like me, you can add the cheese powder directly to the buttered pasta. Just stir in slowly and it won't clump. Perfect with a dash of cayenne and paprika.

review/summary: kids love it
review/text: My kids love mac and cheese, but they are a pretty picky eater. If it doesn't taste good they will not even touch the food. After the first try of this mac and cheese, they keep asking for more. It's very rich, and you can tell the cheese is real cheddar. It's very easy to prepare. The kids don't have the patience to wait, so if you want to make the kids happy and cook something easy. Go with this.

review/summary: The Bunny Delivers Again
review/text: I'm a big Annie's fan, and they tend to cater to special diets, so when I started a gluten-free diet I knew they would have something at the store.  I was impressed by the texture and flavor, and very pleased to still have a familiar box in my pantry.  Here are some things to remember when preparing gluten-free mac and cheese: boil the noodles for substantially longer, and be sure to stir constantly.  If you cook them long enough, they will take on a texture very similar to traditional macaroni -- it just takes longer and the noodles end up comically large.  (I actually thought of this as a plus for a comfort food.)  The noodles are especially prone to becoming a brick if you don't stir regularly.<br /><br />One last thing with regard to the cheese sauce: I always use margarine/butter.  The box says it's optional, but it's really about as optional as if you were making Kraft mac and cheese.  You need margarine/butter for flavor and creaminess.  I found the cheese to be up to snuff when prepared this way.

review/summary: Great Mac and Cheese!
review/text: We put my son on a gluten free diet after he was diagnosed with autism. He has issues with texture of foods and eats very few foods because of this. Kraft mac-n-cheese used to be a favorite of his, but after going gluten free, we decided to try this substitute even though other gluten free pastas were terrible. To our surprise (with slight modification) HE LOVES THIS! I add slightly less milk and put a big scoop of butter in, also cook the noodles a little bit longer so they are tender. Honestly (and I am not gluten free), I like these better than "the real thing"!

review/summary: For GF - you can't get any better!
review/text: My 4 year old has Celiac disease. As most toddlers do - she lived on Mac&Cheese! I was sad for her. We tried almost every brand I could buy at the grocery store, Trader Joes (in California), Whole Foods, Namaste, Mrs Leepers Mac&Cheese, and all we could find online at the Gluten Free Mall. I tell you - most brands are so gross I spit it out. This was the only brand that was actually good. I actually would eat it with my daughter and was happy with it. We live in Denver so we have to cook it for 18 minutes, so that sort of sucks, but it is worth it. We have an "easy lunch" again and it is a real treat for her. Thank you Annie's! I am so happy...

review/text: One of my biggest concerns when told I was gluten intolerant was the possible exclusion of comfort food. Let me tell you, this is almost as good as Kraft Mac & Cheese dinner (mind you, the concession) ...The transition in diet was made much easier when I discovered Annie's product. Not only is it Gluten free, but I can make it with my own Lactose-free milk! I can't say I've been easy to adjust to my new diet, but Annie's makes it so much more bearable. I'm down to 3 times a week with this, but I'd easily consume it more. ...Don't know if they do, but if they offered other pastas, I'd be happy to try them with my own sauce!

review/summary: Something has changed...
review/text: I've eaten this product for years due to a wheat allergy.  I loved it so much that I convinced my non-gluten sensitive friends to eat it (and they love it).  For years, I ate it at least once per week.... until this last batch.<br /><br />I'm not sure what is different but this batch of pasta makes me very sick.  I wasn't sure it was the pasta.  The first time I cooked it, I blamed the broccoli I added.  The next time, I must have undercooked the chicken.  The next time, it was the pepper flakes' fault.  Then, the added garlic.  While working through the pack of 12, I eventually developed an aversion to it from getting so sick and started eating it only once per month.<br /><br />The last few times... again, sick.  So, today, I tried it just the pasta and water, nothing else... and sure enough, VERY sick.  I won't get descriptive but I am suddenly very, very sensitive to something in the pasta. I am 100% certain it is the pasta since I become sick within hours of eating it.  I am also positive I have never, not in years of regular consumption, had this type of reaction before this batch.  I just wanted to put it out there in case anyone else has a similar reaction to whatever has changed.<br /><br />I scanned the boxes, just now, to make sure I accidentally didn't get shipped a gluten case and noticed that this is new packaging.  So, maybe they changed the recipe with the colors/art on their box.  Either way, I won't be eating this again and it's a shame b/c it was such a versatile tool in an otherwise limited cross section of gluten free foods that my "typical" friends will eat.

review/summary: Best GF boxed mac n cheese
review/text: This is the best brand of boxed GF mac and cheese you can buy at this time. We have tried at least 4 and none come close to Annie's.<br /><br />In my opinion the cheese sauce is not the greatest in the world, but it is what it is. Apparently you can buy the Kraft cheese powder separately and it is gluten free and we have tried that but our kids did not enjoy it as much as the Annie's sauce. So maybe the taste is a subjective issue. You could probably do better making your own cheese sauce and buying bulk gluten free elbow noodles, but then you would be defeated the purpose of buying boxed mac n cheese wouldn't you?<br /><br />I always wait until they have it for &lt;$2 a box and buy a bunch to store.

I have made some from scratch that are great, but that's not something I always have the time to do.<br />The noodles cook up very consistently, the texture is pretty close to the 'real' thing.  The packet of cheese flavoring that comes with it is not stellar.  After I add in some cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, and some spices  it tasted pretty good.  This will work great when I'm short on time.

review/summary: Better than the wheat version
review/text: My daughter always loved Annie's products and has enjoyed them since age 1.  Now she has been diagnosed with wheat and egg allergies, we absolutely depend on items like these for the times when cooking is a tough situation.  Annie's is delicious and the rice noodles, when cooked to the full time recommended, are fantastic--I just add another 1/4 cup of grated cheddar along with the sauce (after the noodles have been drained), and cook over low heat until the sauce has thickened up.  A little bit of pepper on top, and it's great all by itself.  Don't forget you can always normalize this more by adding chopped heated tender ham, chopped fully-cooked hotdogs, or some thawed peas.  I totally recommend the subscribe and save every 3 months to save money, rather than having to buy this at the few grocery or health food stores who have it at a much higher price.  You just can't beat the free shipping too.<br /><br />The kids I serve this to (when we have company) and my nephew devour this.  They don't notice any difference and tell me it's the best mac and cheese they've ever had.

review/summary: Tasty, Filling, and Nutritious
review/text: Annie's rice pasta has a firm, toothsome texture that semolina pasta can't match, and the cheese is mildly sweet and tangy (the instructions say the cheese will stand up without butter, but use it anyway to cut minor Cheetos-like overtones).  Though pricy, it is nutritionally rich and has a good flavor, unlike regular macaroni, which is mostly filler and serves to deliver the cheese.<br /><br />This product has the advantage of being gluten-free, but even if you're not on a restricted diet, I recommend it.  Both healthy and tasty, it's a step up from the garbage that got most of us through college.  You need to eat less of it to feel full, thus offsetting the greater price, and it's so tasty that you need to eat WAY less of it to have your taste buds satisfied.  Savings, nutrition, and good flavor... what more could you ask for?

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I bought this to eat as a birthday treat, I am undergoing the "gluten challenge" pending Celiac diagnosis but did not want to be sick on my birthday so I skipped a day of eating gluten foods (after the tests are performed I am forced to be gluten free for life anyway, I am confirmed gluten intolerant whether or not it is full on Celiac disease). This macaroni surprised me, I had the expectation that gluten free food wouldn't really taste like food at all. The al dente texture of the pasta was awesome, I had expected it to be even mushier than regular macaroni sometimes gets and it wasn't at all. The cheese sauce was just as good as the regular Annie's (my fav!). The only thing about it I don't like is that the rice noodles don't have much flavor of their own at all and they stick together a bit worse than wheat pasta does, but it is what it is. I knew it wouldn't have that yummy wheat taste but it was still a little disappointing. I gave it four stars because yes, I'll eat it again, but it needs a little something extra in the cheese packet to counter the blandness of rice noodles.

It doesn't fall apart like many rice pastas.  The cheese sauce definitely tastes less artificial than other brands like Kraft.

review/summary: You can't tell that it's gluten-free.
review/text: This is a wonderful gluten free product that is definitely a great replacement for the "real thing."  The noodles are nearly the same texture as Kraft's Mac & Cheese.  They're not grainy, gritty, mushy, etc.  The cooking directions are just as simple to follow as the traditional versions.  I find the sauce to be a little thin when I follow the directions exactly, but it's easy to customize it to your preference.  The cheese sauce isn't as strong as Kraft's, but I really think it's better that way.  You can always add to it if it's an issue.  (I don't know if this reference helps many people - but it's similar to Trader Joe's Mac & Cheese.)  The suggested serving size is realistic.  One box is plenty for 2 - 3 children.<br /><br />I'm really happy with this product.  It's something that I can give to my son with Celiac disease to help him feel like he can eat normal everyday kid-food.

review/summary: G-Free Mac & Cheese
review/text: Annie's G-Free Mac & Cheese, is awesome. For kids or adults having a replacement for Kraft M&C is great. Having eaten both, I admit there is a taste & texture difference. If your child is newly diagnosed with Celiac, then they may not like this the first time around. Be patient, it will likely take time for them to get used to it. Amazon's price for a case using subscribe & save is probably the best deal around.

review/summary: Great Product, Lousy Packaging.
review/text: The Pasta and Cheddar was wonderful, as always. It allows my wife, who is Gluten sensitive, to have mac and cheese, which she loves. My complaint lies in the packaging. I had indicated that the item was a gift, yet the package arrived with the contents boldly indicated on the box. It also had the invoice openly displayed, which I had requested not be done. In short, LOVE the product, but the packaging policies need to be reviewed.

review/summary: Annie's GF Mac & Cheese
review/text: This is one of the first gluten-free foods my daughter found edible when she was diagnosed with Celiac five years ago. It has become one of her comfort foods in spite of the fact that she was never a fan of quick-to-fix mac & cheese before her diagnosis. Gluten-free foods--especially pasta and macaroni can be really fussy--so please take note--just because some reviewers make talk down certain products it's really a matter of personal taste. Don't be afraid to experiment for yourself!!

review/summary: Great alternative!
review/text: We finally found an alternative GF mac n cheese.  The kids sure miss my Kraft every now and then so when we stumbled upon this alternative that was GF we were so happy!  At least they can now have some good GF mac n cheese that doesn't seem all to different from the regular Kraft version.  The noodles look like Krafts, however the cheese is slightly different tasting.  Not bad but just not exactly Kraft.  We add extra deli american cheese to ours and that seems to help.

review/summary: Love it!! Always rinse the noodles!
review/text: My whole family gobbles this up - do not be afraid to cook longer than the box says to get the noodles nice and tender.  Then I always pour the cooked noodles into a strainer in the sink and rinse all the "sludge" (from the brown rice) with cold water.  Then I warm it back up in the pan, usally adding some sour cream, butter, & salt/pepper to the sauce mix.  As a former lover of all things gluten-containing, I have to say that when the rice pasta is rinsed, I think it's just as good if not better than traditional wheat pasta.  "Shocking" the pasta with cold water makes all the difference in the world! Hope this helps.

review/summary: Another satisfied customer
review/text: I'm new to the gluten-free way of eating and have been experimenting.  I just happened across this in the supermarket and thought I'd give it a try.  I generally don't eat much in the way of pasta, but since I often feel unwell, the convenience was appealing.  Other reviewers commented on the need to cook the noodles a bit longer than the directions call for and I think there may be something to that.  I ended up using the 14K BTU burner on my gas stove for a full 10 minutes and they came out great.  I think if I had used the regular 9K BTU burner and stuck to the required cooking time, the noodles may not have turned out so well.  You also need to stir the noodles within the first few minutes that they come to a boil or they will start sticking to each other and the bottom of the pot.<br /><br />I was a little apprehensive about how this dish would taste and I have to state that I really couldn't tell the difference between this product and the "regular" version.  I was never a huge fan of the Kraft  product because I prefer homemade to stuff out of the box. But allergy season is looming and I knew that I needed a variety of convenience foods on hand for the high-pollen count days that always make me too sick to prepare meals from scratch.  But as grateful as I am to find another gluten-free food that I actually enjoy and want to stock in my pantry, this is one that will have to be an occasional indulgence. Because even though it is gluten-free and its target market is more health conscious than average, this product is quite high in sodium. I'm very surprised that health-conscious parents would feed this to their children often enough to need a subscription! Especially when frozen vegetables are so quick and easy to prepare.

review/summary: This stuff is amazing - and the Amazon price can't be beat!
review/text: My 3 year old AND my husband are gluten intolerant (and we have suspicions about my 1 year old daughter - Yay for genetics! lol). Mac & cheese was one of my son's favorite things to eat prior to our little health 'discovery' about a year ago and it used to break my heart to have to explain over and over to a toddler why he couldn't have simple macaroni (or cookies, crackers, pancakes... you get the idea). This stuff is a LIFESAVER. It tastes great - my son gobbles it up in no time every time I make it for him. The only store that I can find this at is a major-chain health food store that's about 25 miles away - and the price is double what Amazon is charging. Buy it - you won't be disappointed. I'm a customer for life.

review/summary: It's delicious
review/text: Boiling the noodles a minute or too longer makes the noodles softer if that's your preference (it is mine). Make sure that you have a lot of water in the pot to boil the noodles and remove the starches. Then before you add the noodles back into the pot, melt two pats of butter and two slices of Kraft sharp cheddar cheese in the pot until it is the consistency of a rich cheese sauce.  Don't overcook this sauce - it will dry out!  When mixing the powdered cheese, use whole milk instead of the reduced fat milk and wisk the mixture until it is smooth.  Add the sauce you wisked into the pot with the noodles and the first cheese sauce base.  Heat the entire mixture again for just a minute or two until the sauce thickens up.  The final dish is incredibly rich and delicious.  Easily comparable to the best box product out there...seriously! And it's gluten free.

review/summary: Nice flavor and great texture to the noodles
review/text: Annie's GF Rice Pasta and Cheddar Mac & Cheese does not have the same flavor as what you ate before going gluten free so do not expect it to taste the same.  After you get over the fact that it does not taste like Kraft you can appreciate it for what it is, a nice way to have a quick meal.  It is not a main dish, more of a lunch.  I cook the noodles exactly in the range printed on the box (setting a timer). They always turn out al dente.  Then I add the powder and some coconut oil (as a butter replacement).  I stir that up and then add some milk, less than the package recommends because I like a sharper flavor.  I return it to low heat as I stir and combine the cheese powder with the milk.  It turns out smooth with a mild cheese flavor.  I divide the box in half for two adult servings.  My husband eats the whole box.<br /><br />For a change I have also mixed freshly grated Parmesan cheese with it for a change and I love the flavor that adds!

review/summary: Good substitute for "regular" box mac & cheese
review/text: I buy this product for my son who is on a low wheat diet.  It's pretty good but as others have noted you must cook the rice pasta longer than the box indicates for it to be edible (especially for a child).  After the pasta is cooked I prepare it just like you would prepare the typical box mix (add the butter/margarine back to the pan with the hot pasta, then add in a small amount of milk to get the correct consistency).  If you have an extra minute or two, it is also better to heat up the mixture in the cooking pot/pan.  This blends everything together really well.  My opinion is that it is not good at all if you follow their preparation directions (my son has rejected it several times when prepared by their directions).

I also used it on a really bad laceration and crushed finger tip that was almost cut off from a door. The price might be a little expensive, but its well worth the price for the healing properties this awesome medical grade honey has. Look for either the MGO 400 or its equivalent UMF 20+. This type of honey is not like table honey, it a powerful honey that is only found and created in New Zealand has great antimicrobial, anti-fungus, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and antiseptic properties. It can also be used for acne, skin disorders, and is safe for use in infections in the eye socket, nasal cavity, and ear cavity. It may be taken orally to provide great health for your digestive system and overall health. Do your own research and be patient, and you will see its great healing benefits. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Initially sceptical but it is doing as predicted
review/text: Cleared up my lingering laryngitis, which was not being helped with any dr prescribed medication. We have used it 3-4 times now when the family have seemed to be coming down with colds. A teaspoon in the morning - we put it on the cereal or eat it off a spoon, within 2 days in each case we were back on track.(ie. green boogers the color of lettuce and severe congestion, to clear mucus and next to no congestion). My mother in Australia put us on to it - she used the UMF 24 to clear her own Laryngitis and enlarged nodules on her vocal cords (she's a teacher and after 40 years of yelling after kids I guess it took it's toll - I guess I didn't help much on that score either!). As a side affect she noticed it really alleviated her arthritis aches and pains, so she now eats the active honey as a form of maintenance. She's a firm believer.
