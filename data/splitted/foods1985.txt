review/summary: Delicious, no-nonsense taste
review/text: This is the second time I've ordered Golden Valley Buffalo Jerky--I've had the 'original' flavor, which was great; and decided on ordering the 'sweet N' spicy' flavor this time. I was not disappointed. For those who seek serious burn, this is not a particularly 'spicy' jerky, but I think it is exactly the right touch--not too hot, but spicy enough to give your taste buds a bit of a reaction. The jerky pieces vary in size--as would be expected when one slices an actual piece of meat--and texture (ditto), but there are no pieces of grisle and I've only come across one piece that was too hard to chew...<br />Basically--great snack.<br />I require a fair amount of protein in my diet to maintain my metabolism, and this is an excellent resource. Not to  salty. A little sweet. Nutritious, no MSG junk. And knowing (or hoping, rather) that the buffalo gets to live a reasonable life (i.e. not stuck inside one big brick house with flurescent lights and questionable food, but actually eating what buffalo are meant to eat and hopefully roaming about a bit), helps to.<br />Works for me!<br /><br />Awesome if you need to add something quick to a soup or stew: just dump a few pieces per serving in the pot and watch it move up a notch or two (or ten).

review/summary: 2.5 stars really - too sweet
review/text: I have just gotten the turkey, beef and buffalo from this company. The beef jerky had a highly processed feel and was way way too sweet and was not the best quality meet. The turkey was decent, and for the price pretty good with thicker pieces and not as much over-sweetening. This buffalo is in the middle of the two. This jerky is still way too sweet, but the pieces and meat quality are much better than the beef jerky. I  probably will re-order the turkey, will never re-order the beef, and am on the fence for this one. Worth a try, but be prepared to find it too sweet!

review/summary: Sweet Buffalo Jerky
review/text: in an effort to shed a few pounds, i decided to restrict my diet to high protein foods, vegetables, and nuts. When I learned that jerky was a great snack for dieters who wanted protein on-the-go, while avoiding the added carbs in meal replacement bars, I searched for a brand of jerky that was right for me.<br /><br />Knowing very little about jerky (save for the junk in convenience stores), I learned that most brands are full of hormones, nitrites, antibiotics, MSG, and erythorbate. Supposedly, none of these ingredients are harmful in moderation, but I was looking for a snack that I could rely on whenever I had food cravings, and I couldn't afford to compromise my health in the long run by regularly consuming any of these items. So, I was pleased to find out about Golden Valley's line of all natural jerky.<br /><br />Aside from the benefit of finding a vendor that produced a jerky free of preservatives and added MSG, there was the added bonus of learning that federal law actually prohibits the use of growth hormone in buffalo. My mind at ease, I ordered the peppered buffalo jerky and received it in record time using the super saver shipping option.<br /><br />As a meat snack, I found the product to be too sweet for my liking, but nevertheless adequate for my purposes. The texture is milder than the low quality jerky that I'm familiar with, but the pepper flavor could easily go unnoticed as it's way too understated. Every bag that I received was moist and easy to chew and the product was free of flaw or defect.<br /><br />At $1.49/oz., I get 11 grams of protein for the cost of 90 calories, 1 gram of fat, and 7 grams of sugar. Compare this to the leading meal replacement bar on Amazon that costs $2.07/bar for 27 grams of protein, 2.5 grams of fat, 26 grams of sugar (51 grams of total carbs), and a litany of unwanted ingredients in each 3.5-oz. bar. Ounce-for-ounce, we're looking at 11 grams of protein in the jerky versus roughly 8 grams of protein in the bar. Even considering the disappointing sweetness of the jerky, I still manage to avoid all the unwanted carbs and confections of replacement bars. Of course, jerky loses out in terms of cholesterol content.<br /><br />Jerky connoisseurs will likely find the sweetness of this product to be unappealing and off-putting. On the other hand, it's been a great diet aid and a reliable, additive-free defense against mid-meal cravings, and that's really all I wanted out of Golden Valley's Buffalo Jerky.

review/summary: Great Taste & Great Value
review/text: I love buffalo jerky but don't eat it too often because of the cost.  One company in Jacksonhole, WY charges nearly half the cost of the product for shipping and handling.  And at $45 a pound plus $21 for shipping, it's just way too pricy no matter the taste. Another company out of Texas has jerky that is so hard that you need to soak it in water to soften it up for eating - yuck!  So when I decided to try Golden Valley, I did so without much anticipation that it would be pliable to eat due to the cost.  Instead I love it!  The jerky is delicious with the perfect amount of pepper and just enough sweetness to give it a pleasant under taste.  I don't have to tussle with the jerky trying to eat it as it is pliable yet gives that chewy pleasure that good jerky properly prepared has.  I will be ordering over and over again now that I've found a brand that is good value and delicious!  Thank you Golden Valley!

review/summary: This is the best jerky available
review/text: I've tried scores of jerkys and this one is the best of the best.  I used to prefer Snackmaster's hot & spicy jerky but I got too many packages that were spoiled with fungus.  Eventually I found Golden Valley Natural Buffalo Jerky.  It has no added hormones, no antibiotics, no preservatives, no MSG, no nitrite.  I've been buying this product from various sources, directly from the company (Jerky Direct) as well as through Amazon (which has the best price.)  I noticed Whole Foods Market sells this product.  It isn't as hot as the Snackmasters but I have never had a package that was spoiled.  This is wonderful jerky!  I highly recommend a book called "The Omnivore's Dilemma".  If you read that, you'll appreciate grass fed meat a whole lot more than feed lot meat that most other brands of jerky are made from.

review/summary: Too Hot
review/text: I like the other jerky products I have tried from Golden Valley very much, but the Sweet N' Spicy Buffalo Jerky is a bit too hot for my taste.  I thought "sweet and spicy" meant medium hot since it wasn't called "Sweet and hot".  This jerky is hot.  It is hard to appreciate the jerky or the sweetness of it if your mouth is burning.  Actually, it is not burning red hot, but is a little too hot for someone who likes spicy to be a little less than medium on the hotness scale.  The jerky itself is wonderful - just the right amount of tenderness and chewiness.  If you like a little less than medium hotness, then try a different flavor of their jerky - they're great!

review/summary: Be careful, some packages were moldy.
review/text: Two stars because I've had this product before from the store and it is fantastic and very healthy.  However when I thought I was getting a great deal from Amazon, it turns out that when it arrived, half of the bags were moldy! However, Amazon was great about it and refunded my money.  Perhaps the lack of preservatives give them a very low shelf life, so if it's low in sodium, consider buying from a local store when you can check the package and dates before buying.

I need gluten-free meals so I need to serve things that my family likes and are safe for me. This really fits the bill.  Not as great as made from scratch, of course, but a very acceptable shortcut for week nights. They suggest making it with water or broth;  I always use canned broth.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like Assam (or much of anything)
review/text: I've been drinking various varieties of Assam for 10+ years - while I am certainly no tea expert, I know what it is supposed to taste like. The place I've ordered from for the past 10 years went out of business, so I figured I'd try my luck with this one. My first clue that this tea would not be very good should have been the price - 2 lbs for $18 is a steal, Assam is usually twice that. My second should have been the lack of any classification, such as TGFOP (Tippy Golden Flowery Orange Pekoe)in the description. I noticed those things, but I ordered it anyway so shame on me. The third clue that I'd made a mistake was when I opened the package - no orange hues, no tips, just a see of blackness in the bag. I've made a pot every day for the past week, thinking maybe the flavor (or lack thereof) would grow on me ... no such luck. It would have been a bargain at $18 if it was at all drinkable, but in my opinion it is not.

review/summary: Like Wine In A Box-- Good for what it is.
review/text: Assam is one of the largest tea growing regions in the world, and produces a huge amount of black tea. For that reason, "Assam tea" is a little like "California wine"-- it can refer to a rare vintage product that costs a week's salary per glass, or an inexpensive beverage that can be bought with the change found in the couch cushions.<br />With that in mind, this is a moderately priced tea, and it is of a complexity and flavor that corresponds to that category. It is very drinkable, and does have some of the musky, malty character found in Assam teas I have been buying from other providers (including the Indian brands) for over 30 years. It has the characteristic "black stick" rolled leaves that almost look spray painted with black matte paint. It has the characteristic dark color when brewed. It has the rough and tumble flavor that is just shy of bitterness. It is not quite as acidic ("brisk") as some other teas which might go by the name Assam as well. It is just a basic drinkable tea, and OK for everyday.<br />It can get bitter if steeped too long, but as long as one exercises caution, this can be a satisfying cup.<br />Just don't expect vintage cabernet. You aren't paying those prices.

review/text: I don't often review food items (usually books, movies and the like). But this almond butter by Onceagean is just THAT good. The flavor is really rich (particularly compared to peanut and cashew butters) - you can very much taste that this is made up of roasted almonds. And while the texture is nice and gritty (the way I like it!), the butter still spreads really well on bread. Ever since getting my first jar about 6 weeks ago, this has quickly become a snacking "go to": a piece of wheat bread, some rich, delicious Onceagain almond butter, and I am good!

I usually do not refrigerate my peanut butter, but this really needed cooling down, so into the refrigerator it went.<br /><br />Once it had had a few days to acquire the appropriate consistency, I tried eating some ... on bread, on celery ... all I can say about the flavor is there is none or, if there is, my tastebuds refuse to recognize it. The texture is more grainy than crunchy.<br /><br />Too bad it is a 16 oz jar ... I would feel less guilty throwing it away. Maybe  I can toss it with breadcrumbs and put it out for the birds.

It doesn't have anything added to it.  At first I wasn't too sure about the taste, but now my taste buds are very happy.  You have to stir it up a little due to separation, but it is minimal.  It is organic for those that try to buy only organic products.  If you are looking for true almond butter, beware of other almond butter products that add ingredients to sweeten it up.

It is cheaper than organic raw marantha and almost the same price as non-organic raw Maranatha.<br />I used to always buy the non-organic raw Maranatha, but since all my foods are organic, the butter was the only food that wasn't organic, so I decided to buy it organic. ^^

review/summary: Buy Sicilian Almonds--All US Almond Crops are void of Nutrients!  Boiled/Pasteurized/ Radiated!
review/text: All Almonds grown in the U.S.A. are DEAD!  I found out that they are either full of pesticides and/or boiled.  I purchase Sicilian Almonds, because they don't have to be "pasteurized".Russ Bianchi is the most famous formulator in the world.  Here is THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT and certified organic:  [...], you can read about his company Adept Solutions, Inc.  His credentials include PhD Harvard, PhD Berkley and UCSF.  Here is his review of Almonds grown in the U.S.<br /><br />Illegal/medical legal POT is the number one cash crop in California, followed by almonds.<br /><br />As a matter of fact our founder and true great and good soul Ken Brailsford grew up in a part of California that had many almond orchards, where as yours truly grew up among the prune orchards (all now gone to grapes).<br /><br />California's gross production in revenue remains agricultural and mineral or petroleum output; not movie stars and silicon valley.<br /><br />I remind you the USDA (Congress - all incumbents in the US House and US Senate) LIED a few years back to EVERYONE, and ordered the "pasteurization" of the entire California Almond Crop (approximately 98 percent of the world's supply).<br /><br />There are always major problems whenever Uncle Sam (proven pimp for death merchants like Big Pharma, Genetic Modification, Tax Revenue From Tobacco, Alcohol, Guns, Ponzi Scheme Social Security, Eugenics, etc.) sticks their gluttonous claws into anything.<br /><br />In the case of almonds, there is NO "pasteurization" going on, almond growers and producers are forced to harmfully IRRADIATE the almonds (just like cancer causing scanners from TSA in airports); ripping out the nutrient values on all almond products.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, almond milk is highly heated, enzymatically dead, nonabsorbable and nutrient void, aseptic, white, fake, sugar water.<br /><br />Ladies and Gentlemen, the canary in the mine is not only dead, when it comes to what Uncle Sam has allowed to happen to food and beverage processing in America, the canary long ago disintegrated, and the mine has collapsed and been abandoned.<br /><br />Want real nutrients?<br /><br />You better consider DRINKING LIFE IN!<br /><br />~ Uncle Russ<br /><br />Almond giant Blue Diamond will break ground next month on a multi-million dollar, state-of-the-art monster almond processing facility in Turlock, California.<br /><br />Want to learn more about what we are putting into our bodies, his website is a treasure trove of empirical data.  Including 2009 Nobel prize winner for Physiology Dr. Blackburn of the UCSF.  BTW, he does NOT sell anything on his website.<br />Knowledge begets Wisdom.<br /><br />Google Sicilian Almonds and Sicilian Almond Butter--You will be glad you did!

review/text: The Matsutake is a wonderful flavored mushroom in common use in Japan. It gives a savory and meaty flavor to the broth. Umame I think thy call it. This broth, while very light, has great taste and is wonderful for when you are feeling cold and need a little warming or feeling ill. It stays down even if you have the flu! It also makes a great vehicle for pork balls and chicken mushroom balls that you can toss in and microwave in the soup. This soup is very hard to come by in the US, even in oriental markets. Snap it up when you have a chance!

review/summary: Paying for Convenience
review/text: I normally like to make things like waffles and pancakes from scratch, but there are days when time is short and you don't want the hassle of mixing all of the ingredients. I suppose you could buy them frozen and pre-made, but I think a mix like this is a good compromise.<br /><br />Shirley J Buttermilk Pancake & Waffle Mix is easy to prepare, and the light, fluffy end-product tastes great. The plain pancakes are amazing and you can always add extras if you want--blueberries, banana, chocolate chips, etc.. My kids prefer them plain with a drizzle of maple syrup. Waffles are my favorite, but you need to add an egg and some oil when making them. No big deal, but it adds an extra step or two. They'll never top my Mom's homemade waffles, but if you add a little nutmeg and cinnamon, they come close.<br /><br />The ingredients list is fairly wholesome, if not health store level, and one pancake (estimated at 57 grams) is 100 calories; before syrup or extra butter. My one concern is that sodium levels are rather high at approximately 340mg (14%). Three pancakes and you are almost at half the recommended daily allowance. Still, pancakes and waffles are usually a weekend treat so it isn't too big a deal.<br /><br />Each four pound bag of mix will yield about 90 pancakes so you're looking at 11� per pancake, before shipping costs. Not a bad deal. If you don't want make them from scratch, and don't want to use frozen, then buttermilk pancakes and waffle made from the Shirly J mix could be your answer.<br /><br />For an extra-indulgent treat, try making a sandwich from 2 waffles and some creamy coffee ice cream. Top it with whipped cream if you like. Now THAT's good eatin'!<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: A consistantly decent Lapsang
review/text: I love Lapsang Souchong tea.  If it doesn't taste and smell like a campfire (my wife says probably combined with old socks) I'm not interested.  Taylor's always tastes the same from lot to lot.  My wife doesn't drink Lapsang, so I keep my private stash in a double layer ziplock bag, one bag inside the other and squirrel it away where it won't be disturbed. The extra effort to keep it fresh really makes a difference.  I drink several other teas, so I don't go through a box of anything very quickly, but when nothing will do but a decent smoked tea, Taylor's works for me.<br /><br />If I was a Pasha and had unlimited funds, every cup of tea I drank would be made from a just opened box; it makes that much of a difference.<br /><br />The first taste of tea for many people turns them off because it's probably a box of Lipton or Tetley (friends don't let friends drink nothing but Orange Pekoe) that has been in the cabinet since the Titanic went down.  Not a good first impression.<br /><br />If I'm using one of the giant sized mugs, I put two bags in, not one; a good rich flavor.<br /><br />Taylor's is consistent; a very big deal for me; some other brands are not.<br /><br />PS: I know loose tea is "better", but I'm lazy.

review/text: There are only a few times that I drink Lapsang Souchong while I was in China, but that flavor never faded...I purchase this one based on others' review, but just find it's not the same flavor as in China. I can't say it's not good, it's just not what I used to have. For this one, you can smell that strong smoky flavor as soon as opening the package, however, from my previous experience, that smells remain very subtle until you drink the tea. Thus the smoky flavor here is too much that overwhelming the flavor of the black tea itself, which in my memory, should be mixed perfectly together. Or it can also be that what I had is loose leaf and this is tea bags.

review/text: This stuff is really good. I've been using True Lemon for a while and then I went to Canada where the grocery stores were also selling True Lime. Fell in love with the True Lime. It's great in sparkling water, plain old water, and tea. So when I saw this kit with the True Orange, I had to spring for it.<br /><br />True Orange to be honest is just okay in drinks. But where it shines is in cooking, you can put a pack or two in marinades, salad dressings,  or directly on meat just before cooking (the juices in the meat rehydrate the orange). In a foil packet with fish and vegetables, a pack of this and a splash of wine make a great quick dinner.<br /><br />Anyway for me this package represents a good value.

review/summary: Excellent Low Everything
review/text: If you're not really into Sweet sweets, you'll love these. Low everything: low calorie, low sodium, low sugar, low carb, but real Pistachio nut! Lots of Flavor. You won't be able to just eat half. But then, you won't have to. I scrutinized the "healthy" bars on five shelves in a "health" store before I found these. Most  still had tons of sugar of some kind, and high in carbs. These were the lowest. my vice of choice....the once or twice a month that I actually get a "sweet" attack.

review/summary: Pistachio + High Quality Halvah = Pure Bliss
review/text: I am a huge fan of halvah - ground sesame paste (also known as tahini), mixed with sweetening (sugar syrup, rice syrup, etc.) and molded into a desired shape (like a rectangle), then served as dessert. The great thing about Camel Halvah is that it isn't too sweet, and the pistachio nicely accents it. The little green slivers of nut add a great flavor and texture. Since this product isn't made with granulated sugar, it's good news for diabetics and those who deal with hypoglycemia. Rice syrup is a terrific sweetening, in case you aren't familiar with it. Good eats....

review/text: This halvah was a real disappointment. I had thought you can't really go wrong with halva - but I was too naive.  This "natural" halvah is greasy, rather tasteless, and with unprocessed white strands that get stuck in ones teeth. The pistachios are tasteless also and often so inedible or hard that one can only (delicately) remove them from ones mouth.  Stick to other brands of Halvah.

review/summary: Very god quality paste. Absolutely necessary for authentic Peruvian rotisserie chicken
review/text: Folks often try to make Peruvian style rotisserie chicken without this key ingredient, or substitute a combination of soy sauce and some other pepper in the paste.<br /><br />Trust me, there is no substitute for making the Peruvian rotisserie chicken that everyone knows and loves without this key ingredient.<br /><br />Panca pepper is milder than jalapeno, and less smokey than smoked Chipolte jalapenos, which is why they don't make a good substitute and only Inca's Food 'Panca' Pepper Paste by La Tienda will do.<br /><br />This jar of Inca's Food 'Panca' Pepper Paste by La Tienda is good for about six to nine chickens depending on size.<br /><br />Peruvian Rotisserie Chicken Recipe:<br />Prep Time: 20 minutes<br />Cook Time: 1 hour, 30 minutes<br />Total Time: 1 hour, 50 minutes<br />Yield: Serves 6<br />Ingredients:<br />  1 whole chicken (about four(4) to six (6) pounds)<br />  4 tablespoons white vinegar<br />  3 tablespoons white wine<br />  3 tablespoons canola oil<br />1 1/2 tablespoons of Inca's Food 'Panca' Pepper Paste by La Tienda (more if you like it spicier)<br />  2 1/2 tablespoons garlic powder<br />  2 tablespoons paprika<br />  1 1/2 tablespoons cumin<br />  2 teaspoons black pepper (resist the temptation to add "spice" by increasing the black pepper, use the Inca's Food 'Panca' Pepper Paste by La Tienda instead to get that job done)<br />  1 teaspoon salt<br />  juice of 1 lemon<br />  1 quart cold water<br /><br />Preparation:<br />Combine vinegar, wine, oil with garlic powder, cumin, paprika, Inca's Food 'Panca' Pepper Paste by La Tienda, black pepper, and salt. Mix well to form a paste. Add lemon juice to cold water. Trim chicken of any excess or loose fat. Wash chicken thoroughly with lemon water. Place chicken in zip-top bag. Pour spice paste over chicken. Coat chicken completely with mixture rubbing into every surface. Try to get the paste under the skin as much as possible.<br />Seal bag and place chicken in refrigerator for at least 2 hours. The chicken will have more flavor the longer it "marinates" in the spice mixture. Do not refrigerate more than 24 hours however.<br />Preheat grill and prepare rotisserie. Place chicken on rotisserie and on the grill for approximately 1 1/2 hours at a temperature around 300 degrees F. (150 degrees C.) Test chicken for degree of cooked by measuring the temperature in the thickest part of the thigh. Chicken is done at 165 degrees F. (75 degrees C.).<br />This chicken is frequently served with dipping sauce. A simple version of this sauce is made from combining 1/2 cup of mayonnaise with 2 tablespoons mustard and 2 tablespoons lime juice.

The small amount of oil in these chips is healthy oil. It's not really a negative. The negative is this level of salt.

review/summary: good tasting, but not really guiltless
review/text: I used to like these chips when they had 2 grams of fat, but at some point in the past year or two they have changed to 3 grams of fat. This Amazon listing still claims 2, but if you check them out at whole foods, all the Guiltless chips have at least 3 grams. Some people may say that this increase is not significant, but you can a cheap bag of fried corn chips with only 4 grams of fat (can't think of the brand, but they come in a large paper bag), so 1 gram either makes a difference to you or is doesn't and you don't need baked chips.<br />If you want low fat chips, you can get baked blue corn chips at Trader Joe's with 2 grams of fat or at Henry's Farmers Market with only 1 gram of fat. Lay's also used to make corn chips with 1 gram of fat and absolutely no oil added, but they stopped selling those a couple of years back (and Lay's current lowest fat corn chips is 3 grams).<br />These Guiltless chips do taste good, but I certainly don't taste any difference from the new version than the old ones with 2/3rds that fat content.

review/text: When this product first came out, it had no added oil and was actually healthful. But on the more recent packaging, you can see that it says, "New, bolder taste!" And what kind of chip do they consider to have a "bolder" taste? One that's more oily. The chips now have oil added (look at the ingredient list!), and it only takes 18 small chips to give you 3 grams of dietary fat. I've signaled my dissatisfaction with this (I now consider the labeling to be deceptive, because the chips are as fatty as many fried snacks) by no longer buying the product.

So most people will be able to find this without paying the Amazon price, in addition to shipping.<br /><br />But how does it taste? I loved it. I've never had other brands to compare it too, but this one has a refreshing ginger taste and bite. It is mildly sweet and very mildly salty; those are not the dominant flavors at all though, ginger is.<br /><br />BUT, the jar I bought, that looks identical to the picture here, does not contain sugar, it has aspartame (NutraSweet) for sweetness. I'm not wild about that, even though I do like the absence of sugar. I'll be looking for a sugar free, artificial sweetener-free sushi ginger.

review/text: This is the best brand of pickled ginger we have ever tried, so now it's the only one we buy. Besides eating with sushi, I enjoy snacking on it as it comes from the jar. It looks and tastes just like the kind available in fine sushi restaurants -- perfect even thin slices with just the right flavor.<br /><br />I like that it has Aspartame (Equal) as a sweeter because of the need to watch my glucose levels. Unfortunately, so many people have been taken in by controversies spread through elaborate health scares and Internet smear campaigns involving hoax e-mails. Fortunately, Aspartame is approved in over ninety countries throughout the world, so I am not worried that nay-sayers will cause it to go away. Our entire family has been using it since it was first marketed. Equal and Splenda are the only sweeteners we trust.<br /><br />On the other hand, high fructose corn syrup, which has been proven a problem for many people, is in almost all processed foods, even ones that don't require sweetening. So happy it didn't find its way into Welpac.

review/text: MY FRIEND GAVE THESE COOKIES TO ME, BUT AT FIRST I REFUSED TO EAT THEM BECAUSE I HAVE A WHEAT AND WHEAT GLUTEN ALLERGY.  I COULD NOT RESIST A BUTTER COOKIE, SO I TRIED ONE AND ONE ONLY EACH DAY.  I DID NOT EXPERIENCE AN ALLERGIC REACTION, SO I INCREASED MY CONSUMPTION TO ONLY 3 PER DAY. NOW I HAVE ONLY ONE LEFT.<br /><br />IN DESPERATION, I CHECKED TRADER JOE'S ON LINE TO SEE IF THEY WOULD BE AVAILABLE.  THEY WERE NOT AVAILABLE.  SO, I TRIED AMAZON.COM AND WAS SO HAPPY TO FIND THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE.  HOWEVER, THE PRICE IS STEEP--ABOUT $26.00 PER BOX.  BUT, I WILL PAY THE HIGH COST OF THESE WONDERFUL TREATS--I'M ADDICTED TO THEM.<br /><br />CARMEN N. IN HONOLULU, HAWAII

review/summary: These are DELISH!
review/text: When I lived on the Mainland, used to buy these all the time.  Thin, crispy, tasty, made of real ingredients without all sorts of unpronounceable additives, at least they used to be.  One of the few manufactured confections made without chocolate.  I like chocolate, but have to limit my intake.  Sadly, no Trader Joes in Hawai'i, in spite of the Hawai'i theme.  But I recall these cookies were very reasonably priced, less than $5 a box.  Aloha e kakou!

review/text: Trader Joe's Butter Waffle Cookies are a real treat for anyone who enjoys a butter cookie or a waffle cone.  They are not too sweet, are nice and crunchy (so they hold up well and taste great with ice cream!) and I think they're perfectly sized.  My entire family really likes these cookies, and we've purchased them both on Amazon and at our local Trader Joe's.<br /><br />My favorite way to eat them is with sliced bananas, sliced strawberries and whipped cream.  I definitely recommend these waffle cookies for a tasty snack or dessert!
