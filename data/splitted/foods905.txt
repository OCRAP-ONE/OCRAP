review/text: I have for years used Twinings tea, but have never tried this type.<br /><br />I found the cost very affordable, more so then in the stores.<br /><br />We didn't not like it but prefer the "breakfast tea". We did however share it with our son who drinks tea and he loved it. So there you have it one loved it the other can drink it, but prefer not. F.E

review/summary: I love this stuff!
review/text: I've got this on monthly shipping, and I usually change the schedule to get my next 24 pack a little early.  Because of debilitating migraines, I can't have sugar or artificial sweeteners, and because I used to be a cola-a-holic, I get to feeling a little sorry for myself sometimes because when I make my way through the grocery store, I realize that I can't have about 75% of what's available. I've been using Stevia for at least 25 years, but this is the first soft drink I've found using it.<br /><br />If you're still drinking/eating sugar and/or sweeteners, you may not like the taste of Stevia, but for me, it's nectar of the gods.<br />I haven't tried any other flavors in this brand yet.  The gingerale settles my stomach and tastes wonderful. Thank you, Amazon.com, for making Zevia available.

review/summary: The best All Natural Diet soda
review/text: Zevia makes the best all natural diet soda that I have ever tasted. You taste the flavor more than the sweetener. I have been using stevia in my drinks previously so the stevia taste didn't bother me. If you are not used to stevia you will find this a little hard to get used to. Stevia has an aftertaste that takes a little getting used to, but I'm so adjusted to the taste that I don't notice a difference.<br /><br />The ginger ale drink tastes like ginger ale. It's really great for when I have an upset stomach and I can't get enough of it. These drinks are great for diabetics as well because stevia can help regulate blood sugar.<br /><br />I am so happy to be able to drink ginger ale again. I have this on auto-ship since the price is excellent.

review/text: I learned about Zevia in Jorge Cruise's "Belly Fat Cure" and I love ginger ale.  So I tried it.  I am very sorry to say that it is far too sweet for me.  I have to fill it with 50% water, which spoils the carbonation.  I'm thinking SweetLeaf Stevia Ginger Ale in carbonated water might be better.  I used to make my own ginger ale from real ginger.  I think I'm going to go back to homemade.

review/summary: Best Ginger Ale ever!
review/text: Ginger Ale has always been my favorite soft drink, but I had stopped drinking it because of the sugar. Thanks to Zevia I am now enjoying great ginger ale taste again! Another big plus for me is that it is stevia sweetened. I do not use any artificial sweeteners anymore so I was really happy to see Zevia had a ginger ale. This is definitely the best Zevia flavor. I have tried all the Zevia flavors in the past and they were just ok. The Zevia ginger ale is just great! The only complaint I have is the cost. They are pricey, but I am willing to pay to get to drink Ginger Ale again. Maybe soon the price will become more affordable.

review/summary: The taste certainly lacks & it gave me gas and bloating...
review/text: I bought this product as an alternative to other diet sodas (the "big two" will remain nameless) mainly because I wanted to get away from the aspartame artificial sweetener. I've heard "bad things" about aspartame but after doing my own research on it I couldn't find any conclusive research or studies proving it was as bad as people claimed. There are tons of sites that say all these bad things it does to you, but nobody can give me a single study proving any of what they say. I tend to think this thing against aspartame is more of a conspiracy then anything else.<br /><br />But regardless, I decided to lower my intake of aspartame and try this Zevia, since it's sweetened with Stevia. The taste is certainly lacking and while it doesn't taste horrible, when comparing it to the major players in the industry - it stinks. A very bland taste and there is very little carbonation.<br /><br />Did I mention it gave me horrible gas and bloating? You know the kind that sits with you all day long and just gives you an unsettled stomach? The reason for this is that it has a sugar alcohol in it called "erythritol" and if you know anything about sugar alcohols, they almost always give you an upset stomach, gas, and/bloating. Sugar alcohols are what those sugar free, low carb chocolates have in them. And while wikipedia states that this sugar alcohol "shouldn't" be as bad as the other more notorious ones, like xylitol, because none of it "supposedly" reaches the large intestine...let's just say I would disagree.<br /><br />If aspartame is so bad for you then why is that these products sweetened with stevia cause discomfort in some people? You'd think the "bad" product would be the one where you actually notice the side effects. At $1 a can (compare that to less then 30 cents a can for other cola brands), coupled with the potential unwanted discomfort, I think you might wanna stay away from this product.

review/text: Well I was very excited because I like the Stevia plant sweetener and I figured this is going to be just as awesome. Plus I love Ginger. I love the smell of it and taste of it. Ginger is awesome. So I'm thinking that what's not to like about a drink that combines both the things I love.<br /><br />Taste: I give it 2.0 stars<br />-There is a slightly bitter after taste but it's not too bad. It does dissipate after a while.<br /><br />Zero Calories: 4.0 stars<br />-Because that's always a plus.<br /><br />Ingredients: 2.0 stars<br />-This is what killed it for me. I love Ginger but I could barely taste the Ginger at all. I would have preferred a stronger Ginger taste but maybe some of you might enjoy the hint of ginger more.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 2.5 stars<br />- I  still like the fact that there are drinks made from natural ingredients; unfortunately, I just didn't care for the taste at all.

review/summary: Ginger Ale - First experience with stevia sweetened soda
review/text: Zevia Ginger Ale was my first experience with a soda sweetened with the natural sweetner Stevia.  I'm thoroughly impressed.  I would have tried a different flavor, but the grocery store had no other flavors available.  The associate told me they sell out very quickly.  As a result of my experience with the Ginger Ale, I will be purchasing other flavors.<br /><br />Taste: 4 stars<br />- I'm not regularly a huge fan of Ginger Ale, but this soda might change that.  There is a definite after-taste that takes a little getting used to.  However, I drank my third can over a three day period yesterday, and I don't notice the after taste now.  This soda seems a tad bit sweeter than a regular Ginger Ale as well.<br /><br />Calories: 5 stars<br />- No calories!  Can't argue with that.<br /><br />Ingredients: 5 stars<br />- It's all natural.  If you aren't familiar with Stevia, look it up on your favorite search engine.<br /><br />Overall Rating: 5 stars<br />- When it comes to no calories and natural ingredients, I'm willing to accept a slight decrease in taste.  That's why I'm giving Zevia Ginger Ale 5 stars.  Hats off to Zevia!<br /><br />The only way to know if you'll like it is to give it a try.  Amazon sells these for a better price than you will find in stores, but if you want to try it first, you can probably purchase these in smaller quantity at a natural foods store.

review/summary: A New Favorite
review/text: Zevia is like an answer to prayers. I've been using stevia in drinks for quite a few years but avoid most sodas due to their high sugar content or artificial sweeteners. Finally there is a drink you can consume that won't make you feel guilty. This drink contains stevia and erythritol which is natural. I looked up erythritol in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0762435259">Eat Safe: The Truth about Additives from Aspartame to Xanthan Gum</a> and it is a type of sugar alchol derived from algae and lichens. It is believed safe in foods at low levels. As far as the taste goes it is not that gingery at all. It does seem to settle your stomach because it has ginger extract in it but it is also flavored with lemon and lime oil which makes it taste a bit like 7-Up. Anyway it is so good I drank six cans this week and feel no guilt over drinking soda. I'd suggest they leave out the lemon and lime and add more ginger.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I usually love Ginger Ale, but this doesn't taste much like it, and a look at the ingredients explains why. It contains "Lime Oil". While I don't have any problems with that as such, I do notice the lime flavor in this soda much stronger than I can the ginger. It's not bad tasting, just not as gingery as others.

review/text: I picked up a few flavors of Zevia at the health food store & I had really high hopes for this.  I also use stevia regularly in coffee & tea, so I know what the sweetener is supposed to taste like.  This doesn't remind me of stevia at all & gives a weird aftertaste.  The aftertaste just kind of sits on the back of your tongue & stays there.  The natural ginger flavor wasn't too tasty either.

review/summary: I'm not a fan of ginger ales in general, but this beverage was quite pleasant
review/text: I bought this for my sister, who likes ginger ale. I tried it myself (since I really like the black cherry, grape, and caffeine free colas from Zevia). It's quite a nice soda. Not my first or second choice--as I said, ginger ale ain't my thing--but the lemony/limeyness is prevalent enough that it pleased me. I'd drink it again if offered, though I'd prefer the other mentioned Zevias.<br /><br />This is a very nice soda line. I want to next try the orange and grapefruit flavors, and I already reordered more of the grape. I don't drink soda daily, but it's summertimes, and I do get the fizzy drink urge when it's this hot in Miami.<br /><br />Definitely worth a try if you're out to avoid aspartame/sucralose/sugar/etc, but want a more natural sort of bubbly beverage.<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/summary: Ginger Ale is one of my favorite flavors, Zevia knocks this one out of the park
review/text: Ginger Ale is one of my all time favorite flavors of Soda and I'm glad there's finally a guilt free version.  I'd learned about Zevia in April when I was introduced to Jorge Cruise's Belly Fat Cure program.  I've replaced about 90% of my diet soda habit with Zevia (I admit I like the occasional Diet Mountain Dew, even though I know it has the bad Aspartame sweetener.)<br /><br />I've lost over 70 pounds so far and it's been very easy with the Belly Fat Cure program and incorporating fantastic products like Zevia.  I feel they make their sodas with so much flavor that they're better than the regular full sugar versions. And the Ginger Ale has very strong flavor.  It's absolutely delicious.<br /><br />Ginger Ale was one of the harder to find flavors locally so when I finally did find it, I bought up four six packs because the store I found it in was about 25 miles away from where I live and I wasn't sure when I'd see it again.  So glad I bought so many at one time.

I have had this symptom before from other diet sodas, but I was surprised that Zevia, presumably just stevia, would also cause this.<br />Finally I scrutinized the ingredients and discovered Erythritol, a sweetener with a less than a good reputation. Another neurotoxin to add to my do not consume list.<br />My annoyance with Zevia is the way the packaging touts the stevia, and fails to mention the use of another artificial sweetener. I do read ingredient lists but didn't recognize the chemical name, thinking it may have been a colorant. I am not a chemist obviously, and the manufacturer's marketing of this product borders on deception.<br />It is also interesting to note that this is the same combo of chemicals used by Truvia, again with the emphasis on the more natural compound (Reb A derived from plant stevia). I am suspicious of the fact that "official" sites for these resultant products, and many medical sites, won't discuss some of the symptoms that many people are reporting through less official channels. However, almost every site specifically about insomnia that interacts with the public does list all the artificial sweeteners as a likely hidden cause of insomnia. There are other adverse side effects as well, and I wouldn't presume to know which are more common. I hope someone is studying this. The manufacturers appear to be content in ignoring these symptoms, as long as a significant number of folks don't experience it in there short term trials. We need a stronger FDA, undoubtedly.<br />Buyer Beware!<br />(btw, liquid stevia extracts that are available in different flavors, are really delicious in sparkling waters.)

review/summary: Not very good.
review/text: These are okay, but not the best and definitely not worth the hefty price. I wouldn't order these again, nor would I buy them if I saw them in a store. I usually really like Chocolate, Toffee covered almonds, but these really disappointed me. The toffee tasted only of butter and salt, the chocolate had very little flavor at all. I usually prefer to give favorable reviews, but there is no way to spin these to make them sound any better than they are, and what they are is over-priced and tasteless, and what you do taste isn't at all good.<br /><br />Hope this helps and Happy Shopping!

review/summary: I am hooked!
review/text: I tried this tea because I notice that Horace Rumpole and his wife Hilda seem to enjoy it on a regular basis.  They are fictional, but the tea is not!  I have found it to be very pleasant.  The aroma is unique and the taste is quite rewarding. Decent caffeine content as well.  I have found that making it the proper English way, in a pot with boiling water works best.  I have also made it in my cup and used (gasp) the microwave.  Either way, I am now drinking it daily and have laid in a large supply.  I also enjoy Twinings English Breakfast Tea and plan to try other varieties  of Twinings as well.  Their web site is very informative and entertaining.<br />In the meantime, I shall pop in a Midsomer Murders DVD and happily sip my Darjeeling.

review/text: This is a high quality tea.  I tried it because my grocery store was out of Twining's oolong and it stated on the box if you like oolong try DarJeeling.  The only thing I don't like is that it has a peppery zesty taste.  I like a more mellow, smooth flavor for a black tea.  No doubt many other's will like this tea because it is high quality, it is just a flavor preference for me.

review/summary: Consistently Good Darjeeling Tea
review/text: I have been drinking Twinings teas for years.  Twinings teas are consistently good.  Each tea bag comes in a sealed envelope which helps to keep it fresh.  Over a period of time, I have settled on two favorites.  These are the Darjeeling and Green teas.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4F95C">Twinings Darjeeling Tea</a>: At one time, I used Twinings China Black Tea.  Unfortunately, they stopped selling that variety.  I tried others, but chose the Darjeeling tea for an afternoon tea and snack break.  It offers a nice strong flavor and deep color.  There is enough caffeine in this tea to provide a nice lift.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4DKAS">Twinings Green Tea</a>:  There are quite a few varieties of green tea offered by Twinings. I prefer the pure green tea.  Interestingly, according to the product blurb, green tea is made from the same leaves as is black tea.  The difference is in the processing.  Green tea is lighter in color and has a more subtle taste.  In general, green teas have less caffeine than the darker teas.  I find that the Green tea is good for early evening.  It has just enough caffeine to provide some energy but not too much to keep me awake at night.<br /><br />I recommend both the Darjeeling and Green varieties of Twinings teas.

I don't know about the amount of caffeine but I bet it's on the low levels.

review/summary: Not a fan of this tea
review/text: I am not a tea expert by any means, but I drink a lot of hot teas (black, green, white, spiced, herbal, etc.) and I know what I like.  Unfortunately, I just do not like this tea.  I agree with the reviewer who said it had a sharp peppery finish, but that is about the only taste it has.  The smell of the tea reminds me of black licorice and fresh mowed grass - a nauseating combination for me, not pleasant.  Since this tea has garnered so many great reviews, maybe it is just my taster.  Also, I have never tasted any other Darjeeling teas other than this one by Twinnings to compare, so maybe I just don't like Darjeeling tea.  However, I love all the other Twinnings' teas and drink them daily (except for Oolong, but that is a different review).

review/summary: Pretty good sugar-free alternative for a Hot Tamale aficionado!
review/text: I LOVE Hot Tamales; one of my all-time favorite candies. So when I stumbled on this sugar-free gum version, I knew I had to give it a try.<br /><br />The flavor is very close to Hot Tamales. It seems as if the manufacturer took the original Hot Tamale recipe substituted the sugar for a sugar-substitute (ie sorbitol), and added a gum-base. The result is a gum that has the same type of cinnamon flavor (sweet, not peppery/spicy), spiciness level (salivating not burning), shape/color, and texture as original hot tamales; but less sweet and a bit harder to chew (at first). Don't expect this to be exactly the same as the Hot Tamales you know and love, but they're pretty tasty none-the-less!<br /><br />The price for quantity seems pretty good, and shipping was pretty fast!<br />I knocked off one star since I would have preferred a sugar-version of the gum to maintain the flavor as opposed to a sugar-free version that compromises flavor. Though, I suppose the sugar-free version allows what flavor it has to last longer... (imagine the tons of sugar-free gums and how long their flavor lasts versus sugary gums that have flavor run out in a few minutes).<br /><br />Worth a try if you enjoy the chewy candy version!

review/summary: a hot cup of comfort
review/text: A nice, medium-light strength black tea. I drink 2+ cups of hot tea a day, selecting which kind of tea by time of day, whether with food or not, kind of food, etc. I like this in the evening, black (i.e., no additives, like sugar, milk, or lemon), without food -- just a hot cup of comfort to enjoy while reading a book. It's also nice with "delicate" treats - say, angel food cake, lemon cheesecake - since it will complement the food without overpowering it. Or, when you're getting over the flu and want something hot and steamy that won't feel like it's etching your stomach lining.<br /><br />I don't know that I'd say Twinings is the best of the English teas, but I'd put it near the top. (I'm quite fond of Fortnum and Mason, but that is REALLY hard to find, even in metropolitan areas, and it's not cheap. I guess that's what happens when the vendor is known as "purveyor to the queen".)<br /><br />Here in rural MN, I can't always find Twinings, let alone Darjeeling.  So, it was nice to find this at Amazon, and at a better unit price than when I do find Twinings of any kind. A case is a lot of tea (especially since I bought cases of a couple of others!), but each bag is individually packaged, so it should keep its flavor. (And they make nice additions to a gift basket or to tuck into a birthday card.)

review/text: While this tea will not match the refinement of better loose tea, it is still the best tasting bagged tea available at a reasonable price. With a modicum of care in brewing and provided decent water, it will have a light bite and a nice flowery finish. Definitely beats anything available at my local supermarkets.<br /><br />Someone complained that it is not strong and dark. Well, it is Darjeeling, so by definition it is not dark and smoky tasting (although it sure will wake you up). For that you need Assam.<br /><br />For the price it is strongly recommended, and Amazon delivery has always been very prompt and reliable.

review/text: After having to go to the grocery store for some time to buy this wonderful tea- which they usually only have in a 20 ct box and often, they would be out of stock- I was so happy when I found it on amazon.com and at a much better price. They say darjeeling tea is the champagne of teas- while I much prefer a nice hot cup of this darjeeling tea with some cream and sugar- Twinings is really the best darjeeling that I have found and I have tried many different brands. You will really love the Twinings brand if you do try it.

review/text: I drank Twinings Darjeeling tea in Britain and loved it so I thought I was getting a good deal when I bought 300 bags at a good price from Amazon.  Now I wish I'd read the other reviews.  Apparently Twinings has a different blend for the US.  It has very little taste at all.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it's as good as anything one can find in the average US supermarket but that's not to say it's actually tasty.

review/text: While I normally drink Mariage Fr&egrave;res and Peet's Tea, to save money during these hard economic times, I have begun buying this tea in the 300 tea bag package as a substitute. This tea has a pleasant taste, slightly malty and very smooth. One tea bag can make two 8 oz. cups of tea, if one doesn't mind drinking the tea steeped to a moderate darkness. Amazon is the cheapest place I found to purchase this tea; it costs twice as much at the local grocery store. While there are much better teas on the market, overall, I would definitely recommend this tea for those who are picky about their tea, but are on a limited budget.

review/summary: Best IF U prefer it black, pure, & unadulterated
review/text: I've been drinking this tea daily for at least a year and it's just what I want in a hot drink.  When we eat out I can almost never get Darjeeling tea, which is disappointing, but I settle for various "breakfast" teas, since I have no choice.  They're close, but "no banana".<br /><br />I occasionally drink coffee, if tea's not available, but I like the way hot tea, especially Twinings Darjeeling, does the best job of cleansing my palate, without introducing a taste of its own.  Hot tea doesn't compliment EVERY food but when tea IS appropriate, I've found it does a great job of washing my food down pleasurably.  I know many prefer teas that taste like flowers or perfumes and the like (and I make no judgement about that), but serve ME "Twinings Darjeeling" every time.  It goes with just about everything and I never tire of it.

review/summary: Not for the Asians who like Dark Tea
review/text: Well, Twinnings are one of the best brands and I was hoping go for it. But this specific one is not as dark or strong as some of the South Asian folks would like to have. Its great if you are just having it without milk. But if you want to have a strong morning tea, this is not the right kind. I think the Assam blend is probably the best but I couldnt find the one I got from U.K. The flip side of Amazon order is I cant return the rest of the unopened boxes ( it comes with 6 boxes, as you know). I tried to use two tea bags on one cup of tea but it still doesnt give me the kick.... so I have to say, as much as I wanted to like it for the price and convenience, I am going to give the rest of the boxes away to freinds and family as gifts whilst I still look for that Assam blend or strong dark liqour of black tea,,

review/summary: Fantastic tortillas!
review/text: These tortillas taste great and are easy to make. The best part is that they have actual taste! They are definitely not a rubbery white rice disc like other GF tortillas I have tasted. Nor are they a large brown rice cracker! (I made the mistake of trying brown rice tortillas before I learned how sick they make me.)<br /><br />I have to be gluten free, fructose free and dairy free. These tortillas are a game changer for those of us who are gluten free but can't have brown rice because of the fructose content. My husband and I used to make Mexican food several times a week.  It was basically just our way of life before I was diagnosed with Fructose Malabsorption and a gluten sensitivity.  For the past 2 years, I have missed tortillas and Mexican food more than anything.  Finally, I can eat my steak burritos again!<br /><br />I would very highly recommend these to anyone who, like me, is constantly struggling to find something to fit into a very complicated diet with competing intolerances. The ingredients are simple but well balanced and the result is a very tasty tortilla. They don't really taste like wheat flour tortillas but they are way closer than any other rice tortilla I have had. And they are flexible and soft. I would never have guessed that this unassuming tiny brown bag would hold so much yummy goodness!  It would seem more fitting packaged in a golden bag with ribbons and balloons tied to it.  That would more accurately portray the fantastic-osity of its contents.<br /><br />Here are a few things we have learned about making these. We like to store them individually wrapped in foil and frozen. First we cook them, then allow them to cool in a Ziploc bag in the fridge, spread them out on baking sheets and flash freeze them and then individually wrap them. You can take them straight out of the freezer one at a time and toss them in the oven or on the BBQ (indirect heat or you'll turn them into crackers) and they come out warm and soft! Keep them tightly wrapped in the foil while you re-heat. They take about 3 minutes to warm up from frozen solid to warm, soft and delicious. I'm sure they do well in the microwave, too, but we haven't tried that yet.<br />The instructions say as you're cooking them to put them from the pan directly into a large ziploc bag and keep it sealed. My husband and I were pretty hesitant about that! It seems really wrong as you're making them because they're so hot right off the griddle, but do it anyway. It gets and keeps them good and moist. You can always dry them out when cooking but you can't re-add the moisture! Last, I found that putting between 3/4 cup and just a HARE shy of 1 cup of water helped to adjust for the high altitude instructions. They're really hard to roll out if you make the mix too moist so start on the dry side and add water by the teaspoon if necessary. Oh, and you'll need lots of tapioca flour to roll them out with!  We get 7 tortillas out of one bag of mix.<br /><br />The only way these tortillas could be any better is if they sold them pre-made and frozen. I would literally buy them by the case and happily pay extra for cold shipping to get them to me!  Thank you so much New Grains!  It sounds cheesy, but really, these have made a huge difference in my diet and, therefore, my life.  It's been so nice to eat a little more like I used to.  And, New Grains, PLEASE do consider selling them pre-made!  We'd be customers for life.

review/summary: Big Red Gum Contains Aspartame
review/text: For many years, Big Red and Denteyne were my favorite chewing gums.  Both had a wonderfully clean taste that helped to cover up onion and/or garlic breath.  However, I noticed an unpleasant bitter taste to the Big Red gum. Every time I chewed it, I got a bad headache. If I had more than one stick, I became dizzy. I actually fell one time. Trying to understand the reason for my falling and dizziness,  I looked at the ingredients  on the packaging of everything I was eating. Much to my surprise, there was a change in the Big Red ingredients and this gum now contains ASPARTAME.  It took me a while to put together the bitter taste with the gum.  I do not consume ASPARTAME.  I'm now trying to find a gum with real cane sugar and/or stevia.  I cannot find a single one? For more information about Aspartame, Google its side effects on the Internet. You may be surprised.

To enhance the flavor, I'm going to add some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4SHK">Hershey's Cocoa, Special Dark, 8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HK9IKG">SweetLeaf Chocolate Liquid Stevia, 2 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)</a>, and some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002H062P8">Blue Diamond Almond Breeze Milk, Chocolate, 32-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />Since the original Hershey's chocolate frosting recipe (on the old tin cans) doesn't require cooking, I think it'll be just fine to add the cocoa, 2 or 3 drops of Sweetleaf chocolate stevia, and some chocolate Almond Breeze to improve upon this basic from Pillsbury.<br /><br />I must, however, warn you that the individual serving amount (2 tablespoons) is more than enough to cause some gastric issues (as is common with the particular alcohol sugars in this frosting - believe the warning on the label); you really must stick to the serving size given.  You can have more later - it won't be the last time you have chocolate in your life.  Sometimes, denial is better than instant gratification.<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate: 16g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber: 3g<br /><br />Sugars: 0g<br /><br />Alcohol Sugars: 9g<br /><br />ECC (effective carbohydrate count) per serving: 4g

review/summary: Gas, bloating and other problems after eating
review/text: I bought this as an alternative to the regular version of Pillsbury cake mixes and while it tasted fine, I did suffer from horrible gas and stomach pains. I ate only the recommended amount, but the problems last a couple of days. I am not saying this will happen to everyone who tries this product, but my husband and myself won't dare eat this cake, nor the sugar-free frosting again!

review/summary: Tastes good, spreads poorly
review/text: I bought this product along with the sugar free devil's food cake. Both taste great, but the frosting was very difficult to spread on the cake. Even though the cake was fully cooled, the frosting ripped the top of the cake apart. Lucky for me, the kids don't care what the cake looks like, only that it tastes good.

review/summary: Gorgeous finishing salt
review/text: I have a small collection of finishing salts that I use for different things. This one is my favorite for things like salad and desserts. It's gorgeous with large crystal shapes that are very thin, some are just flakes, but other pieces are like shallow hollow pyramids. The flavor is mild and they have a nice snap which adds a textural interest to chocolates and candies.<br /><br />For more robust flavors, I prefer stronger flavored salts like smoked or Peruvian pink salts.

review/summary: Very large flakes
review/text: This has a great, fresh, finishing salt. I personally prefer Murray River Pink Salt for the more delicate crunch, but I do like this for a change. Try both!

review/summary: Beautiful and tasty
review/text: To those who believe salt is simply salt this should change a few minds. I've mainly used it as a finisher for salads and other dishes, however, in a bind had to use it in pickling as well and the results were fantastic.

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: This is the most flavorful salt you can imagine.  After you cook a nice thick steak and carve it, sprinkle a little of this salt on the cut side to make the meat pop in your mouth!!!  If you've never experimented with finishing salts, then this is a great starting point!
