review/summary: Good Quality Product
review/text: I bought this for my young son who wanted to try peanut brittle.  I looked at my local stores for peanut brittle, but could not find any.  Then I looked online for peanut brittle.  After looking at all the avaiable peanut brittle products, I found that most peanut brittle had poor reviews, due to lack of peanuts.<br /><br />Anyway, these bars are solid peanuts with just enough candy to keep it together.  I highly reccomend this product for flavor and value.  I did recieve about five bars that were broken in the 24 count case, but I break them anyway before I eat one anyway, so not a real big deal.  Another nice factor is that becouse there are so many peanuts and very little candy the bars are not break your teeth hard, they are just right.

review/summary: Planter's Peanut Bars
review/text: Mostly peanuts.  Good tasting bar without the huge amount of sweet stuff in most candy bars.  Very crunchy, not at all greasy.  Almost all bars come broken into several pieces, which is probably pretty much inevitable, I guess.  However, eating smaller pieces is not a problem unless the bar is completely shattered, which doesn't happen very often.

review/summary: My favorite snack/pack food
review/text: This is the best tasting (and probably the most healthy) peanut brittle bar ever. (Lance makes one similar.) I never much liked country style peanut brittle; too chewy, and never as pea-nutty as these are! The sugary matrix barely fits with the nuts packed so tight, so you get a highly nutritious protein (with heart-healthy vegetable fats) and 21 gram carb boost with only 13 sugars which is a good number when your on the go.

review/text: What I wanted was Lance peanut bars, and instead it showed planters peanut bars, and the wrapper looked so much alike, that I didn't even notice the brand name wasn't the same until I received it. Planters is not nearly as good a product as Lance. Guess, as with so many other things now days, if something is really good, then you can't get it anymore.<br />What a shame...

review/text: While I'm not a fan of 100% buckwheat hot cereal, I do mix it half-and-half with regular oatmeal and cook it either in the microwave or in a saucepan, and it's delicious. I also find that this mixture "holds" me longer than straight oatmeal. If you find that you get hungry too soon after breakfast, give this product a go---the price on Amazon is great, compared to what I've spent in the stores.

review/text: The serving size is 1/4 cup which sounds a bit small, but after cooking you'll find a bowl full of creamy goodness. For my tastes, as I like things spicy, this cereal lends itself to plenty of pepper and hot sauce for a kicked up breakfast. Fresh fruit is a good option as well. I also add flax seed meal for added omega 3's. The Amazon subscription option is a no brainer....price discounts and free shipping! Delicious and nutritious.

review/text: For medical reasons my children and I eat a wheat and gluten free diet. This is a wonderful hot cereal we can enjoy. I can't always find it in stores and am glad amazon carries it. Some buckwheat products take a long time to cook, but 4 minutes in the microwave is all this one takes and it tastes great. Buckwheat is very high in nutrition, including lysine, and a wonderful addition to our diet. Enjoy!

review/text: It's now gluten-free!  Others have mentioned this product was not gluten-free in the past but Bob's now claims they routinely test to make sure it remains gluten-free.  Whew!<br /><br />It is such a great option as a breakfast or side dish.  I'm from the South so I love grits and this is very similar. I know some people enjoy it with milk or fruit but I find I like it prepared as a savory dish just like grits (or polenta). I load this up with a little salt and a lot of black pepper, and I am good to go.  It has some of the same textural qualities as grits and I've even fried it up like I would leftover grits/polenta (served with some honey drizzled over it).<br /><br />Like others, I also find that if I have this for breakfast I'm not hungry for hours afterward, unlike grain-based breakfasts.<br /><br />It can be difficult to find so I'm glad Amazon has made it available in a 4-pack!

review/summary: quite tasty with cardamom, extra virgin olive oil and almond milk
review/text: Sometimes I eat a bowl of buckwheat cereal twice a day, because it's so convenient to prepare. I simply add water and microwave it for 3 minutes. Then I add about a teaspoon of cardamom (perhaps some people could do with less), about a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil and milk--any kind would do, but skim or almond is of course healthier than whole milk. Granted, cardamom is little pricy, but since I'm on a budget, I purchase it at a locale Indian grocery store. The combination is great while the calorie count is low. I pair this with Ezekiel sprouted bread, toasted, with almond butter. Very filling. Btw, I find that Trader Joe's has the best price on Ezekiel products.

review/summary: Acid/akaline balance
review/text: I am trying an acid/alkaline-balanced diet for osteoporosis. Since buckwheat is really a fruit, it should be alkaline. I mix a quarter cup of buckwheat with a quarter cup of oatmeal (acid) and add 1 1/4 cups of water. Microwave 2 minutes 30 seconds and rest 2 minutes. It is very filling and tastes good if you like bland foods, as I do. Otherwise, dress it up with sweetener, fruit, nuts, etc.<br /><br />For stove top cooking, I use a bit less than 1 1/2 cups water and cook 10 minutes, following the buckwheat directions.

Strong fruity flavor with plenty of tartness, yet without the extreme sourness that most associate with cranberry. Masks the sweetening agent well. Only two downsides- an excess of food coloring (common to most red drink mixes, apparently) which can be a pain if you're reusing a bottle. Also, poor local availability- hope that changes soon.

As soon as you wander away from wheat, finding the right balance between alternate flours to get the right consistency is a real challenge. The Cravings Place obviously invested  in R&D and figured this out. The result is perfection. My kids don't want anything else. I can't compete! We eat a lot of these for breakfast. It takes a couple minutes to prepare and 16 minutes to bake. Despite having to cut back on wheat, eggs, dairy and a bunch of other things we feel like we've upgraded our breakfast treats thanks to the Cravings Place product line. It made our kids new diet much easier to deal with.

review/summary: These are great
review/text: I love these!!!  I eat them with milk or dry as a snack. They can be a bit sweet to some, but their actual sugars are lower per serving than many cereals. I always have them in the pantry and guests seem to gravitate towards them.  There is also a recipe on line for a mixed drink with these as an ingredient. Have not tried that yet.

review/summary: Just right when mixed half and half with Cherrios
review/text: I find Cinnamon Roast Crunch a bit too sweet for my taste by itself. However, I found a way to make it just right. To make it less sweet I mix it half and half with Cheerios cereal (which has 1 gram of sugar per serving). In that mixture I find it pleasant to taste and not sugary.<br /><br />Cinnamon Toast Crunch consists of small squares of wheat and rice covered with cinnamon and sugar. Because of the rice content, when immersed in milk, one can hear "snap" sounds coming from it, similar to Rice Krispies. I love cinnamon so I always try any cereal that has cinnamon in it.<br /><br />One serving of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal (� cup or 31 g) has 130 calories or 170 calories with � cup of skim milk. A single serving has 3 g of total fat, no cholesterol, 220 mg of sodium and 45 mg of potassium. One serving has 25 g of total carbohydrates with 2 g of dietary fiber, 10 g of sugars, 13 g of other carbohydrates, 1 g of protein.

review/summary: Not for everyone
review/text: Some people like lots of sugar on their cereal - ON, not IN - so this cereal should appeal to lots of people. It also has a fairly good taste, you can taste cinnamon in there and it has a nice crunch to it. One caveat though, if you want your cereal to remain crunchy in milk, pour yourself two small bowls instead of a big one, because these bits can get really soggy. But still, good taste, but not for everyone.

review/text: The shape of the little cinnamon toasts, when heaped in a bowl, seems almost intentionally engineered to deflect pouring milk onto the adjacent countertop. Cinnamon Toast Crunch is good, but too flat.<br /><br />If this cereal were differently shaped I would give it five stars. As it stands I can only give four.

review/summary: Great gift idea!
review/text: First let me clarify one thing(not that they tried to lie to you, they didn't); "Bonsai Seeds" are no different than any other tree seed. A bonsai is not a special breed, simply an art form. With that out of the way, this product was just as described. It contained around 8 black pine seeds, some soil, pumice, and this neat greenhouse thing to plant them in. I followed the directions and 5 trees sprouted within days of removing them from the fridge. Only one is still alive (my own fault for killing them) and it seems to be thriving in the same plastic greenhouse I planted it in 4 months ago. This would be a womderful gift for young children to watch their very own tree grow for years and years.<br /><br />Tip - wait a very, very long time to transplant the seedlings to a new container. I would say close to a year. That is how I killed some of the other seedlings :(

review/summary: Can't be beat!
review/text: JUNE 2012 UPDATE: All three trees are growing strong, standing at about 4 inches tall now. I've had them in pots all winter long, sitting in my window to catch sunlight. I think they'll be ready for bigger pots soon!<br /><br />There's something to be said for growing and nuturing something from the start. I thought about buying a bonsai from my local greenhouse for $30-$45, but I like the idea of being able to shape my bonsai the way I wanted to, not follow what somebody already started. The instructions were very easy to follow, and I got three seeds to sprout! I was even able to transplant all three to their own individual pots with no problems (just make sure to go quick so the root doesn't dry out!) I highly recommend to anyone wanting to start their own bonsai, or just grow their own trees for a project during the winter!

review/summary: Good Stout
review/text: This kit has almost everything you need (including yeast and directions) to make a stout that equals Guinness and exceeds the quality of some stuff sold as stout. You add plain old store-bought sugar and water. The kit includes directions, but the directions actually make it sound as if making brew is harder than it really is. I combined the contents of the can with five gallons of pure bottled water, added sugar and the yeast that came with the kit, and mixed thoroughly (emphasize "mix thoroughly"); The directions call for hot or boiled water, but room temperature water works just as well as long as you mix sugar, yeast, and the contents of the can thoroughly. Then I allowed it to ferment at room temperature for a week. The result was a tasty, satisfying brew. You could bottle the brew after fermentation, but I pour it right out of the gallon jugs it was brewed in. The dregs stay reliably on the bottom of the bottle.  Cheers! (P.S.--no, I do not work for the company that sells this stuff. I'm just an old hippie who likes his booze.)

review/summary: Review from a novice homebrewer
review/text: First note: there is conflicting info regarding which "Brew Enhancer" that Coopers recommends be used with this particular extract. You should be using Brew Enhancer 2, which Coopers themselves recommends on their site. I used Brew Enhancer 1 based on the bum advice for this product on Amazon, and though it certainly didn't ruin the beer, it contains no dry malt extract and thus doesn't produce the mouthfeel that is traditionally associated with a stout.<br /><br />Beyond that, this is a pretty solid pre-hopped stout extract. A lot of people use it as a base for other recipes, but I just followed the included instructions for the most part. Notable screw ups:<br /><br />1) I boiled the extract. This was a mistake. Traditionally, many homebrewers insist on boiling their extract, but opinions are changing on this. You DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT boil pre-hopped extract like this one. You risk boiling off some/all of the hop characteristics. The instructions that come with the kit say only to boil the water and sugar (or the Coopers Brew Enchancer should you go that route)...follow them. They are right.<br />2) I screwed up my water temps (partially due to boiling more materials than I should have) and ended up pitching the yeast into the wort at 90F. While this is in the tolerable range for the Coopers yeast (barely), it produced strong estery (almost raisin-like) flavors. I'd recommend making sure the wort is at 70F-75F, even if the instructions say 80F is still within the "good" range, unless you want a bit of fruitiness.<br /><br />Fermentation stopped after about 9 days in the 68F-72F range. I then bottled, and just so I could try more of Coopers' stuff, I used their carbonation drops. After a week the beer was nice and carbed. Just remember to give the bottles a good turning/shake a little while after you cap them, so the sugar from the dissolved drops distributes in the bottle a bit.<br /><br />I cracked one open after that first week in the bottle. As I said before, the beer came out with strong raisin/wine-like flavors likely due to the high temperatures when I pitched the yeast (it takes a loooong time for 6 gallons of wort to cool down at room temperature!). I gave the bottles more time to sit...<br /><br />FINAL BEER VERDICT: The brew has been bottle-conditioning for over a month now, and the raisin-flavors have subsided considerably. It now *really* tastes like a dry black lager. Not great, but very drinkable. It would be a bit better if the mouthfeel and head (of which there is plenty) were a bit more stout-like.<br /><br />Again, I STRONGLY recommend anyone who goes by the included kit recipe to use the Coopers Brew Enhancer 2 or DME (dry malt extract)...NOT the Brew Enhancer 1. It should result in a nice solid stout. Also...aside from a few test bottles, give the bottled brew a few weeks at room temperature to condition. It makes a HUGE difference.<br /><br />As for the Coopers Stout extract itself, it seems like a good product and I could see myself using it as basis for more elaborate stout recipes in the future.

Many of the questions do nothing for building relationships.  For some of you, it might lead to a fight.<br /><br />The folks who developed questions for this game seem like a bunch of juveniles who don't understand the context of the game.  This game would be much better if it had positive relationship building questions instead of Beeves and Butt-head humor.

review/text: After having stacked drawers full of every treat sold on the market (Begging Strips, Milkbones, Busybone, Charlee Bear,Bonz, Carry-outs, etc.) I'd finally given up on finding a treat my dog would not turn his nose up at.  Found 'em!  These were on sale at Petco so I picked up a bag.  My dog will do anything for one of these treats.  They are great.  I've never had an issue with him throwing these up or having a reaction and he is prone to those types of things.  Not with these.  I also break them up into smaller pieces and put them in his kong.  Keeps him busy.  I've also bought the chicken balls.  He loves those too but these are the ones he really goes crazy for.  By the way, for those wondering how they taste...my husband had a chew, said it tasted exactly like beef jerky.<br /><br />Minus 1 Star for the Price because I do feel some dog treats are overpriced.  BJ's is now carrying the chicken balls but not the jerky. Petco has the smaller sized bags and the large bags.

review/summary: Horrible for dogs. Toxic ingredients.
review/text: I spent 5 years studying canine nutrition and it's because of hype marketing such as this that dogs have such increased health issues. This is created for profit rather than for pets.<br /><br />Why do I say this?<br /><br />On the label it says "100% Real"  Note that it doesn't say real WHAT.  So then you see "No artificial flavors or colors" and you think you are giving your dog real beef, right? Nope.<br /><br />Turn the package over and look more closely.  Yes, it has beef but guess what the second and third ingredients are? SALT and SUGAR. After that we have smoke flavor, potassium sorbate (an artificial preservative...note it said there were no artificial flavors or colors. It did NOT say no artificial ingredients and it did not say all natural.) then Caramel Sodium Erythurbate, then Sodium Nitrate, (Sodium nitrate, a chemical preservative) forms nitrosamines - carcinogens known to cause DNA damage and increased cellular degeneration. Studies have shown a link between increased levels of nitrates and increased deaths from certain diseases including Alzheimer's, diabetes mellitus and Parkinson's in humans, possibly through the damaging effect of nitrosamines on DNA.Nitrosamines, formed in cured meats containing sodium nitrate and nitrite, have been linked to gastric cancer and oesophageal cancer.Sodium nitrate and nitrite are associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.World Cancer Research Fund UK,states that one of the reasons that processed meat increases the risk of colon cancer is its content of nitrate. A small amount of the nitrate added to meat as a preservative breaks down into nitrite, in addition to any nitrite that may also be added. The nitrite then reacts with protein-rich foods (such as meat) to produce N-nitroso compounds (NOCs). Some types of NOCs are known to cause cancer. NOCs can be formed either when meat is cured or in the body as meat is digested...the next ingredient is then BHA. The US National Institutes of Health report that BHA is reasonably anticipated to be a  carcinogen based on evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals. In particular, when administered in high doses as part of their diet, BHA (a preservative) causes papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the forestomach in rats and Syrian golden hamsters.<br /><br />THEN ONION EXTRACT. ONIONS ARE TOXIC TO DOGS!<br /><br />It is unfortunately true that many companies add sugar as a main ingredient to treats so that dogs will crave treats...they do not brush their teeth so you are entering bacteria into their mouths on top of what is already there and this eventually actually affects their livers and kidneys. With onion ingredients you are hurting their livers and kidneys more by having to filter out this toxin on top of all the artificial ingredients.<br /><br />They are smaller than people and it's far more difficult for them to process these ingredients than it is for us.<br /><br />There are dirt cheap jerky treats for dogs that have all natural ingredients.  Don't fall for the false labeling. The very fact that they label this as they do proves what's important to them...not knowledge of getting the best for your dog, but filling it with cheap ingredients for profit.<br /><br />As someone who has studied things like this for years as well as the beneficial affects of a natural diet, this simply sickens me.

review/summary: Milo's Beef Jerky
review/text: As noted by others with (A) senior dogs and (B) "picky" dogs, my 12-year-old will just take a sniff and walk away from many "treats."  He's had some dental issues so I try to select "softer" treats and this one really does the job!  I haven't tried the other Milo's products; I'm sticking with the beef since my mutt obviously likes them.  Actually, they smell so good, I'm tempted to try a piece myself!  I would be 100% happy if the pieces were of a similar size.  Some are quite large and I cut them down to make two (my dog is a small guy) and I have a concern (as yet, unfounded) that some of the triangle-shaped pieces with their pointed end could get swallowed whole causing a problem.  Still, I stock up on this product whenever I begin to run low.

review/summary: Healthy Beef Jerky Treats
review/text: Milo's Kitchen Beef Jerky is one of the few treats I could find on the market considering my dog has so many allergies and is limited on what she can eat. So for us, the lesser the ingredients, the better. I wish I could get her the sausage and chicken ones too, but no poultry for her and no soy (in the sausage treats), so that really narrows it down for us. So Beef Jerky it is!! Another plus is that you can break them up to little pieces for training purposes.

review/summary: My all time favorite seasoning
review/text: Famous Dave's burger and steak seasoning is my all time favorite. It adds a tremendous flavor without being spicy, hot or too one noted. While Famous Dave's is a BBQ restaurant, this seasoning isn't BBQ flavored. I don't find it changes the flavor the of food at all, but just seems to make it better. It can take a bland steak and make it seem juicyer and more flavorful, as though is was an even better cut of meat.<br /><br />At the time of my writing this, there is no ingredients listed in the product info. I have a shaker of this seasoning in hand and this is what is listed as the ingredients, in order:<br /><br />Premium Contents:<br />Salt, sugar, lactose (from milk), garlic powder, maltodextrin, spices, dehydrated onion, soybean oil, hydrolyzed soy protein, corn starch, dehydrated garlic, citric acid, parsley, corn syrup solids, natural flavors, lemon juice solids,natural smoke flavor, Not More Than 2% Calcium silicate added to prevent caking<br /><br />Allergens: Milk, Soy

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I am very happy with this product.  It is less expensive than many, is of good quality and my family loves it.  It is somewhere between crunchy and smooth.  It is like smooth with some sand in it. Nicely textured and probably meets the needs of people who are picky in either direction.  It also doesn't suffer from the oily seperation issues that some do.  For kids, having to knead a pack before opening is a huge (and forgotten) hassle.  One squeeze of an unkneaded pack and shirts are ruined with peanut oil.  I do NOT miss that ugly laundry.  It is especially nice that the package is easy to open instead of needing teeth or scissors.  It is also the perfect size for one serving.  I am diabetic and peanut butter is my 'go-to' for a snack in a hurry.  I carry a pouch in my purse in case of blood sugar issues.  The pouches do hold up well to wear and tear.  I strongly recommend it.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to buy this brand due to the high price, but decided to give it a try.  All I have to say is, you get what you pay for.  It is very good and has all natural ingredients.  The separate pouches keeps the peanut butter fresh.  I keep a box in my desk at work.  I go to our work cafeteria for breakfast and bring a pouch with me for my toasted english muffin and jam.  The cafeteria peanut butter costs only $.50 but it is made with mostly hydrogenated oil with little peanut butter.

review/summary: Convenient but definitely natural and a little too oily
review/text: I love the convenience of these packets for work, but I've tried lot of natural peanut butters, and to me this one has a slightly strange taste that I find characteristic of many of my least favorite brands of natural peanut butter. Perhaps you know what I'm talking about, or maybe you don't (it's hard to describe I suppose)...That said, the taste is definitely not as bad as some (and I will not let the rest of my packets go to waste), but I will probably not be buying this kind again. (I do, however, recommend their chocolate peanut butter version).<br /><br />This peanut butter has also been very runny (due an the excess of oil it seems, which makes the peanut butter too thin--even after incessantly kneading the packet to incorporate the thicker parts well). I have to eat my rice cakes with lightening speed to keep the peanut butter from dripping all over my desk between bites.<br /><br />Instead of these packets, I will be buying the chocolate peanut butter version from now on (they don't have the strange natural taste, and they are much thicker and the peanut butter doesn't end up on my desk).

review/summary: Most delicious peanut butter ever!
review/text: The Amazon reviewers were spot on with this product - it truly is the most delicious peanut butter I've ever had!  I love the single serving packs for bringing to work for snacking with an apple or celery.  Yes, it's all natural, but as with all peanut butter - it is not a low-calorie food!  Eating this everyday isn't necessarily good for the waistline.  But I love that this is smooth and does not have an artificial sugary sweet taste.  It also isn't oily like some other natural peanut butters.  Give it a try - you will not be disappointed!

Paired with an apple or just by itself, it makes a great snack.  I am one of those people that pack snacks when I go out and this is just perfect!  I have also been packing it in my daughter's lunch as well and she enjoys them.  Peanut butter can be messy, but these packs take that away.  You don't have to knead it or anything.......is is just good to go!  I would take these hiking, biking, on the go, lunches, and snacks.  Buy these!

review/text: The peanuts are indeed high quality, so they taste better before spices are added. Really quite hot. Little pieces of the sliced chile and peppercorns are mixed in, so you'd better pay attention when you eat them or you will chew something -really- hot. Peanuts and chiles release endorphins, so I think this is a good snack if you're feeling bummed out something, too. I haven't figured out what to do with the leftover chile and peppercorn shreds but I want to.

review/text: From a human standpoint, these don't smell savory,  but my dog loves them, and I love them. He finds them tasty, and I find his breath infinitely better for having had them. He's always had trouble with tartar and bad teeth, but these do help. They aren't fatty like pig ears, nor are they "rawhide." First four contents in order: wheat gluten, modified starch, gelatin and pineapple fiber. They also come in a "mintz" option, and I prefer that style when I sniff them. The last time I looked, Amazon didn't have those. But I can't quarrel with the dog's nicer breath even with the regulars. I don't find them in supermarkets or most stores, and the one local store that carries them doesn't carry a lot in stock.

review/summary: Best veggie chili ever!!!!!!
review/text: As vegetarians, a good veggie chili is always a fantastic way for us to get lean, easy to prepare protein in a fast, hearty meal.  It is a huge staple of our diet.<br /><br />Hormel veggie chili is so fantastic and so underrated it's insane.  We have tried so many of the other brands and they are so much more expensive, and no better.  The Hormel stuff doesn't have any artificial junk in it, just straightforward wholesome ingredients, like veggies and beans and seasonings.  It's no higher in sodium, and no lower in nutrients than the other canned veggie chilis.  And it runs about $1.50 a can, as opposed to the stuff at the health food store that's always at least twice the price.  It is delicious, easy to make, ready in minutes, practically fat free, high in protein, filling, I could go on and on.  With a family of 5 vegetarians to feed having such an easy meal on hand is a LIFE SAVER.<br /><br />Obviously I know that this is a prepared food, and has a little too much sodium for it to be an everyday treat, but as far as prepared foods go I could not be happier or more impressed with it.

IMO, it's not quite as good as their meat version, but it's still good. There is a lot more tomato base to the vegetarian chili. My wife thinks the flavor is good. It could be improved with more TVP. I give it a 4 because I can identify improvements. The ingredients are all good and pass a vegetarian label inspection. I recommend it. I do wish it had more TVP though.

review/summary: very good.
review/text: This is a really good vegetarian chili -- it is heavy on the beans and has soy protein (kind of like fake meat) in it, but it doesn't really have other vegetables -- which I actually like about it. Other chilis will have these random chunks of tomatos or something in there, and that is not what chili is supposed to be at its basic form. Sure, you can add that stuff if you want it but it doesn't belong in a can.<br /><br />Anyway, this chili has a great consistency which makes it a great candidate for mixing with hot sauces. If you are like me and enjoy your chili HOT... mix your habanero or ghost pepper sauce, etc. into this. it is thick enough that you can get an even distribution. other chili's i've tried don't mix as well because they are too thin, meaning the hot sauce settles in a single area resulting in it burning your mouth off in one bite and not at all in another. this chili gets it right.

review/summary: Great Spotted Dick
review/text: I've always heard of Englands Spotted Dick, but never tried it, until recently.  We were really surprised at how good it was. We followed the prep directions, and it was really easy, quick, to serve! I will probably buy this again.

review/summary: Love These Oats
review/text: I ordered the Subscribe/Save since my family eats a lot of oatmeal for breakfast and oatmeal cookies.  They arrived quickly and were packed well with no damaged bags.  These oats have a nutty taste and are delicious.  They don't get mushy like other brands.  Will purchase again.

review/summary: Great taste and texture
review/text: If you enjoy oatmeal, these are a treat. They do have a nice flavor compared to other brands and I really like the texture. They cook to a nice chewy tenderness without getting mushy like some other oatmeal. I've liked all of the Eden brand's foods that I have tried. It seems to be a very high quality brand with integrity. The price here on Amazon is the best I've found. Cook them about six minutes, then add some organic blackstrap molasses, maple syrup and a bit of soymilk for a super tasting and very nutritious bowl of oatmeal. Much better than artery clogging bacon and eggs, with white bread toast and butter. If you do like oatmeal, you will really enjoy this brand.
