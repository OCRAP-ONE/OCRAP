review/text: Lentils are as staple of our diet, and these are great. There actually is a noticeable difference in taste from standard store bought lentils. I love that they are certified GMO free and the packaging is quaint and rustic. But, really, the flavor and the knowledge of where it came from are the biggest selling points for me, and the price for the quantity is spot on also. I will buy these again for sure.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: These are excellent lentils, from a great agricultural area. I've been to the Palouse several times, a wonderful, amazingly beautiful region of rolling green farmland in eastern Washington/northern Idaho, famous for photography, rich soil, and, well, lentils.  They even have a lentil festival every August, no kidding. When I saw these lentils on Amazon I had to try them - I belong to Amazon Prime, get free two-day shipping - and they are excellent. Like others say, they are small, firm, and really flavorful. They take more time and water to cook than most other kinds of lentils I've used due to their firmness, but retain their shape really well.  They are also chewy, not mushy, and the flavor is kind of nutty. You can do anything you want with them - make curry, soup, salad, mix them with rice or quinoa or chopped veggies, season them any way you like. I love lentils in general, other faves are red lentils (sweet and mushy, make great soup) and black lentils (tiny and round, and a great alternative to black beans) which I can get at local health food stores, but these are truly top shelf, and I've never seen them in stores. I agree with what someone else said, too, they are very clean, I haven't found any rocks or twigs in them. Just great lentils. I'm ordering a five pound bag this time so I can have them on hand for awhile - and I love knowing I'm supporting a great gem of a growing region by buying them.

review/summary: Awesome chilis
review/text: This is going to read like an ad for the company, but rarely have I been so completely satisfied by a product.  I was specifically looking for dried habanero chilis that I could grind myself for a variety of uses.  I had never purchased from this company before and was concerned that the peppers would be leathery and not really dry enough for my grinders to work correctly.  No worries!  These chilis were exactly what I was looking for.  They were perfectly dried and I was able to grind them very easily into the different consistencies that I need for my various uses (jerky, salsas, etc.)  The peppers are first rate: the flavor is awesome - the perfect habanero combimation of smokiness and buttery heat.  It is obvious that they started out with only the finest fresh chilis and dried them to perfection.  Not only that, but the delivery was faster than promised and the packaging was excellent as the peppers arrived in perfect condition.  There is no question where I will go when I need to replenish my supply.  If you need perfectly dried chilis of the highest possible quality, look no farther.  You will NOT be disappointed.

review/summary: Absolutely AMAZING. Worth the cost--you will never regret it!
review/text: I have six cats and switched to the Blue Buffalo brand six months ago, in June 2010. With six cats--all of varying age, weight and sensitivities--and not being able to afford multiple foods for each of them, it has been extremely difficult to find a single good food that works for them all.<br /><br />In June, I started with Blue Buffalo Spa Select Finicky Feast. All of my cats fell in love with the taste of this food. I was amazed by their improved appearance, energy level and overall health. It was like candy for them but, unfortunately, they ate it quick and my two most sensitive cats were gorging themselves on the food and then throwing it all up before it was digested. With Blue being so pricey I couldn't afford for it to end up in inedible chunks on the kitchen floor.<br /><br />So, I switched to the slightly higher priced Blue Wilderness Duck. Cats being carnivores naturally, this food was amazing as well. It took them a few days to adjust but once they did, their energy level shot through the roof, even higher! While the vomiting problem lessened to about 65% of before, it was still a problem. So, I gathered myself for a long sit at the computer and began researching the various types of Blue cat food all over the net from user reviews such as this one, to blogs about the cats of Blue users and even scientific studies to prove whether Blue Buffalo and other "holistic" pet foods were really all they claimed to be (and worth the high prices).<br /><br />For my research, I considered the varying ages, weights and sensitivities of my six cats. After about two hours of reading, comparing-and-contrasting and even research into other SUPPOSEDLY "good for your cat" foods such as Science Diet and Royal Canin (NOT so good--compare the labels for yourself), the answer to my six very different cats dietary needs was as clear as a bell--Blue Buffalo Longevity Adult. But I was made very quickly upset and disappointed, however, when I discovered that this variety of Blue Buffalo cat food proffers the meats and oils of three fish ( whitefish, menhaden and salmon) as it's primary ingredients. Back in the days when I fed my cats Purina One thinking it was a special "good for your cat" food I discovered that all six of them simply detested fish flavored food of any kind; probably the only dietary issue they had in common.<br /><br />So, I consigned myself to a future of Blue Wilderness Duck with lessened, though nonetheless wasteful and messy, cat vomit on my floors. It was then that I received a blessing in disguise! My car broke down exactly at the same time as I ran out of cat food. I learned that it would be three days before my car was fixed.<br /><br />And so, I had to borrow cat food from my in-laws. Unfortunately, they feed their cats a disgusting and extremely UNHEALTHY dry kibble called "Atta Cat" with ground yellow corn as it's main ingredient. I, and my cats, were devastated. They refused to eat it and went mostly hungry for three days.<br /><br />Finally, my car being fixed after three days, and I rushed out to Petsmart to buy a bag of Blue. I decided that, after three days of going hungry, orange diarrhea and unanimous vomiting I figured that maybe my cats wouldn't mind some healthy AND tasty Blue fish-flavored food. I was very nervous because I knew (or thought I did) how my cats felt about fish. Nevertheless I brought home Blue Longevity Adult and--to my shock and amazement--the three-day fast was completely unnecessary. My six cats went bananas for this food and they all began wolfing it down out of one bowl before the bowl was on the floor! I thought they might just be extra-hungry that day but their enthusiasm for this variety of Blue Buffalo dry food has not lessened a single bit--they love it!<br /><br />Not only do they love it but the vomiting has stopped altogether and my one obese cat has shed pounds and slimmed down to the muscular and energetic cat he used to be and this is a miracle! Not even the other varieties of Blue were able to do that. All of my six cats are healthier than they have EVER been.<br /><br />Let me also note here that after I first switched to the Blue Buffalo brand six months ago, all of my cats grew brand-new lustrous, velvety soft and thick coats of fur and strong, healthy musculature. Their eyes all sparkled and they had so much new-found energy--bouncing off the walls and ceilings--that I was left gasping for breath after playing with them.<br /><br />The switch to Blue Buffalo Longevity Adult has quadrupled these results as well as eliminating hairballs and reducing litter-box mass and odor to nearly zero! This food is so amazing that I almost can't believe it, myself. With all the good protein, healthy fats, antioxidants, omegas, B vitamins as well as a multitude of other vitamins and minerals, whole fruits and vegetables, not to mention Blues cold-formed LifeSource Bits that are like little multi-vitamins in the food, my cats are eating better than my husband and I and I can't help but think it's too good to be true when I see how beautiful, healthy and EAGER to eat their kibble (every morning on the dot) my cats have become.<br /><br />I cannot begin to explain how WORTH THE COST this miraculous food is. It helps overweight and oversensitive cats shed pounds and fight allergies as well as helping overly-skinny cats gain muscle mass and healthy-weighted cats to maintain--I've seen it all with my own eyes. If you have a multi-cat household and are looking for an GOOD, wholesome food that caters to them all, individually and as a group, you must try Blue Buffalo Longevity. If you love your cat or cats, you must switch to the Blue Buffalo brand. I promise--you will NOT be disappointed but delighted day in and day out with your new super-kitty!<br /><br />Go to [...] to receive a $3.00 off coupon on your first purchase of Blue Buffalo cat food. Truthfully, from a non-compensated and very happy consumer and her six cats: if you love your cat or cats, feed them Blue!

review/summary: Safe healthy food for your cat
review/text: My cat thoroughly enjoys this food, and she can be a picky eater. She would not touch the other flavors of Blue Buffalo, before they changed the shape and style of the food. But she eats the Longevity. I also feed this brand to my dogs.<br /><br />Blue Buffalo uses high quality ingredients and no cheap fillers like corn and wheat. It is all natural, with no by-product meals, which means your cat is not eating hooves and beaks. With the pet food scares recently, I am very picky about what to feed my pets. I feel that Blue is safe, especially since it is manufactured in the U.S.

review/text: My kitty is 14 years old and she started throwing up alot this spring.  I switched to Natural Balance  and it was good for a month and then she started again.  So I tried the Longevity formula and so far have had great results.  First of all, she seemed to like the taste and the transition to a new food was a breeze.  She has been on this formula for a couple of months and has totally quit vomiting (except when she eats grass of course); she had lost some weight and seems more fit and trim.  I am sooo glad and highly recommend this formula.  I will see how she does over the winter when she is less active, but for now I am greatly pleased and so is she!

review/summary: Best cat food. ever.
review/text: I have one cat and she is very picky about her food. She's not a fan of chicken based foods, turned her nose up at wet food since the kitten stage, and I wanted to feed a corn and wheat free diet. Cats are carnivores after all. I switched her to this food after one bag of specialty food from the vet's office. She has been eating it exclusively for about a year now and the results are amazing. Her coat is luxurious, teeth and eyes are perfect, small stools, and relatively no gas (a tremendous difference from when I adopted her from the shelter). She free feeds and is totally indoors so she's a little heavy but nothing too extreme at 11 lbs. The kibble size is perfect too. After having worked in a cat-exclusive veterinary clinic for many years, I've seen many high-end foods come and go. Some were better than others. This food should be more widely available, especially at grocery stores and veterinary offices. I live out 'in the sticks' and on the months I don't order a bag from Amazon I make an 80 mile round trip to Petsmart just to buy a bag of Blue Buffalo Longevity. It is worth it, hands down. Buy this food and your cat will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Definately the Best cat Food!!
review/text: We have 2 cats. One is 7 and the other is 16. We wanted a healthier food for our cats and dog so when I saw an ad in a magazine for this food I got online and researched it more. There happened to be a coupon in the paper that week so I went to our pet store to buy some. I must admit I was shocked at the price and almost didn't buy it because even with a $5.00 off coupon it is way more than I was used to spending. I am so glad I didn't back off and continue with our old brand. I saw a huge difference in the cats in just a few days. Our 16 year old cat, who normally laid around all day and couldn't jump up on our fireplace mantel (her favorite napping spot on the winter) anymore was racing through the house and playing with our other cat. She is now able to jump up on high places again. Hairballs have virtually disappeared and we very rarely have them throwing up anymore, which was almost a daily occurance in our household. I have tried a few of the other Blue Buffalo varieties and as long as they are chicken my cats love them. Sometimes I mix the Blue Wilderness with the Blue Regular for more nutrients. My only complaint is, I wish they had trial sizes because my cats normally hate any cat food with fish, but I would love to see if they would eat the Blue Buffalo kind. All in all if I could give this a 10 star I would. I know this a rating for the cat food, but we are just as pleased with the dog food. And as for the price.. you don't have to feed your animals as much because there are no fillers so for us the price evened out because I don't have to buy it as often.

Subconsciously it began a profound quest within him in the field of prevention and wellness medicine.<br /><br />In 1993, Dr. Visser was seeing about 100 patients a day at his clinic.  His clinic, Visser Wellness & Research Center is based on treating people holistically.<br /><br />As a last resort many times, moms would come in to see if he could help their children, who oftentimes, suffered from chronic upper respiratory diseases, poor nutrition, ADD, ADHD and poor or slow developments physically and/or psychologically.  Dr. Visser started noticing a pattern in these kids -  allergies to dairy, soy and high sugar products.  This started for him a journey in seeing what could be done.  With his TV show "Wild Medicine", Dr. Visser was able to travel around the world and work with some of the best minds in the fields of wellness.<br /><br />The obesity epidemic as well as the nutrient deficient children worldwide in both poor and rich countries became painfully obvious.  This is when Dr. Visser and his wife Lin and with the birth of their own child, Kai starting delving deeper into the issue.  A trailbrazer in childhood obesity research, Dr. Visser is continually on the forefront of addressing kids' evolving developmental needs and raising the awareness of proper guidance, movement and nutrition for healthy and fit toddlers and children. Through his recent clinical research on 10,000 children and the obesity pandemic, Dr. Visser has identified a great need for new nutritional options for toddlers.<br /><br />Dr. Visser embarked on the journey to fill the need for alternative options to dairy, soy, high sugar content foods for parents.  In 2000, he started actively putting together a team of healthcare professionals to develop the most innovative and nutritious product line for toddlers and children.  With the latest study findings at University of Minnesota, his own research and the guidance of FDA scientist consultants, TODDLER HEALTH product line was created.<br /><br />The product is designed to eliminate the concerns of parents with regard to the nutrient deficient eating habits and to address the obesity threat that kids face today.<br /><br />This project is from the heart.  Healthy Children make Happy Parents!  Thank you for reading "our story" and have a healthy, happy day!<br /><br />Dr. Richard Visser, Phd<br /><br />Lin Young  Visser

review/summary: A couple things...
review/text: A couple things you should know -<br />First, I do like this product and will continue to feed it to my baby. She is 18mths and I am transitioning from toddler formula to this drink. So she drinks it from a bottle.<br />It tastes fine, I mix it with water. But it is grainy, it has never fully dissolved, I might try putting it in the blender. And there is always some sludge at the bottom of the bottle, and in the nipple. You also need to use a wide fast flow nipple. And the measuring scoop is too large to mix in the bottle, especially when only using 1 hand :)<br />I have been using it for a few weeks now, sometimes mixing it 50/50 with her formula and sometimes she'll have it straight. She is fine with it but does ask for a sip or two of water after a full bottle of it straight, I guess to wash it down. Her stomach might have taken a week to 'accept' it but nothing major.<br />Overall, good product. My mom has been pushing me to get the baby off dairy... And why not when there is a drink like this out there. And I am so confident in the nutritional value I won't even refill her multi-vit once she is on this fully.

review/summary: Excellent "milk "substitute for toddler who can't have dairy & soy!
review/text: Daughter has dairy/soy issues and we were so happy when we found this! Breastfed for a year and then started to supplement with Toddler Health! She loves it and I am happy that she is getting so much Vitamins, Calcium, etc (instead of using Rice Milk which is so high in sugar)! Would definitely recommend it to any toddler over 12 months!!

review/summary: NOT a replacement for milk!!
review/text: As a nurse practitioner, I've learned a lot about infant and child nutrition. First, you must understand that children under age 2 NEED fats for their brains to develop. Brain matter is mostly fat. If babies and toddlers don't get enough fat, their neurological development will be impaired. Human breast milk is mostly fat (about 50% of calories); while the other half is milk sugars (lactose). Protein is actually a very small part of human milk. Nature naturally has saturated fats & cholesterol in mother's milk for infant mammals, as well as the yolk of egg for baby chicks. In other words, fats, particularly saturated fat and cholesterol are very necessary and healthy for a rapidly growing infant body and brain. That is why FULL FAT dairy is recommended by all doctors for every child under the age of 2.<br />Anyways, in reviewing the nutritional data on this drink, it is very low in calories, especially fat calories. I'd be concerned if parents tried to replace dairy with this drink. A child's brain and development could negatively be affected by not having enough fat. Plus a child would not get enough calories with this drink.<br />Most other countries in the world use milk for their children- not necessarily cow's milk though. I've breastfed my daughter for 1 year, and have now switched her over to goat's milk, which is recommended for children who have milk intolerances or sensitivities. The fats and proteins in goats milk are more broken down, making it easier to digest than cow's milk. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to cow's milk, I'd recommend goat's milk much more over this "rice drink".

review/summary: Fresh, Lightly-Spiced, Crunchy Kettle Chips. Good Value, Good Product.
review/text: After buying bags one at a time (at a hefty markup) at nearby stores, I decided to try bulk ordering some snack foods on Amazon. I was very pleased with the price and the products.<br /><br />These jalapeno kettle chips are not overly spicy; they have a slow-building spice that starts very subtly a grows if you eat the whole bag, which I'm embarrassed to say I did quite a few times.<br /><br />The chips arrived well-packed and fresh. They had nearly a year of time before they expired, which is pretty impressive for chips.<br /><br />Most importantly, the price-per-bag was much, MUCH better than any local store could do, although I live near an expensive city, so that may play a role in the price difference.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to order another box of these once I run out.

review/summary: Ridiculously Good
review/text: I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control.

I could still do with more vinegar flavor, but I think this is as close as I'm going to get without dousing them with vinegar powder myself.<br /><br />I did a side by side with the Cape Cod salt and vinegar and these are about twice as flavorful.  Additionally, as other reviewers have said, they have quite a good bit of potassium in them (somewhere in the neighbor of 15% RDA per serving).

review/summary: A unique flavor for fans of Thai food
review/text: These Kettle Brand potato chips in the Spicy Thai flavor really do taste like food I have eaten at a Thai restaurant. The ingredients listed include garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, jalapeno, and "spices." I'm not sure what other spices there are, but it sure tastes like lemongrass to me...yum. These chips are thick cut and very crunch. They come in a seriously heavy-duty bag. I tried to open it like I do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart; no way! The bag is so thick I wondered if it was plastic. I started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it. Sure enough, there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions "tear here." So easy. Why didn't I think of that.

The chips are crunchy, but also greasy enough that I keep a napkin near or wash my hands after eating Kettle Chips.

Just set a limit of 1 bag.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As another reviewer said, there's a lot of oil in them chips. What I do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them. Wait a few mins before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off. It seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off, but it's true! And at least this way, you'll get rid of some of the oil.

review/summary: A delicious, crisp chip with good flavor
review/text: I have always been a fan of Kettle chips.  When you open a bag of Kettle chips you know you are going to get quality.  These chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the package.<br /><br />The New York Cheddar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them.  You can taste the cheddar in them; but it doesn't smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might.  The taste lingers as well which is a definite plus!<br /><br />Another aspect about these Kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp, that crunch in your mouth.  On top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags I have had since the purchase.  The only negative I might have is that the flavoring of the chips is uneven.  Some chips might pack a nice cheddar punch while another might taste rather plain.  This isn't a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesn't ruin the bag at all.<br /><br />Overall the quality of the chips is fantastic.  The flavor is great and you wont' be disappointed , especially if you are a cheddar lover!

review/summary: Convenience at low cost
review/text: I subscribed to these - one case every three months. That comes out to about $5 a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever I want. Because it seems Frito-Lay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items I want rather than the items Frito-Lay wants me to have. The two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the Subway (for example) which I find works very well - they're large enough to be a good snack on their own, or you can even share a single bag over lunch. The size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crunchy chips are always fresh - no chip clip needed!<br /><br />The only problem? I subscribed to four cases a year and having these yummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones Kettle chip consumption. Definitely have to hide the case from the kids!

Umm, I'm in the middle on these chips, they are OK but not something I can't live without. I love the crunch, the color, NO TRANS FAT. They are a little too vinegary for my taste, which is a lot coming from a kid that grew up eating pickled hard-boiled eggs and pickled pigs feet.<br /><br />I haven't tried them with a deli sandwich and a cold mug of beer which might improve the experience :)

This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree.

review/summary: Excellent Thai-flavored chip
review/text: I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?  I don't know, but this is a well-made well-balanced chip that is addicting.

review/text: I LOVE these chips!  It is a little weird to review potato chips.  But these chips are great. The crunch is just right, plus they have just the right amount of salt. Not to salty not too bland. They are a little oily but that's ok. The best thing is the 2 oz package. When I buy a larger bag it's harder to resist eating them all.  This 2 oz package allows for a little "portion control". Be sure to use your scissors to open, 'cause these chips are packaged for freshness and don't open easily. Enjoy!

review/summary: Not quite the best...
review/text: In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice.

review/summary: One of Their Best Flavors
review/text: Kettle Chips flavors can be hit or miss.  Some of their flavors are terrible.  But this is very simple and delicious.  Probably one of their best flavors.<br /><br />Pros: Thick, crunchy potato chips with light salt that doesn't compromise on taste, eco-friendly business that isn't just giving us lip service<br /><br />Cons: The occasional burnt chip and the bag is a pain to open.  They have a tab that you can pull down but most of the time I end up tearing down the entire side of the bag.  Use scissors instead.

review/text: I'm addicted to salty and tangy flavors, so when I opened my first bag of Sea Salt & Vinegar Kettle Brand chips I knew I had a perfect complement to my vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, "...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."

These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime.

review/summary: Best sour cream & onion chip I've had
review/text: I recently tried this flavor/brand and was surprised at how delicious these chips are.  The best thing was that there were a lot of "brown" chips in the bsg (my favorite), so I bought some more through amazon and shared with family and friends.  I am a little disappointed that there are not, so far, very many brown chips in these bags, but the flavor is still very good.  I like them better than the yogurt and green onion flavor because they do not seem to be as salty, and the onion flavor is better.  If you haven't eaten Kettle chips before, I recommend that you try a bag before buying bulk.  They are thicker and crunchier than Lays but just as fresh out of the bag.

Or perhaps because all the chips in the bags I received were overcooked and that overpowered the seasoning. It is obvious the chips are flavored, but if I did not read the bag I would never have thought it had Cheddar flavor. And I love New York Cheddar. The flavoring included Parmesan, Cheddar, Blue Cheese, garlic and other spices. A good chip even when overcooked, but I do not plan to buy them again.

The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.

Since these are kettle-cooked, the chips are uniquely shaped and are sometimes a bit over-browned.  They are, however, sliced just perfectly, not too thick, not too thin, so you can actually get a great crunch with each bite without breaking a tooth off.  The flavor is tremendous, although I wouldn't describe it as Thai.  It's more of a vague, sweet and tangy flavor with a kick, and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger.  If you like any spice at all, these really are not overly spicy, so most people can handle them.  The fact that these chips have absolutely no artificial ingredients or trans fat makes them a fabulous addition to any muncher's snack cupboard.

review/summary: An indulgence with a bite
review/text: Okay, I should not eat potato chips, nor should anyone.<br />But these are so spicy, I would find it hard to eat<br />very many. That makes them an indulgence that<br />rescues some people from overindulgence.

review/summary: The best I've had
review/text: I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast.

review/text: I bought these for the office and no one can put them down. I'm ordering more today and it has only been 2 weeks. Didn't have to shop for them either, Amazon brought it to my door!

review/summary: salt and vinegar chips
review/text: It was a great value and I like the package size but not vinegary enough for me. Won't order this brand again. Great chips otherwise.

review/summary: I like them.
review/text: Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is "I like it."  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me...

review/summary: Love Kettle Chips
review/text: These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste. The sea salt ones, which are a favorite, have just enough salt to have salt but not so much that you feel like you have to drink a gallon of water with your chips.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/summary: So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.
review/text: Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...

review/summary: Love Kettle Chips, but not this flavor!
review/text: I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
