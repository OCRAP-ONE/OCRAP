review/text: The box of slim jims was received in good condition,and there where no bad surprizes. The taste of the slim jims was just what I remember from when I was a small kid over 50 years ago, although the size of the product has gotten smaller, it still tastes the same.

review/summary: Tasty snacks
review/text: I've been ordering these as part of Amazon's Subscribe-and-save program and haven't been disappointed. I'm a college student and live in a tiny room with no stove or oven, only a microwave and a small fridge. Needless to say I don't cook at home and buy a lot of microwaveable foods for when I can't afford to eat out. When I'm studying or just relaxing in the afternoon and feel like a snack between meals I'll grab one or two of these and enjoy them. I also keep a few in my backpack and car in case I ever feel hunger pangs on the go. I can't attest to how healthy they are but I can say for sure that they satisfy my hunger temporarily. They are a delicious snack and I haven't noticed a bad aftertaste as I have with other products I eat way too often. I'd definitely recommend them.

Very handy.<br />As for the quality of the snack, I would give it a 4 out of 5 stars if I could. It's pretty good. I wish they had this in a spicy version!<br /><br />Anyway, this was a sweet deal.

review/summary: Slim Jims have nothing on X-Sticks
review/text: I selected these Slim Jim sticks to try because the Jack Links X-Sticks Bacon Cheddar flavor I usually buy was out of stock. The Slim Jims have a good flavor, but they are far more greasy, and their casing is tough, like eating wax paper. They are also a bit more "dried out" in consistency. I feel that all the Jack Links sticks I have tried are much better than the Slim Jims. X-Sticks are less dry, far less greasy, and more tender to chew.

review/summary: Great snack for the troops & movie watching
review/text: These taste great, salty and meaty - they hit the spot late at night watching a horror flick or action movie with especially bad acting, but great special effects. Being single sticks in single serve wrapping they also make excellent items to put in your care package to our troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, etc. Slim Jims don't melt, go stale or wilt in the heat or at the bottom of a pack out on a march.<br /><br />Granted these things are so not health food - I mean come on... the whole point of junk food or comfort food is that it tastes great and makes you happy. Period. If you're worried about calories or sodium intake, then you need to be shopping for something all together different like lettuce or carrots. Don't slam the Slim Jim for being what it is - we all KNOW what it is... it's a greasy, fatty, salty stick of meat in a little plastic baggie made to be eaten in 3 bites with a cold mug of beer in the other hand and a bag of Fritos as a side dish.

Like all red meat, though, it's not good for you, so eat sparingly. I know meat eating is slowly declining, but here where I live, veganism is not seen. So ignore PETA's cries and take a bite out of this.

I also wish they were lower in carbs.  They can get rid of those carb fillers and up the price if they need.  That tiny bit of carb filler makes a big difference for those of us watching our carbs, and I would love to see those removed, leaving only the carbs used for flavor.  I can only eat a few in a single day because of those darn fillers.  WAH!

review/summary: Can anyone else confirm this?
review/text: I got a new batch of these tasty sticks and it seems they withered down the skin quite a bit. Even just early this yr, I had to many times spit out the skin because I just couldn't chew it enough to let it go down. I was basically chewing on it enough to get the inner "meat" out of the tough casing. Now, I can barely notice the casing and *everything* goes down much easier. I just had 2 sticks and they were yummy!!

review/text: In May of 2010 I ordered a box of Slim Jims original flavor 100 count .28 oz.<br />I opened one up and took a bite expecting a really tasty snack but as hard as I tried I just couldn't chew it.<br />It was like shoe leather. After 2 minutes of chewing I spit it out. I packed up the box and sent it back.<br />Amazon was kind enough to refund my money.<br />Next time order the Jacks Links Original .5 oz X Sticks and you can't go wrong.<br />Chuck.<br />PS: Thanks to Amazon for there customer care.

review/summary: Never quite sure what it actually is, but it is a unique taste.
review/text: There is a reason that Slim Jim doesn't ever quite say what it is.  It isn't a beef stick.  It isn't jerky.  It is what it is.  I remember eating them when they first came out and wondering what they were.  Now, tasting them again, I remember the question.  There is some kind of meat in there, but it is treated in a lot of different ways.  A Slim Jim is still as greasy as I remember, as well.  The trick is to enjoy them without eating them to excess.  For what they are, they are convenient, tasty, and can be fun.

I eat the skin and then I slowly chomp the stick until it's all gone. Then I grab another and do it all over again!<br /><br />And I don't care how many of these you'll try to eat in a week -- a box of 100 is guaranteed to last a long time! This is a good buy!<br /><br />I recommend the good ol' slim jim!

This is a great price for these slim jims. If I buy them in the store I pay alot more for them. I've tried them also & their very good. They come individually wrapped in a nice box that opens from the bottom so you can get one or more out at a time. Just like the ones they sell in the stores. If you buy them one at a time at .25C a piece you pay $25.00 dollars for them. I think this is a great value!!

review/summary: A delicious, mouth-watering meat stick!
review/text: Ever since I was a child I have loved Slim Jim Meat Sticks.  The slightly spicy juice that comes out each time you snap into one of these bad boys is enough to convert even the hardest heart.  True, they do leave a waxy residue in your mouth, and it helps to drink something with it to wash it down, but you can't deny the flavor.  The smooth, exciting design of the meat stick makes it feel good in your mouth, as there are no jagged or rough edges, as is normal in your run-of-the-mill jerky-type snacks.  Plus, they are fun to eat!  I have never had such a great time as when I'm ramming meat stick after meat stick into my mouth, and sucking the juice out of this tasty meat.  They're so much fun to eat that you can stay home all night just eating these, and still have a better time than if you were to go out on the town.  In fact, I have considered throwing Slim Jim Meat Stick parties, where all we do is gather together and eat meat sticks.  I'm entirely serious about this.  They are that good!  And with Amazon's Subscribe & Save feature, you don't even have to worry about constantly re-ordering them.  You can have them sent automatically to your house every month!  A great deal for a great snack!

review/text: Great price for the 100 count box. Each wrapped individually and the same size as usual. But I found that they were very greasy! No really what I want in a beef jerky. But they did taste good.

review/text: I LOVE SLIM JIMS. THEY TASTE GREAT AND THEY ARE GREAT FOR SNACKS. AND THEY ARE SMALL SO IT IS EASY TO CARY THEM AROUND IF YOU WANT TO EAT THEM IN A CAR,IN A PLANE,ON A BUS OR ANYWHERE ON THE GO. THE TASTE OF SLIM JIMS IS A MIX OF PEPPORNI AND AND BEFF JERKY BECAUSE THATS WHAT THEY TASTE LIKE. THIS IS A GREAT SNACK AND YOU SHOULD GET THEM.

review/summary: Get the original while it lasts
review/text: After the popularity of the Slim Jim waned in the years following revelations that the alleged "macho" of its celebrity endorser was merely spray-on tan, we endured a series of tasteless and unsnappable tinkerings to the original recipe.<br /><br />Sadly, by the early days of this century, the original recipie had been lost. Even a team of scientists hired to reconstruct the glory of Slim Jims past failed in their efforts. We feared we would never see the likes of the "skinny james" of our youth.<br /><br />Happily, a warehouse cellar of the original was located near Hoboken, NJ. How the store had gone missing more than 30 years ago is not known. But, like fine wine, these Slim Jims have only improved with age. Get yours before they're gone!

review/text: These little smoke snacks are truly a gift from God.  And I an Athiest saying this.  I have loved these heart attack causing meat sticks since I was 5.  Obviously they are not good for you.  Obviously they are made from mechcanically seperated meat, (the crap left over AFTER making hotdogs), but man are they GOOD.<br /><br />They must put nicotine in them or something.  I used to work at a video store, I found myself eating, AND PAYING FOR, these things all day.  FYI they are horrible for your skin.<br /><br />Still though I allow myself around one a month.  I will never give these up completely, and who would want to.

review/text: I have, to date, ordered six boxes of these and every one of them has been great.  A box stuffed full of delicious Slim Jim goodness. I actually couldn't ask for anything more in life.<br /><br />I worry sometimes about buying food online, but there was no difference whatsoever between these and the boxes I pick up at Wal-Mart, except that these come in at a cheaper price per stick. And that phenomenon other reviewers have mentioned, the one where you feel compelled to eat every stick in the box as soon as you can?  It's real.  And also way more dangerous with 100 Slim Jims than 15.<br /><br />(But worth it.)

review/text: ......for whatever reason, these are just too mushy.  I've gotten them from Amazon twice now and both times they've been like this.  They should be a little more aged or firm or whatever you want to call it.  It's hard to snap into a Slim Jim when it's mush.  I think I'll just stick to buying them in a store.

review/summary: The modern Slim Jim is a far cry from the original
review/text: Back about 30 years ago, Slim Jim made some DAMN fine beef sticks. They were probably the best that I can recall ever having since.<br /><br />Todays greasy orange Slim Jim is TOTAL GARBAGE, in comparison to what it used to be a few decades ago. I don't know when their recipe changed, but I think it was around 25 years ago.<br /><br />Those of you that think Slim Jims are good now would be shocked and disgusted if you were able to try the old recipe Slim Jim beef sticks. (which sadly are no longer made)

review/text: I ordered these because I wanted to try something new due to me being on a low carb diet.  I love slim jims, but these nach flavored ones are not for everyone.  Every time you take a bite, a burst of gooey, greasy cheese explodes in your mouth.  Not a sensation I enjoy.  Slim jims are greasy enough without having that extra "oomph" packed in.<br /><br />Ill give it an extra star  due to being able to bite around the cheese and eat the tasty slim jim w/ out the cheese.

review/summary: Good in moderation.
review/text: Sometimes you want a snack with a little substance (albeit mechanically seperated chicken and MSG), and Slim Jim's satisfy that craving. I polished off the box in about a month and I don't regret the purchase one bit. You probably should go easy on them if you buy them though. Whatever spicy juice or grease these things are packed with can become unpleasant if you go through more than 3 or 4 of these in a short period. I averaged about 3 a day and sometimes it was just what i needed to shut my stomach up during a boring meeting.

review/text: My Husband and his fellow soldiers love that I send snacks like the Slim-Jims because they are always appreciative of a quick, easy snack during their training exercises and on road marches. I prefer to buy in bulk, so that I know they are stocked, even temporarily. These meat sticks are thoroughly enjoyed, and the price can't be beat.
