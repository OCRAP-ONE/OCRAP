review/summary: Dear God in Heaven it Tastes Horrible!
review/text: Ok...my rating of 4 stars instead of 5 is due only to the taste (I've tried the strawberry-banana).  It does NOT taste good.  I almost have to plug my nose to down a 5 oz glass of water mixed with 1 scoop.  That being said, it is a good product.  They haven't packed it full of sugars (to make taste better) or things you might not want (creatine).  It does have the necessary ingredients you will need before and after any intense workout.  So, my advice is mix it in a blender with a banana or some yogurt to ease the pain of downing this gruel!  I had my wife try it as well......she laughed at me and would not take a 2nd sip.  I'm sure a few people might like the taste, but I would suspect that some of the 'flattering' reviews of the taste you read on here are probably spam to get you to buy it.  Anyways, it has what you need.....if u can get it down your throat!<br /><br />Update:  Gotten used to the taste.  Find myself almost craving it before and after a good workout!<br /><br />1 Year Update:  Ok.. I was probably a little harsh in my title.  When you get used to it, the taste isn't that bad.  I wanted to give some help on how to mix it.  Probably the best method would be to put it in a small blender (like a magic bullet) and do it that way.  I did this a few times, but it takes time....you have to clean up your mess, etc. so I stopped because the 5 mins. it takes to clean everything is more hassle than it's worth.  I had originally just put my one scoop in the glass filled with water and then mixed.  It probably diluted 95-98% that way.  However, the small globs that didn't/wouldn't dilute was a bit annoying.  Here is a better method:  put your scoop in the glass, have a dinner fork in the glass ready to mix it (not a spoon)-AS YOU ARE ADDING THE WATER stir vigorously with the fork until glass is full!  Not sure why, but this will nearly fully mix the protein.  I've also tried that method with a few other brands as well and it works great!  Seems to work better when I use the water from my refridgerator (the jet spout) than slow moving tap water from your sink.  GL

review/text: It's a good WPC product.<br /><br /> It's cheaper than Optimum nutrition, but it's quality is equal, if not better.<br /><br /> The taste is much better (especially chocolate) than Optimum. And it mixes very well in water. You only need to swirl couple times and there are no clumps.

review/summary: Best Whey Ever
review/text: I've used a ton of protein powders over the years and this has to be one of the best ones I've tried. I'm in college, so I oftentimes don't have time to whip out a blender to make a full fledged shake--but this powder mixes easily (and really mixes, not that clumpy stuff you get with other powders) and tastes great. In fact, it tastes exactly like cold hot chocolate. It's really fantastic and just...unbeatable. I'd give it more stars if I could.

review/summary: Awesome product
review/text: I love this stuff. Take it in combination with a carb supplement (I use Carb Slam) before and after weight lifting, and the results are amazing.<br /><br />Taking it before your workout helps you work out longer, and taking it after helps your muscles regenerate much faster. It almost completely eliminates any soreness you would normally get from lifting weights, and your muscles build up FAST.<br /><br />The first couple of months I was lifting weights, I wasn't taking any supplements. I was trying to eat more natural protein but that was it. I was building muscle for sure but was always sore for a few days after lifting and after a couple months I felt like I completely plateaued.<br /><br />Once I started taking this in combination with Carb Slam, my strength absolutely exploded and continues to consistently grow week after week, and I'm never ever sore. I cannot recommend it highly enough!<br /><br />The only downside is it doesn't really taste that great. Muscle Milk tastes 50x better. I use Muscle Milk as well, but that's more of a meal replacement type thing than a pre/post workout supplement. (Read body building forums - almost everyone feels the same way).<br /><br />It doesn't taste BAD but it's just not really that great. Hopefully they will improve it in the future, but even if they don't I will continue to use it because the results are phenomenal.

review/summary: Best whey protein I've used
review/text: I'm an old guy and I've used whey protein for a lot of years.  I tried "Complete Whey Protein Vanilla Bean" about 3 years ago and I haven't used any other brand except one time when I ran out.  That just made me appreciate CWPVB even more.  I'm in my 70's and have always stayed in pretty good shape.  I can truthfully say that my muscle mass is as good as it was 40 years ago.

review/summary: Compared to Muscle Milk Chocolate...
review/text: This product has a few advantages over the Muscle Milk Chocolate.  More protein (20g vs 15g per scoop) & fewer calories per scoop.(110 vs. 150 per scoop)<br />The flavor is not as good as the Muscle Milk chocolate powder.  It is generally lighter in texture and I think has a hint of coco-nutty flavor.  The aroma of the powder is pretty powerful to overwhelming. In my opinion, Muscle Milk Chocolate has set the bar pretty high for any/all chocolate protein powder drinks.<br /><br />The regular Muscle Milk has tons of extra Vitamins and Minerals that this Whey product doesn't have as a meal replacement (see the image I uploaded for the label). So although you could use this product for weight loss,  you wont be getting the vitamins and minerals that regular Chocolate Muscle Milk has.<br /><br />It is up to you, but you might want to email the company and ask if they can send you a sample of the product before jumping into spending a lot of money for a large container.  I am going to finish out this container, but i think I may go back to Muscle milk on the next purchase.

review/summary: New Formula? Big Disappointment...
review/text: I have used this products for 6-7 years and always loved it, until today....I ordered this from Amazon and received it a few days ago. First I noticed a new label on the tub. OK, but then as I scooped out my first scoop I noticed a color change..instead of being the color of something like Nestle Quik powder my protein was a very light shade of tan...bad sign. Still, I gave it a chance..after mixing and tasting I felt duped! Different texture and WEAK flavor - where did my rich Cocoa flavor go? I could have picked this product out of a blind test after having it every day for that many years.... the new version is awful....did I just get a bad batch? HELP.

review/summary: takes 3 scoops
review/text: If you're not big on taste, this is a pretty inexpensive product. I've tried Myoplex ($60) , ProNos ($50) and finally this stuff. I use a shaker that takes more than 20oz of water, but I used all three in this shaker. The thickest and most palatable was the ProNos it has a very rich flavor.The Myoplex and the Cytosport were on the watery side, very similar, but the Cytosport I liked the least taste-wise.  I also found that the Myo packet had over 40 grams of protein and two scoops of ProNos had the same. The Cytosport has 16 grams of protein per scoop, so you'd have to use three scoops to equal what you'd get in the serving size of the other two. The ProNos comes in a three pound tub and 19 servings per container at over 40 grams of protein.The Cytosport has 209 servings per container (divided by three scoops per 48 grams of protein = 69.6 servings) so you're getting more than three times the protein for about $25 more. Being that you can always add something to the mix better the taste, if you're on a budget, this product is very inexpensive compared to most.

Well when I first opened the container I was hit will a very pleasant sweet smell of strawberry and banana.  It made me think I was going to be eating a strawberry banana yogurt. It smelled very sweet but it isn't sweet at all. But it isn't bland either. No chalky taste. I mixed it with 6 ounces of refrigerated water and 2 ounces of 1%milk. I also added 2 ice cubes in the shaker. It helps mix it up and keep it cold.  I will be getting this again.

review/text: I was a little hesitant to buy the cocoa bean flavor after reading the reviews saying that it's not the same as chocolate, because most of the proteins I've been using are chocolate flavored.  I'm glad I ended up with cocoa bean.  I took the advice of some other comments to heat it up and it really does taste good as hot chocolate.  The other thing I like about it is that it mixes very well with water.  When I'm at the gym I don't really have a choice between water and milk, but it's not a problem with this protein.

review/summary: Quality Product that's Surpassed My Expectations
review/text: I chose this product because it's shipped quickly by a wonderful company, and the product is top notch.  In addition I wanted a protein powder that's free of all the junk, i.e.: fat, excessive calories, creatine, and stimulants.  Aside from basic whey protein, it contains a laundry list of crucial/helpful amino acids that are crucial for weight lifters, athletes, and body builders.  In addition, they've added smaller amounts of calcium, and potassium for good measure!  Of all the protein powders that I've used this one mixes the best!  Does it still cake a little bit?...The answer is yes.  You CAN mix it with a spoon but I'd still recommend a mixer.  But let's be honest, when you're trying to make protein powders dissolve easily you're working against nature.  Be that as it may, it contains what I'm looking for, tastes WONDERFUL, and is aiding me in my body building.  I'm currently enjoying Cookies 'n Creme and it's very palatable.  I look forward to trying other flavors in the future.  At 17-18 grams of protein (depending on flavor) and 90 calories per scoop I prefer mixing this with skim milk for additional protein, or doubling the dose for a larger pack of protein.  It's also convenient to have a dose an hour or so prior to working out, and making sure you get a second serving within 10-20 minutes of your completion.  Bottom line: it tastes great, and is ideal for those looking to build LEAN muscle mass without all the fat and calories.

With most proteins you only get 2 of those 3.<br />CytoSport has all of them. I will NEVER switch to another protein. too bad it took me 5 years to try it out.<br /><br />Quick breakdown:<br />-Cocoa tastes like chocolate. Some crazies say otherwise, but the planet im from, chocolate comes from cocoa. GREAT TASTE<br />-MIXES GREAT. I still cant believe how well this mixes. If you happen to not mix it all the way, any clumps present are silky smooth, not puffy and dry. its<br />really weird how it works but its great. i usually mix 1 scoop with 8oz of warm water and the other scoop with milk.<br />-Protein prices are going up, but this 5lb tub should last you a while. i give it a 4 star on the price. it could be $10 cheaper<br /><br />Do what i did and get a blender. i was tired of my shaker cup everyday. throw in a handful of fruit,yogurt,and milk. add your protein. its an INCREDIBLE shake.

review/text: My little boy absolutely loves this stuff. He has not been so excited about his food since he was a kitten. I have tried almost all the premium cat foods with little satisfaction and this one is by far the best. All I can say is keep up the good work, you seem to have found the kitty-cat magic ingredient. I am extremely pleased with your product; you have a pleased and loyal customer!

review/summary: Paws down, the best.
review/text: It took me forever to find a product that my cat could keep down (let alone touch), but after much searching and after seeing the search results for top cat food brands on about.com I decided to give Natural Balance a try. It was, shall we say, purrfect. I've even tried other high-quality products since then (including the #7 pick, Newman's Own), and Natural Balance is still the only one my cat will touch. He absolutely loves it!

review/summary: Poor Quality
review/text: I purchased this item because I wanted the tea chest.  The item description is completely inaccurate.  It states that it is a "Wood Grain" tea chest.  The chest is a cheap box that is very poorly covered with a wood grain contact paper.  I say poorly because the faux wood contact paper has ripples and bubbles all over it.  Please don't waste your money or time on this item like I did.

review/text: I received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas.  The chest is beatiful and will be great for future use; however, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea.  Although the bags are highly aromatic, the tea is very bland, as if the bags were old. I am sure Bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty, just not the box I received.

As for these Barksters, they are made with only four ingredients and all are healthy ingredients. All of my picky Chihuahua's love the treats, or I should say they loved the crumbs. I rated these healthy treats 3 stars instead of 4 stars because the crisps were all broken up and were in crumbs.

review/text: I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you.

review/summary: My Dogs Love These!
review/text: Ok, let's be honest. "Dogs will be dogs" and mine love just about anything edible,  but they go absolutely bonkers for these little crisps.  I feel good about giving them these as snacks or for training, for a few reasons.<br /><br />First, just like the box says they're "guilt-free"; made with brown rice and beef, they're wheat & gluten free, low fat and only 12 calories per treat -- so I feel good about not giving them "junk food", per se.<br /><br />Second, they're light & crispy -- like a puffed rice, so the pups aren't being weighed down by a heavy dog biscuit full of corn & sugar.  Lastly, the dogs REALLY like/crave these, so they've been a great tool for training, when I use the crisps as a positive reinforcement for good behavior.  When I'm doing repetitive action training over & over again (like teaching my one dog how to shake), I'd rather give him 10 of these than 10 pieces of hot dog or chemical-laden mushy dog snacks.  These brown rice & beef Barksters accomplish both of our needs and I'm actually rewarding him with something good for his body and his spirit.

review/summary: My Maggie Lives for Her Treatie-Time
review/text: My Maggie L-I-V-E-S for Her Treatie Time<br /><br />Every evening, after the dogs have eaten and played outside until bedtime, it turns into "Treatie-Time." Both of my girls, Lucille and Maggie, are allowed two treats, or sometimes three each if they really beg. They have to sit or down or do something special to "earn" their treatie, but it's a special time for us.<br /><br />I value my dog's health, as I'm sure you do. I want them to live a long time and have a trouble-free existence - no scratchy skin allergies, etc. Therefore, I've explored using organic treats, and have even purchased some expensive ones from a local dog bakery. I must tell you that the "girls" were underwhelmed with those treats. Despite their healthy ingredients.<br /><br />Therefore, when I was approached to review the new brand of organic treats for Barksters, I was ambivalent. Organic treats haven't been very well received in my household in the past, but I was game to try them again.<br /><br />I believe in organic treats, but if the girls don't eat them, it's really money down the drain. Especially since we're not depending upon the treats for total nutrition, I'm also concerned with treats being of the the low-calorie variety. I was horrified to learn that one of the standard biscuit-y treats contained over 500 calories in each one. That's terrible.<br /><br />As I opened the two packages of Barksters, one was Sweet Potato and Chicken Krisps and the other was Brown Rice and Beef Krisps, I was glad to see two things on the packaging:<br /><br />1.The treats are made in the good ole' U.S. of America. This is important, especially because of the recent pet deaths from pet food manufactured in China.<br /><br />2.The treats are wheat free and gluten free.<br /><br />The second is most important for my "grand-dog" Dutchy, the Siberian Husky. Ever since he's been a pup he's struggled with digestive issues. Our vet recommended that he have a gluten-free diet, which has helped him tremendously. We don't want to ruin his digestion with treats.<br /><br />As we spent the afternoon on the deck on a steamy Georgia Sunday afternoon, I broke out the two types of treats to see what the doggy reactions would be. I was surprised to see that the treats reminded me of rice cakes - very puffy - and wafer-like, instead of a biscuit. And, I must say that they were both a great hit with all the dogs. They couldn't get enough of them.<br /><br />The wafers tended to break, but that allowed me to give smaller treats more often to the group. They didn't mind if it was broken in two, that just meant two treats - Bonus!<br /><br />The treats cost approximately $10 per box which contained 5 ounces, which seems pricey. But, since it's a "luxury" item, I can go with the price. I was pleasantly surprised at how much the dogs liked these treats, especially since they didn't look like the ones they're used to getting for their "treatie-time."<br /><br />I'd highly recommend that you try Barksters!

review/summary: Amazing dog treat.
review/text: Our dogs love Barksters (all varieties), so when my friend needed to potty train her new rescue dog I recommended them to her.  They worked like a charm!  Since they only have 12 calories and can be broken into smaller bits, she could give a piece every time the dog went out.  It's hard to describe their texture.  They are puffed and crispy, but not fried.  They are crinkly like a potato chip but much thicker.  The best part is that they are all natural...oh, and made in America!

review/summary: Dog Loves it . . . While it Lasts
review/text: I bought this flavor edible Nylabone for my "industrial strength" chewing dog who's just over 1 year old.  Although he enjoys all of the Nylabone flavors, he goes through them in record time because he's a chronic chewer.  Considering how much it costs,I decided it wasn't worth it.  Instead, I now buy Purina Chewnola bones - they entertain my little guy for hours and he keeps going back to it until it's gone.  I recommend this to anyone with a dog who's into chewing.  I also recommend you buy them on Amazon since you can pay as much as 50% less than you pay at a store.  (The 3 stars is because the cost doesn't match the lasting power.)

review/text: I was hoping I was getting a tough and durable chew bone, but its just not. My 60+ lb dog bit off the end in a matter of (seriously) 2 seconds. The packaging clearly says large chunks should not be ingested, so I had to take it away from him immediately. I bought this item in hopes that it could replace the plastic chew toys made by the same manufacturer, but unfortunately, it isn't tough enough. There is a small pamphlet inside the packaging that says this size is for dogs no bigger than 50#s. I wish I would've known that prior to purchase, although a neighbor's dog (approximately 30#s) was able to bite off a sizable chunk within a few minutes too. Too bad!

review/summary: Simply Fiber
review/text: I am a senior citizen who has been eating this cereal daily for the past 4 years to ensure I am cleaned out every day. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you buy Simply Fiber over any other high fiber cereal because: 1) It really works, 2)NO Salt or Sugar, 3) High protein, 4) No preservatives. If you do not believe me read the labels on the other cereals and compare yourself. I have always exercised very hard most of my life to include the present. I lose a lot of water during my non-stop 1.5 hr daily step arobics and weight exercises. I do drink alot of water (2 liters), but I still need help from Simply fiber to ensure my regularity. I am a serious food label reader, I stay away from Sugar, Salt, Fat and eat only natural wholesome foods. No, I am not a vegetarian, but I try to be careful of the quality of the foods that I eat. I eat my Simply Fiber once a day with Non-Fat Yogurt and fresh or frozen fruit. If you do not drink any water during or after you eat this cereal you will still usually have successful bowl movement. However, if you eat liquid with this cereal you will be absolutely sure it will work for you the very next morning!!!!! This cereal really absorbs liquid like a sponge. This cereal is crunchy and has a very neutral taste (no-taste). So you can use milk, silk milk, orange juice etc. I alway add a tablespoon of almonds, frozen managos, frozen blueberries and/or strawberries, prunes, dried cranberries etc. It tastes great!!!!!!!!! Fiber One has a bunch of JUNK IN IT! I will not eat it. It is the usual processed junk with preservatives,  sugar, salt, artifical flavor, etc. "Simply Fiber is just pure plant fiber, nothing else". It tastes great and is crunchy. Note: even when I eat steel cut oatmeal I always add a few tablespoons of Simply Fiber to ensure I am regular next morning.

review/summary: UNPARALLELED HOT SAUCE!!!!!!!!
review/text: This hot sauce is one of a kind. I am always hesitant to try spicy foods because of the taste of hot sauce.. but when I tried Rocky's I was transformed. Other hot sauces seem chemically to me but Rocky's has a homey flavor that is incredibly diverse-- so much that I have been using it on eggs, tacos, as a marinade for chicken and on grilled cheese!! My family and I have been through six bottles of Rockys in the last two months. I can honestly say this is a first for our family, but certainly not the last as Rocky's has become a staple on the table for every meal. Thank You for creating such an amazing hot sauce and FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT TRIED IT: ORDER NOW!<br /><br />Original is for everything. Awesome on roasted veggies and for breakfast with eggs/potatoes. My wings are made with nothing else, really.

review/summary: Bisto is wonderful stuff!
review/text: So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these "favourite" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak "pot" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!

What a wonder flavor this gives to the pie. My family just loves it. They will make up a small batch themselves with mashed potatoes. This can be found at specialty shops around the US in British shoppes as well. Or you can order it online. Directions are on the cannister. Try it in sheppards pie!!

review/summary: Bisto Favourite is THE BEST gravy thickener in the WORLD!
review/text: Bisto is hands down the best! My mother turned me onto it a few years back and now I wouldn't think of using a white thickener (flour, corn starch) for any meat or poultry gravy again!<br /><br />What's so fantastic about Bisto Favourite is that you can make as much gravy as you want even from meats that give you hardly any drippings. Takes no time or effort at all and never ever gets lumps. You can even pour it directly into already cooking gravy. Can't do that with flour! It's foolproof. Gravy made with this always has plenty of great flavor, color and body.<br /><br />I've only tried the favourite and poultry flavors but am curious about the onion one. Personally, I don't like the Bisto for poultry flavor. I use favourite for both meat and poultry gravies. It has a lovely flavor and color that really works with everything. Just cut back on salt when seasoning the meat because the Bisto will add some.<br /><br />What I also love is that I can make a little 'quick' gravy for any leftover food that has no gravy by simply putting a dash of Bisto in the bottom of the plate, pour a little water over it. Place the meat/potatoes/whatever on the plate and microwave. When it's done the granules have melted and incorporated into the water and it is much like natural au jus. I get a nice moist leftover i/o something dry and bland.<br />I do the same thing in the bottom of the broiler pan as I cook the meat so when the meat is done, the gravy is already hot, has the drippings and just needs a quick reduction and it's ready to serve.<br /><br />You'll never fail at gravy-making with Bisto Favourite!

review/text: I love this gravy and so does my whole family.  They practically beg for any beef to be cooked with this gravy. I have grown up on this gravy all my life.  My grandmother is from Scotland and so is my mom...both have cooked with it for years.  My four sisters use it too.  I usually use the powder.  You have to mix it in a bowel first  and then add it to the stock. It can be a little difficult to use at first.  I have found that the granules are easier to use than the powder. I have not been able to find it in store shelfs so I have started ordering it online. Hope you enjoy Bisto as much as my family has enjoyed it.

I'm not sure what prompted me to buy this product on Amazon almost 40 years later but I'm always looking for quick and easy ways to enhance meals ... and Bisto definitely does what it promises, and with very few calories. You just spoon some gravy granules in a measuring cup, add boiling water and stir. That's it. I must admit, the "Favourite" flavor needs a little enhancement (mushrooms, browned onions) to end up tasting like homemade, but I love this stuff and also ordered the "Chicken" flavor. Highly recommend.

review/text: This is my favorite hot sauce.  It has nice heat (like most habanero sauces) but doesn't have that heavy vinegar or carrot flavor so many have.  It does have a tomato base so mixes well with any food that uses or blends well with tomatoes. It adds a nice punch to pasta sauces without altering the flavor much or lingering too long like other peppers.  I find it's also the perfect sauce to blend with cream/egg based items (mayo, ranch dressing, etc.) as it won't cause them to curdle or separate.<br /><br />The green version is very good too, it has a hint of garlic so you need to use it accordingly.<br /><br />If you want kick up the heat without changing the flavor of some dishes this is the perfect choice.

Also as mentioned, the green stuff is great, but is hotter still. I like the red stuff on eggs in the morning.

review/text: Got these steaks as a Christmas gift. Four steaks for 90 bucks could be worth it, but in this case it's a scam. They market these as a quality of beef you can't buy in stores but that is simply not the case. There is very little marbling in the steaks and they are Choice beef at best. But let's not forget that Omaha refuses to actually use a USDA rating for their beef. They just use fancy words to make it sound like you are getting amazing steaks when in reality if they were that amazing they would be prime cuts and labeled as such. Take my word for it and go with a company that offers USDA Prime steaks, there are plenty if you just google it. Also, last time I was at costco they actually had a good selection of Prime strip steaks at a price that is cheaper than these. The only reason I did not rate as 1 star is because 3 of the 4 steaks I received had a larger portion of filet than you typically expect with a t-bone. Still, find the prime and stay away from this low quality but well marketed beef.

review/summary: Yummy but overpriced!
review/text: Omaha Steaks shipped these quickly and the product was well packaged.  It cooked up well in the microwave when following the directions.  Broccoli & cauliflower was absolutely yummy and delicious, but I was left wanting more.  The serving size is ridiculously small considering the hefty price....and I even got it on sale. The sale price is WAY too high for the two tiny servings.

review/summary: Taste good, not worth mailing off for.
review/text: These vegetables taste good but you can save the shipping cost and buy Birdseye.  Thre is not much difference between good frozen vegetables from your local mart and this product.  No local store within two or three hundred miles and you want really good vegetables, then order them.
