review/summary: A real winner
review/text: Hubby loves the muffins for their taste, I do too but also like the ease of preparation!<br />This mix is especially good when feeding just 2, not too many leftovers that can't be eaten the next morning.<br />Of course, when feeding more, just double the packages..that works.<br />I remember years ago how messy muffin mixes with cans of blueberries were. This is far better without, to me, sacrificing taste.

review/summary: Super Easy & Tastes Wonderful!
review/text: These truly are super easy to make, and yes even a child can make them (sans oven safety concerns).  They are also cheap but it does take 3 packages to make a dozen muffins (at least with my muffin pan).  However, that's still less than three bucks a dozen!<br /><br />There are no shortages of blueberries, the taste is terrific.  You'll find yourself eating more than you planned on after these babies come out of the oven.

review/summary: Damage Package
review/text: The package arrived early; the package was damaged in delivery. The single piece of tape that was place on top of the package came off; the post office wrapped the package with some priority mail tape. The muffins were put in a box that was to large and the stuffing did not work. I received an email the same day the package was delivery saying that the post office was unable to delivery the package to me and that I would have to pick it up at the post office. The post office did delivery the package to me and has delivered packages in the past without me having to pick them up.

review/summary: Gorgeous cakes!
review/text: I used this gel on an American Star Bundt cake for Memorial day and boy, did I ever get the compliments!  The color is a true red - not the orangey-red that is shown above in the color swatch.  I used it with the blue to make a patriotic cake and it's the perfect color.  It would also serve well for other holidays that need a true blue-red like Christmas and Valentine's Day.<br /><br />This is a great product, goes on a bit gooey, but the results are definitely worth it.  LOVE the sparkles for the patriotic holidays.  Can't wait for July 4th to use it again!  Price here is a bit high - it's offered by an external seller so amazon's great prices aren't in effect.  Found mine for less than three dollars at the big store with the w in the name in case you're looking for a better price.  Great product, but it doesn't dry so be careful about putting plastic wrap over the cake - it will ruin it.  Highly recommend!

review/summary: A Great Find!
review/text: It's rare to find a condiment with both sweetness and tartness combined so well. The fruit flavors come through with a hint of ripe cranberries, and the tartness of currant, but the ginger adds a zing that makes this ideal for those wanting flavorful, fruity but not overly sweet relish. It goes extremely well with Carribean style cuisine (black beans, rice and assorted peppers in a tangy sauce; accompanied by smoked fish and roasted chicken) or with basted roasted leg of lamb and tender spring veggies (asparagus, or fresh young peas). A great find!

review/summary: Contains SPLENDA - yuck
review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: First, I LOVE the sodastream machines. They work great for sparkly water anytime you need it.<br />The syrups taste good--just like store bought sodas. But, the price for the syrup is insane! Each bottle makes the equilalent of 6 2L bottles of soda. Every supermarket I go to has 2L bottles of soda for $1 regularly--so the store bought equilent is only $6.

review/text: Just recently purchase as I like the soda taste but not the amount of sugar in Soda.  Have tried all flavors and regardless of soda, they all have the DIET aftertaste.  If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/summary: SodaStream Jet
review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/summary: The taste isn't quite right...
review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times.

review/summary: Warning, non-diet syrup contains Sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: This stuff would be pretty good if it wasn't for the artificial sweetener.  I'm not sure why they insist on putting sucralose into a product labeled as non-diet, especially after touting that it contains real cane sugar.  It does, in fact, contain real sugar.  But the advantage is negated by the unmistakable aftertaste caused by the sucralose.<br /><br />I think they're trying to keep the calorie count down by creating a "half diet" drink.  But I don't like diet drinks.  I've never had one that didn't have some sort of weird taste or aftertaste.  I don't drink a lot of colas either, but I like to treat myself to one every now and then.  So, when I do drink one, I want one with real sugar, no HFCS, and no artificial sweeteners.  I used to seek out Mexican Coke for this, and I was hoping to get a similar product with the Sodastream.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are attracted to the Sodastream by the prospect of getting a purer product.  They're going to be disappointed by the presence of artificial sweeteners in these syrups.  It's not a big deal to me because I mostly use the Sodastream to make plain seltzer, but I'm sure their syrups would sell better if they would get rid of the sucralose.

review/summary: Sodastream
review/text: After years of dealing with increasing price of soda, finding place to store it and returning  empty bottles decided to give this a try. We bought ours at Costco which came with 1-130L Co2 Carbonator, 2 1-Liter Stainless Steel Bottles and trial flavors pack for $99. First let me say I'm very pleased, the flavors are not bad at all and i can use my own filtered water from either the fridge or Pure faucet attachment and no longer need to pay or bring back bottles for the deposit. They also have much less sodium than store bought soda with the exception of Diet Rite.<br /><br /> I have tried many diet flavors and the ones i like the best are Orange, Caffeine free cola, dr pete, Fountain Mist, Cream Soda and Root Beer. As for the cost it has changed everything, no longer have to pay deposit, return empties or search for sale price on soda which means lot less trips to the store saving me from impulse buying and gasoline usage. I can now make fresh bottles of soda whenever I need it (unlike store bought soda which can lose carbonation)  and any flavor I feel like at the time. Already used up  1- 130L Co2  carbonator bottle so ordered 1 full bottle + 1 exchange for empty bottle from SodaStream web site this way I'll always have one full bottle when one is done. You should always search the web for coupons for any online store before ordering and SodaStream is no exception, saved $15 which is the price of the license on a new bottle.  So it cost me the same as if ordering to exchange 130L Co2 Carbonators, pretty sweet. If you order 10 bottles of syrup at a time you get one free  and with on line coupons and cashing in points your earn from them with every purchase can save you more than just the shipping cost, the cost of a trip to the store. For me the SodaStream is well worth the cost.

review/summary: Great flavor, and even better price.
review/text: I drink energy drinks maybe once or twice per week.  I usually stick to red bull or rock star as those cans don't overdo the caffeine and have a decent flavor.  The soda stream mix tastes very similar to rock star and costs a lot less money.  Just watch your serving size when you use the soda stream.  All canned energy drinks have a limit whereas you could drink the whole bottle of soda stream if you don't watch your serving size.

review/text: Some of the flavors we have tried:<br />Diet Cola<br />I do not like diet cola. I don't like diet Coke, diet Pepsi or diet other drinks. We bought this flavor so we could make diet drinks for someone who might like a diet cola when we were making our own soda. However, this is really one of the better diet drinks that I have tried. If you make your own soda, this is a good one to try.<br /><br />Orange<br />This is the best one by far of all of the flavors we have tried. This flavor tastes just like the fanta orange soda. We love this one.<br /><br />Cola<br />This cola flavoring is ok. It's not great. You can easily make simple syrups that will not be a cola flavor but will taste much better than this flavor. This is the equivalent of RC Cola. Ok but it's not near as good as other name brand colas.

review/summary: Splenda in every flavor...tastes horrible
review/text: Wanted the Sodastream for my birthday.  Got it, made up the first cola.  It was horrid.  Got to reading about the products.  Sodastream seems to be so proud that they did not include aspartame in their diet products, and used only sugar in their non-diet products (Instead of high fructose corn syrup).  However, they also put Splenda (another artificial sweetner like aspertame) in every flavor they make...diet or not.  It leaves a horrible aftertaste in the non-diet drinks.  The whole point of not drinking diet pop is because people don't like the taste of diet pop.  My Sodastream is going back to the company with a message stating that if I wanted diet pop I would buy it myself, and they should only put sugar in regular soda.  They brag about real sugar, and then hide artifical sweetner in every product hoping no one will notice.  It shows in the bad taste of their regular sodas, and, in my opinion, does not make them a very reputable company.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Decent Set of Flavors But
review/text: You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.

review/summary: Energy Drink vs Red Bull
review/text: I love this product.  I've heard alot about the Sodastream and finally decided to purchase one, and as I drink a lot of Red Bull (mainly as a cocktail mixer), I gave this mix a try.  Quite impressed on just how I can't really tell the difference between this Energy Drink Sodamix and Red Bull, other than the price.  On average I spend about $2.25 per can of Red Bull, and this Sodamix will yield 50 8oz servings, so easy math says $112 for 50 cans of Red Bull or $6.99 for the Sodastream Energy Drink Sodamix 16.9 Fl oz bottle and 50 8oz servings.  And as not to be biased, I have a few friends who also drink Red Bull who all agreed that it was a toss up on tasting the difference between the two products, and how much money could be saved.

review/summary: Diet Flavors are Not Great - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.

review/summary: Win some, lose some
review/text: I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.

review/text: This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it. My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present. The set up and operation is super simple. To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh. I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $.98 a liter. This does $.67 a liter. The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.

review/summary: Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days
review/text: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 "regular" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.

review/summary: My review
review/text: Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time.

review/summary: Regular Cola has Artificial Sweetener
review/text: I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.

review/summary: Great product, terrible price
review/text: I have the SodaStream and love it. I am a diet soda drinker and love all the varieties of flavors my local retailer carries. My favorite is the pink grapefruit. I came on Amazon expecting to find a deal and was shocked at the price some people are selling the flavor syrup for. HIGHWAY ROBBERY! These can be purchased for $3.99 - $4.99 (Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohls)for single bottles . I thought maybe this was the price for a double pack, but doesn't appear to be. At this price, this machine would not be very cost effective now would it?

review/summary: Ginger Ale Flavor is quite tasty!
review/text: The other reviews are correct in the fact that the "suggested" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the "three buzz" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!

review/summary: Warning - Non-Diet Flavors contain Splenda
review/text: We love our Soda Stream and usually drink the bubbly water plain or make our own syrups (very easy to do), but I purchased the Root Beer flavor on a whim. We poured the recommended amount of syrup into the carbonated water and slurped. It was OK for a split-second, THEN came the after taste - YUCK!!!<br /><br />If you are NOT of the persuasion that Splenda is natural and don't enjoy aftertaste and don't want to acquire a taste for fake sugar, then this product is NOT for you.<br /><br />From now on, I'm not buying anything without reading the label first.

review/summary: I LOVE this product, but don't buy it here....
review/text: I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs. the cost of this stuff. It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.

review/text: I'm not sure what most of you pay for your sodas, but here they run around 85 cents a liter plus deposit of .05. When one adds the $25 for 60 liters of carbonation 25/60 (.42/L) and $6 for 12 L of flavor (.50/L) one is losing money with the home carbonation system. I do like the idea of making my own products though.

review/summary: Aftertaste
review/text: I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking "fizzies" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.

review/text: Okay I am a soda drinker in some cases 1 litter a day plus. Then sodastream came across my tv screen. I was like okay it sounds great.When I found this my local store and saw the price for the unit. I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges "co2" and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull

review/summary: Some flavors OK , some questionable
review/text: Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say "WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.

review/summary: Terrible bitter taste
review/text: First, I'd like to say I'm a soda enthusiast,and enjoy a variety of brands - store brand regular brand. It's not that I can't tell the difference. I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.

review/summary: The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!
review/text: We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.

review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This cola and the energy drink are the two best reasons to invest in a soda stream maker, they taste excellent and if you only drink soda occasionally you will always have a fresh fizzy drink.

review/summary: Yuck!
review/text: I love the concept of the Sodastream, but the Cola flavor could be better, even more so when they try to compare it to Pepsi. I know with non-brands there will always be a difference, but this flavor is not good. Not horrible, but not something I will drink.

review/summary: Great for floats, but not as good as A&W
review/text: We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: Diet Pink Grapefruit Sodamix Syrup
review/text: Very, very good.  Refreshing and thirst quenching.  I Love It.  If you like Grapefruit, you'll like this drink. Just tried it in my SodaStream and it was delicious.  When you don't want sweet and you want refreshed,  this is the way to go.

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/summary: False advertising?
review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

review/summary: Price is 2.6 times as high as sodastream direct
review/text: I am in agreement with several of the users.  I can buy any of these flavors for 4.99 online, at the manufactures website.  Why would I pay 8.99 to 13.99 for the same.  This is nothing but a customer advisory.  Buy the syrups direct and save a bundle.  As for the product, its a great product.  Spending 99.00 on the machine means I have to drink a LOT of soda to equal 99.00 of sodas but it is more fun and a lot less waste.

review/summary: Tastes like Redbull, doesn't look so much like Redbull and smells a little vitaminy
review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now. Meow.

review/summary: I love it except for...
review/text: This is a great product that I enjoy daily because I can adjust the fizz as well as the strength of the taste. I have my own formula for preparing this drink to meet my personal desire and I have no problem with the artificial sweetner.  The only problem here is the value.  Amazon sells it for more than Kohl's and Kohl's sells it for more than Bed Bath and Beyond.  I look forward to Amazon having a more competitive price so I can "load-up" in the near future (hint-hint).  Either way, I like the diet Lemon-Lime Soda mix better than diet 7up. 'Nuff said?

review/summary: Great substitute for named brands
review/text: Tired of carrying cases of soda around?  This is a great substitute and easier on the back.  When you follow the directions on how to make up a batch it was a great find.  I found trying to make a calorie comparison with canned cola's more difficult than it needed to be.  They should have provided calorie information on a 12 oz. basis to match the info on a can of cola.

review/summary: Good Product misleading ad...
review/text: Thought I was saving time by buying online.  The image is of a larger bottle but in the description it is for the smaller bottler. The price was higher for the big bottle than I had previously paid at BJ's who had sold but was out last time I went to buy it there.  Buyer beware these come in several sizes. They are becoming more available so I will buy locally from now on...

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/summary: Jasmine Sambac "Belle of India "
review/text: I ordered Jasmine Sambac "Belle of India" from Thai Greenhouse on September 14, 2012 and it arrived 4 days later on September 18.<br /><br />The jasmine arrived in good condition, with the soil and rootball bound in plastic wrap and the leaves wrapped in newspaper, along with foam peanuts.<br /><br />The receipt indicates that I am to get a plant of blooming age, at 6"-8" tall.<br /><br />My plant is actually about 14" tall.  It has one woody stem with a few branches, holding about 36 leaves and showing new growth, but no flower buds.  It is a fine and healthy plant.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />As of this writing in September of 2012, Hirt's Gardens also offers the same plant at about the same price.  However, Hirt's "Belle of India" is larger and has flowers.  The one I received from Hirt's is a "full" plant, with many more leaves and stems.  Plus, it has 13 buds or little white scented flowers.  It comes in a 6" plastic container.  So Hirt's has "more plant" for about the same price.  For more details, please see "Arabian Tea Jasmine Plant - Belle of India - Sambac - 6" Pot" from Hirt's Gardens.<br /><br />~~~<br /><br />Here are directions which I pulled from the internet.<br /><br />1. Jasmines flower on new wood so prune to encourage new growth.<br />2. Minimum temperature for "Belle of India" is 60 degrees F.<br />3. Loves warm temperatures and needs full sun (not partial) for flowering.<br />4. Fertilize lightly for more flowers. Do not over fertilize.

review/summary: Healthy Peanut Butter
review/text: I must limit sugars in my diet and need to have regular protein snacks.<br />This Smart Balance peanut butter fills the requirements.  This product is "natural" in that it is mostly peanuts with few additives.  Some salt is added, mostly for taste.<br /><br />When I examine the ingredients on a typical jar of peanut butter I see extra fat and unhealthy oils have been added.  But the Smart Balance Natural is made without most of the extra ingredients.  This is the one for me.  The Taste is good. The  Nutrition is excellent.<br /><br />I recommend this product.
