review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/text: I bought this food for my dog (who has very sensitive skin), and, maybe either a) it is not for him, or, b), I didn't introduce it gradually enough, but, he did develop some vomiting and loose stools when eating (fed him only for about 3 days).  It sounds like fabulous food, with quality ingredients, but, I am afraid to give him any more, since I don't know if he can handle/tolerate it.  I still have about 32 lbs. of this food left at my house :)

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/summary: Great Balanced Choice for Dog Nutrition
review/text: When we adopted our dog six months ago, we went to both the local big box pet store and the boutique store in our neighborhood to read the ingredient labels of every bag of dog food. We knew we had to make an informed choice up front since it is so hard to change your dog's diet, especially when she is in that nervous phase between shelter life and home life. We found that the Pinnacle brand had the greatest balance of nutrition and edibility (i.e. actual food ingredients that would be easy to digest). Our dog loves it so far, it keeps well in our storage bin and all around it is nice to feed our dog something that we know is giving a solid nutritional foundation every day.<br /><br />As a side note, this food is also a great size to use for training and to put inside chew toys. We found that some of the kibble size of some of the other brands were a little too big for this sort of use.

review/text: I made the mistake of feeding my dogs a lot of people food over the years.  I wanted to get them back on crunchy food to clean their teeth, and to make sure they are getting balanced nutrition.  The problem is that they now turn their noses at even many of the better dog foods.  I got a sample of this dog food to try, and they will even eat it like dog treats.  Your mileage may vary, so it is best to try with a smaller bag to make sure that your dogs actually like it.  However, it is worth a try!

review/summary: Good 'n Sweet
review/text: Good stuff! I have a sweet tooth, and agave syrup helps me stay away from cane sugar. It's great in smoothies and just about anything else.<br />I love the taste.<br />I've learned to not use it everyday though, or for longer periods of time, as it seems to be an anti-nutrient which causes muscle cramping after prolonged use.<br />I don't have that problem with maple syrup, honey, or natural raw cane juice.<br />A little agave syrup goes a long way though because it is very sweet and not expensive and that makes it practical when preparing food for a large crowd.

review/text: This agave syrup tastes wonderful and we love the fact that it is much better for us than sugar. Now, my mother drizzles a bit on her unsweetened shredded wheat for breakfast and is completely off the sugar-laden cereals she had been eating. Sometimes, I put a bit on my peanut butter toast and I tried it on french toast instead of supermarket syrup and like it much more, plus I don't have to use as much because it is very, very sweet. I'll be trying it for baking, soon. So, we are now happy converts to this wonderful Wholesome Sweeteners raw blue agave!

review/text: I am hypo-glycemic and definitely addicted to sugar.  I have really enjoyed using this in my tea, pies, everywhere that sugars is required.  If I could fit it in my purse I would.  My kids love this as well.  They use it on pancakes and NEVER complain about the taste.  It's perfect.  It does not raise my blood sugar levels, it does not crystalize the way that honey does and it's awesome in grits.

My order arrived yesterday, and when I opened the box, I faced a sticky mess - the little foil caps placed on the opening of each bottle had popped off under the lid, and leaked all over the interior of the box.  What a mess.<br /><br />Is the product good?  Yes, and that's why I'm giving it 4 stars - I'm deducting a star for the poor packaging, and the hassle it is to deal with it!

It tastes yummy, much better than stevia in flavor. Not only does it taste fabulous, but it is a low glycemic index food, and want spike your blood sugar. It really made my hemp spirulina banana goddess smoothie really sweet. It taste as good as organic cane sugar, without being bad for you. Another plus was the excellent price it sells for on amazon, a much better bargin than my local health food stores. You can use it in or on almost anything.<br />  I also tried it on my organic pancakes this morning, and it is a delicious and healthier alternative for maple syrup.<br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Excellent, tastes better than sugar!
review/text: Trying to do everything low glycemic, this stuff is excellent.  I use it in place of brown sugar in my peanut butter oatmeal cookies.  Recipe calls for 3/4 c brown sugar, I use 1/2 c agave syrup and then add another cup of oatmeal (original recipe calls for 3c, I now use 4c).  I still have to use some regular sugar or the cookies won't bake right, but I use less there as well, it calls for 3/4 c white sugar, I use 1/2c.  The cookie fluffs up more like a muffin and it tastes great.  Overall, the white sugar is greatly minimized and the cookies are still low glycemic.  I prefer the amber version.  Tastes just like caramelized sugar syrup.  Yay!

review/summary: Tastes Great, but what is it really?
review/text: I have been using Raw Agave Nectar as a sweetener almost exclusively for a number of months now.  I am even enrolled in the automatic subscription program, however I am in the process of re-thinking my decision. First off, there is quite a bit of information on the Internet that points to the fact that agave nectar is really a manufactured  and not a naturally occurring product - agave syrup - and that it is really a form of high fructose syrup.  There is also a concern about the plant source and how it could be potentially harmful to some individuals.  This product is expensive, and if you use it regularly, you may find that you are using quite a bit even if it is sweeter than sugar.  And if you are using a lot, shouldn't you be concerned about what you are really ingesting?<br />Go to [...] for some insight into this.  Could it be that the sweetener that I have grown to love (and it tastes great - like a maple syrup substitute) and that I use primarily throughout the day in tea and in yogurt/kefir is worse for me or no better than table sugar?  Should I be frowning when my son uses pancake syrup and I choose to use raw agave "nectar"?<br />I guess the old saying still rings true - if it sounds or tastes too good to be true, then maybe it just isn't as good as it appears to be.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Firstly, the product itself - good taste, excellent sweetener, easy to use. It is sort of expensive, so I only buy it on sale. I prefer honey for most sweetening applications, but the agave nectar is actually easier to use, as it is somewhat less viscous and dissolves more easily.<br /><br />On another note, I have never had trouble with the packaging, which is often a problem with gooey liquid items from Amazon. There are seals under the bottle tops, plus shrink wrap over the tops, and the bottles also come shrinkwrapped together. As always, be careful in ordering liquid products through the mail. A rotting box of leaking goo is the bane of the delivery worker and an unwelcome addition to your doorstep.<br /><br />Thirdly, this product comes in other sizes/packaging. I recommend exploring all options to get the best price, and consider Subscribe and Save as well. We can use regular shipments here at our house anyway, since we seldom use granulated sugar.

review/summary: Misleading
review/text: Since I was looking for a truly safe sweetener I read some articles about products labeled raw agave nectar. It is actually just chemically refined fructose and no better for your system than any other sweetener natural or refined and worse than some. This was a blow to me since I found the taste really pleasing and thought, because it came from a plant and the label said it was heated below 118 degrees, that it was a cut above sugar. So far Stevia seems to be the safest but who can stand that strong taste or the expense.

review/summary: This stuff is incredible in coffee!
review/text: My mother-in-law recommended this stuff as we passed by it in costco and cause we were on a random bordom shopping trip, I bought it. So we got it home and I didn't even look at it for like a week. Then thinking that it was like some kind of sugary syrup I tried some right out of the bottle. It was simultaneously the worst thing I'd ever tasted and the best thing. My husband fully agrees with that statement by the way, so spare yourself the pain and don't eat this straight. So because of this I thought it was a total bust.  Well, I was making coffee a couple days later and we had no sugar or milk so just so I wasn't drinking my coffee black I put some of the Agave sweetener in there thinking it would taste better than it being black, but still crappy as hell. I was amazed when it tasted awesome. Now, I must say that I am the kind of person that can only stomach coffee when it is about 70 percent milk and sugar... I actually have tried my coffee half sugar and half coffee before... I still didn't like it too much. So for me to say that it made my coffee taste awesome is a big deal, a really big deal. I, uh, haven't tried it in anything else yet. I will, update when I screw up the courage to do so... :)

review/summary: Agave "nectar" is a scam
review/text: from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.:<br /><br />Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Sorry. Don't kill the messenger.<br /><br />It's easy to understand how agave syrup got its great reputation. Even the word "Agave" has a fine pedigree, coming from the Greek word for noble. The blue agave species- considered the best for the making agave nectar -- flourishes in rich volcanic soil. (It's also the only variety permitted to be used for the making of tequila.) And extracts from the agave plant have been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.<br /><br />Unfortunately there's zero evidence that any of those compounds are present in the commercially made syrup.<br /><br />Agave nectar is an amber-colored liquid that pours more easily than honey and is considerably sweeter than sugar. The health-food crowd loves it because it is gluten-free and suitable for vegan diets, and, most especially, because it's low-glycemic (we'll get to that in a moment). Largely because of its very low glycemic impact, agave nectar is marketed as "diabetic friendly". What's not to like?<br /><br />As it turns out, quite a lot.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />Fructose -- the sugar found naturally in fruit -- is perfectly fine when you get it from whole foods like apples (about 7 percent fructose) -- it comes with a host of vitamins, antioxidants and fiber. But when it's commercially extracted from fruit, concentrated and made into a sweetener, it exacts a considerable metabolic price.<br /><br />Research shows that it's the fructose part of sweeteners that's the most dangerous. Fructose causes insulin resistance and significantly raises triglycerides (a risk factor for heart disease). It also increases fat around the middle which in turn puts you at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease and Metabolic Syndrome (AKA pre-diabetes) .<br /><br />And fructose has been linked to non-alcoholic, fatty-liver disease. Rats that were given high fructose diets developed a number of undesirable metabolic abnormalities including elevated triglycerides, weight gain and extra abdominal fat.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.

review/summary: Do your research!
review/text: I just received my order, unfortunately I ordered (6).  I am so disappointed.  I only had 1/2 a bottle left of my old (different) brand and decided to order some more before I ran out.  I can't believe I didn't check the details out on this before ordering as I do take the time, normally, to do my own research on things.  Sort of messed up this time.<br /><br />Here's the thing.  This Wholesome Brand Organic Raw Blue Agave  has 16 grams of sugar in one TBL!  I called the company and learned it is under 35 on the Glycemic Index....still high.  The brand I had before had only 9  grams of sugar per TBL  (the lowest I've found yet) with a rating of 27 in the Glycemic Index and, according the the company's website, it is never heated above 118 degrees.<br /><br />Now, I'm stuck with 6 unopened bottles of this stuff and not sure what to do with it.  My fault.

review/summary: agave is unhealthy ..."low glycemic" claim is misleading
review/text: I was dismayed to learn that agave is actually highly refined fructose... worse for you than corn syrup.  I had been so pleased with it because I didn't get a sugar buzz and though that was a positive thing. Do an internet search for article entitiled for agave-nectar-hfcs-in-disguise. Here's a quote:<br /><br />Yucca species, together with other agaves, are known to contain large quantities of saponins, according to Tyler's Honest Herbal. Saponins in many varieties of agave plants are toxic steroid derivatives, as well as purgatives, and are to be avoided during pregnancy or breastfeeding because they might cause or contribute to miscarriage. These toxins have adverse effects on non-pregnant people and many health compromised consumer categories as well. They are known to contribute to internal hemorrhaging by destroying red blood cells, and they may gravely negatively harm people taking statin and high blood pressure drugs. Agave may also stimulate blood flow in the uterus.(10) Other first hand reports indicate agave may promote sterility in women. Since the agaves used for agave syrup are not being used in their traditional way, there should be a warning label on the sweetener packages that it may promote miscarriage during pregnancy, through weakening the uterine lining.<br /><br />What's Wrong With Fructose?<br /><br />Once eaten, refined fructose appears as triglycerides in the blood stream, or as stored body fat. Elevated triglyceride levels, caused by consumption of refined fructose, are building blocks for hardening human arteries. Metabolic studies have proven the relationship between refined fructose and obesity.(11) Because fructose is not converted to blood glucose, refined fructose doesn't raise nor crash human blood glucose levels -- hence the claim that it is safe for diabetics. Supposedly, refined fructose has a low glycemic index, and won't affect your blood sugar negatively. But the food labels are deceptive. Refined fructose is not really safe for diabetics. "High fructose from agave or corn will kill a diabetic or hypoglycemic much faster than refined white sugar," says Mr. Bianchi. "By eating high fructose syrups, you are clogging the veins, creating inflammation, and increasing body fat, while stressing your heart. This is in part because refined fructose is foreign to the body, and is not recognized by it.<br /><br />So sad.

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: This tastes great, I love it in my coffee, and have even used it for pancakes.  It really doesn't give me a spike in blood sugar, as promised.  The only negative is the packaging they are using.  During shipping, some of the seals underneath the lids came off, and the bottles leaked.  I probably lost about a tablespoon (each) from 3 of the 6 bottles.  The lids don't really fit the bottles, either.  They have a pop-top, but if you use it, the syrup sometimes leakes out from under the lid where it attaches to the bottle.  If they could fix the bottles, this would definitely be a five-star product.<br /><br />**Update**  The product was not available for a few months, and when it came back--NEW PACKAGING!!  My last shipment was sealed up tight.  Five Stars for sure, but Amazon won't let me change that part.

review/summary: Best quality agave currently available
review/text: Over the years I've done bulk buying for a housing cooperative and have dealt with wholesome sweeteners before - they sell everything from sucanat to organic corn syrup (blech). A lot of the other agave stuff on the market right now is simply from resellers trying to make a buck moving high margin natural foods products - this stuff is from a company that specializes in selling sweeteners and has a reputation for quality. You can't really beat it.<br /><br />Uses: This stuff is perfect for tea - just a little bit takes the bitter edge off most black / green teas without overwhelming the flavor - and for making raw sweets. A lot of people like to use this stuff for baking, but I find it a bit expensive for this use - honey is cheaper and more readily available. This stuff is really healthy, but has to travel a lot of miles and uses a lot of packaging where both honey and maple syrup can be found locally in gallon jugs depending on where you live. Our coop actually buys honey in 60lb jugs :)<br /><br />Note: Different companies advertise widely ranging glycemic index values for their agave syrups - enough so to make your head spin at how they could be so widely different for what appears to be the same product. Wholesome Sweeteners advertises 39 or less on their site, which is believable, where some companies advertise values as low as 21 with no analysis to back their claims up. To give you an idea of how this stuff compares glycemic index wise both honey & maple syrup have glycemic indexes around 55, corn syrup's is around 100, and white sugar's is around 110(!).

review/summary: PLEASE I implore you to do research before buying Blue Agave!
review/text: Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food.<br /><br />Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as High Fructose Corn Syrup!!!!<br /><br />Based on the labeling, I could picture native peoples creating their own agave nectar from the wild agave plants. Surely, this was a traditional food, eaten for thousands of years. Sadly, it is not.<br /><br />Native Mexican peoples do make a sort of sweetener out of the agave plant. It's called miel de agave, and it's made by boiling the agave sap for a couple of hours. Think of it as the Mexican version of authentic Canadian maple syrup.<br /><br />But this is not what agave nectar is. According to one popular agave nectar manufacturer, "Agave nectar is a newly created sweetener, having been developed in the 1990s." In a recent article now posted on the Weston A. Price foundation's website, Ramiel Nagel and Sally Fallon Morell write,<br /><br />Agave "nectar" is not made from the sap of the yucca or agave plant but from the starch of the giant pineapple-like, root bulb. The principal constituent of the agave root is starch, similar to the starch in corn or rice, and a complex carbohydrate called inulin, which is made up of chains of fructose molecules.Technically a highly indigestible fiber, inulin, which does not taste sweet, comprises about half of the carbohydrate content of agave.<br /><br />The process by which agave glucose and inulin are converted into "nectar" is similar to the process by which corn starch is converted into HFCS. The agave starch is subject to an enzymatic and chemical process that converts the starch into a fructose-rich syrup--anywhere from 70 percent fructose and higher according to the agave nectar chemical profiles posted on agave nectar websites.<br /><br />"Agave syrup is almost all fructose, highly processed sugar with great marketing," said Dr. Ingrid Kohlstadt, a fellow of the American College of Nutrition and an associate faculty member at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. "Fructose interferes with healthy metabolism when (consumed) at higher doses", she told me. "Many people have fructose intolerance like lactose intolerance. They get acne or worse diabetes symptoms even though their blood [sugar] is OK".<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS.<br /><br />Info is taken from Jonny Bowden, PhD, C.N.S.<br /><br />So please. I implore each and every one of you to do your own research on this sham of a product and tell everyone you know. Write letters and let the world know that we won't fall prey to loopholes in "Organic Marketing". The fact that so many people use this because they are diabetic is quite frightening.

review/summary: Great for diabetics!
review/text: I am a type 2 diabetic who was looking to cut out all the unhealthy fake sweeteners from my diet. (i.e. Splenda, Equal, etc.) I did settle upon Stevia for a while, but I did not have desirable results when baking with it. My requirement was to find an all-natural sweetner safe enough for diabetics that would also hold up well in my favorite backed goods. I saw a bottle of this stuff at the health food store, and thought I would try it whith the condition that I would obsessively check my blood sugars on my monitor to make sure it was indeed low gycemic as the label indicates. I am happy to report that used in *moderation* I have not noticed any effects on my blood sugar levels.  (Do not go overboard with this stuff because it can and does affect blood suagr levels. Your blood sugar just won't "spike" like with white table sugar. )I use small to moderate amounts in coffee, on pancakes, in baked goods, etc, and it does seem to be safe for my blood sugar levels. I bought a bottle each for my diabetic insulin-dependent mother and aunt, and they both have also reported when used in moderation, they do not notice a rise in blood sugar levels, either.<br /><br />All in all, if you are diabetic, hypoglycemic, or are sensitive to white sugar, you should give this stuff a try to see if it will be as successful for you as it has been for me. I highly recommend this stuff to any diabetic out there wanting an all-natural alternative to fake, chemical sweeteners.<br /><br />Hint: I do use Stevia in my coffee and tea in conjunction with agave. The agave and stevia seem to bring out the best in each other and complement each other well in my favorite hot beverages. Using the stevia in conjunction with this helps me use less agave then I normally would, which has an even lesser effect on my blood sugars. And, the slightly bitter taste from Stevia seems to be neutralized when used with the agave.

At first, I didn't care for the flavor, especially in coffee. It is a bit like honey, and I never, ever put honey in my coffee. However, it is absolutely dynamite in any tea -- black, white, berry, lemon... It's GREAT in tea! Actually, I've found myself drinking tea much more often because of it, and for me, anyway, this is a double health benefit.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Love the taste; don't love the packaging!
review/text: I've been using this syrup for almost a year. I really love the taste of this product; no funny aftertaste like some sweeteners. It's rich and thick, yet it pours easily. I primarily use it in my coffee. I think it actually improves the taste of my coffee. I would have given it five stars, but my last order leaked out around the caps during shipment!  The safety seals on the top of the bottles were all loose, and the syrup was all over the bottles and inside the box. I had to wash them all off! This was the only shipment that I had this problem with, so I don't know what's going on with the packaging process, but I hope they fix it. The bottle caps weren't tight enough, and every time I used the syrup, somehow it would leak out around the cap. It would leak out and drip down the bottle and run underneath it, which made the bottle stick to my counter top. No matter how well I washed the bottle and dried it after using it, throughout the day it would slowly seep out and end up a sticky mess on one side and underneath.<br />There is one other issue that I'm not happy about. The labeling is misleading. It says that it contains 23.5 ounces.  Typically, liquid products are labeled in ounces by volume, but this product is labeled in ounces by net weight. There is only about 17 liquid ounces in the bottle, which means that there is only a little over 2 cups of syrup per bottle. I was expecting almost 3 cups per bottle. I think Amazon should update their wording to explain this fact, as there is a huge difference between 2 and 3 cups of syrup!<br />I have this product on auto-ship. I will order it one more time, but if there are leaking problems with that shipment, I won't order it again until the problem is fixed.

review/summary: Finally, sweet perfection
review/text: I thought I had my answer with maple syrup, but this agave nectar is the perfect beverage sweetener. It does what a sweetener is intended to do -- adds sweetness without adding any additional flavors to distort the taste of whatever it is being added to. And I don't feel spacey after consuming it the way other sweeteners sometimes make me feel. There is no after-taste (unlike stevia, which I can't understand all the hub-bub about), and it has a nice consistency that causes it to dissolve very quickly, just like maple syrup - only at about 1/3 the cost of maple syrup where I live!<br /><br />I'm so glad I decided to give this a try just to check out something new. No more brown rice syrup (clumpy and with a distorting flavor), no more honey (solidifies in the frig and also strong taste), no more maple syrup (too expensive), and certainly no more sugar, artificial sweeteners, or nasty stevia. Hello blue agave! This is absolutely the perfect sweetener.

I contacted the company to confirm it was processed at the low temperatures as they say on the label and they did confirm that and some of  my other questions.  I can put this on top of food like a syrup and I don't get the sugar spikes like I do with the subsequent crashes afterwards.  I do use an American made product (does not use corn or other substances from China) Xylitol from Global Sweet which works well but doesn't offer the versatility of the liquid so I do use both but this works well in baking to right out of the bottle.  I love this product.

review/text: You can't get much better than this!  Yummy poured over sweet potatoes.  Great substitute for syrup.  Can be added to hot tea.  Tastes like a mixture of mild honey and maple syrup.

review/summary: The best sweetener!
review/text: I bought the Blue Agave Nectar as part of a no white sugar, no white flour diet that I'm on and I love the taste and my children love the taste.  I have used it several times in baking as well as for pancake syrup for the kids, and I sweeten my hot cereal with it.  I don't know how I ever made it without this. I can tell it doesn't affect my blood sugar because of how I feel after using it.

review/summary: Excellent sweetener
review/text: I have been using Wholesome Sweetener for about 6 months, buying from a local grocery.  I love that its very sweet, but easier on my system than sugar or honey.  I use this sweetener in place of sugar in all things, and I really like it.<br />The packaging from Amazon was great, no drips or sticky bottles in either box.  Great to get a bigger size bottle than I can get in town for a very reasonable price.

review/summary: 100% high-fructose sweetner anyone?
review/text: Up until yesterday, my family and I enjoyed this product versus raw sugar or any other sweetener. We even got past the extra liquidity of our oatmeal once we added blue agave. Alas, having been informed of yet other feat of ingenious marketing, I am tossing out two unopened and one partially finished bottles.<br /><br />Before consuming another drop, take a look at this recently published article:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />"Agave syrup (nectar) is basically high-fructose corn syrup masquerading as a health food. Sorry. Don't kill the messenger..."<br /><br />and goes on to say:<br /><br />"Agave nectar has a low-glycemic index for one reason only: it's largely made of fructose, which although it has a low-glycemic index, is probably the single most damaging form of sugar when used as a sweetener. With the exception of pure liquid fructose, agave nectar has the highest fructose content of any commercial sweetener.<br /><br />All sugar -- from table sugar to HFCS (high-fructose corn syrup) to honey -- contains some mixture of fructose and glucose. Table sugar is 50/50, HFCS is 55/45. Agave nectar is a whopping 90 percent fructose, almost -- but not quite -- twice as high as HFCS.<br /><br />In the agave plant, most of the sweetness comes from a particular kind of fructose called inulin, which actually has some health benefits -- it's considered a fiber. But there's not much inulin left in the actual syrup. In the manufacturing process, enzymes are added to the inulin to break it down into digestible sugar (fructose), resulting in a syrup that has a fructose content that is, at best, 57 percent and -- much more commonly -- as high as 90 percent.<br /><br />Agave nectar syrup is a triumph of marketing over science. True, it has a low-glycemic index, but so does gasoline -- that doesn't mean it's good for you.<br /><br />If you simply must have some sweets, a small amount of agave nectar every once in a while isn't going to kill you. Just don't buy into the idea that it's any better for you than plain old sugar or HFCS."<br /><br />If anyone is interested in purchasing my unopened bottles, let me know before the end of the week!

review/summary: Butter
review/text: Follow up Review<br /><br />The 6 bottles that I got were quite decent but did not have the exquisite buttery taste that the initial large bottle that I got has.  Not sure what the quality issue is here.  I would still be comfortable with recommending buying but keep you expectations a little sheltered.<br /><br />Initial Review<br /><br />I just started eating this - I have been using the Madhava instead of honey - honey is expensive and seems to be tough on my body - I don't have the same negative reactions using agave.<br /><br />I understand what the recent negative review said about Agave - I suspect some/much is true.  HOWEVER, this agave taste so smooth and buttery - WHAT THE HELL - LIVE HARD AND DIE YOUNG!  I don't even bother putting this on cereal because it is a waste - I just drink it from the bottle to fully enjoy all the taste.<br /><br />Here is the reality - I don't get the same negative effect as I do other sweetners - so whatever it is - there is something different - at least for my body.<br /><br />Other products from Wholesome Sweetners inc. the molassas and honey are FANTASTIC.<br /><br />I have only had one 44 oz bottle - NO quality problem with the product that I have.

review/text: This is a great sweetener, without a bitter after taste.  Low glycemic index means I don't get a sugar high and crash, just a little sweetening when and where I want it.

review/summary: Super Sweet with many uses
review/text: I have read the other reviews regarding Agave vs. corn syrup and my mom and I are both diabetics and CAN use this stuff, but CANNOT use high fructose corn syrup.  So while the reviews regarding their relationship may hold a bit of truth to them, so do the claims of this being an easier sugar for us diabetics to process on the glycemic scale.  The numbers on my glucometer are proof enough for me without getting into a complete nutritional agrument.  With that said, I don't go hog wild and pour this all over everything.  I do use this as a substitute for things like when I make homemade granola, and espcially when I make my homemade yogurt (it's awesome when using to sweeten my vanilla yogurt).  I also use it in my tea which is super yummy.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful alternative to sweetening certain things - especially for those of us who are diabetics.

review/summary: Good syrup substitute
review/text: Our family loves this product and this is the least expensive way I have found to purchase it (particularly through the auto-ship).  We use it in oatmeal instead of sugar (not as strong of a flavor, but enough to sweeten it) and on pancakes and waffles instead of syrup (a perfect substitute).  It's good to know my kids aren't going to have a morning sugar high and then crash in the middle of the school day.  A little goes a long way, so the bottles last a good amount of time.  I have baked a few times with it with good results (particularly homemade marshmallows & frostings), but find other sweetner substitutes more economical.

review/summary: Great Product Lousey Shipping
review/text: This product is excellent as usual, it it unfortunate that the quality of the order was marred by careless shipping that loosley packed the product into a much larger box with little or nothing to restrain the product from moving and leaking<br />...and leak it did...all over all the other bottles. My assumption is temperature extremes, plus just plain careless substandard packing<br />a rare failure for this retailer. but they never offered an apology to a letter of complaint.<br />Product Score 4+ Amazon Score-4

review/summary: Raw Blue Agave
review/text: This is a great product, I use it in my coffee in place of sugar. Doesnt raise Blood sugar levels and tastes great. It doesnt harden like honey and is sweeter than artificial aweeteners that are not good for you. I always order 2 cases at a time (using free shipping)to have it on hand and they always come well packaged and secure. When I have tried to order less than a case they arent tightly packaged and have come open, it was a mess. Good product if you need a sugar alternative, mixes in hot or cold.

review/summary: Excellent taste, texture, cookability
review/text: This is excellent tasting Agave Nectar.  It has just a hint of molasses taste, but not enough to alter the taste of what you use it in.  My husband has been using it in his coffee and has completely cut out sugar.  We use it in oatmeal and in baked goods also, and like it better than the lighter colored version.
