review/text: First time trying Himalayan Pink Salt and I love it! The product itself deserves a five star but knocked a star off for the shipping price. Seems a little high for a small item like this. If you have a Trader Joe's near you its much cheaper to just get it there but if you don't like me then you have no choice but to get it here and pay five bucks for the shipping. I've never been much of a regular salt user but was having electrolyte issues so started using this in place of table salt and liking it so much I'll never go back to regular table salt.

review/summary: completely bland, flavorles, tasteless "jumbo" lump crab
review/text: For the first time, I'm going to look into returning a purchase to Amazon, sorry.  I expected jumbo lump crab, but got some totally wet, soggy, tasteless lumps of white pieces of crab.  I've had jumbo lump crab in the past, this is not it.  For some reason, it's packed in some sort of liquid and then the can is lined with some sort of paper substance.  I've used this companies products for many years, this is not up to their usual standards.  The pieces are quit small, like they came from a small crabs and they are saturated with liquid.  Lump crab that I have bought previously in the pouch has almost no  liquid run off and consequently the crab is tasty and solid.  Krab tastes better to me.  I thought it was a good deal as the price per pound computed to be about half what I usually pay, but a bad bargain to say the least.

review/text: I got some of this blend thinking that it would be a little different on steamed vegetables or greens, but when I tried it on eggs, I was astounded!  Used sparingly, it really makes plain old scrambled eggs into a taste treat.<p>The key  with all of these spice blends is to USE SPARINGLY!  I've used most of the other blends as well - a little goes a long way towards creating subtle overtones in your dishes.  Another good one is &quot;Are You Game?&quot;  Mostly I use that for meat dishes, but it's really good in lasagne and spaghetti sauce too.

review/summary: Nice flavor, No Gluten, cooks FASTER than some other McDougall instant soups, thinner than other split pea one
review/text: I had previously ordered and enjoyed the Split Pea with Barley  by Dr. McD. I ordered this one this time because I saw it was lighter in sodium.<br /><br />It cooked up fine in two minutes of steeping in the hot water. It had a nice texture and flavor, but it was thinner than the Split Pea with Barley, which is why I liked the other one better.<br /><br />This cup of soup has 200 calories , 1 gram of fat, 13 grams of protein, 9 grams of fiber, and 360 mg of sodium. It boasts 30% of recommended daily value of Vit A and 12% of iron. The entire cup is considered one serving (which I specify as some McD cup products specify two servings per container.) For those who have issues with gluten, this has NO GLUTEN.<br /><br />For those who want a more healthful option in convenience foods/instant soups, this is a nice choice. Solid pea flavor, easy to fix, no animal products. A nice little soup. (But I do give a higher thumbs up to the one with barley).

review/summary: Very Good Taste, Great For You, Excellent Price On Amazon
review/text: I love soup cups because they are quick, easy and don't create a lot of mess to clean up. Most soup cups, especially in grocery stores are way too high in sodium to be even remotely healthy. These Dr McDougall's soups address all of these issues. They are Vegan, and even if you are not, you will find them tasty and good for you. Plus, if you have allergies, the odds are with vegan foods, that what you are allergic to isn't in here.<br /><br />Not all of the nutrition information is shown, so here goes: 200 calories, NO FAT, NO CHOLESTEROL, Sodium 360mg [a lot lower than I've seen in any other brand of soup cup], Carbs 35 grams, Fiber 9 grams, PROTEIN 13 GRAMS. It's a good source of Vitamin A and Iron. If you are a veggie person, you know that you have to pay attention to make sure you get enough protein. This is a great source, especially for a 200 calorie serving. The cup, by the way, is larger than most. It's a very satisfying serving.<br /><br />Other than the dehydrated peas, the other ingredients are in a foil pouch inside the cup. I can only assume it keeps the ingredients fresher. Let it sit for three or four minutes and it gets nicely thick.<br /><br />If you are not participating in Amazon Subscribe and Save, consider it. If you set up a regular delivery schedule, anywhere from one to six months, you get a 15% discount plus free shipping without the $25 requirement. This soup is hard to find in stores and when you do, it's more expensive than it is on Amazon. Plus, you can order early or cancel an order if you need to.<br /><br />I'm not trying to pimp for Amazon, it's just that I've found it to be the best deal.

It does take a while for the soup to "cook" in the hot water, but I think the end result is better than instant.  You can sip it from the cup in the car if need be! I like the California Highway split pea soup and this is smooth like that, but a more complex or adult taste.  Probably thyme. Overall, it is fabulous for the health/price/taste/convenience ratio.

review/text: I'm still disappointed with the "lower sodium" label.  Of course you will get less sodium if you decrease the amount in the cup by 50%!  The large Mc Dougall soup cups contain two servings typically - have you tried to share one or keep it for another day?<br /><br />My solution is to use about 3/4 of the "seasoning packet" (assuming that the sodium is there and not in the dried flakes).  The flavor and texture are still good.  I wish their advertising was more transparent - it would make me trust the company a little more.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I really enjoy this soup. It's just the right consistency, not too salty or spicy, just real comfort food. It also dissolves better than the grocery store brands when you add the hot water. Just stir a few times after you add the water, while letting it "sit". I appreciate the fact that there is no msg or artificial additives.

review/text: I think this is the second best tasting McDougall's product, the first being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFIEL2">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 6)</a> I've found that all Dr. McDougall's soups benefit from preparing them according the instructions on one of the other soup's I didn't like so well. After the initial heat-up, stir thoroughly and Microwave for an addt'l 5 mins @ 20% power, yes that is twenty percent power. This helps to thicken it up, soften any noodles and meld the flavours a lot more.<br /><br />I prefer my Split Pea kind of chunky so I found adding 2 heaping T of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JW622Y">Quaker Oats Old Fashioned Oatmeal, 18-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 6)</a> helps a lot without adding too many calories plus more fiber to the 9 grams already in this soup.<br /><br />Hope that helps ya'all

review/summary: Light, Crisp, Refreshing.  Tasty!
review/text: I received my case of Izze Grapefruit Sparkling Juice on a Tuesday, and it was gone by Friday.  My wife and I sampled one can together, and immediately put the whole case in the fridge, pushing aside other juice beverages to make room.  For the next two and a half days, my wife and I eye-balled each other every time we went to the fridge, keeping tabs on how many cans were left.  And on Saturday, the day after the last can was gone, we felt like Izze addicts, jonesing for another can.  Just one more...<br /><br />If you are a Fresca fan, you will more than likely love this beverage.  It has a snappy, zingy body, light and refreshing, perfect with ice.  This would make an outstanding summer drink in a tall glass with ice, out on the deck, reading a book in the sun.  I dare say it wouldn't be a bad mixer, either, if you wanted to spike it  ;^)<br /><br />The nutritional content of the drink is what you make of it.  With 70% juice and 30% sparkling water, it's 8.4 ounces are going to have some calories (90 in a can).  It's also going to have vitamin c and niacin.  I've noticed some reviewers say that you'd be better off taking a multivitamin, but if you're drinking it strictly to get vitamins, I think I'd have to look at you with my head tilted slightly to one side and make a Scooby-Doo noise at you.  :^)  No one should get all of their daily recommended vitamins from a drink like this; what Izze is going to do for you is be a tasty, refreshing drink that's a much, much better option for a health-conscious person than a diet soda or most other drinks that you enjoy as a treat.<br /><br />If you're ever in a convenience store and notice an Izze drink in the cooler door, pick one up and try it.  Don't buy a case because it might not be your thing... but do try it.  I loved the Grapefruit version, and I will certainly try the other flavors as well.

review/text: I was a little skeptical at first when I got these for my kids, but I came away impressed.  They loved the taste of the grapefruit, apple, & pomegranate flavors, and I felt good that with fruit juice and added vitamins Izze is healthier than regular soda.  Downsides: they are still concentrated simple carbs, there are some health concerns regarding the health effects of carbonated beverages, and the premium price.

review/text: IZZE Grapefruit is great for those who think regular grapefruit juice is too acidic or overpowering. This blend is just perfect -- a bit of sparkling water with the grapefruit juice and not much else. This allows for a refreshing taste, but make sure it is cold. Given that I'm not much of a carbonated soda drinker, this isn't a replacement for a can of Sprite. Rather, it's just another beverage in my arsenal to replace my other daily juices if I don't want to go crazy on the calories.

review/summary: Terrific sparkling juice....
review/text: I love this juice (grapefruit).  Not too sweet, not too tart, just the right amount of flavor and fizz.<br /><br />I will say that it tastes better if I pour it into a glass - it eliminates the sort of metallic pretaste that I get when I breath right before I take a sip, which, apparently I do quite a bit.<br /><br />But honestly, half the time I am too lazy to get a glass and this beverage still tastes great.  I also love the 8 oz size, that is pretty much the amount I like to drink at any given time.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this again!  And what a luscious range of flavors, I can't wait to try some of the others.

review/summary: Seems like a healthy choice. . . but, it's really not.
review/text: This review is for the grapefruit flavor, but I've tried clementine and pomegranate, too.<br /><br />I'm continually surprised at what passes for "healthy".  I received this product to review but was already familiar with Izze sodas, as they're available at most Starbucks and now at grocery stores, as well.<br /><br />These are 8.4 oz cans and each can is 90 calories.  Since nutritional data isn't included in the item description, I'll include them here.<br />Each 8.4 oz serving has 10 mg sodium, 20 gm carbohydrates, and 20 grams of sugar.<br /><br />So, for those who believe this is a "healthy" alternative to sodas, I would disagree.  An 8-oz serving of Caffeine-free Coca Cola Classic has 97 calories, 27 grams of carbohydrates, 33 gm sodium, 24 grams of sugar.<br /><br />So, really, having an Izze isn't such a healthy alternative to having a coke.  You aren't reducing your sugar intake with an Izze nor will you reduce your carb intake.  Yes, it's juice and "natural" but your body responds to sugar and carbs quite the same whether the sugar comes from juice or another source.<br /><br />The sugars that come from juice is fructose-- and your body responds to fructose the same way it responds to table sugar.  They both cause your insulin levels to increase.  Each 8 oz glass of juice has about 8 full teaspoons of sugar.  So, if this 8.4 oz can of Izze soda is made up of 70% juice, you are still consuming 5.8 teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Whole fruit is much healthier than juice since the fiber has not been stripped away.  Fiber moderates the release of the sugar in your bloodstream and moderates the insulin release.<br /><br />Sorry for the nutrition lesson.<br /><br />Izze sodas TASTE good-- and even this Grapefruit (and I don't care for grapefruit) tastes good.  As long as one understands they aren't having something "healthy" when they have this sparkling juice, great-- if it's just taste you are looking for, give this a try.  Sometimes, though, a pretty label and a spot on a shelf in the Organic Food store causes people to believe that what they are consuming is healthy when, in fact, it's just not.<br /><br />I received a case of 24 cans.  My family enjoys Izze sparkling juices because they taste good and, because we have them, I don't mind them drinking them.  Even though I will occasionally purchase Izze juices for my children when we're out and hit Starbucks, I never buy sugary drinks at the store.  I consider these sparkling juices to be empty calories. When this supply is through, we won't buy them again to keep at home.<br /><br />4 stars for taste.

review/summary: Good stuff ... fruit drink that may taste like chalk! ...
review/text: Yeah, chalk ... or a semi-neuvo, lightly carbonated fruit drink.<br /><br />I purchased some of this recently at Target, in Pomegranate, Raspberry and Grapefruit. I was happily satisfied, pleased and invigorated like one of those exploding or overactive guys on one of those Mountain Dew commercials.<br /><br />While the taste isn't too overpowering it's also not something that makes you go: "Hmmmm? What am I drinking?", much like some of those other energy drinks like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTST70">Red Bull</a>, or other juice based energy drinks that seem to be made of something indescribable that's close to: "wow, chemically ...".<br /><br />Good stuff though, gotta love it. Might be popular with the rave crowds once they start mixing it with Vodka, Tequila or God knows what else. I don't think the acquisition of this company by Pepsi will effect the product like some of the earlier internet reports had believed. They do know to leave well enough alone when they want to.<br /><br />I must say that after reading that Niacin was an ingredient, my concern regarding the 10% of your daily allowance in 8.4 fluid ounces, could equate to it being quite a bit or too much. This may cause contraindications with folks who have had a stroke (myocardial infarction) or Liver disease as even mediocre doses of Niacin have been problematic.

Now Izze lives in our refrigerator beside our trusty Diet Coke and bottles of water.<br /><br />Why do we like it so much? It's not too sweet, not too carbonated, with a rich fruit flavor.

review/summary: Grapefruit juice with a kick...
review/text: I love grapefruit juice and consider myself a purist when it comes to juices, so I was a bit apprehensive about taking a great taste and adding a sparkling water fizz.  I had some expectations that this wasn't going to be a hit with me.  Izze Fortified All Natural Sparkling Juice was a pleasant surprise and a kick in the pants.  I love it.  I still get the pure taste of grapefruit juice and the sparkling water doesn't overpower the taste.  In fact, it enhances the experience.  I thought by ordering grapefruit (which I'm the only one in the family that likes it), I'd be safe, but the kids have discovered it and I find empties every morning where they can't help but have a can.  It doesn't have a can taste like some juices in a can either.  Overall, I'll buy this product whenever I see it.  It tastes great, has a special kick which doesn't take away from the pure fruit flavor and is an all round great compromise between a fruit juice and a fortified energy drink.  Bravo!

review/summary: Grapefruit is just plain delicious!
review/text: Izze's 8.4 ounce, canned 'Sparkling Grapefruit,' juice is nothing short of delicious and immensely refreshing to boot.  I've tried several other varieties in their sparkling juice line and without hesitation can say that Grapefruit is the definite standout out of the bunch.  This particular flavor has all of the vibrant citrus intensity you'd expect from a fresh grapefruit with just a hint of added sweetness (no refined sugars are added FYI) to perfectly balance the natural tartness.  Couple that with the effervescence of the sparkling water base and you have a well balanced canned beverage that quenches and dazzles the palette immediately.<br /><br />As an added tip - The Sparkling Grapefruit drink makes for an awesome component to cocktails.  Mix the juice from 1 can with 3 shots of high quality vodka, then pour over some crushed ice and serve in your favorite cocktail glasses.  Guaranteed party hit right there!

review/summary: The best grapefruit drink EVER!
review/text: I love grapefruit juice, but so often it is of poor quality and bitter to taste. Or, to the other extreme, it is so loaded with sugars to mask the bitterness it becomes like drinking syrup. A few years ago, you could buy grapefruit drink from Swan's that was excellent, but then they quite making it. Go figure.<br /><br />I thought I'd never find a grapefruit drink I liked as well as the Swan's, but this is it! In fact, being lightly carbonated, this is even better! I love this stuff, and at only 20 carbs, it doesn't have an adverse effect on my diabetes as long as I limit myself.<br /><br />I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Light, Refreshing & Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: I was a bit skeptical about this product before trying it, as I am not a soda drinker by any stretch of the imagination. However, I decided to give it a go. Not only was I not disappointed, I absolutely LOVED it!<br /><br />The Izze Fortified All-Natural Juice (I tried the Grapefruit version) is light and refreshing and JUST sweet enough (not cloying the way sodas can be). Its crisp taste and gentle bubbles remind me a great deal of Orangina, which I always liked. The cans are smaller than regular soda, which I also view as a good thing, as I can never finish a whole can on those occasions when I do drink it. The fact that this drink is also fortified with vitamins is an added bonus (though I've gotta say that the fortification is a bit weak; nothing terribly exciting there).<br /><br />I look forward to trying the other flavors, but I am totally sold on IZZE and can, with a clear conscience, recommend it most highly!

review/text: This is a very tasty, not too sugary mix of juices (including white grape and apple), with greapefruit juice (no pulp) and carbonated water addes in.  I found it to be a very refreshing alterantive to Coke or Pepsi.  It has pretty much the same amount of sugar, but at least it comes in a can about 2/3s the standard size Coke or Pepsi can.  I find that it takes a while to drink one of these cans, so you do get fewer calories than standard soft drinks.  There is no refined sugar, caffeine, or preservatives, so is a better alternative to soda. I find that this is a great drink to have after some time outside on a warm day and really look forward to trying some of the other flavors.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/text: As a recovering soda junkie, I crave carbonation and sweetness.  Izze offers this in fruit form.  One of my favorite sodas was Squirt, and I have found that Izze grapefruit sparkling juice is a great replacement.  I have drank Izze out of bottles and cans, and while I prefer it in the bottle, the cans offer a smaller portion and are easier to pack (and ship, obviously).  Subscribe and save is the way to go on these, as they can be quite expensive in the store, and home delivery with a great price is hard to beat.

This Grapefruit flavor is my favorite of the 5 IZZE can varieties. I love grapefruits in general so this is a great match for me. It's not overly sweet and has a nice tart taste. It's very refreshing. If you like grapefruits you will love this.

review/summary: This soda tastes good, but it's not SCD-legal
review/text: I bought Izze Soda's based on a recommendation from a person on the Specific Carbohydrate Diet. The soda is tasty, good and sweet. It actually tastes like grapefruit too, with a strong dry fruity flavor.<br /><br />It's great over ice, but it is NOT SCD LEGAL, at least not the grapefruit flavor, because of the gum acacia. Heartbreaking. The gum is a polysaccharide, a complex sugar which cannot be digested by SCD'ers. I know better now.

review/summary: good alternative to soda (but pricey!)
review/text: The IZZE Grapefruit sparkling juice is my favorite amongst the blackberry and the green apple.<br /><br />It is NOT a healthy drink but a HEALTHIER drink than the sodas.<br /><br />It is NOT for those seeking a low calorie alternative to their diets.<br /><br />The sugar in this product is of the faster converting carb so it won't help you much in your waist-line.<br /><br />With that said, it IS a healthier drink if one prefers to have some sparkling drinks with their meals, which I do.<br /><br />I drink water throughout the day but when I eat, I like to pair my food with drinks. I am not a big wine drinker nor am I a big soda drinker. On those days that I am not in the mood for wine, this drink enhances my eating experience.<br /><br />unless they are inconsistant with each batch (it IS hard to gauge fruit juice, but because it IS mixed with other juices, I suspect they taste it before they can it), the grapefruit soda is just the right balance. Not too sweet and leaves a nice after taste in your mouth.<br /><br />Pairs good with chicken and seafood dishes. ( I like the blackberry for steak and stews and have used the blackberry for substitute when some recipes calls for coke)<br /><br />It IS expensive though for the amount and size. I would not give this to children thinking it is good for them.<br /><br />Moderation with everything is the key. We shouldn't neglect and abstain from things that we love, just eat and drink with moderation and we can eat just about anything without giving it up completely (OK, this last sentence is a bit self-serving...now I'll serve me up one of them grapefruit sparklies!!)

review/text: I was looking for this drink in a bunch of stores. I finally found them but for a 4 pack they wanted about $5.00 I thought that was a bit much then i check on amazon and I was shocked that they had them. This is the first time I used the subscription system. I got a discount for using it also. I never have to think about running out since I get a 24 pack mailed to my house every month. Its a great drink and even better for the health conscious. If you want to try something other than soda give Izze's a try.

review/text: I must confess to being completely taken by this juice.  I adore the packaging, the name, and even the story behind its birth.<br /><br />The taste is delightfully refreshing and different.  And while it does nothing in aiding the diet or lowering your sugar intake, it does make you feel better about drinking it since it is not a soft drink per say.<br /><br />My husband who hates all things that could potentially be healthy would allow me to put this into his lunch.  It was a huge deal that he liked these.  Again, it's better than the Mountain Dew he constantly drinks otherwise.<br /><br />Fun, fruity, and unique... we do buy this juice occasionally.  However, it too is hard to find and expensive when we do to carry it as a regular grocery staple.

review/text: I was recently given the opportunity to try Izze Sparkling Grapefruit Juice, and I am very glad I did!  With none of the added sugars contained in similar products, Izze relies on its own taste to draw the consumer in, and the addition of the sparkling water enhances the flavor rather nicely.  If you are a consumer who enjoys all natural flavor with a little pizzazz to it, then Izze is definitely the product for you!

review/summary: Refreshing, not-too-sweet
review/text: I quit drinking sodas years ago, given that they're basically filled with heaps of sugar and empty calories.  And -- let's be honest -- drinking Izze's or even pure fruit juice isn't exactly great for you:  it's sugar and some vitamins / nutrients but without the fiber and such.<br /><br />So with the up-front admission that Izze's is hardly health food, let me express why I think this is still a worthwhile treat to have around the house:<br /><br />- Not as sweet as pure fruit juice, and that IMHO is a good thing.<br />- Fewer calories and far less junk than sodas.<br />- Will satisfy a soda craving even, I think, in the most soda'est of junkies.<br />- Perfect balance of sweet vs. tart.<br />- Just the right amount of carbonation.<br />- And (kiddies, shield your eyes) it's tasty when mixed with alcohol (say, rum or vodka :-).

I mean, very few people want to chug down a gallon of Grapefruit juice, but this small size is perfect. And its easy to throw one in your gym bag, grab one on the way out the door, or just reach in and grab a quick drink.<br /><br />The juice itself is refreshing and clean, giving you a good dose of vitamins and all that good stuff. The taste is exceptionally good.<br /><br />I also used this to make a smoothie and it provided a good juice base.

review/text: I have given up regular soda almost all together for a few years. I just don't think that it's worth all the calories and sugar to drink an 8OZ soda with quarter of which being pure corn syrup. The IZZE beverage, however, is a welcoming sea change in the carbonated beverages market. It has pure fruit juice, with no extra sugar added, and fortified with vitamins your body needs anyway. Each can has around 90 calories, which is easily manageable with most diet plans. Taste wise, IZZE also met all my expectations: delicious, refreshing, with no strange flavors and aftertastes. Recommended.

review/summary: Not bad -- not bad at all
review/text: The only Izze drink I've had the chance to try is the "sparkling grapefruit," and I have to say that - while I'm not much of a grapefruit fan - this stuff is pretty dark drinkable.  It has a slightly punchy aftertaste, but I'm guessing that's pretty much a universal grapefruit thing.  Each Izze can holds only 8.4 fluid ounces, which sounds a mite puny for those of us used to chugging down several 20 oz bottles of Dr. Pepper and Sun Drop a day, but it's actually a pretty good size.  This isn't the kind of drink I could pour down my throat in large quantities, not without getting sick of it pretty fast, anyway.  I can only take so much fruity goodness a day.<br /><br />While this is a "naturally flavored juice beverage" fortified with vitamins, containing no caffeine and very low sodium, don't expect a can a day to take care of your suggested daily intake of vitamins or anything else - all you're looking at is 10% of your daily recommended amount of Vitamin C, Vitamin B6, and Niacin.  Along with that, you're ingesting 20 grams of sugar (albeit not refined sugar) per can, and the whole concoction weighs in at 90 calories.<br /><br />If you have to deal with acid reflux, you might be reluctant to try this drink.  Acidic fruit can be quite unkind to those of us with this condition, as can the bubbly goodness of carbonated water (or, if you want to be all fancy-schmancy about it, "sparkling water").  All I can tell you is that I haven't had any problems - but I've never had more than one of these Izze drinks in a single day and I do take medicine daily to combat my own acid reflux.  If heartburn pays you a visit more than once a week and you aren't fighting back with Prilosec or some similar medication, I suspect that you and Izze may not get along too well together.<br /><br />Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the cost of these things.  Even if you think the ancient gods' ambrosia couldn't hold a candle to Izze, you have to consider the fact that these things cost the better part of a buck apiece - and remember, we're only talking about 8.4 fluid ounces per can.  That's a might steep where I come from.  If at all possible, I would recommend you try one of these drinks out for yourself before ordering two dozen of them.

review/summary: great as far as juice beverages go...
review/text: I will be honest - not a huge fan of sparkling juice beverages. However I was surprised by how refreshing this drink was. I would bet that if it were made out of a sweeter fruit, it would be impossible but grapefruit Izze is lovely. It was basically like drinking a grapefruit fresh from the fridge in the morning. It is fortified with a bit of niacin, B1 and B6. No sugar added. 90 cals in a can. Doesn't hold the spark over a pretty short period of time. Overall, I would buy it again, as it's not as high in calories as juice itself, and is definitely more healthy than many other choices in carbonated sodas.

review/text: All natural and delicious, what more could you ask for?  Well, a little more per serving might be nice.  I can easily go through 2-3 cans of this healthy nectar in one go.  Perhaps if the portion size were slightly larger I would be less tempted to crack open another can.<br /><br />That niggle aside though, I really love this stuff.<br />It is refreshing and tart and not too sweet.  No high-fructose corn syrup here.<br />You get a does of vitamins (B, C & Niacin) as well, show me a regular soda that has that!<br />My family and co-workers tried it and really like Izze as well.<br />It is a great size to pop in a bag to bring with you.<br />The scent is almost like aromatherapy.<br />The manufacturer is a small company I can get behind.<br /><br />At the end of the day, for ultimate healthiness, you are probably better off eating some real fruit and drinking water.  But if you have a soda craving, this will get you over the hump.  I can't wait to try the other flavors as well!

review/summary: Gotta Love It!
review/text: Now this is good!  How often do you come across a beverage that really seems different from all the rest?  IZZE Sparkling Juice meets that criteria for me, an all-natural blend of pure fruit juice and sparkling water.  Did I say natural?  There is none of the added caffeine, fructose and artificial ingredients that you'll find in cola-this or dew-that. Using only the fruit juice only for sweetening, it won't leave your taste buds feeling syrupy or hungry for another sugar fix.  That all conspires a little with the calories, since it packs 90 of them into a little 8.4 oz can.<br /><br />My favorite is the Sparkling Grapefruit.  It's light and I love the flavor of grapefruit anyway.<br /><br />As I mentioned, the size of the can is small, which makes it great for taking it on the go.  And while I haven't tried it as a mixture with vodka, I somehow think that just might make a most refreshing imbibe while sitting out on the deck enjoying a warm summer's evening.

review/text: I really enjoyed the grapefruit flavored IZZE.  At first it was a little strong, but the flavor efinitely grew on me.  I am not one who likes grapefruit, but I normally enjoy grapefruit flavored sodas like Squirt.  Unlike Squirt, IZZE tastes like real grapefruit juice, just carbonated.  It is not overly sweet and is quite refreshing.  It reminds me of the sports drink "Super Socco" from the mid-80's.<br /><br />I would definitely endorse this flavor for anyone who enjoys a tart drink.

review/summary: Just another form of liquid sugar, but I like controlled portion size...
review/text: Izze's grapefruit flavored sparkling juice is, for all practical purposes, just another formulation of liquid sugar, albeit from grape, pear, and other fruits.  Nutritionally, it really is no different from any other sugar-based drink, whether orange juice or sugar soda.  What makes it acceptable is both its taste (more below) and its controlled portion size (8.4-ounces).  That 8.4 ounces is a far cry from the normal 12, the increasingly common 20, and those other large portions that "fool" the consumer with the nutritional note that there are "only" 110 calories per serving but there are 2.5 or more portions!<br /><br />I conducted a taste test of this grapefruit flavored Izze with two teenagers, two registered nurses, one registered dietitian, and two adult athletes.  They all were impressed with the flavor, and thought the "gentle" carbonation added to the enjoyment.  One teen mentioned that the smaller size encouraged sipping rather than chugging.  It is much better cold than at room temperature.<br /><br />The aluminum container is recyclable (encouraged).  I've seen this particular brand and size sold at cafes for about a buck fifty a can.<br /><br />Enjoyable!  I hope this comes out in a calorie-free version as well.

review/text: The grapefruit flavor is a huge hit at my house.  Everyone loves the taste -- not too sweet, not too bitter, and very grapefruity despite the dominance of other juice concentrates in the ingredient list.  My only real quibble with it is that the cans are too tall to fit in the soft drink can tray in my refrigerator, the kind that many new refrigerators have hanging from one of the shelves as a convenient space-saving measure.  These cans are made more for stacking flat on shelves, not for rolling out of soft-drink trays.  Oh yeah -- and then there are the 20 grams of sugar per serving, but it still beats sugary soft drinks sweetened with high-fructose corn syrup by a mile and tastes a heck of a lot better.

It's a fruit juice blend, from concentrate, so it's not substitute for real, freshly squeezed juice -- but it's certainly a wise alternative to sodas. I've held the line at four stars because I prefer glass to aluminum when it comes to beverage packaging.

review/text: It's like Fresca, only with calories and tinier bubbles. Actually Izze Sparkling Grapefruit it tastes better than Fresca, at least 90 calories better, and that's a fair trade in my book. Izze Sparkling Grapefruit (it's mostly not grapefruit, fourth among the five fruit juice concentrates in the list of ingredients, after white grape, apple and orange) has a friendly, refreshing taste. A great pick-me-up for the 1:00 office drone doldrums. I drank it straight from the slim, 5 1/4 inch tall can--like one of those tiny airline juice cans on steroids--so can't comment on it's hue. Label readers, you won't find any red dye number two here: Izze uses red radish juice (for color). I think I'll serve my next can of Izze Sparkling Grapefuit on the rocks--yes, there'll be another can--and maybe bam it up with a shot or two of Absolut.

I drink Poland Spring Seltzer lemon flavor etc... from cans so that isn't the issue.  I've had this same soda in bottles and love the taste - especially the grapefruit!  This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.  Maybe it is like many of these organic companies who were bought out by the big giants - unable to make it on their own...<br />But, the metal taste was so bad we were unable to drink ANY of them!

review/text: Izzie Fortified Graprefuit Juice is a refreshing, fruity delight. I truly enjoyed the nutrition of the real juice component and the sparkling water addition. I especially enjoyed it chilled from the refrigerator, however, I poured it into a cup, placing it into the freezer and it made for a nice, frozen treat, that adults and children could adult. Izze Sparkling Grapefruit would also be a nice addition to summer, adult beverages.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product to juice and sparkling water lovers.<br /><br />Angelia Menchan

review/summary: The next best thing to homemade.
review/text: When I'm at home and properly prepared, I mix organic juice concentrates with Gerholsteiner naturally carbonated mineral water. The next best choice is  Izze, (not just this flavor, they're all excellent). While they sometimes use 'filler' juice like grape, Izze also comes up with mixes that enhance the primary flavor.

review/summary: 4 star product, 2 star packaging
review/text: The product itself has been reviewed sufficiently already - it's tasty enough and a bit healthier than soda. It also lacks those nasty preservatives.<br /><br />The problem with buying this product from Amazon is the way Amazon delivers it. My 24 pack was delivered in a regular cardboard box. The Izze packaging is just a flimsy cardboard tray with plastic wrap covering the cans. The wrap doesn't cover the cans very well and isn't particularly snug. Since Amazon does pack this into a regular cardboard box for you, you won't need to worry about losing any of the cans in transit - but they will be clanking around in the box when it arrives on your doorstep. Open them slowly. If the Amazon box was smaller, this wouldn't happen.

review/text: The side of the can sums up: "Izze fortified is naturally sweet with no refined sugars, no caffeine, no preservatives..."<br /><br />Nice light refreshing taste.  While great all by itself, it also makes a nice mixer (Mixed it with Mango flavored vodka and a squeeze of lime)

review/summary: Better Than Soda Pop, Not as Great as Water
review/text: These little cans of Izze sparkling grapefruit juices went into a big ice chest for a recent party, and I was stunned to see how popular they were among the tween-aged kids. Parents had no objections to the caffeine- and processed-sugar-free drinks, and they taste refreshing and crisp.<br /><br />That said, nothing beats water if you really want to have the perfect health drink. And I was frustrated to have chosen grapefruit flavor, which I had forgotten was off-limits to a family member because of medication restrictions. For those who want soda or energy drink, this won't be a replacement, in spite of those who would call it a healthy soda.<br /><br />Overall, however, these sparkling juices are a great summer choice. Refreshing, relatively healthy and super popular from kids to adults -- we'll be adding them to our future shopping lists for sure.

review/summary: Refreshing flavor, low carbonation
review/text: The Izze Sparkling Grapefruit is a refreshing, albeit sugar-loaded, soft drink that comes in a slender 8.4 ounce can.  Made with 70 percent fruit juice, no refined sugar, no caffeine, and no preservatives, this drink has a wonderfully tangy grapefruit scent and taste, although don't be fooled:  the juices (from concentrate) listed are, in order, white grape, apple, orange, and, finally, grapefruit.  The taste is more Orangina <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000121BY6">Sparkling Citrus Beverage with Pulp - 4 Glass Bottles</a> than Orange Crush -- in grapefruit form.  The carbonation is light, as is the flavor.  For those who want more nutrition than is usually found in soft drinks, the Izze fortifies its drink with Niacin, B6, and vitamin C, providing 10 percent RDA of each.<br /><br />The sugar content is only slightly lower than Coke , although the smaller size limits your intake, unless you're so thirsty that you need to drink two cans.  Oddly, though, it doesn't taste that sweet, perhaps because it is naturally sweet.  Each 8.4 ounce serving has 20 grams of sugar.<br /><br />This drink can be easily mimicked by adding seltzer water to grapefruit juice.  You'll get more vitamin C that way, although the convenience of chilled can with a pre-measured portion will appeal to many.

review/summary: This IZ Good!
review/text: We've walked by the bottled Izze products in our grocery store every week. They look good, but they were a little more expensive than a jug of 100% juice and some fizzy water (our soda alternative). Here comes Izze with 8.4 ounce cans and they package 24 for less than $22. So that's, what? Ninety cents a pop? (he he). We gave the grapefruit a try...<br /><br />WOW! It's like Squirt (my favorite soda before we foreswore the fizzy stuff to avoid high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners--one gives ya liver cancer + makes you fat & the other gives you brain cancer + keeps you thin, you choose!) Yes, like Squirt only all natural. AND it's got Vitamin C, B6 & Niacin...all for only 90 calories.<br /><br />It IS only 8.4 ounces and there's more apple juice in it than grapefruit juice...thus the four stars...but we do really like this product and this price. A good treat that's pretty good for you! (Strange fact, right now their website lists the ingredients including carrot juice, but on the back of my can it says radish juice--I never thought I like something with a radish in it!)<br /><br />We also tried the Green Apple variety. More grape than apple juice, but it tastes like those apple twist "malt beverages." The apple kind of wore out it's welcome more quickly than the grapefruit...but we are definitley looking forward to trying the other flavours!

review/summary: Syrupy taste - but filling
review/text: The main virtue these bars have is that they are useful snacks that don't tempt me to eat them up when I don't need them.  Bites with dried cranberries (maybe 3 to a bar) in them taste good enough - otherwise they taste like puffed rice drowned in syrup, which is pretty much what they are.  I prefer almost any of the other gluten-free bars I've tried - Gluten-Free Cafe lemon sesame bars, Larabars (all of them - especially apple pie), Kind fruit and nut bars, etc.  But these aren't terrible - and unlike the other bars named, they don't tempt me to snack on them when I'm at home and other food is available, which means I have them available for road trips when I need them.
