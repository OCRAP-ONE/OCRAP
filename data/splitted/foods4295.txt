review/text: Community makes great coffee, so thought I'd try their version of coffee creamer. I wasn't disappointed and the price is right on Amazon. I'm pretty sure I'll be making the switch from my usual brand, and sticking with Community Coffee Creamer from now on. I like my coffee strong, and this complements it very well.

review/summary: At least as good as Coffee Mate.
review/text: We use powdered creamer regularly in our household.  Typically this meant Coffee Mate, Cremora or occasionally a store brand at the expense of taste.  Decided to give this one a try recently as I tired of seeing Coffee Mate everywhere and watching its price increase.  Community Coffee is good coffee so how bad could their creamer bad.  Well ... actually pretty good.  At least as good as Coffee Mate, which puts it at the top of the heap for taste.  The only thing preventing 5 stars is the presence of hydrogenated oils.  Unfortunately ... they all have this and so you really can't avoid it without avoiding coffee creamer altogether.  For now at least - I'm making the switch to Community Coffee Creamer.

review/summary: WOW!  Really good stuff here ...
review/text: My quest for the perfect coffee may be over:  this is some seriously good coffee.  It's smooth -- no harshness or bitter "charred" aftertaste -- and full of rich coffee flavor.  I've been trying various brands and varieties of coffee for the past few years, and have landed on a few that suit my taste.  I don't like the burned flavor that too many coffees have (is it over-roasting?), or the rough acidic taste, so that rules out a lot of more popular brands (sorry, Starbucks).<br /><br />Obviously, everyone's taste is different, but if you're like me, and just want a full-flavored coffee without the bitterness, you might want to give this a try.  The price is very good, too.

review/summary: No inclusions of sand or shell fragments
review/text: Nothing is seriously wrong with these farmed oyster pieces from South Korea. There are no inclusions of sand or shell fragments. Just as clams are an extremely, extremely rich source of iron, oysters are an extremely, extremely rich source of zinc. The only problem might be that these oyster pieces are slightly less delicious than some brands of canned whole oysters. The reason might be that it is quite normal for whole oysters to be slightly better-tasting than oyster pieces.  Like most farmed oysters from South Korea, these oyster pieces are lighter in color than the darker-colored farmed oysters from China.  Unlike smoked oysters, which are high in cancer-causing nitrosamines and cancer-causing heterocyclic amines, these oyster pieces are quite good for your health. Oysters are extremely low in mercury and other marine pollutants and moderately high in the long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA.

review/text: I grew up in Alaska and fireweed honey was always considered the prime of all honey. The honeystix give you a wonderful sample of this delicacy that you can readily enjoy on it's own, or along with anything you desire to add it to or put it on. They are great for travel (I like to keep some in our RV), and provide a wonderful energy boost when you're on the run.<br /><br />My only complaint would be that you pretty much need a pair of scissors to open them - it would be nice if there was an easier way to get them open for times when scissors aren't handy.

review/summary: Good healthy pancakes and waffles
review/text: Update: even though these are more moist than other buckwheat mixes I've used they're still "buckwheat dry." However, we just invested in a "higher-priced" (high temperature) Belgin waffle maker (on sale of course) and I modified one of the included recipes with EXCEPTIONAL results. Try a recipe that uses yeast if you haven't, and if you can get the liquid/oil ratios right you won't be disappointed. I haven't tried the "whipped egg-white" recipes yet but now that I see the difference we'll be doing those next weekend (4th of July waffles!). I also tried Allie's basic recipe in the new "higher-priced" maker and it was better than our old "lower-priced" maker that finally died on us. So, good buckwheat waffles seem to be a combination of modifying the recipe and having a high-powered iron. I'll tell you this - I'll never make out-of-the-box waffles again without modifying the recipes.<br /><br />Original review: These are great - I will always have a couple of boxes on hand. They're better than the grocery store buckwheat pancakes, which contain wheat (this doesn't), because they are lighter and more moist. I still haven't been able to make them as light and fluffy as Krusteaz but I'm working on it.

review/summary: Eternal Hoax
review/text: This company makes two versions of its product.  Version one is labeled natural spring water from New Zealand.  This version 1 has a great taste and justifies its cost.  The second version packaged by the same company with the same product name and appearance is "vaporized water" with minerals added.  This version 2 tastes like distilled water.  They have identical packaging and only by carefully reading the label can you notice the difference.  This company is very disingenuous to its vendors and customers, as I have gone to Whole Foods to purchase this product and they did not know that there is a difference and mixed the two versions on the shelf.  Typically when you see the name New Zealand on the label you are getting true spring water.  What I received was distilled water even though the picture shows the New Zealand name.  Most of the Eternal water  that you find is the distilled version.  Therefore it is impossible to purchase this product without actually seeing it before you buy.  You must assume that if you are purchasing this product over the internet that you are getting distilled water.

review/text: We've purchased this water about 5 times and up until delivery #5, we received New Zealand Natural Artesan Water, PH 8.0 (outstanding taste).  The other reviewers are correct -- they changed the packaging ever so slightly and now they're shipping vapor distilled water from Walnut Creek, California! The taste difference is night and day, and needless to say the California water is an inferior substitute.<br /><br />This company is misleading in their claims -- they are selling the same Eternal water from California that can be purchased from chains like Fresh n' Easy (at double the price) and trying to pass it off as superior water from New Zealand.<br /><br />We'd ask for a refund, but we got juked on this last shipment and opened the packaging before discovering the truth. Thumbs down ~ not an eternal customer anymore...<br /><br />Where is the seller's integrity? Not sure...<br /><br />Why doesn't Amazon monitor this type of illegal activity? Thumbs down, Amazon.

review/text: My wife discovered the Danielle Sweet Mango Chips at a Cost Plus World Market.  I hate to think of the fuel we burned going to every one of their markets in the Seattle area looking for more.<br /><br />The Mango chips are outstanding - intense flavor, good crunch - with the added bonus of being sugar,gluten and preservative free.<br /><br />Having owned a restaurant in Mexico which had a huge mango tree in the patio. I learned how great the naturally ripened fruit really tastes. Most of the mangos we find in markets here are still green and lack the mature, well-developed flavor of tree-ripened fruit. The Danielle Sweet Mango Chips capture the pure essence of ripe mango flavor!<br /><br />We'll be setting up a recurring order with Amazon so that we'll never have to be without our favorite snack.

Perfect for adding to breakfasts, salads, desserts, or straight out of the bag as a healthy snack.  So glad I didn't wait on my Whole Foods to start offering these.

review/text: These are a great gluten free snack!  I eat them alone or add them as a topping on yogurt.  They are crunchy, slightly salty/sweet, not greasy and travel well in a hot car. If you like coconut, I bet you will be a fan of these chips!  Be advised, if you are expecting these to be the size of a potato chip, they aren't.  They are big rectangular shreds about an inch long.

review/text: Danielle coconut chips are the best things ever in life.  I first found them at a airport gift shop on a phoenix layover and I've been addicted ever since.  They carry these at Whole Foods, but the supply is always sketchy and random, so ordering them online in a 6 pack always seems like a good option.<br /><br />Here are the flavors that I really like:<br />1. Coconut - the best ever<br />2. Mango<br />3. Honey Banana<br />4. Tangy Pineapple<br />5. Sweet Potato<br /><br />The okra ones are okay, so are the taro and the durian, I find the jackfruit ones disgusting, the pumpkin ones are gross and the carrot ones are SUPER icky (but I despise carrots, so I may be biased)

review/summary: I've gone Bananas over these Banana Chips!!!!
review/text: My first exposure to these chips was at a local gourmet deli.  I hestitated to purchase them due to the price ($3.25 for a 2 oz bag) but I bought them anyway.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!  These taste nothing like any banana chip I have ever tasted.  They are simply DELICIOUS!!!  The flavor is sweet but non-geasy and the chips have a nice crunch with a light as air puffy texture.  The Ingredients: Just fresh Bananas and palm oil - that's it.  No preservatives - No Trans fat.  The only down side is the price, HOWEVER, if you order them through Amazon's subscription service you will get them at a better price.(you can choose how often you want them delivered).  I couldn't wait to place my order and now I will be receiving them on a regular basis.  TRY them, you won't be dissapointed!

review/text: It's pretty expensive considering how much chips is actually in the package. But, it tastes great (similar to durian chips I've had in Thailand) & healthy to boot. If you've never tried durian / heard notorious things about the fruit / hated how the actual fruit tasted, fear not! It doesn't taste/smell remotely like the fruit: more like non-oily potato chips with a smooth buttery aftertaste.

review/text: I usually don't like artificial coconut flavored stuff, but this roasted coconut chip is soooo good. I ate the 1 whole bag on my way to work, though I do not recommend doing that. The chips are crispy and sweet, with a strong coconut flavor. I would give the jackfruit one a try if Amazon sells the 6-packs rather than the 20-packs one. In short, if you like coconut in general, or even if you are not a big fan of coconut, give it a try and you will be amazed!!

review/text: I first purchased this Danielle product at all places, Marshalls. I was on my way to the movies, and was looking for something to munch on, and somehow found this bag to look appetizing.  I immediately opened in my car to see if I was gonna like this hidden snack before I got all comfy during coming attractions.<br />Oh WOW...I was hooked.  I literally had to force myself to stop eating, and wait until I got to the movies.  It took a lot of restraint, and (I'm a picky foodie when it comes to snacks.)  I enjoyed every little tidbit of Coconut in the bag, and was sad when it was gone.<br />When the movie ended, I googled where I can find this snack, and found out it was only sold in stores in the New York area.  Somehow Marshalls ended up with this product due to some overstock not sold, or in some other capacity.  I hit the Marshalls the next day, and sadly found all the Coconut sold out.  I purchased the Pineapple in hopes it had the same kind of taste the Coconut had, but no...it was horrible.<br />I've been looking high and low for this at other local Marshalls, but no luck.  I finally caved in, and purchased here.  I'm excitedly waiting for my 12 bag order.<br />If you LOVE Coconut as much as I do, you will truly love this snack.  I agree with others, for the price, the bag should have a bit more to enjoy.

Was excited to find out they are! They're basically shaved pieces of coconut that are baked/roasted. Ingredients listed on the bag are fresh coconuts, sugar, and salt. They're delicious and have the perfect crunch! As a bonus, they're a natural treat. I eat them as a snack all by themselves; my toddler loves them too! The six-pack will last us quite a while.

review/text: We're on vacation in Maui and I happened to pick up a bag Danielle's coconut chips from a shave ice vendor down the street. I LOVE coconut but get discouraged by all the over-sugared options. These are WONDERFUL! I have 2-year-old twin boys, and I couldn't get them to stop eating them. I was so eager to get my hands on more that I emailed our local Whole Foods from the beach, only to find out that they don't carry the coconut flavor. I begged them to reconsider - but then I discovered that Amazon carries them, so all my troubles are over. :) Really, if you like coconut, give these a try! (By the way, the mango is delicious, too!)

I've recently introduced them to three different family members who ordered them immediately upon trying them.  The texture and flavor are wonderful...tiny little ribbons of crisp coconut.  And the whole bag is only 250 calories.  Yes, the bag is small, especially for the price, but they are worth it.  I can't recommend these enough.

review/text: We're staying at Stanford's Children's Hospital with my son, and I'm sure I don't have to elaborate how 'pleasant' hospital cafeteria food can be, even at a 'great' cafeteria (as hospital cafeteria's go, Stanford's is actually very good. But it is still cafeteria food). On weekends the Children's side cafeteria closes down so you have to go over to the main hospital's cafeteria for dinner. Grabbed a turkey sandwich and was looking for some chips or something crunchy, and I saw these. I'm a big coconut fan so I figured I couldn't go wrong, and it's healthier than potato chips so I'm game. I made the mistake of trying a bite of them before I had my sandwich, I didn't want to put the bag down! Holy smokes, seriously the best 'chip substitute' I've ever had, and if they weren't so expensive I'd switch over from potato chips completely!! Perfect combination of salty/sweet, loads of coconut flavor (I've had some where it's really subtle and mild, this definitely is not), great size strips (like someone said, looks like they put it through a strip paper shredder just a bit wider), perfect crunchiness. Anyways, definitely a rare treat because of the expense, but so worth every penny! I may have to grab another bag for the road home though before we get discharged this afternoon. ; )

I do, however, want to let others know that the amount per package is really small, the pieces are also not very large (after a short time of nibbling you almost feel as though you should have just bought a package of shredded coconut from the local market and toasted it in your oven... or even had purchased a fresh coconut)... as far as "bang for your buck" these got a thumbs down for me. I have no problem spending more money for healthy goods for my family, I see it as a very worthy splurge - but, these left me disappointed... bag full of air and a small palm-ful of toasted coconut...  :(

review/text: These bully sticks are definitely not "thick".  The package I received was full of bully sticks which were thinner than those pictured.  They were also a little smellier than prior suppliers I have bought from.  Overall disappointed in the quality but even 50 thin bully sticks for $128 isn't the worst deal ever so I won't bother returning them.

review/text: My two basenjis had a few guests over last week end and came the time to share a few bully sticks the atmosphere was electric!  Everybody was sitting nicely, some of them were holding their paw in the air as if to say:" me first, me first!!!" The noses were twitching, the tongues were meticulously run over them, turning every piece of olfactive information into tasty dribble. Anxious eyes, opened socket expanding  wide, the wait was unbearable! After a few seconds of this gleeful spectacle I handed the treats out. Everybody grabbed theirs, there were a few side glances, a couple were dropped but immediately retrieved, nerves you see, and after one or two growls the chewing began. It sounded like a mini munching factory. The stench was heavenly and when every little fiber had been devoured we all cheered for ValueBull. Tree times.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: Our fat orange tabby had been on Science Diet all 9 years of his life. He started hurling on the carpet more then usual (usual being kitty revenge for some slight) so we contacted my boyfriend's sister who has been a vet for over 15 years. She said sometimes manufacturers just change the ratios or ingredients in a cat food and it doesn't set well with some consumers. Eukanuba was one of the recommended brands -- a kennel I worked at in college swore by it -- so we weaned him onto it and no issues since. I'd recommend it solely because he's picky ( hates treats, milk, cream, tuna fish oil ... Everything ) and because it settled his stomach.

review/summary: Bloody Stool and Vomiting.
review/text: I have a 12 year old female who is over 15 pounds and my vet recommended a lower fat dry food.  I switched to this food and for about 8 months did not notice any improvement in her weight.  What I did notice was at least 3 times a week blood outside her litter box after she had a bowel movement and a regular routine of vomiting. I became alarmed and brought her to my vet.  After a full "costly" check up, he asked me what food she was on.  When I told him he told me that it was not the first time he heard of problems with this brand.  I started giving her 1/2 and 1/2 wet food in the morning and Innova Cat and Kitten in the evening, problem totally solved!  It's been over a month and not only are the bloody stools gone, but no more throwing up.  Be very cautious with this food.

review/summary: Not worth the price
review/text: Eukanuba is a well-respected name in pet foods, and it's a bit pricier than some other big brands.  So when we wanted to switch our cat Caesar from Iam's and saw this on sale, I figured that I was getting quite a bargain.  Oh the folly...<br /><br />Chicken by-product meal, Corn grits and corn meal are three of the four top ingredients.  This is what the high cost buys - by-products and corn?  If we wanted to continue giving him crappy ingredients then we'd have kept buying Iams and saved the cash (not to mention the fact that Caesar actually liked it)!  I imagine the weight-loss claim is probably true, because my cat would eat just enough of this to get by...he hated it!  We decided to change to a new brand after half a bag, phasing the new food in with the Eukanuba  in growing proportions.  Throughout this short period, the kibble from the other brand was always gone first.<br /><br />If Caesar had liked it, I probably wouldn't stick with it on principle...I don't think I should pay top-dollar for substandard ingredients.  Luckily, Caesar came to that conclusion all by himself!

Beer and Soda are the two things that come to mind. If you're looking for something in the 750,000 SHU to 1,000,000 SHU range though, go elsewhere. If I had to guess, I'd put this hot sauce at 300,000 SHU at best.

review/summary: Great hot sauce
review/text: I bought this sauce months ago when I saw it in a shop.  I like to spice up my foods quite a bit and was skeptical about this product since it doesn't seem like any other hot sauce I've had.  It has a very thin base and seems watery so it can splash out quickly.  Packs nice heat but can easily be over applied.<br /><br />When I don't feel like using a habanero sauce or something with a stronger pepper taste, this is the perfect fill in.  You get nice heat without changing too much of your meals flavor.  I've put this on all kinds of food and never really found any disappointment.  Time to order my 2nd bottle through Amazon!

review/text: These are quick and easy. They are also the perfect size for my little ones. The regular size ones are just a little too big for my three year old. So I like these because he can eat them without me having to cut them in half for him. They are also the perfect size for my one year old. They both like them. However, they don't taste the micro bites in the can. To me they taste a little more bitter, but the kids like them so I guess that's what matters. There is kind of a lot of sauce, but I just drain a little before I serve it to my kids. It's not too much.

review/text: To make this edible, I found I had to drain off over half the watery brownish sauce -- otherwise it was more like a soup.  This was not what I expected from this "micro ravioli" product, which is nothing like the "mini ravioli" I am used to.  The flavor of the sauce was bland and not as tomato-y as mini ravioli.  The ravioli themselves seem to have no filling to speak of.

Thick, dark. wonderful chocolate coated crisp, delectable honeycomb candy. Best of all, this is actually a LOW CALORIE snack! TWO big hunks were less than 200 calories, and believe me, one huge piece was more than enough to satisfy any cravings! I keep it in the fridge, to preserve the chocolate, and that seems to make the candy a lot harder to eat fast, since you have to nibble at it.

The beans smell absolutely heavenly when ground!<br /><br />It works best for me when brewed as a pour over or in a french press. I was not as pleased with it in a moka pot or as espresso on its own. However, it did work well in a moka pot when blended with some very dark roasted Columbian beans which were a bit too harsh on their own.<br /><br />This is the second variety of Weaver's decaf I've tried and have been 100% satisfied with both.

review/summary: Stopped the Hairballs
review/text: During the hair shedding season, my long haired cat was getting hairballs twice a week.  I gave her Laxatone and hairball relief treats to help it stop.  I also brushed her daily.  These things helped a little, but the Royal Canin Hairball Food helped the most.  Now, she almost never gets hairballs, even if I don't brush her often.  What's more, she's a picky eater, and she loves this food.  If you are experiencing hairball problems with your cat, I'd recommend this as something to try.  It worked for us!
