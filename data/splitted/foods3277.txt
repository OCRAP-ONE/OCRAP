review/summary: Fantastic Beverage
review/text: I had been trying out various drinks looking for a guilt free solution to my unhealthy habit of diet soda. We have great water at home from a deep, deep well and it tastes wonderful but I found that I was still too tempted by the satisfaction carbonation gives me getting through a long day. I was going to try some regular club soda but came across the Crystal Geyser Mineral Water and plopped it in my grocery cart instead.  So glad I did! It is so satisfying, even the unflavored kind, and I'm now thrilled to have a 0 calorie tasty drink that does not include all the acidic and health-damaging ingredients of soda. This keeps me from eating out of boredom too.  Plus, my grocery store carries this 42.27 ounce bottle for just 89 cents each, a much better buy than amazon... but because I love amazon and am a Prime member, I did come here to see if it would be worth it to purchase from them. In most cases they have a better deal but I'm guessing with the weight and special considerations of shipping bottled water, it can't happen.

review/summary: The Best Cinnamon Tea
review/text: This is the best, without a doubt.  Some tea that you get is supposed to be cinnamon and it tastes so very artificial.  This is real cinnamon, and of flavored black teas, it's my number 1.

review/summary: My Favorite
review/text: This tea is pure cinnamon bliss. It's the only tea that I find tastes best with no sugar or cream, as the cinnamon naturally sweetens it and milk would decrease the flavor. The best way that I can describe the taste is much like a 'red hot' candy. It's just "wow". Wonderful.

review/summary: My favorite tea!
review/text: I first discovered hot cinnamon sunset tea last winter while i was studying at B&N.  I needed something warm and comforting so I chose to try this tea and I was hooked!!!  I immediately purchased two tins so that I may enjoy it at home.  I wish I could find the tea in bulk however. It gets a little pricey and I don't need multiple tins.  Oh well, it's delicious nonetheless!  I don't drink any other hot tea anymore.  Sometimes I'll even bring a sachet to a restaurant and just ask for hot water.  :-)

review/summary: I Hate Tea, but...
review/text: I was in a tea room in St. Augustine with my mother and the man running the place asked if we would like to sample some tea. My response was, "no thank you, actually I hate tea... I've never found a tea that tastes like anything more than lightly-flavored hot water." So the man said, well just give me a minute and I'll bring you a tea that you'll like.  He brought us each a cup of Hot Cinnamon Sunset.  I was instantly hooked!  No sugar, no milk, no honey, just water and tea.  This tea is lovely.  You don't need anything in it and the longer you steep the bag (in no more than 6 oz. of water) the better it is.  So, I guess I can't say I don't drink tea anymore.  I'm out of that first box of tea and I am now ordering more.  Even if you don't like tea give this a try you might be surprised.

review/text: I bought this tea after my wife brought a couple of sachets home from a friend. I am not a huge fan of hot tea, but this cinnamon tea is wonderful. It is just strong enough to really enjoy. It also smells great. Now that the weather is cooling down again, I'm back in the mood for more tea. The 20 sachets were gone long ago, so I guess it is time to buy some more. The canister is also very nice - this would make a great gift for that hot tea lover in your family!

review/text: Without a doubt this Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Sunset Tea has spoiled me from ever wanting to have any other tea! This is a very smooth and delicious tea that is so aromatic that it fills the room with the scent of cinnamon. It tastes divine and with a touch of honey I don't even want dessert- THIS IS dessert :) Best tea ever- and now I am a 'tea-snob' having tried this! Ordered two more after receiving the first tin! If you like cinnamon, you will LOVE this.

review/text: In short, this beats all the other teas.  I'm an everyday tea drinker but tend to shy away from flavored teas.  I was introduced to Harney and Sons by their fabulous Earl Grey Supreme.  While the Earl and I will remain good friends, this has become my new favorite tea for when I really have time to savor it.  From the scent to the flavor I can't get enough.  This isn't cinnamon roll cinnamon, more of a red-hot cinnamon flavor that is just strong enough to not hide the delicious tea.  Perfection unsweetened, and ambrosia when a little honey is added.  Great stuff.

review/summary: ripoff & strange reviews
review/text: taste & packaging were high quality but product is overpriced compared to "Hot Cinnamon Spice". Per Harney & Sons web site, the two products are EXACTLY THE SAME. Read their FAQ's & one of the first FAQ is PRECISELY about this. Unless a reviewer (AROBINSON in "Hot Cinnamon Spice" review, compared Spice & Sunset in a different package (sachet or teabag or loose leaf), there is absolutely no logical reason for the difference in taste (AND much higher price). I enjoyed the taste but felt it left a clove after-taste more than cinnamon. Seems like Harney is a quality Company with helpful info on the site but having 2 different names for the same EXACT product is strange/misleading. I am sorry I believed a review that lead me to think that there were 2 different products -- thanks! Product deserves 4 stars but I get crabby when I have been misled.

review/text: I bought this sampler for my Mother and she loved it. This is a woman who does not function without two or three pots of coffee a day so she knows her coffee. As for me, I am not much of a coffee drinker but I tried most of the flavors and thought that they were very good without being overly strong. We got about two pots (8 to 12 cups) per bag without the coffee being too watered down. Definitely a hit with any coffee drinkers in your life. I sprung for the gift wrapping and was not disappointed. Be warned though, the box it is shipped in will have the name of the company and what is inside of it, so if you are trying to surprise someone maybe have it shipped to a friends house first. Otherwise very happy with the product.

Adding green tea back into a flavorful, fruity mixture like this makes it very healthy.<br /><br />What a great idea Harney & Sons!

review/text: The other packaging (4 bag shipment) has tons of reviews of the coffee for your reference.  I have been drinking this coffee for over 50 years.  My mother used to get it at the A&P and have it ground there, but now I grind it myself.  It is reliably decent, vastly better than buying preground coffee, and vastly cheaper than some premium coffee beans.  Since I drink a lot of coffee, the 6 bag shipment is a great deal.  I recommend trying this product to anyone who wants to brew freshly ground coffee at a reasonable price.

review/summary: A Perfect Blend!
review/text: If you are making a salad, a sprinkling of these wonderfully blended Italian seasonings are just right.  I love the mozzarella and tomato salad with a little olive oil and the seasonings on top.  They are the best Italian blend of seasonings that I've ever used.  The flavor is wonderful.  I use fresh herbs when possible, but these definitely are a great substitute!

review/summary: Not bad, not fab
review/text: While at my friendly neighborhood Uwajimaya, I happened upon this freak of nature: the Komforte Chockolates Ramen Noodle bar.<br /><br />After staring in dull incomprehension for some time, with occasional muttered interjections of "the hell?" and "but WHY?" and so forth, I bought it and took it home. Really, how could you not?<br /><br />When first opened, the bar looked pretty much like your run-of-the-mill fancy-pants chocolate bar; no sign of eight-for-a-dollar pasta in evidence.  Ah, but when I snapped off a piece, the mysterious amendment was revealed! It appeared to be in the same pre-fried but uncooked form that comes straight from the bag, with which starving students everywhere are intimately familiar.<br /><br />There was nothing left to do but try it. *nosh*<br /><br />The ramen noodles in this chocolate are pretty few and far between, offering more texture than taste; the texture itself is something akin to soft nuts or cornflakes. The shape, size and markings on the bar strongly suggest that Komforte is made and/or owned by the same outfit that makes Seattle Chocolates.<br /><br />The quality of the chocolate itself is pretty good. It's good enough that it could stand on its own without playing up the quirk factor (Komforte's other offbeat chocolate bar flavors include French Toast and Tortilla Lime + Salt), but then they probably wouldn't be able to command premium prices for these chocolate bars. I'll probably try the others just to see what they're like, but I suspect the novelty factor wears off pretty quickly -- and then all you have left to market is an overpriced chocolate bar.<br /><br />(This review was originally published in slightly modified form at the author's blog, Confessions of a Laundry Faerie.)

review/text: I have no idea who had the idea to mix ramen noodles in chocolate, but it was a brilliant one. The chocolate is perfect and the ramen is not overwhelming, just a hint of crunchy running through the bar. I bought these as stocking stuffers for my kids, but wound up adding a few to my own stocking because they were delicious.

review/text: My daughter & I love Indian food, but neither of us likes really spicy food. We've expanded our palates, but I still have to tone down the amount of seasonings I use. We had Patak's Butter Chicken last night & it was AWESOME! It made it so easy to have Indian-style food. We just added some basmati rice and naan bread for a delicious meal at home. The nearest Indian restaurant is over 50 miles away so I really appreciate being able to have something I can make at home.

review/summary: Easy to make and very tasty!
review/text: I love Indian food and when I discovered Patak's cooking sauces it allowed me have delicious Indian food at home with very little effort. Butter Chicken sauce is a mild creamy tomato source and various spices. I am am able to get 3 or 4 dinners out of one jar container.<br /><br />I use Butter Chicken Curry sauce as a base and add the following ingredients: coconut milk, cilantro, and garlic.<br />I typically make either chicken or lamb cut up in small pieces. I also often add vegetable into the same pan, potatoes and onions work very well. Sometimes I also like adding broccoli, cauliflower or chickpeas for variety.<br /><br />The best price for this sauce I found in a local Indian store. They have a very large variety of Patak's sauces: different flavors and different hotness. I usually buy a large variety and store unopened jars in the basement. They keeps very well for a long time.<br /><br />I have tried a variety of Indian cooking sauces and Patak's is my favorite.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: It had been awhile since having Buttered Chicken and being unable to locate the sauce in a local store, I found it online. I had to buy a 6 jar package of it but figured I'd have it when the craving returned at a later date. Upon arrival, I opened the package and was extremely disappointed to see that the jars were covered with old, hard sauce. It was like the jars had been frozen at some point and the contents forced out from under the lids as the sauce expanded. Not sure if air had spoiled the sauce or it was compromised in some way as not to healthy to ear, I threw them all away. Extremely disappointed that whoever packed those jars for shipment would gave chosen them considering the condition of the jars.

review/text: The candy must be wet to scrape off all the paper that is left behind after the wrapper is removed. Only one in five has the wrapper coming off completely and easily. Too darn much trouble. If you don't get the paper off, the result is candy with bumpy little ridges in it from the paper left behind. Nasty! Buy the bigger "bars" instead. They are wrapped in plastic which comes off easily. The flavor is good. Not exactly like it was fifty years ago but close enough.

But I can say I order expited shipping at extra cost so it would arrive in time for Father's Day, which it did.  What I was extremely pleased about was that the shipper realized it could be shipped in the same amount of time at a regular shipping rate and refunded me the extra cost.  Now that is the way business should be done!  Thank you.  Pending a good review from Dad, I will pick some of this up myself.  ;-)

review/summary: very refreshing little candy!
review/text: Researched and tried every xylitol hard candy in an attempt to alleviate dry mouth and save my teeth in the process. Xylitol candies are hard to come by and ones not made in China are even moreso. The Ricochet line is made in the US and is excellent quality. It is a dense little powdery "mint" as opposed to a hard candy - there must be a real difficulty in melting xylitol and making it into a "suckable" hard candy - so one has to get used to the more rapidly dissolving "powdery" kind. That said, this rasberry sour is by far the best flavor, but that might be just my personal preference. However, everyone in the family, from grandchildren to husband, all say "yes" when I offer them some! Even tho there's a hundred or so in the container. I get these on autoship because I never want to be without them.

review/summary: I prefer Xyloburst Berry mints...
review/text: These taste okay, but dissolve very fast. For Xylitol, I prefer Xyloburst Berry mints that take longer to dissolve, or you can chew them if you like.<br /><br />It's like this - when I first got these, I over-ate them. The dentist says to consume 6-10 mg of Xylitol per day for your teeth. Each piece of these candies contains .4 mg, and 1 tin has 100 pieces, or 40 mg. Too much Xylitol isn't dangerous, but it can cause uncomfortable bowel changes, which is what happened to me. So now I'm more cautious about it.<br /><br />My strategy now, is to have some candies that are easy to consume (like these) to get my 6-10 mg a day of Xylitol, as well as some other very yummy ones that have low Xylitol for the amount of time it takes to consume them, like Dr. John's lozenge shape hard candies or Sparx. I've got a candy bowl set out that starts out with a dozen .5 mg Xyloburst berry mints in it, that I either eat or substitute for other candies during the day, to keep track of the Xylitol, and I haven't had any more problems with eating too much of it this way. (I don't keep track of the hard candies or Sparx - I eat whatever I want of those.)<br /><br />FYI, Dr. John's website also sells Xylitol lemonade that's interesting to try. I've found it can be mixed different strengths according to your taste and mood, and leaves me wanting plain water afterwards rather than another sweet drink.

review/text: When I went off white sugar and artificial sweeteners several years ago I knew I would miss carbonated beverages. I have tried other brands but Blue Sky Free is by far the best. My favorite flavor is Cherry Vanilla Creme. Refreshing without any unpleasant aftertaste like other brands. My local source stopped carrying this flavor so I was delighted when I found this on Amazon, and the subscription makes it less expensive than what I used to spend.

review/summary: Really, really good!
review/text: My husband brought home a six pack of this a week or so ago and it is awesome! I knew Blue Sky had been around for years, but this was the first time I had seen their "Free" drinks. I'm glad I tried it! This will definitely be on my grocery list from now on. They have a Creamy Root Beer, which is really good, as well. I've tried the cola, but I'm not big on sugar free colas, so it wasn't my favorite. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, yet, but I plan to soon. =)

review/text: I love the way these taste ice cold. One of my all-time favorites. And the best thing? It's calorie free. Just like the Zevia, though, it is not very budget friendly if you are a heavy soda drinker. I'm no doctor, but I would still, however, recommend treating yourself to a Blue Sky at least twice a week. =)

review/text: I loved this soda immediately, and it didn't taste a thing like cough syrup to me. It has a marvelous flavor with a subtle hint of vanilla in the background. Pure bliss.<br /><br />I have been drinking another stevia-sweetened soda which is much more expensive, and I just cancelled my subscriptions to that one and switched to this one.

review/text: I was excited to find a soda made with Truvia. I ordered a 24 pack cans using Prime and got it the next day.<br /><br />The flavor of the soda isn't bad, but there isn't much fizz to it. It kind of reminds me of the soda you left sitting out and are so thirsty the next morning you take a drink anyway.<br /><br />The cherry vanilla is pronounced and may be a bit too strong for some, but it was the fizz that I missed the most.<br /><br />I might try a different flavor, but will buy a smaller quantity to test it out.

review/text: I love blue sky products and was very glad to see my favorites offered as zero calorie.  Unfortunately I didn't read the full description.  They use Stevia, the new sugar substitute.  I don't know about the rest of the world but it has a bitter after taste I can't tolerate.  They don't taste bad at first but I am not a fan of that sweetener.  Just FYI.  I don't suppose I can return a case with one can empty so I will save it for guests.

She texted me a few days ago that I have ruined her for "regular honey" as she had just made a simple salad (greens, green onions, walnuts and crumbled good quality bleu cheese)  dressed with this honey and fresh squeezed meyer lemon juice. I have since tried it and it is everything she said and more (I threw in a diced organic pear for an over the top add on). It pays to use top products--the ingredients speak for themselves! We love Monastiri honey here in Sacramento. I can't wait to try it this summer with our luscious tomatoes----give it a try.

review/summary: Not a huge energy boost, but convenient for short-term perk
review/text: I tend not to use energy drinks or boosters, but recently tried Monster Hitman's shooters to enhance my energy level before working out with weights and/or doing a long cardio session.  For me, it's a mixed bag of good and so-so, but nothing really bad.<br /><br />The taste is very sweet - I think it tastes 'just like' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00065KBIK">Otter Pops 12/18 ct. Box</a>.  I'm not kidding... just like 'em!  Takes me back to hot summers in the 80's, which is not entirely a bad thing.  Being a shooter it's about two swallows and it's down, so even those who find it too sweet shouldn't have a problem taking this drink down.<br /><br />The energy boost comes primarily from B vitamins and caffeine.  It's recommended that you don't use any more than one in a 4hr period of time, or ingest other caffeinated beverages.  I drink it after my morning cup of coffee and haven't noticed any nervousness or increase in heart rate, thus I believe the amount of caffeine is probably minimal for most users.  Kids however shouldn't use this product.<br /><br />Taken approximately 15 minutes prior to a workout I notice I'm more alert and energized for about an hour, but a significant dip in that energy occurs during a hard workout.  I eat a small breakfast prior to drinking this shot and workout for approximately 90 minutes on weight days, 40 minutes on cardio days - totaling 5 workouts a week.  I used this for both, but found I liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003BDH16E">Celsius Calorie Burner Green Tea Raspberry Acai 15/12oz</a> much better for energy on weight training days because it seems to hold my energy better than this product.  Monster Hitman shooter is good for a boost before a 3 to 5 mile run, because it doesn't add too much fluid to your system (limiting the need to urinate) and because it gives you a boost as promised.<br /><br />Ginsing, taurine, B2, B3, B6, B12 and the 'energy blend' are all effective and so far, I've not found any side-effects using this product other than a headache if I take it on an empty stomach.  No stomach upset, just the headache.<br /><br />The reason I give it 4 versus 5 stars is more about the duration of the effectiveness - I think the boost's longevity - at least for me, is very limited.

I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.

review/summary: So glad I found these oyster crackers!
review/text: Keebler Oyster Crackers have been a favorite of mine for years.  They are buttery, crunchy and absolutely the best I have ever tasted!  Then, that familiar red box became harder and harder to find in local stores in metro Atlanta.  I could occasionally find boxes at Publix, but then they dissapeared.  After months of frustration I found a Publix Manager and asked him why they no longer carried Keebler Oyster Crackers.  He dissapeared for about 10 minutes, returned with a puzzled face and said "they have been discontinued.  I just checked with my distributor."  WHAT?!!  You are kidding me, right?  Well, maybe they have been discontinued in Atlanta. Or, maybe they have been discontinued in boxes.  But, it just didn't make sense to me that Keebler would discontinue their oyster crackers all together...<br /><br />This is why I checked to see if Amazon offered these crackers.  Amazon did, and after about 2 years of frustration I  ordered these crackers right away!  I was thrilled to see them offered! Plus, they came to my front door in a few days.<br /><br />These 0.5 oz. packs are just right and go great with any soup or chili.  The price was good too.<br /><br />You can bet that I will order these again!

review/text: I really hate leaving a bad review; this ad is misleading, and just plain wrong. This is NOT an issue of the product being bad.  It is an issue of the information given in the ad is misleading and untrue.  I cannot give it 5 stars, since I did NOT get what I expected to get, regardless of whether or not the bone is good. (I would not be leaving this feed back if this ad had been corrected. I asked that the ad be corrected, so that others are not misled too. I have waited over a week, and IT HAS NOT BEEN CORRECTED! So I feel I must share this information with others.)<br /><br />I ordered this product because the ad said that the retail value was $57.60, at a cost of $1.72.  It goes on to say that you are saving 97%.  I should have known that it was UNTRUE, but I read on and the more I read, I began to believe that it was a closeout item, and a good deal.<br /><br />They talk about "femur bones" (PLURAL); and the shipping weight is "1 pound;" as well as, the picture shows you 3 bones. So I assumed at the very least I would get 3 bones, and it was a reasonable, if I got free shipping by meeting their minimum.  Since I could not envision 3 bones having a retail value was $57.60; so I ordered, the "bones" with the hope that there were more. I assumed that this must be a closeout, and I thought I was going to get a good deal.  WHAT I GOT was 1 femur bone, if I had known it was ONE bone, I would NOT have ordered. ONE bone with a retail value of $57.60?????<br /><br />To the company's credit, they did refund me when I complained about being misled by the information in the ad. I have not seen the correction on my billing yet, but I would assume that since they told me it was being issued, that it will be on my next statement.<br /><br />Please note: You are NOT getting a good buy, or what you think you will get when ordering this product.  Since you get ONE bone; I believe that this one 6 oz bone at $1.72, plus $5.49 shipping is too expensive.  You are paying($7.21) for one bone that would cost $2.00 or less at a pet store.
