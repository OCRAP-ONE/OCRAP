review/summary: Promotes Breastmilk Supply
review/text: I read on a breastfeeding website that you should take a bit more of this supplement than is listed on the bottle's directions. On day 1, I took 3 pills, 3 times per day, and the following day I pumped 6 more ounces of milk! I took the same amount of pills the 2nd day, and only 3 pills on the 3rd day. On days 2 and 3, I didn't pump because I was at home, but I was able to feed my baby without supplementing with formula. It was a 5-day holiday weekend, and at no time did I need to supplement, nor did I take any additional pills after those first 3 days. After the 5-day holiday, I pumped 16 ounces each day for 2 days in a row, and also breastfed my baby in the evenings when I got home from work with no problem. (That brings me to today, and I am still going strong.) Before that, I was lucky if I pumped 9-12 ounces! The side effects for me included that maple-syrup smell in urine/sweat, and it also upset my stomach, but it was only for a few days, so I thought it was worth it. The best thing is that, once your supply is increased, you can stop taking the pills.

review/summary: WARNING--DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO PEANUTS!
review/text: I hate to give a bad review since I have no idea if it actually works to improve milk production (which is why I purchased it). I just feel the need to share that I took one dose and experienced a fairly severe allergic reaction. It was 2am and I went online and discovered that fenugreek is in the same plant family as peanuts (and chickpeas). This is not marked anywhere on the label, on Amazon's page, or on Nature's Way's website.

review/summary: made my boobs bigger*WORKS W/MOTHERS MILK TEA
review/text: this stuff did not do much to help me make more milk. it did however make my boobs look bigger. also me and my daughter smelled like maple syrup. i could even smell it when i went to restroom. if i wiped under my arms, i smelled maple syrup. i took 4 capsules every 8 hours. i used the gnc fenugreek though. i am waiting on my mother's milk tea to come in the mail. i will be writing a review on that when i get it. hope that works better.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br />I have noticed that when I take fenugreek, or drink mother's milk tea, my daughter gets baby acne(really small cluster of bumps on her back and legs, nothing too scary). I also noticed that when I take less fenugreek pills with mother's milk tea, it does increase my supply. it takes about 1-2 days to increase it. i would go from 3 1/2( 1 1/2on the right and 2 on the left) ounces in one session all together from both breasts. to filling a 4 ounce bottle almost to the top in one session. this makes me very happy. the only problem is that it still gives my daughter baby acne, so i use every now and then. HOPE THAT HELPS!!!

review/summary: Works for me to increase breastmilk supply!
review/text: In preparation for going back to work, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep my breastmilk supply up to keep up with my baby.  I tried Motherlove More Milk Two Alcohol Free because Motherlove was recommended for increasing breastmilk supply in a pamphlet I got from my lactation consultant.  It didn't work for me.  So then I tried More Milk Plus Alcohol Free.  That also didn't work for me.  Finally after talking to a couple of people, they recommended Fenugreek, which I had read about before, but wanted to give Motherlove's More Milk product line a try because of all the great reviews I read.  I ordered Motherlove's Fenugreek, and finally my breastmilk supply started to go up.<br /><br />Before Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours on average and getting about 3 ounces total (1 to 1.5 oz on left side and 1.5 to 2 oz on right side).  By the time I finished a 4 oz bottle of Motherlove's Fenugreek, I was still pumping every 2.5 to 3 hours but getting 4 to 5 oz total (up to 2 oz on left side and 2 to 3 oz on right side).<br /><br />I was worried about keeping up with my baby, but now my baby can't keep up with me.  After using Fenugreek for about a month, I'll have about 2 dozen 4 oz bottles of unfrozen milk in the fridge on any given day and I now have almost 80 frozen 5oz bottles in the freezer, and running out of room to store any more!<br /><br />Note: Although your supply increases, it does eventually plateau.  After finishing the Motherlove's Fenugreek, I switched to Nature's Way Fenugreek capsules because they're a fraction of the price, and you can take them with meals.  Motherlove recommends you avoid water 20 minutes before and after taking their product.  The Nature's Way capsules is maintaining my supply that Motherlove's started.<br /><br />In fact, now that I'm back to work, after my last pump in the morning, it will be 6 to 8 hours before I get to pump again at lunch at work, then another 4 to 5 hours after that before I get to pump again when I return home.  I then pump every 3 to 5 hours from the time I get home to the last time before work in the morning.  Even though I'm pumping less often than before (before it was after each feeding every 2.5 to 3 hours in a 24 hour span), I'm still pumping a very minimum of 5 oz total.  For those the times I have to go longer between pumps (more than 6 hours) I will pump up to a maximum of 11 to 12 oz total depending on how long I had to go between pumps.

review/summary: It really works if you take it properly!
review/text: I'm a working mother who was suffering from a steadily decreasing milk supply after returning to work.  Despite pumping every three hours at work (for a total of 3 pumping sessions per day), I was starting to have to top off my baby's bottles with frozen milk from my freezer stash.  At first it was an extra ounce a day, then two, then three.  As any breastfeeding mother knows, that's a dangerous road to go down because it can lead to even more supply issues in the future.<br /><br />I decided to try supplementing with fenugreek, but because I am naturally very suspicious of supplements and worried about side effects, I did a ton of research on the pros/cons of fenugreek before starting supplementation.  My research suggests that fenugreek can have an effect on blood sugar levels, so people with blood sugar issues should consult a doctor before trying the supplement.  I've learned to minimize the blood sugar effects for myself by always taking my fenugreek right after eating my main meals.  This way, the blood sugar effects are more than offset by the food in my system.<br /><br />The biggest mistake people make when trying fenugreek to increase milk supply is to not take enough of the herb.  It is critical to take enough, or you will not see any effect.  Some women can see an effect by taking 2 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 6 pills a day).  Personally, I had to increase my dosage to 3 610mg pills three times a day (for a total of 9 pills a day) to get the desired effect.  Also, you have to be very consistent and really work hard not to skip any doses.  After a couple days of starting supplementation, I saw an increase in my supply, so I am now able to pump enough milk for my baby's bottles during the day while I am at work.  Thanks to the fenugreek, I'm getting a 2-3 ounce boost per day, which is not a huge amount, but it's all I needed.  Good luck!

review/text: I have not had any acid reflux since I started taking Fenugreek. Herbal is the way to go if at all possible.I have tried tums and prilosec they just make me feel nausia or my mouth tastes like chalk. With fenugreek you just take two pills befor each meal and no problems. Everything works diferently on different people but this is fairly cheep so you're not out much if it dosn't work for you.

review/text: I am a mother who had been successfully exclusively breastfeeding for over three months.  I noticed my supply was getting less and less and was told by a couple  of people said to try this herb.<br /><br />As I said in the title, I really would love to say it worked for me, but after taking this product, as directed, in hopes of boosting my milk supply, it failed to deliver.  I am not saying it may not work for others,  but all it did for me was make me smell like maple syrup, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Maybe it will work for you as it has for others.

review/summary: reasonable rate, definately helps with milk production
review/text: This is proven to be effective in increasing milk production when lectating in clinical studies. You do need to take higher dose which is 2 tabs three times a day. Retail chain in my city, the price was higher and pill count was lower, so definately a good deal to buy from amazon. I would highly recommend this for lactating mothers.<br />Also, diabetics can benefit from it too.

review/summary: Great way to increase milk supply without side effects
review/text: I used this with both of my children when I went back to work and needed to pump enough milk.  I couldn't stand the taste of the mother's milk teas, so this was SO helpful to me!  It worked within 2-3 days.  I did need to take about 8-10 capsules per day, and I did smell like maple syrup (fenugreek smells like maple and with such a high dose it does come out in your sweat), but it was worth it.  Neither of my children seemed to notice/mind, so I don't think it changed the taste of the milk at all.  I highly recommend this for any nursing mothers trying to increase their production!

review/text: I read all the reviews of this product and couldn't wait to use it. I took it for over a week when my baby started to get extremely fussy. The doctor determined she had colic, changed my diet, added special formula - still was not producing enough breast milk, and took me off all vitamins. After a week, she was becoming our happy baby again. I started taking this product again and within three days she started screaming again. I immediately stopped taking this and within a few days she was back to normal. For some reason this product bothered her stomach. I did not read anything about this in any of the reviews and want to let people know this could happen to them as well.

review/summary: Not a miracle cure, but definitely works
review/text: I ordered the supplement after realizing that pumping at work wasn't producing as much as I needed to cover what my 3-month old daughter drank at daycare, and I'm committed to exclusively breastfeeding for as long as the AAP recommends.  Currently I take two capsules with every meal (6 a day).  I began to notice increased engorgement probably about 48 hours after starting the supplement.  Since starting it, I've been pumping about 3-4 ounces more per day, which is enough to cover the gap I had been concerned about.  Although I myself was a bit gassy for the first few days, I didn't notice any side effects in my daughter (and I was definitely watching out for them).<br /><br />I should say, I had to stop taking the pills for a few days due to some minor surgery, and I did notice my supply go down again.  So the pills do work, but in my case at least I have to keep taking them to keep getting results.  I'm happy to do it for my baby :)

review/text: I was breastfeeding my twins and wanted a little help with milk production. I used it for about 2 days and saw a significant increase. I didn't notice any side effects, but I didn't take really high doses either ( I didn't need too). I was able to produce enough for the twins up to 5 months without needing any supplements, so it is not a situtation where I went from little production to a lot. I was producing a lot of milk to begin with and the fenugreek helped increase it enough that I didn't have to supplement with formula untill 8 months.

review/summary: Worked wonders for me!
review/text: I can honestly say that I noticed a significant difference in my milk production with 2 days of taking these pills. Almost everything I read from online resource sites kept saying to trust my baby and my body. Your body will produce what baby needs based on supply and demand. This wasn't working out so great for me. I breastfed full time from the day he was born and through his first month to establish my supply as the resources also stated. As well as pumped on occasion. Even then, however, my baby would fuss at nearly every feeding, especially when I had to feed on my right breast. How could I be expected to relax and just let the milk *slowly* come (drop by drop by drop) while my son is all but crying from hunger with my nipple in his mouth? It broke my heart! These pills turned out to be a life saver! Now he's 7 weeks old and I can pump 4.5 to 7oz per session and still feed him within 2hrs of pumping with no problems. As for that maple smell, I haven't experienced anything to that affect and most importantly - my baby is happy.

review/summary: Gave me an awesome boost to my breastmilk supply!
review/text: I went to a breastfeeding class at the hospital where I delivered my son about 6 wks before his arrival in 2010.  Five years before I had nursed my twins, but had given up at 10 wks due to not making enough milk & being totally exhausted from trying to keep up with both of them.  I wanted to be more successful this round.  The lactation nurse covered a bunch of details in the class but she specifically talked about some of the things moms could do to increase or maintain their natural milk supply.  She recommended fenugreek as one of the supplements that could be used that worked for a many people & had essentially no side-effects (the only thing mentioned was that mom's & baby's urine might smell like maple syrup which doesn't seem like a deterant to me!). I started using fenugreek less than 12 hrs after the birth of our son & I used it until he was 12 months old because that is when I weaned him.  I typically took two capsules at bedtime but if there were times I felt like my production was down, I would take it more frequently throughout the day. I have recommended this product for several friends & family members who have decided to breastfeed & will continue to. I'm so thankful that the lactation nurse knew about this product!

review/summary: It probably works but not for everybody
review/text: I got all exited seeing more reviews that it works.  My daughter is 3 half month and suddenly I start having less milk.  So I ordered fenugreek and blessed thistle in capsules.  I was taking 3 fenugreek and 2 blessed thistle with meals for a week and I didn't see really any change. One lady suggested me something else that helped her.  Walnuts!!!  I know from back in the days mom said that that's what doctors used to tell nursing moms.  To eat walnuts for more and fatty milk.  So I got a biggest bag they had in Walmart and ate it, I at probably good 6 oz of nuts at the end of the day I had more milk then my daughter needed and that night.  I am on my second day and so far I had enough milk and some extra.  I eat about 2 hand fools of walnuts a day.  My husband said it takes time for herbs to get into my system and seeing that its helping more moms, I will finish up the bottles and see if it will give me more milk.  I will get back on how it worked.  So moms try walnuts no other nuts but walnuts and see if that would help you, if fenugreek and blessed thistle didn't work for you. Gods Blessing!

review/summary: Smelled like syrup but no more milk
review/text: After reading reviews on this product I was really excited to get it and start taking it, I imagined all the milk I would start producing and how my baby would be guzzling it for months to come.  Unfortunately for me, the only thing that came true from the reviews I read was that I started to smell like maple syrup almost instantly. But I stuck with it, started taking 8 pills a day as opposed to 6 and after 2 weeks still no increase in my milk production. While I'm sure it works for some, if you're just not makig a whole lot of milk to start with, I don't think taking this will increase your supply much if at all. But if you think you'd like to smell like maple syrup then this is the product for you!

review/text: I had not had a problem making enough milk for my little guy but a few weeks after I went back to work, I noticed I was having trouble pumping enough milk for him for the next day, not to mention to store in case of an emergency.<br />I was told to take 2 of these pills 3 times day.  First day I took it, I only took 2 pills because I wanted to see if a smaller daily intake would suffice.  Well, I'm glad I only took one dose because the next morning I woke up engorged.  Had I taken more I think my boobs would have blown up. I take 2 pills once a day and every morning my bra is soaked with milk.<br />Now I'm not so nervous about making enough milk for him and now maybe I don't have to lug that heavy pump back and forth from and to work.  Hopefully I'll be able to make enough in two pumps and I can leave it at work.<br />A couple of reasons for the 4 stars and not 5.  I do smell a hint of that curry smell, not great, but not overwhelming and also, my baby has been having issues with gas and has kept me up for a couple of nights.  I'm not sure though if Fenugreek has anything to do with it.  I'll update when I figure it out.

review/summary: Not a Good Brand for Milk Supply
review/text: This brand did not help me with my milk supply.  I bought it because it was a little cheaper than the other brand on this site, and found this to be inferior.  The capsules smell like medicine, not maple syrup, and after 2 weeks of taking 3 pills, 3 x a day, I never got the maple syrup sweat like I did with the other brand.  I will be switching back and paying a little more for the quality.

review/summary: Hit 2 birds with one stone
review/text: When my daughter was only a week old my milk supply went downhill fast. I also had lopsided breasts bc I avoided my right breast every once in awhile bc the nipple hurt. After talking to my doctor, she told me it was safe to try FENUGREEK (3 pills 3 times a day), BLESSED THISLTE (aka MILK THISTLE 1 pill 3 times a day) and MOTHERS MILK TEA (3-5 cups a day --- which I couldnt drink bc it was gross). About a week later my right breast caught up and I was pumping 3 oz per breast as to the 1 oz I was getting (my right breast was only droplets before). I am confident that my daughter is now getting full with each feeding. Only bad thing is the FENUGREEK gives my skin a weird smell but it is worth it!!!

My cravings get terrible to where I get irratible and can't get sweets out of my head! With this stuff I was able to lose a bit of weight from a decreased appetite! You will be surprised how often cravings trick you into thinking you want food. Anyway also in conjunction with other herbs I've noticed more curves and a bigger butt. Boobs are semi larger but I'm losing hope with those. I will honestly take fenugreek for the rest of my life! Take that chocolate bar!

I exclusively breastfed my baby for 6 months and I was producing at least 5 4oz-bottle a day and after 6 months, I don't know what happened but I produce less and less so I tried this product. Used this product for 2 weeks and drank a lot of liquids but still I have not produced as much as I was expecting I will produce. I only produced 2 bottles a day. So, now I stopped using it. I don't know if I did not use it right or it is not really effective.

review/text: Fenugreek seed helps with digestion if you are not a new mother and breastfeeding.  From what I observed, my digestion became more evenly spaced over time, and I was hungry for food later than without taking the fenugreek.  I did not take the supplement regularly, however, and gave it to my sister who breastfeeds.  I can report her good news that the product works wonders for mothers and babies.  If you are a new mother and want an abundance of milk at your baby's feedings, I recommend this product and brand to you.

review/summary: Works in combination with Blessed Thistle!
review/text: I wanted to write a review since I didn't see many from moms who took Fenugreek while nursing an older baby, as opposed to a newborn. After we sleep trained my daughter and she began sleeping through the night at 8 months, my milk supply started to drop way more than I wanted it to. This may have also been because I was taking a b-vitamin supplement which included B6, which women take to suppress lactation !! (I know, I was kicking myself once I found this out!). I started taking 3 capsules of Fenugreek and 2 capsules of Blessed Thistle 3x a day (at meals), and increased my daytime feedings. To my relief, within 2 days my milk supply definitely increased. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: It's hard to say if this works, but I'm going to keep using
review/text: Before returning to work from maternity leave at 7 weeks, I'd already started exclusively pumping. Getting about 8oz per session. (Reading all the documentation about it, I was probably overproducing) The first week back at work was fine, no decrease. Second week, each day I was getting 1-2oz less a session. Third week, it dipped down even lower -losing 3-4oz/session. (So total, each session I was getting 2.5-3 oz- baby needs 4!) I started using FenuGreek, and maybe noticed an increase of about .5-1oz per session (taking 2 pills 3x a day). 4th week, I took 3 pills 3x a day...and this gave me an extra 1oz/session. I was producing just enough (barely) to keep up with baby and NOT enough to freeze any.<br /><br />I increased pumping sessions, to every 3 hours like clockwork- even throughout the night. This seemed to help. Luckily baby sleeps 6-7 hours now at night, so I could pump an extra bottle out during that time to make up for what I was lacking throughout the day.<br /><br />Side note: what helped me the MOST I feel - is stopping birth control. The dr. put me on BC at week 7, just as I stared back to work. When your supply is low, you'll try ANYTHING and EVERYTHING to get it back, so it's hard to say how much the FenuGreek helped. After 2 months of BC and FenuGreek I was keeping up, but just barely. On mo. 3, I stopped BC (still using FenuGreek) and with the added pumping sessions I now make enough for baby, and can freeze one 4oz bottle a day, and always have  3-4 bottles in the fridge at any given time - a must for daycare and the working mom! I'd rather use backup contraception than not breastfeed at all!

review/summary: Did the trick for me
review/text: I started taking these 3 pills 3 times a day with plenty of water and pumping and was able to stash at least 10oz or more in the freezer everyday.  I'm a working mom so I pump before I leave for work and then 3-4 times during my 9hr work day and feed on demand when I'm home with my daughter.  I was also drinking milkmaid tea twice a day.  I'm sure if it was the combination of the two but I was very happy with the results.  My freezer is overflowing with milk and I have plenty in the fridge for daycare everyday.  I never had a problem with any of the side effects other complained of but I did have a break in use for about two weeks or so.  I was still able to produce enough with out it but I liked the idea of stashing plenty for rainy days.  I'm not a fan of the maple syrup smell in my sweat & urine though.

review/summary: for my sister
review/text: I purchased this for my sister while sitting in the NICU with her and her newborn twins. She had been pumping trying to get her milk to come in so it could be provided for her 32 weekers:) She was very nervous as she had poor supply with her first child and now to try it with two, it seemed a challenge to say the least.<br />I searched nearby stores to try and find this supplement as it came recommended from several sources. I was unable to find it in our immediate area and so I went to "old faithful" amazon and found it here. I was pleased to locate it, but it didn't take a few days longer than I would have liked, although ordering them on my account and being able to have them shipped directly to her was convenient as we  live in different states.<br />I thought the price was a dollar or two higher than what I desired to pay, compared to other supplements for health. Nursing women is a positive thing for baby and mom and so making these supplements a bit more affordable may be something to consider.<br />All in all, I would recomend this product and seller, but I would still search for it at a slightly lower cost, if tie was not an issue.

review/text: I have to say that I was skeptical at first to try, but the pediatrician gave me the go ahead to take it.  My baby was highly allergic to baby formula plus she was a tiny baby.  I had to find something to increase my milk supply to help increase her birth weigh quickly.  I read every amazon review and I want to write one to also help another mom.  You may or the baby may get gassy but no pains...every baby is different.  This Fenugreek capsules works! It definitely increases your milk supply. If you are an organic fanatic, they sell it too but both capsules look identical.  Good luck to all the nursing moms.

review/summary: Has made a difference for me.
review/text: I have had a low breastmilk supply from the very beginning and have tried just about everything to increase it.  At the recommendation of a lactation consultant I started taking 4 capsules 3 times a day.  Within 48 hours I saw an ounce increase with each pump (which was huge for me).  It has continued to improve and I have been taking fenugreek for about 5 weeks.<br /><br />The downsides:  when I first started taking it it made my stomach a bit upset, but after about a week it was fine and everything was back to normal.  You will start to smell like maple syrup, I can think of worse things to smell like!<br /><br />Overall I really feel like this is helping my supply.  I will continue to take it until I am no longer breastfeeding.

review/text: I bougth this to use while nursing my newborn.  I started taking it when she was 2 days old.  Nursing has been great, she gets plenty of milk & I have no concerns about running out of milk.  This is my 3rd time nursing and this time has been the easiest, i dont know for sure if it's because of the fenugreek, but all i can say is that my baby is super happy.  so i would reccommend it if you are concerend about running low on milk.  Also, i read that this herb also is a great breast health support in general, and can help prevent breast cancer, which runs in my family.  So i will definatly continue taking it even after i'm done nursing!  Plus, i gave 5 stars b/c amazon has the best price for this.  I checked 3 other popular health stores and the best price is online!!

review/text: Fenugreek worked for me. After my milk supply started to diminish after going back to work I tried Fenugreek. I had to take quite a bit of it though for my milk to sustain my boy's hardy appetite. I never had an over-abundance of milk but I was at least able to get what he needed. The only side effect I had was my sweat smelled of maple syrup. My son also smelled like it. When I went outside I actually attracted bees! It became quite the joke between my friends and myself. It was worth it though to be able to continue feeding him on my own.<br />My poor second son was allergic to my milk so I wasn't able to see if it worked. I'll be trying it again with my 3rd son (due in a couple months) if I can't keep up with him. Bees or no Bees!

review/summary: Part of my regimen!
review/text: I have had milk supply issues since the day my baby was born, in part due to PCOS and hypothyroidism.  After both my lactation consultant and my baby's pediatrician recommended fenugreek, I finally tried it.  I have worked my way up to 4 capsules, 4 times a day, plus blessed thistle, goat's rue, alfalfa and domperidone.  Only after several weeks of this combination have I finally been able to stop supplementing with formula!!  I don't know which products are doing the trick, or if they truly are each contributing, but I wouldn't stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply.  For the record, though, I started fenugreek first and noticed an increase, though it wasn't until I had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient.  I highly recommend fenugreek, and after trying several brands, I feel Nature's Way is superior to some others out there.

review/text: Now I have to give this product a 3, because yes it works, but there were some complications. I did not notice a difference right away like some mothers. It was about 3 days after taking 3 capsules 3x a day that i had an increase in my supply. I was able to pump about 2 oz after each feeding prior  to taking the fenugreek, then it increased to about 6 oz after each feeding (i was storing for returning to work) About the time I started getting a result, my son was getting the side effects of horrible tummy pains. It made him constipated to where he didn't have a bm for 7 days, and he stayed up for almost 20 hrs straight screaming at one point. (he was about 2 months old and a very happy baby normally.) For this reason I had to discontinue use. I would recomend it for mothers who are having issues with their milk supply, because this is not the case for all babies, and the product works, but i would recomend discontinuing use at the first sign of a gassy fussy baby because it takes several days to get baby comfortable again once it starts- I got NO sleep for 4 days in a row.... yuck.

It wasnt until almost more than half of the bottle done I decided to do more research and found out that this was the reason why all of a sudden I was noticeably gaining weight :(.  I will stop taking it starting TODAY!  but will con't pumping while at work and nursing even if I have to wake up in the middle of the night to keep my flow going.  I hope to stick with Blessed Thistle and Mothers Milk Tea Bags hopefully there are no more unwanted surprises.

I head strong headaches, I was weak and I had problem with breathing. My baby had a cough and was spitting up milk. She could not swallow, the mucus in her mouth was very thick. I learned from my doctor that fenugreek has very dangerous side effects: it can cause asthma;  reduces blood glucose levels which means it is not right for diabetics; promotes menstrual flow and can make yor menstrual cycles abnormal. I spent money on pills, teas, drops and my milk supply did not increase at all. I can breastfeed my baby only once a day now. I am happy with what I can give her although I see clearly that she hates formula. I give only one star because the manufacturer does not warn about side effects the product can have on mother and her child. I bet they know the pills are used mostly for the purpose of increasing breastmilk supply, yet they do not care about us.

review/summary: Great for runny noses!
review/text: Fenugreek has many different purposes and uses. The one that we take it for is either Runny noses or stuffed up noses when we start to get colds. This really works great. We will normally take Astragalus along with Fenugreek when we start to notice we are either stuffed up or have a runny nose. The two seem to work great together. The way that we use it isn't an every day vitamin, it's more of a 'when you are sick' vitamin. Depending on how bad it is, we will either take it once a day, or once in the morning and once in the evening.<br /><br />Hope this helped you out!

review/summary: Milk is flowing
review/text: I bought these for my wife whose had a tough time with breastfeeding. She had a C-section so it was about 4-5 hours before the hospital let our daughter nurse for the first time. Unfortunately my wife went home without getting things figured out and things got even tougher. The lactation nurse helped on an outpatient basis and strongly suggested Fenugreek. I purchased this right away and it was taken with each meal. Finally my daughter had that well-fed-can-barely-keep-my-eyes-open look on her face after nursing. Fenugreek taken 3 times a day has been the best advice we've received so far for breastfeeding. Even if your infant isn't crying, feed him/her at least every three hours maybe more if you can do it. Also, my daughter was an excellent sleeper and her pediatrician said to wake her up and encourage her to nurse. These suggestions along with the Fenugreek increased my wife's milk supply and made for a happy, healthy and chubby baby.

review/text: I take this now to increase milk supply, and I think it is working... I pump 5 oz each breast a time, every three hours at work. I am not sure exactly how much my 3 months old drinks when I nurse him directly but he seems to be happy with flowing milk!  This product is one of many things I try to increase the milk supply so I don't know if only this herb helped it, but I believe it did by seeing much difference in pump mount.. Anyway, I'll keep taking it since it is easy to take in capsules.

review/text: I just bought this product at the supermarket, where I paid a pretty penny for it. When comparing it to a box of any kind of cereal, the number of servings per box has to be considered, along with things like protein content. Because I have paid a dollar each for certain cereal snack/sports bars, I was willing to give this a try, and I am glad I did. With half a handful of craisins, a touch of honey, it was bliss, vs. "neigh, Mr. Ed! How are your plain Oats this morning?"

review/summary: perhaps it was old or a bad batch, but not good at all...
review/text: I opened the first of four bags and it did *not* smell at all like chocolate or even like coffee.  It had a slightly odd odor, not good in fact, kind of like old leaves, but I thought that, just perhaps, a pot brewed from this might be okay.  It was if anything worse, it tasted simply awful, like it was spoiled somehow.  Now there's no expiration or production date on the packages that I could find, only a copyright date of 2009.  I don't know whether this is the way it normally tastes (I can't really imagine that), or if it was a bad batch, or had simply spoiled somehow, but I think it was likely one of the two latter options.  I am not keen, however, on paying money to try this again.  Amazon was kind enough to refund my purchase price.<br /><br />I'm a regular coffee drinker (4+ cups/day) and have brewed two pots a day for going on 25 years for the family.  I'm a big fan of chocolate coffees and other flavored coffees, and I've not experienced any coffee remotely like what was in this package.

Ignore the 'Kebbler' title.  The Shortbread is made with Splenda and has a pleasant vanilla-like aftertaste.  Eight little cookies come in a packet.  Each is 1-1/2" in diameter.  The packet is 130 calories and has 140 mg of sodium. The packet says it's equivalent to one diabetic exchange each of fat and carbohydrate.  I feel that one packet is just the right size for a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack.  Highly recommend.

Taken by the novelty (and wondering what the "Simply" part was about), I bought a tin...and regretted buying w fistful more of those tins. Strong enough to take the edge off a fairly-pungent meal, yet just mild enough to be truly enjoyable on their own (borderline addictive, I'd say), Simply Mint is not merely my favorite Altoids mints, but my favorite mints, period. As the previous reviewer mentioned, it's awfully good to be able to get them via Amazon, since the things are pretty thin on the ground in NYC.

review/text: These noodles are great, for soft you just boil them in chicken stock  like it says on the package, takes about 5 minutes, put noodles in a bowl with just a little stock then add green onions bacon pieces and hard boiled eggs sliced up with a little soy sauce and it is wonderful! People just don't know about these noodles, my dad was in veitnam and when he came home he did all the cooking and i have been eating them for 35 years. THE BEST THING ABOUT THESE NOODLES IS YOU CAN FRY THEM UP IN A WOK OR PAN WITH REGULAR OIL AND THEY ARE THE BOMB! THEY ARE SO GOOD! WHEN YOU GET DONE BOILING THEM JUST DRAIN AND RINSE REALLY WELL WITH COLD WATER TO GET THE STARCH OUT AND LET THEM DRY OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEM FRY THEM UP AND DRAIN ON A PAPER TOWEL.

My family loves potato salad and mashed potatoes, so I thought I would give them a shot. Took me twice as long as it would have if I had just peeled the potatoes as I usually do. You have to cook the potatoes BEFORE you peel them - but only halfway- and if they are not cooked anough, the peel doesn't come off as easy as they say. Then you put them back in the water to finish boiling. The "bumps" on the gloves that give  them the rough texture also started to come off with the second potato.<br /><br />Don't waste your money - just keep a very sharp knife handy.

Sometimes a salsa will be too thin or have some overbearing taste to it (like cilantro),or just be so hot that all you taste is the heat. This is not too thick, not too thin and has a nice flavor along with the very hot habanero flavor. I can use this for dipping, cooking seasoning, or for tacos.

review/summary: Sea salt is delicious
review/text: This McCormick sea salt is delicious, so much better than regular table salt.  It has a coarse texture and fine flavor.  To help grind up the crystals, the salt bottle comes with its own grinder up top.  Just turn it over and twist.  The only downside is sometimes guests don't know how to do that.

review/summary: Tracked it down
review/text: My fav local coffee shop was using this product; now they've lost a customer because I can have it at home!  Great frappe for those who like blended drinks but don't want anything either too bitter or too sweet, however you can always adjust the flavor level and experiment with the amount of ice to produce your perfect choice.  If you use soy milk, be warned it does alter the flavor substantially.

review/summary: Awesome Snack
review/text: Great snack, if you're thinking of buying these go ahead and do it. You can thank me later. It is a sweet bread stick covered in chocolate. The thing is, it tastes like a dark chocolate rather than a milk chocolate, so the flavor is intense and quite awesome at that. I bought ten boxes, and I only have a few left, that's how good these are.

review/summary: yummy  Snacks from Japan
review/text: fell in love with these when I lived in ?Korea they had thier own version but I found the Pocky brand on a wekend trip to Japan, they  were  far superior to the local brand in Korea. They even have them at my local Safeway here in Nevada, but cheaper to buy in 10 packs thru Amazon. These are a fun and awesome snack,I can reccomend them.

review/summary: order it in the winter
review/text: quality of the product was sufficient given that it's packaged pretzels and chocolate (if you don't know what you're getting into, it's pretty much that: chocolate on the outside of a long pretzel stick), BUT. order it in the summer and expect to receive some very well heated chocolate. I open mine up (after letting it cool) to find a monstrosity of fused chocolate and snapped pretzel. I will be trying to order these again when the weather permits the transit of something with such a low melting point, and may update my review at that point.

review/summary: Pocky = Best. Thing. Ever.
review/text: ...if Pocky isn't the very best thing ever, then it should certainly be way way up on the list.<br />I can never have enough of these.  Pocky is a perfect balance of biscuit (sort of a pretzel stick, though I'm usually not fond of pretzel crackers) and chocolate. It's very good chocolate, and is excellent with the biscuit. I don't know anyone who doesn't like/love these.

review/summary: Absolutely Delicious!
review/text: Gocce di Sole is a sugar coated jelly candy that comes in five citrus flavors (orange, lemon, lime, pink grapefruit and mandarin orange).  The candy is soft and fresh with a true fruit flavor. The jellies are coated in crystals of sugar that tastes like sugar and not gummy glop.  This product bears no resemblance to dried out supermarket candy that is stale and difficult to chew.  This candy tastes like actual fruit and arrives soft and fresh.  Three pieces (35 grams) have 0 grams of fat and only 100 calories.  So it's about as guilt free as a treat can be.

review/summary: Absolutely the Best
review/text: If you're used to those best-selling boxed raisins that feature a health woman happily working in the fields, get real, and then get Newman's Organic Raisins.<br /><br />These may be the best-tasting grocery raisins you've ever had. Nothing even approaches these for their flavor, texture, and all those Newman Company extras that aficionados like me adore. (We're talking organic ingredients, environmentally sound production, profits donated to the needy, and supporting the goals of one of the most compelling actors of all time, and a heck of a nice guy as well.)<br /><br />But back to the food at hand.<br /><br />These are plump, JUICY raisins, startlingly different from the usual fare. I don't know how they do it, but Newman's Organic California Raisns retain their natural flavor; pleasant scent, and a succulent mouth feel that one expects from fine port.  One "secret" may be the ingredients: Raisins. C'est tout. Make that ingredient, in fact. THe only thing missing is Newman's usual story on the package--usually some wild, adventurous story shedding light on the product, and featuring Mr. Newman as raconteur-narrator.  Perhaps with raisins this classically delicious, we must resort to the Latin --"Res Ipsa Loquitor" -- the thing speaks for itself. Unbelievable.<br /><br />Nutritional Information for 1/4 cup (40 grams).<br /><br />Calories 130 (calories from fat 0), Total Fat 0g (saturated fat 0 g, trans fat 0g), Cholesterol 0mg, Sodium 10mg, Potassium 310mg, Total Carbohydrates 31g (dietary fiber 21g, sugars 29g), Protein 1g.<br /><br />Further Information (taken from the Newman's Organics website).<br /><br />COMPANY<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics was established as a division of Newman's Own in 1993, and became a separate company in late 2001.

review/summary: The very best organic raisins!
review/text: I love organic raisins and eat them every day. I have tried many different brands of them and I honestly think that these are the very best of them all! I love the container and the ease of opening and closing it, also. The raisins are always fresh and delicious. They are never dried out, like other brands sometimes are. I am addicted to these.

review/text: These taste good and are a good substitute for your standard box of raisins to avoid all the toxins of commercial farming.<br />I have had better though. Larger plumper raisins from the healthfood store.<br /><br />Get them for your health, not for anything unique

When I divide the cost out on what I was buying before<br />i.e. store brand organics....there is no comparision...<br />Newmans Own is far Superior in cost,taste,and I can recyle the packaging<br />in my recycle program on the curb.

review/text: We originally bought these because of a promotion, but because they are the best raisins out there, we recently took our sixth shipment from Amazon. The 6 pack of canisters is good for a family of four for about 3-4 months. The 15% discount for subscribe and save helps out, and you can cancel if you don't want to receive anymore without penalty.

review/summary: A league of thier own
review/text: The price is not great but it's fair. It's Paul Newman so that's a plus. They're "organic" but I'm still not sure why that's important. I like raisins. I eat them by the handful or in cereal or cookies. Even with oatmeal sometimes. These almost seem like a different fruit than the other raisins that i have had.  they are softer, and a much richer flavor.  After all - a raisin is a dried grape. These are good raisins and they taste much better than grocery store raisins. Actually, I was a little shocked at how good they were. I'd read many of the reviews here and expected something wonderful like little bursts of sunshine with each bite. What I got was a great raisin.
