review/summary: Spoiled Rotten.
review/text: After feeding my children for two consecutive days with this formula, I decided to try it because they weren't eating like they normally do. The formula tasted rotten and spoiled. Never buying again. No wonder they've been fussy. I've tried the same formula, different batch and the difference is night and day. If ordering on Amazon, I'd order powder and not this crap. - Unhappy Dad.

review/summary: if your baby is really fussy and gassy, this is not the formula you want - try Alimentum instead!
review/text: First, these cans are a pain, really inconvenient. You have to open with a can opener and there is no easy way to pour it out of the can.  Unless you have a ton of clean bottles and can make them all up at once then you have to figure out something to put the remainder in to store it because storing in the can is really not an option - how do you seal it up?<br /><br />Second, our baby refused to eat it after a  few sips. He ate the previous formula like a starved bear, though.  I gave it a few tries to make sure he was just not hungry the first time and nope, he hated this stuff even when I mixed it with his other formula. I tasted it and I can see why he refused to eat it. It was just about the worst thing I've ever tasted! It also made him fussy and gassy. We tried Similac Alimentum instead and that did the trick. If your baby is fussy and gassy and/or has reflux, I don't recommend this formula.<br /><br />Third, 3 of the 6 cans I purchased were badly dented. We won't be buying formula from Amazon again.

review/summary: This food is ideal for ailing and special needs kitties!
review/text: I have a cat with feline lymphoma that we have needed to switch from dry food to a high quality protein diet. We tried many different (and often expensive) brands before coming across this one. The proteins are ideal for her requirements and the ingredients (according to the label) appear to be of high quality. Our cat is prone to many allergies and has never before eaten wet food but with a 3 day introduction of gradually mixing it in to her dry food she has completely accepted the wet food and solely eats it.<br /><br />Also we are proud to say that within 3 weeks of changing her diet and administering cod liver oil 3 days out of each week our kitty's adrenal tumors are 70% reduced in size and she is well on her way to becoming healthy again.

review/summary: Taste of the Wild for Cats
review/text: We recently added a new little Ragdoll boy to our household approx 3 months ago and the breeder suggested we feed him Taste of the Wild wet and dry food.  I had another cat who was approx 4 1/2 years and was concerned about having to buy all these different kinds of food for them but when the kitten arrived I noticed that my older cat was very interested in the kittens' food.  So I slowly switched her over as Taste of the Wild is slated for all ages and she has been doing great!  She had been eating Eukanuba before and seemed to be okay with it but since she has changed it seems her fur feels better and the big thing is she does not cough up hair balls anywhere near the amount she did before. She is long-haired so we kind of just got used to the idea that she was frequently going to cough up hair balls but she has literally only done it twice since she started this food. I noticed my older cats breath is not as bad as before. Both the cat and kitten are doing great on this food and it's not much more than the average brand which made me even happier!..Even less when I order it from Amazon!  Your kitties with love it!

review/summary: Great For Sending to Armed Forces Overseas!!
review/text: Hi All,<br /><br />I am a volunteer for a local organization, here in San Diego County, that sends packages of personal care items and condiments to our brave men and women in Afghanistan. We do it about every two months. One of the largest requests we get from our troops is for peanut butter! These small packs make it easy to send them the peanut butter they crave, while in that beastly, hot desert serving their country and defending freedom. With the holiday season upon us, what better gift can we give them, than peanut butter!!<br /><br />Regardless of where your political allegiance lies on this "war", these are our children over there. Their lives are at risk each and every day. They deserve every convenience that we can afford to give them!<br /><br />If there is no such organization such as ours [OPERATION: AMERICA CARES] in your area, PLEASE start one.<br /><br />Thank you! God Bless the U.S.A. and our soldiers and troops in Afghanistan!!<br /><br />Alain

review/text: Affordable packets?  Yes.  Good tasting? No.  In fact, even though the dates show an expiration of September 2011, they taste sort of rancid.  Was second guessing myself when I saw how many you received versus Skippy, etc.  Should have stuck with my original intuition.  That old adage about "you get what you pay for" pretty much rings true here.  First and last purchase of the Carriage House brand...bleccch.

review/text: OK, I'm from Buffalo so if you're going to sell a Buffalo Wing Pretzel, it better be good.<br /><br />Let me be honest, this is no substitute for an Anchor Bar wing, but as for a Buffalo Wing Pretzel, it's not bad. The pretzel pieces are mostly smallish, crunchy bites. A few larger pieces sneak in once in a while but mostly these are smallish nuggets with a pretty tasty and spicy, Buffalo Wing-ish taste.<br /><br />They're kind of addicting if you like the taste, and I do.

review/summary: Teisseire Framboise Raspberry Syrup
review/text: I was very disappointed with this product.  It is mostly sugar syrup with some raspberry flavoring (15%).  The raspberry taste is very weak, being overwhelmed by the lemon and other berry flavor.  Another brand that I ended up purchasing as a replacement was far better, but I admit it cost a lot more. I wish the ingredients had been viewable before receiving it (at least I couldn't find a link to see what the ingredients were). Perhaps the bottle that I got was too old, though the date on it says 02/2011.

review/summary: Excellent when you add a few extra touches~
review/text: This mix is really delicious with a great texture and isn't too sweet at all if you a couple tablespoons of cocoa powder and dark chocolate chips in addition to the ones already in there.  As long as you don't overcook them and use jumbo eggs (you need a higher egg amount so jumbo eggs work perfectly), they come out moist and light.  I really don't like sweet chocolate or milk chocolate so much (is also a dark chocolate girl as the other reviewer said as well) but with some extra cocoa powder these muffins are fantastic.  I haven't found them anywhere near as greasy or oily as many other mixes, but I haven't tried this mix without adding the extra cocoa powder~

review/text: Last year I gave this along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979125">Salt: Cooking with the World's Favorite Seasoning</a> to my foodie friends and family. They all loved it! The salt tubes were well packaged and I ordered 10 sets and had no broken tubes. The package also came with salt samples which I really appreciate. I have Collection Sets 1 and 2 on my counter and get lots of comments about them when people visit.

review/summary: First class company, wonderful offerings
review/text: I purchased the Old World collection directly from the Spice Lab as a Father's Day gift for my husband.  The item was extremely well packed and arrived ahead of schedule. A small wooden salt spoon, sample packets of gourmet salts and a reference/index card with information about each of the 11 salts were included. Brett was responsive and helpful. This is a great company with an interesting variety of salts and spices. I will definitely make a future purchase and refer the Spice Lab to others.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm disappointed that my email reguarding a broken test tube and cork has gone unanswered.  The first time I used one of the salts, I was extrememly gentle but a large piece broke off as well as some of the cork top. The tubes should not be so fragile so I sent an email to that affect to Brett, the owner. Despite answering my initial email about how much I loved the gift and where could I post a positive comment, he has not responded with regards to the breakage. Good customer service would be to follow up.....

review/text: What a wonderful starter kit this is.  While I am and was familiar with some varieties of exotic sea salts, I certainly had not had the opportunity to try this many at one time.  Tather than chance buying a product that I did not like and being stuck with it, this allowed me to give each and everyone a try.<br /><br />I plan to order at least three more sets for presents this coming year for friends that, like me, are foodies.<br /><br />This is an excellent product.

review/text: This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.  In other words, each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker.

review/summary: Review Correction
review/text: On Sept.12 I posted the following seller review:<br />  3/5 stars:<br />  "I'm sorry to say that this item arrived with some slight cosmetic damage. On the top front edge of the rack there is what I would call a dent, but it's also rough. From the way it was packaged I would have to say that it was that way when it was put into the box. I intended this as a gift, and I don't have time to return it, so I'll just try to sand it down so it's at least smooth."<br />  Jammies, September 12, 2012<br />Later Amazon added:<br />  Message from Amazon: "This item was fulfilled by Amazon, and we take responsibility for this fulfillment experience."<br /><br />Shortly after I posted it, I received an email from The Spice Lab Inc. offering to send a new block. I sent them a couple of pictures of the damaged area. They sent me a new block and two little spoons to replace the one that was missing from my original order. The replacement block arrived yesterday in plenty of time for my trip to visit my son and daughter-in-law.<br /><br />In hindsight, I should have contacted The Spice Lab before I posted the review, so they could have had time to resolve the problem. I had jumped to the conclusion that I'd need to return the item in order to get a replacement, which wasn't the case.<br /><br />Since it's a gift, I can't speak to the quality of the salt, but I can say that the block is very sturdy and attractive, and the little spoon is a charming addition.<br /><br />I greatly appreciate the efforts of Brett at The Spice Lab, and I would happily buy from them again.

review/text: I bought this as a gift for a friend who likes exotic salts, and it was a hit with him. It was well packaged with no breakage. (Some of the reviews have mentioned that they received broken containers.) The wooden holder is nice but not all that permanent. I would recommend this for someone who'd like to sample various kinds of salt and doesn't mind paying a high price. The reason I gave it four and not five stars was the price.

review/summary: INSTANT DECAF IN AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE 20-PACKET OFFERING
review/text: INSTANT DECAF FOR WHEN 20 PACKETS MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH or YOU WANT TO ADD MORE INSTANT FOR A STRONGER BREW!<br /><br />WHAT IT IS:<br /><br />This is fairly mild and smooth, although it tastes a bit watery like most DeCaf. Because this is DeCaf, you won't feel more alert after drinking it, but it will warm you up if you are outside or cold. The coffee will stay fresh for at least several months with refrigeration, making it ideal for when company turns up in large numbers and a bunch of them are likely to say they just HAVE to have Sanka - OR ELSE!<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />This is very reasonable to keep around the house, especially when you use it as a secondary beverage. If you drink this regularly, try either Sanka Ground Roast or Colombian Supreme DeCaf from Maxwell House. There are usually coupons for this product, and many supermarkets will double them. I find my coupons at the public library, usually from the Sunday paper.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY COMPANY OR PRODUCT]

review/summary: Hurry to buy
review/text: This is so-called "Kaki-P" which is a salt peanuts with spicy crackers. One of many Japan-original snacks which had been available only in Japan until recently. This one is not too salty and a good associate of sake, beer and green tea. kameda is famous for their quality products and received high reputation for neary a half century. Its price ($18 for 6 once) is not expensive for its quality.<br /><br />However,,,<br />Recently Kameda announced a business tie-up with a Korean company (some of the company's products are prohibited to import in some countries and very likely the US too for hygienic reason). Hurry to buy as much as possible you can buy before the current safe stocks last. God only knows if Kameda can keep high quality of this product after some month later on.

review/summary: Incredible quality, great flavor, 16g protein/14g fiber per 17oz box!
review/text: Some time back, I saw really foodgasmic reviews of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKU1TO">Pacific Natural Foods Organic Soup, Roasted Red Pepper and Tomato, 16-Ounce Cartons (Pack of 12)</a> and despite almost always making my own, it was on sale, so I got it (the 32 oz though, since they're the same thing, the 32oz "creamy" listed here not actually saying creamy anywhere, maybe a marketing change). On it was a coupon for $1 off this, so at my store, since I only live a few hours from where this stuff's made, well, that made this 17.6oz box a buck sixty. Seeing the ingredients and nutritional profile, I had to seriously hold back from using more coupons right then and there and buying them all.<br /><br />Does it say much to tell you I went back two days later, lots of coupons available, and got EVERY SINGLE ONE (granted it was only 7) and even went--because that location of the co-op didn't have another item I wanted--to the other location a couple days after THAT and got even more? Yeah, it's that good.<br /><br />The flavor is savory, aromatic, lovely. The base has a clear tomato flavor, the red peppers definitely shine through, and it also has a warm, "fully cooked" onion presence in the base. The main spices that are apparent are cumin, a touch of garlic, and a bit of chili powder. The celery is thankfully extremely mild (too many soups are heavy on the celery flavor, which is not my idea of yum). There's a touch of sweet corn in it that contrasts the otherwise savory-on-savory flavor blend really nicely. The most important part, though, are the beans! By volume--I'm not a bean counter :D--it's about 50% black beans and 50% lentils, which I thought was excellent. If you're looking for lentil soup that's the traditional style, ie 80% lentils, 20% accents like onions and such, this isn't it. This IS, though, awesome and pretty unique. It's good enough for me to buy, and again, soup's easy and I'm SO picky I can't stand most processed stuff!<br /><br />It can easily be spiced up--some Madras style curry and maybe a bit of creme fraiche or greek yogurt would be great. Since I also got, for a mere four bucks each, my beloved Dave's Killer Bread (Good Seed)--the only honest to god truly healthy and whole bread available--I of course experimented! All in the name of science and fair reviewing! The broth--thinner than you'd expect for "lentil soup" but exactly what you would for "vegetable soup"--is improved by this bread (can't speak for others of course), whereas the beans I preferred with just a touch of the broth, no bread. I could, however, see this being a pretty cool base for, say, salsa--maybe drained a bit with the broth saved--I wouldn't throw out anything from this, and I'm a food snob!<br /><br />The last thing I have to mention is the PACKAGING and prep. Did I mention it took a mere 90 seconds to cook in the microwave? It's AWESOME for commuting and even CAMPING and here's why: like other tetra pak boxes, it can handle quite a bit of tumbling around (wouldn't "test it" with puncturing, but I know for a fact they can get crushed on the corners and survive or be squeezed pretty tight and not leak/explode). What's DIFFERENT about these "tetra brik" ones is that to open, you simply pop the triangles on the side up, squeeze the upper 4 corners to make it shaped like a capri sun, and unzip the sturdy box. The zipper's quite easy (I was able to grip it with a thumb that had just been busted 12 hours prior) and even I--a red food magnet--didn't spill or splash it a bit! To dispose of it, just rinse and recycle (in cities that do Tetra, which mine does or else I'd probably not drink hazelnut milk as much as I do let alone eat soup--I DO wish plain ol' beans and canned tomatoes would be put in these though--Muir Glen, you listening?)... so to camp, just rinse if you can but otherwise, just fold it several times, shove it in your waste bag, and you have a VERY small container for the amazing nutrition in it. That said, while I consume the (actual, 100g) recommended amount of fiber to stay healthy, this is not the right choice if you have a formal event later in the evening or on the next day. To quote an old professor, when you pick what you're eating, "you've got two choices: fat or fart." This one doesn't make you fat, so ease into it if you eat a lot of sugar/refined carbs or drink juices, soda, beer, etc. regularly instead of naturally fiber rich options :P

review/text: I ordered this soup to have something on hand for those "oops forgot to pack lunch for work" days. It was tasty enough, but even though my husband and I eat a fair amount of vegetables anyway this was just too fiber-y for us. It also had a slightly off, almost liquid smoke-esque flavor to it. It was very good mixed with some mashed potatoes though.<br /><br />Overall, as a once in awhile thing it would probably be fine, but 12 was too many for us.

review/text: This product will give you the crispiest chicken, fries, onion rings and the most delicious country fried steak. The flakes are made of rice and have a much heavier texture than just plain breadcrumbs, so it sticks better to food and gets 10 times crispier. You use it the same way you'd use regular breadcrumbs.  Because it has so much more volume than regular breadcrumbs, you can also use it as a topping for casseroles.  It's also the perfect filler to add when preparing a meatloaf. It's the only breadcrumbs I use!!

review/summary: Make sure it's fresh. Tastes great but a fried product
review/text: We bought the Panko a few years ago but I didn't review it then. Panko is basically supercharged Japanese breadcrumbs. But they are used as a batter for deep or pan frying. They taste great but as used they are not good for you. As an oven coating they would be better. Ours wasn't dated sufficiently far in advance to keep before we used them up. We could taste the rancidity as time went by. Make sure they are fresh before you buy them in quantity. And if you care about cholesterol and weight gain don't use them for frying at all. Steaming or pan-frying without adding bread crumbs or Panko is the healthiest way to go.

review/summary: Mostly Maple
review/text: Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was expecting this to have a more complex flavor than coffee and maple syrup. While it certainly smells wonderful, the flavor is pretty much weak coffee with a touch of maple. That in itself would be pretty ho-hum, but the maple flavor has a weird synthetic aftertaste to it, which makes each K-Cup taste a bit like you've thrown some instant flavored coffee in to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DLB2FI">Keurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter</a>.<br /><br />If you're looking for maple-flavored coffee, skip this, and get Timothy's Sugarbush Maple instead. Timothy's coffee is a bit more robust, and the maple flavor is much more natural. It isn't always available on Amazon (which is why I can't link to it at the time of this review), but keep an eye out for it.

review/summary: Golden goodness!
review/text: I have tried many flavored or specialty K-Cups and the Golden French Toast is one of my favorites!  As with most of the flavored coffee K-Cups, it's more of a smell than taste for me (this explains why many people say the flavors are too "light" even though I enjoy this) but this one actually does taste like sweet maple syrup.  It's perfect in the mornings!

review/summary: My favorite!
review/text: I have to admit I'm addicted to this Green Mountain flavor of coffee! It's smooth, rich and not an overwhelming flavored coffee. It's what I would describe as a medium bodied coffee, not weak and definitely not got that bitter bite that strong coffees have. The aroma is wonderful and peaks your taste bud's interest even before the first sip! Be warned though, once you try it you may not want to drink any other coffee again.

review/summary: Light Roast Coffee w Breakfasty Aroma!
review/text: This is a very smooth light-bodied, light-roast coffee that pairs well with breakfast, mainly attributable to it's bouquet.  Although having a soothing, pleasant butterscotch-maple aroma with a hint of cinnamon, it's not a sweet coffee to the taste unless you add something sweet to it and has a subtle nutty-dark chocolate, lingering finish.  It's an inviting, cozy warm-up in a cold New England winter and a year-'round, anytime treat.  I give this a 4-star rating b/c I still typically prefer xtra-bold coffee (my absolute knockout xtra-bold is Emeril's Big Bold), however, this is a cheery, quality change of pace without the characteristic chemical artificiality of most types of 'flavored' coffees I've sampled. It's like having a "smiley face" in your cup!

review/summary: Missing French Toast Taste
review/text: I drink the flavored K-cup coffees, but did not like this one.  It smells nice when brewing, but doesn't taste like french toast.  It tastes more like regular coffee, but does not have a light, smooth taste, which I prefer in my coffee.  That could be because it has a touch of maple, but it just fails to deliver what I expected.

review/text: Green Mountain Coffee Golden French Toast smelled good once brewed but left a lot to be desired after tasting it.  I have the Keurig B60 and used the 8 oz cup size first.  I found at this setting it tasted watered down.  So for the next cup I used the smaller 6 oz setting and found it to be a little more flavorful.  This is a light roast coffee and I am used to a medium or dark.  I did not really get the maple taste but more of the cinnamon.  I would not buy this coffee again.  Delivery was prompt as usual with Amazon Prime.

review/text: I tried this in the holiday multipack (came with Spicy Eggnog, Gingerbread & Holiday Blend, too).  Despite the flavor mix, my kitchen smelled predominantly like the Golden French Toast.  I ran out of this flavor first and was saddened there wasn't more.  I was excited to see it sold own it's own and quickly blew through another box.  This is such a tasty flavor, and I love the smell of it brewing!!!  This is a must have flavor.

They know it's the one flavor that I will have for sure.<br /><br />Again...if you expect coffee to be strong enough to pick you up and carry you around the room, this coffee is not for you. You should try a coffee with a heavy ROAST...this one is Golden French TOAST...as in light and golden. :-)
