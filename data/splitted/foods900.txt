review/summary: The Coffee Cake recipe was amazing!
review/text: I am surprised by the other reviews. We found this at our local grocery store and we were pleasantly surprised by the price which was way cheaper than most gluten free foods. My two boys and I made the coffee cake recipe on the back of the box and we really liked it. It had great texture and was just like "normal" coffee cake. I am going to put this on my "subscribe and save" list and make the coffee cake a regular weekend treat.

review/summary: Hodgson Mill Gluten Free Multi Purpose Baking Mix
review/text: To say my wife is allergic to foods is an understatement. It would be easier to list the foods to which she does not have an allergic reaction. The Hodgson Mill Gluten Free Multi Purpose Baking Mix is one of them.<br />Note that the Product Features listed for this product on-line state that it is made with ... soy ...  But the box does not list soy as an ingredient. My wife is allergic to soy. I first saw this product at a store and the actual 4 ingredients listed on the box, my wife did not have any known allergic reactions. So I bought it for her to try. She loves it and has no problems with it. She also adds a little honey when mixing and helps to give a sweeter taste.<br />She makes a bunch of waffles with it at one time and keeps them in the refrigerator and takes one with her whenever she goes someplace to munch on when she needs a little snack.<br />Also note that the ingredients list under the Important Information heading on-line states the true contents. I also buy it with the Amazon Subscribe & Save option and get it cheaper.

review/summary: my favorite all-purpose
review/text: This is my favorite all purpose GF flour mix.  What this is great for are those times you just need a bit of flour for something where it's not the main feature, like apple crisp topping.  I like the mix because it's made with whole grain flours (healthy), no bean flours are included (yuck), and it's a reasonable price.  I have used it in a number of recipes with success. I wouldn't make loaf bread with it though.  Best used in combination with other flours/ingredients.  I never used bisquick or any other baking mixes before going gluten free so it doesn't bother me that it's not that type of mix.

review/summary: Still trying to scrape the flavor out of my mouth :-P
review/text: If this was the only gf mix available, I'd probably kill myself. I tried using it to make the brownies on the box a couple of weeks ago and they came out awful. Dry and with a definite dirt flavor. It was terrible!!! Anyway, I wasn't sure if I'd made some type of mistake so I just tried it again in a chocolate cake recipe. I'm literally sitting here sucking on candy and trying to get that god awful flavor out of my mouth. Totally money down the drain because the cake is sitting in the garbage. I bought this one because it didn't have sugar added to it and I prefer to use xylitol, but if sugar is not an issue then I'd definitely buy the betty crocker gf cake mix boxes or the one that comes in a brown paper bag. I can't remember the name but it's delicious unlike this atrocity.

review/summary: Excellent with the right recipes
review/text: I received this baking mix as a gift, and I tried it with a soft and chewy molasses cookie recipe.  I shared the cookies with a mixed group of friends: some that have to eat gluten-free some that do not.  They all loved the cookies and no one mentioned any bitter after taste that another reviewer mentioned.  I would recommend these for dark breads, cookies, and cakes, of the spice variety, such as banana bread, zucchini bread, molasses cookies, gingerbread cookies, carrot cake etc.  This works well for dark colored doughs and should work well to bake a gluten-free alternative to whole wheat bread.  I would NOT recommend this for light and fluffy buttermilk pancakes, white cakes, or other baked goods where a few simple flavoring ingredients like chocolate chips or peanut butter need to shine through.  For the right application, this is a whole grain, healthy, easy-to-use gluten-free alternative to traditional flour mixes.

review/text: I am not sure what others are tasting but this mix exceeded my expectations.  I am a very experienced baker and have missed  the taste of wheat for too long! So far I have made pancakes and muffins using this flour blend and it tastes like their whole wheat cousins.  White rice was never meant to be a flour and this mix proves it.  It contains whole grains that are used for flours all over the world and have a real taste and flavor, unlike white rice flour.  I am very pleased.

Now, granted, it's not wheat--but it's not bad. Even the husband liked them, and he's quite picky about GF cooking (we've been burned in the past). It's nicer than having to buy the individual flours and mix them yourselves, and the flavors blended nicely--and no gritty bean flours!

review/summary: Bad aftertaste
review/text: I have been gluten free for almost ten years, and this is probably # 5 in the top ten worst substitutes I have ever tried. It had a weird, bitter aftertaste that was very prevalent in the waffles, not as much in the sweeter coffee cake but still very off-putting. Also, the cake batter was too thick to pour and I had to smear it into the pan. Hodgson Mill needs to change this produce or lose it all together. It is sad because I love their gluten free oats, buckwheat cereal, flax seed, baking powder, xanthan gum, etc. I would try Pamela's multi-purpose baking mix, it tastes more like the real thing.

review/summary: NOT USER FRIENDLY
review/text: A BAD mix from a GOOD company. Hodgson Mills makes many good products. This IS NOT one of them. It is NOT the "gluten free" version of Bisquick or any other quick baking mix. There is nothing quick about this. All that is in this product is a few varieties of Gluten free flours. There is no sugar, baking powder, baking soda, egg, guar or xanthan gum (nothing to hold the finished product together for those of you who are new to Gluten Free Baking). Items you try to make with this mix as is will fall apart and taste bad. In other words, this is a mix you HAVE to experiment with in order to make things come out looking or tasting good at all. Most of us who have to eat Gluten Free foods are looking for shortcuts like every other busy person on the planet. This mix will add to your busy time, not relieve you. Try Bob's Red Mill Baking Mix or the Gluten Free Pantry Baking Mix for a better experience.

Sadly, it tastles like potting soil smells.  I tried making the coffee cake recipe that one of the earlier reviewers loved, and it was rancidly bad.  I got goosebumps it was so bad--no lie.  Thirty minutes later I still feel that I should have daisies planted in my mouth.  Buy the Gluten-free Pantry flour.  It is pretty close to what I remember regular flout tasting like without the dirtlike aftertaste.

review/text: I bought these macarons through Groupon and only spent $24. When they arrived, the cool pack was warm to the touch. The macarons were wrapped in plastic in sets of 12. I was excited to have that fresh macaron taste, but I was sorely disappointed. They lacked the typical moisture and the flavors were a bit bland. Even though I put them in the fridge, they are getting harder and less tasteful by the minute. I guess nothing beats fresh macarons from Paris!

The birthday came and went and finally found out after that the macarons were delivered elsewhere.  I called and emailed Dessert Hub repeatedly, no one answered the phone, called me back or responded to my emails.  I would never deal with that company again.

review/summary: Yummy! (at least the cats think so)
review/text: I have four cats, and trying to get them all to eat the same food was a real chore.  They were on the Wellness Core kitten/cat formula, but my older two were not gaining the weight that they needed to for some reason.  So I decided to switch their food after over a year.  I really agonized over the change since I do have one cat that is a VERY picky eater.  I can't even begin to describe how delighted I was when I put this in their bowl and she was the first one to run over and start to gobble it up.  They have been eating it for a couple of months now, and the two older cats have started to gain their weight back.  I am a happy owner and my cats are happy fuzzballs.  :)

I like that they are not getting meat by-products, corn and wheat since 1 cat has some food allergies.  He also used to gorge on the purina and then promptly throw it up.  This is expensive, but since they eat it much slower, it appears to equal out some in price and have much better ingredients for them.  We'll stick with this one for a while!

It might as well be tuna to them, they go crazy over it- even compared to Blue Buffalo's other flavors and other premium pet foods. The ingredients are comparable with more expensive pet foods. It still seems a little pricey at first, but my cats seem satisfied with the small portions recommended on the bag. Small portions = less litter waste too. The LifeSource Bits were a major selling point for me, but I wish the information on them was less ambiguous. The only thing I did not like was that my cats didn't seem to feel the need to chew the tiny kibbles very often.

They were the cheapest treat you could buy in the store, at about a nickle each. That's what these brownies remind me of and that's not a good thing. These things are very dense, not in a GOOD "chewy-chocolaty-moist and gooey" kind of way, but more along the lines of "grainy-gummy-rubbery and nasty. The is very little flavor and no distinction between the cream filling and the chocolate shell.

I also tried it with bruschetta bread and found I ate too many pieces! In fact it was dinner one night with a salad.There are so many uses for this sauce. If you like tomatoes and artichokes, you will love this product. When you read other reviews you will see adverse comments on packaging. I think the manufacturer must have corrected it since the jars came in a nicely made, well fitting box lined with styrofoam on the top and bottom and dividers.  The product containers are thick plastic with a screw on lid that could also be reused. I washed a couple in my DW and they held up perfectly.

review/summary: Heavy Olive/Brine Flavor
review/text: I found this product to have a heavy olive brine flavor to it.  The product had little tomato flavor and while there are plenty of artichokes all I really taste is olive.  I added fresh diced tomato prior to using with guests.

review/summary: Just does not taste good :(
review/text: I have bought Artichoke Bruschetta spread at Costco and I have made it myself. I love the stuff. I was pretty excited to see this available on amazon. It even comes beautifully packaged. Unfortunately this is a poorly seasoned tomato sauce with a few chunks of pitted olives and artichokes floating in it. It is not really thick enough to be a bruschetta topping and I really did not care for the way it was seasoned at all. It had an almost licorice taste to it that overpowered everything else. I am not even sure how I can doctor it into something we will eat. I am bummed.

review/summary: This is DELICIOUS!!
review/text: I've tried many Scarpetta products but this one is truly scrumptious!  Some of the other reviews stated that the jars arrived outdated.  I've had that happen to me too.....once before..... and just ended up throwing out the four jars since they were UNDOUBTEDLY spoiled.  Unfortunately I never thought to complain to Amazon and ask for replacements......live and learn.....I knew food could not be returned but replacing bad, outdated food.....I should have realized I could do that!!  However, those were the sauce, not this bruschetta topping.  This topping has a wonderful fresh home-made tomato flavor and the artichokes are whole and delicious.  I ate two of the jars on bagel chips but just used a spoon on the third.  Mmmmmm good!!  The fourth jar I gave as a gift to my uncle.  He did not care for this bruschetta as much as the ones his many friends make for him becaue they use lots and lots of garlic and black olives which he loves much more than artichokes.  This topping is mild but so very flavorful.  If I don't eat it all just by itself, I'll try it on fish or chicken like some of the other reviewers suggested.  It really is a very versatile topping.  I highly recommend it to everyone.

review/summary: Scarpetta Tomato and Artichoke Bruschetta Topping
review/text: I first had bruschetta at a house warming. I was stunned by how fantastic it was. This particular product does have a generous amount of artichokes and is very yum, but not quite as good as fresh homemade. Goes well with toasty garlic rubbed bread. The container has a tamper-evident seal under the screw-down lid that needs to be fully removed before it is safe for the microwave. Even the smallest bit that remains on the edge can spark up and release some nasty smoke that not only smells bad, but can flavor your bruschetta in a bad way.

review/text: I was away from almost all civilization and wanted chrysanthemum tea so amazon.com saved me by selling it online. I received it in great strong packaging (perhaps too much since it was a box with the product and filler within another box). The flowers looked clean and fresh and when brewed it produced a nice light yellow tea. It tastes just as good or better than the usual Chinese chrysanthemum tea I'm used to, so I'm very happy with this product. I would also highly recommend buying loose leaf or loose flower teas so you can adjust it to your own or guest's tastes!

review/summary: Extremely Helpful for Eye Strain - Terrific Natural Remedy
review/text: I was really developing a problem with computer eye strain/syndrome.  I am pretty well-read on this subject and I was trying to address it in different ways, but NOTHING helped the way that white chrysanthemum tea does.<br /><br />To quote thelistlady: "The chrysanthemum has long been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for eye care. The flower is beneficial for correcting imbalances in kidney and liver function that is a cause of dry eyes, blurred vision, dizziness, spots in front of the eyes and excessive tearing. One of my favorite TCM doctors, Dr. Maoshing Ni, writes in his book "Secrets of Longevity" about how chrysanthemum flowers reduce pressure buildup in the eyes.<br /><br />Some flowers are awfully beneficial for the eyes.  Many eye supplements contain marigold extracts.<br /><br />Leave it to God's garden to provide awesome remedies for the things that ail us.<br /><br />Chrysanthemum blends well with "clean" green and white teas if you are in the market for caffeine.  Otherwise you can drink it on its own for its fantastic health benefits.

review/summary: Toastiest, perfectly salted, Sunflower Seeds
review/text: With God's helping hand, we recently walked the 500 miles from St. Jean Pied de Port, France to Santiago de Compostela, Spain. I bought a bag of Facundo Extra Grandes Pipas (or Sunflower Seeds as we know them here in the States)and was hooked.<br /><br />I sometimes couldn't find this brand to buy along the way, and didn't enjoy the other brands in comparison, either they were too salty, or not fresh enough. So when I found a Tienda that carried this brand I would by 4 or 5 packs at a time, even though keeping pack weight as light as possible was so crucial.<br /><br />I just finished my last pack now that we are home and went online to find more. But all the sources available are sold out. I will have to go back to my regular brand, which in no way compares to these Extra Grandes.<br /><br />By-the-way, this Pilgrimage was an amazing undertaking. And enjoying the sunflower seeds as I walked was very insignificant in the whole scheme of things. If you would like to know more, read "Hiking the Camino, 500 miles with Jesus" by Fr. Dave.

review/text: I am a frequent user of bully sticks from other vendors online and from pet stores. These are listed as "THICK" bully sticks. I usually buy thick ones from another vendor and my German Shepherd pup loves them and they last a couple of days. These arrived and I was immediately disappointed. Many of them are the thickness of a pencil or slightly thicker. They are about 1/3 the thickness of the "thick" bully sticks I usually buy. But I did not want to deal with sending them back so I gave one to my pup. It smelled HORRIBLE, like a person who had not washed in weeks. My pup liked them okay but because they are so thin she can eat an entire, 12" one in under an hour. Will NOT buy these again.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Bully Sticks
review/text: I purchased the 12" bully sticks (7 pack) from Downtown Pet Supply about a week ago.  One of my two dogs recently passed away, and the other was feeling a little depressed.  I wanted to give her a "special treat", but also hoped that these would help perk up her poor appetite since her sister's passing.  Boy have these done the trick!  I let her chew on the stick for about 30 minutes & then took it away.  Low and behold, she remembered she was hungry and ate all of her food!  She is a 50lb Lab mix who is very healthy at 13.5 years old.  In the past I had purchased 6" bully sticks at a local pet supply store for $5 each.  These sticks come out to be just under $3.50/stick and are twice the size!  This purchase was well worth it -- quality product for a great price.  I will re-order again.  Thank you!

review/text: I was hesitant to purchase this product after reading other reviews about them not being "thick".  But, since I couldn't find any other thick bully sticks on here, I thought I'd give them a shot.  Well, I am very disappointed!  They are not thick at all.  They are the same, "slim jim" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!

review/summary: Great New Sauce!!!
review/text: My brother suggested I try some of this BBQ sauce. It's literally the best I've ever had. Sweet yet just a little tangy and full flavored. I'd recommend it highly to anyone. You'd think that there couldn't be a new great BBQ sauce with everything that's on the shelves, but this is special.

review/summary: Dress it Up, Dress it Down - The Very, Very Best Salad Dressing Ever
review/text: I'm a salad nut and picky about what I put in and on my daily salads.  I grew up on Good Seasons dressings and have used them for well over forty - ok, almost fifty years now  - yes, they have been around that long!  They are the best tasting salad dressings out there, and while I've used many, many other dressings over the years - from bottled to homemade - the Good Seasons Salad Dressing family is my favorite.<br /><br />Back in the 60s I think we always made the dressings with vegetable oil and apple cider vinegar, but after I got out on my own and widened my food horizons, I find I love Good Seasons even more. Vinegar is the big secret with these dressings - change the type of vinegar you use and you dramatically change the flavor!  In the 80s I started using red wine and white wine vinegars, which gave it a whole new taste.  In the 90s Basalmic vinegar was the way to go and my foodie friends were never so impressed!  Now my vinegar of choice is a rice vinegar, especially with the Zesty Italian and this flavor - Garlic and Herb.  But other vinegars are great too - try it with malt vinegar for a change of pace.<br /><br />My other trick is that I now make my dressing with a healthier canola oil, rather than the vegetable oil of the old days.  I've also made it with olive oils, but I don't use olive oil as a general rule, only because the oil solidifies in the refrigerator and you have to take it out ahead of time to soften it.  I'm just not that good at planning ahead, so I'll stick with canola.  I also use a bit more of both the oil and vinegar than the package recommends - I like the taste a bit better and I get a wee bit more dressing for each package.<br /><br />And now that I've found my favorite salad dressing on Amazon, life just got better yet.  The prices in the grocery stores had gone way up over the years to over $2.25 a pack, but now I can buy 16 to 24 packages of dressing for over a buck per package less.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: The Best Salad Dressing!
review/text: I've been using Good Seasons Garlic & Herb Salad Dressing for years.  It is especially good for pasta salads and 3 or 4 bean salads.  I use canola oil and rice wine vinegar and I'm sure those two make a difference too.  But Garlic & Herb isn't sold anywhere I can find it around Boise, Idaho so I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  I've tried other dressings - bottled and packaged but none can compare to this one. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZCI">Good Seasons Salad Dressing & Recipe Mix, Garlic & Herb, 0.75-Ounce Packets (Pack of 24)</a>  I've stocked up.

review/summary: Good deal in bulk
review/text: This is pretty much the only salad dressing that my husband will eat.  it's difficult to remember to pick it up from the grocery, and it's never on sale.  Purchasing through the Subscribe and Save method is the way to go, and with a pack of two dozen, running out is not a problem.<br />As for the product itself, I'll admit it's one of the tastier commercially-available dressings on the market, and especially tasty when prepared with canola oil.  Highly recommend this flavor over the original Italian, and very much recommend it over the too-sour-tasting Zesty Italian.  The garlic flavor is pervasive throughout, and it is very easy to prepare.<br />I'm a fan of homemade salad dressing myself, but like I say, this stuff is my hubby's fav.

Granted, I put a lot of great ingredients in my green salad, avocado, kidney beans, garbanzo beans, whole kernel corn, grated cheese, black olives but so do other people.  I finally realized it was the salad dressing I was using.  Everyone always asked me what it was.  I have given up using any other salad dressing a long time ago and I buy this one by the case at Amazon so I will always have it available for the next party potluck I go to as no one ever asks me to bring anything else but my green salad but what they are really asking for is my Garlic & Herb Salad Dressing.

review/text: This is a delicious sauce. On the spicy side, which I like. I made chicken enchiladas and poured the whole jar over the top before baking. Nice and cheesy tasting with a great kick. The reason for the 4 stars is just a personal one for I was a little put off by the color. When I order white cheese sauce in a Mexican restaurant the sauce is just that, white. This sauce is not "blanco" in my opinion. It is a beige color which has nothing to do with the taste by any means. Just not what I expected. Obviously I was not put off too much for I placed another order for 3 jars. Try it if you like spicy! Its good.

review/text: The dessert recipe i wanted to make called for a mango syrup.  Since i haven't tasted the Torani and the Monin mango syrups, i decided to give both a try. Growing up eating Philippine mangoes during the mango season will pretty much give me an idea of how mangoes should taste like.<br />IMO, the Torani mango syrup doesn't taste like it has real mango in it, tastes very artificial.<br />On the other hand, the Monin mango syrup surely would have artificial ingredients in it too but Monin did a pretty good job of making the syrup taste more like pureed mango.  I love Monin.  I hope that the Rose and the Lavender syrups i bought just now won't disappoint as well.
