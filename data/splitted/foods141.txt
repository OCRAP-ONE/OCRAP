review/summary: It's Good to Be Wrong
review/text: I ordered this with tongue in cheek.  I really expected it to taste powdery and be a poor substitute for "real" PB.  My goal was to try it in smoothies.<br /><br />Sometimes it's good to be wrong.  I use it for PB and banana smoothies every morning.  Wow!  I cannot believe how good it is!  Not powdery or chalky tasting, yummy enough to eat right out of the jar. . . almost.<br /><br />I looked at the website for other ways to use it and found more recipes than I expected and they cover all meals and types of foods.  One day soon I'll try using it to make phad thai or PB cookies...maybe both.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Your peanut fix
review/text: I first discovered this product through a discussion on Facebook and tried it blind based on this. Per the item description, this is powdered peanut butter... not just powdered peanuts. Like peanut butter, this also has salt and sugar, but is missing the oil. The strong peanut buttery flavor this provides is spot on and like other reviewers have said, is great to mix into other foods. I've tried to reconstitute it in order to spread on toast. You can do this but it's more trouble than it's worth impo.  This would probably be great in cookie recipes as the lack of oil wouldn't interfere with the consistency of the batter.<br /><br />Overall this is a great product that delivers as promised.<br /><br />>>P.S - Resist the urge to eat a spoonful of this stuff plain. You *will* choke...  so I hear ;-)  &lt;&lt;

review/summary: No basic directions
review/text: I made a peanut sauce with this and it was very good though not as smooth as with real PB. My beef with it is the lack of basic instructions on how much powder and water to use to make basic peanut butter.- there are recipes other website but not specific guidance on the mix you would use if just substituting peanut butter. Am I an idiot? Maybe... Still, if you need 2Tbs of peanut butter you will use almost 4 Tbs. I have only used it once so did not get good measurements because there was lots of adding more water or powder and also I usually weigh ingredients and as another reviewer pointed out the weight and volume on the label didn't match. This of course affects the calories and if you are counting them this matters to you.<br />I read reviews about price and didn't think much of it- it didn't seem that bad for a jar of PB but in a recipe that used 1/2c of PB I used at least 1/3rd of the jar so yeah, kinda pricey... It is what it is and I won't knock a star off but just keep in mind that this does not make a jar of PB which should have been obvious but then maybe I'm an idiot!

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: Woah...wasn't expecting this to be as good as it is, honestly. When mixed with water, the consistency is a dead ringer for regular peanut butter and the taste is spot on. I was expecting bland, chalky paste but it definitely is nothing like that. MMM! So good! Excited to try it in/on everything!! If you're on the fence, just give it a try. For way under $10, and way under the regular fat content of regular peanut butter, this stuff is a god-send!

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: Wow! i was pretty surprised at how well this actually turned out! i had my doubts about the texture mostly, but combining with water really works! i also tried with milk and cream(kinda defeats the purpose XD), and it only does a little for texture and taste. I wouldnt compare the taste to that of natural or organic PB though, as it tastes more like Skippy, Peter Pan, and Jiffy. My favorite is combining 2Tbsp PB2 with 1Tbsp of regular, but im so happy that i can finally snack on  peanut butter without worrying about the calories! Also doesnt sit in your stomach like regular peanut butter can. Over a great product and i will continue to get it!

review/summary: Powdered Peanut Butter
review/text: Being a peanut butter lover, have to keep it out of my house or it disappears way too fast.  So when I found powdered peanut butter (with more than half the fat removed, but with the same peanutty taste), I was in heaven.<br /><br />Now I can mix it with my yogurt and/or ice cream; make my peanut butter pie and don't feel quite as guilty while totally enjoying the flavor.<br /><br />And ... so does my daughter-in-law who is a big fan of peanut butter also.<br /><br />So for all those peanut butter lovers out there, I highly recommend the Powdered Peanut Butter!!!

review/text: This product is an excellent addition to my morning protein shakes. I have used this product every morning for the last 45 days in my chocolate high protein shake to give it a Peanut Butter Chocolate Treat to it. Sometimes when I am craving a nighttime sweet dessert I use chocolate protein with the PB2 to create an amazing dessert to curb my cravings. This works great especially for those watching what you eat and trying to lose weight.

review/text: I really like the flavor, not exactly like real peanut butter but still tasty. And I don't feel bad about eating it like I do when I eat 10 grams of fat on regular peanut butter. I do agree with the previous review, price is high especially since it doesn't last as long as the regular PB. Although there always seems to be a higher price on unique products like this one. I bought both the original PB and Chocolate PB, I like original better. I'll buy it again.

review/summary: PB2 Is A Dream Come True!
review/text: After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!<br /><br />The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry!

review/text: I decided to try PB2 after hearing a couple friends talking about it.  I'm so glad I did. PB2 has a nice peanut flavor without all the fat and calories. I add it to my weight-loss shakes for a little extra flavor.  It's also good stirred into muffin or pancake mixes, or sprinkled on top of greek yogurt and eaten with a apple.  I don't really reconstitute it--I just use it to get the peanut flavor without all the calories.  Great product!

review/summary: It's a MUST BUY!
review/text: I was skeptical about this peanut butter product at first, but when I tried it I was pleasantly surprised!  The ingredients: peanuts, salt and sugar.  Doesn't get more pure than that!  I'm on the old Weight Watcher's Points plan and this PB2 is 1 point for two tablespoons! As a comparison, two tablespoons of "regular" store bought peanut butter is 5 points. The taste difference between this peanut butter and store bought peanut butter is so slight that it's not worth the extra calories to buy the "ready to eat" peanut butter.<br /><br />This product comes in a dry form. You add two tablespoons of the dry mix to one tablespoon of water, stir, and you have delicious peanut butter!!  It can be added to smoothies, to!!!  I would definitely get this product. I also bought the chocolate kind, but have yet to try it.

review/text: I was definitely skeptical about trying powdered peanut butter.  Grew up with Peter Pan and as a choosy adult, have been choosing Creamy Jif for a decade, but just had to try this based on 85% less fat and all the amazing reviews.  Recently been losing weight with Weight Watchers, so figured I'd give it a shot especially as a substitute in cooking and baking.  Received PB2 a few days ago -- WOW!  Love the stuff!  I've been telling everyone about it.  It's got a great flavor, and then when you consider that it's got 85% less fat, it's got AMAZING flavor!  Really!  I don't think you would be able to tell the difference on a sandwich.  I'm a by the spoonful kind of girl and the PB2 is totally satisfying.  Give it a shot.  I don't think you'll be sorry!

review/summary: Awesome product!
review/text: I have read other reviews on here, and thought I would throw in my thoughts.  I have been eating PB2 for a couple of years now.  What I have read from other users is that 2 tbsp of powder shrinks down to 2 tsp when mixed.  I have NEVER had this happen.  I mix 2 tbsp with 1 (plus a little extra) water and have a large amount (I'm talking 2 full tbsp) of "peanut butter" for my sandwich.  I would never put as much real peanut butter on a sandwich as I do this.  So, I don't know if I am doing it wrong, but I find this product to be great for sandwiches, especially if you are watching calorie intake.<br />The price is a little high, but I find it to be worth it.

review/text: As a regular all natural peanut butter eater, this product intrigued me with its low calories, and much lower fat. While the fat in natural peanut butter is the good kind (mono and poly) its nice to have a peanut butter that you can eat in larger quantities if desired without adding 40 grams of fat to your daily intake. I love th&eacute; cooking possibilities with this powder. It really tastes almost as good as other peanut butter... There's a slight difference I just can't put my finger on. But I enjoy it and recommend it.

Not only is it much more convenient than jarred peanut butter (MUCH easier to spread/prepare and bake with especially) but it also tastes better to me; much more "peanut" flavor, not too sweet but always sweet enough, and with the option of sweetening it extra if you like. Plus you can't beat the nutritional stats on this baby. I'll never go back to regular peanut butter again!

review/text: I've recently changed a lot of my eating habits in order to lose weight and cutting calories was key in my plans. PB2 was recommended to me by a friend who knew how much I loved peanut butter but had been abstaining from it due to the high calorie count. While PB2 is not exactly like normal peanut butter the taste and texture are very close and similar enough not to bother me. The product mixes together very well and the calorie deficit when compared to normal peanut butter makes this a no-brainer. Give it a try!

review/summary: I can have peanut butter again!
review/text: This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe.

review/summary: Pretty tasty and very handy for the health conscious
review/text: Dont go into this thinking after you mix up your peanut butter that it will taste like what you are familiar with. It wont. This isnt laden with the sugars and oils that give most store brand peanut butters the flavor people are familiar with. In fact, most of the oil from the peanut is pressed out of this as well. This is just straight up peanut butter without any frills (well, it is after you mix water into it anyway). Personally, I like it, and besides, there is plenty sugar in jelly anyway if you are gonna eat a PB&J using this, which I do from time to time. For me, it's primary use is in smoothies though. This powder is perfect for that. It blends thoroughly and you dont get all that aforementioned sugar and oil (and usually transfats) that comes with using most normal peanut butters, which basically means you arent adding junk to your diet. I would recommend however that if you planning to use this exclusively for sandwiches and are concerned about the lack of sweetness, that you try a brand like Justin's instead. For me though, this is pretty much perfect.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Excellant Replacement to Peanut Butter
review/text: I tried this PB2 after reading about it in the Hungry Girl Cookbook. I was amazed at how wonderful it was. You can tell that there is no oil in the product so it is a little less creamy than real peanut butter. I LOVE peanut butter, but was doing weight watchers and couldnt justify using my points for real peanut butter. With PB2 I could eat peanut butter all the time and not feel guilty! It gets a little creamier when used with warm toast or on an English Muffin.<br /><br />I brough PB2 to work one day and introduced it to my co-workers. They asked to buy the jar I had left! They then ordered SIX jars for themselves. If you dont mind the calories, you might want to stick to regular peanut butter. But if you want an alternative that tastes just like peanut butter without the oil... this is EXCELLANT. I now actually prefer this to real peanut butter!!

review/text: I first learned of PB2 from a Weight Watchers forum. Everyone was raving, so I thought I'd try it. I am so glad I did! While not as sweet or smooth as "normal" peanut butter, the essential flavor is there. I highly recommend PB2 to anyone "on the fence" about ordering it...you'll be glad you did!

review/text: I really like this product!  I first read about it in my Diabetic Living magazine and since I love peanut butter, wanted to give it a try.  While it will never replace the real thing, it had a really good roasted peanut flavor and a smooth, creamy texture.  I ate it smeared over two Corn Thin cakes, with 1/2 tbsp of reduced sugar jam and it was really satisfying, all for 104 calories! I probably won't eat this by the spoonful, like I love to do with peanut butter, but it will be great in sandwiches or with apples as a healthy snack.  I am very satisfied with the taste and texture of this peanut butter.  Yay!

review/text: I appreciate those science geeks out there who spent the time to create a process to take 85% of the fat and calories out of peanut butter!  Who knew that was even possible?  PB2 makes it very easy to add protein to my oatmeal, protein shakes, etc., and saves me some of the fat and calories I used to get using regular peanut butter.  It certainly doesn't take the place of peanut butter in every situation, but I am thankful for this tasty option as I'm working on getting healthier.

I LOOOOVE peanut butter, so much so that I do not have in the house because I know that i will end up eating the whole jar.  Well I ordered PB2 not expecting much, but WOOWW I was blown away.  It tastes exactly like peanut butter. IT lives up to all the reviews.  If they have it in a bigger size I will be ordering it or maybe in multiple jars. I mixed it and put in the Arctic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor and I swear I almost cried, it was so good.  It was like omg. I could have a pint of chocolate peanut butter ice cream for only 240 calories.  I could have my favorite treat every day and still fit into my size 8 jeans.  Glory, Glory!!!

review/summary: tastes great mixed into cereal or oatmeal, but a little pricey
review/text: I've always loved peanut butter and have been inclined to mix a spoonful or two into whatever I happen to be eating.  This is a great way to get that wonderful peanut butter taste without the fat, calories, and gloppiness of peanut butter.  The powder form makes it great for stirring into soups or oatmeal or sprinkling on yogurt.  I've tried it reconstituted as well, but I don't think it has quite the same consistency of peanut butter as the real stuff, so I woudn't be inclined to use this like peanut butter in a sandwich or just eat it by the spoonful.  It does impart a nice flavor though, and I don't detect any weird or chemically aroma or flavors -- it's just nice and peanutty.<br /><br />I ordered this and a version of PB2 with chocolate.  PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack.  Frankly, I couldn't tell much difference between the two.  They both have a strong peanutty flavor.  I think I will stick with just this plain version if I order it again.

review/summary: Healthy substitute for peanut butter
review/text: I just got my PB2 in the mail today, and I was very curious as to how it would taste. I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip.

review/summary: Great as a mix-in, not by itself
review/text: Just as so many other reviewers have stated, PB2 is absolutely wonderful in shakes! Everyone has their own kind of shakes they make and for me, it's Slim-Fast + fat-free milk + 1 tbsp of PB2 + some ice in a blender. It is a great tasting chocolate peanut butter shake! I have not used the PB2 in other similar ways. I enjoy my shake so much though, that I will continue to buy the PB2 for it.<br /><br />That being said.. I mixed it to make it just like a peanut butter- 2 tbsp of powder + 1 tbsp of water. I spread it on an English muffin (I love an English muffin with peanut butter). Unlike other reviews, I have to say, that was not pleasant at all. The consistency was fine but I'd give up peanut butter altogether before doing that again. In my opinion, it was awful tasting and even made me sick to my stomach while I was eating it and for a while after I had finished.<br /><br />Even though I disliked the PB2 prepared with water, I still give it 4 stars because it is such a great mix-in and I will continue to make my chocolate peanut butter shakes with it. I will have to keep my natural Jif peanut butter though for sandwiches until there's a truly adequate/great tasting substitute. I've seen several dieticians and they have all said it's a good idea to fit in natural peanut butter into the diet for the healthy fats, but just don't overdo it. I've lost 20 lbs and still incorporated natural peanut butter into my diet, so it can be done (again, moderation).<br /><br />Nutrition: The nutrition is also why this product is so popular! With 1.5 grams of fat, 5 grams of carbs, 2 grams of Fiber and 5 grams of Protein, this is a great choice and it is diabetic friendly. :)

review/summary: Awesome idea, but too expensive
review/text: PB is a major source of calories, so this is a pretty great idea. However, it's honestly just too expensive to purchase as a regular replacement for peanut butter. The taste is just OK: when mixed with water, it tastes vaguely like peanut butter, but it's tough to get a very similar texture. Mixed in protein shakes, though, it's absolutely great. I would buy it exclusively for that purpose if the price were a bit more reasonable.

review/summary: Sprinkle it on Yogurt
review/text: I really enjoy this and can enjoy it because the calories are so low. I like to sprinkle it on yogurt...apple, banana, plain...it's really yummy. My daughter puts it into her protein shake in the morning and has said dipping banana pieced or celery is also good. We've finished the jar and are starting on the 16oz pack. I hope this is a product that will stay around!

review/text: While I think this is 'ok' as far as using as peanut butter (better than all the peanut butter substitutes I've tried, but still a weird peanut butter consistency), what it excels at is sauces and dips. Great for veggie dips. AWESOME added in at the end of a stir fry, to give a great peanut flavor and to thicken your sauce. It is outstanding some fresh udon noodles, a little black bean soy sauce, some stir fried meat and veggies (stir fried in broth, not oil), then add it at the end to thicken the broth/soy for an excellently flavoured and low fat dinner.

review/summary: Peanut Butter is back on the menu!
review/text: Peanut butter was one of the things I reluctantly gave up while I lost weight. Through diet and lots of exercise, I lost 50 pounds, and have kept it off for several years now. I thought I'd never have peanut butter again - until I saw this in the organic aisle of the grocery store. Well hello, peanut butter, welcome back! :) I love this stuff. It's like whipped peanut butter. I mix 2 tablespoons with 3/4 tablespoons of water, as I like it thick.<br /><br />Try this for breakfast:<br /><br />In a blender:<br />8 ounces of milk (I use 60 calorie original flavor almond milk)<br />1 serving size of powdered chocolate flavored carnation instant breakfast<br />1 tablespoon powdered PB2 right out of the jar<br /><br />- mix until smooth. OMG, it's like drinking a liquid Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.<br /><br />I can have peanut butter again and still fit into my skinny jeans! :)<br /><br />(PS: the amazon price has GOT to be wrong. I only paid $4.99 for a 6.5 oz jar at the grocery store the other day. Check your local grocery stores, or better yet, the Bell Plantation website where you can buy it cheaper in bulk!)

review/summary: Great Product...awful price on Amazon
review/text: Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees.

review/text: I was very impressed with the taste of this peanut butter. After playing around a bit with the water to powder ratio, I got a smooth creamy spread that was fantastic on a piece of bread.<br /><br />Be sure to measure out the amount you want by weight, not volume. I am dinging them one star because their serving size is 21g or 2 tbps. I found that 21g came out a bit over 1 tbps, but it is definitely not 2! Since most people are likely buying this to watch their calories, that's a big error. You still end up with enough to comfortably cover a piece of bread.

review/text: I really like the taste of this powder.  It is great in a protein shake, especially with 1/2 banana blended in.  My issue is with the shelf life of the product.  A 6.5 oz container lasts a long time, but the container that I purchased from Amazon expired in less than a month from the purchase date.  I noticed that the date of production was exactly a year ago.  Most protein powders have a shelf life of a couple of years.

review/summary: Misleading calorie count--lots more than 45 calories per serving!!!
review/text: I Loooove peanut better and this ersatz butter tastes pretty good to me and has 0 cholesterol. Nevertheless, because of its high calorie count and high price, I can stretch the rating to only 3 stars. Yes, the taste is good but, in order to get a 2 tablespoon serving, you need at least 6 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, 2 tablespoons of the powder mixed with 1 of water will yield only about 1.5 teaspoons of spreadable "peanut butter"-- Barely enough to coat half a slice of bread. And so...one serving (2 tablespoonsful) of the mixture ends up being 135 calories--not 45 calories which is the count for 2 tablespoons of the powder. If you're counting calories and pennies, you might as well get the regular peanut butter for less than half the price of the dry stuff.

review/text: This product is not ready to use.  If you're willing to mix it up each time, it's a decent product.  The peanut butter taste is solid - it's just missing the fat. My 15 year old son doesn't notice the difference at all when it's in a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, and he doesn't seem to miss the fat.  He eats a peanut butter and jelly sandwich every day for lunch and switched to PB2 at the suggestion of a nutritionist.  He lost half a pound a week since he switched, obviously combined with an overall healthy diet.  I recommend it for kids, not sure if adults will be fooled.

review/summary: Just know what you're getting
review/text: The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as "PB2" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again).

review/text: You want to remove the sugar from peanut butter not the fat. And honestly this tastes bad in comparison.<br /><br />Roughly 50 percent of the fat in peanuts is monounsaturated. Unsaturated fats can help lower LDL cholesterol (the "bad" cholesterol) levels in the blood without affecting the HDL cholesterol ("good" cholesterol). Research shows that people who eat a greater percentage of monounsaturated fats lower their risk of heart disease, asthma, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, and even depression.<br /><br />Just buy the natural kind and avoid the additives.

Next, I tried shaking it from the jar onto the bread, but when I picked the bread up, it fell clean off. Someone suggested I put the jelly on first, but when I did that then stuck the knife into the jar, all I ended up with was a messy knife-still wouldn't spread.<br /><br />I finally gave up and just opened my mouth, put my head back and dumped the stuff directly onto my awaiting tastebuds.

review/text: This product really deserves 4 or 5 stars for the product itself.  However, as others have noted, Amazon has WAY overpriced it.  The manufacturer has its own website where it is much, much cheaper.
