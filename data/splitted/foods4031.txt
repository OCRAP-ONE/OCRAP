review/summary: Loree's Love of Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars
review/text: I really like the Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars and have for some time.  However, I can no longer find them in the grocery stores in my locale.  The boxes of Cinnamon bars stopped being available some years ago, and recently they were no longer available in the variety pack either.  It was a pleasure being able to purchase them again.

review/summary: Hits the Sweet Spot
review/text: When those late night cravings hit, Nature Valley Crunchy Cinnamon Granola Bars are a healthy and low calorie way to satisfy that sweet tooth. At only 90 calories each these bars have just the right amount of cinnamon richness and crunch so much so that it almost feels sinful. The bars come conveniently packaged in 6 boxes of 12 each. For an exceptionally decadent treat, try crumbling the bars over a scoop of coffee ice cream. Since the bars are individually wrapped, they're also an excellent on-the-go snack. I throw them in lunches or in my backpack when I'm in a hurry.

review/summary: Finally!! A way to get this great  Nature Valley flavor
review/text: I don't know about you, but when the family has a FAVORITE FLAVOR, you really are on the "bad" list if you vary from that request. The Nature Valley granola bars are one of our staples for snacks. With a piece of fruit it will fil in the hunger pangs on the way back from a game. It is also a favorite with coffee, allowing you to pass up calorie dense junk foods available everywhere. The cinnamon flavor is hard to find, so I was thrilled to find it availble by the case on Amazon. It arrived within a week of my order and it worked out to cost about.50 less per box than if purchased at the local supermarket, the only one that has this flavor. This method of stocking up is convenient and cost effective.

review/summary: Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola Bars
review/text: My husband goes on several business trips, and a few backpacking trips, each year. He loves the Cinnamon granola bars for a fast, easy, breakfast. Light enough to carry in his backpack and filling along with his morning coffee.<br />I could not find the packages of only the cinnamon flavor, in the stores, for a very long time. I was pleased, as was he, to find them on Amazon.com. I bought a whole case. The price, including the shipping charge for the case, was actually a couple of dollars less than buying the same amount at a store.<br />Thank You,

review/summary: Expiration date close, product really dry
review/text: June 28, 2011. The Expiration date. Ordered Jan 17, delivered Jan 21st. The product is really dry. Drier than usual. I mean yes these bars are really crunchy, but the Oats and Honey that came in the Variety Pack I also bought wasn't as dry as these. Part of me wonders if these have been on the shelf for too long and Amazon decided to put them on a subscribe and save sale to rotate the stock.<br /><br />I bought these or emergency supplies in case of a natural disaster or something but now I see I'll have to eat them all in 5 months. That's pretty bad to me.<br /><br />Yes people say they seem to love these and they can't find them on store shelves and I guess in that case it's great. But I do want to question how old these are as some products I see expiring two years (about) in the future. So just buyer beware in the case that you are the sole consumer and aren't part of a larger group who might eat these.

review/summary: Good Ingredients & The Dogs Love Them
review/text: I have respect for the Wellness brand and have previously bought my dogs other Wellness treats.  These WellBars are marketed as "bite size."  My corgis love them!  And, they can certainly eat them in one bite.  But, for a medium dog, I consider these larger than bite size.  Luckily, the bars are easily broken in two to provide a smaller snack.  (Weight maintenance is a high priority with my chow hounds.)<br /><br />Each bar has 24 calories.  The first few ingredients are:  ground barley, cane molasses, ground brown rice, whitefish, and sweet potatoes.  There's no wheat, corn, soy, artificial preservatives/color/flavor.<br /><br />This is a big box of treats.  I do wish that the bag was resealable, but that's a quibble.

He does have some food allergies (corn & wheat), so I didn't detract from the treats' rating.  My best guess is that he reacted to the cane molasses because he's never eaten it before.

review/summary: Bad for teeth
review/text: Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.  They're also made by Wellness.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004B9GNPM">Old Mother Hubbard Classic Oven Baked Chick' N' Apples Dog Biscuits</a> Or, Get Naked dog biscuits, which are also very good.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002L80MZ2">Get Naked Super Antioxidant Biscuits for Dogs, 12-Ounce</a>

review/summary: SMELLS GOOD even I want to eat it
review/text: This smells so good . Doesnt' smell like cardboard boxes. Comes in thick plastic bag to prevent puncture and letting the freshness go out.  There's no sealable zipper or anything so I have to use a clothing pin.<br /><br />My dog eats it when she wants to.  I leave it next to her bed she won't touch it sometimes. But sometimes she does eat it up.  She should eat it up fast or else it will become stale.<br /><br />Smells fruity and a hint of gingersnap cookies.  I gave it to another dog and he ate it like there was no tomorrow.  I gave my dog a wellness lamb jerky .. she ate it like crazy. I gave the other dog lamb jerky... he ate it like crazy.<br /><br />My conclusion is that not all dogs like fruity gingersnap cookies. Still have 60% left.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very good but I should stick to a guarantee treat....the lamb or any line meat jerky offered by Wellness.<br /><br />Not sure if I can eat it . lol

review/text: These are the best ones of the Wellness bars because they're completely grain free. My dogs love these. They also contain no artificial preservatives. Highly recommended. However, I wish these came in a 50 oz box like the other flavors. The 20 oz box at 8.99 is the same cost at the pet store (and it is 45 cents per ounce) versus a 50 oz box which is just 30 cents an ounce. The product is fantastic, though. A++++

review/summary: 4 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: Well the kind folks over at Wellness Pet Food heard about my website and sent me some treats to try! They ended up sending me a big box of their WellBars that have Yogurt, Apples, and Bananas in them. Totally vegetarian, oven baked with lots of vitamins! I'm sure you have read one of my other reviews about Old Mother Hubbard, they make outstanding healthy treats. Turns out that WellNess is owned by Old Mother Hubbard. Who knew? As usual Dad ran me though a barrage of tests to see how much I really wanted the treat. Let's just say I had to work very hard. Those silly "sit ups" that little dogs do, roll over, sit, stay, down, etc, just to have him put the treats in my Everlasting Treat Ball! I made short work of it and devoured my new delicious and healthy treats. The only thing I'm a little disappointed about is I found out that they have WellBites that are soft treats. They even have one that's Lamb and Salmon flavored... Those are two of my favorite things in the world. Now I have to talk Dad into buying them for me...<br /><br />Conclusion: Outstanding healthy dog treats! A must buy for a healthy pup.

review/summary: Buster Loves Yogurt and Apples
review/text: We can't change our dog's diet much.  Unfortunately he is highly food motivated and loves to visit our local hardware for treats.  In fact, he keeps a supply at the hardware.  He had never been diagnosed with any food allergies but after buying a large box of commercial treats to keep at the hardware, we started to notice some problems.<br /><br />A local pet store recommended another flavor of these treats.  He liked them but we didn't notice an improvement in his symptoms so I tried these.  After all, apples and yogurt are some of my boy's favorite things!<br /><br />He loves these treats.  Although his symptoms have not cleared up entirely, they did improve.  His friend at the hardware likes to feed him a lot of treats at once so we consider them well tested at this point and we just ordered our third box.  Dogs like 'em and mom approves!

review/text: Our dog will not eat the Wellness Wellbar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats; however, we crush two of these up for each daily feeding and mix them with his regular dog food.  For this reason I would not buy these crunchy treats again, although I must say they smell good!<br />We feel the reason for his not eating the crunchy treats is that he is accustomed to the soft Wellness wellbites that we have been giving him for over a year.  He loves these.<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002H3R2E">Wellness WellBar Yogurt, Apples and Bananas Dog Treats, 50-Ounce Pouch</a>

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

review/summary: Dishonest juice for your honest kid
review/text: This tastes terrible. The bland, watered-down taste appeals to neither kids nor adults. I found on the packaging that this is only 10% juice -- so 90% of what you are buying is water, hence the low calorie content.<br /><br />As a test, I poured this out into a glass and compared it to a glass of water. I expected to see a very clear liquid, but what I found was a bit more strange -- the actual color of the "Super Fruit Punch" flavor isn't pink or red as imagined on the package, but some sort of turbid yellow. You can guess what that looks like. See the picture I posted for a comparison on the product image page.<br /><br />I recommend looking elsewhere for better quality and value. Don't let the "100% Organic" marketing fool you -- these are no good.<br /><br />A much better solution: purchase a favorite drink and dilute it 50:50 with water for young children. Better yet, teach them juice is a special treat and water is for regular drinking.

review/summary: Buyer beware!
review/text: This is a great product and my kids love it but... Make sure you contact sellers before you buy it. I purchased under the assumption that I was getting 8 boxes of juice. I only received one box for $14.25 and sellers fees to return are outrageous not even worth returning! I can get these for $3.99 at my local grocery store which is why I jumped at the chance to pay less than $2/box. But it ended up being $2/pouch. I hope they specify better in the future but I doubt it they probably hope more people are dumb like me to make a huge profit. Please contact seller first and dont make same mistake I did.

review/summary: Excellent Gum!
review/text: I read a lot of negative reviews on this gum, but I think it's great.  The flavor is excellent and it last a long time, longer than most gums.  I am a huge fan of the Trident Splash gum, but the only flavor sold in stores in my area is the Strawberry with Lime, so it's nice to have a different flavor.  Yes, the price is high for gum, but I was willing to pay a higher price to get something I desired and it was worth the cost.

review/summary: TRIDENT SPLASH BERRY GREAT!
review/text: I chew sugarless gum all day long to help keep my mouth moist, because using supplemental oxygen makes my mouth very dry. Some of the medications that I take also cause a side effect of dry mouth. I have found all of the Trident Splash gums to be full of long lasting flavor, unlike regular Trident or Trident Layers. Trident Splash Pucker Me Berry has not been sold in any retail stores near me, so I decided to try ordering a wide variety of flavors of Trident Splash that I found on Amazon.com. I find the Berry Splash to be more refreshing & less sweet than the Strawberry Lime Splash. The other review of this product indicated that the flavor did not last. Trident Splash is made so that you experience an intense flavor burst when you open the liquid center; following that initial burst, there is a long lasting mild flavor. I hope you give it a try & enjoy!

review/summary: Best customer service ever and the quality is great!
review/text: Originally, I ordered the Italian Wedding Cookies from Amazon and received a case that was not up to my standards. I don't know if UPS had left them in the hot truck too long or what (maybe I'm just too picky), but they were not exactly as expected. I called the company and within two days had a brand new case (with a nice bonus) on the doorstep in perfect condition. The representatives for this company are beyond all doubt, extraordinary. Usually, Amazon is the first place I look for products that I cannot find locally or cheaply enough, but in this case, I would suggest ordering directly from Geraldines.

review/summary: the wine is decent
review/text: It makes a decent wine, this is made to drink when the wine is young, while the wine is just OK at a young stage, it says aging will cause it to lose the fruity taste but since it makes about 30 bottles I think there will be quite a few that will be left to age. I have made wine before and it has turned out well and tasted good after aging. This kit has the ingredients necessary to make the wine but you do need to have your own fermenting container, carboy, the air locks, bottles and things like that. It is easy to do and the price is reasonable. The quality of the wine isn't great but it is acceptable.

review/summary: Red Raspberry Pinot Nero *FANTASTIC*!
review/text: My Wife and I have been making wine from kits for about seven years now. This was our first Cornucopia Fruit Wine Kit. I think that my wife won't let me go back to our other brands now. The flavor of this wine is so incredibly Raspberry flavor, it's as if you are really biting into sweet juicy RED RASPBERRIES and the juice is running down your fingers and chin and the aftertaste you are left with is so pleasant on your tongue, you feel like you spent the day picking Raspberries and eating them as well. This kit was very easy to make. The only thing I did a little differently as far as bumping up the alcohol is I added about 2.5 lbs of corn sweetner (clear Karo) at the beginning of the fermenting. Just add it before the yeast. We have the Pear kit Fermenting now. And we just ordered a second kit of this Red Raspberry. We give a lot to friends and family and neighbors and they all want more more MORE!!!! lol. Well, we are looking forward to trying other flavors. My wife says to try the Red Currant for the holidays. And Green Apple at least. From all the reviews I read, it looks like there really isn't any flavor that is bad. So if your looking for an intense fruit flavor try this Red Raspberry Pinot Nero. You certainly will not be disappointed. Bet you can't drink just one glass!

Once word got out that I was experimenting, people were leaving skid-marks behind as they rushed over to my house.<br /><br />One of my closest pals even tried dipping his fist, but that resulted in a trip to the emergency room.<br /><br />It's not quite the same thing as making fudge - which I used to pack and ship off to friends (and even strangers) - but variety is the spice of life!

review/summary: So much better than Crystal Light
review/text: Since i'm on an eternal diet and don't want the extra calories of soda and juice this is a great alternative. I've been drinking this product for years. It is awesome. I prefer it so much more than Crystal Light. Since Crystal Light uses a different sweatener it leaves your mouth with a wierd "Sweet and Low" after taste. The 4C Totally Light 2 Go is made with "Splenda" not "Sweet and Low" so it tastes SOOOO much better. It's very difficult for me to find this product in Miami, FL so i'm forced to buy it online since none of my local grocery stores or Wallmarts carry this item. I wish they did carry it since it tends to be more expensive online. This is a great product though and very convenient to carry in your purse, wallet, keep in your drawer at work or at home.

review/text: This stuff tastes horrible!  And that includes the cranberry pomegranate as well.  It tastes like Kool Aid with extra chemicals--really nasty.  I'm going back to Crystal Light, even knowing that the Sucralose in Totally Light is healthier than the aspartame in Crystal Light.  Somehow, Totally Light should get some clue from Crystal Light to come up with a better taste and "mouth feel."  Totally Light is just chemical and watery tasting.

Recently I made the mistake of trying other brands. I will never do that again. I'm from the islands so I know the true quality of unrefined coconut oil. I promise Spectrums Unrefined coconut oil is honestly the best quality, texture, and organic scent. I will never venture out again.

review/summary: Salmon and Pinto Beans!  Who'dve thunkit?
review/text: We love cooking salmon on the grill on cedar planks (brown sugar and black pepper on top), but the planks are expensive and you have to soak them for an hour before you can use them... so I tried this grill-mate on a whim.  The results were just as good as the planks and with no prep time.<br />Today I was whipping up a batch of pinto beans in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009MGNO6">Fagor 2-by-1 Splendid 5-Piece Pressure Cooker Set</a>  I was thinking how nice it would be if I had a ham hock in the house, but I never do, so in goes the smokehouse seasoning with an onion and voila, the yummiest beans ever.<br />If you like smokey flavor this is a must in your spice-rack

review/text: This mix is good, but is a little sweet for my taste.  Most of the ingredient are sweet (yogurt covered raisins, cranberries, strawberries, glazed nuts, etc), with the exception of the peanuts, so it's a little overwhelming.  I wish the peanuts were salty, at least, to balance out the other ingredients.  Overall an okay mix, but definitely on the sweet side.

review/summary: An everyday, delicious jalapeno sauce
review/text: I must have a dozen or so of these little skulls floating around my house now.  Both my wife and I have them on our key chains.  And a few are hanging as trophies in our kitchen.<br /><br />Because we love "Blair's Jalapeno Death Sauce with Tequila."  It's really yummy, and has tons of flavor.  Look at that ingredient list: Fresh jalapeno, shallots, tomatillos, garlic, lime juice, agave tequila.  Yum, yum, yum.  I could go for some right now!<br /><br />And because this is only a jalapeno sauce, it really isn't all that spicy.  This is not one of those "Death" sauces that you parcel out a toothpick at a time and where a single bottle can last years. (Although I own quite a few of those as well!)  You can feel free to pour this sauce on in generous portions.<br /><br />I love this sauce on eggs.  On tacos.  On pretty much everything.  But probably my favorite use is to make some toast with butter, then slather this jalapeno sauce all over it for breakfast.  It's awesome!
