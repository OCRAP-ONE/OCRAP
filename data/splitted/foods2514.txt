review/text: I did not get to taste the worms, because when they got to me, the package was OPEN and worms were all out in the cardboard box! Gross! I returned them, but noticed that the plastic container they come in LOOKS like it has a seal on it, but if you try to open it on the opposite end, it opens. So, I didn't know if they were tampered with. I am very dissapointed!

review/summary: Good for cats - Loved by cats
review/text: Approximately 20 years ago, I began to exclusively feed our cats Iams or Science Diet.  Those brands were recommended by our Veterinarian after our first cat showed signs of Feline Urinary Syndrome (FUS).  I had previously fed the cats the typical brands such as 9 Lives, Purina and Friskies.<br /><br />I continued with IAMS and Science Diet, because the other brands caused FUS, caused other digestive problems and the good reputation of IAMS and Science Diet.<br /><br />Then last year, one of our cats developed bladder disease and died.<br /><br />Not long afterward, the pet food scandal broke. Cat and dog food from nearly every pet food company, including premium foods like IAMS and Science, were tainted by melamine.  More than 150 brands of cat and dog food were recalled.  IAMS and Science Diet were two of the recalled brands, as was natural sounding brands such as Nutro.<br /><br />I vowed to never again purchase pet food from the brands that had betrayed my trust.  I began searching for pet food that was all natural and organic.  Newman's Own is both natural and organic.  It was also one of the few brands not recalled. Although it was difficult to find a local source, I finally found a few, including Amazon.<br /><br />My cats love Newman's Own canned and dry food.  They also love Innova EVO.  I love it because I don't have to worry about tainted food poisoning my cats.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Peace of mind<br />2. Does not cause FUS, as did Purina and other similar brands<br />3. Much less likely to be tainted by lethal contaminants<br />4. The cats love it<br />5. Does not cause the other digestive problems.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It is more expensive than the non-premium brands<br />2. It can be difficult to find a nearby store that sells Newman's Own.<br /><br />Overall, the pros outweigh the cons.  And I can now add Amazon to my list of sources for the food.

review/summary: great cat food!
review/text: I bought Newman's Own after the cat chow scare as well but was surprised at the change in my cat's behavior and activity level within the first month of the switch. I wish it were available nearby but I'm signing up for the auto ship which gives you free shipping and a lower price. My cats love the flavor and respond well to the nutrition and absence of processing in their food. I know how lethargic I feel when I get busy and eat too much processed food-why would they react any differently? It's well worth the money-I've tried cat chow naturals and while it is better than regular it does not produce the level of improvement that PN does so I'm sticking with the good stuff!

review/summary: My cat actually loves it......
review/text: ...and he hates everything. I fed my cat Iam's for years, because his vet reccomended it and therefore I figured it must be the best for him, but after the cat food scare, I wanted to get out of all the traditional brands. The vet reccomended another brand, which I cannot think of the name right now... that you can buy at PetSmart. It was pretty pricey - about $28 for a 64 oz bag. My cat hated it, he refused to eat it, and it looked wooden.But I took him to a playdate at a friends and he has this habit of eating out everyone's bowl and came across Newman's Own in his friend's food bowl. He loved it! My friend sent me home with enough to transition him and I ordered a bag instantly from Amazon. And if you are looking to go organic with your kitty, comparatively, the price for Newman's Own is right. Much cheaper than those in the same class.

review/summary: Great for cats with corn allergies--meat #1 ingredient
review/text: I have 2 cats.  One is fluffy and finicky and won't eat anything but wet food and human meat.  The other one is athletic, lively and will eat only dried "crap" food.<br /><br />Well, the athletic one started having terrible eye problems (red and weepy) and she constantly scratched at them.  We tried oral Lysine, Terramycin antibiotics, and swapping out the plastic dish for ceramic.  Still she had eye problems.  So, guessing it might be a food allergy, I bought her Newman's because it doesn't have corn gluten, the primary ingredient of almost all dry cat foods. Newman's #1 and #2 ingredients are MEAT.<br /><br />She ate it immediately. Within 2 days her eye problems disappeared, so I am assuming she had developed allergies to the corn product in the dry food (and by the way, what felines eat corn in the wild?).<br /><br />But what really amazed me is that fluffy and finicky passed over her usual wet food and went right for the dry Newman's.  I just about wet my knickers!<br /><br />There you have it, 5 stars.

review/text: I purchased this food because I have 6 cats, and they were throwing up a lot.  I went from Purina, to Purina One to Whiskas to Iams and I knew there was something bad in the food.  After buying Newman's the throwing up stopped.  GOOD NEWS!  Except they don't like the food. I had 2 different flavors and they didn't like either one. I had a leftover bag of Iams and they broke into it.  I mixed it with Newmans and they picked it out.  I have now switched to California Natural and they don't throw up and they love the taste. I went to the natural pet store and got some free samples of different foods and my cats told me what they wanted.

review/summary: Good stuff, cat loves it.
review/text: I recently purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FK60LM">Petmate Le Bistro Portion-Control Automatic Pet Feeder, 5-Pound Capacity, Black</a> automatic cat feeder and I have been looking for a good large bag of organic dry food to fill it with. After reading some reviews about Newman's Own Organic pet food, and spending a few minutes on their website checking out the ingredients I was confident the quality was high.<br /><br />The bag is a great size for the 10lb automatic feeder, fills about half the tub. I have one medium sized cat so this lasts for a couple of months. I placed the cat food on subscription, using amazon prime, so I got it for a great price as well.<br /><br />My cat seems to be enjoying it and eating her two potions a day. I'm never quite sure what people mean when they say their cat won't eat the food. Perhaps I'm a little more stern with my cat, if she doesn't eat it, she doesn't eat. Trust me, sooner or later they will learn to love it. I think this policy has meant she is pretty good at trying new food and enjoying it.<br /><br />As much as I can review cat food without eating it, I'd say this is a good buy. I checked out the price of some bags of organic cat food at my supermarket and its competitively priced.

review/summary: My cats seem to love it.
review/text: I've got two cats.  One is about 8 years old, grey shorthair domestic, and very calm by nature.  The other is about 4 years old, abyssinian, and a loud pain in the butt by nature.<br /><br />I've been feeding them the Nutro for fat cats, and they eat it up, but never all at once.  I decided against IAMS a long time ago because of their issues with animal cruelty while doing their nutrition/diet tests on animals.<br /><br />Today I decided to buy them Newman's Own Adult Cat.  I didn't give them too much since it's not a weight control formula (which, frankly, both my cats need).  They both practically inhaled this stuff.  Later on the abyssinian even went back to lick the dish some more.<br /><br />After they ate it they both instantly became very calm and went to sleep.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye on how much they keep on liking this food.  If all goes well, I'll keep buying it despite the slightly higher price.  (The price at Whole Foods was similar to the price here on Amazon... where can I get this for the other price people have seen?  That's like half the price... are you guys sure you're getting the same size bags?)  But it's Newman's Own and they give money to animal charities, so that takes some edge off the price.<br /><br />My only wish is they also made a weight control cat food as well.

review/summary: Switched to Newman's Own Organic and all 3 cats stopped vomiting
review/text: Our three cats throw up every day and have been doing this for years. I am not talking about hairballs but vomiting up undigested food. The vet says they are very healthy but "cats do this".<br /><br />Last week we switched from "Purina One" to "Newman's Own Organics Adult Formula Dry Cat Food" and low and behold the vomiting completely stopped -OVERNIGHT!<br /><br />Prior to "Purina One - Urinary Track Health Formula" we fed them "Prescription Diet c/d" with the same vomiting.<br /><br />One caveat -the chicken in this Newman's Organic dry cat food is "Natural" and not "Organic" so I contacted Newman's Own to ask them what they feed their "Natural" chickens. We received a quick response from L.Phillips Brown, DVM, confirmed that even though they are not Organic chickens, they do NOT feed these free-range chickens GMO grains.<br /><br />We recently learned that since the mid-90s, food companies have been slipping GMOs into human and animal food, without our knowledge or approval, even though studies say these are quite harmful (causing damage to internal organs). The Europeans are smart enough to ban GMOs but not us "dumb Americans". So unless it is organic you are best to avoid all non-Organic meat, poultry, and "farm raised" fish (they are all fed GMOs) and non-Organic corn, soy, cottonseed, Canola products (these are GMO).<br /><br />Perhaps this cat food stopped the vomiting issue because Newman's Own has no GMOs or perhaps it is because there are no grains. In either event, it works. And this is nothing short of a miracle! We are astonished that the change was so immediate.<br /><br />All three cats love this food. The cats have not vomited once since we switched. Also, the cats seem calmer and their food cravings - to have their bowls constantly filled - have gone away.<br /><br />We really lucked on to something here. What a great cat food!

review/text: I rescued two cats, and the female cat had urinary infections...she had to be put on a very expensive prescription cat food. When the manfacturer quit making the food, I had to search for another food, and every one of them gave her problems. I tried one prescription that made both her and the healthy male sick. I never even knew Paul Newman had cat food. Well, since I have put both cats on Paul's cat food, it has been wonderful. She is healthy now, and we aren't taking her to the vet frequently, as we were before. Our little male cat, Boots, has a shinier coat now too, which the vet noticed when he got his yearly shots. I highly recommend this food.<br /><br />Sadly, Paul and Joanne are now deceased. I admired them both. All of the money from their products went to charity. Yes, 100 per-cent. I don't know if things will continue the same when both Paul and Joanne were alive, but hopefully it will.

This food uses human grade natural chicken (no hormones, antibiotics, pesticides) in both their canned and dry food.<br /><br />I wish this listing had the Nutrition Facts, but if you go to newmansownorganics dot com and read the FAQs you will learn a great deal about pet nutrition.

We simply leave food out for him at all times, and this food makes up 99% of his diet (outside of a few bites of bacon here and there).  Once he reached adulthood, his weight has not varied more than a few ounces either way from a very healthy (for his overall size) 10lbs.  Our vet says that the long-term maintenance of a healthy weight is one of the surest signs of a good diet in adult cats.  He has a VERY healthy and shiny looking coat, is very energetic, and has very few gastrointestinal issues.  Plus, you get the added bonus of all the good the Newman's Own Foundation does.  Couldn't be happier!!

review/summary: Saved a lot of $$$ at the vet--be patient, though, it might take some time!
review/text: I bought this food based upon other reviews from people who said that it helped their cats who had been licking off their fur. For a long time our cat had been licking the fur off of her back legs. The vet said it was possibly an allergy and that we could spend all the money for allergy testing but might not find anything. She also said that we could consider giving the cat Benadryl to see if that helped (but didn't necessarily see the need to do either at that point).<br /><br />Eventually, though, the cat got to the point where she was pretty much licking off all of the fur she could reach--we literally had a half naked cat! She also had lots of small "scabs" (which she'd gotten before, but not to this extent), which was probably at least partly why she was licking the fur off. We figured the vet, if she saw the cat at that point, would recommend allergy testing. I decided to give this food a try first.<br /><br />I'm very happy to report that it worked! Some other reviewers said that it worked for their cats in a couple of weeks. With our cat it took at least 4-6 weeks. At this point she's grown all of her fur back and the scabs are gone, too.<br /><br />And she has loved the food from the very beginning--no problems eating it (as at least one reviewer mentioned), even though it is in very small pieces.<br /><br />So if your cat is licking off his or her fur, consider trying this before spending all of the money for allergy testing (unless, of course, your cat is having other medical issues, too, that you're worried about). Great stuff!

review/summary: Your Cat Deserves This Food
review/text: I've been feeding my six cats Newman's Own organic food for years. Their coats are sleek and healthy. They are healthy. This is certified organic food, not that phony 'all natural' stuff. Terms like 'all natural' and 'human quality' are meaningless. Take a look at what is in regular pet food--google '4 D meat.'<br />This is the one food I really trust.

review/summary: Yummy food that fills the feline belly...
review/text: Our two 7 y/o female Scotish-Fold Ear and 5 y/o male Selkirk Rex really seem to love this food. They all have sensitive stomachs, and can get diarrhea quite easily, but this food has never caused them any distress. They get dry food cafeteria style and, while they really like this food, the bowl contents don't evaporate as quickly...it must be more filling than other brands they've eaten. Moreover, the two girls harvested the hair on their bellies for years...the vet told us they were neurotic...within days of starting Newmans Dry Cat Food they stopped chewing at their stomachs. This food is hard to find locally now, and I'm glad, as I would have never discovered Amazon had it available for subscription at a fair price. Our cat masters and I thank you!

The one the does eat dry cat food though - who seemingly will eat any dry food wouldn't eat this one and I ended up donating it to a local cat rescue center hoping that it would at least feed some cat somewhere.<br /><br />I need to emphasize that my cat is not a fussy eater by anyone's standard and that she would not consume this says something about the product. So I guess it doesn't matter how healthy it may be if your animal won't consume it.

review/summary: Kitty does not like it...
review/text: What a wonderful thought that Newman's Own makes cat food. Organic cat food. I would love to support this product and feed it to my big fluffy girl... she's really not a kitty anymore, and she's usually not picky with her dry food. However, she hates this food and literally turns her nose up at it. I've tried fooling her by mixing it in with her other dry food... since I had to go out and buy a bag of her old stuff, that is. She's good at leaving this stuff in the bowl and sorting out the food she likes. So I am about to toss this food in the garbage, and I hate to waste food. I wonder if there are too many veggies in this food? Cats and dogs are carnivores after all. Carrots and oats and peas are not really good for them. I'm at my computer right now, away from the ingredients list, but I recall this food is heavy on the veggie, non-meat ingredients. Sadly, I will not be buying this great-sounding product again. I think it would benefit from some steak juice at least... or some really stinky fish bi-product.

review/summary: Cats Won't Eat It.
review/text: Did the company that makes this product bother offering it to cats first to see if they would even eat it?  My cat won't eat it.  Pixie gives it two paws down. I tried offering it to the starving feral cats outside, and they won't eat it either.  I bought two bags of it for nothing.  My cat actually did try it once, and promptly threw up.  No fur balls came up any time after that, either, so I know she wasn't sick at the time.  She still refuses to eat any more of it.  It might be great from both nutritional analysis and organic points of view, but it's not any good if cats won't actually want to eat it.  I'm going back to Purina when I feed kibbles to the cat because I know from information that I've seen on TV that Purina actually taste-tests their products.  My same cat will eat the Newman's Own canned cat food with the same degree of enthusiasm that she eats Purina, but the same is not true for the kibble.

Some stores don't even carry toasted sesame oil at all.  It's still a little pricey here but cheaper than some of the small bottles carried locally.  I tried another brand on here and was disappointed to find it wasn't toasted so it had almost no flavor at all.  This oil adds a delicious strong toasted sesame flavor to stir fry or salads.  A little goes a long way.

review/summary: Fantastic flavor and fragrance and great for bagging bears too!
review/text: This dark sesame oil does wonders for any application that calls for sesame oil. Keep it in the fridge for longevity so it doesnt go rancid on you and you will be very happy with its performance. It has a wonderful fragrance and provides a deep sesame flavor to any dish you apply it to. I add it to my bread machine when i make a loaf because the sesame adds wonderful flavor without the mess of seeds.<br />You should note that when you keep it in the fridge the viscosity thickens and it pours slower. I have used this for a long time now and do not need to try other brands as this is fine. Unfortunately my order arrived damaged and the oil leaked everywhere. In fact this oil is so fragrant a bear braved the spotlights in front of my home to get to the box with the broken bottles. That never happened before! I didnt bother to ask the bear what it thought of the oil either.&#128516;<br /> Unless you are going to be using alot consider buying one bottle at a time so your supply will be fresher. This is a key ingredient for most asian dishes and is a worthy addition to your pantry if you do asian dishes.&#128077;

review/summary: Shipping fiasco for FedEx Smart Post and Amazon
review/text: I placed my order on 6 Feb and received it in USPS mail 17 Feb, shipped from JVS in California.  I recommend future customers outside of California to order from uR Asian vendor due to the location of JVS.  I cannot imagine it takes three days to reach a major shipping hub in Washington state, as JVS required.<br /><br />Amazon product page identifies product takes one or two days longer to process this product, then they should factor that information into their created arrival period windows.<br /><br />After Amazon's original arrival window failed I contacted them and they created a new arrival window...both windows were completely flawed.  The product arrived two days after the second window expired.<br /><br />Amazon states to not rely on tracking information unless you order directly from Amazon.  Fine, then Amazon can explain why they provided two false arrival periods.  I mean they didn't rely on flawed information from FedEx to create these windows, did they?<br /><br />FedEx Smart Post provided incorrect tracking information, citing my post office received the package.  Once Amazon contacted FedEx, they corrected their information, but Amazon did not update and provide a third correct arrival window.<br /><br />The product is in glass bottles.  The color is darker than pictured.  I find no fault with the taste.  In fact, compared to most grocery chain products, this oil has a cleaner flavor...less over toasting of seeds, while being rich in flavor.  I consider this a positive addition to my pantry, deserving five stars.

review/text: Several companies now have products called Chicken Poppers.  However, what I like about these is that they aren't at all greasy.  I have to be careful what I give my dogs because one gets Pancreatitis very easily and the other is a little piggy so I have to watch how much he eats.  These are a great size to satisfy without overdoing it.  And they are especially crunchy so the pups really enjoy them.  I'm sure they taste quite good as well, considering how quickly the little popper disappears.

review/summary: Best tasting sugar free energy drink I can get in an 8 oz can
review/text: It may be the best tasting energy drink I can get in an 8 oz can from Amazon, but that isn't saying too much. I really LOVE the Hansen's non-diet lemon lime energy drink ("Hansen's Energy Pro"), which is very mild and delicious. This tastes more like sweeteners. Too bad they can't rejigger the non-Diet flavor into something good.<br /><br />When I compare it to the other small format energy drinks, it's much less cloying and much more tolerable. I actually like it. Compared to diet Red Bull, this tastes a little less toxic. And it's much less toxic tasting than Liquid Ice Sugar Free. So far, this is my favorite sugar free energy drink. I'll keep an Amazon subscription for Hansen's Diet Red until I get an Espresso machine. But at least with Diet Red, I don't have to worry about yellow teeth.

review/summary: a great tasting snack (small meal) substitute
review/text: If you're a former junk food junkie like me, then you'll get an idea of what these things taste like when I describe them as a more fibrous (chewy) version of rice kripy squares with a chocolate coating on the bottom.  They really are that delicious.  And at 170 calories with 4gm of fat (1.5gm saturated), 9gm of protein, and 5gm of fiber, they are a healthy alternative to many other types of snacks that one could indulge in (pastries, candy, etc).<br /><br />These are easily my favorite protein bar and I've tried over a dozen kinds.<br /><br />Edit on 9/27/07:  This review pertains to the chocolate peanut Go Lean flavor.  I just noticed that Amazon is grouping reviews for all of Kashi's bars together, so without specificity in the review it's impossible to know which product is being reviewed.

review/text: This is one of the best nutrition bars I have ever eaten.  As another reviewer stated, it is like a rice krispy treat.  However, dare I say, this bar is better-tasting than a rice krispy treat.  It's made with rice, oats, nuts, sugar cane juice, and a chocolate underbelly.  The bar is good for a quick snack if you're hungry between meals, and if you divide your meals up to five a day, then it's basically a meal.  Each bar has 6 grams of fiber and 9 grams of protien, so it will help fill you up more than that junky Snickers.  They're a little on the expensive side, but it's worth it.

review/text: I just submitted a review of the Chocolate Peanut Bliss bar, a product I've been enjoying regularly for the past couple of months.  This bar is very similar to the other flavor in terms of nutritional information as well as consistency, but I don't like this one quite as much.  To me the "caramel" flavor in this bar does not much resemble caramel and actually has a bit of a malty flavor.  I do enjoy these on occasion for variety, though, and obviously some other reviewers liked the flavor of these more than I did.

With 27g of Carbs, 8g of protein they fit the 3:1 carb: protein ratio for post-runs, plus they have 5g of fiber to boot.  More importantly, they taste great!  I've tried other 'energy bar' type things, i.e. larabar, but can't stand the dense, moist, chewy texture. These are more in line with the texture of a Kashi granola bar.  Surprisingly they are cheaper ($13.99/box or $1.19/bar) at Wegmans.

review/summary: Tasty but high price!
review/text: These bars are extremely tasty and can substitute a mini meal. They seem to slightly overpriced considering the size of the bars. I switched to Nature Valley granola bars for my daily snack, but would consider having the Kashi bars in between for a change.

review/summary: Good Snack Bar
review/text: I didn't like this as much as the Chocolate Almond bar, but it was still very good. The peanut flavor blended well with the chocolate and really supressed my hunger for those snack times. Sits very well a little while before a run or hard workout.

review/summary: True it it's name
review/text: This nutrition bar has a good mix of fat, carbs and protein without being large (at 1.5oz as opposed to many bars that are larger). It is a small snack instead of a mini-meal and tasty.

review/summary: THESE BARS ARE SIMPLY THE BEST!!!
review/text: Love the flavor, texture and overall yumminess of these bars.  I never knew what to have at snack time and would reach for a couple cookies or a few pieces of candy.  Then the guilt...now, having these bars has satisfied my sweets cravings with no feelings of having behaved badly :)  Since I am trying to lose a few pounds, I'll try these bars at snacktime alternating with popcorn and maybe a peach.  Nice to know there are healthy alternatives when the craving for a between meal nibble attacks!

review/summary: Kashi Go Lean Crunchy Chocolate Almond
review/text: This was an ok bar.  Not my favorite of the Kashi line-up, but still not bad in a pinch when I have nothing else for breakfast.<br /><br />The chocolate almond bar tasted mainly of chocolate.  In fact, I really didn't taste the almonds at all.  I'm sure they added to the crunchy texture, but predominately I tasted the other grains in there all liberally coated with a milk chocolate.  This was made even more chocolatey by the thick coating on the bottom as well.  So all in all, definitely chocolate if you couldn't tell from the description thus far.  I do enjoy the crunchy aspects of this particular type of bar as well, but compared to the Chocolate Pretzel and some of the other ones, I don't think it was quite as crunchy as it could have been.<br /><br />These are definitely a fitness bar.  8 grams of protein, 5 grams of fiber, and 170 calories are packed right in.  This makes it the perfect choice for exercise or as a meal replacement.  I wouldn't recommend just snacking on it when you're hungry.  Choose a lower calorie snack for that type of meal.  Sugars are 13 grams, which isn't high, but it isn't the diabetic special either.<br /><br />Ingredients are alright.  It doesn't boast the organic ingredients that some bars too, but it does have that Kashi special seven whole grains ingredient in it.  The main sweetener is brown rice syrup and there is some evaporated cane juice crystals and fructose as well.  They also add some vitamins such as folic acid and zinc oxide into the blend too.  And of course there are almonds in this bar, so those with nut allergies should probably steer clear.<br /><br />Not a bad bar but I'd choose other flavors over this one.  There just wasn't anything special or unique seeming about it.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012

review/text: Convenient and delicious, just like other Kashi GoLean Crunch bars.  The caramel popcorn flavor is tasty and unique and I think has the best nutrition stats for weight loss of all the flavors.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Kashi products in general and these are super tasty! Fiber and protein balanced which makes me feel full and satisfied, no sugar crash.  Even my 8 year old LOVES them.  I like the convenience of being able to pack these for daily outtings or family trips.  Amazon pricing is super!
