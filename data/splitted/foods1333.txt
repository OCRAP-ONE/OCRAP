review/summary: Not the original recipe since 2007
review/text: Sometime in 2007 they changed to recipe. I used to have a pack a day habit until this new substitute came out. Strange tasting stuff. I have heard some stores have discontinued it due too poor sales. Too bad, I would buy boxes of it and hide it under my bed. They need to follow Coke and come out with Classic Chocolate Twizzers. When something is good why change it ?

review/text: My family and I have a passion for chocolate Twizzlers.  The problem was that none of our local stores were carrying it any more.  Believe me I will tell you I searched high and low.  I tried Amazon as a last ditch effort and low and behold, not only did Amazon carry it, but I could get it delivered on a reoccuring order.  At first I worried that the product wouldn't be fresh, but after my first delivery I became a believer.  Now we can get our chocolate Twizzer fix monthly.  Thank you Amazon.

review/summary: NOT 100% ITALIAN OLIVES
review/text: When I bought this 2 pack of Colavita 101 oz tins, I assumed I would be getting 100 EVO Italian oil, as is printed on the smaller 34 oz tins Amazon also sells.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLB16">Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2)</a>  I had bought the smaller size in my local supermarket, LOVED the peppery flavor, and thought, "I'm diggin this oil so much, I'll save money and get the larger sizes from Amazon, and laugh every time I see the outrageous prices I would be shelling out at my local market".  Wouldn't you know, the larger size is a BLEND--says it so on one of the sides.  A blend of Italian, Spanish and Greek olives.  Goodbye peppery flavor!  This oil is bland compared to the smaller Colavita.  A good oil, nonetheless, better for dressings than dipping---but nowhere near the character of Colavita's 34 ozzer

review/text: BEWARE- The items advertised are not what they ship. The item pictured is indeed Colavita Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil. The item is described as " Italian Extra Virgin Olive Oil... it is the natural juice squeezed from Italian olives ... COLAVITA guarantees its product to be 100% Italian olive oil and properly labeled. A true Italian."<br /><br />However, the item shipped is NOT Italian. It is a blend of Mediterranean olives and is inferior to what they claim they are selling. If you're not looking specifically for higher quality oil, then this is for you, but don't buy it at this price.

review/text: I was leery about buying 25 lbs. of flour but after reading the other review decided to try it.  I can definitely give it 5 stars.  Yesterday I ordered another bag of it.  The price from Amazon, which includes shipping, is so much better than buying in bulk in the health food stores .  It comes neatly packaged in a cardboard box and the actual flour sack easily opens with the tab top. As soon as I received it, I portioned it into resealable bags and put them in the freezer, refrigerator, and pantry so there wouldn't be a bug issue.

review/summary: Love this flour
review/text: I have really enjoyed this flour. It has an even finer grind than Bob's Redmill brand. It has an awesome flavor and works great for quickbreads, muffins, pancakes and other "batter" type items. I haven't figured out how to make a shaped loaf of bread with it very well yet, but I hold out hope there is a way. The lower gluten has made it easier for me to digest and I think the pros outweigh the cons. I hope they continue to offer it at a competative price for a long time.

If you never used Spelt flour before, I suggest buying a small amount to try and search the internet for recipes.

review/text: I'm not a big Folgers fan, but got this for my Folgers loving Dad for christmas. I LOVE this one, it dosen't taste cheap, it tastes VERY good. I'm normally a "milk and sugar with a little bit a coffee" when it comes to drinking folgers but this dosen't need much extras. Its also not one of those flavored coffees that you get sick of after 1 cup.

review/text: The directions tell you to only use these beans for your coffee. That's not necessary. I, myself, use regular beans and just a single teaspoon of Folgers on top and the end result is unbelievable.<br />I also recommend you keep your open bag in the refrigerator and the closed ones in your freezer, in order to keep them fresh.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I have been drinking powdered cocoa for nearly 40 years.  I consider myself pretty familiar with the powdered/add water-type cocoas and most of them taste like sand.  They are gritty and are either too sweet or far too bitter or have no real flavor at all (and stay in a thick lump at the bottom of the mug no matter how much you stir with a spoon).<br /><br />In nearly 40 years, I have only found two brands of cocoa that did not taste like gritty sludge (e.g., Swiss Miss, Carnation, Nestle's).  One powdered cocoa is from the LDS Church and it's almost impossible to get in Kentucky.  The Distribution Center is in Indianapolis and none of the wards here seem to have anyone who holds the calling of Preparation Specialist; therefore, no one goes to Indy very often.  The second great cocoa was made by Cold Stone Creamery.  It was sold through Walmart and was as smooth as the Church cocoa.  Unfortunately, Walmart no longer stocks it.  I'm not sure it's even manufactured any more.<br /><br />Yesterday I ran across Stevens Cocoa.  It was on the shelf for $1.00 (that's right -- a measly buck) so I decided to try it.  I knew that if I didn't like it, I could take it to work and give it away.<br /><br />I'm in love.<br /><br />This stuff is equally as good as the cocoa from the LDS Church and Cold Stone Creamery.  One sip and I was hooked. It dissolves well, it's not overly sweet, it has a nice mild flavor and it's just downright good.  I top it with Redi-Whip for fun but it doesn't need it, it's good without any help.<br /><br />I'm headed back to stock up on more cans.  If it disappears from the shelves in a couple of weeks, it's nice to know I can get it from Amazon.  I never thought I'd fall in love with a product enough to buy it from Amazon when the supply dried up on the shelves but I'm making an exception for this cocoa.  It's worth it.

review/text: I love hot chocolate, but I am rather picky.  I don't like sugar water flavored with chocolate and drinking this reminds me of just that.  I had one cup and never drank the rest of the container.  I honestly felt lied to because the word "gourmet" is on the package.  This hot chocolate mix is not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination.  Even a basic Swiss Miss packet would be a better choice and that's saying a lot.

I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.

review/summary: NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!
review/text: As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for "alive and aware raw cacao" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say "out of stock" or "currently unavailable" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the "brands" and "vendors" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said "alive and aware" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food "of the Gods" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!

I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.

review/summary: Equidorian OJio Arriba Carillo "RAW Oranic" Cacao
review/text: Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.

review/text: This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.

review/summary: Maybe the Best You'll Ever Have!
review/text: *****<br />I really enjoy Numi's Berry Black Fruitea Darjeeling Black Tea, because unlike most berry teas, I taste the black tea and the Darjeeling far more intensely than the berries...the berries are more like overtones and definitely not overwhelming, creating what I think is a more adult berry black tea. The flavors of this tea are thankfully complex.<br /><br />Berry Black is certified organic and contains fair trade certified organic Darjeeling black tea, organic hibiscus, organic freeze-dried strawberries, organic freeze-dried raspberries, organic rosehips, and organic raspberry leaf. There are no oils or natural flavorings used, unlike many berry teas. It is also kosher. This tea is sustainable in that all packaging materials are biodegradable and recyclable, the carton is made of 100% post-consumer waste, and cello wrap is not used. Numi says that all their tea bags "are made of natural fiber paper, not the trendy, "silky" see-though nylon tea bags". The reason it is called "full leaf" is that Numi black teas do not contain tea dust or fannings, which tend to make tea taste bitter; instead, they contain the full leaf, expanding when they are brewed, "releasing a robust and long lasting experience".<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Extraordinary and the first of its kind, Numi's organic Berry Black features real North American forest fruits, not artificial or natural flavorings, to create an authentic berry taste. Our luscious strawberries and raspberries are freeze-dried at the peak of ripeness to retain their true flavor. This sassy, organic tea is fresh, wild, and all natural, blending hibiscus, Vitamin C-loaded rosehips, and a touch of smooth organic Darjeeling. Grown in the high mountains of India, Numi's special Darjeeling adds a floral balance as it captures the depth of black tea. Discover the berried treasure in each cup - you'll be hooked!"<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love Darjeeling tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

With other brands I have tried, while they have been very flavorful, it was difficult to unwrap them without playing tug of war with the wrapping. These are wrapped in powdered parchment and then an outer wrapper, easy to remove and pop in your mouth. And the Amazon 5-pack price cannot be beat. I paid over twice this price in a local health food store. Stock up - they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: Rancid and hugely overpriced
review/text: This product -eg the 35 lb bag- just DOUBLED in price, from 35 to 63$ for a 35lbs bag. Strangely the price for the 17 lb bag has remained unchanged..<br /><br />Delivery was prompt (prime), but on opening the bag the rancid smell was overwhelming. Granted it is still summer, but this bag must have been in a warehouse storage for some time.<br /><br />Aside from the rancid smell, it looked as advertised, small kibble without coloring, ingredients said to be all from the US.<br /><br />However, there is no justification to grossly overcharge for it.<br /><br />I will not reorder for that reason. And because the heavy rancidity of this product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Hi-Tek-Naturals-Chicken-Formula-35-Pound/dp/B004TMGRLG/ref=sr_1_2?s=pet-<br />supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1348333106&sr=1-2&keywords=hi+tek+dog+food

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I am so glad Amazon had our brand! After our distributor went out of business, I couldn't find Hi-Tek anywhere! We switched our two Cattle dog mixes to Hi-Tek from Blue Buffalo after it made our 9-year-old gassy. This food is all natural and made in America (even the packaging is made in the USA) and I can get a huge bag of Hi-Tek for $20 less than other natural brands in the pet store with Amazon's free shipping. When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!<br /><br />I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek! Natural food on a budget.

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.

review/text: I bought this for a friend who loves Zhena's Lucious Lemon but wanted a change.  This tea is delicious but it is a grassy, herby kind of taste. It reminds me of the golden rolling hills of Calif.in the autumn; it just brought back that dry grass in the air feeling. NOT to say it is not flavorful but the lemon does not predominate as it does in the Luscious Lemon.  It is more herby than fruity and has a light slightly sweet aftertaste.<br />VERY refreshing. Go for it!

review/summary: Not like the tea it replaced but a nice tea.
review/text: I had first been introduced to the Zhena Gypsy tea when I bought some loose tea at our local Wegman's.  Wegman's called it Winter Morning Tea.  It was a lemon rooibos tea and had a great deal of large lemongrass pieces in it.  It had a very strong lemongrass flavor.  I loved it and was disappointed when Wegman's stopped carrying it so they finally revealed their source for the tea -- Zhenas Gypsy Tea.  I contacted them and they sold me a large bag of their lemon rooibos tea-- which was exactly the same as the tea I had been buying at Wegman's.  It took quite a while to use up the large bag, but when I finally did and went to reorder, I got this tea.  It is a very nice tea but it is not the same as that original Winter Morning tea.  It does not have the large pieces of lemongrass and has a much less lemon and more rooibos flavor.  It is a lovely tea but it is just not what I was expecting and hoping for.

review/summary: As close to the Original Version as We've Seen Yet
review/text: After rallying against the Cafe Francais in the beige can (that was too salty & sweet) - I found this new one - in a red, white and violet tin at a Walmart. I have saved one old tin of most versions so here's the run down<br /><br />Earliest original recipe: "General Foods International Cafe Francais: French Style Flavored Instant Coffee" has the universal 60 cal. per serving plus Total fat 3.5g , Saturated Fat 1 g, Sodium 95mg, Total Carb 7g, Sugars 4g - that one is from YEARS ago. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor. No mention of Maxwell House on the front label. 8 oz.<br /><br />Recent tin before they really ruined things and it was still in a red white and blue tin: "General Foods International Cafe Francais: Coffee Drink Mix" Total fat 3g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0,  Sodium 90mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 5g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, MALTODEXTRIN, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor. 8 oz.<br /><br />Yucky beige tin called "Maxwell International Cafe: Cafe Francais: Cafe-Style Bevarage Mix":  Total fat 2.5g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0,  Sodium 95mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 6g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor, ARTIFICIAL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE. 8 oz<br /><br />Newest red, violet & white tin, pictured here is called: "General Foods International from the makers of Maxwell House:  Cafe Francais: Coffee House Bevarage Mix": Total fat 3g , Saturated Fat 2.5g, Trans Fat 0,  Sodium 90mg, Total Carb 8g, Sugars 5g. Ingredients: non dairy creamer, sugar, instant coffee, MALTODEXTRIN, sodium citrate, less than 2% artificial and natural flavor, ARTIFICIAL COLOR, SILICON DIOXIDE. 7.6 oz!<br /><br />For some reason this new flavor is not as sharp/non sweet as the original recipe but I accept it and suspect that it's the closest we are going to get to our much loved original recipe. I hope that we go back to the very first original recipe with the least saturated fat. That one tasted the best!! Buy this one for now and let's petition GFI/Maxwell house to go way back to the original!!<br /><br /> I hope this info helps you!

So I give it 5 stars because I love it, but if I could give it -5 stars for their packaging/pricing gimmick thinking we won't notice, I would.

review/text: I ordered this product online because I take 8 ounces everyday; 4 oz. in the morning and 4 oz. in the evening.  I usually bought it locally but you could only get a 32 oz. bottle.  I thought I would try this 128 oz. and the price was about the same.  The only thing I can say about the larger size is that it seemed to be diluted and have somewhat of a bitter taste.  The local product was thicker and didn't taste bitter.  I probably won't order it again because the first ingredient in the product was water? So to me the product can't be 100% Goji juice?

review/summary: Always The Best Cat Food
review/text: Is there anything one can add to the accolades for Fancy Feast?  It is the caviar of cat foods . . . always reliably good and no cat can resist it.  This particular selection has lots of gravy, and kitties just love that . . . feels great to know that one's dearest fur family member is getting nutrition as well as a meal . . . all the vitamins and minerals that a kitty needs . . . and my vet confirmed that a cat can get fat on eating only dry food, so this moist and tender canned food is good to offer the kitty, as well.  Humans would not want to eat only dry cereal or bread every day for every meal, and mewers need tasty morsels, as well.  Have used this for thirty years and raised cats into their twenties with it . . . always happy, contented, and they never want to go after the human food if they have been fed their Fancy Feast! Is whisker-licking good--thousands of cats can't be wrong!

review/summary: My slim-down drink of choice.
review/text: I've spent a lot of years drinking diet drinks, and while I did get in better shape by cutting out the sugar, I realized something: Carbonated diet drinks tend to make my stomach burn, which feels very similar to hunger. After converting to drinking this, I'm finding it a lot easier to avoid snacking and the drink doesn't make me feel like reaching for more snacks.<br /><br />I've had other diet green teas, and if you've had Lipton with lemon, this is entirely different. Calorie free and a slight honey taste, it's made with Splenda and don't have the high acidity or aftertaste that I've had with other diet green teas. It doesn't taste like regular tea, but it doesn't have the telltale green tea taste that some others do have.<br /><br />I drink this stuff and it helps satiate my thirst and curb my hunger.  Problem solved.

review/summary: A most excellent soda!!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />I've tried most flavors of Ramune before, but I had never tried the lychee flavor until I brought some home this past Christmas. The lychee flavor is really difficult to describe. It's sort of like a cross between strawberry and pear, but there is really no Western analog to the taste. You just have to try it for yourself and judge.<br /><br />It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: I've tried one other type of Ramune before, Sangaria, and I really didn't care for it. This, on the other hand, wasn't bad at all. The bottle itself is very fun to open and the taste is comparable to a lemon/lime flavor mixed with strawberry. Judging from the bottle itself, a "lychee" is some sort of fruit. I had previously never heard of it, but now I want to try that too. So yeah, check it out. If you don't like the drink itself, you won't be disappointed with the cool bottle and opening design.

The bottle has a little ball that drops down into it and catches carbonation bubbles. I have no idea why its there but its cool! My only guess is that it is there to either control flow of intake or just because it is unique. Either way... Awesome!

review/text: This is by far the yummiest maple syrup we have ever tried...and we have tried many! I'm having trouble keeping my husband from over-dosing on the stuff! You can order without worry and be assured of a great product.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: This is a really nice, rich tasting maple syrup. Those new to maple syrup should try the B grade because it has more authentic flavor and is thicker than the lighter grades. Goes farther on pancakes and in recipes, too.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: Wow! This really hurts me to do this, but I have to give this syrup the lowest review it has gotten yet. This was my first time ordering  Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup, and I did so because the other brands weren't available in the 1 Half Gallon variety. I wanted to go with 1 Half Gallon this time because I go through the 32 oz. containers too quick and the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup also saved me money by buying it in bulk. Now to the bad part, I usually purchase either the Coombs Family Farms or Highland Sugarworks brands of maple syrup and I love their taste; it was a bitter disappointment when I first tasted the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup and realized I'd made a huge mistake.<br /><br />I do not cook with these syrups, I use them for one thing and one thing only -- pancakes, waffles, or French-Toast. The aforementioned brands I usually purchase are awesome on my breakfast products, but the Hidden Springs Maple Syrup had a very funny off-putting taste that made it impossible to enjoy my breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat. Perhaps it'll make a good cooking syrup and I can find some good recipes calling for maple syrup. But in summation, if you're going to spend this much money on maple syrup, buy Coombs or Highlands, there's a reason they are the top purchased syrups on Amazon.

review/summary: Good product, good quality.
review/text: Thought I'd take a chance on this, as my grocery store does not know about maple syrup grades (light amber is best).  Price is beautiful -- grocery store charged as much for two 8-ounce bottles as this whole quart.  Shipping time was amazing -- super saver in 1.5 days -- and yum!  Reminded me that it's been years since I bought a 3-pound box of maple sugar candy...  Time to search again... &lt;grin><br />Forgor to mention -- definitely grade "A" Fancy -- not grade "B" (the cooking grade).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HI556E">Hidden Springs Maple Vermont Maple Syrup, 1 Quart - Fancy Grade - Light Amber</a>

review/summary: Can I give it 10 STARS?
review/text: Hidden Springs Vermont Maple Syrup is excellent!  There isn't anything on the label that states that this is from anywhere else but Vermont...(some syrups that claim to be pure maple syrup also have labels that state that they may be a product of Canada or Vermont).  The price per oz. is about 81 cents and as I use at least one ounce on my waffles, this bottle will last for about 16 servings.  I will be buying this one again!
