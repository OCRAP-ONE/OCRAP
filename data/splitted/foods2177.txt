review/summary: a cookie?
review/text: This item is not like any cookie I've ever met.  I am not sure what to call it.  It's large, 3 oz. and 300 calories.  It looks like a thick patty.  It is dense and chewy.  I bought the double chocolate chunk flavor.  It has a mild cocoa flavor with notes of prune and bitter coffee. It is only slightly sweet, and has a hint of medicinal quality.  Though listed in the ingredients, I could not find a single chocolate chunk that was large enough to differentiate from the rest of the heavy, soft patty.  Most of the doughy thing is chewable but there are small grains of something that are distinctly harder and got caught in the cusps of my molars.<br /><br />If you are too busy to enjoy your food or can't taste anything anyway, maybe these are for you.  For me, when I spend 300 calories, even on the run, I want something that makes my mouth happy.  Half a whole wheat English muffin, a tablespoon of natural peanut butter, half a banana sliced on top.  All around better! And no messier to eat because these patties are crumbly and a slightly sticky.  You'll have bits on your upholstry and traces on the steering wheel.<br /><br />Reformulate, Erin!  Food should be a healthy PLEASURE.

review/text: I received some cookies that were not so fresh from Amazon. I talked to a rep at Erins Bakery and they were great! They stand behind their products and made sure I was a satisfied customer. I have loved these cookies (as well as the oatmeal raisin, morning glory, and mocha cappuccino flavors) for a long time and will continue to support this customer oriented company. These are delicious cookies and have really helped me lose 25lbs after having my baby.

review/summary: Gooey Chocolate Chips!
review/text: My husband and I have tried to change our eating habits this year and part of that has been making sure we have something for breakfast.  I don't know about everyone else, but we are not friends with our alarm clock.  We have a slap fight every morning with it until we realize we must obey if we want to keep our jobs.  Needless to say, there is no time for breakfast before we rush out the door.<br /><br />This is where these cookies come in very handy.  The first time we bought them we kept them in our pantry (I think we bought 60 that time to try a variety of flavors).  Unfortunately, by the time we reached the last dozen, they had gone bad and were a bit fuzzy.  Now this is actually a good thing!  Mold can't grow without moisture, so this tells you the cookies are moist!  Because they are all natural and are not made with preservatives, it is only reasonable that they would have a shorter shelf life.<br /><br />Next order we popped a weeks worth in the fridge and put the rest in the freezer.  We did this because my husband likes to eat them in morning traffic on his way to work so frozen cookies wouldn't work for him.  I on the other hand work in a very small office so I brought a variety to work and put them in our freezer.  In the morning I just pop one into the microwave for 45 seconds and I have a warm, tasty breakfast.  I especially like the gooeyness of the melted caramel and chocolate from those varieties.<br /><br />At an average of 300 calories it is a good meal alternative and is very filling.  It is a nice alternative to drinking a slim fast for breakfast, though I do sometimes still do Slimfast for breakfast and have a cookie for lunch.<br /><br />I would like to see them come in a variety dozen.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Good, but I didn't receive what I ordered
review/text: After seeing these featured on a tv show, we decided to try them since we're sick of protein bars and other breakfast bars.  We ordered the oatmeal raisen and the double chocolate chunk.  Instead of the chocolate chunk, I got cherry chocolate chunk which I probably would never have ordered.  We have been eating them and they are decent tasting although fairly high calorie so it's just something to be aware of in case you thought they were a diet food.  I was disappointed that my order was wrong, especially since I only bought two flavors.  I am not a fan of the cherry-chocolate flavor, but the oatmeal raisen is ok (maybe a little too sweet).  Personal preference.  I'd buy them again in some other flavors to see what else is out there.

review/text: This is gross. The calories are very high and the product does not taste good. If anyone has had odawalla bars, this cookie has that taste. This could be worse than those bars. For something with 300 calories, I would expect it to have a decent taste. Don't waste your money on this product.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredients, they are the same for almost all flavors of this cookie. So basically, all the other flavors will have a similar flavor.<br /><br />If this product is improved, maybe more people will buy it.<br /><br />Expect to use the bathroom more when using this product. This is a plus and a negative.

review/summary: Too Much Sugar!
review/text: I was looking for something quick and healthy-but after seeing that each cookie has 22 grams of sugar, I was appalled that it was called "healthy"!  We aren't supposed to have more than 15 grams of sugar for a whole day, and this had 22 grams per cookie!  Ugh!  Pureed prune, evaporated cane juice, and more, made it very Unhealthy.  Healthy would be stevia (which also lowers your blood pressure) and xylitol as they have a "zero" count for sugar but taste sweet.  Sucralose is Splenda and is really bad for your body as it contains chlorine, and can damage your organs and reproductive functions.  If stevia or xylitol was used, you'd definitely have another customer.  :)

review/text: I did not realize how large this would be when I ordered it. It barely fits in my refrigerator. For the price it's great, if you can handle the large quantity. There are some better tasting vinegars, but at a much higher price. I got tired of running out of balsamic, since I eat a lot of salad, but this monster may last me over a year! The biggest problem is figuring out how to pour it without a lot of spilling. I have been using a funnel.

review/summary: Good quality vinegar; here's how to dispense it
review/text: This is a good quality vinegar. Concerning how to dispense it from the 10-liter jug, I wrote the following as a comment on another review:<br />"I just purchased this from Amazon after using the Roland 5 liter pouch, which is not available. How to dispense this? Here is what I came up with, and it seems to work. Buy a spigot: I purchased a Carlisle 2212, but Amazon has a Tomlinson Ceramic Crock Lever Faucet, which seems to be the same. They have a 3/4 inch threaded shaft, rubber washers, and a nut to seal the spigot. I drilled a 3/4 inch hole in the cap, cleaned the hole with a file and sandpaper, and installed the spigot onto the cap. Then I screwed the cap onto the container and put it in place in the basement, where I will fill smaller bottles from the spigot. It seems not to leak and should work fine. I hope this helps others."<br />Now, a couple of weeks later, I have dispensed two bottles from the jug, and the spigot works fine without leaks. I punched a small hole in the top of the jug to let in air.

review/text: This vinegar is great because you can buy it bulk and save. I can't even find Balsamic at Costco in this quantity and at this price.<br /><br />This balsamic is perfect for making your own dressings, vinaigrette and marinades. It's also wonderful if you like to make reductions for glazes or if you just want to concentrate it and put it in a squeeze bottle for garnishing dishes.<br /><br />Flavor is very good so you're not getting some bargain brand balsamic vinegar taste. You know the kind I'm talking about where it's basically red wine vinegar with food coloring and caramel color added in order to make it look like balsamic.<br /><br />You will not go wrong with this purchase if you use Balsamic vinegar frequently.

review/summary: best japanese rice ever
review/text: I've been making/eating Japanese rice for over twenty years. Having lived in NYC most of my life there were many places to source fine Japanese goods so I've been a little spoiled by access to the best ingredients; having moved out west a couple of years ago sometimes ingredients are harder to find. There were no reviews on this rice on the day I purchased it and I'm so glad I took a chance; this is hands down the best Japanese rice I have had in a very, very long time. Unusually fine short grain.  I made a batch the first night it arrived intending to pair it with some leftover chicken curry. When the rice was done, I went to take a taste and sweet Jesus!, was that good. Firm bite yet tender yield. A bare hint of sweetness. In a word - delicate. Another taste, then a bowl. Needed not a drop of shoyu or anything - naked perfection. I wound up forgetting all about the curry.

review/summary: Pleasant, rich, and more than worth the trouble
review/text: I long assumed there was no meaningful difference between whatever pepper came pre-loaded in a salt & pepper shaker set and the little tin boxes of pepper in the spice aisle and either of those couldn't be far behind any freshly ground pepper. There's probably some difference but basically pepper is pepper, right? Well, turns out that's a bit like saying "Coffee is coffee, right?" More accurately, basic grocery store pepper flavor-wise is like the decaf instant coffee of the world, and these peppercorns are like a fresh roast from a favorite coffee shop - their quality is so different they're incomparable, one an unflattering caricature of the other. If you are even remotely tempted then get a grinder (I'm very happy with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00032RYP4">Kyocera Ceramic Fine Mill, Black Top</a> myself) and get this pepper. You will not regret it! And you will be re-paid many times over by the faces of those who taste your food!<br /><br />This pepper is rich, soft and pleasant, but still assertive. My wife and I agreed on the first bite that the pepper we had been using (and always just thought hey that's what pepper is) was not only bland but also sharp, even acrid, by comparison. I cook enough that I made it through my last pepper tin (about 3 oz) in about 5 months, so it wasn't brand new but it's not like I'm comparing this to something I found in my cupboard dating back to the Carter administration.<br /><br />Make no mistake, I'm no expert, but I have a feeling many of the people checking this out are in the boat I was in last week, maybe can't imagine spending more than $3 to $5 on pepper, maybe can't imagine it will be worth the extra step of grinding to use, and that's why I'm writing this to say yes it totally is worth the extra step and more. But if by contrast you're already a pepper connoisseur then I can't really give you any insight comparing this to other "real" peppercorns (though I hope to try more in the near future!)

review/summary: Definitely a Worthwhile Buy
review/text: I read the longest review on this page, and it is right in every respect. One area I can add on, however, is that I have used black peppercorn grinders for a while now. I refuse to use black pepper any other way. Previous to me getting this stuff, I had used McCormick's from the grocery store. McCormick's was around $4 for a 1.5 oz jar! This pepper is far and away superior to their pepper, and much cheaper for the size of the bag. Even though it was "fresh" ground, the pepper doesn't taste anywhere near as complex and flavorful as the Tellicherry. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys black pepper, and especially if you cook a lot. The only drawback for some may be that you also have to purchase a grinder of your own, but once you take that step, you'll never use pre-ground pepper again.

review/text: I saw a cooking show when he was trying to crack KFC's secret recipe. Someone revealed that this Telecherry pepper was in the Colonels secret stuff. I had to get some and run it through my pepper cracker to see if it was all it was portrayed to be. Well, it is! Very tasty yet not overpowering. Being sealed in this airtight bag my first sniff made me sneeze. Good stuff and fresh!

review/text: P.S. Do not forget the TELLICHERRY PEPPER__ It goes well with the Himilayan Pink Crystal salt. If you love pepper as we do, then get the pepper also, and you should consider the salt and pepper mill grinders!! They work beautifully, and measure just the right amount of seasoning on your food. Go ahead!! Jump in and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: The stinkiness is worth it
review/text: I've bought several small bags of different types of food, and this is my puppy's favorite.  It has a slightly fishy odor, but whenever she catches a whiff, she gets excited, like I'm giving her a bowl of pure cookies.  I notice that my dog seems to fill up on less of this type of food, so it may almost be worth the expense.  I may still try to vary this and a few other types of food, but I plan to always have some salmon Spot's Stew on hand.<br /><br />One caveat-- this food gives my little pug ATOMIC FARTS.  Last night I brought her to a party, and gave her a small container of Spot's Stew to munch.  On the way home, I had to leave the windows of the car rolled all the way down, as my adorable little puppy, so cute curled up on the passenger seat, was erupting wave after wave of nostril-burning, noxious, silent-but-deadlies.  Her actual poop isn't so bad-- solid and easy to pick up.  But I will not be feeding this to my dog before sharing a small space or meeting in-laws again!

review/summary: My 9wk old American Eskimo puppy likes it
review/text: I got my American Eskimo puppy when she was 8 weeks old and just weaned off her mom. This is the third brand that I've tried and she seems to like it a lot. First, it was 1lb bag of Iams Smart Puppy. She ate it but only when she was really hungry and I had to hand feed her if I wanted her to eat the whole serving. I tried adding a little water to soften the crunchies and then she would eat it with some coaxing. Second brand is the 6lb Wellness Super5Mix recommended by other puppy owners I met at Petco. She reacted the same as she did with the Iams food. I think my puppy doesn't like the hardness of the food pellets. Maybe it bothers her growing teeth. Both Iams and Wellness have the same size food pellets and about the same hardness.<br /><br />I did some online research and narrowed down on some other natural dog food brands. I liked one of the previous reviews on Amazon on Halo Spot's Stew, Wild Salmon Recipe for Puppies. Petco has a sale on a 3lb bag for $8.99 so I decided it's worth the try. Upon opening the bag, I noticed the food pellets are significantly smaller than Iams and Wellness AND the smell actually smelled like food! Both Iams and Wellness wreaked of vitamin supplements that my puppy probably didn't like.<br /><br />I still have the 6lb bag of Wellness Super5Mix that I mix in with the Halo Spot's Stew. When she feeds, she's excitedly eating the food up instead of running away from the food! I wish that pet stores had small sampler bags to try before you commit to even a 3 lb bag of dog food.

review/text: I am satisfied with the product for its spicy delicious taste that reminds me of the delicious foods of Korea I tasted in Korea and its side-dish, the Kimchee. No Korean dish is complete without Kimchee. All I have to get is the Napa and/or the Bok-Choy or both to make the dish.  On ordering the product the delivery is always on time and quick and the packaging excellent.

review/summary: Expensive but worth it.
review/text: My puppy was losing hair and itching like crazy on the dry dog food from the grocery store. I bought one bag of this based on the reviews here and Ellen's participation in the product. Within two weeks he was eating half as much food, but gaining muscle mass and had a thick shiny coat. 2 bags later and I decided to change to some other fancy brand that was supposed to be as good but much cheaper. The day after starting to change my puppy's food over, the new brand was recalled. Halo is expensive, but I lost a dog due to the '06-'07 recalls. Never again.

review/summary: The best food we've ever fed our dogs!
review/text: My dogs love this food! The kibbles are very small, so all sizes of dogs can manage it well. We wet it down, as three of our littles lost some teeth, and they gobble it up every meal. I would recommend that you ask your vet for exact feeding amounts for your dog, so that you are not over feeding. Labels tend to list larger than necessary amounts.

review/summary: This is the one!
review/text: My dog ate this food from the time we adopted her until shortly before we moved to a town where I couldn't purchase it locally, (about 6 years) so I switched her to Wellness. That went well for about eight months and then our dog developed bouts of diarrhea that lasted for weeks. At that point, I switched her to yet another Wellness formula and we got another seven months before the diarrhea came back. I tried to switch her to yet another formula of Wellness, but couldn't even complete the transition without the diarrhea coming back. A light bulb went off at that point and I looked on Amazon for Halo spots stew. Nowadays it can be purchased with FREE shipping. I never would have switched if that was available when we moved!  She's been on the chicken spots stew for many months now without any digestive issues whatsoever!  The whole family is much happier and healthier because of Halo.

review/summary: Great Source Found for Farro at Amazon
review/text: Loving everything Italian, I started cooking with farro when I first saw it, but my local, reasonably-priced imported supply was undependable or way too expensive when they got in a different brand.  When I went on-line to find a good, well-priced source, this product was the answer to my search.  The price to buy two 3-lb bags of Roland Farro plus the shipping was very much in line with the reasonable price I had been paying locally.  The grain is absolutely delightful and of the highest quality.  I just made one of my favorite Italian recipes,a soup,using this brand of farro and it is delizioso!  I'm so happy to be able to count on getting this regularly, delivered speedily to my door and am looking forward to summer farro salads and exploring other recipes using this beautiful, healthful product.

review/summary: Definitely worth a try...
review/text: I had been reading about Farro for a while and was very curious to try it.  I purchased the 3 pound bag because it was a great price.<br /><br />The first thing I did was make a Farro Mac and Cheese that was featured in Rachael Ray's magazine.  My husband went insane, he loved it so much.  Its a very hearty grain, but is also very creamy....almost like barley....making it a great addition for soups, salads and casseroles.  I froze the leftovers and they held up very, very well.<br /><br />My only complaint was in the packaging...there wasn't instructions on how to prepare it.  Just a specific recipe using Farro as an ingredient. However, I looked it up online and was able to find a lot of basic preparation recipes.<br /><br />It seems like whenever I read about a new ingredient and can't find it at any of my local grocery stores, I can always find it at Amazon.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this again!

review/summary: Hard to find tasty, healthy grain
review/text: We have enjoyed this grain in very limited quantities for years finding it only in one Italian specialty store where it is quite expensive.  This larger quantity is more reasonably priced and it stores well in a glass jar.  I prepare it occasionally using the recipe on the back of the original bag but increasing the ground meat to one pound to serve more people.  Farro has a wonderful flavor prepared this way or just simmered in chicken broth.  It is good served along side a meat or grilled Italian sausages or as an accompaniment to grilled veggies for a vegetarian meal.

I've loved farro since childhood (a much-loved, traditional grain in the region of Italy where my family is).  A simple bowl of farro cooked in a broth of garlic and pepperoncino with a drizzle of olive oil and dash of parmigiano on a cold winter's night, oh there is nothing more soothing and satisfying. Buon appetito!

review/text: The farro  arrived promptly and was much less expensive than my local specialty foods store.  I first tried farro in a little restaurant in Newport Beach and fell in love. It is a lot heavier than pasta, so it keeps you full for hours. Most recipes that I found use it in salads and soups; however, you can use it in place of pasta. Goes well with tomato sauces. Has a texture similar to that of cracked wheat.

review/summary: Best Farro We've Tried
review/text: We're relatively new to farro, but after just one taste, we're completely hooked on this delicious little grain. It's super easy to cook, and it has a wonderful nutty taste and chewy texture. It's high in fiber, and it doesn't need much added to make a complete dish. I cook 1 and a 1/2 cups (dry) in 6 cups of water for 30 minutes on medium high heat, drain, and then add 1/2 a jar of Trader Joe's Bruschetta mix and a can of white beans. Voila! 6 servings made, and it tastes great cold, room temp, or warm. I've tried some other brands, and Roland's is the best. I buy and use a 3 lb bag monthly; we love it THAT MUCH. It's great for picnics since it doesn't need to be refrigerated, and it can be used as a side dish or main dish, depending on the size of your appetite. Try it; you'll like it.

review/text: about 6 months ago I decided it was time to eat healthier and while doing internet searches on different whole grains I run into Farro, I initially purchased a small batch at a local health store ($10.99 x #) cooked it in many different ways and immediately fell in love, very versatile great in earthy soups, excellent addition to salads but my favorite way of cooking it is risotto style, literally if you have cooked risotto (with arborio rice) you can do the same with Farro. What I love about Roland Farro is that the grains a fairly big, uniforms and very little cleaning is required in fact I just give it a quick rinse and then cook. Google for recipes and you will be surprised

review/summary: OUTSTANDING PRODUCT!!!!
review/text: I ordered this Farro not quite knowing what to expect, but I am overwhelmed with its fantastic flavor and freshness.  It's an ancient grain, the actual precursor of our modern wheat, but with many more nutrients and more fiber!  So far, I've used it as a substitute for ground beef in a tortilla soup recipe, a side dish with steak, and a replacement for toasted nuts in a bread recipe...........wonderful results in all!!  I'm not a big fan of rice, but this product is an outstanding replacement in all situations I've encountered.  If you simply want to try it alone, pour some into boiling water, cook for about 10 minutes, drain in a colander, and then melt some butter (or substitute) into it..........you'll be amazed!!  Happy eating!!<br />Loren in Big Cabin, Oklahoma

review/summary: Ancient grain, healthy and versatiile
review/text: Farro is an ancient type of wheat, one of the oldest known to man, mainly used in Italian dishes.  I bought some to try, and we enjoyed it so much that I plan to always have some in the pantry.  I soaked it overnight, as suggested by a website I found.  It cooks faster after soaking, although it stays chewy after cooking.  It also takes somewhat longer to cook than wheat, brown rice, spelt or barley -  30-45 minutes.<br /><br />Farro can be used in soups the same way barley is used, or it can be made into an oatmeal type breakfast cereal (yummy with honey or maple syrup), or it can be used as a seasoned side dish the way you would serve brown rice.  It would also be good in cold salads similar to tabbouleh.  It has a nutty, wholesome flavor and is very filling without being heavy.<br /><br />It's an excellent source of complex carbohydrates, and it has twice the fiber and protein of wheat. Farro has has low levels of gluten, for those with dietary restrictions.  It contains healthy amounts of iron, niacin, magnesium and zinc.<br /><br />Roland Farro is a great product at a great price. It will ship free if you use Amazon Supersaver Shipping (orders over $25), and you'll save 15% on the purchase price if you use the Subscribe and Save option.
