review/text: I absolutely love these shortbread cookies.  Unfortunately my store is out of them and doesn't know if they'll get them back in stock.  They are plain shortbread...not flavored.  I would order the butterscotch if I knew the nutrition count was the same.  Could someone give me the nutrition count on the flavored ones?<br /><br />The plain ones are:  76 cal,  2.5 fat,  5 carbs,  less than 1 protein,  0 fiber.  Serving size 3 to 4 cookies.<br /><br />On weight watchers these are only 1 point a serving.<br /><br />Thank You,  Eileen

review/summary: Good, but need to put in some work to make it "hearty"
review/text: This is a pretty good soup mix. It's the typical variety of beans, split peas and dried vegetables plus a seasoning pack. Very easy to make - bring 7 cups of water to a boil, add the beans, simmer for 2 hours, and add the seasoning pack about 10 minutes before it's done. Good flavor - not spicy, but not bland either. Does not taste salty but, if you're on a sodium-restricted diet, note that the sodium count is pretty high (660mg).<br /><br />It is not, however, what I would call hearty. There's only 6 ounces of beans, so when you add 7 cups of water you're getting a pretty thin soup. But, you can easily dress it up a bit. I use the soup as a base, and add in things such as rice, pasta, diced potatoes, diced ham, shredded chicken, greens (such as swiss chard, spinach or kale), fresh or frozen vegetables, and so on. Not all at once, of course - just toss in whatever is hanging around the fridge or pantry. A dash or two of hot sauce often hits the spot as well. Making it with 50% water and 50% stock (either chicken or turkey) also helps put a bit more hearty into the pot.<br /><br />If you use this as a starter and dress it up, it's well worth getting, especially if you can get it on one of the sharply discounted sale prices. On its own it tastes good, but it's way too watery to be considered a hearty soup.

review/text: Like the other reviewers the name IS deceiving. This is not the "stick to your ribs" bean soup Grandma made in the winter. You really MUST take the previously mentioned suggestions and add more goodies to it to make it HEARTY. You need 2 hours after the water has boiled until it's ready to eat...NOT a quick after-work meal. However, with the 50% off sale price AND free super saver shipping it's a deal at about 20 bucks plus or minus!<br /><br />I can't find the Expiration/Sell by date. After having "interesting pets/pests" arrive with a couple AMAZON fulfilled purchases, I'm not comfortable they're watching the dates themselves. There's no way to know UNTIL the items arrive, but customer service will do their best to address any problems or concerns.

Now postage on that grand box O'bags O'beans is $18.45. SO I am thinking that Mandy Patinkin is going to deliver this box of goodies, right? Yeah right!<br /><br />No thanks!<br /><br />Even though I was angry at the time it is still a wonderful product, it needs a few extras added to it ot make it a real meal but, the flavor is great...<br /><br />Still ya gotta admit that $18.45 shipping for beans is steep for anyone...

review/summary: Tasty soup fed our family for about $7
review/text: Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup fed our family of four for about $7. The directions called for 8 cups of either water or milk; my wife added 4 cups of each. We enjoyed the soup with buttered bread.<br /><br />One package of soup: $3.17 (we saved a couple dollars on a promotional deal)<br />4 cups of milk: $1.80<br />8 slices of bread: $1.40<br />Butter: $0.55<br />Total: $6.92<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7EU0">Country Collection Spuds 'N Chives Potato Soup</a> is tasty. We added a couple drops of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051C0KJS">Lea and Perrins Worcestershire Sauce</a> to each bowl. As I mentioned earlier, one package fed us all, including our two sons (ages 9 and 8). If you have two teenage boys, you probably should make a second package to fill them up.<br /><br />The soup's ingredients are: dehydrated potatoes, chopped onions, parsley, partially hydrogenated soybean oil, wheat flour, hydrolyzed soy protein, lactose, maltodextrin, sodium caseinate, chicken fat, salt, dipotassium phosphate, turmeric & silicon dioxide (added to prevent caking).<br /><br />These are the preparation instructions on the package: "Empty contents into medium saucepan. Add 8 cups of water or for a richer soup add milk. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. To thicken, remove lid and let stand for 5-10 minutes. (A crock pot works great.) You may want the soup to simmer for a couple of minutes so the little potatoes can soften."<br /><br />The package also lists these variations: "For a great chowder, you can add jack cheese or mozzarella and the add oysters, clams, or throw in some corn. Garnish with bacon bits and for color, add some chopped pimento."<br /><br />In summary, this is a suitable (and affordable) meal for a fall or winter day. The potato soup is good by itself but I encourage you to try the variations recommended by the company.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/summary: My dog now thinks his pills are treats!
review/text: I have a big dog (120lbs) with allergies and getting him to take his allergy pills every day used to be such a chore. When I tried putting his pills in food like hot dogs or peanut butter, he would after a while refuse to eat that food anymore, knowing I put yucky pills inside! Eventually I just resigned myself to sticking them down his throat, and getting such a big dog to do something he hates that much is no mean feat, not to mention it meant I got my hands covered in slobber (talk about yucky). Until, that is, a friend told me to try these. Now my dog thinks he's getting a treat every time, and if he does know there are pills inside he doesn't seem to care.<br /><br />One thing I'd recommend is, if you can't decide what size to get definitely get the bigger ones--you can cut them in half if you have smaller pills and they're about the same size as the small ones, but way more for your money. Also, note that with the beef flavored ones, the main ingredient is actually chicken (which my dog is allergic to). The duck and pea allergy ones though are perfect!

review/summary: Works with my picky Golden
review/text: We've been using Greenies Pill Pockets for years, but my elderly Golden Retriever who has cancer (and thus requires a lot of medication) has become picky and won't eat the normal chicken or beef Pill Pockets.  He's even learned to spit the pills out and eat the pocket.  However, the Roasted Duck and Pea Allergy Formula Pockets must be too strong for his nose to penetrate and detect the pills, for he gobbles then up regardless of their medical contents.  This has helped keep us from trying to hide his pills in cheese, cream cheese, little sandwiches, and other creations.  However, if you are hiding capsules or any decent size content, be absolutely sure to get the pockets for Capsules only. The package says "Capsules" (and not "Tablets" or "Tablets / Capsules". The packages come with 25 pockets each.  Although expensive, this is a great product.

review/text: I bought these because I have one dog that is allergic to corn, and all the other pill pockets have corn, while these don't.  I have used this product in the past, with good results, and this company was selling them at a good price, so I thought I'd try them.  It took almost three weeks for them to ship, and they only did so after I finally asked when they would be shipping.  I finally got the pill pockets, and it turned out that they sent me the wrong ones, which have corn in them. I contacted the company, and they sent me a return label (which only took 2 days) and told me they'd put the money back on my credit card. It's been a week and a half since I sent the product back to them, and I'm still waiting for my money.  I will not buy anything from them again.

review/summary: Cat Pill Pockets better value for dogs
review/text: My dog has many allergy sensitivities, and receives several medications per day for them.  For years he has been able to pick the pill out of anything I tried to hide it in... peanut butter, cheese, etc. I finally had the best success with gently force-feeding his pills down his throat.<br />These are the first pill tool that works! He waits anxiously for his 'treats' now, and catches them in his mouth. The pills never come back out unless he misses the catch and they occasionally bounce out on the floor.<br />I started buying the feline Pill Pockets for my dog, because his pills aren't very big, but he receives several per day, so the feline version is a better economy... 40 per bag instead of 25 dog pockets for the same price. The difference? They cat version is smaller than the dog version... but I'm not giving him horse pills, so they still work! I can easily squeeze a Benadryl & Prednisone in one pocket.  I put out enough money on vet appointments & medications for my little allergy boy... it's nice to find a few ways to save a few pennies while making his meds easier to administer.

I've searched the world, via the internet, and I have yet to find a perfect matchup.<br />For me, I consider the this Cola syrup and the Soda-Club Cola syrup to be equals. The taste is about the same. Cost wise, also about the same, as the Soda-Club mix comes in a smaller container that you use less of, but with this Syrup you get a lot more, but have to use a little more for the same results.<br />So in the end, if I am already ordering something else from the Soda Club, then I would just use the Cola syrup they sell, otherwise, I would order this syrup.

review/summary: A S......T H E......S T O M A C H......T U R N S............
review/text: BAAR Cola Syrup at least TASTES good. I agree with my fellow reviewers who say it tastes good. It's exactly like coca-cola in flavour, except that it's not quite as sweet.  (And thus, doesn't even approach Pepsi-Cola in intensity of sweetness.)  No matter -- I just add a few packets of my own favourite artificial sweetener....<br /><br />This syrup, however, lists "High Fructose Corn Syrup and/or Sucrose" as its first ingredient.  Sucrose is another word for sugar....bad enough, but at least it's been used for thousands and thousands of years, and most people, throughout history, who have imbibed sucrose/sugar, have lead relatively normal,(and normal-length), lives.  But High Fructose Corn Syrup, though also natural, is a somewhat modern invention.  Thus, the claim above the name, "Cola Syrup", right in the middle of the front of the label, (that this is an "Old Fashioned Remedy") is patently false.<br />(H.F. Corn Syrup was first -- unsuccessfully -- produced in 1957, and then sucessfully mass-produced and introduced into foods in 1975.)  Even if you are born in 2010, anything that has been around in foods for only 35 years, (since 1975), can hardly be called "old-fashioned"!  Also, the listing of TWO ingredients, ("High-Fructose Corn Syrup AND / OR Sucrose"), as the possible number one, (largest amount) ingredient, is misleading, confusing, and (almost?) a violation of the law which mandates ingredients in food be listed in descending order of their amounts.  Are these "And/Or" ingredients listed alphabetically?  In order of how many bottles have HFCS, and how many have sucrose?  And how does one know, (if one is not a celebrity and is possibly being given the bottle for advertisement purposes), if the bottle one has purchased have the HFCS or the Sucrose?<br /><br />It is also totally astonishing to me that, according to the bottle, this product's manufacturer, BAAR, is the official supplier of Edgar Cayce Products!  The insignia of "Cayce Care" is, indeed, on this label!  And although the insignia is quite pretty, (a gold-outlined, white, horizontal oval, with a pretty little maple-leaf between the words "Cayce" and "Care"), I simply<br />CANNOT believe that those who presently run the "Edgar Cayce Foundation" would ever condone the use of high-fructose corn syrup<br />in any of their products!  (Edgar Cayce himself probably never<br />heard of H.F.C.S, as he himself died in 1945.  Of course, Mr. Cayce is justly famous for his predictions of the future, (which he found whilst sleeping) -- but I am quite certain, (after reading up on H.F.C.S., on Wikipedia and elsewhere), that if Mr.<br />Cayce ever DID dream of H.F.C.S., he probably put it in the "nightmare" classification, and tried to forget all about it as much, and as soon, as possible!  In his place, I know that's what I would have done!)  To find high-fructose corn syrup in an Edgar Cayce Product is totally beyond belief. For myself, I will continue to admire, and research the modest, but completely genuine and gifted genuis who was Edgar Cayce -- but I will get my cola syrup elsewhere!<br /><br />And, where elsewhere?  From SodaSteam Soda Mix!  Slightly more expensive than this "Baar" Cola Syrup, it gives one: 1) A much, much thicker syrup, but the same 16 ounce size  2) Sweetening with SPLENDA.  Many people are down on Splenda, but it has been cited as the safest of the artificial sweeteners by David Zinczenko, of the "Eat This -- Not That" series of books.  Too much of anything is not good, of course, (I found that using too much Splenda gave me, personally, elevated readings on my liver tests....so I cut down) -- but from all I've read, Splenda is better than High-Fructose Corn Syrup, by a couple of miles!<br /><br />So, it's SodaStream Soda Mix Cola flavour for me.  If I find a healthier alternative than that, I will switch, (and hopefully be able to share my discoveries in an Amazon review).  But, as of now, I don't think I will buy BAAR Cola Syrup, (Old-Fashioned Remedy....?????), thin, watery, and most probably laced with High-Fructose Corn Syrup, ever again!<br /><br />Near the bottom of the front of the label, it proclaims that this cola syrup, "Soothes Stomach Upset".  But knowing I know now, this effect is, for my stomach, very, very temporary, at best.  H.F.C.S. -- "High-Fake-Customer-Switcheroo" syrup, is not something that I recommmend....for anyone!

review/text: I bought this in the 2 bag pack at Costco and was pleasantly surprised at how crispy and chocolately this cereal is. It's got just the right amount of sweetness and leaves you with a great bowl of chocolate milk at the end, which is always a plus for me. The sugar content per serving is the same as Honey Nut Cheerios and is only 100 calories per serving, making it a good choice for a midday snack for my kids.<br /><br />As for the Amazon price, how can you beat the subscription price? It comes out to $2.45 a box, which is like 60% off of grocery stores. My kids love it and I eat it for breakfast often myself as well.

I very seldom eat cereal for breakfast these days, but my wife does and Cheerios are one of her favorites. Lately, she's been bringing Chocolate Cheerios home and says that she prefers them to the original. I tried them and they are indeed good. My young son (three years old) loves them, seemingly better than the old Cheerios. Well, he can be hard to feed, so if he loves Chocolate Cheerios and they're deemed nutritious enough then that's part of what he's going to get.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I'm so happy Chocolate Cheerios exist!  What a fantastic cereal!  Alright so it's probably unhealthy to the max since, you know, it's chocolate and according to my dentist and my deteriorating teeth, chocolate is a very bad thing... HOWEVER!  Taste-wise, you can't beat the chocolatey goodness of Chocolate Cheerios.  I highly recommend it to everyone who brushes regularly (and I'm not being sarcastic either- had I actually brushed during my teenage years, my teeth would be fine now and eating this cereal would have been no problem whatsoever).  Still, NOTHING beats Honey Nut Cheerios, and nothing ever will.  This is just a nice alternative from the norm.

Most of the time, when you have chocolate in cereal, the chocolate is either to weak, or to strong of a taste. I'm pleased to report that this isn't the case for the Chocolate Cheeriors. The chocolate blend is perfect.  It does turn the milk chocolate, so that's a bonus.  If you want your kids to eat breakfast, the I highly suggest you get this for them.

review/summary: Amazon's Subscribe & Save program makes this a sweet deal
review/text: My wife likes to start her day with a taste of chocolate, so when Amazon's Subscribe & Save program began offering Chocolate Cheerios at a competitive price we placed an order. The first shipment arrived with an added surprise - each box has a Spongebob Squarepants toy inside! Our sons (ages 8 and 7) happily prepare their mother's morning bowl of cereal, knowing each serving gets them one step closer to completing the 8-piece collection.<br /><br />Of course, my wife would eat Chocolate Cheerios with or without the toy. She eats the cereal with 2% milk and a cup of black coffee because, really, you don't need cream or sugar when you're eating a bowl of chocolate cereal.<br /><br />Getting to the basics: the cereal was tightly packaged with no damage; the expiration date extends at least 12 months out, so there's no mad dash to consume six boxes at once; and the price is competitive with the supermarkets we regularly patronize. The added convenience of the cereal arriving at our doorstep rather than hauling it home in shopping bags is a bonus.<br /><br />Personally, I don't touch the stuff. I'm more of a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LV6LQS">Post Raisin Bran Cereal</a> kind of guy. And, yes, of course, we buy that through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program as well.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars

review/summary: Rich, aromatic beans, but somewhat lacking in complexity
review/text: Thought I'd give these a try as the local grocery store that sells Peet's closed down recently and it costs about $8 to ship beans to my house.  Peet's Major Dickason's blend is one of my favorite coffees - a medium bodied, rich, and _complex_ bean (if you've never tried it, you should!).  I'm no coffee snob, but it has a certain finish to it that I haven't tasted in other beans - everyone that tastes it always asks what type of coffee it is.<br /><br />I don't think this bean and roast can match, but it's still a very, very good.  When you open the tin, you can see the oils still on the beans (this is essential to a rich tasting brew) and the aroma of the beans is simply fantastic.  The medium roast is just right for my wife and I but it definitely doesn't measure up to Peet's Major Dickason's blend.  That said, I wouldn't hesitate to buy more of these beans.  The tins are a nice size and fill up my air-tight container to the rim and I've gotten complements on the coffee when I've served it to others.  A good buy and I'll probably try out a few other Kicking Horse roasts.

review/summary: The Smell of Morning...Mmmmmm
review/text: What can I say, well a lot really.  When it comes to this coffee, I am what you might call an "Addict"  The coffee is the smell of morning to me, when I run low I start to panic!  I was first introduced to Kicking Horse when it was available at retail shop that I have easy access to.  Because of the economy (I hate that term, it's like it excuse all bad things.) this Store was closed and now nobody has it locally.  That was the beginning of the summer.  My first reaction was to call Kicking horse and ask what the closest place was.  Nothing closer then 4 hour drive.  My wife and her best friend went on an overnight trip and bought up all they could find for me.  Good bless them, I am loved:)By the end of summer this supply was close to exhaustion.  I called again and was told that it was available on Amazon!  So I Begin ordering it that way.  I am waiting on my next shipment, that should arrive any day.  This is a good thing since I have enough left for about two more mornings.  My advice...If you try it be prepared to love it!!!  Full flavored, but not to obnoxious,  The Smell of Morning!  Enjoy.  -T.

review/summary: Amazing, Amazing product.
review/text: I was not sure what to expect with this product since I haven't ever used any type of candy coating before. I really wanted to make these creme filled candies from the Sprinkles Bakes blog and since she recommended using an official candy coating (not just melted down chips) I found these. I made my candy last night and they turned out amazing. The quality of the chocolate is fantastic - I ordered the dark and I would say that even someone who only likes milk chocolate would like these too. It's great dark chocolate. I melted the candy down in a glass bowl over a pot of simmering water and dipped my creme confections in the bowl. The coating sets in about 30 - 60 seconds, so although I put mine in the refrigerator after dipping them - they'd probably stay hard enough if you didn't want to do that. The coating was very even and the end result was really spectacular. This might seem like more money versus the store bought chips but I think for quality and purpose, like candy or cake dipping, this chocolate is really the best. I would also say you could use this chocolate for any kind of chocolate decorating - if you were going to shape the chocolate in a certain way (like Mickey Mouse ears for a decorative cake) or anything where you need to make a shape - this would work really well because of how quickly it sets. I would buy this product again and highly recommend it.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I had recently made a molded chocolate camera with these Candy wafers. It arrived in perfect condition, none of it was clumpy or melted. It was my first time making molded candy. I microwaved  the entire candy wafers in a glass bowl, at 50% power for 20 secs, then stirring it properly after each time. I repeated this process a couple of times and after the 6th round of microwaving, my candy had completely melted. It was smooth, glossy and so delicious. I added a few drops of orange flavor candy oil and the taste was amazing. My camera turned out pretty cute.<br />After the chocolate camera had served its purpose, I broke it down into several small pieces. later remelted the pieces and used that to cover a cake! To my surprise, the candy melted once again, beautifully, and didn't lose any of its wonderful flavor.<br />I generally find that dark chocolate is not as sweet as the milk chocolate and more intense with a hint of bitterness depending on the amount of cocoa it has. I wasn't sure what this one would taste like. But to me, these dark cocoa coatings are just as sweet as regular milk chocolates and there was no bitterness at all. The flavor is really good. I would highly recommend these dark coatings to anyone.

review/summary: Oh happy day! amazon carries this!
review/text: This stuff is great, adds a special touch to my 2-layer chocolate cakes that supermarket canned frosting just can't give, even though I still use doctored cake mixes.  And since I'm too lazy to make chocolate filling/frosting from scratch, this Schmear stuff is great.  In case you're wondering what it's like, it's kind of a bittersweet chocolate taste, at least when used as a frosting (you can bake this stuff in a pastry, but I haven't done that).  Some family members & friends love it because they don't like super-sweet frostings, while others have a sweet tooth, and have a hearty scoop of vanilla ice cream on top of the cake to help balance out the bittersweet.  One can filling per 9x13 sheet or 9-inch 2-layer cake is plenty, and adding chocolate shavings on top of the cake "pretties" it up a bit.<br /><br />The Amazon six pack is nice, because I'll keep a couple cans in my cupboard, and I'll pass a couple cans to my mom, because Dad LOVES this as a frosting.  He swears it contains chocolate liqueur, even though I've read the ingredients label to him.  :)  Another nice thing, the Schmear Chocolate has natural ingredients, and no trans fats (supermarket canned frostings contain trans fats, but this Schmear doesn't).

review/summary: dark chocolate perfection
review/text: The other day daughter made a deliciously simple birthday cake for me using a boxed yellow cake an a single thin layer of this chocolate Shmear and it could not have been better! The taste is that of a high quality dark chocolate - related to grocery store brands, think a Ghiradelli or Guittard 65-70% dark, in other words dark, rich and not *too* sweet.<br /><br />It is on the thicker side if unheated so it will drag the crumb of a split cake a bit; heats beautifully though for easier spreading or even melted for use as a shiny ganache or glaze. It's a smaller container than supermarket "frosting" but it will handle two nine inch layers well because you'll need less; the flavor is *very* intense!<br /><br />My favorite uses for this Chocolate Schmear is as the topping for a Boston Cream Cake, Bismark Donuts, or as filling for chocolate croissants. It makes the most incredible homemade tasting version of a grown-up Hostess Chocolate cupcake; just add a little fresh whipped cream filling to a homemade chocolate cupcake and then top with a slightly warmed thin layer of this Schmear, Yum!!!!<br /><br />I've found it's the exceptionally perfect choice for those recipes, with the proper flavor and texture balance. It's so far and beyond regular supermarket frosting that you could use it for virtually any recipe calling for a chocolate ganache, frosting, fudge, or glaze.<br /><br />Made in my hometown of Brooklyn.<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase and *highly* recommended.

review/text: If you don't have time to make a dark chocolate ganache for filling or frosting, this is a fully acceptable ready-made option.<br /><br />It tastes great, like premium cocoa was used and does NOT bring to mind the canned frosting you find in the supermarket at all.<br /><br />It is smooth and supple and spreads great at room temp, a fast schmear gets the tasty job done.  Heated until warm, this can be drizzled on bundt cakes and such as a shiny chocolate glaze.<br /><br />Be aware that it is a pop top lid and once you open it, it does not have a lid for refrigerator storage.  No biggie for me since I just pop the leftovers in a lidded tub and store it that way.<br /><br />This is a great item to keep int your pantry, especially around the holidays.  The price here on Amazon is the lowest I have found anywhere.

review/summary: Irritates my kitty's tummies
review/text: We started buying 100% meat diets on our vet's recommendation for getting our big fatty to lose weight on a "catkins" diet. Cats are obligate carnivores, so feeding them other foods that contain rice, or lots of vegetables, really isn't in line with how their bodies have evolved. The vet recommended Before Grain and Wysong, but my cats very clearly told me they like Before Grain much better. They lap it up, have become a healthier weight (the fat one lost, the small one gained), and have had no tummy problems ever since they switched off Friskies and onto this!<br /><br />My understanding is that cats do need a few vitamins, since they do get some semi-digested vegetables from the guts of their prey. We mix in some Wysong "Call of the Wild" into the meat.<br /><br />They love the taste of the beef, but it seems to irritate their tummies.  I had a lot of yuckiness to clean up after they eat this, so I don't buy it anymore.  My understanding is that cats naturally eat small fowl and rodents, so quail is actually the closest to what they actually eat in the wild. I have trouble imagining a kitty cat taking down a big ol' cow, so it makes sense that it didn't go over well with them!

review/summary: More satisfying than the niche brands
review/text: When I was in Venice I purchased local red wine to find out what Italians drink at home. It did not taste like anything I had at the large wineries or even the upscale specialty wineries in Napa valley. I sampled the majority of California brands and varietals over a period of a decade in connection with my job. Carlo Rossi is part of Gallo and is a bulk wine. However, the preservation and consistency of the old Italian flavor has been excellent.<br /><br />Pisano is robust and complex but not as dry as burgundy and has no after taste. I find it perks up my taste buds if I have some just before and during a meal. I also use it in Italian red sauces to dampen the sweetness of tomatoes so spices were more pronounced.

The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup. Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it's in your cup before you drink it.<br /><br />The tea is also caffeine free, which is a plus for those of us who don't want caffeine in our diets. That is something I always prefer.<br /><br />If you like a cherry flavored tea with a slight berry twist to it, I highly recommend this tea! Enjoy!

After some months of constant praise for this tea, I decided to make this my tea of choice when entertaining.  Now when I entertain I make several  pots of Black Cherry Berry and everyone is happy.<br /><br />Black Cherry Berry has a simple mildly sweet taste.  Black Cherry Berry is caffeine  free and has zero calories, and no sodium or sugar.  The tea has all natural ingredients: such as hibiscus, rosehips, roasted chicory, blackberry leaves, hawthorn, natural black cherry natural flavors.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tea for entertaining guests.

review/summary: Insanely delicious...but I wish instead of "natural flavors", they'd categorize WHAT the stuff is in this...oh, well, yummy!
review/text: I have been so hooked on my Rishi and Twinings and gourmet coffees in the last couple years, that I pretty much haven't bought Celestial Seasonings teas for a spell. Well, yesterday I went to a birthday "tea party" and I wanted a non-caffeine variety. So I picked this one.<br /><br />HEAVENS! I had three cups. So lovely. Beautiful deep red color. Really nice aroma. And totally tastes like cherries (which is a flavor I love).<br /><br />I came home and ordered up a 6-pack on Amazon (hope it's not a staler batch, as I've had issues in the past with ordering tea/food items from Amazon and it being close to "sell by" date).<br /><br />This is gonna make crazy good iced tea. I could tell sipping it hot, that this would become my second fave iced tea, displacing the Republic of Tea's pomegranate one. :D<br /><br />If you like the cherry flavor in foods and beverages, and you like to eschew excessive (or any) caffeine, you will want to try this. If you're afraid of getting a 6-pack, then just get it at your grocery store, but try it. This is delicious, delicious!<br /><br />I do wish they'd spell out the specifics of the ingredients--like what these "natural flavors" are from. I have a lot of sensitivities, and I worry about the undisclosed. But, I didn't have a reaction at the tea party, so should be okay. :D<br /><br />thumbs up. Enjoy.

review/summary: Very Black Cherry Berry +++
review/text: I have tried-out this fine tea in several ways now. It was great each way -- hot or icy by itself -- or hot or icy added to regular black tea. My primary purpose was to find a good cherry tea to make my own black cherry black tea blend. This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea. It is not as tart as a "zinger" type tea -- rather just spot-on to back the black cherry blend. Celestial Seasonings has fine-tuned this blend of various organic ingredients very well -- to find a mix which is most like a rich tart black cherry tea -- great on its own or in a further mix +++

review/summary: Excellent flavor!
review/text: This tea is one of my favorites.  The flavor is very cherry, and the longer you brew it the better it tastes.  I prefer it unsweetened, and even without sugar it has turned me from my Shasta Diet Black Cherry soda addition.<br />We recently got one of those instant hot water dispensers installed in our kitchen, which has reawakened my love of tea.  This is definitely one to be tried and will be a good addition to anyone's tea choices.<br />This is still one of my favorite teas.  One of my favorite desserts is a pot of this tea to sip while nibbling on a couple pieces of dark dark chocolate.  Tastes like eating a chocolate covered cherry...yummmmm

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: This is good stuff.  I've always liked tea and I have a bit of a sweet tooth... so throwing in the black cherry/berry flavor was an almost sure winner for me.  The flavoring is pleasant, not overwhelming and the tea itself is caffeine free so it's a great late evening/relaxing drink.  I even used these to make iced tea and that was very good as well.  If you try it I hope you enjoy it as much as I did and thanks for taking the time to read my review.

review/text: This tea is delicious.  We go through box after box and it's my husband's<br />most favorite flavor.  If you like black cherry, give this a try.<br />Caffeine-free and so comforting.  We love it!

review/summary: Delicious I Love It!
review/text: I absolutely adore anything cherry.  I bought this tea in the sampler fruit package of teas.  I was curious how this would taste.  My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea is Lemon Zinger.  This is a close tie.  I know everyone says "you don't even need sugar" but I use sugar.<br /><br />I have not seen this tea sold by the box in my local store.  When I run out, I'll definitely buy it here.<br /><br />I also just can't say enough about the packaging!! It's so beautiful I don't want to throw it away!!<br /><br />Before I was introduced to Celestial seasonings I'd wrinkle my nose up at the idea of me drinking tea.  These teas have converted me!  Heck, I'm even planning on switching from using refined white sugar in my tea.

review/summary: Tasty tea!
review/text: This tea is tasty!<br />It has a nice cherry flavor with no bitter after-tones common with many teas.<br />The perfect steeping time for this tea is 5-6 minutes, depending on how strong you want it.

review/summary: Excellent cherry tea
review/text: This really is a very cherry tea. The cherry flavor is not the fake kind, and it is very noticeable. I brew it together with the Twinings Mixed fruit tea for a superb blend of fruits; it's a very well balanced and sophisticated flavor. Try them both!

review/summary: Makes Great Iced Tea
review/text: I love this stuff and it's good for you (or at least it's not bad for you).  Pretty much every day I make a large pot of one of the Celestial Seasoning's fruit teas (Black Cherry is one of my favorites) which I chill and it's my drink for the day.  It freezes well such that I can take it with me when I'm out for the day and the kids will drink it (and not bug me as much for soda and the like).
