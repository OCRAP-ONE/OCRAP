review/summary: okay for a mix
review/text: this mix is handy and quick.  It only makes about 2 1/2 - 3 doz cookies.  honestly I think the recipe using a golden butter cake mix is just as quick and makes a thicker cookie.  crispy on the outside and soft inside.  these are good to though.

review/summary: Like them all
review/text: I am on a low sodium diet. I look for ingredients that will add flavor to otherwise bland dishes. The Roland Balsamic Glazes are great on a wide variety of foods. I have tried them all, regular, fig, pomegranate, blood orange and tamarind. I like them all. A couple of other things I like a lot are sesame oil and Chef Jimmy's My Mojo. My Mojo delivers a great deal of flavor for a small amount of sodium.

review/summary: Tasty for salads
review/text: Despite the relatively high cost for the Roland Balsamic Glaze compared to store bought salad dressings I took the plunge & purchased using Amazon's subscribe and save program. I'm about finished with the first of 2 bottles & although I enjoy the taste I dropped my rating a notch due to the design of the pouring which, when refrigerated, comes out too thickly on a single plate of salad which is all I use the glaze for. This tends to provide less control as to the amount poured. I do like the pomegranate taste but won't be reordering.

review/text: I had been subscribing to regular flax meal via Subscribe and Save, and buying the golden flax meal at Sam's.<br /><br />Found this product on Amazon and the price was a fraction of what I'd paid for the golden flax meal at Sam's, so ordered it. This was worth every penny!<br /><br />Ever opened your flax meal and it has an off odor to it, or it tastes just WRONG somehow when you bake with it? This product has neither problem. I've used it in everything from muffins to pancakes to a 'cornbread' type coating while pan frying chicken. It also lends a sweet nutty taste to smoothies.<br /><br />Now this is the only flax I'll buy!

review/text: I was buying my flax seed from our local Walmart, but they quit selling it. I then got on the computer and went to Amazon.com. I found just what I was looking for, like I always do. This product is from a company that has been in business for many years and is in the "USA". I also like the plastic jugs it comes in. This flax seed is better and cheaper than what I got from Walmart, and the shipping was FREE! The box was very heavy. I'll be ordering more soon.

review/summary: THE BEST!!!
review/text: This is by far the best ground flax seed out there.  We have been using flax seed for years but has been hard to find in the local grocery store, and when they did have it, it was very pricey and then they would quit handling it.  I stumbled on this at our State Fair 2 years ago and when I started getting low I went on the old "Amazon.com" search and found it...and at an amazing price to boot.  Every day after the morning workout I make a smoothie with Almond Milk, Whey Protein (another item purchased through Amazon), 5 heaping tsp of flax seed, frozen blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, fresh pineapple and a banana.  A great healthy start to the day.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!

review/summary: None of the lids were sealed on my order!~
review/text: There was loose flax all over the inside of the box because all of the lids had not been screwed down all the way and the seals under the lids were no longer attached to the jars. I guess that the heat caused the seals to become detached. It appears that they were attached by some sort of glue versus the plastic welding technique that most products use these days. (The one where it seems almost impossible to get all of the seal off of the jar, but at least you know it was sealed well.) The quality appears good. Taste is good, but I hope that my shelf life will not be seriously hampered from this since the description reads, "naturally extended shelf life of 18-24 months AFTER OPENING." That's a pretty long shelf life anyway so I still gave this product 3 stars.

Very fresh and not quite as finely ground as some I had in the past which I actually like better.  The price was great for the amount you recieve.  Will last me a very, very long time being that I am the only one in my family that uses it!  I basically use a heaping teaspoon in my greek yougurts every other day for breakfast and it helps keeep you more regular as an added bonus! Does not need refridgeration.

review/text: I bought this product through Amazon because I could get 6 containers shipped to my home for the same price as it cost me at the store. And the closest place I could get it is a 45 minutes drive one way. Flax is a great source of Omega 3's and it can be added to almost anything. I use it on my cereal, scrambled eggs, in protien drinks and in yogurt just to name a few. And my husband even likes it! He says it adds a slightly nutty taste to things.

review/summary: Flax Seed
review/text: My husband's doctor recommended he start taking flax seed just for the overall health benefits.  I bought this item and split the six containers with five other people, so each 40oz container ended up only being $6.15 each.  Flax seed at Walmart is $8.99 for a 16oz container!  It's too early to have started to see the health benefits yet, but we are very happy with the gold flakes.  I put about 2 Tbsp in my yogurt every morning and actually enjoy it more now with the extra "texture" in it.  It can be added to baked goods, cereals, etc.  I read on a different site that flax seed will keep longer if you store it in "light proof" containers and that it should be kept cold or frozen.  The contents of one 40oz container fit perfectly in two quart-size Ziploc bags.  I put one of the filled Ziploc bags inside an empty plastic coffee can in the freezer for storage and the other half of the 40oz container in an opaque container in my fridge for everyday use.  I also read that the ground flax seed is much better than flax seed oil or whole flax seed.  I will definitely be buying this deal again.  If you haven't already, just go on the internet and read all about the health benefits of cold-milled ground flax seed.  I'm glad I did!

review/text: What can I say....It's ground flax seed.  The five stars are for the price.  I used to buy the stuff at Walmart who sold it in their baking goods section in a box at a very reasonable price.  The last time I looked for it the sales lady says "Oh, we moved it to pharmacy section."  They sure did move it, along with repackaging and bumping the price about 4 times as much.  Amazon has a great price but the only drawback is that a 6 pack of 40oz jars is a lot of flax seed.

review/text: I usually buy ground flax seed at Whole foods, 2lb bag for $4.99.  This is a better deal.  The brand I usually buy is Bob's Red Mill, and the flax seed is ground much better than the Flakes O'Gold.  This brand is ground much coarser, and the particles are a little larger than a poppy seed.  Bob's Red Mill ground flax seed is ground pretty much into powder.  I am not sure if it makes any difference when consuming it, for me it doesn't.<br />Overall, great value!

review/summary: Can't Argue with a Classic.
review/text: My favorite dark chocolate bar is Ghiradelli Sea Salt Soiree', but sometimes it just costs too much.  Hershey's Special Dark with Almonds is not as intense, but it is smoother, not as sweet as the milk chocolate--which I don't prefer--and it contains a satisfying amount of almonds that aren't chopped up into tiny pieces.  When I don't splurge on something more intense and expensive, this is always my second pick unless somebody has another brand that's more concentrated on sale.  As it is, HSDWA is more amenable to breaking down in your mouth because it's a bit creamier than your usual darks, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  It's just rich enough to win over all those milk chocolate fans who are hesitant about going too severely dark, and it's not repellently sweet like a Cadbury can often be.  Just like Coke Classic, it's hard to beat a Hershey bar in price and quality, so if you find the gourmet bars a bit too harsh and pricey, this may be the way to go.  As for me, I'm easy, and that just makes me a chocolate 'ho'(Yes, I've said that before!), and variety is the spice of life.  Make sure they're fresh, though, because sometimes you get the chalky ones, and that can be a turnoff.  LOL, I'm not picky.  I'll still eat it because it's chocolate!

review/summary: From a dedicated Dunkin' drinker
review/text: I have been a dedicated Dunkin Donuts coffee drinker for years.  To frame how I feel about this Green Mountain Colombian K-Cup I feel it might be best to share how I go about making a cup of Dunkin' coffee when I'm at home.<br /><br />I use a coffee scoop to measure out my coffee.  To my tastes, the perfect home brew is 7 mounded scoops and 7 cups of water.  I put all this in my Cuisinart 1200 and come out w/ 6 cups of java bliss.  I use sugar and milk in my coffee; when I make my coffee as stated it get a satisfying mocha swirl of coffee and milk.  Just by sight I can tell my cup is rich.<br /><br />Now, using that as my baseline, I find this K-cup to be very satisfying.  I have tried MANY kinds of regular coffee K-cups, and this is the first one that makes a satisfying cup of full bodied coffee to my tastes.  Granted, I brew on the 6oz setting.  If you take your coffee black maybe you can get away w/ the 8oz setting.  The cup reminds me of my beloved Dunkin' (note I said reminds, its clearly not Dunkin' but I don't mean that in a bad way).  It doesn't end sharp or bitter like the very popular Coffee People Donut Shop.  It has a muted finish, reasonably full body for a K-Cup, and nice flavor.  When I pour in the milk, I can take more than a drop before turning the cup white - which tells me the cup is rich.<br /><br />Its my go to cup when I'm not brewing a pot.<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I highly recommend it if you like your drip coffee as I describe above.  Why not 5 stars?  Well, it doesn't taste like the Dunkin' I brew from a drip machine, that's why !  Its at least on the same field though ...

review/summary: If you prefer a strong bold coffee - avoid this.
review/text: I try and try many Keurig blends and the biggest challenge is to truly find a strong bold coffee to match my Starbucks Dark Blends of French Roast or Italian.  I have to blend this at the smallest setting and then it's still weak and I must add a Dark Magic or Emerills Bold with it otherwise it's much too weak if your used to a strong bold coffee blend.  This tactic gets quite expensive.<br /><br />The weakest point of a Keurig are it's boldest blends cannot touch an actual strength of a Starbucks French Roast which my wife packs into a cartridge in the Keurig daily as she is used to French Press and Keurigs weakest point are it's weak coffee blends in about 90% of the cartridges I've tried.  I like Columbian Coffee taste but this stuff comes out like TEA even with the lowest volume of water.  If you favor a weak tea blend then this is your cup of tea not coffee. ;)

review/summary: My Dog Thinks This Is Her Treat For the Day!
review/text: When my vet told me my little Yorkie had stage IV luxating patellas (knees blown out), I was devastated. The vet told me to give her Glucosamine & Chondrotin. I went to the local pet chain and spent a considerable amount for the "chicken flavor" tablets. For such a large chain, tablets were the only product they carried. They are hard tablets not easily broken in half for a small (7lbs) dog.  On top of that, she wouldn't have anything to do with them, took her little nose and pushed them away. I had to start crushing them and hiding them in a piece of people food. It was such an annoyance, I began a search for a different product form and found Zuke's online.  They are soft, she can't wait for her Zuke's treat every day! No more crushing, I still have the tabs left and will now only use Zuke's. The product also includes beef, fruits, vegetables and more. I am so happy with this product, I will continue to use it. My little Echo has perked up, jumps, runs and one would never know she has this condition.  This condition, at this stage, is correctable only by surgery; thousands of dollars which I don't have. I thank the founder of this company, Patrick in memory of his dog Zuke. They also donate to the Dog & Cat Cancer Fund. I know this is a long review, but that's just because this product really deserves kudos.<br /><br />As a side note, my pain management physician also recommended "Golden Aloe" daily to help with the arthritic pain that sets in with this diagnosis. So she both and is doing well. She's my best friend, I'm on disability and won't be able to afford the surgery if and when it's required so I am really relying on these products to keep her comfortable for as long as possible and she is only 3 years old.

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these "doggie crack", our dog LOVES these treats. As soon as he sees the bag he RUNS to get his snack. Yep RUNS. Not only am I giving him something he loves but something that has helped him with mobility. I followed directions I found at a vets website to double the dose for several weeks and then give a maintenance dose of glucosamine after that....what a difference!!! Shop around as I only purchase these at the local store if I make a mistake and run out! There is quite a difference in price from stores to online. I am completely sold on this product and have now started purchasing some of their other treats and products as well!! Can't go wrong with Zukes!

review/summary: Natural treat our Bichon loves!  A plus for his joints!
review/text: We've been feeding our Bichon Zuke's hip action treats for years.  He gets one each day after breakfast and expects it.  He has had two knee operations which was one reason we looked for a treat targeted for joints, etc.<br /><br />I only rated a 4 because I have no idea if the Zuke's hip action really does work in terms of improved mobility.  Yes, he loves the treats; yes, he walks every day; and yes, we're hoping the Zuke's is working to aid his mobility.  Nevertheless, he loves the Zuke's treat and we like the fact that they're made in the USA and are natural.  Just note of caution for Bichon owners with urinary stone issues; don't feed a Bichon beef products.  The chicken is great.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/17/10<br />I've updated my rating to a 5 because I recently took our dog to the vet who confirmed, at the age of 12 going on 13, he has no arthritis.  In fact, both front and back legs have full mobility.  I do attribute part of this success to his walking every day but also to Zuke's hip action treats.  Digby's had a Zuke's hip action treat for years and this treat is the only joint action remedy we feed him in addition to Nupro All Natural Dog Suppplement for his other nutrients, minerals, and vitamins.  While Zuke's hip action treats are not the only reason he is doing so well, I believe this treat in conjunction with exercise and the proper diet have significantly contributed to his overall well being!

So then I read others reviews on Amazon and found Zuke's. I immediately bought it and gave her 2 doses a day for a week. And now she is running around the house ans jumps again. My dog doesn't like the taste but I sandwiched between the sliced cheese and she eat it with no problem. Thank you so much Zuke's. From now on I will buy every month for her.

review/summary: Thank God for Zuke's Dad!
review/text: Knowing his mother's agony, my son let his dog remain at home when he moved out, and, already spoiled, Raider became the center of our world. We would do anything for him and he returned our love tenfold. At the age of 12, our little pupcake began *screaming* whenever attempting to rise from sleep. Throughout that year his pain grew far greater...my husband and I were *forced* to have "that talk".  How much pain was too much pain? Were we just letting him live because we couldn't bear to let him go?<br /><br />On a trip to Utah, our friends saw the anguish overwhelming us.  They recommended we try Zuke's.  HOURS later, Raider was *running* for the first time in years!  He is now a happy 17-year-old, and ONLY ran into trouble the ONE time his Mommy was late in refilling the Zuke's. I kid you naught, the screaming is GONE, and has been since Day One.  We owe *so* much to that awesome hiker who owned Zuke and developed this 'treat' to help him out. As much as we wouldn't wish pain on anyone, we're so thankful Zuke had *such* a smart Daddy!!!

review/summary: Doggy Likes!
review/text: My 10 lbs chihuahua/doxie mix is a picky eater.  He isn't motivated by food at all, and it's always a trial and error when it comes to trying out a new treat.  His treats of choice are freeze-dried tripe, freeze-dried liver, freeze-dried chicken - you get the idea.  The boy has expensive taste - lol.<br /><br />That said, since he's now nearing the 9 year old mark, I wanted to begin giving him Glucosamine and Chondroitin for his hips and joints.  I started to notice that he has become a little reluctant to jump up on the bed, preferring to be helped up.  I think this is happening due to getting older. My usage of these treats is to help with prevention - better to start early before it's too late, you know?<br /><br />Feeding him pills is a hassle, and I'm already giving him globs of peanut butter a day to hide his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015GS0BY">Nutri-Vet Healthy Vision Canine Chewables</a> (I highly recommend these pills if you have a dog with vision issues).  Anyway, my quest for a non-pill form of Glucosamine and Chondroitin led me to Zuke's Hip Action.<br /><br />I love that it's wheat, corn and soy free.  My boy has skin allergies and I've been doing my best to keep his diet as clean as possible.  Each treat has 300 mg of Glucosamine and 50 mg of Chondroitin.  The treats also have antioxidants thanks to cherry, blueberry, rosemary, turmeric and seasame seed.  BTW - turmeric is a great Indian spice that also helps humans because of its anti-inflammatory benefits.  It also has egg shell membrane meal, which according to the package helps support joint health.  So, it has good stuff in it.  It's also made in the USA.  After all the issues with Chinese-made dog treats, avoiding treats from China is important to me and the health of my dog.<br /><br />For a small 46 lbs and under dog (like my Ozzy), only one treat is necessary per day.  For a medium dog of 98 lbs and under, 2 treats a day is necessary.  For a giant dog of 138 lbs and under, 3 treats are needed per day.  Each package has about 23 treats in it.  If you have a larger size dog, it definitely can get pricey.<br /><br />I feed Ozzy the peanut butter flavor, because, well, peanut butter is one of his favorite things in the world.  Each treat is square and has a moist look to it.  It has an interesting smell - not one of my favorites, but not completely a turn-off either.  Just...interesting.  But the best part is he LOVES them.  His eyes actually bug out more than the usual chihuahua buggy-eyed look, and he happily grabs it and runs off to enjoy it.  He looks forward to it every day.<br /><br />Ozzy recently had surgery on his ear, and during the time after his surgery, he was pickier than ever with food.  He refused to eat even the raw beef patties that he usually loves.  He barely even took the peanut butter hiding his eye vitamins, probiotics and antibiotics (and this is a dog that loves peanut butter)  But these Zuke treats?  Heck yeah! Never a problem.  Just goes to show how much he loves these treats.

review/summary: Nearly Miraculous
review/text: I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his "golden years" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D

However, I never give them more than a whole one in a given day because of the glucosamine and condroiten.  (I believe an excess of these ingredients is not beneficial but in limited dose may be helpful.)

review/text: Our older dog, Broccoli, has been quietly aging.  Sleeping on the couch instead of the bed, not jumping up, rarely playing...it all started so gradually we didn't really notice until he was virtually sleeping all day.  His hips were so stiff when he walked, his gate stilted and he never ran anymore.<br /><br />A friend and I were talking about his decreased mobility a few weeks ago and she recommended we try glucosamine and chondroitin, so we purchased Zuke's Hip Action (beef.)  After two weeks of feeding him a double dose, we've noticed a HUGE change.  While some stiffness in his hips is still evident, he's been running around, jumping on the bed, jumping up on his back legs and playing much more often and for longer periods of time.  Where he would once play for a few seconds and then lie down, he's now begging to play and run around.  I can't wait to see his progress in a month.  We plan to reduce the amount to the one treat a day (recommended for his size) after 6 weeks, per recommendations I've read online.  We're also giving a treat to our new puppy every day to ward off any future problems and keep his joints healthy (he's a greyhound mix with really long legs, so we're concerned about the various bone/joint problems that he could be prone to.)<br /><br />As far as taste, both dogs LOVE these treats, more than any other we've tried in fact.  We'll be giving Zuke's as a daily supplement from now on, as we're firm believers in the benefits of them.  I'm so glad to see my old friend acting like a puppy again.  Thank you Zuke's!

I figure there is no placebo effects for animals so that can't be it. The treats must have had an effect on her mobility and pain. I will be a repeat customer.

review/summary: After a month, I am a believer
review/text: I purchased both the beef and chicken flavor Hip Action about a month ago and was very skeptical for a couple of reasons. First, my dog has not liked any other Glucosomine treats I've given him in the past. The pills were difficult to get in him as well. I was also skeptical I would see any difference. My dog is a 12 year old Husky-Great Pyrenese mix and weighs about 100 pounds. He has extreme arthritis is all four legs and it is increasingly difficult for him to go up and down our stairs. After giving him 4 of these treats per day for a little over a month now, we are seeing a difference. I am so surprised! He seems to feel better and though the steps are still a challenge, he is getting up them in one try now instead of three of four tries. And, most importantly, he loves these treats! Thank you! Knowing our time left with this most important member of our family is getting shorter, I am so relieved I can make him a little more comfortable in the last stages of his life.

review/text: This product is amazing!  We had a gift card for an out of town feed store and my husband happened to pick this up.  We have an older Rott/Boarder Collie who has been having joint, arthritis trouble.  The vet has given him several medications.  One he won't eat unless I  force it and the other makes him act "wonky".  The vet says I shouldn't have a problem with either product, but I know my dog! Anyway, because of this fluke purchase, his mobility and attitude improved by "leaps and bounds" within two weeks!  He no longer cries or yelps when he tries to get up and he is much more playful.  Bucky, our dog, is also allergic to corn.  It isn't easy to find a "treat" that doesn't have corn. This product is free of corn and other additives i.e. wheat, soy, artificial colors, flavors, added fat or by-products.  The only thing I could wish for is disclosure of the caloric content.  I don't know how many calories are in a treat.  We use this in conjunction with a senior glucosamine /condroiton dog food. The 1lb pk that we purchased was $17 and a 45 minute trip out of town.  I'm down to one treat. He takes three (huge dog) a day.  I decided to see if I could get it on line.  Everything I found was still expensive especially with S&H.  And, then I thought maybe Amazon.  Sure enough there it was.  So, thanks to Amazon.  But more importantly, greatful thanks to Zuke's for a miracle product.  Couldn't be more happy.  God gave us a great gift when he gave us all our furry friends!

review/summary: Hip Hip Hooray for Zuke's
review/text: We've always liked Zuke's products so when looking for a glucosamine supplement, Zukes's was near the top of my short list of candidates. I chose the Zuke's treats because each contains 300 mg of glucosamine and because the formula contains no wheat, corn, soy, by-products, or artificials.<br /><br />Not everyone agrees on the efficacy of glucosamine, but I've taken it for years with wonderful results, and our bichon with problem hips showed marked improvement while taking glucosamine.<br /><br />These square treats are soft and easily broken into pieces if desired. Our Piper gets a Zuke's treat every night and eats it with gusto. When this bag has run its course, I'll be ordering another.

review/summary: My 3 dogs love these
review/text: I've started giving these to 2 of my dogs which are a very large breed.  They aren't really old yet, but we have mostly wood and tile floors which are hard on their joints.  So I've started giving them these in hopes of preventing - to some extent - damage and pain for them. They love these.  My small dog isn't very old, but wants them, too.  I don't think they are so good for her since she has thrown them up before.  The pieces are fairly large so the dog knows she's getting a real treat.  I haven't found any flavor that they don't like, although the Beef seems to be their favorite.  I like that they seem to be a made in the USA product since I lost a dog during the "bad dog food" epidemic. Since then, I've been very careful what I give my dogs.

review/text: I have tried a lot of different arthritis supplements for my small dogs, but this one is the best product I have found for the price.  My dogs love it and it is wonderful to see them running around where before they could hardly move for the pain.  Granted, they are old (one is 17 and one is 13) but I believe this product has given them a better quality of life, which, after all, is exactly what we want for our pets.

review/summary: It Works!
review/text: We have a 15-year old arthritic Siberian Husky.  We had tried over-the-counter glucosamine for him, but it did nothing.  A vet then told us most pills sold over-the-counter are poor quality and do not sufficiently digest and enter the bloodstream...for humans or dogs.  We later tried Zuke's Hip Action, and definitely saw a difference.  We have been using them for several years now.  Our dog's arthritis progressed, so he's now on prescription meds and senior dog food (which also has gulcosamine), but he's doing great...running up and down stairs, playing.  People think he's a puppy!  He quickly tired of the beef flavor Hip Action, but still loves the peanut butter flavor.  We'll continue using this product as long as we have our dog.

She loves the way the treats taste; and best of all she is walking with ease, has an easier time with stairs and yesterday broke into a full sprint for the first time in ages! We followed the guideline for her size as listed on the back of the package and have been so surprised by the results. We love Zuke's!

review/summary: Soft, Chewable, Yummy Treats for Your Aging/Arthritic Dog
review/text: I buy these for my nine year old Chihuahua. He has bad knees, hips, and back. He also has lost the majority of his teeth due to former owners who neglected his dental health. He loves these and they seem to help him a lot. When I pull out the bag, he starts doing his tricks hoping I'll give him one just for doing them! He can eat them easily even without the majority of his teeth, although I do break them into smaller pieces since he is only about 5 pounds.<br />These treats seem to have really improved his mobility and stamina. He skips less(to get his kneecap back in place), bunny hops less(because his hips hurt him), and jumps on the bed without any help(he used to stand on the top of his pet stairs and wait for me to pick him up). He's always had tons of energy, but now his body can keep up with him better.

review/summary: Fixed My Dogs Hip
review/text: I rescued my havanese dog from a breeder who was going to put her down for a hip deformity. Turns out the hip was fine but the ball on her leg bone was broken sometime when she was a puppy. It caused her immense pain when moved in certain positions and caused her to limp. Running fast was out of the question and jumping was only for the lowest of heights. Even when she sat her left leg would be out to the side at an awkward angle. She was stuck in a catch 22. She couldn't make it stronger because it hurt and it hurt because it was so weak.<br /><br />We tried glucosamine supplements, but they were powdery and she seemed to not like the taste. The chicken jerky with glucosamine all seemed to be from china with an FDA advisory for liver and kidney problems.<br /><br />That's when I found Zukes hip action. The first time I opened the package the dog danced on her hind legs just to get a better sniff. The squares are soft and dense. They split into smaller pieces easily for training or to extend the reward time. The dog is sure to find even the smallest crumb. These treats last a long time with a small/medium sized dog like mine.  The bag makes a satisfying crinkle sound the dogs listens for. I really like that they are high quality and made in America.<br /><br />The improvement began immediately and after a few weeks of daily treats the difference was in the use of her hind leg was amazing. More cushion and flex in her hip let her use her leg more. Now she is much more active with better behavior and lots more running and jumping. She even sits down with both legs under her. Another thing I noticed was when she would lay in her bed on her back her bad leg would be pulled in. Now both legs spread out like normal for easier tummy rubs. When she is being silly she even army crawls. I only wish we had found them sooner. If you saw this dog running around you would never know she had a hip problem in the past.

Couldn't get my dogs to eat them (one of them usually eats anything).  I have no problem getting my dogs to eat the Zuke's Hip Action Natural Dogs Treats.  I've noticed a slight improvement in their movement.  Haven't been using the product that long so it will be good to see how their movement improves over time.

review/text: My dogs love these treats.  I've been giving them these treats for several years now.  They go nuts when they know they are going to get one, and my vet recommends the supplements for them as they get older.  They are a bit pricey, but I think they are worth it.  Much better now that Amazon is carrying them directly.  I can also say that the manufacturer stands by their products 100%.  I used to buy these in a 3 pack from a 3rd party seller here on Amazon.  On my last shipment, it was very noticeable that in all 3 bags, the treats were very hard and brittle, despite being well before the use by date printed on the bag and the packaging being intact (no holes).  I emailed the manufacturer, and within just a few days they shipped me 3 new bags without any hassle.  Now that is Customer Service!

review/summary: I like them. My dog doesn't like them so much.lol.
review/text: I have an 8 year old female German Shepherd. Lately I have been noticing she has a bit of a difficult time getting up and her hips always seem to be stiff.<br />Since I don't know anything about dog vitamins, I decided to take the route of these treats. I would much rather give her something she might possibly like over giving her a pill.<br /><br />Thing is, she doesn't really like these very much. I usually have to try 2 or 3 times to get her to eat. Bright side is that I can get her to eat them after a little hassle.<br /><br />The even brighter side to these treats (and the reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3) is the fact that they do seem to be helping her stiff joints. I have only gone through one 6 oz bag of these treats and I have noticed a difference in how she stands up, walks and runs. For the first time in a while her legs don't look so stiff.<br /><br />P.S. you can get these treats cheaper on Linens and Things website(LNT.COM). You don't have to pay shipping. I paid 12.21 for a pound of these treats.

review/summary: Best way to give glucosamine that I've found
review/text: My dog loves these treats. I love how much more fun it is to give him glucosamine and chondroitin in a treat instead of in a pill or a liquid. These are pretty affordable, too. They also travel fairly well, and they are soft enough to break in half if you only want to give half of a treat.<br /><br />The only possible problem is that I worry about giving my dog too many of these a day. The package does have guidelines for how many treats to give per day based on your dog's weight. But so far "over-medicating" has not been a problem (especially if you break them in half).<br /><br />I've been really amping up my dog's walks and runs to get ready for hiking this spring, and so far he's not only limp-free, but the stiffness he used to get just after a nap seems to be significantly reduced. All in all, we're both really happy with these. I'll be buying them again, and I'll be trying out more of Zuke's other treats.

I love that these are made in the USA and part of the profits are donated to the Dog and Cat Research Fund.  These are just a win-win-win all around for us!<br /><br />Almost for got to mention....she loves them!

review/text: Boppy gets overly excited when Rodan (grey crane) flies up from the creek, or a squirrel raids the bird feeder.  She has torn her ACL more than once - when she takes off at top speed.  So I now get her treats with glucosamine - so much easier than trying to get a pill in her.  She like the chicken flavor best - she tried beef too.  I like that it is made in the USA.  She does much better with her hips and joints - vet tells me it is really her knee that has ACL problems.  Zukes has a great product here that I like to give her, and she enjoys the good-for-her treat.

review/summary: Very good and healthy treat
review/text: These are great dog treats that are made with natural ingredients and my dogs love them.  I give them these treats to provide the Glucosamine needed especially for my larger dogs.  They get a very good grain free dog food but it does not contain glucosamine and my older dog needs it. Zuke's Hip Action really seems to help her. I have brought this item for several years and highly recommend it.

review/summary: My dog loves these!
review/text: My dog loves these treats, I typically try to give one a day but with all the other treats she get's often a day or two is missed.  No worry as long as you supplement the desired ingredients for hip/joint in other products or food.  The treats are soft and good for dog's of all ages, no choking worries.  The nice thing about Zukes is the ingredients list is not a mile long and they don't use meat by-products and you also don't see a lot of strange ingredients that are common in the mass marketed products.

review/summary: Smells awful, dogs love it!
review/text: The vet recommended glucosamine/chondroitin for the terriers to help with arthritis and knee problems. I can really tell the difference in my 11-year old dog. They love the flavor of these bites which have a strong meaty smell.

review/summary: Best Deal for GREAT treats!
review/text: Zukes Hip Action are great treats for our dogs. Our Lab/Shep mix was already having hip troubles at 5yr. old when we found these treats. He LOVES these and is running around like a pup! Thank you Amazon for selling these at such a great deal. We would have paid about $20 for one bag (2 bags for just under $40) and here we got 3 bags for the same price!

review/summary: Great supplement that my dog asks for
review/text: My elderly lab suffers from arthritis.  Her pain is greatly diminished by taking glucosamine and chondroitin.  Unfortunately she is not a fan of the gravy, chewable tablets or pill forms.  Hip Action has been a fantastic find because she actually wants her meds.  You can set a clock by her these days at 8 pm she goes into the kitchen and stares at the cupboard where we store the Hip Action and waits for her two treats.

review/summary: Great for all dogs!
review/text: Our older dog has arthritis in his right hip.  These had good recommendations so I purchased for him.  He loves them!  Our retriever is younger but I've given them to him also just as a preventative.

review/text: My dogs love these treats!  They get one after they take their medicine, and there's no problem at all getting them to swallow their pills as long as I have the jar of Zuke's out when I call them over.

review/summary: Really helps mobility
review/text: I bought these treats for my 16 year olo husky/beagle mix dog. Within two weeks she showed a visible improvement in mobility and seemed to be pain free. She has pretty bad arthritis and these seem to be working very well. The only issue is they are a semi soft treat so they were all pretty broken and in a big lump in the bag. But other than that they are a great product.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I was first introduced to Zuke's at the Health Expo in Anaheim.  They were kind enough to give me samples to take home to my dog.  Firstly, she loves them and she's picky.  Secondly, it seems to help her Arthritis.

review/summary: Great value and great taste
review/text: My dog has a fairly sensitive stomach and is a VERY picky eater, so I'm usually quite careful with trying new treats. But he loved the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H0ZJHW">Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces</a>, so I thought I might as well give Hip Action a try. And he loved them!<br />They are also a great value - I actually took the time and counted the number of treats in a 1 lb bag - and I got 64, which means more than 2 months of hip protection for dogs under 46 lb (you only need to give one a day).

review/summary: Our favorite treat from Zuke's
review/text: I have been buying this product since sep 2010.  My dog loves this the most.  He sometimes refuses other treats but never this.  So it must be good.  It comes in one and a half inch squares.  It's a little big for us so we cut into smaller, bite-size pieces that are great for training.  We are still young so can't comment on the hip action part yet. I just want to give my dog a good quality treat and I think this is worth the price.

review/summary: Our dog loved them
review/text: Got these to help perk-up our "Olden Golden."  She loved them.  Seemed to help a little.  But, I guess there's no cure for age.<br /><br />This is a far better way to get your dog to take glucosamine and chondroitin.  We had the hardest time getting her to take a pill.<br /><br />I will note that the treats get stale pretty quickly if you don't seal the bag well (it's ziplock.)
