review/summary: Kind of a orange bubblegum flavor, not super fizzy BUT very good!
review/text: I used to live in Scotland when I was younger and this stuff was everywhere.  There is a company in america that sells the stuff called Great Scot, but it's very expensive after shipping.  When I found the 6-packs on amazon for about $1.35/bottle I ordered a pack just for nostalgia.  After not having this stuff for over 15 years I have been dreaming of it often, and now that I've had it again I will definitely be ordering more.  I wish it wasn't only available through subscribe & save, they must have a limited quantity available because I can't even request an extra supplemental shipment after signing up.  This stuff has a nice bubble gum flavor without a very strong fizziness, not really an orange flavored soda but it's very unique and therefore hard to properly describe.  I highly recommend people who are really into soda variety check it out, this is pretty much the Coca Cola of Scotland... Their old slogan when I was a kid over there was: Made in scotland, from girders!  Definitely worth looking into, thanks for having it amazon you're the best!

review/summary: Not awful at all
review/text: My coworker who has a Scottish fiancee was reading a Reddit thread where people were posting their favorite national products of their home country -- the Scots overwhelmingly chose Irn-Bru. My coworker said that he had tried it while visiting Scotland and it was the most vile soda on Earth, with a taste out of hell, a sickening combination of burning hatred and battery acid. I was intrigued and ordered this six pack the next minute (eventus stultorum magister right??). When these showed up, there was a note on the label that exhorted the soon-to-be-quaffer to chill the drink before consumption, which I took seriously as I prepared to drink my liquid hate. Finally the time came - I grasped the bottle, wincingly angled it back and... it was pretty good! Sweet, a bit citrus-y, a bit bubble gummy -- in fact, it tastes just like an orange-colored Mitsuya Cider if you know Japanese sodas.. or maybe a Chilsung Cider if you know Korean ones. My coworker is a total liar. I gave him one of bottles from this six pack and he conceded that it wasn't horrible in the slightest. I don't know what practical joke his future in-laws played on him when he was in Scotland, because he sure wasn't drinking this Irn-Bru.

review/summary: Odd - But Refreshing
review/text: I recently got my order of this in the mail the other day, and I must say this is quite good!  It has an odd after taste, but this citrus soda from Scotland is really something I could get used to! It's hard to describe the taste, but despite its' carbonation, the drink does go down smooth. It almost has a beer like aftertaste, but it's very good. Much different than soda found in the United States. I suggest anyone willing to give it a try, buy a case (or a single bottle). It's worth the exploration!

review/text: Irn-Bru is an acquired taste, but it's refreshing and lighter than most U.S. soda's.  You won't feel nearly as over-whelmed with corn-syrup/sugar... and lets' face it, it's fun to have a soda unknown to your friends and family.  Pricing here is great especially for an imported beverage like Bru!  Also, do yourself a favor and check out the Iron Bru commercials, quite humorous.

review/summary: Great Candy, Bad Wrapper
review/text: Mary Jane used to have an easy to remove wrapper with two twisted ends which made it easy to pull open and pop as many as you wanted in your mouth. But now nooooooo...they are so tightly wrapped and stuck to the candy that you have to use your nails to pick off the wrapper in pieces and sometimes you miss a piece which ends up in your mouth. And now there are smaller pieces anyway so you have to unwrap more often. Whoever came up with this new wrapper should be fired. Maybe Weight Watchers recommended it because you burn more calories in frustration than you get from the candy. Hey geniuses, when you have a nostalgic candy your selling DON"T SCREW WITH IT IN ANY WAY!

review/text: Somen is meant to eat cold. You use 1/2 cold water, 1/2 memmi sauce with wasabi, grated ginger and scallions, and you dip the somen in it. It's like cold soba noodles. This is the best type of somen you can purchase in bulk. You just boil water, put the somen in for about 3 to 4 mins and rinse with cold water, serve over ice. Don't get these if you don't know how to cook them or you may not like it. This isn't a replacement for angel hair pasta. Obviously you'll have to remove the paper ring around the noodles...that's just common sense and not worth a 4 star rating (from the other reviewer).

review/text: I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)

It didn't tell me anything I didn't know about Tiger Stadium. If you get it, you'll probably watch it once, maybe a second time 10 years later after you forgot you had it, but I doubt you'll watch it more than that. Entertaining enough to see it once, probably not much more value beyond that. I would've given it 2 1/2 stars if that was possible.

review/summary: A young vigorous Islay with a huge flavor profile but also a sweet and wooded side.
review/text: Jim McEwan has really shaken up the whiskey world in his decade or so at Bruichladdich.  Rocks is one of his new products, along with Peat, and Waves.  Peat is smokey peat monster.  Waves is buttery fat and sweet.  Rocks strides between and manages to be something unique and something, in my opinion, very true to the original aspect of Bruichladdich:  a sweeter, fruitier, more harmonious take on briny iodiny smokey Islay malt.<br /><br />In the glass, Rocks is golden with a lovely peachy rosy glow.  Rocks is aged for several months in French red wine casks which McEwan says accounts for the color.  Aroma is delicate and dry with iodine, pork rind, dry oats, maritime brine, and a mineral tang.  It smells like rocks on the sea shore.  First sip shows a huge and unexpected (from the nose) explosion of honeyed cereal sugars with a midpalate expansion of oak vanilla, blackberry, and red fruits.  The finish is long with smoky notes and anthracite char joining the honeyed cereal sugar red fruit medley with some oak resin tannins unfolding at the very end.  It's a beguiling flavor profile, reminiscent of the Port Charlotte PC6-8 monsters, but less intense (and minus the peat), less proof, and far less expensive.  It captures a measure of their intensity of flavor and maritime brine meets honeyed malt splendor.  There's no age on Rocks' label.  McEwan says its a blend of young single malts ranging from 6-9 years old.  That's another way it's like the Port Charlotte offerings.<br /><br />Rocks quickly became a favorite for me and the first bottle went quickly.  Shopper's Vineyard recently dropped the price and quickly got more.  This is very reasonably priced for the quality.  This is the everyday drinking version of the big Port Charlotte salty-sweet Islays from Bruichladdich.

This chai is a nice alternative to my morning cup of coffee. It's rich and spicy, and caffiene free. It's a bit high on the sugar, but not so bad as some other chai I looked at, and I just have one cup in the morning. If you like the spiciness of chai I would recommend this brand. The six-pack was a good option, as I keep a container at work and another at home.

Each foray into rice pasta has been a gummy heap of disappointment, really. I bought this pasta because it looked interesting, but didn't expect to enjoy it...<br /><br />OMG!!! We have pasta back! I just boiled some up with some salt and a splash of EVOO and my son and I were eating it plain... The flavor, texture, appearance was all very appealing. I'm excited to try more of Mrs Leeper's corn pasta - rotini and radiatore are next :)<br /><br />I had a favorite pasta-diced chicken-artichoke hears-kalamata olives-greek dressing salad that I miss so much - and I will go straight out and buy more of Mrs Leeper's pasta so I can try making it with corn pasta.<br /><br />I'll be cooking up more of the corn spaghetti as a non-sticky take-along finger food. I am SOOOO happy!!

review/summary: Tastes like regular pasta
review/text: We've tried so many different brands of gluten-free pasta since my husband was diagnosed with celiac disease last year. Mrs. Leeper's is the best tasting thus far. It has the same al dente bite and taste of regular pasta. I can finally make dinner and not have my husband wear that disappointed look on his face like he's missing out. He loved his Barilla, but this tastes just as good!

review/summary: Gluten free pasta alternative
review/text: I prefer this pasta to the brown rice pasta for gluten free pasta. The corn pasta holds its form much better than brown rice. If you need a pasta that is gluten free I highly recommend this product. Mrs. Leepers makes many different shaped gluten free pastas that you can't find in the grocery store.

review/summary: Mrs. Leeper's Pasta Organic Gluten Free Corn Spaghetti
review/text: These are amazing and unable to consistently find in the Atlanta area . . . so rather than continue driving around looking for them, I found them at Amazon.com.  Thanks Amazon - and Mrs. Leeper's!  I prefer corn spaghetti over rice and this brand is THE BEST.  Only other tip to offer, let water boil VERY HOT with a smidge of oil before dropping pasta in and there will be no sticking.  Also, other brands may break down while leftover in the fridge if mixed with other ingredients.  Mrs. Leeper's won't!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: A year ago I was diagnosed with allergies to wheat and gluten, among other things.  After trying brown rice pasta and a few other kinds, I went back to eating the regular stuff.  I bought a package of Mrs. Leeper's and had it in my cupboard for quite a while.  But whenever I'd make my husband's favorite pasta, with white clam sauce, I'd be afraid to "ruin" the dish by using gluten free pasta... and it was just too much work to make two different kinds, so I'd just eat the regular stuff and deal with the allergy symptoms.<br /><br />My husband went out of town so I decided to try the Mrs. Leeper's while he was gone.  I was VERY pleasantly surprised at how delicious it is!!  I am confident that I could use it in my hubby's favorite dish, not tell him that it's GF, and he would never even know the difference.<br /><br />I had to cook it slightly longer than the package directions... it was still a bit too hard.  I like my pasta al dente but not raw.  I think I cooked it a minute or two longer than the directions called for.  I also didn't rinse it... just drained it and threw it in with the sauce I had going in a different pan.  It held up very well to being added to sauce, and the extra minute of heating and tossing (unlike all the other GF pastas I've tried, which turned into 1/2" pieces of gloop when I did that).  The pasta retained its form and texture throughout the eating phase as well.  There would be nothing to indicate that it was not "regular" pasta.<br /><br />One thing... I did have a SLIGHT allergic reaction to it... a histamine kind of thing.  The ingredients say "100% organic corn flour" and that is all.  But what do they use to bind it together?  The word "flour" implies to me that it is ground corn mixed with a blend of other things that make it "flour."  Hopefully they use corn starch, to keep it 100% corn.  But I'm not so sure that corn is the only thing it contains... because I have these types of histamine reactions whenever I "accidentally" consume soy or tapioca.  So I've got a call into World Finer Foods to determine whether there is any other ingredient other than corn.  Of course whenever I call any manufacturer to find out what "hidden ingredients" are in their products, you can never get a true answer.  Especially because this product is from Italy, and you have no way of contacting Mrs. Leeper's directly... every contact link redirects back to World Finer Foods.<br /><br />Let me just say that as a person who suffers from numerous food allergies, our FDA does a very poor job in enforcing disclosure on labels.  I have a potentially deadly allergy to red pepper, and companies don't have to disclose that ingredient.  As long as the ingredient is considered "natural," they can just put "spices" on the ingredients and leave it at that.  This should really be addressed by our legislators.  There are MANY people out here in the good ol' US of A who are allergic to hot pepper flakes, chili powder, paprika, cayenne pepper, garlic, black pepper, and many other "spices."  It's time that we know what's in something when we eat it.  Food manufacturers need to have better disclosure, and be accountable for what they put in their products.  I know that this isn't specifically about this pasta... but it is about the difficulty I'm having in finding out what the "binding" agent is in the corn flour.

review/summary: i am not celiac and i love this spaghetti
review/text: i discovered this pasta while searching for gluten-free alternatives for someone who thought they were celiac (but turned out not to be). i think it tastes better than any wheat-based pasta, except perhaps for some spinach spaghetti i had years ago.<br /><br />the only downside is that cooking requires more activity to prevent the noodles from sticking together. some tricks i've come up with:<br />- boil A LOT of water. so much so that the spaghetti is completely submerged the instant you put it in the pot.<br />- put in a little at a time, about 1/4 of a package, and put it in gently so that you can feel the noodles separate.<br />- stir regularly, about once every 2-3 minutes.<br /><br />one other bit of advice: don't order through amazon unless you're using subscribe and save. each package costs $3 at the market, but the amazon price has shot up this year from $33/12 ($2.75) to almost $39 ($3.25).

review/text: Since discovering this, I can have all the pasta I want again.  Even my husband who doesn't eat gluten free agrees that it tastes and has the texture of 'real' spaghetti.  In fact I think I almost prefer it over wheat pasta if I had the option.  The only downside is 1) You do have to stir it well or else it will become 'glued' together cooking at times and 2) when adding pasta sauce you want to toss it very gentle because corn pasta has the tendency to break up much easier.

review/summary: Better than regular pasta
review/text: When I first had to go gluten free, I really missed pasta.  The rice pasta was mushy and not worth it at all.  I tried this first, and then eventually talked my picky gluten-eating family into trying it.  They actually prefer this to regular pasta because it has a firmer texture and it tastes great with or without sauce (we prefer to toss it with just olive oil and seasonings).  The only bad thing is that it tends to stick together while cooking.  You have to stir it a lot or it will become a stuck together blob, so be careful.  As far as taste and texture, though, it can't be beat.

review/text: My family isn't gluten free, but I bought this on a whim one day to try.  It looks weird cooking and the water gets thick and yellow, but once it's properly drained and seasoned I couldn't tell much of a different from normal pasta.  It has a bit more bite than normal pasta,  but not as much as whole wheat pasta. It wasn't gummy and held up well with sauce. With subscribe and save it comes out much cheaper than I paid in the grocery store (3.79 a pack).  I definitely recommend this to anyone gluten free, or anyone who just wants to try something new.

review/summary: Excellent quality nuts, best taste, packaging fine
review/text: These are the best brazil nuts we have tried! They are large, fresh, sweet-tasting nuts. I like that they are natural, not soaked in oil and coated with salt! Brazil nuts are very healthy and we eat some every day. The price is excellent. All of our containers were intact and tightly sealed. The packaging may not be fancy, but who cares - it is the nuts you are buying! I would not hesitate to include these in a gift basket - just wrap the package in a little sheer fabric tied with a bow. These are a pantry staple for us.

review/summary: Better choice at rate charged per ounce of Brazilian nuts
review/text: Compare the price per ounce before buying your Brazil nuts, this brand is less expensive,less packaging hype since you are buying what is inside the package and not some package appearance.<br />Other brands listed at Amazon are presumed to not taste any better since they all are imported from same sources anyways.<br />My advice buy this brand even though packaging looks alittle plain.

They tasted fresh and flavorful with a very pleasant texture -- much better than the ones I bought from two local stores. The air-tight packaging ensured no spillage.

Congratulations and thanks to Amazon for making this good quality product available. I recommend this item to anyone who likes Brazil nuts.

review/summary: Delicious, but strange
review/text: These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.

review/summary: Amazing service.
review/text: I guess I should focus on the product more than the company, but I can't help it!  I started thinking it would be smart to buy bulk, whole spices online since it's cheaper and more efficient.  So, I noticed Whole Spice here on Amazon and decided to go with them!<br /><br />The nutmeg I purchased is great!  It arrived in less than one week, packaged very well, and the glass bottle the nutmeg is held in is clearly very thick and durable.  Not to mention, the label is even pretty - always a bonus!  :)<br /><br />The 1.1 oz bottle has about 8-10 nuts that were all a very good size.  I'm almost sure it could last me a lifetime.  So, the price of this product is obviously a good deal, and from experience, much cheaper than most grocery stores (including mega-stores, like Walmart.)

review/summary: Way too salty, and flavor is just ok.
review/text: My biggest complaint with this flavor of Zatarain's is the amount of sodium it contains. The Nutrition Facts on the box says it has 980mg per serving, which is equivalent to a whopping 41% of the Percent Daily Values. That's PER SERVING, of about 5 servings per box. That's just way too much salt... by comparison, the regular Zatarain's Jambalaya Mix contains only about half the sodium. Even when I added more meat(I used chicken instead of ground beef as suggested), the dish still came out too salty. I finally decided that in order to make this mix more edible, I had to discard about one-third to one-half of the seasonings. The seasonings come all clumped together anyway so it wasn't difficult to separate it from the rice before cooking.<br /><br />In terms of flavor, I wasn't too impressed either. The seasoning is basically chicken bouillon cubes with some spices, like oregano and basil. Not terrible, but not terribly inventive either.<br /><br />So, with apologies to the three 5-star reviews that came before mine, I do not recommend this product. To each his own, I guess.

review/summary: If you have never had bean threads, try these
review/text: I bought these on a whim and then cooked them up with a chicken stir-fry when I realized that I was out of the brown rice I usually use.  Let's set the record straight first, though.  These are NOT good for you, as another poster claimed.  I bought them without looking at the ingredients and thought, hmm... noodles made from beans.  Healthy!  Then I realized that they are made from bean starch, potato starch, and water.  I don't know where I fall on the whole "starch is bad for you" issue (I'd have to do more research) but if you religiously avoid starch, you won't want to use these.  From my point of view, though, the worst I can say regarding their nutrition is that they are pretty much devoid of nutritional value.<br /><br />But now for the good stuff... I know these are common in certain cuisines, but I had never before had them.  They are very interesting - glossy and translucent, with a distinct gelatinous quality.  They basically look like clear gelatin extruded into noodle shape, but they hold together.  This texture can take some getting used to, as gelatinous texture is one texture, in particular, which Westerners are not used to and don't like (except for Jello, of course.)  But, they absorb pretty much any flavor and I have found that if I make a stir-fry one day and refrigerate the leftovers and eat them the next day, these have become very flavorful.  I will definitely keep using them.  If you are looking for a way to change your basic stir-fry, you might try adding your meat and veggies to a base of these bean threads.

review/text: I love bean threads noodles and have been cooking them with dried mushrooms, ground pork and chillies for many years. However, bean threads noodles in Asia are usually thinner than Dynasty SaiFun noodles and they get soft quickily and easily. Dynasty SaiFun noodles are much better because it is slightly thicker and they have a great chewy texture. They are also perfect for making vegetarian spring rolls. That's the reason why I bought 12 packages :)

review/summary: makes a mean pad woon sen
review/text: My favorite Thai restaurant is about an hours' drive away and gas prices being what they are I decided to try and figure out how to make my favorite entree from there, Pad Woon Sen. A couple of youtube videos later I had seen a demonstration of exactly how to make the recipe which includes my favorite element of the dish - the mung bean noodles.<br /><br />I found these Dynasty noodles here on Amazon, gathered the remaining ingredients locally and it was pretty easy from start to finish. The recipe I used comes really close to the dish I've always enjoyed at the restaurant. I've posted the link in the comments section so you can see if you'd like to try this easy, tasty dish too.<br /><br />As per other reviewer's comments, I'd have to agree these noodles are somewhat gelatinous in texture which I happen to like. They also firm, not unlike ordinary al dente pasta. I've had thinner versions of this kind of noodle but I think this is a nice size. Very mild flavor like rice that readily absorbs the taste of the seasoning or sauce it is paired with.<br /><br />This pack of twelve is a really good value; I always check and compare prices first but at the time of my purchase this is a much better deal than I could find locally. One pack has three bundles of noodles and after soaking/cooking, one bundle tends to be more than enough for one person per meal.<br /><br />Prior to ordering I had a small concern that because the noodles fine they may suffer breakage during shipping but as it turns out they shipped very well - double boxed, and all arrived in excellent condition.<br /><br />Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.

Since I sprinkle MSG on their food daily, this product is quite a savings for me (and the vet is the one who endorses use of MSG for this purpose).
