review/summary: Noticable Weight Gain in My Dog After Only 6 Days of Feeding Her This
review/text: My dog was looking a bit on the thin side, and after ruling out any health issues, the vet suggested that I make changes to her diet. I stopped feeding her the junk they sell at the corner deli and switched to this stuff, and within 6 days there was a visible difference in her body weight. I never thought a dog could gain weight like that in less than a week, but my dog really bulked up and does not look thin at all anymore. It's amazing.

review/summary: Holistic Select Dog Food
review/text: I have been feeding my dog Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health Lamb Meal Formula for approximately 4 yrs.  He loves it and, in my view, it is a very healthy dog formula. I purchased this product because my dog had a urinary infection due to crystals in his urine when he was a small pup and my vet suggested I change his diet to a formula with a lower percentage of protein.  My dog has not had any problems since using Holistic Select. I rate this product 5 stars.

review/summary: What the Dogs Choose
review/text: We have been feeding our three dogs Eagle Pack Holistic for almost eight years.  I've never once had a reason to question the integrity of the company or the health benefits from feeding it to my dogs.  Eagle Pack has never recalled any of their foods (even when it seemed like almost every other brand was).  They have a great proof of purchase rewards program.  You can sign up on their website to receive monthly coupons.  My dogs have amazing coats, amazing teeth, and amazing energy.  I don't think that there is a better food that could be recommended.

review/summary: It's a Keeper
review/text: We adopted our dog last summer and have tried various dog foods including the small breed formula from this same company. This is the one that our dog eats the best, and what comes out her other end is the easiest to deal with. No bad breath. Our dog scratches a lot and I was hoping this food would help that, but alas, no.<br /><br />If you sign up at Holistic Select's website they will email you coupons. So far I got one for $5 and one for $3. I don't know how (or if) to use them on amazon so sometimes I buy locally.<br /><br />This is small kibble suitable for small dogs. Don't know about big dogs. The pieces are flattish disks about 3/16" thick and 3/8" or so in diameter. They vary some.

review/text: I can't say enough nice things about Eagle Pack brand dog foods, especially their holistic line.  Cured my dogs of ear problems, hot spots and other intestinal problems quickly and my dogs love the taste.  It does cost a bit more, but well worth it when you factor in expensive vet visits and loss of sleep while the poor dog scratches and scratches while you watch helplessly.  Do yourself and your dog a favor and give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Good food for English bulldog
review/text: We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/text: My little Shiba just can't handle chicken or grain byproducts. I love the ingredients, I love that my dog is enthusiastic about the food and I love that I can buy it on Amazon.com and have it delivered.<br /><br />The tiny kibble is great for smaller mouths but is on the harder side when it comes to dry. I have used pro-plan in the past and notice the shredded mix has much softer/grainy kibble. I sometimes moisten the food with a little bit of pet-friendly topping.<br /><br />The mix is nutrient and calorie dense. You may have to tweak your volume, depending on what you're switching from.

On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.

review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.

Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product.

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/text: I have enjoyed Lapsang Souchong tea for years.  I was expecting a tea that smells like smoke when you open the package. However, when compared side by side with the little bit of old Lapsang I had left, the difference is quite clear; this tea has no smoke smell and a very different flavor profile. It is not a bad tea in and of itself, it just isn't Lapsang Souchong. Thus, I felt I had to give it a 1-star to warn others.

review/summary: A good Halloween treat
review/text: This is a new product.  The 6.5 pound box contains about 250 or the small jelly bean pyramids, and it makes a good trick or treat item.  The price listed is a bit high as I found an alternate source that has a price of $38.16 with free shipping.  Jelly Belly always has some good products available that can be added to treat bags, but the quantity is a bit high and you need to have a lot of trick or treaters (or another large group) to use this quantity - or maybe you just need to really like jelly beans.<br /><br />I ordered these for Halloween and a friend immediately claimed dibs on any I had left.  Small packages of jelly beans are a very popular item.<br /><br />They can also be used as a treat for promotional gifts, party favors, or other happies.

review/summary: So salty they're inedible.
review/text: After reading journal articles about how squash seeds work for depression almost better than medication, I purchased two bags of these squash seeds. Big mistake. It's super salty, and I'm a person who loves their salt and sugar. If I'm calling them super salty, then it's really, really salty. Am not sure how to remedy the salty seeds, cause I hate throwing food away. But in this case, I don't see any way of fixing this.<br /><br />I will not buy again.

review/summary: A huge improvement on the BBQ flavor snack category. Bravo Nabisco!
review/text: As an avid snacker throughout my 52 years, I've come to despise BBQ flavored anything especially in snacks. I even hate the taste of BBQ sauce and never put it on smoked or barbecued meats. Sugar on steak is an abomination on the flavor of meat except for some oriental dishes.<br /><br />But Nabisco has come up with one of the most unique tasting BBQ flavors I've ever come across. It's truly SMOKY tasting which is the one flavor that's missing in all BBQ flavored variety of snacks and even most BBQ sauces. It's also very fresh tasting with no stale or fake overtones in the aftertaste as is the case I've found with most BBQ flavored snacks which usually left me with a kind of slight reflux like heartburn. Wheat Thins Smoky BBQ doesn't do this.<br /><br />Please, Nabisco, don't discontinue this line of Wheat Thins and that goes for Zesty Salsa and Spicy Buffalo or else you'll lose me as a customer. I'm not a fan of plain Wheat Thins.

review/text: I regularly make flax muffins and also mix ground flaxmeal in my Greek yogurt or use it in my meatball recipe, etc.  Bob's Red Mill Golden Flaxseed Meal is a very consistently fine meal, with a delicate taste, and an extended expiration date.  And there is no better price out there than on amazon.com--will definitely continue to buy it here.

review/summary: Golden Flax Seed is sweet and nutty tasting, NOT bitter!
review/text: GOLDEN flax seed meal is never bitter or gritty, and Bobs Red Mill is the finest quality! We add it to ALL baking and everyone loves it. Example: We use this meal INSTEAD OF FAT in muffins and they are moist and delicious! For instance, if the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of oil, we substitute 1/2 cup of golden flax seed meal. Its that simple. The muffins (regardless of the type) turn out tasty and stay fresh for days! This is a MUCH better fatty fiber than any other you could add to baking. Plus, golden flax seed meal SATISFIES! You will require less food when you eat it. PLEASE NOTE - something seldom mentioned about FLAX - it is a laxative! - so add it to your diet slowly, or you may regret it. Flax calms your appetite, aids digestion, fills you up, regulates your bowels, gives STAMINA, and is a great source of Omega III fatty acids, among other things. It adds more value to your diet, naturally, than anything else you've ever tried! Your health will improve SO much after a few weeks of using this meal, you will never stop using it! For Bob's Organic see: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EDK5MG">Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a>, Recommended!

review/summary: Pleasant taste, nice smell...works great in my smoothies!
review/text: I ordered these for my protein shakes to add omega-3 and fiber. I'd never used flaxseed meal before, so I was worried, but the reviews here were go good, I risked the 4-pack with the S&S savings offer.<br /><br />Lovely. Been using it 2 to 3 times a day for my between meal whey/almond milk/flax shakes. The flax has a mild flavor that makes my smoothies lightly reminniscent of malted and wheat shakes my dad made me as a kid.<br /><br />I avoid gluten/malt nowadays, so this is a nice addition to my supplementary nutrients.<br /><br />I need to see how else to work it into my diet, as I cannot eat seafood or take krill or fish oils (allergic), and this is an easy way to add the good omega to my intake.<br /><br />Thanks to all who reviewed it previously. Made it easier for me to take the plunge. :D

review/text: This stuff is truly amazing.  I've been making flax buns with the other brown flaxseed meal from Bob's for a while and they are very good.  This stuff, however, makes them the correct color which makes them taste eleventy billion times better to me.  I truly do think there is a taste improvement, but the color is the main difference. I'll never bake with brown flaxseed meal again.<br /><br />Flax bun recipe you say?  Way simple:<br /><br />3/4 cup flaxseed meal<br />4 Tbsp butter (could use olive oil here instead)<br />1.5 tsp baking powder<br />2 drops EZ-Sweets (or 1.5 tsp splenda)<br />0.5 tsp salt<br />2 large eggs<br />1/5 cup of water<br /><br />1. mix dry ingredients while melting butter<br />2. Add in wet ingredients and whisk into dry.<br />3. Put in Muffin Top pan (crucial), bake at 350 for 15 minutes.<br /><br />Makes 6 pieces.<br />=151 calories and 0.3 Net Carbs per piece.<br /><br />They are unbelievably good as either sandwich / burger bread or with cream cheese and sugar free strawberry jelly on top.

review/text: I am diabetic, and as part of an ongoing effort to avoid insulin I have adopted a low-carbohydrate diet. Bob's Red Mill Flaxseed Meal has been an excellent part of that diet: as the major component in "one-minute muffins" it has allowed me to enjoy a hot, filling and quick breakfast at times when I don't want to go to the trouble of frying up some eggs and bacon. High in protein, fat and fiber, it's become an essential staple in my kitchen.

Bob's Red Mill was recommended to me over 5 years ago and has always provided top-quality products at reasonable prices. I used to order from them through their own online store before finding out they sold their products through Amazon. You won't find everything here, but whatever you do find will have the best prices on here. I haven't received a bad product from these guys/gals. Highly recommended.

review/summary: High Quality My Dog Enjoys and My Budget Does Too!
review/text: My doggie really likes Newman's Organic better than some other dog foods pet and big-box stores sell. My budget doesn't like Newman's Organic as much as Harmony Farms. It's the compromise that keeps the doggie AND my budget happy.  Because he eats it heartily, I don't worry that he's getting enough high quality food.  Otherwise he won't eat his food and he'll graze in the trash seeking egg shells and bones to fill the void.<br /><br />There's no barfing, digestion problems or accidents. High Quality food means good digestion, a shiny coat, high energy, bright eyes and a good attitude WITHOUT tons of additional elixers, treats or vet bills. A definite cost effective WIN:WIN for doggie AND me.<br /><br />I've had great results with Newman's Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon BUT there's 5 pounds LESS for about the same price.<br /><br />Psst I'm not an organic fanatic, it's the nutritional value that counts for my fur baby and human kids!<br /><br />Update 3/26/2011: Noticed this has jumped to almost THIRTY BUCKS, will opt for Newman's Organic when the costs per pound are the same...my dog likes BOTH Harmony and Newman, my budget likes the one most cost effective at the time of purchase :)<br /><br />Update 5/17/2012: Last batch Of Harmony Farms I ordered had a rancid oil smell when I opened the bag and the pooch wouldn't eat it as readily as he has in the past. He wouldn't eat for a day and started checking out the trash. I subsequently purchased some canned and pouch foods, cooked brown rice etc as mix-ins to "encourage" him to make it through this pricey bag. Not sure how this is stored before it arrives to my home, BUT the Texas heat can make anything stale/rancid/yucky quickly. I probably should have called Customer Service but felt the replacement would have the same issue due to the HOT weather here. Definitely exploring hot weather alternatives.

review/summary: This is great dog food!
review/text: A few years back, prompted by the death of one of our dogs due to an inoperable brain tumor, I switched my dogs to foods without corn.  I was convinced, right or wrong, that my animal died needlessly because of an over usage of steriods prescribed to cure her constant ear infections.  I believe, again right or wrong, that the recurring ear infections were caused by an allergy to corn...which turned out to be the main ingredient in her food!  Sorry, I'll get off my soapbox and address the issue at hand...I found this food by accident.  The only type the store had was the weight loss formula.  Turns out my dogs love it!  I haven't seen them so spunky and full of energy.  I've got a coon hound and two jack russells (mine are not the "bounce off the wall kind", mine are mellow, laid back kinda dudes!)  They gobble this stuff up and seem to stay full...no more begging in the kitchen than normal! Everyone's skin seems smoother, eyes are brighter, heck, I think I'll go have a bowl!  All I can say, is if you are looking for a good quality dog food, this is the one for you.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!

review/summary: I would give Harmony Farms extra stars if I could!
review/text: I have a 2 year old Portuguese Water Dog who always seemed to have a sensitive stomach, and a 15 year old Shepherd X dog who was beginning to lose weight, she slept almost all the time, and she was getting very fussy about what she'd eat. (I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: My co-worker that does animal rescue brought in a 'Whole Dog Journal' recently and I was astounded at the feature article for that month which covered dog foods, I had been feeding my dog Beneful which is basically just junk food.  I switched her off immediately, hunted around on Amazon to find an all natural food and this fit the bill, shipping was free which was awesome and my dog LOVES the food, I worried about that b/c I've switched her before and she's been uninterested and I've had to top with gravy, etc.<br /><br />Do your research, it will blow your mind what your pets are eating in regular grocery store dog food, it's typically a high ratio of corn which is a filler.  If you want your pet to live a long and healthy life what they're ingesting should be high up on your list.  I'm glad to have the knowledge now and I really wish I'd looked more into this with my two other dogs years and years ago.

review/summary: Quality dog food delivered to your door!
review/text: No more heavy grocery bags for me -- I've just ordered my first bag of Harmony Farms dog food -- and it was delivered to my door by UPS.  The food is excellent quality -- I bought this product based on its healthy ingredients; the dogs love it and I love Amazon for making it so easy to buy!<br /><br />July 2010 - one of my dogs has had bouts of inflammatory bowel disease:  previously she had to have special food from my vet (Royal Canaan Duck & Potato for the past 4+years) -- She has tolerated, even thrived on, the Harmony Farms food w/o any problems. Each bag of Harmony Farms is about $20 cheaper than the Royal Canaan.  Hard to fight.  I am a believer.<br /><br />The canned food is great, too.<br /><br />September 2011 -- my dog who has had inflammatory bowel disease in the past (verified by surgery) has never felt better -- she is a wire and has the energy of a 2 yr old dog (she is 7); she is not on any daily medication.  This HEALTHY WEIGHT FORMULA has helped her to thrive.  Enough protein, not too much fat seem to do the trick. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Didn't do well for my dog
review/text: I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.

review/summary: The Cat likes it, too!
review/text: I was using Castor and Pollux from Amazon for my dog and I decided to try something different.  My dog dug into this dog food right away!  It has helped to maintain her rough coat so that it is softer and smoother.  And this food really helps keep her weight at a healthy level.<br /><br />I catch my cat sneaking over to my dog's food bowl and eating this food, too.  I have to look into getting her some Harmony Farms!  I can do this because Harmony Farms is really good quality food that is affordable.

review/summary: Passed the taste test!
review/text: Everyone should know this is a healthier dog food than walmart brands, like purina, iams, or god forbid moist & meaty. Ingredients like ground flax seed, peas, whole carrots, whole sweet potatoes, apples, blueberries and probiotics and the lack of sweeteners, by-products, and low-quality corn show this to be true.<br /><br />I just did a taste test with this harmonic farms and my dogs old iams ProActive Health and decided to make the results known. I let him smell both thoroughly without letting him eat at first, and placed the two piles a bit apart. He immediately went for the harmonic farms, finished it and didn't even look at the iams before coming back to me wagging his tail hoping for more.<br /><br />Dogadvisor.com made me aware of my past mistakes in dog food choices and I was hoping to god he would not shy away from the healthy organic stuff like I do. To my great welcome surprise, he didn't! I guess he's a hippie at heart. I on the other hand, will take my nachos bell grande.

review/summary: Excellent for Wheaten Terrier's Sensitive Tummies!
review/text: Harmony Farms produces EXCELLENT dog food products!  Our 8 month soft-coated wheaten terrier is sensitive to gluten, corn meal and other products generally found in the popular  brands.  We were preparing to take him to the vet at about 4 months old b/c he had great difficulty eliminating -- to the point of whining as he would attempt to go.  After more research on the breed we purchased Harmony Farms at a local store -- it was expensive but quickly resolved our puppy's digestive issues.  After 5-8 days on only Harmony Farms products our puppy was happy and healthy!<br /><br />I was so happy to find Harmony Farms on Amazon!  It is more economical AND delivered right to our door.  Our puppy, Connor, eats only Harmony Farms dog food and treats and is a much happier puppy now. Definitely recommend it for soft-coated wheaten terriers and other breeds that have difficulty digesting the popular brands.

review/text: Wish I would have known a long time ago what a difference this dog food makes. My 6 year old Jack Russell has always had the worst shedding problem and I recently read that excessive is a sign of poor nutrition (was feeding her P*urina dog chow). She's only been on this dog food for two weeks and I can noticeably tell a difference in the shedding! She loves the taste and I love the price for such a good quality dog food.

review/text: The main ingredients in this dog food are so much better than the ingredients in the common grocery store brands, and it tends to be less expensive than specialty brands.  My dog's coat looks shiny and he seems much healthier since we switched to this food about a year ago.  The other nice thing is that Target sells this brand, so if you ever find yourself at the end of the bag and you haven't ordered more in time, you can stop by Target.

review/text: I have purchased this product once before from Amazon.  It was delivered promptly and in tact.  This is the only food our dog will eat and we used to purchase it at PetSmart in New York but in Arizona, it is no where to be found.  This food is holistic and has no unnatural products at all.  We try to give our dog good quality dog food and this was it.  So now we go through Amazon and our dog is quite happy.  Bought a double amount to receive free shipping.  It was a very good deal.

review/summary: Both formulas are excellent for my dogs!
review/text: I have a nearly 1 year old golden retriever/standard poodle mix, and a 6 year old german shepherd. The doodle gets the chicken and  brown rice (just switched her a few weeks ago from Nutro Max) and the shepherd gets the healthy weight. I have tried several different foods for the doodle, and many of them caused problems like diarrhea and stinky, stinky farts. With this, while switching from the Nutro Max, she had none of those problems. In fact, I only took 5 days to switch her instead of 2 or so weeks, and she didn't have any digestive problems. Both dogs seem to like it and it is definitely cost effective... several dollars cheaper at my local Wegman's and there are always coupons in the paper. This is a very high quality food for the price, and I like that it's available at the grocery store as I live in a small town. I highly recommend this food and hope to feed it exclusively for as long as my doggies shall live!

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: I purchased this because of the good reviews and the great ingredients. No doubt about the quality of the food and my 5 month old dachuhund puppy loves it. But I realized this doesn't have DHA that helps to develop cognitive brain function. Also the kibble might be little big for a puppy. So I believe it's a great food for an adult dog, but I wouldn't recommend it for a puppy.

review/text: Since I live in a rural area sometimes I'd drive to town just for dog food...needless to say that was expensive.  For $26 w/free-shipping the Harmony Farms is cheaper than the purchasing the lower quality "name-brands" - my dog likes the food and his skin is not as dry & flaky. I love getting it shipped directly and that my dog is eating something healthy.  Very thankful it's something I can afford as well.  Only wish Amazon offered a 'subscription service' for this item like they do on others.

It has cut her gas down and has been so easy on her stomach. It also tastes so good to her that she will eat it without wet food mixed in. I wish I had found this food 11 years ago. It is great and we will switch our Boxer puppy to it when it is time. Also...very affordable:)

review/summary: The best food for dogs!
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky.

review/summary: Solved 2 different digestive issues for 2 different dogs!
review/text: I have 2 husky/shepherd mixes. The first is 13 months and has a finicky stomach - if he eats too fast, drinks too fast, or eats anything out of his routine, he would bring it back up. He also wouldn't eat more than a few nibbles at a time. The 2nd is 7 months old and came to us with severe diarrhea (vet's food didn't fix it either). He would eat anything and everything if we let him. Within a day of both dogs being on Harmony Farms (No fasting, just a quick switch), both dogs digestive issues are gone. My oldest (the finicky eater) is healthily eating his meals without pause or hesitation. My youngest has solid, regular bathroom breaks and has been able to relax his water intake as a result. They're both more relaxed.<br />We purchase at our local grocery store (Hannaford here in NY) for about $1.31/lb. For the price, ingredients, and results - you can't beat it.

review/text: Like other reviewers, these are most enjoyable to me.  Until fairly recently, the 1-lb 14-oz container was available at a great price from our local warehouse club.  Today however, only the chocolate flavor and in some stores for the holidays the gingerbread flavor is available.  I do enjoy these but the "Originali" is my runaway favorite.  The sources for the 1-lb 14-oz container show prices 40% higher than the warehouse club, and then you have to add unreasonable shipping amounts.  So the deal now is the 12-pack of boxes of 8 for a total of 96 biscotti at a price rivaling the warehouse club.

review/text: I had these Biscotti on vacation and really enjoyed them.  So when I saw them on Amazon, I jumped at the chance to buy them again at a good price.  While the Biscotti were very tasty, they were somewhat stale and not as crunchy as I remember from vacation.  Also, I noticed the expiration date was two months away from when I purchased them.  I don't know what the expiration dates are on those in the local grocery store but I wondered if these were excess Biscotti and that is why they were inexpensive.

review/text: great product; unfortunately shipping took a toll on the biscotti's (majority arrived in crumbs & broken pieces). Have since ordered an additional 8 boxes. The lemon ones were shipped in a second Amazon box which seemed to provide some additional protective, as only a few were broken in some of the boxes. Would recommend seller in the future ship all 12 pack boxes in a second box and add extra cushioning protection. It would allow folks to dunk their biscotti's rather than have to eat direct from the wrapper and get crumbs everywhere.

review/text: I looked all over for the Limone Biscotti after receiving a few at Christmas.  Unfortunately you can only get them in a combination package or in limited quantities.  So this opportunity to purchase a case was perfect.  My entire office enjoys having these biscotti with their morning tea or coffee.  You can't beat Nonni's.

review/summary: too expensive
review/text: There is nothing wrong with the product itself and that is the 5 star rating.<br />The prouct is very good.<br />My complaint is with the price!!!<br />I paid $35.99 for 6 boxes which comes to $5.99 a box.<br />I found the same thing at Wal-mart for $2.99 a box.<br />I could have bought 2 boxes at Wal-Mart for what I paid one box for through Amazon.<br />Not Good!!!<br />Jeanette

review/summary: Really Good - Highly Recommended
review/text: These Nonni's Biscotti "Originali" are truly great tasting and, surprisingly, only have 90 calories each! My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite when we sit down for coffee or tea.<br /><br />The almond flavor is perfect and the individual wrapped "cookies" keeps them fresh even after the box is opened.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/text: This biscotti is graced with a thin layer of limon (lemon) frosting sweetness.  Not the tough biscotti that has to soak for 10 min. before it can be eaten, these are easy to eat like a cookie, or quickly absorb your hot beverage.  My Japanese exchange student loved these, and when she returned with some to her home in Nagano, her mother wanted more!  So I purchased a case of my own and have sent her a couple of 8-count boxes as a present.  I have been unable to find them in the local grocery stores like I used to.  Other flavors are still available in stores, but not my beloved limon!  But they can be ordered!

review/summary: Nonni's is my favorite
review/text: I am a real biscotti fan.  I have ordered several Nonnie's flavors.  While I still give the plain my hightest mark, this turtle flavor was very good too.  The chocolate on the biscotti is very good.  Definitely four stars!

review/text: My husband and I love these!  We have them every day with our coffee and so much more economical to buy a case at a time from Amazon rather than individually at the grocery store.  Not only are they "delish" but at 100 calories per cookie, it's a guilty pleasure!
