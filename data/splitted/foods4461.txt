review/text: This product was a huge let down. I wanted something I could throw in my purse to have available on busy days. I am a huge miso soup fan, but not overly picky. If it is miso I'm usually happy with it. The first thing I noticed were the onions, they were brown and pathetic looking, like they had been used after they were rotten. The smell of this soup is like nothing I have experienced before it is so off putting I didn't want to try it at first, but I was famished, and only had a 15 minute break in between meetings. I couldn't even swallow it. I would happily starve if it meant I never had to go near this awful stuff again.

review/summary: product of china
review/text: Product of China.  Unhappy that the other reviewers did not mention this as it is clearly labeled on the back of the individual packs and the cardboard box that the packs are sealed in.  If "Product of China" was included in the item description or shown in the picture of the item, I would not have purchased.  I can't comment on taste since item went into a basket instead of my mouth.  But to try to be fair,  the labeling is all in English and states  "produced on HACCP certified site" and "best before date 03.15.2013."  Unable to return this item per "returns are easy."

review/summary: All the flavor is in the tofu and onion
review/text: I really like miso soup but this stuff just isn't very good. I don't know if it is the lack of a dashi stock due to it being vegetarian but the soup itself is very bland. All of the flavor seems to come from the overpowering onion and, surprisingly, the tofu cubes. The tofu cubes are extremely salty and it is odd to eat such a bland soup and then *POW* get hit in the face with salty tofu. I would expect the stock to be salty and the tofu to be bland. Did I mention the overpowering onion?

review/summary: Rockin' Miso!
review/text: You may be dismayed at what you find in the package BUT I'm here to tell ya that this stuff is really good!  I moved out to a remote location, where I have to drive an hour (or more) to get Japanese food so this suffices my craving for Miso at a decent price!  When you open it, it's nothing more than a small, dry block in a tray...BUT after you add hot water, you're pleasantly surprised!  Pretty impressive if ya ask me!  Even better, my 12-year-old picky eater LOVES it too!

review/summary: Very good Miso flavor and appetizing looking!
review/text: I love Miso and have tried a few other brands, but they always tasted different than what I've had at Japanese restaurants. This one tastes like the Miso I get at my favorite Japanese restaurant and it's a lot cheaper. So easy to make, just add water! Also, it's fun to watch the block of Miso soup come apart in the bowl after you add the hot water. It is the best looking instant Miso soup that I have had. I also follow a low carb and low sodium diet and this one fits my dietary needs.

review/summary: The worst tasting miso soup I have ever had
review/text: Let me start out by saying that I love miso soup, I could and sometimes do eat it every day. And I am not a miso soup snob, either, I  enjoy various brands/ recipes. I, however, found this particular brand to be a dud - lacking any flavor whatsoever and packed with way too much onion. It may have fine quality ingredients, which is the reason I bought it in the first place, but it does not deliver in the taste department.<br />Disclaimer: I do understand tastes differ.

review/summary: Excellent Nutrition. Did I Mention Great Taste?
review/text: About a week ago I was shopping in the fancy cookies and crackers section of our local grocery store and I found these 4.25-ounce boxes of Ak-Mak Sesame Crackers. Well, it was like finding an old friend. I've been using these things for years and years but I lost track of them upon changing stores several times. They are delicious. They're real crisp and crunchy and have an excellent sesame seed taste, along with whole wheat. They're low in fat and with no cholesterol. They contain no sugar and have a very low sodium content for a cracker. Plus they have some protein and a goodly amount of fiber. What more could you ask for in a cracker? I've often used them as a bread substitute, and they're much more nutritious than most breads. Did I mention they have a great taste?<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: The Product itself is Excellent; however I will only be able to use a portion of the shipment which I received.<br /><br />The Packaging and condition some of it arrived at my restaurant in was POOR***LESS THAN FAVORABLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1<br /><br />The second package was damaged and infested with ants. I had to get rid of three tubs out of an order of twelve because the plastic cartons had broken open, pearceing the plastic bag outer wrapping which attracted the ants.<br /><br />If more care and "smarts" had been used in the initial packaging process; the entire order could have been packed more tightly in the larger box which contained the greater part of the order; thus eliminating the breakage.<br /><br />I do believe that a CREDIT is due me for the three lost Containers.<br /><br />Respectfully Submitted,<br /><br />Chef Sam Pellegrino, Owner<br /><br />Pellegrino's Italian Kitchen & Catering

Would have been nice to know since we ordered a case and won't be using it all in two weeks. The product in the can is also all mashed up so if you want to use anchovies in the fillet(whole) this is not a possibilty. The expiration date should be listed on line.

review/summary: The elusive dairy-free chai mix!
review/text: I can't have dairy or soy, so I'd been looking for a dairy-free chai mix for a long time. Big Train already was my favorite chai brand when I could have dairy, so I was thrilled to find this dairy-free version. It is delicious, and has the same sweet and spicy taste of their other mixes. I used rice milk to prepare it and it came out tasting rich and satisfying. I'm sure it'd be good with coconut milk or almond milk too. Much richer and easier to make than if you try to brew your own chai from scratch. THANK YOU, Big Train--finally I can have chai again!

review/summary: The Best Thing I Have Ever Put In My Mouth
review/text: I don't even know where to begin... this is honestly the best soup I have ever had... and out of a bag!!  The flavor is amazing... its spicy but sweet, tangy but creamy all at the same time. I am a texture freak and the texture of this soup is unbelievable... its everything you would expect from soup but so much more with added crunchy and mushy veggies. I was skeptical of the bag that this soup is packaged in... but it actually cooks better than heating your soup in a bowl (it is actually entire hot... no cold or warm patches)... Campbells also added flaps on each side of the bag (where it is natural to grab while getting it out of the microwave) that make it so you don't burn your fingers. Let's just say I am in love... everyone should give these soups a try... I will be going back to the store to purchase more flavors to try!!!

This stuff is really good.  (I hope it doesn't turn out to be "The Stuff".)<br /><br />NOTE: This item, like all prepared soups, is high in sodium--not recommended for the sodium-restricted.

Next time I will pour the soup into a bowl before heating. I will be adding this to my rotation of choices for lunch.

review/summary: Coconut Curry Chicken Unexpectedly Amazing!
review/text: I saw these pouched soups while I was shopping at Wal-Mart and was surprised to see that they were not only Campbell's brand soups but how  out of left field the flavor choices were for Campbell's. While different, that didn't immediately make me confident that the flavors would actually be successful.<br /><br />I decided to buy only one pouch of the Coconut Curry Chicken to try it out. I like curry so if this worked out yay me! Well Yay Me! This was RIDICULOUSLY good. While it was heating in the microwave (as it said to do in the directions) the fragrant aromas started seeping out. I was shocked. This smelled almost exactly like when I make coconut curry sauce on my own. It smelled so fresh and authentic, the only thing left to doubt was the taste. Surely the aroma was just some canned, chemically manufactured olfactory trick. I was happily proven wrong. The taste and the smell all fit together. And unlike Campbell's canned soups, where you had small pieces of of mushy vegetables or meat, here you had big pieces of carrots and chicken and crunchy water chestnuts, the shittake mushrooms were small however, but not negligible.<br /><br />Seriously try it out for yourself. You won't be disappointed. As for me I'm going to go buy a heck of a lot more.

I'm also buying organic whenever I can, so now I've started experimenting with other tomato recipes using these and am loving them. My friends and family laugh at me when I do "subscribe and save" and buy a case at a time, but it's a great bargain and there's always a can (or more) on the basement shelf.

review/text: Muir Glen cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol A. Too bad because this was a great product and was a standard in my household. My initial conversations with them they contradicted this fact, which to me was misleading. General Mills owns Cascadian Farms as well and now I don't buy there either.<br />Now we use BioNature in jars or Pomi products in Tetra Pak cartons. All canned tomato products use BPA and so do many of the lids of jars used in food containment.<br />Now I also just make from scratch which is made simple by chef Andrew Carmellini in Everyday Italian. Lydia Bastianich is another favorite chef that deserves mention for simple yet big flavors.<br />Boil, peel, freeze and store. Can manufacturing companies that I corresponded with said they were working on a solution for later this year or next year.

review/summary: Very good Teriyaki Sauce
review/text: I made a stir fry with it the day after receiving it in the mail and it was really rather good.  In fact usually when I made it with other sauces there was leftovers but this time everyone had seconds and even some thirds and finished it.<br /><br />The only reason this didn't get 5 stars was that you really can't taste any pineapple in it. I figured the pineapple would be subtle when I bought it but we couldn't notice it at all.  But even with this minor flaw it is good sauce.<br /><br />EDIT: I used this to marinade a roast and it came out really good.  First I took a knife and poked allot of holes in the top of the roast, put garlic cloves in the holes then rubbed the roast down with a cup of this sauce and let it sit in the fridge over night.  After cooking in the crockpot for 10 hours on low it was out of site.  Even my very picky eater of a mom came over and loved it.  In fact she came back over today for leftovers.

review/text: I received this item the other day and every single can in the box was dented.  Not sure if this was a fluke thing or if it's normal since this was the first time ordering these.<br /><br />Also, my 20 month old daughter who eats everything under sun would NOT eat these.  I'm not sure if she didn't like the taste or if she just has to get use to them.  She LOVED her Gerber raviolis and since she ate so many of them I wanted to try and go organic but she can't seem to swallow these (no pun in tended).  I'm going to try a couple more times and if she won't eat them I will probably go back to Gerber brand.  Maybe my 5 month old son will like them when he's old enough.

review/summary: Smells WONDERFUL
review/text: I had seen this cat litter at a kiosk at the Pet Expo in Del Mar, CA and had noticed how wonderful it smells. The litter is composed of smooth, compressed and extruded pine sawdust pellets, shaped like miniature broken dowel rods. The sawdust is a by-product of the lumber industry, which must be convenient for the Florida company that produces Feline Pine, because pine trees grow like weeds in the South.<br /><br />I tried a bag to replace the ordinary silica clay cat litter we had been using for our little cat. It is not quite as absorbent or as fast-drying as clay litter; however, there is far, far less tracking and the sharp odor of ammonia is much less than that with the clay litter. Any "dust" that the pine pellets might have is not at all noticeable, and my little cat adjusted to using it without a problem.<br /><br />As the pellets absorb moisture, they swell and disintegrate into fine, soft sawdust. I suspect my little cat prefers the smooth texture of the pellets and the softness of the sawdust to the old small, hard, sharp clay gravel that got stuck in her paws. The sawdust does not dry as quickly as clay litter, even with daily "stirring", but the woodsy, evergreen fragrance of pine makes scooping much less of a chore.<br /><br />The only drawback to this litter is that the pellets are a bigger than clay litter gravel, requiring a wide-slot scooping tool so you don't dump a clump of pellets into the toilet when you scoop solid waste. The bag is attractive and resealable plastic, but I think paper packaging with a clear window to see the product would entice cat owners to switch. The packaging also says "CHEMICAL FREE..." which is false; our planet is composed of chemicals. H2O (water) is a chemical. It should read "HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL FREE" or "BIOTOXIN FREE".<br /><br />Anyway, I'll be using the old clay litter only to clean up the oil stains in my carport. Now that I've tried a premium litter, I'll experiment with the wheat and corn types to find which one my little cat likes best.

review/summary: Happy cat, very happy owner.
review/text: I am convinced this stuff is some sort of miracle for cat owners. My cat used to use the compressed, recycled newsprint litter (like Carefresh or Yesterday's News) and I thought that was good, but then I read about Feline Pine and decided to give it a try. Well, there is simply NO SMELL AT ALL. I live in a small studio apartment which I thought was forever fated to smell like a litterbox, but with the discovery of Feline Pine, which absorbs all of the ammonia  odor, you don't even know I have a cat unless you see her. The tracking is noticably reduced and there is much less mess. I highly recommend you try this stuff - my cat made the switch with no problem at all, and it's been completely worth it for both of us (my apartment doesn't stink, and she doesn't inhale clay dust.)

review/summary: How my life was spared.
review/text: Ever since I was a baby kitten, rescued from a busy street and parking lot, my lady owner has been squawking about my litter smell.  The nice guy who rescued me, smelled the litter box but didn't want to complain...cause he just loves me.  We are cool, we're real buddies.  But oh, that lady in the house, she tried everything to get me to stop stinkin'.<br /><br />I begged the nice guy to clean it up so mean lady won't get rid of me!  Every day he cleaned my box, but it still didn't work.  And sometimes he didn't remember too good and ohhhh the smell was baddddd.  Even for me.  And each week they hauled in different kinds of litter for me...still no good!  She hated the smell and swore to the man that I would have to go. Ow... Meow!  I could just hear her nagging voice:  Clean up that damn litter box!  I got a little scared every now and then.<br /><br />Then one day she heard about Feline Pine.  The pellets were little strange for me to get used to, but I was willing to do anything to keep the mean lady happy.  Then, I couldn't believe my whiskers.  There was no smell for weeks.  The pellets started turning to sawdust.  And there was no smell, same litter for two weeks or more!  Meow, Meow.<br /><br />I am happy, my nice man is happy cause mean lady is happy and a sweetie now.  All because of Feline Pine.  Lex

review/text: While this product is marketed especially for cats,I am not sure that it is prepared any differently than the wood pellets available for horses or wood stoves which sell at a fraction of the cost. $3/40lbs.  That is quite a big difference.  I recommend you use your own judgment about safety but I have had no problems using the stove pellets.

review/summary: great alternative to chemical clay based litter
review/text: after suffering with the chemical smells of the clay based litters, i was excited about trying feline pine. initially our two cats seemed to continue primarily using the clay litter box (we have two litter boxes, converted one to fp and kept using clay based litter in the second). However, we had some usage in the first and once we converted the second to fp they seemed to be perfectly happy. Results have been great! there is more odor immediately after the cat goes #2 but there is literally no on-going odor and the cats don't smell like chemicals after using the litter box. Much better for us and them. In addition, there is far less tracking (we use the non-clumping fp). Once the cat urine has broken the pellets into sawdust you can see some tracking of the sawdust but that is an easy indicator it is time to do some cleaning! Definitely need to have the right equipment (sifting cat litter box and the right scooper). Very happy customer.

I switched my multiple cat household to pine pellets, and for the first time EVER, I don't smell cat urine.  However, I don't buy Feline Pine.  Go to your local feed store and buy the 44 pound equine bedding pellets for about $6-7 per bag.  HUGE savings and the same stuff!

review/summary: Simply the best.
review/text: 1) Smells great.<br />2) Doesn't track everywhere.<br />3) Easy to maintain litter box.<br /><br />Easiest way to use this litter:<br /><br />1) Purchase a sifting litter box like the feline pine box or the Breeze. DO NOT buy the Van Ness sifting box, the holes are too big.<br /><br />2)Scoop solids daily with a pellet-specific scoop like the one that comes with the Breeze.<br /><br />3) Sift urine soaked sawdust to the bottom compartment by either shaking the box side to side or scooping the pellets around until the all the sawdust falls through to the bottom. I go with the latter because I don't feel like lifting it.<br /><br />4) Enjoy the rest of your day not worrying about the litter box.<br /><br />Remember to empty out the compartment with the sawdust every few days. I have 1 cat, so you may have to do it more often if you have multiple cats. I also keep the Breeze urine pads as lining in the lower part in case any urine trickles down and to absorb the smell of the sawdust.

review/summary: big fan and tolerance is growing
review/text: I am a spice and heat addict.  I need heat and the only products that give me any detectable heat, are specialty sauces like Dave's insanity or ghost pepper sauce.  I had bought the Insanity in the past and was looking for it when I found a discounted price on the ghost pepper.  For the past 10 days I have been using it on everything.  I supplement bbq sauces with it, blend it with salsas, even mix it with yellow mustard on egg, sausage, and cheese bagels.  My tolerance is growing.  I went from a dab to about 1/2 tsp already.  This allows me to enjoy the smoky, sweet flavor (at first all you feel is the heat).  I don't think that this is as hot as Insanity but it's been awhile and the internet searches all say that the ghost pepper is much hotter.  Maybe I am just advancing along my heat journey, but this doesn't seem to burn my skin/lips/mucous membrane as much as insanity sauce did.  I will be stocking up on more bottles of this sauce.  I put it on a drop at a time and then spread it with a knife.  I have found that it works best with a medium like BBQ, salsa, mustard.  You should put those on first since they are the vehicle to allow this to be spread evenly.  Otherwise the bread, tortilla, etc just soaks up the drops and you have uneven distribution.

review/summary: Man, is this good!
review/text: I like heat in my food. Every so often, I try to ramp up. A year ago, I tried my first habanero pepper. Boy, did that set a standard! Forget jalapenos and so on. Then, as I read further about hot peppers, I came across references to ghost pepper. Habaneros are hot; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year. As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner, you get heat and they also support flavor.<br /><br />I just got this product a week ago. I immediately used it with a pasta dish served at my place of employment. Two drops with the pasta--stirred so that the pepper sauce was spread evenly throughout the dish.<br /><br />Oh, boy! A nice heat. After finishing my dish, there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth. The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish, but actually added an additional element. In addition, my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running. But a small price to pay!<br /><br />This is a fine addition to my kitchen. I underdid the portion earlier today with an omelet, but I got it right with diced potatoes and onions for dinner. I am still learning, but I think that I will be routinely ordering this in the future as my current bottle is emptied.

review/summary: For those that love heat and flavor
review/text: I must begin by saying that we eat hot sauce with everything in our house. Habanero and above is a requirement to eat at our table. So with that in mind, pay no attention to those who say that they are using this as rodent repellent and other rediculous applications. This hot sauce is hot but not unbearable. It is flavorful and goes well in many of our dishes. I put some on our holiday turkey and was impressed by the way it interacts. Now, for those that think you have to splash hot sauce on everything, you really are just wasting product. A spread over a wide surface with just enough sauce to colorize the surface is perfect. We are comparing this sauce to the Dave's Insanity sauce which is slightly less heat at the beginning but Insanity burns longer with more intensity than this one does. This one trails off after a few minutes but doesnt have the intensity at the beginning. Overall, we definitly like them both and I am going to go ahead and purchase Ultimate Insanity today to fill out the offerings at our table. Great product!

If you do put it directly on your tongue it burns it until it is numb<br /><br />The flavor is quite mediocre. Different than any hot sauce I've tasted personally, but not necessarily in a good way.<br /><br />However, you'll note on the bottle that it is a good industrial cleaner and grease remove. And this is true.<br /><br />I use it on all of my pots and pans when after I cook in them, and I use it to clean my bathroom. I also used it on my baby, but now I don't have a baby anymore.<br /><br />For the dynamic aspect of it, it gets 5 stars.

However, it arrived a few days after Christmas at my family's house, and they had to forward to my place.

review/summary: Great Taste , So so heat..
review/text: Ghost peppers have a great flavor , I think this sauced captured that without blowing it away with heat. Don't get me wrong , it has decent heat but its not even close to the pain level of the Insanity sauce. This is a nice step up from something like Tapitio; its great on chicken , burritos , chili , etc. If you want to add some great ghost pepper flavor and a bit of heat to your food this is the stuff you want.

review/text: Jolokia peppers are rated as the hotest peppers in the world.  This is a newer entry in the extreme hot sauce category and must be used with care.  I once gave a bottle of a slightly less hot Dave's Insanity Sauce to a friend who claimed he liked things hot.  He used it like he would use his normal hot sauce and almost set himself on fire.  This particular sauce should be used a drop at a time in chili or similar foods until you determine your tolerance.  Keep a cold drink nearby, and be careful not to burn a hole through your chair.

review/summary: Critter Repellant
review/text: This sauce is far better suited as critter repellant than food.  Have a problem witth raccoons going through your trash cans? Put some of this on the lid and you'll never see them again.  If they touch it and then touch their mouth or eyes, they'll panic and remember it.  I eat habanero hot sauce every day- no exageration, no lie.  My wife and I love hot food and can handle it hotter than most.  This stuff, however, is just ridiculous.  It really should come with a big, bold warning rather than being nestled unassumingly among the other hot sauces.  The taste is good but you can't have enough of it on anything to enjoy it.  All of the other hot sauces in the fridge get empty and replaced while Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce sits untouched week after week.  In my opinion, this isn't a food; it's a repellant like mace.

review/text: My entire family loves hot foods and up until now it couldn't get too hot. Not so with this excellent product and I highly recommend that you do as the directions state; "One Drop at a Time" until you get the food the way that you like it.  Dump this sauce on the food like you do with other hot sauce and you are in for a shock!  If this sauce is too hot for you have some cold milk on standby, don't use water or soda to cool you down because it just makes the burn worse.  The burn will be worse the next morning on the toilet then it was eating the day before but there is nothing that you can do about that, maybe have a class of ice water to bour down your backside while you are on the toilet.  My family will be buying more of this product!

It has an initial tingle on your tongue/heat that starts to creep up but is gone within a min or 2.

review/summary: Maybe my taste buds are different.
review/text: I just tried this sauce moments ago. Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around. I love hot food, so I figured I might as well try it. I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno, habanero, cayenne, and other ordinary peppers. I'm no expert and would never claim to be, just to be clear. My initial impression of this sauce was "yuck" because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me. It is hot, yes, but not OMG-I'm-dying hot. Just... hot, and with a flavor-if you can call it that-I would not want on my food. Also, the heat lasted only about five minutes or so, without me even drinking anything.

review/text: Just bought few hot sauces for a personal review. This one was the obvious choice, being the most selling here on Amazon. Reviews was also favorable. I am quite surprised no one mentioned it stinks, and I mean bad. Makes your stomach turn (few people besides me feel the same way)!<br />Sure, it's hot but there are far more better alternatives out there, for one, 100% natural Blair's hot sauces (Mega death being the hottest from their standard line). This was actually the second one from package and I love it. Third one was "West African VooDoo Juice" that actually comes with handmade voodoo doll :), but besides that makes a great and original addition to your food and therefore deserves recommendation. Keep in mind that all of these are extremely hot and you will probably never eat them directly so bad smell (in case of Dave's Ghost Papper) will not be so intense. Still, I'm gonna give mine away and hope my friend will like it better.

review/summary: sauce not for mortals
review/text: I purchased a burrito from a small shop a few blocks from home. I was unimpressed with their habanero "hot" salsa. Eager to kick it up a notch, I reached for a bottle of what I later found to be Dave's Gourmet Ghost Pepper Jolokia Hot Sauce. I unscrewed the top and went to put a dab on. I quickly realized that there was no flow regulation but not before a large pool of the magma colored liquid dripped into my lunch. I decided to dab my finger in it and see what I was dealing with. It was formidable, sweet and flavorful with a long heat. I thought I could take the heat.<br /><br />I demolished the burrito, hot sauce and all, and shrugged off the pain. Every bite was saturated with the taste of a thousand tortured souls but the guacamole still tasted great. I wiped my tingling lips and while downing a glass of water I looked at the bottle. It claimed a heat rating of "Insanity++." I headed home thinking surely the worst must be over. I've ate plenty of hot food and my stomach is battle tested. I was wrong.<br /><br />I walked no more than a block before I started to feel odd. It was in the forties in Cleveland but I could feel the sweat forming on my brow. I walked another block and I could literally feel the burning sensation outlining my stomach. My breaths were noticeably faster and shorter. People on the street looked at me weird. I figured it would go away by the time I got home but I decided to pick up the pace. By the time my apartment was in sight I was experiencing tunnel vision and it felt like a live agitated weasel had been placed inside me. I knew what I had to do. After flushing my lunch, a tablespoon of this sauce, half a gallon of milk, and my ego down the drain, I can honestly say I am just happy to be alive. This sauce is not for mortals.

review/text: A few hours ago, I put a dime sized dab of this sauce on a corn chip and scarfed it down.  Initially, it was hot but certainly no hotter than other sauces I've had.  I quickly followed up with another dime sized dab on a chip.  Shortly thereafter, it began to feel as if my tongue was being electrocuted.  My eyes began to sting and my lips went numb.  The ecstasy brought about by eating spicy food poured up out of my mouth and into my head.  I laid down and the dog started to act very worried.  While prostrate, I focused on the pain and stared into the darkness of my own eyelids.  Every little thing becomes significant when the mind is seeking relief from pain.  I do not know what will happen when this stuff makes its way through my digestive tract.  I'll be eating more soon.

review/summary: The Hottest of the Hot (for now)
review/text: It seems like there is a new "Hottest Pepper in the World" every couple of years or so.  Not too long ago it was the Red Savina� Habanero with a Scoville heat rating of 577,000 units.  Now it is the Naga Jolokia (also known as the Naga Morris, Nai Miris, Bih Jolokia and Bhut Jolokia, etc.) with a whopping 1,001,304  Scoville Heat Units according to the New Mexico State University Chile Pepper Institute. In February 2007, Guinness World Records certified the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia) as the hottest pepper in the world.  It is reportedly called the "Ghost Pepper" because after one bite of the pepper you "give up the ghost".<br /><br />Now Dave's Gourmet has made a sauce from this serious pepper.  This is nothing to fool around with, it will cause pain, a lot of pain.  So why would anybody want a sauce that hot (other than for bravado)?  I for one like the taste.  It is a little smokier that Habanero.  I also use it in sauces where I want heat but not the red color of chili peppers, such as a cream based sauce.  Since it only takes a drop to give me the heat that I want it will hardly change the color of a white sauce.<br /><br />My only reservations about it is that it contains hot pepper extract (which is what they call the stuff that they spray in the eyes of criminals).  I've seen hot pepper extract for sale as a commercial additive.  It's low on flavor but big on heat.  Was this added to give the sauce extra pain inducing heat while using fewer actual Jolokia peppers? I don't know but it makes you think.  Dave also has a special edition sauce that uses the Bhut Jolokia pepper and cost about four times more than this one does.  I like this sauce, but use with caution.

review/summary: Playing With Fire
review/text: I've been experimenting with ways to give my guacamole an extra kick.  After receiving this industrial solvent in the mail, I called some buddies over for burritos, beer and baseball.<br /><br />Cut to fifteen minutes later: four men are sitting around, watching baseball and drinking beer as it dawns on them that there is an angry dragon writhing about in each of their stomachs.  The dragons breathe white hot fire that scorches their mouths and ravages their tongues.  Ever men, they remain erect and try to soothe the dragon's temper with gifts of alcohol. Quickly, though, the supply dwindles and furtive glances dart around the room.  Who will break first?  As sweat drips down their foreheads and stings their eyes, they try to think about baseball...think about baseball...think about baseball...and then one makes a break for it!  In an instant there is a stampede for the kitchen.  They fling open the refrigerator and, snorting like wild bulls, rip open another case and chug like Dionysus reborn--but to no avail.<br /><br />This alcohol is fueling the fire and not dousing it.  With choked and gasping breath one whispers "milk".  Upending the kitchen they can find none of the sweet elixir.  With tears streaming down their faces they tear outside, but in the rush of flailing limbs they fall into a heap on the pavement.  "Oh no" they say, realizing the horrible truth.  In their haste to quench this insatiable heat they made a fatal mistake: they are way too drunk to drive.  Rising from the ground, they take off on foot for the nearest corner store.  Soon, none can bear to breathe through their mouths; the dragon's flames lick at their lips unbearably.  As they breathe heavily through their noses, their sinuses are soon aflame from the intense heat and begin their own form of self defense.<br /><br />What a spectacle!  Four grown men with red faces, streaming eyes and snot flying into the wind as they gasp and wheeze down the road, driven by the fires of hell itself.<br /><br />Soon, the fat one falls, hitting the ground hard but stretching his hands out for help.  Through the sneezing and wheezing no words can escape his ruined lips.  Onward the three friends push with nary a backward glance.  "We will remember you fondly, fat one" they say to themselves, hearts roasted free of compassion.<br /><br />They burst into the corner store as one drunken, moaning entity of pure thirst and claw their way to the milk.  With wild abandon, they forego such modern niceties as payment and immediately pour gallons of soothing white mana into their gaping, flaming maws.  They sink to the floor in the silent thanks of men spared the gallows.  One thought lingers in their minds: "that guac sure was tasty."

review/summary: Handle with care, may commune with the dead if too much is consumed at once
review/text: Yep, it's insane alright.<br /><br />Having tried Dave's Original Insanity and hearing all the campfire stories of the dreaded ghost pepper I decided to embark on a mystical journey and ordered a bottle of this.<br /><br />The bottle was unassuming enough when it arrived. Standard shape, somewhat mundane label, but it contained a substance that had a curiously bright crimson and orange color. Once opened it had a spicy smell, not unlike Tobasco although thankfully without the overwhelmingly foul essence of vinegar.<br /><br />Well, time for a taste. I got a good thick coat of the bright substance on my index finger and took the plunge. It had a pretty nice tangy flavor... That is it had a nice flavor for about 1500 milliseconds before Oppenheimer hit the red button and, "I am become heat, the destroyer of digestive tracts."<br /><br />The heat hit me like a runaway freight train hitting a house of cards. No, make that a run away freight train with several JATOs attached to the rear propelling it somewhere above the upper class neighborhood of mach 2. I doubled over and let out a raspy gasp, my face flushed to a hue not unlike the sauce itself, my eyes became a water park. My aural senses became dull like I was at the bottom of a swimming pool.<br /><br />I heard a knock at the door and stumbled towards it with blurred vision. It was a county sheriff at the door and he was there to serve me. My own tongue, esophagus, uvula, stomach, and intestinal tract had somehow just filed a class action lawsuit against me. I reeled backwards and fell onto the couch and tried to focus my bleary eyes on a small fuzzy object on the floor. It was my cat, standing quietly and observing my plight. Maybe it was the impaired vision, maybe it was the start of something more spiritual, but my cat's face warped into a Cheshire smile many times the girth of his face. Each tooth glowing with the luster of tarnished gold in an unholy candlelight. His eyes sank back into ashen voids, glimmering ember pin points at the center of each gaping socket. The room around him began to dance and spin and the walls eventually melted away to reveal a brimstone canyon stretching as far as could be imagined. "Soooo hoooot it's spoooooky," my cat boomed, his voice echoed with a baritone bass that would surely send James Earl Jones running for the hills. Sweating, hyperventilating, and nearly blind, my vision finally faded to black.<br /><br />I awoke with blinding light bombarding my face. How long was I out? Slowly gyrating figures came into focus and as my eyes adjusted more I recognized them as people standing over me. A few more moments and I was able to see one of the faces and... Grandpa?!<br /><br />I bolted upright nearly headbutting the entire crowd looming over me "Am I dead?!" I shouted.<br /><br />"No, no. You just had a bit too much of the insanity sauce in one go, I'm afraid. You'll be back to the mortal world in a few moments," my grandpa stated non nonchalantly, adjusting his tie slightly.<br /><br />"So, wait," I began, "Wha... what is this? ...Is this?"<br /><br />"Maybe," grandpa shrugged, "Perhaps you can ask me again on your next visit in a day or two."<br /><br />"Next visit?!" I shouted, "I'm not touching that sauce ever again! Except maybe per drop. Diluted in very large amounts of some sort of substrate like chilli. I-"<br /><br />Grandpa smiled and interrupted, "You only have a few seconds left. You'll be back at least once more, I know that for sure."<br /><br />"For sure?" I asked genuinely confused.<br /><br />Grandpa tiled his head, looking at me like I had just grown a third eye, "Well yeah. You already ate the stuff, and what goes in has to come out eventually."<br /><br />My face cracked and was painted with the same look a deer must have in the headlights of an approaching freight train that is powered by several JATO motors. Before I could seek further council I was grasped firmly by an unknown force and suddenly yanked away. The light got sucked into darkness and the roar of passing wind deafened me. I was falling.<br /><br />Soon something came into focus, approaching fast. It was the ground, rushing to greet me with the eagerness of a freshman salesperson thinking they've identified an easy mark. I began screaming, as if that would help. My life didn't flash before my eyes, I didn't have any final profound thoughts, my whole head was filled with paralyzing unmitigated terror. Closer, closer, closer. The ground hurled itself towards me in excitement to say hello to my face with a big wet, red kiss. And just as I'm 1mm away from contact...<br /><br />I jerk upright on my couch, back in my house. Sweaty and tongue numb, cat still sitting on the floor looking as plain as can be. I breathe a heavy sigh of relief, although doing so has a noticeable heat to it due to the remnants of the sauce. I hold my head in my hands and try to regain composure, reassuring myself it was just some weird dream brought on by everyday stress combined with the sudden shock of the ghost pepper sauce. My eyes drift around coming to rest on a stack of papers on the coffee table. Legal papers? I'm... I'm suing myself?<br /><br />I've since been eating lots of cheese and chocolate hoping to stave off the inevitable second visit to Grandpa.<br /><br />This sauce is hot. Really hot. Use a drop at a time in large volumes of other stuff that needs a bit of heat.<br /><br />Pros: Ultra super mega hot. Nice bright, festive color - If HGTV did a makeover of Satan's house they'd probably paint the living room with this stuff for the color.<br />Cons: Flavor is made irrelevant due to the absurd level of heat. No stopper in the bottle's neck so be careful about pouring.

review/summary: Holy Heck!!
review/text: I saw this innocent looking bottle on the shelf of a specialty market and it winked at me. I am a lover of hot sauces and have heard about the nuclear qualities of the Ghost Pepper. I had heard that it needed 2 keys turned at the same time just to open the bottle.. The label claims it is a "great industrial cleaner and grease remover".. Bah, enough I said. I had made some Turkey chili previously and had some leftovers so what a great way to try this "So hot it's spooky" sauce. I put a tiny bit on my pinky and licked it off, immediately my lips,toungue and mouth were tingling. It tickled my fancy. After a few minutes I began to sweat and my face flushed a bit. Bah... No worries. My wife sampled a drop on the end of a toothpick and was burning up for almost an hour. I splashed a drop into my chili, stirred it and nothing. Felt no heat, dropped some more in.. stirred it and let it set, mmmm good heat... I went do put some more sauce in and a quarter sized glob ejaculated out. I stirred it, let it set and Holy Hell... What a difference. I instantly began sweating, my nose was dripping and my sinus cavity was conflagrated. I loved it. I ate more, it got worse. My hearing diminshed and my eyes were burning. I ate more chili, my esophagus burned. I kept on going, had some milk. I finished the bowl in about 20 mins. I felt like death. It hit my stomach and it felt like a WWF battle royal in there. I got dizzy, had to sit down.. I became soft spoken and started to burp a lot. The next 2 hours created so much bubbly gas that I farted about every 30 seconds, some so loud that it registered on the Richter scale. I felt better. I survived. I had to work the next day. I am a firefigher and am used to heat. I had to poop. I never felt more of a delightfully different burn coming out of me. I had 3 of these episodes in about an hour. Putting a roll of toilet paper in the freezer would have helped quell the fire. I laughed, the guys on my shift laughed.<br /><br /> All in all, it's really a great tasting sauce with a lot of heat. Will I do this to myself again.. You bet your ass I will :)

review/summary: Dayum.
review/text: This sauce is HOT. It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food, more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili (or for pranking your friends). Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot, it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency. I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight-up jolokia. Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable, but the heat sneaks up on you about 2-3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity. Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there. Yeah, its hot!<br /><br />Please know what you are getting into if you buy this. It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot. The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick. This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something. Be warned!

review/summary: Flavor playing second-fiddle to heat?
review/text: While the Scoville rating on the Bhut Jolokia (aka Naga Jolokia, Ghost Pepper) is no doubt impressive, what does it taste like? Does Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce capture the taste of the pepper?<br /><br />I, for one, absolutely love the fruity, bright taste of the Habanero - yes, Habaneros are hot, but their taste is exquisite; capturing that taste, or complimenting it, in a hot sauce takes real skill. Now, to be honest, I'm not sure what the Bhut Jolokia tastes like in its raw state, as I have yet to have the opportunity to try it (though I am looking for just such an opportunity). I would assume this sauce does the job, considering the ingredient list:<br /><br /> * Naga Jolokia<br /> * hot pepper extract<br /> * salt<br /> * vegetable oil<br /> * roasted garlic pulp<br /> * acetic acid<br /><br />The thing that worried me is that second ingredient - "hot pepper extract" is, no doubt, capsaicin. I take issue with including it in this hot sauce, as it artificially raises the heat level. Why not allow the Bhut Jolokia stand on its own? Who cares if the resulting sauce doesn't melt my face off? "The Source" or the plethora of has-no-flavor-but-who-cares-because-its-insane-heat-impresses-people hot sauces can do that for me if I am looking for that kind of experience.<br /><br />Overall, this sauce has a decent flavor if you can get past the distracting quantity of heat. I suppose I should have expected the company that gave us "Dave's Insanity Sauce" to miss the mark, since heat seems to be their only goal; none of "Dave's Gourment" sauces has ever impressed me with flavor, I shouldn't fault them for merely being consistent. :)

review/summary: An slightly hotter and less intrusive version of the original
review/text: The Ghost Pepper version of "Dave's" has a great lingering heat from which rises an excellent flavor that enhances rather than hides the taste of your food.  Did I mention that it is a LINGERING heat?  This is a great sauce with a familiar, distinctive "Dave's" taste that leans a little more toward sweet (and away from bitter) than original "Dave's".  Personally I prefer this slight shift toward sweet with most foods on which I've tried the sauce.  This will not keep me from continuing to use the original on hotdogs, perogies, and chili, etc...

review/summary: Not as tasty as the original
review/text: I have been a fan of Dave's original insanity sauce for years. Heck, it's economical. All I need is one drop into whatever it is I am eating or cooking, and I am done. With other hot sauces, I would go through an entire bottle in a week. What made me a fan of Dave's hot sauces, is the smoky flavor that still comes through despite the heat.<br /><br />My last bottle of Dave's original insanity sauce was running out, and I thought I'd give a different one a try. I decided on the Ghost Pepper hot sauce because it has good review and free shipping from Amazon. I received the shipment very fast, it almost feel like next day although I certainly did not pay for that option. I tried the hot sauce in a stew I made by just putting a couple of drops in my bowl. It's got good heat like the original, but I find the flavor lacking a little. It's got a different flavor that reminds me of a Louisiana style hot sauce, but not quite as tangy. It's just as hot, though I don't feel it's much hotter, than the original.<br /><br />I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I will by buying another bottle of the original Dave's insanity hot sauce.

review/summary: Burns from the inside out
review/text: I like really hot food, but I don't eat it just to show off (well, maybe a little).  There's a pretentious part of me that likes being able to experience new tastes, tastes that the average person wouldn't even notice due to their excruciating tongue agony.  If I don't enjoy those flavors, then the whole exercise is pointless.<br /><br />If you can handle it, this sauce *tastes good*, which is a rare treat among the ultra-hot sauces.  I would apply it liberally to many different dishes, if I didn't value my sanity so highly.<br /><br />The experience differs from other sauces.  With other hot foods (even mild ones like jalape&ntilde;os), it's a pretty straightforward battle: it's spicy, I ate it, and now it's burning my mouth.  Then there's this sauce (and other ghost pepper-based foods), which is a whole different thing... instead of it burning me, it feels like *I'm* the one burning and I just didn't notice it until now.  It's a fun twist.<br /><br />Word to the wise: this stuff builds up over time.  When the bottle first arrived, I put a tiny dot of it on a french fry just to check it out.  I tolerated that small amount with no problem, but it'll sneak up on you.  It started with a mild tingle, and built to a noticeable sting over the course of about five minutes.  If you forget this fact, you'll eat an enchilada with a bit of sauce on every bite and finish the meal feeling like a champ... only to be rendered speechless and near-catatonic ten minutes later.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this sauce to anyone who *isn't* just in it for the bragging rights.  And for those who are: I've felt more burn than this, but not often and rarely from such small amounts of the "active ingredient".

review/summary: Dave's Ghost Sauce
review/text: This stuff is ultra-hot and was exactly what I was looking for to spice up my chili recipes. One teaspoon in a bowl of chili is sufficient to release a torrent of endorphins and cause the eater to sweat profusely. After accidentally adding too much Ghost Sauce to one bowl of chili, my wife made me take a shower before she'd get close to me. It was as if nearly every pore in my body opened up and went into overdrive producing sweat.<br /><br />Don't expect to get much flavor out of this sauce. It's all about heat. If you're looking for something that tastes great on its own, you'd best look elsewhere. But if it's heat your after, you've chosen the right product. I always add a good dose of Tabasco sauce for flavor, but Tabasco is pretty puny when it comes to setting my mouth on fire. Dave's Ghost Pepper Sauce gets the job done!

review/summary: Not as hot as was described in reviews but excellent sauce !
review/text: This sauce is hot but no where near as hot as Chodruff talks about in his review. That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two. This is one of my favorite sauces now. I bought a bottle a month ago and it is about 1/3 gone whereas Daves insanity lasted me years ( unless my tolerance is just growing ;-) ) Enjoy!!!

review/summary: Face melting goodness
review/text: This stuff is great. I've noticed some of these reviews saying it tastes/smells nasty - I suspect a bad batch - because what I just had is really quite tasty. Its also very, very hot. I had a quarter sized dollop on a corn chip (after a couple smaller doses) - and its a really quite excellent 15 minutes burn - tears, sweat, red face and a nice endorphined finish. That being said, I've had raw habaneros that seemed hotter, and lasted longer (it's all pretty subjective). There were no hiccups, or that panicky feeling you sometimes get when you've had something "way too hot". It ramps up nicely, and crests at about 10 minutes; gone in 15. I suspect this stuff is some portion of the heat of a raw jolokia pepper, but not really on par with the real thing (hard to say since I've not yet had one). So, yeah, really great burn without being over the top. And its quite a nice hot sauce too - smoky and a little sweet. There may be hotter sauces out there, but this is just a good hot sauce, that happens to be face-meltingly hot, as well. In all actuality, as hot as "edible" gets - any hotter and you really wouldn't want it on a taco. Fun at parties, and highly recommended.

review/text: Okay, I love flavors you can feel and Dave does an excellent job here packing heat without sacrificing flavor.  I've cooked with it and added it to pre-cooked foods.  I'm sort of irritated with the 'oh my god this is sooooo hot' reviews.  Really, you can find hotter sauces that use more pepper or an extract. And it will be an over-priced bottle of flavorless heat.<br /><br />If like hot sauce, and habanero is your starting point, you'll be very happy with this.

The review I got from the person I gave it to as a gift said it caused him to break into an all-over sweat, he teared up, had to stand over the sink with his mouth open for 20 minutes, and was late for work that morning.  This is someone who eats things with hot sauce added regularly and has never had a hot sauce win.  This one did.  Mission accomplished.

review/summary: That's no sauce - it's a paste
review/text: I have a half-dozen varieties of ghost pepper sauces in my house, and this one rates at or near the bottom for several reasons.<br /><br />First, yes, it's hot. But it's hot for hot's sake: the sauce is really just a heat delivery system, without really bringing anything to the party in terms of flavor. It smells like it should have some of the smoky sweetness of a good jolokia sauce, but if you can actually pick up any distinctive flavors behind the wall of heat it generates in your mouth I'd be surprised.<br /><br />Second, the texture of this sauce is just off. I know Dave's sauces tend to be thicker than most, but this is practically a paste. The thickness causes two major problems. The sauce is difficult to dose out, tending to either catch in the bottle's neck or plop out in large dollops well beyond what any reasonable person would want. Also, it's hard to distribute across your food.<br /><br />Third, it's impractical. Something this hot and thick is far more useful as an ingredient than a condiment, but even when I'm making spicy food I seldom have need for anything this potent. I can't imagine using it on a slice of pizza or in scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Sauces like Holy Jolokia and Naga Soreass will let you experience the subtle flavors that come with the intense heat of the pepper. Dave's Ghost Pepper just gives the heat, without really showcasing the pepper itself.<br /><br />Get it for when you make large pots of chili or when you want to haze fraternity pledges. Otherwise, stick with thinner sauces that have some versatility.

review/summary: It's like a fiery punch in the mouth, but DELICIOUS!
review/text: Such an unsuspecting bottle, who would have thought! Never mind the warning on the label marked "Intense++" or the fact it says the sauce doubles as an industrial degreaser! Onto my story, a co-worker had brought some of this colon cleaner into the office. I noticed a group of co-workers huddled around sticking toothpicks into a mysterious red bottle. Come to find out it is Dave's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce. Being the connoisseur of spicy foods and sauces that I am, I couldn't help but chuckle inside at my co-workers. Using toothpicks to try hot sauce? Really? PANSIES! So I did the only logical thing, I had to show them up! I grabbed the bottle (before reading anything on the label), put a dime size drop on my hand, and promptly licked it off! The first few seconds were magical, Dave's sauce packs a wallop of flavors, however before I could even discern what flavors those were, my enjoyment quickly turned to "Holy crap, that was a bad idea". My tongue and lips were instantly on fire! Being use to many different spicy and fiery foods, I knew I would be ok, but since I was not expecting the tongue punching that I just received I was taken back. For the next 5 minutes or so my tongue was tingling and so was my poor lips, which by the way had an open wound from me biting down on it during dinner the night before. That's another story, but as you could imagine it did not help one bit! Anyways, this sauce is damn good and I immediately ordered some last night to add to my pantry. This is definitely a sauce that should be used in moderation and will be awesome mixed together with actual food or other condiments. Not recommended for solitary consumption.
