review/text: Iw as skeptical about a sugar free chai, having been a BIG fan of regular chai, David Rio did NOT disappoint!! I've made with both milk and water and a combination of both and anyway it's wonderful- creamy, sweet and a perfect mix of flavor- no caffiene, no sugar, literally a guilt free treat. I'm so happy to have discovered this!!

It tastes just as you imagine a creamy vanilla chai latte should... AND it has NO trans-fats, and NO aspartame (it's made with splenda)! I just pray that David Rio comes out with a sugar free version of the chocolate chai...

review/summary: Good to Drink Occasionally
review/text: I drink hot tea on most days and have found this one is tasty and sweetens other teas when mixed (I usually make 4 cups at a time & just use one bag of this in the whole batch). It really seems to help if I am feeling a little puffy or bloated. It has a very pleasant taste. The instructions for use are different from ordinary tea, so read those and follow them when first trying it or you might get mild diarrhea...it happened to me, nothing painful, just frequent trips to the restroom.

Each plant consisted of an inch long plug of soil with three or four leaves the largest being at least 3 inches long.  These were easy to plant and I look forward to watching them grow to full size.

review/summary: Great Tea
review/text: When I boughtmy Keurig there were two of these as a sample.  I really didn't think the coffee maker could do tea - after all, it is a coffee maker - so I waited a while to try it.  As a matter of fact, I offered one of the two to a co-worker (thinking I wouldn't like it) and, after smelling it, I made me a cup.<br /><br />I was hooked, and bought my own box after trying it.  If you like Earl Grey tea, or any hot tea, I would recomend this one.  Some people like it with a little lemon or other things added to it, but I like it "plain" as it comes out of the K-cup.<br /><br />I would recommend using the small or medium setting, as the large setting (to me) waters it down a little bit.  However, to each their own - give it a shot and use whatever setting works for you.

We figured the machine and K-cup paid for themselves already.  The energy it took to boil the water, cost more.

I was surprised to find that this blend does not taste like Earl Grey at all. While other brands vary as well, to me, this one strays so far as not to be recognizable as Earl Grey. Of course many may like it nevertheless.

review/summary: Pignoli
review/text: Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines, the family Pinaceae, genus Pinus). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of great value as a human food. The Woodstock Farms organic Pine Nuts are some of the best I have used and eaten. I always saute then in either olive oil or butter, then mix them in recipes or with rice and couscous. They give a delectable flavor, and add a great deal to any food.<br /><br />''Pine nuts have been eaten in Europe and Asia since the Paleolithic period. They are frequently added to meat, fish, salads and vegetable dishes or baked into bread. In Italian they are called pinoli (in the U.S. they are often called "pignoli" but in Italy "pignolo" is actually a word far more commonly used to describe a fussy, overly fastidious or extremely meticulous person)[10] and are an essential component of Italian pesto sauce. Pignoli cookies, an Italian American specialty confection (in Italy these would be called "biscotti ai pinoli"), are made of almond flour formed into a dough similar to that of a macaroon and then topped with pine nuts. In Spain, a sweet is made of small marzipan balls covered with pine nuts, painted with egg and lightly cooked. Pine nuts are also featured in the salade landaise of southwestern France. Pine nut coffee, known as pi&ntilde;&oacute;n (Spanish for pine nut), is a speciality found in the southwest United States, especially New Mexico, and is typically a dark roast coffee having a deep, nutty flavour; roasted and lightly salted pine nuts can often be found sold on the side of the road in cities across New Mexico to be used for this purpose, as well as a snack. The Nevada, or Great Basin, pine nut has a sweet fruity flavor and is relished for its large size, sweet flavor and ease of peeling." Wikipedia<br /><br />Pine nuts are a necessity in my kitchen, and the Woodstock brand is the best I have had.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-12-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN5O46">Woodstock Farms Thompson Raisins, Organic, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HLQ2O">Woodstock Farms Raw Almond Butter -- 16 oz Each</a>

review/summary: Tastes good, has a smooth texture, but a rubbery consistency
review/text: I'm using this with the Presto Flip Belgian waffle maker. This is my second mix after Carbon's Golden Malted Flour. The latter requires more prep time and is more bland, but turns out with a perfect fluffy consistency on the inside with a light crust on the outside. I like the blandness too since it gives a blank slate to work with when adding nuts, blueberries, bananas, etc. I wanted to try this Heartland Mix for mornings when we have less time to work with, and because I love chocolate (who doesn't?!).<br /><br />I really liked the smooth texture that the waffles turned out with. They looked more professional than the Carbon mix which had a slightly mottled surface. The taste was pretty good too. But the waffles themselves were very rubbery and you had to work harder to chew them. I did let the mix rest for 20 minutes so I doubt that's the issue. Maybe I got a bad mix? Maybe I needed to wait a little longer? I'm not sure. I will revise this rating if I find out I missed something. As it is, the consistency is not going to work for us.<br /><br />I found that I could salvage the mix by adding 1 part to every 3 parts of Carbon's.

Needless to say this mix has been a big hit with her and me. They cook up nice and quick in our waffle iron actually cooking a little faster than the straight vanilla flavor mixes, so keep an eye on them.<br /><br />The waffles themselves turn out with a nice crispy exterior with a dense soft middle. We have found these make awesome dessert waffles, simply add a little sweetened whipped cream and enjoy! The chocolate flavor is also a true malted flavor, I would almost compare it to the chocolate flavor of Ovaltine.

review/summary: nice flat bread crackers
review/text: These are fantastic, if you're looking for a flat bread style cracker that won't overpower whatever dips, compotes, and cheeses you're serving alongside them. I stumbled across these as I was searching for something comparable to the tuscan crackers from whole foods. These are flatter, but gave me the exact same flavor profile. I really like them, and they remind me of naan in a cracker or perhaps a flour tortilla cracker. A small package retails for $4.99 at my local grocery, so I was happy to find them here for much less. Perfect for large parties!<br /><br />They aren't covered in SALT and BUTTER, so if you're looking for a salty, buttery cracker - stick with Ritz or Club crackers.

review/text: My puppy can't seem to get enough of it. She was on Purina puppy chow and barely ate it plus my vet told me it was not healthy for a growing small breed puppy. I researched on line and bought this one. First of all, as soon as she hears the bistro dispensing the food she runs to the machine and devours the food. For her last meal I add warm water to as recommended on the package to release its natural smells and flavors.

So I switched to Science Diet Lamb and Rice Meal dry dog food...still just as picky. I have heard great things about Blue Buffalo and decided to give it a shot - she loves it! I've been mixing it half half with the Science Diet food, but she eats only the Blue Buffalo and then comes back an hour or so later to finish up the Science Diet. She has had no digestion issues and eats the LifeSource bits mixed in with the food as well - I had heard some dogs are picky and won't eat the LifeSource bits, but so far she likes them!

review/summary: It may not be the best choice for everyone
review/text: I was drawn in to this brand by all the advertising and great reviews. However it did not work well for my dog. This food gave my puppy the worst diarrhea. It is hard enough to potty train her as it is and then I had to deal with her not being able to control her #2. I do care about what goes into my pets because they are like family so I wish that this food did not cause the gastro  problems. So I started feeding her a brand that people dismiss as inferior (Science Diet). I have two other pets who have eaten Science Diet since I got them and they are 16 and 12 years old. So they must be doing something right.

review/text: Love these little cookies! They are crunchy with the almonds, chewy with the little raisins and are not too sweet. I enjoy them with coffee and tea. I discovered them at the local Wal-mart a few weeks ago. They sold out last week (maybe I bought them all!) and have not restocked so I went looking on the internet for them. Voila! Amazon has them plus a few more flavors from the same company!  I ordered these and the the Ginger. These are still my favorite.<br /><br />The packaging was good - maybe too good - the box was twice as big as the volume of the cookies and had those air-filled plastic "bubbles" filling up the void. I am pleased my cookies arrived in good shape but not sure all that packaging was needed.

We were delighted to find them recently on Amazon for a better price and ordered a bunch.  Well, they arrived in a smashed cardboard carton with no inside protection, many of the biscuits were crumbled and the ones that survived were stale.  Fortunately we were able to obtain a refund from Amazon but will certainly not order them again.  Bummer! Back to our local grocer!

review/summary: Every morning with coffee!
review/text: I found these great little cookies looking for anything low-salt in the cookies/cakes/pastry line.  I will admit that eating one is not exactly the same ecstatic experience as eating a really top-quality brownie.<br /><br />But that's a good thing, I've decided!  They are delicious but don't seem to bulldoze willpower in the way that a super sweet, buttery-rich treat does.  They are very crispy, similar to a hard biscotti but still easy and pleasant to munch on because they are thin and bite off easily.<br /><br />And not only are they low in salt, they are also quite low in calories.  I like a little something sweet with my coffee in the mornings.  A couple of these cookies gets it done for me for at a remarkable 67 calories!  I have never before felt satisfied with any accompaniment to my coffee at anywhere near that number of calories.<br /><br />Now let's not be crazy: This is not a substitute for an egg mcmuffin or any kind of traditional breakfast.  But for what is essentially a light, tea biscuit, it goes an awfully long way.  And I ~love~ them!<br /><br />Edit, 9/9/12: I just placed an order for 4 x 6 packs, i.e., eighty bucks worth of cookies, more or less.  It became just too much of a burden to repeatedly order them 2 x 6.  Someone complained about them being broken up.  That's a problem...they break.  I've bought them broken up at the grocery store, too.  Realistically, this is not much of a problem unless you are serving them at an elegant "tea."  I don't have a problem with a lot of them being in bite-sized bits.<br /><br />Amazon's price is a little higher than it once was.  Not sure what is happening with the price at the grocery store.  I mostly order them so that I don't have to hunt them in the grocery store...they are a bit of a category buster and can be hard to find even in stores that have them.  One day I went to Trader Joe's where I had been buying them; their shelf location was unchanged but they only had a couple of packs left.  I'm Amazon Prime and Brown brings them right to my door in two days.  What's not to like.

review/text: I usually look for cheaper products that can offer a filling meal, and this is one of the more perfect examples where lower price doesn't mean lower quality. I found the Maruchan Yakisoba Savory Soy to be quite delicious and filling; definitely one of my favorites. Was pleasantly surprised at how well the vegetables tasted as well; way better than the smaller, typical cups of ramen. It's a product both my wife & I plan on ordering time and time again. The only problem I had with the product is not enough soy flavor for my personal taste, but this was easily remedied with a single left over soy packet from the last time we ordered Chinese delivery.

review/summary: Can't beat the product or price!
review/text: When I ordered these, it was because they were a flavor of Maruchan Yakisoba I hadn't tried (they don't sell soy sauce flavor at the stores I go to) and subscribing was VERY cheap compared to buying the ones I get for $1 each at stores. I must say that Maruchan is the best brand of this type of meal of the 2 brands of similar prices in stores IMO (this and Nissin Chow Mein), and this flavor is great. To me it tastes more like a teriyaki than just soy sauce.. I think it has a very slight spiciness and sweetness.<br />In Maruchan Yakisoba there are always plenty of vegetables (unless you get the cheese flavored meals), and I especially like that this flavor has the wider flat noodles instead of the round ones. I tried one plain when they arrived and another one  I added cooked shrimp to. I think this would be good with added cooked beef, chicken, or pork too, but you're not missing out at all if you just make it the way it comes without adding any thing.<br /><br />These would also be good to have in case of an emergency because the noodles seem to be pre-cooked and only require re-hydration. you could make it by just pouring boiling water (or the hottest water available) in, covering well, and letting it sit for a little while,  stirring it a couple of times while you wait to get all of the noodles and vegetables into the hot water. Cold water might work but it would probably take a long time to re-hydrate every thing.<br /><br />Another thing you could do if you have plain ramen noodle soup packets around the house that aren't getting eaten and you don't have quite the right shaped bowls to cook them in the microwave is save the trays from these and use them. It says on the package not to reuse the tray, but I think that is for liability reasons. I have yet to melt one from reusing it. What I like to do is put the noodle block into the bowl, add meat and/or a bit of small frozen vegetables like corn and peas, fill water to just under the line and cook until the noodles are done, then add the seasoning packet. I find the full ramen soup packet is too salty for me some times though so if you do this, I would add some at a time until it suits your taste.

review/summary: Love These Little Candies
review/text: I have been purchasing Flavigny's Violet Pastilles for more than 30 years.  They are hard to find, so I'm glad I could find them online.  Whenever I come across them, I always get some for my brother and now for both my sons.  I take them to work with me and when I offer them to co-workers, they always ask me where I get them!  A nice conversation starter and friend maker.

review/summary: Delicious, but strange
review/text: These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.

review/summary: One of the best tomatillo salsas on the market.
review/text: First things first...if you are sensitive to spicy foods, go lightly as you adjust your pallet to the heat this salsa provides.  Everyone has their own heat tolerance level and I would say that this salsa does warm up your mouth, could possibly cause your nose to run but has a vinegary jalapeno taste that is unmatched by any other commercial tomatillo hot sauce that can be sourced locally at your neighborhood grocery store and/or Wal-Mart.  While I try to share my business amongst various grocery stores and markets in the town I live in, I believe my Wal-Mart sells this for less than $3 for a 1kg/35oz bottle.  I love to put this on frozen burritos and it is awesome with tortilla chips.  I was actually introduced to this salsa by a Cuban-American family that we are friends with and they always have it on standby for the congris (black beans and rice) that the mom of the family makes.  And really, unless you have a garden with tomatillos, jalapenos etc. at your disposal, can you really make it for less than your local store might sell it for? Anyway, I rate it highly even though my gabacho palate is still adjusting to the uncountable number of salsas that are out there.

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/summary: Delicious in Soups and Salads
review/text: These croutons transcend the simple name for stale bread added to your soups and salads as filler. These tiny little croutons are so delicious, packed with garlicky, seasoned yumminess that has everyone who tries them shouting (with a mouth full), "Oh My God! What are these things?! They are delicious!" I ordered these accidentally a year ago while looking for a different kind of crouton, and it was one of the most fortuitous accidents in a while. My husband and I eat a lot of soup, and like adding croutons to our soups for crunch. When these are added to any food, they simply enhance the flavor, making your meal a total delight! When I opened the box of 12 packages and realized I had ordered the wrong thing, I passed some packages around to my sister, mother, and mother-in-law, because I had so many and it wasn't really what I was trying to order. As soon as I tried them, though, I was mad at myself for passing them around because they were delicious! Now everyone wants them and stalks my pantry for the box I keep hidden. These things are amazing!<br /><br />They have a strong garlic flavor, but aren't too salty. They are very small and clump together a little because of the olive oil used to treat the croutons. Give these a shot and you won't be sorry. And don't let your family try them because you will have to hide them when they come to visit. I know I do!

review/summary: no lemon. not much green tea
review/text: If you're looking for a combination of the three flavors mentioned in the title of this tea, it's probably not a good idea for you to purchase this (especially 6 boxes of it). The tea's flavor is dominated by ginger, and some lemongrass, with barely any green tea taste. That's right, not lemon, but lemongrass. Not exactly what one might expect from a product titled "lemon ginger green tea." It doesn't necessarily have a bad taste, just an unexpected one. If I want my tea to have more of a green tea flavor, i prepare this with another plain green tea bag.

review/summary: Great Green Tea and Great Company!
review/text: This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several "natural" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using "natural" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.

review/summary: Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!
review/text: I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional "Gyokuro" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.

review/summary: Interesting blend
review/text: My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct "earl grey" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.

It doesn't have that added 'bite' of black pepper that some chai teas have. It's a  real winner!

review/text: *****<br />Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea has the pure, true flavor of ginger and lemongrass---not flavorings. I am not usually a fan of Stash's teas, but this premium tea is as good as much more expensive and higher-end teas. Please make sure you get the ORGANIC GREEN tea version, as it is a different tea (albeit with caffeine) and far superior to Stash's regular lemon ginger herbal tea, in my opinion.<br /><br />Everything in this tea is organic---the organic ginger, the organic green tea, and the organic lemongrass. Although it does contain caffeine, I think it is a much milder green tea, because I tasted the ginger and lemongrass dramatically more than the green tea. This balance made the tea even more enjoyable---a sort of different kind of teasan, one balanced with a little green tea.<br /><br />Stash Tea had their 35th anniversary last month, so they've been around a while, and I love the direction they are moving with their teas, towards more organic and loose teas, more true flavors instead of artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Stash's Organic Premium Lemon Ginger Green Tea unless you do not care for ginger or for spicier teas; otherwise you are certain to be delighted!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Great tea that is also good for you!
review/text: The combination of green and black tea can be tasted in every sip.  The fragrance of bergamot is intoxicating.  The use of organic ingredients also adds to the overall appreciation of the tea.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: We were looking for an organic white mint tea and tried this based on the Amazon reviews.  It is excellent... our new "favorite" tea.  It has the smoothness of a white tea, a tasty mint flavor (peppermint and spearmint), and a clean finish.

review/summary: Great Flavor
review/text: This is my all-time favorite.  I love that it's organic and the mint flavor is very good.  Also, white tea does not stain your teeth the way that some teas do.
