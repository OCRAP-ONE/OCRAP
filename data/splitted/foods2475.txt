review/summary: Planter Dry Roasted Unsalted Peanuts are Delicious!
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ULC3EI">Planters Peanuts, Dry Roasted, Unsalted, 1 lb. 8 oz Jars (Pack of 2)</a><br />This product arrived packed very securely. When I opened the jar, the  aroma of fresh peanuts filled the air after a long swish of the air exchange. The peanuts are fresh and delicious.  I can use a few and close the lid and the rest remain as fresh as they were a few weeks ago.<br />I would recommend the Planters Dry Roasted  Unsalted Peanuts to anyone who wants a fresh and nutritious snack.

review/summary: Best Coffee Ever!
review/text: I have not tasted a better coffee than Peet's Major Dickason's. I first tasted it in the Walnut Street Peet's store in Berkeley, CA in 1980. It has been the only coffee I drink since. Buy it where ever you can get it, Peet's are almost everywhere now (and Safeway sells it too, sometimes for less than eight dollars for a 12oz bag!)<br /><br />YUMMY

review/summary: Truly an outstanding coffee
review/text: I, like most avid coffee drinkers, have tried hundreds (if not thousands) of coffees and Peet's (along with Gevalia Coffee and a good cup of Kona) are among my favorites. Peet's is very robust and full bodied without being acidic like Starbucks.  Very strong, powerful flavor, yet not bitter or burnt tasting.  Major's is truly one of the world's special coffees, just a little pricey for me to drink all the time.

review/summary: Kicks Starbucks Butt
review/text: I've never been a huge fan of the overpriced coffee at Starbucks, even if I am in the minority...to me, it's just too bitter, and way overpriced for what it really is. It's just coffee, folks, no matter how you dress it up (and I prefer just cream and sugar).<br /><br />Being from Canada and loving the smoothness of Tim Horton's coffee (indeed, I bring back as much as I can when I'm home visiting), I have always tried other coffees in neighborhoods I've lived in around the US, hoping to find something local that I like just as much.<br /><br />When I arrived in the San Francisco area a few years ago, I tried Peet's, and enjoyed it enough that when the coffee became available in local grocery stores, I tried the different types.<br /><br />Major Dickenson's has a robust flavor, and no bitter aftertaste, as mentioned by another reviewer...and I was so missing it after leaving San Francisco, I was overjoyed to discover that it is now available in a local grocery store here in Tennessee...It's not too strong, nor too weak, when brewed to your taste...I use a heaping tablespoon per 2 cups of water, and it comes out just right in my 4-cup coffee maker.<br /><br />Peet's is my favorite US brand, replacing Dunkin' Donuts, which I enjoyed when I lived in the Boston area, but when that became available in grocery stores, I bought a bag to compare to Peet's. I was surprised to taste how much weaker it tasted, and that it took more coffee to brew it to the strength I liked.<br /><br />Since I currently have a can of Tim's at home, I'm taking Major Dickason's blend to work with me to share....

review/text: This coffee is rich and flavorful without being too strong or bitter. It's smooth and well balanced and the flavor is just perfect. I followed the instructions on the bag; two level tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water and made it in my drip coffee maker. It's probably the best coffee I've had in a long time. I will definitely be buying this brand again.

review/summary: Inferior to what Peet's used to produce. Try a local roaster.
review/text: When I lived in the San Francisco Bay Area, I discovered Peet's coffee. At that time, it was still a small, local roaster. I loved their "Viennese Blend," and used to drink it daily and serve it to guests; it had a wonderful aroma and rich, almost chocolatey flavor. I moved away, but continued to buy that coffee when I was on the West Coast and order it by mail... until one day it disappeared from the Web site.<br /><br />I then found out what happened: Peet's was attempting to transform itself from a high quality local roaster into a competitor of Starbuck's, to be carried by major supermarket chains such as Safeway. Maybe the Viennese Blend required an extra penny to make, or took an extra second of time, or wasn't suited for huge mass production. But for whatever reason, the company was discontinuing its best coffee in favor of inferior alternatives such as this one.<br /><br />"Major Dickason's Blend" is roughly on a par with some of the better Starbuck's blends you also see in third party stores. This coffee isn't horrible,  but it's just nothing to write home about. It's not worth a premium price. If Amazon had half stars, I'd rate it about 3.5 out of 5. I've switched to a local roaster where I live who is willing to take the time to duplicate the care and effort that Peet's put into its products back in the day, before it went all mass market.

I purchased another item along with this one and who ever packaged this put a box in the middle of a shipping box and put the chex mix on the sides (as if they were packaging cushions)!  Who does Amazon have working in their shipping department?  Obviously not a lot of common sense.  I will not buy this product again.. or any other "fragile" items!

review/summary: Very Good French Roast
review/text: This is excellent French roast coffee.  It's not over roasted/burnt tasting & the flavor is complex.  The beans are oily, black & I found no quakers (underdeveloped coffee beans that make coffee taste awful - they stick out because they do not roast/darken properly).  That's a good test of coffee beans:  empty the bag on a cookie sheet & see how many quakers you find.  A few is "acceptable" but more than 10 is pretty bad in my opinion.<br /><br />I have also tried Cameron's Organic French Roast.  It is equally good but perhaps a little less intense.  For those who don't care for Starbucks French Roast - (I personally find it over roasted/burnt but ok) you may want to give this coffee a try.  If you prefer light roasted coffee or supermarket brands, both of these French roasts may not be your cup of coffee.<br /><br />I use the "pour-over" method to brew coffee every day because at this time, there is only one non-commercial drip coffeemaker that gets water to the ideal brewing temperature of 192F to 204 F.  I use cold, filtered water, a Melitta natural brown filter, manual drip coffee filter & brew directly into my stainless carafe.  I heat the water to boiling, pour a few tablespoons over the grounds to saturate & plump up the beans, wait a couple minutes & then flood the grounds with the rest of the water.  There is a lot of crema, the beautiful reddish brown foam that develops on top of the beans, & it smells & tastes wonderful.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CFLIL">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EN8DMU">Copco 2 Quart Thermal Capacity Brushed Stainless Steel Carafe</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUDDTY">RSVP Manual Drip Coffee Filter Cone for Carafes or Thermos</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012S1V2A">Oster 5965 Stainless-Steel 1-1/2-Liter Electric Water Kettle</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043095WW">Bodum Bistro Electric Burr Coffee Grinder, Black</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>

review/text: I have been purchasing this 32-ounce bag of whole beans for the past few months. It is by far the best tasting dark roast coffee on Amazon for the value. Having tried many other brands as alternatives to Starbucks French and Italian roasts (my favorite), which tend to get expensive if you drink as much coffee as I do, I have found Cameron's to be the most consistent in terms of freshness and taste. The beans have a dark, oily finish which makes for a pretty stout cup of coffee. Again, it doesn't compare to Starbucks, but at about $10 for a 32-ounce bag, you cannot beat it.

I actually found myself liking it and think I will continue to buy it...  I use this in my Keurig My K-cup (with an added grommet to help the seal) and it is as good if not better than many of the Keurig extra bold coffees at a much reduced cost... Definitely worth your giving it a try...<br /><br />Update:  I am on my second bag and this coffee has really grown on me - I find I now prefer it to Starbucks and actually everything else I've tried.

review/text: I have a capresso machine and love french roast coffee.  Cameron's organic is good, but not nearly as good as Starbucks French Roast.  The best beans I have tried are the French Roast from Steaming Bean Coffee Company in Colorado.

review/summary: Great Coffee and WAY cheaper than Starbucks!
review/text: My husband and I both drink plenty of coffee and we like it strong.  Starbucks coffee is so expensive so being the bargain hunter I am, I decided to try this one.  I was pleasantly surprised ... it is good, strong coffee for a fraction of the price, especially w/ Amazon's subscribe and save program!  Highly recommended!

review/text: Another homerun for Cameron's. This Whole Bean Intense French Coffee was more than I expected. By that I mean the taste was intensly good!<br />I really enjoy being able to grind my own coffee beans. The first things I noticed with Cameron's was just how fresh they tasted.<br />I will be back for more that's for sure.

review/summary: Cameron's Intense French Roast Coffee
review/text: Being a "gourmet" coffee lover since the mid-80's, my two favorite roasts were French and Kenya AA.  Recently, as brands have changed I've been unable to find one that recaptures the aroma and flavor of those early favorites.  In the case of French Roast, my search is over. Cameron's Intense French is just what 'normal' French used to be.  If you like bold flavored French Roast, you won't be disappointed.

Cameron's score high marks for taste,richness and smoothness. This is a full bodied cup of coffee that's good any time of day. At fifteen dollars for a 32 oz bag this an outstanding value. This one will be high on my list of preferences. This is one reason I continue to make the majority of coffee purchases from Amazon.

It is definitely the best green tea I have ever tasted---green tea as it always should be---full of flavor and freshness!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Simply Decaf Green Tea comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site, yogitea.com, is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />According to Yogi Tea, this tea is 100% organic and is intended to enhance the immune system and to fight fatigue by providing antioxidants. Note that Yogi makes a Simply Green Tea, too, that contains 58mg of caffeine (compared to 90mg in an 8oz cup of coffee).<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: Despite Amazon sending me a replacement order for these, they still came broken (I can only guess that the manufacturer sends them already broken and it's not Amazon's fault).<br /><br />Also, these are NOT spring rolls but rice crackers that you either bake, microwave or fry (they puff up and it's fun to watch them turn into puffy crackers from flat rice paper). One rice cracker round takes about 2 minutes on high in the microwave to puff into a big rice cracker. Children would definitely get a kick out of watching these magically morph into funky rice bonnets (they look like Amish hats to me once they transform).<br /><br />Unfortunately, these were a little on the stale tasting side but still edible with some dips or fillings.<br /><br />I'm curious to try the shrimp ones as my Korean friend told me that those actually have the best flavor.

I find myself using two tea bags to get a decent mug of tea.<br /><br />Even worse, the bags are not great. Most of them have small holes in them, allowing the tea to leak out. I've taken to grabbing my trusty office stapler, locating the hole, and stapling it closed before brewing the tea. Because of this, I will not be repurchasing.

review/summary: Quite tasty with a decent nutritional profile
review/text: I tend to have quick breakfasts on the run before work in the mornings, so I often rely on quick, easy foods like bars.  However, I avoid traditional breakfast bars, which tend to be high in sugar and have little-to-no protein.  Rather, I want something that is going to start my day with a better nutritional value AND contain a decent amount of protein to keep me feeling full longer.  The other problem is that it's breakfast--I don't want chocolate!  Maybe true chocoholics eat chocolate at any time of the day, but I prefer something a bit more appropriate to the morning hours.<br /><br />So, after Slim-Fast changed their bars on me (loved their old Oatmeal Raisin Optima bars, but really don't like the new version), I decided to try these meal replacement bars by Special K in Honey Almond.  First of all, when I checked out the box, these bars met my nutritional requirements.  They have 10 grams of protein, which is almost as much as some bars specifically billed as protein/energy bars.  They are a good source of fiber as well, with 5 grams.  Also, the sugar is relatively low at 12 grams (just over 2 teaspoons).  Finally, although the fat content is a bit higher than I would have liked (6 grams), these bars contain only 2.5 grams saturated fat (no trans fat), so most of the fat is probably healthy fats from the almonds.<br /><br />Of course, the final test of these bars is the taste:  they are yummy!  They are chewy, with a pleasant almond-y flavor that is not too sweet (an unfortunately problem that I've found with so many bars I have tried).  These have become one of my new breakfast staples, and I definitely recommend them.

I have not gotten tired of the meal replacement bars at all.<br /><br />I would recommend these bars to anyone trying to follow a diet.

review/text: These bars are OK.  They are better than many diet bars, but not as good as most in the Special line.  The picture on the box is deceiving.  There is no white layer on the bottom of the bar.  It is just made up of what is on pictured as the top layer- with a thin milky honey-like coating on the bottom and drizzled over the top.  I do not find them as satisfying as the chocolate peanut butter bars.

review/summary: Darker than expected
review/text: I loved the flavor and strength of the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend.  Since the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend was not available on Amazon, I shopped for the next best thing.  I thought it would be a great idea to purchase the 1/2 caff, and perhaps I would get the same great flavor, same milder coffee and quality as the regular Green Mountain I was used to (with half the caffine).  WRONG.  Although still a perfectly drinkable coffee, the 1/2 caff seems to be a darker roast and not nearly as mild as the fully caffinated Breakfast Blend. Actually tasted bitter, as compared to it's fully caffinated counterpart. Priced well and free shipping as an Amazon Prime member, so that's a plus. I won't throw it out, but did go right out shopping for the Breakfast Blend I was used to.  This box of Half-Caff will be for "emergency" use for me.

This coffee does do the job.<br /><br />The only negative is a matter of my own taste.  I MUCH prefer dark roasted coffee, and this is definitely light-to-medium.  Tastes like Denny's coffee.  Just fine, not earth-shattering...<br /><br />My very favorite K-cup coffee is Obsidian (by Caribou) - to get a sense of what I wished it tasted like!

review/summary: Love this K-Cup flavor!
review/text: I've been percolating coffee for 30+ years. To me, there is nothing like a percolator for a really good, HOT cup of coffee. However, even though I only drank two cups per day, if I missed my morning java, I would get one of those 'caffeine headaches;' not very pleasant. So, about 10 years ago, I started mixing equal parts of regular and decaffeinated coffee, thus solving my problem; I could still get a little caffeine boost without the withdrawal. Then we got a Keurig at work, and while I really liked the convenience, I didn't want to go back to 100% caffeineated coffee. I tried two different decaf K-Cup flavors and they were terrible. Then I heard about Half-Caff. It's delicious; a perfect blend of caffeine & decaf, and dare I say, just as good as my percolated coffee, which I never imagined. Actually, I have to say its better because of the convenience. In short, because of Half-Caff, I bought a Keurig for my house, and Half-Caff is the only flavor K-Cup I use (I don't like flavored coffee) Highly recommended! Well, gotta go have my coffee now...

I got no headache or any other side-effects from caffeine withdrawal. I will probably purchase this in the future.

review/text: I normally drink half-caff and am very pleased with it, but after trying a sample of the Tully's French Roast decaf that came in a variety pack, I was truly AMAZED at the flavor.  I anticipated it being bland, not much taste but I was sooo wrong.  The flavor is so rich and robust that a couple times I checked the box to confirm it was actually decaffinated! Although I will continue to drink the half-caf, this product has taken the #1 spot on my coffee list!

review/text: I see K-cups everywhere but not these. Found them once a while ago and haven't been able to replenish till now. I love these because although i am a coffee fiend (they did a blood test a while ago and found 90% coffee) I want to have these when I only need one cup and really don't want to be anything more than semi-concious. They are great for people who get the shakes from coffee also. I prefer really brewed pots of coffee but these are a great substitute when I only have time for a cup and really need to get back to sleep in a couple of hours. Great taste, expensive like all K cups but not bad if you only drink a couple of cups. Well worth keeping on hand.

review/text: I've been drinking this coffee for a few months now and it's not my first choice in terms of taste but it still tastes good and it's helped lower my caffeine intake which is what I am mainly concerned with.  I switched to this coffee after I found out I was pregnant and was told to have no more than 200mg of caffeine a day.  I emailed the company directly at the time and was told that "The relative caffeine content in a 6oz brewed cup of Half Caff is 48-53mg" so it met my needs perfectly! I would recommend this product if you're not looking to give up coffee altogether but still want to reduce your intake.

review/text: we've been devout Folgers coffee drinkers for over 35 years and never thought we'd switch brands. after my husband had a bout of heart problems, he was told to go to decaf coffee or stop drinking it, which wasn't an option. we started buying the Folgers half caff and he cut back to 2 cups a day. when i bought the keurig coffee maker <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B70 Platinum Brewing System</a> i switched to the Green Mountain Breakfast Blend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006N3I29E">Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend, 24-Count K-Cup for Keurig Brewers</a> (love it) and bought the ekobrew refillable k-cup <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064A7SRS">Ekobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREEN</a> for him and his Folgers half-caff.<br /><br />on a whim, i decided to buy a small box of the Green Mountain half-caff k cups for him to try. i was very nervous about it because he's such a die-hard Folgers kind of guy. since i don't care for decaff coffee i didn't want to have to drink it if he didn't like it. he took a couple big drinks of the coffee and i finally asked him how he liked it. he said he liked it a lot, and thought it was much better than the Folgers half-caff, it seemed to have a lot more flavor. phew!<br /><br />in fairness to Folgers half-caff ground coffee, the reason he may think the Green Mountain half-caff has more flavor could be because of how much of the Folgers he used to make a cup. with these refillable k-cups it doesn't seem to be an exact science, so one cup could be a bit stronger or weaker than the next. i think this is what he was saying. because the Green Mountain k-cups are accurately pre-measured, you get the same taste in every cup.<br /><br />the bottom line is, he loves the Green Mountain half-caff coffee, and we will definitely be buying more of it. i asked him if he wanted to try the Folgers half-caff keurig coffee and he said, "ummm, i don't know". for a hard-core coffee drinker to be ok with that kind of change says a lot about the GM half-caff coffee. as least it speaks to me of how great this coffee is.
