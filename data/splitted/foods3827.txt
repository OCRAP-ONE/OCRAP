review/summary: Need can opener.
review/text: This is a high guality food that a friend of mine advised me to try. It is a little on the expensive side, but my cat seems to love it. I usually mix it with a little warm water and make it into a paste. The only thing holding it back is you need a can opener.

review/summary: My cat's favorite flavor
review/text: My cat absolutely loves this flavor. Normally, I have to coax her to finish her food, but when I give her a serving of Chicken & Herring, the bowl is clean in like five minutes. I do not understand why some of the other reviewers blamed the company for selling them bad cans--their cats probably just prefer another flavor. I say experiment to see what your cat will eat, and stay away from cat food with grains in it!

review/text: She LOVES this food.  Licks her bowl clean.  I think it's a very quality product. Canned food was recommended for her by our veterinarian (who only sees cats). . . who said it's closer to what they would "naturally" eat.  It makes me wonder if Wellness should consider "Mouse" flavor along with Turkey and Salmon!

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

Not only did this solve all those issues, but he now has the most silkiest, softest, shiniest fur. The quantity of food intake has also decreased. No more begging for food every 5 minutes. Another bonus - my cat now has a lean and toned body that I'm envious of.<br />This product will save you a lot of trips to the vet!!!

review/summary: Good, healthy food
review/text: Did some googling on kitten nutrition and found that the food I was feeding my kitten did not have very high water content and that she was supposed to be eating a meat based food (grain is no good for cats).  This food seemed to match well with what google told me, and I've been feeding her this wet food for 2 months now.  She seems to like the food and she looks great.  She seemed pretty healthy before as well, but there was a noticeable difference after I switched her food.  Her coat is shinier and softer, she's more energetic, and has been maintaining a good weight.  I wish it wasn't so expensive, but I think its worth the price and I will keep buying it.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

review/summary: Positive for Wellness
review/text: My background is 50 years of dog/cat owner and college degree in chemistry so I'm not completely ignorant about pet nutrition. After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

Yesterday was the first time we tried the Salmon and Trout flavor, and absolutely none of them would touch it. They left it in their dishes all day and went hungry.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars, because overall Wellness is better than anything else out there. Just be sure to test out the different flavors on your cats before committing to any bulk orders.

This Wellness Canned food is very fresh and (according to the experts) has all the healthy nutrition cats need. I've tried a few different brands and this one gives my cats the best soft, full coat and even makes their poop smell less (super bonus!). It's pricier, but give it a shot.

review/summary: Good Cat Food Without Smelly Cans
review/text: What self-respecting cat isn't a picky eater?  I've never met any.  My cat likes Whiskas Choice Cut foods mainly for the gravy, and sometimes for the meat.  Omar the Magnificent and Wonderful likes both  the Beef in Gravy or Tuna.  Truth be told his dry crunchie is really his go-to choice, but he's that way with all prepared moist foods.  If you ask him his true five-star preference is meat caught fresh in  the garden.  Let's skip the details, you don't want to know.... Let's just say that Omar (M&W) is on the job!<br /><br />I personally prefer Whiskas foods in pouches because Omar is OK with allowing any remaining food to be left in pouch when stored in fridge, rather than having to transfer it from a can to a glass container.  (Come on you all have cats that expect you to do this!)  Pouches are easy to dispose of too.  Just rinse and trash.  You aren't messing with storing smelling cans and trips to the recycling center.

review/text: Both my cats love Whiskas in any flavor.  My female cat, Sophie, is usually the one that takes little bits until it is gone.  When she hears me tearing the Whiskas Pouches, she flys into the kitchen and waits patiently for her food.  She never lifts her head up from the bowl until every piece is gone.  She will then sit by her brother, Samson, to get more food if he leaves.  After he gulps his food down and see's his Sissy waiting for some of his, he will tease her by taking one piece of his food out with his paw, look at her and when she trys to take it away he puts his paw on it and scoops it into his mouth. i can always count on empty bowls when I buy Whiskas.  The price at Amazon is more reasonable than the grocery store.

review/summary: Tasty food for a picky cat
review/text: Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: "She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years."<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether.

There's a lot of gravy so the price is pretty high considering the amount of liquid.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Cat Food Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a> are more expensive and very similar.<br /><br />I have these on Subscribe and Save so the price is pretty good.  Based upon my cats reaction, they really like this food.

review/summary: Poor quality ingredients, but my cat loves it.
review/text: I bought this product because my older cat stopped eating the wellness dry and wet food I usually fed her.  She likes this food and she begs for it every morning and evening when it is time for her meal.  The ingredients are not quality ingredients but this food is keeping my kitty satisfied.

review/text: I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!

review/summary: The best balance of heat and flavor
review/text: This is my favorite hot sauce. I have been using it for almost 15 years. Put as much or as little as you need on your favorite food. It's hot, but not all heat. It has a distinctive flavor that I have not been able to find in any other hot sauce. This sauce has artificial coloring and preservatives in it, which I both like and don't like. So it's not 100% natural, but it has a neat green color and it doesn't need to be refrigerated. I never leave home without it!

review/summary: Spicy and delicious!!
review/text: This sauce has a great Mexican taste beyond its peppery fire, and the color, even though created by dyes, is just plain fun to look at. The splash of green on red sauces, fresh veggies, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, it goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use.

review/summary: Ethical company AND a great brew - what more could you want?!
review/text: Our household only buys Fair Trade coffee, and as many will know it can be difficult to find much selection. I am SO happy to have found BuyWell! To start with, it's just great coffee - there's a good range of milder to darker roasts, and so far every one I've tried (three different blends) has been fabulous. Add in the fact that it's Fair Trade AND Organic, and I'm even happier - and to cap it off, the bags I have seen are stamped with the Green E (the company buys 100% certified renewable energy). I don't think I need to look any more - we have found our coffee supplier!<br /><br />I have to say, however, that I'm a little surprised at Amazon's prices - I can get four different blends in my local supermarket (HEB, in Houston, TX) for $6.99 per 12oz bag - I'm surprised Amazon can't beat this. I'd love to put this on my Subscribe and Save list - but while the prices are so much better in-store I think I'll stick to buying it there. I'll quickly add, however, that this coffee is worth the Amazon price if you can't get it elsewhere! Give it a try - you won't regret it.

The mix is chock full of very good noodles and vegetables in an excellent broth. I added a generous cup of cubed, already cooked chicken strips to up the protein content for a full meal. Serve the soup plus a salad with some really good bread, and you're good to go. This mix puts the big name brands to shame.

review/text: This soup puts all other dried soups to shame. It is absolutely delicious. It reminds me of Boston Market Chicken Noodle Soup and up until now, this was my standard of comparision for all Chicken Noodle Soups. I did add some cooked chicken to the soup after it was cooked, but is was tasty and hearty even without it. The noodles cook up nice and firm and are not pasty like some tend to be. They are nice broad noodles that have a good mouth-feel. Enjoy!

We usually add a little chicken to the mix and maybe some extra peas and onions to taste. With or without additions, it is a tasty wholesome soup. We're always surprised at how big and plump the noodles become after cooking.

review/text: I've been baking bread for my family for 15 years. This flour is darker than I expected, towards whole-wheat I would say. I tend to combine this with a whiter flour, maybe this would be 1/5th of mix. The bread comes out darker, textured, full of flavor. The flour rises well even when I use a higher proportion (tried 2/3rds). I wish Great River had a whiter flour that I can buy together with this one. I'm not sure I would use it for pastries, unless I sifted it myself.

review/summary: Excellent coffee in convenient mini-bricks.
review/text: This Gran Filtro is my favorite so far of the Lavazza coffees I have tried (Rosso, gold can, black can espressos).  While the other three were made for espresso, I used them instead to make regular coffee in the Cuisinart coffee maker.  They were all good, but seemed to lack a bit of... something, perhaps because they were meant to be extracted in an espresso machine rather than dripped through a coffeemaker.  For those, I used seven tablespoons of coffee to one quart of water.  I figured with these mini-bricks I would have to adjust the amount of water I used, but I didn't.  One of these with a quart of water suits my taste perfectly.  Since I choose not to grind my own beans, I love that each of these little 2.25-oz. vacuum packs is good for one pot, so the pre-ground coffee isn't getting stale overnight.  I would like it if Amazon would offer the dark roast variety of Gran Filtro in the 2.25-oz. size, as well.

review/text: My husband is self-employed and has his own construction company -- coffee is a fundamental staple to his survival! We have been looking everywhere for pre-measured coffee that has a nice bold flavor -- the regular old Colombian you get in restaurants is OK, but he is a Kona / espresso fan, so we needed something with a little more "oomph." These packages are the perfect size to just open, dump in, and make his coffee in the morning. No more grinding or mess, and because they are vacuum sealed they are always fresh. And Lavazza has a nice aroma and taste. We will be buying these pretty regularly from now on.

No chemicals here.<br /><br />I e-mailed Oskri because there seemed to be a discrepency on their nutritional info on different sites. So if you were confused too, here's the deal. They recently switched to using real fruit like strawberry, mango, etc in their flavored bars. They said this does, however, add to the total amount of sugar in the bar. So unfortunately there is more sugar in the flavored bars, but the trade off is you are getting real fruit and it tastes better, and the plain bars still have lower sugar content if you are concerned with that. The strawberry flavoring is worth the extra sugar for me, though.

review/summary: Great snack
review/text: I love these coconut bars so much that I buy a box monthly on Subscribe & Save. I am on a gluten-free and dairy-free diet so these satisfy my sweet tooth. Each bar consists of coconuts 59%, rice syrup 37%, strawberries 4%. 246 total calories; 12g saturated fat which I assume comes from the coconut oil; 29g sugar which is a lot probably from the rice syrup. Allergy advice says "may contain traces of nuts and sesame seeds." They may not be the healthiest food out there but if this is the worst of the junk food I eat, then so be it.

review/summary: Tastes like coconut not so much strawberry
review/text: The bar tastes good but not as strawberry as I imagined it would. I still enjoy the bar, but mango tastes better and that would be a 4-5 stars. If you like coconut this is a good snack bar. I eat these while hiking or working in the yard. They provide good healthy energy and taste delicious. I do not believe I would order strawberry again but I still enjoy the product.

review/summary: NOT jasmine pearls
review/text: The tea that is described is "jasmine pearl tea", and so is the image that accompanies this item. the tea is in fact NOT jasmine pearl tea, but rather an almost comicaly (and somewhat insulting) inferior grade of tea. if jasmine tea still has flowers in it, it's what you might call "bottom of the barrel" tea. that's what was sent to me, not the coveted jasmine pearls that are described and shown.<br />I can't help but feel a little bit DUPPED by the whole transaction, and I likely won't be purchasing anything from this seller ever again.<br />once more, BEWARE: THE PRODUCT DESCRIBED AND PICTURED ABOVE IS MISLEADINGLY INCORRECT. this tea is NOT jasmine pearl, it's low grade full leaf tea. I'm saddened by the fact that I purchased a whole pound of this stuff. you've been warned :)

review/summary: Gave me a boost when I needed it
review/text: I had a very long day. Got to work early, worked about nine hours, headed for the airport and had to go through a connecting flight and about 5 hours of travel. And when I got home I still had some work to do and needed a boost to get me through it.<br /><br />After hearing a radio ad for this product, I picked up a two-pack and used one of them when I got home.<br /><br />It promised five hours of energy without crashing. I can't attest to the five hours (didn't quite pay attention), but it did last for quite a while and I had no crash effect in the end. I wasn't overly anxious or nervous, but I could think clearly and get the work done that I needed to get done. So it most definately delivers on its promises.<br /><br />The things that I like the most is the fact that there is no sugar. I also appreciate the fact that they use water instead of carbonated water, which is the main reason I don't like the Monsters, Rockstar, Red Bull, etc products (diet versions, of course). It also gives all this energy in 2 ounces instead of having to drink a large soda can worth of drink. The taste wasn't fantastic, but it could have been much worst and only takes a good gulp to get it all down.<br /><br />I've been looking for a product like this to get me going in the mornings and this seems to fit the bill. My only problem with this is that it is a bit on the pricey side. Today I am also trying out one that is similar, called Enduroshot, a 2.2 ounce energy shot that claims all the same benefits that this promises but at a MUCH lower price. I'll do a review on that sometime soon in the future. If I feel just as awake and alert as I do with 5-hour energy, then I will use it instead. Otherwise, Chaser has a new, steady customer.

No over-stimulation as it only has the caffeine equivalent of 1 cup of jo. It is also SUGAR FREE and has 0 Net Carbs!! I do feel the energy quickly & it lasts the 5 hours it claims.  The berry flavor is pleasant, but tart so I drink some water as a "chaser" (no pun intended).  I drink water the rest of the day & only use 1 in the morning unless I have a "late" meeting scheduled.

review/summary: Pretty Good - I recommend
review/text: I'm currently having a cup of this coffee right now at the breakfast table before eating (on a relaxed Saturday morning when I can take my time and really enjoy this meal with my wife.)  Before having this cup, I just finished a cup of Hawaiian coffee that was good but wasn't Kona.  This cup was too mild and smooth for my tastes.  I grind all of my coffee beans at home.  I like to have one cup of caffeinated coffee first and then follow this with one cup of decaffeinated coffee every morining.  The caffeinated coffees that I like include Kirkland's Guatemala and Ruwanda and Starbucks French Roast.  I like strong, bold flavorful coffee.  I also like Trader Joe's Seattle Blend and another very dark French roast that they sell.  I like Kirkland's decaff a little better than the decaff that Trader Joe's sells.  I have tried Trader Joe's Italian Roast decaff and liked it.  In general, I feel that decaffineated coffees are somewhat one dimensional in taste.  They have a good flavor, but it just isn't bold enough to suite me.  But, for a person who wants to limit their caffeine intake, both Kirkland's and Trader Joe's brands are pretty good and I recommend them.<br /><br />After grinding my own Starbucks French Roast for about two years now, I cannot drink Folgers or Maxwell House by themselves anymore.  I used to love their darker coffees but now find that they just don't have enough flavor to suit me anymore.  I use two rounded tablespoons of freshly ground coffee and filtered tap water to make my coffee.  On weekends, I use a french press to get a little more flavor out of that first cup of coffee.  Obviously, I'm not an expert on coffees but I know what I like and Kirkland's decaff is pretty good.  Of the caffeinated, I got tired of Starbucks French Roast after a while.  I like the the Guatemala a lot.  I want to try the Mayorca brand soon.

review/summary: Good quality licorice, so-so aesthetic appeal
review/text: This is good quality REAL licorice (i.e. flavored with real licorice root, unlike most of what passes for black licorice in the US). It's organic, which I guess is good if that matters to you. The gum appeal (chew) is very good: Chewy, not too sticky, and not too soft.<br /><br />The main downside is presentation. It comes as a ~5 bulk packed bag of licorice "pellets" (~3/4" cylinders). It's not unpleasant, and it's not the "sticky clump" the previous reviewer mentioned (perhaps his sat in the heat too long), but no one will be reaching for on the basis of looks...<br /><br />That said, it's good stuff, and it's the real thing.

This product does not behave as belgian pearl sugar. The chunks internal to the waffle batter fail to melt and become crisp pockets of sugar. The pearl sugar exposed to the waffle iron does caramelize well (thus 2 star rating). Unfortunately, this product does not work any better, nor is it more consistent than crushed sugar cubes.

I get twice as more bags for half the price if I bought them at my grocery store.  I enjoy these right out of the bag.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5OVY">Sun Maid Fruit Bits, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Watching your caloric intake and eating foods that taste good is something that is not easy to come by. I like dried fruit but was surprised to learn that some of the dried fruits can be high in calories. After becoming a member of Amazon's Subscribe and Save Plan I decided to order this product. Unfortunately you cannot eat the entire bag at once if you are seriously watching your caloric intake. There are a few servings per bag but I do have to admit that when added to food such as low fat yogurt, low fat cereal, low fat pudding or any other low cal food that you enjoy, the suggested amount goes a long way. These fruit bits are just the thing to perk up any of the above items.  They add just the right amount of chewiness to foods that are ordinarly creamy. This is not saying that foods which have a creamy consistency also don't taste good, but why not add a little something extra that will make them more interesting when it comes to consistency. Not only is this a healthy snack but combining it with other everyday food items kicks those items up a knotch. I tried it with vanilla low cal yogurt and was surprised at how much better the yogurt tasted. I have yet to try these fruit bits in other comparable foods but I am sure that I won't be disappointed.  Will definitely re order this item.
