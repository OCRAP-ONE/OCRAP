review/summary: fabulous!
review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  I'm Chinese and have used this brand for years.  It's easy and foolproof as long as you measure precisely.  Otherwise the tofu will not set properly.  It produces a very silken textured tofu.  If you want firmer, you can press it under a weight for an hour or two.

review/text: We use this all the time to make dessert.  We double the amount of water to make a jello like consistency and pour some caramel syrup on it.<br /><br />Inside the box is the tofu mix and a small packet to make the mixture coagulate.  You just boil it and let it cool in room temperature.<br /><br />Is is just frustrating that it is always unavailable in most of the international grocery stores that we go to.  I just wish that they make it in bigger boxes or pound bags with cheaper prices.

review/summary: Delicious cookies, but not single serving packs
review/text: Let me start by saying that I really like these cookies. If you're going to give your child cookies, these are not so bad healthwise. However, the size leads you to believe that one bag contains a single serving, when it actually contains 2 servings at 120 calories each. That's a bit too many calories in a snack for a young child, I think. I buy snack packs so that when I'm on the go, I can open a bag and hand it to my kid. I don't feel that I can do that with these.

review/text: These don't taste like cardboard, thankfully; they have a pleasant, subtle almost nutty flavor, as if peanut butter is in them. However, the texture, even in the center of the cookie, is not moist at all!! I was hoping the outside would be slightly crunchy while the inside was softer and moist. They also crumble easily. They are alright but nothing I'd purchase again.

review/text: This was another great find on Amazon Grocery!! They are very tasty, crunchy little cookies.  My family has really enjoyed these, they have a great mild chocolate taste and quite the crunch.  Most of the animal crackers/cookies that I've purchased for my family have become dismembered sometime before my children get them out of the package, these are mostly whole and you can really tell what the critter is before you pop it in your mouth ... Extra fun snack time for the little ones.  All in all, the box of cookies is well worth the price and I feel good about packing healthier snacks in my children's backpacks for school.

review/summary: THE Best Healthy Cookies Out There!
review/text: These chocolate chip cookies are addicting! They are the best tasting cookies out there, and they are healthy for you too! They are crisp, fresh, and have an even amount of chocolate vs cookie flavor. They are not animal crackers by any means.<br /><br />The only thing I would suggest is to make sure you have them delivered to some place cool (not to your door step on a hot July day!) as one batch came out a little not-so-crisp, and I'm pretty sure it was because of that.<br /><br />These cookies are almost twice as expensive in the stores where I live if I buy them by the bag. Forget that! I'm sticking with them here on Amazon!<br />Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Did the recipe change?
review/text: I notice that the most positive reviews are from a few years ago, and the most negative reviews are more recent.  We used to buy these in larger containers at the local "healthy supermarket," and my family really liked them.  That was a few years ago.  Now, they sit in the back of the pantry and no one touches them--either the recipe changed or my family's tastes changed.  They are dry, about half of them are broken, and they taste like sweetened cardboard.  (We have the vanilla variety.)  The individual packs are handy for hikes and portable snacks, but I've noticed that they frequently come back unopened.  Guess I'll look for an alternative.

review/summary: VEGANS BEWARE - These contain milk.
review/text: These are delicious and actually have pieces of peanut butter in them. Crunchy but still creamy, and so yummy. However, I didn't check the ingredients before purchasing and assumed that - like the Vanilla, Chocolate Chip and Oatmeal - these would be vegan. They're not - they have whey and milk powder in them. For a non-vegan, these taste great and are a more healthy choice than your standard cookie.<br /><br />For the calorie counters: these have almost 50% more calories per serving than the other Snackimals flavors. Most of the other flavors are 110 calories per 10 cookie serving, and the Peanut Butter are 150 calories per 10 cookie serving.

I do no have kids but when I do these will make it into their lunch  boxes.

review/summary: So good!...........
review/text: One of my carry-over faves from childhood is animal crackers.  I love them.  I'll have to admit I am a big fan of organic items and also am a sucker for clever/cute packaging, so I brought these home tonight to give them a whirl.  Delicious!  These are not a thick animal cracker like nabisco, but a thin crunchy one.  The peanut butter tastes just like a peanut butter cookie should and is not overly sweet.  The package is 7.5 oz and carries 7 servings of 10 cookies for 150 calories (25 from fat).  1 g saturated fat, 2g fiber, 10 g sugar, 3g protein and 2% calcium, and 4% iron.  All natural ingredients, with natural peanut butter, no hydrogenated oils, artificial flavors, additives or preservatives.  I would feel fine eating these or giving to a kid for a sweet snack.  The first ingredients on the label?  Organic unbleached flour and peanut butter.<br /><br />I'm very happy I tried these and will definitely try more of the other cookies in this brand's line.<br /><br />Overall a delicious product, well packaged in a convenient resealable bag.  Perfect for car trips, home or office.  Now you can indulge and feel slightly better about it!

I'm leery of having snacks around and I'm not too fond of having the kid eat a lot of snacks, but my wife assures me that these are relatively healthy snacks. Hmmmmm. I suspect that these are just as much for her as for the boy. Well, what can you do? We already have them and the bag is open. I might as well try one just to see what they're all about. Mmmmmm. Somewhat dry and crunchy. Nice chocolatey taste, but not too heavy. Sweet, but only lightly sweet. Nice snack or treat! Of course, the boy loves them! I'm going to have problems staying away from these.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I like the ingredients and packs are big enough to share with another person.  I bought based on good reviews and found them to be crispy and delicious.  They taste like those little animal crackers you find in the small, red, zoo-like boxes with the string handles I had as a child but these are crispier and better ingredients.  I didn't sense the chocolate chip in the flavor but they are good. Recommend! :)<br /><br />EDIT:  Tried the Oatmeal flavor and was sadly disappointed..2 stars from me. The taste was bland and nothing exceptional for the over-the-top cost.  PLUS...Amazon only lets you review ONE FLAVOR even if you try others.  Obnoxious and deceptive...makes all flavors look 5 star when they are NOT.

review/text: My son has a ton of allergies and there are so few things he can have that are not homeade.  These cookies however have made the list for snack food he can eat being that they are free of peanuts, wheat, soy, treenuts and more.  I have not found an animal cracker on the market that is free of all those allergens.  usually they at least have soy. the bigger deal for me though is that these things are GOOD! I tried them and love them.  I don't eat them of course but the majority of the allergy free food I try of my sons, i dont' really like.  I'd never eat them more than once. these though I coudl definately.  My other son loves them too. It is so great to find a snack food for a small child with allergies that he can take to school and be like every one else.

review/summary: Really tasty cookies despite confusing reviews
review/text: I'm not sure if there was a bad batch of these sent out in 2011 or something, but the bag I bought for my son on 5/27/12 was really quite good. If you're familiar with the Nature Valley Oat and Honey granola bars, the oatmeal Barbara's Snackimals taste almost exactly like those, only they're much neater to eat and easier to chew since they're thinner and smaller. Yes, the cookies have a tendency to break, but they taste *great*. My son (2 1/2) loved them, and even his two cousins (6 and 2 1/2), who get more sugary treats than he did, helped to demolish the bag. All the adults were a bit jealous, I think--the Snackimals were much tastier than our potato chips . . .

review/text: The Barbara's snackimals are an unexpected surprise.<br />These cookies come in a 2 servings per bag package at 2.25oz each which in perspective is more mass than a 99cent bag of chips at Subway et al. So relatively satisfying portion if eating as intended, 1 bag at a time.<br /><br />Delicious oaty flavor, tasting of molasses and vanilla, 2 of their few ingredients, these cookies are crispy.  Yet they chew down to goo just like the old-fangled animal crackers with the carnival packaging.<br /><br />I feel good about buying them, relatively snacking, and I feel good about consuming them, again, relatively speaking.<br />Recommended in all ways, no drawbacks that I have discovered yet.

review/text: Being a natural, somewhat healthy cookie, I expected a carob-y cardboard flavor.  Not so!  While you can see very small specks of chocolate, I think most of the chocolate flavor comes from the pale brown swirls throughout the cookie.  The chocolate is far more flavorful than you would imagine.  They are simply wonderful, cute little cookies.

review/text: These are great animal crackers. My kids all love them. It's great to have a portable snack that my chemically-sensitive kids can eat. These are going to be great to bring on picnics, to the park, on car trips, etc.<br /><br />The biggest quibble I have is that the "snack-size" bags are a little too large for younger kids (pre-schoolers or kindergartners) to finish at one sitting. If I send a bag in with my kindergartner for snack time, even though he loves them he can't finish them all. About 1.5 oz would be plenty for young kids.<br /><br />Ironically, they are cheaper per ounce in the snack size bags than in the larger boxes. You'd expect it to be the other way around.<br /><br />I'll definitely be ordering more of these.

review/summary: Good quality product, but the flavor is not what I had hoped
review/text: First, this is a good quality product: they use quality ingredients and the crackers have a nice "animal cracker" crunchy texture. Flavor is such a subjective thing that I hate to down-rate a high quality product too much just on that basis. But I won't be ordering any more of these.<br /><br />My oldest son says they don't have enough cinnamon to achieve a strong cinnamon flavor, but too much to achieve just a hint of cinnamon flavor. I think they actually have the right amount of cinnamon, but aren't quite sweet enough, especially on the exterior. They just come across a little bit bland. I know a lot of people say that is just because people are used to over-sweetened foods, but I think the chocolate chip flavor Snackimals have just the right amount of sweetness. In any case, my kids don't like them - but they do like the chocolate chip flavor.

Ingredients are quite good and per bag price is very reasonable--even more so on auto-delivery.  Large 2+ ounce single servings are quite satisfying when you want something slightly sweet and crunchy with only 120 calories and modest fat content. The only change we have made to our auto-delivery schedule is to have them shipped more frequently.

review/summary: Flavor Not What I Was Expecting
review/text: I purchased these based on a recommendation from the Hungry Girl emails as a great low fat snack.  These are ok, but the flavor is definitely not what I was expecting, there is almost a burnt quality to the flavor.  Also, the serving size doesn't seem like that much since the cookies are very thin.  For similar nutritionals you can have about the same amount of Keebler Elfin Crackers, which are much more tasty and satisfying.  If you liked the McDonaldland Cookies as a kid, go for the Elfin Crackers, they are very similar in flavor.

review/summary: These taste so bland.
review/text: Look, each pack contains two servings of 120 cal each, yet those servings serve up exactly zero taste.  They should make it one serving of the same number of calories but inject some taste.  They taste like someone forgot 1) salt and 2)sugar.  Wow.  Super bad.

review/summary: dissapointed
review/text: not what i expected.. I tried vanilla version at my neighbour's - they were soft and nice.. but they were also in a bigger bag (8 oz or so). These cookies (oatmeal) come in small pouches (2 oz or so) and they are stone hard, too salty, no taste appeal whatsoever. The same I can say for the chocolate version. Nobody in our family wants a bite of them - waste of money.

review/text: I was really excited for this because my friend is a Hershey's Kiss fan girl. It was going to be her christmas present. I had heard from other people that it was really good and since it's hollow she didn't feel bad about eating the whole thing.<br />So in excitement for getting my friend the ultimate present I ordered it. It has been a few weeks, and it HASN'T COME. It's ordered through amazon which was connected to the Hershey site.<br />I'm disappointed, and my friend is sad :(

review/summary: Magnifico
review/text: I have tried many olive oils.  I respect olio like others respect fine wine.  I do not exagerate when I say this is the best I have ever tasted.  My wife brought a bottle home from Italy.  When I tasted it I was hooked.  I have paid as much as US$50.00 for a bottle when I couldn't find it anywhere else.  People think nothing of spending US$100.00 for a bottle of wine that is consumed in one sitting.  This olive oil is worth much more and lasts much longer. If you love olio like I do, treat yourself; beware however, there is no going back.  Enjoy!!<br /><br />Robert Keefer

review/summary: excellent as a gift
review/text: I was never drawn to the taste of olive oil until I had this alongside several other fine olive oils at a local gourmet grocer's public tasting. This is now the only olive oil I would seek out for a special occasion or gift, and it made a friend quite happy last year as a birthday present. I would happily have this every day if cost were not an issue, even simply having it by itself.

review/summary: What happened?
review/text: I bought 10 bottles of Mystic mango carrot juice drink recently (the last two-three weeks) and the taste has completely changed. The wonderful flavor I grew accustomed to is no longer the same. The bottle shape has changed somewhat.  Has the flavor deliberately been changed as well? I hope this is not the case. It has a somewhat fishy taste to me now.  I hope I just bought a bad batch and that this is not how this wonderful juice drink I came to love to drink will now taste. A few weeks ago, I would have rated this juice drink a level 5, but since the flavor change I rate it a level 1.  Sorry, but please bring the good flavor back!

review/summary: A pleasant cup of tea
review/text: I have seen some reviews of pod teas that said it was impossible to get a good cup of tea out of a pod brewer because the tea is not allowed to simmer.  My own experience is that this is not true.  I have tried two varieties of tea pods since I purchased my Bunn brewing machine.  The Earl Grey Black tea did not suit my taste.  This English Breakfast was more to my taste.  I was mainly using Orange Pekoe and Earl Grey tea bags before I went to the pods.  I find that this Organa tea is a perfectly good, and faster brewed, replacement for the tea bags.

review/text: I bought a box of this and was rather skeptical about it--boy was I wrong.  I have made awesome fried chicken and onion rings using this coating.  Hubby doesn't have to eat GF but even he said they were some of the best onion rings he'd ever had.  To give it a little more "kick" I add a little bit of garlic powder and seasoned salt, and soak the chicken or onions in buttermilk, and once in a while put a little bit of hot sauce in the buttermilk.  This was definitely a worthwhile purchase for me.

review/text: I picked up a box of this flour at a closeout store not knowing anything about it or the company and now I'm HOOKED. All the products from this company that I've tried have been wonderful.<br /><br />This seasoned flour, IMO, is seasoned perfectly. Not too much, not too little. Tastes JUST like my grandma used to make. Follow the directions and let the coated chicken rest and the flour 'set' and you'll get the best, crunchiest breading that doesn't fall off during cooking. I've tried it on pan fried and baked chicken and both were fantastic. Looking forward to trying it on fried okra!

review/text: I bought this for my son why loves fried chicken and needs a gfcf diet. I used water and despite the strong oder of cloves, which I was not expecting for a fried chicken batter, he loved it! I tried it too and ate another piece. I suggest that you brown it for a few minutes on each side and then put it in the oven to cook the rest of the way. I am giving it a four because it browns to quickly for larger pieces of meat,I used chicken thighs. The clove spice was acctualy a nice touch, if it was cloves. It doesn't say on the package.

review/text: I have a pantry full of different gluten free flour mixes for various uses. I purchased this mix to use for chicken. Wow!! It was amazing! It crisps up nicely & I love the flavor! We used it on chicken by dipping the chicken in milk, then the coating. After about 10 minutes we repeated the process & placed the chicken in a greased dish & sprinkled melted butter over the coated chicken. Baked until done & it was finger licking good!!

It is still a decent product, but I have found better in Dean and DeLuca (granted that jam was $17). For the price of this product, I probably wouldn't purchase it again, maybe if the price was lowered.
