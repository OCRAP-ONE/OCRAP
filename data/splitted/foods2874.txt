review/summary: problems with morton kosher salt and amazon's listing:
review/text: problem #1:<br />the price.<br />$11.75 is ridiculous when it's $4 in most grocery stores (look for it in the spice aisle, on the bottom shelf)... it's SALT for cryin' out loud.<br />good thing it qualifies for free shipping with a $25 purchase!<br /><br />problem #2:<br />the description is wrong.<br />yes, it's a "pack" "of three pounds" but that's it.<br />the next two items contradict themselves... and the first one is wrong.  it does NOT contain iodine.  kosher salt, by definition, cannot contain iodine.  the anti-caking agent is yellow prussiate of soda.<br />so, the third statement is OBVIOUSLY wrong, because it DOES contain an additive.<br />jeez.<br />"Pack contains of 3 pounds<br />Table salt mixed with iodine to prevent goiter and anti-caking agent<br />Contains no additives"<br /><br />problem #3:<br />it contains an additive.<br />it's NOT pure salt.  so, it's no good for pickling (it can turn the pickles mushy) or making preserved lemons, which i love.<br /><br />i was looking for kosher salt and couldn't remember the name of the one i like so well (and which is hard to find in my area) so i just did a search for "kosher salt".  when this popped up, i was quite surprise to see the price, so i looked at the product and was amazed... and not in a good way.<br /><br />i have used this product and still have a box on the shelf in the pantry.  i won't be buying it again because of the additives.  apparently, morton does not make a salt without additives... even their sea salt has yellow prussiate of soda.  so... sorry, morton.<br /><br />i will buy the diamond crystal kosher salt from now on.  NO additives, just SALT.

review/summary: A great coffee at a great price
review/text: We found the Lavazza Pienaroma to be a high quality, very satisfying coffee. It makes a perfect expresso to enjoy in the morning with your favorite biscotti or an excellent cappucino after a good meal. We also appreciate it in the evening since it won't keep us awake all night as some cheaper makes/blends will do. We only had positive cxomments from our guests.

review/summary: A decent shot; not very fresh though.
review/text: I wasn't very pleased with the Pienaroma. I was getting the Super Crema and thought I'd give a darker roast a try since the Super Crema is very light. I should have stuck with the Super Crema though. I was much fresher when it arrived, and stayed fresh longer. It was very hard for me to pull a shot with the Pienaroma that didn't taste sour. After about three weeks, I could hardly get any pressure, and the taste was practically stale. Stick with the Super Crema and just brew longer shots for your Americanos and lattes if you think it's too light!

review/summary: A superior coffee!
review/text: TASTE/ENJOYMENT<br />This is a beautiful espresso bean, full and creamy with an easy after-taste. As can be expected with 100% arabica beans, there is an earthy taste with notes of cocoa. This is perfect as a desert coffee, and I would highly suggest pairing it with a chocolate cake or pastry for maximum enjoyment. It does not work well as a breakfast coffee if you are looking for a jolt - it has reduced caffeine levels when compared to other espresso beans, but on the positive side it will make a great evening cup!<br /><br />CREMA<br />The crema that results from this blend is one of the best I have seen, sitting around long enough for you to enjoy your espresso without it spoiling. If you don't understand why crema is important, I would strongly suggest doing a little research. If after doing some research you don't think it's important, then I would suggest picking up some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G2F5R4">Folgers</a>.<br /><br />NOTE: To anyone who has never enjoyed European coffee:<br />Espresso beans are not supposed to be burnt, oily and dark in color. This is a by-product of poor espresso roasting, and has become the norm in the U.S. (think Starbucks). Espresso beans in most of Europe are a medium brown, without any oil on the surface (it stays within the bean with superior roasting processes). Espresso is not supposed to be diluted with syrups and flavored creamers, but should be consumed either straight from the machine, or in a macchiato or cappucino. You WILL notice a difference between this and Americanized coffee, and if you are expected something akin to Starbucks extra bold dark (overly) roasted beans, you will be disappointed. Instead, try to allow yourself to experience something different, the way that espresso was meant to be enjoyed.

review/summary: Amaing amounts of flavor!!!!
review/text: This is such a great blend, very impressive!<br /><br />It has a very complex flavor, and is not flat by any means. I do drink it straight, but I will say you would prob like to use this in milk based drinks more than drinking it straight.<br />When in good milk, has a very earthy chocolatey flavor. Sometimes I think I am drinking hot chocolate! It has a very dense flavor on the tongue, and the first time you drink it you will want to savor every sip to just appreciate the complexity of the blends flavor.<br /><br />I am biased and prefer dark oily roasts. But I always keep a big bag of this in the freezer and have it every day or 2 when making a cappuccino. It also supposedly has less caffeine than the other Lavazza blends, and I can attest to that. Dark roasts sometimes miss the department in complexity with flavor, but sometimes you want a nice strong kick in the morning or in a straight shot. But for all the other times? Get this, very very impressive.

review/text: This coffee is real espresso.  It grinds well in my Baratza grinder and makes great espresso with my Gaggia espresso maker. The bean are NOT oily (good) and do not gum up the grinder.  The crema is the best that I have gotten from most other coffee beans.  I like this better when it was about $4 cheaper, but with government produced inflation I do not much choice.

review/summary: End of Another Great Brand
review/text: This used to be the real great one in Northern Italian style espresso - half the price of Illy Normale, and more consistent.  But that's apparently all over now.  I have just had exactly the same experience as D. Cocco reports above.  The coffee was stale, and completely changed - way overbalanced toward one, particularly strong flavor.  I sent a respectful email to them about this, and received no reply.  It wasn't necessary to pay the premium price for imported Italian coffee anyway; it's just that this one was a particular favorite, so I'd spring for it once in a while.  But there are better choices, and for a lot less.  Dean's Beans, for instance.

review/summary: An excellent bean
review/text: I have been using Lavazza beans for years, first at my cafe in VT and now as a regular coffee drinker at home.<br />Previously I bought the Super Crema beans. But I prefer all Arabica so I have switched to Pienaroma.<br />I find these beans make a smoother espresso with a sweeter finish. The crema is rich and thick.<br />You can drink this brew as an espresso or with milk. It makes a better espresso than blends with robusta beans.<br />My only criticism is that the beans are not as fresh as I would like. I have had them when it was clear they were<br />freshly roasted as soon as I opened the bag. The aroma was intoxicating. However, the convenience of getting<br />these beans sent directly at a good price makes up for the lack of freshness.<br />However, I have to add that I have been a coffee "fanatic" all my life and now at this late age of 69 I have<br />relaxed my standards just a little bit. It's a lot of work to have the perfect beans and the perfect espresso.<br />This makes an espresso that is very, very good and if the beans aren't the freshest, then that's ok with me.

review/summary: IKEA beans are better than this
review/text: I got some IKEA's dark roast beans while waiting for my Lavazza Pienaroma. Finally the shipment arrived. When I opened the package the small was very good. It was very intense, creamy with a hit of little chocolate. So I pulled my 1st shot of espresso and tried it and fell off my chair.<br />The taste was light, unfocused, and without any finish. I felt like I was drinking diluted coffee. The almost bland liquid basically just disappear in the mouth and that's it. Is it because of this "air roasted" feature? Who knows. I do know comparing to the IKEA I say I over paid for the Lavazza. Will have to try brewing them as regular coffee and see. Bottom line: very disappointed.

review/summary: good except doesn't fit well in my Senseo pod brewer
review/text: These "universal" pods are a little too thick to fit in the single-pod tray (and a little too thin and too small in diameter to work in the double-pod tray) in in our Senseo machine (the less-expensive or older Senseo model).  One time my wife forced it closed and I had to re-seat the "hinge" of the machine after it popped apart. So now we bang on each pod (still in its individual wrapper) a couple of times with a nearby steel flour canister on the counter to compress it enough to put it in and be able to close the Senseo without forcing it.<br /><br />Other than that, they're a good value and my wife likes the way they taste (she's the coffee drinker), and presumably they may work better with some other machines, so I'll give them three stars.<br /><br />The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EEFOE">Baronet Coffee Donut Shop Blend Light Roast (140 g), 18-Count Coffee Pods (Pack of 3)</a> is almost as inexpensive per pod and fits our Senseo better, although it doesn't have the vanilla flavor and the pods aren't individually-wrapped.<br /><br />In either case, use the subscribe-and-save to save 15% and get free separate regular shipping (not super-saver shipping).  You can subscribe as one order per six months, and then you can always cancel the subscription as soon as the first shipment is sent.

review/summary: Can't wait till I can get the Senseo products
review/text: I have been buying these since there has been problem with the original supplier of Senseo pods.  These vanilla ones are the worst.  Very weak and not worth bothering with.  The creme brulee and hazelnut are just okay, and will suffice till Senseo gets back in the business.  However, the issue about them only fitting in the double pod container is a very real one.  First of all, anyone wanting a double cup of coffee has to wait twice as long.  But more than that---they need to be smoothed out in the holder, or the water will work its way around the pod, and the coffee will be undrinkable.  Also, at least 2 of the pods in each container are split and unusable.

review/text: Senseo seems to have stopped making the absolute best French Vanilla pods, so I ordered these. First and foremost they don't smell or taste of French Vanilla. Second they are much milder than the senseo pods,& they don't hve a robust coffee taste either. One plus about Melitta pods is that they are individually packaged & will probably stay fresher. Another plus is that Melitta still produces pods for my senseo coffee maker. It seems all coffee producers are moving to the Kurig plastic cup(yuck) coffee brewing system.

review/summary: Delicious Gummies That Won't Make You Croak...
review/text: Gummy candies such as Gummy bears, frogs, cherries and worms are my second favorite sweet candy next to Jelly Beans; so stumbling across my favorite of the gummy candies on Amazon was a real treat.  What we have here are Mini-Rainbow Frogs, 5oz packages in a pack of 12.<br /><br />TASTE<br />There are 4 colors/flavors to the frogs, Red / Green / Yellow / Orange  which convert to the flavors of  Strawberry, Raspberry, Lemon and Orange.  The underbellies of the frogs are white and have an almost marshmallow/coconut taste to them.  It is hard to really place it but surprisingly the white underbelly flavor blends together exceptionally well with the fruit flavor making for a delicious gummy treat.  The mini-frogs are fairly sweet so I tend to pick at them one at a time and let then slowly soften as I chew on the candy.  Makes them last much longer and brings out the flavor<br /><br />SHIPPING<br />The product arrived in a standard box with the packages inside them.  Like most candy, shipping during the summer months can be risky especially with chocolate or gelatin based candy.  On 2-3 day shipping the product arrived in great condition, warm but still soft and fresh.  If left on a truck too long however gelatin candy like this can end up melting and turning into a big clump.  As a receiver/manager in the food industry I've seen this happen plenty of times; so just be a little careful during the summer months.  Other than that these ship great during the other seasons.<br /><br />OVERALL these are a delicious gummy treat.  If you are a fan of Haribo Gummy Bears then do not be afraid to try the mini-frogs.  The added flavor of the white underbellies makes for a unique flavor in the end, that might just convert your love for Gummy Bears into a love for mini-frogs (just like it did to me).  This is a excellent quality product with a delicious taste, and very satisfying as a sweet snack.  5 stars!

review/summary: Haribo...what more needs to be said???
review/text: I love these little gummie and marshmellow frogs...I keep them in the car for a quick snack while I am driving. I didn't think I could possibly like anything better than the "bears" but this is now at the top of my favorite Haribo candies.  Be careful...they can be addictive.

review/summary: These are TOO yummy!!!!
review/text: I am adult, supposedly in my right mind, just turned 59 years old, and I am a closet lover of these little gummi frogs. Well, not totally. My work colleagues see them hidden in the back corner of my desk (I try to hide them), and they laugh their heads off that I'm eating these things. I regularly go to the ethnic market next door and buy every bag they have left. Then I have to go gummi-less until the next shipment comes in - aaaarrrrghh! Plus the checkout girls look at me funny when I buy these armloads of little froggies. Well, I decided to see if there was somewhere where I could buy them in bulk and in secret - and AMAZON came through again. Will wonders never cease. I can't believe it - I can buy them a dozen at a time through Amazon and no one will be the wiser .. except the trash guy. I even smuggle the bags out of work when I'm done scarfing these things down because people see the empty bags in my trash and they laugh some more. Thank you, Amazon, for fulfilling my dreams once again. You're the best!

review/summary: Fun, pleasant snack
review/text: Love Haribo products. Have tried a few of them. This one is very good. Since they're smaller there is a tendency to find yourself consuming the whole bag. The frogs are half fruit gummy and have marshmallow like. Because of this the taste is not as pronounced as say ... the Classic Gold Bears. Either way they're very good. I can't seem to find them in any stores nearby so I'm happy Amazon sells it. Love it, girlfriend can't seem to get enough of 'em.

review/text: Wow I bought a box of 12 packages based on the other positive reviews but I am so sorry. These are basically tasteless. They're very very gummy/chewy, barely resemble frogs and are just generically sweet. I'm going to find people to give the remaining 11 bags away to. So sorry I bought these. If you are expecting anything like regular gummy candies, these are not them!

review/summary: best off-the-shelf salsa ever
review/text: Original Review, January 2008:  This was a great deal on absolutely the best off-the-shelf salsa ever!  I've bought this for years from a local grocery store, but lately they're often out of stock, so I went looking online and found this great deal on Amazon.  Came back to order more now, but Amazon says it's "currently unavailable".  hope that changes soon.<br /><br />NOTE:  Herdez also offers the same product in a jar, but somehow the canned version tastes significantly better.  Not sure why.<br /><br />UPDATE, November 2010:  Price changed a while back, and now this is a terrible deal!  Used to be &lt;$1/can with free shipping.  Now it's about $2/can.  Grocery stores carry this for &lt;$1/can, but unfortunately my local store seems to stop stocking it periodically.  Would sure be convenient to order online again, but for now I'm just gonna have to keep special-ordering it from the local grocery.

review/summary: The best salsa at a great price
review/text: We used to pay $4-$5 for Casa Sanchez salsa, made fresh and sold in local grocery stores in the area.  Then I discovered Herdez salsas in a can for a fraction of the cost.  This stuff is great.  It is nice and spicy, and surprisingly fresh tasting.  I add extra fresh sliced jalepenos sometimes for myself but rest of family likes the casera version.  We add on top of all our mexican cooking.  I no longer bother spending a fortune on Casa Sanchez salsas.  I don't buy many things in a can, just sliced olives, Herdez salsas, and sliced pinapples pretty much are the only canned goods in my pantry as I am a foodie that makes most things from scratch.  This is way beyond the league of Pace Picante sauces.  This is the real stuff.  One Safeway store near me carries, while another doesn't ever seem to have in stock but I'll talk to management to make sure they carry this item as it's great.  If not, then great that we can order Herdez salsas on Amazon.

review/text: I didn't see a "heat index" or any indication of hotness when I bought this, but when I received it, it was listed HOT. I don't think is is that hot, but i would prefer a medium version. That being said, this salsa is very flavorful and tastes great. The small cans are nice because the salsa stays fresh if you only use a small amount each serving.

review/text: Ounce for ounce, Herdez Salsa Casera in the 7 oz can was the best canned (or jarred) salsa 'around'!! I even ordered it, by the case, from Mex-Grocer on-line! Recently I bought a can from Publix in Florida & the can had a new label. The salsa has been changed!!!Still pretty good, but not the same. Not sure what has changed, but not as good as the old version which I rated 5 stars!!

review/summary: Great pantry staple
review/text: Salsa makes a great pantry staple and this Herdez Salsa is very good -- not too spicy but not too bland.  As another reviewer says, the canned salsa is better than the bottled for some reason -- it tastes fresher to me.  Salsa can be used to add flavor to rice and to tomato sauces, in addition to being a dip for chips and an addition to chili.  This is a good price for this item.

review/summary: good for diabetic dogs
review/text: I have a diabetic dog who loves dog biscuits.  We thought we might have to give them up because of the diabetes.  But the vet told us about this hi fiber biscuit and we tried it and she loves it!  Purchasing them thru the vet was twice as expensive as getting them by mail and buying in bulk, although they have gone up a dollar a bag since I have been getting them by mail.  I hope they will continue to be available and affordable so my fur baby can enjoy her treats.

review/summary: Excellent for Anal Glands Problems
review/text: My dog suffers from her anal glands not working properly. She would always have to have them expressed frequently, and always scooting/ rolling on the floor, and also obsessed with licking her butt area. All the tests would say nothing is wrong with her.  I took her to the vet again and was told about this biscuit, tried some immediately. Within a couple days I noticed a HUGE difference. She's calm and relaxed, and isn't so interested about licking her butt anymore. This definitely helped her BIG time. I absolutely recommend this to you, if your dog has issues down there. TRY these, don't let your dog suffer anymore. Some dogs may not like these, since they're bland, but crunchy, and my dog will eat anything crunchy :)

Anyways straight to point:<br />The bottle is pretty small as you can see so putting 9oz water or more will probably lead to minor leakage, in my case it did.<br />Anything under 9oz is generally perfect, mixes great with the wire wisk ball.<br />I don't find any huge lumps left over in the bottle after I drink it, and there is no horrible odor after use, especially if you clean it regularly. I would only wish this bottle to be a bit larger so I wouldn't have any problems with leakage after rigorous shaking.<br />All in all, I would buy another one of these if I had to, they are cheap and compact.

review/summary: Excellent salmon jerky
review/text: This salmon jerky has the right texture, the right moisture, the right chewiness.  It's not too salty, and although there could have been a tad bit more smoke taste to it, this is the best salmon jerky I have tasted.<br /><br />My only gripe with it is the price.  I would eat 3-4 packs of this every night if I could afford it, but I can't and I find it very hard to stop eating it for budget reasons.  :o(<br /><br />I guess I could buy one pack at a time, but that would leave me in serious cravings for more so I have actually stopped buying it.  If you have the dough, go for it !

review/summary: Shocked and Amazed
review/text: Had almost given up finding something to reduce the hairballs (on beige carpet) from our Maine Coon, which were everyday occurrences. In desperation I went online to search for solutions and found this food. Since it was kind of expensive, I just threw a handfull of it into the "constant feed" bowl every day. (The cats would come running.) I didn't really expect it to make a difference, but I am too poor to just let them chow down on $14-per-bag food.  Within a week, though, the hairballs were on the decline, and now a month later, they have virtually been eliminated. I am totally shocked! Although I could justify the expense of this food based solely on its performance, it makes it a little easier when you consider I no longer have to buy carpet cleaner in bulk...

review/text: I have 2 ragdoll kitties and I thought one of them has a sensitive tummy.<br />They have had only grain free food because I didn't want them to eat<br />unnecessary calories. Besides, corn is really unhealthy for cats & dogs.<br />Lately the vomiting was getting worse and also she started to hack. I<br />guessed it was hairball related because they have medium coat fur. It is<br />recommended to give cats hairball remedy food but NOT on the long term.<br />I researched many brands and I bought this one to try. They get half<br />portion of this brand and half portion of Natural Balance Green Pea with<br />Duck. The Natural Balance Green Pea is for sensitive tummies. It has been<br />2 months and no more problems at all. Their coats look great and they have<br />lots of energy. They like the Royal Canin so I'll keep them on it for a<br />while longer.

review/summary: Surprised at how tasty this must be to Vita the cat
review/text: I was looking for a 2-pound bag of Wellness dry cat food when I discovered this Royal Canin variety. My cat Vita, an eight year old female Maine Coon mix, is very picky about wanting fresh food in her bowl, so I don't like to buy huge bags of dry food. Although I found the Wellness dry food (blue bag) in five-plus pound sizes, I started reading the entertaining and informative reviews of other food. I've tried Royal Canin in the past and had pretty good results with Vita liking it and not just scarfing it down, only to regurgitate half of her meal. Vita the cat throws up long stringy hair balls from hell. She typically does this in warm weather of course. In my ignorance, I never thought to look for cat food that might help her digest (and pass?) all the hair she ingests from her rigorous grooming. Sometimes I really wince when I see her licking that long fur, over and over. Good grief, I think to myself, your insides must look like a shag rug. I just mopped up her routine hair packages left on the tile, hardwood, and carpet... how could I be so insensitive as not to look for a digestive aid?<br /><br />Well, to get to the point: I ordered Royal Canin Dry Cat Food, Intense Hairball 34 Formula, 3-Pound Bag from Amazon a few weeks ago. Hence, I am now commenting on the results. Ok... more to the point: I am amazed at how much Vita loves this food. She immediately ate it all and did not leave her usual 1/3 of saliva-drooled-upon food behind. Her habit is to leave food in the bowl because it is not "fresh" enough after she's had her way with it, and I end up eventually throwing out good money. Because I worry that giving her this formula 100% every day might cause her to become dehydrated (or because of some other junk science idea that pops into my head), I decided to mix it 50/50 with her Wellness dry food. I went ahead and bought a small bag of Wellness from my local pet store. I do after all love to support local businesses when feasible.<br /><br />Regarding hairballs: So far she has not thrown up any at all, and we've been having a heat wave. Her innards seem to be working very well and she's even gained a little weight, which for her is good. Vita is a 50/50 indoor/outdoor cat. I let her out during the day or she would drive us all crazy. So even though this food specifies that it is for INDOOR, I ignored that. I am glad that we now seem to have a solution for hairballs and digestion. Just make sure your cat drinks plenty of water (more of my theorizing).

review/text: You won't find this on the shelf, but MD.s and Parents should know it is out there!  I am not a medical professional.<br /><br />  I have 5 children who had sever allergies to all the normal formulas, milk or soy based, as well as Alimentum, Nutramigen, and Pregestimil. I found it absolutely ridiculous that none of our Pediatricians had any knoledge of the formulas out there, and that I had to educate them... But if I had not been proactive, my children would of suffered more then they did... or possibly failed to thrive... live?<br /><br />  With all 5 children, I tried the normal formulas first, then proceeded to the hypoallergenic... I thank God I found Neocate, WOW... It was a life saver, for my kids!!! No more vomiting, diaper rashes/yeast infections/thrush, cramps, bloating, gas, screaming in pain... it was wonderfull not having infants/toddlers who screamed in pain 20 + hours a day!!! My children thrived on Neocate, where they had done poorly on the other formulas.<br /><br />  However my children did not tolerate the DHA ARA additives, thankfully back 5 years ago, Neocate could be bought without it. The manufacture of this formula (Nutricia - Advanced medical nutrition) has a large line of products to meet special nutritional and medical needs of infants/children/adults. It had to be obtained by prescription, and medically necessary to get insurance to pay for it...

review/text: One issue of drinking home brewed spiced tea is many of the products out there do not work well with simmering finer spices.  These bags once tied tight do the job better than anything else I've tried.  I've also used the bags to stuff herbs and spices in poultry for the rotisserie and I have use them in pots of soup/sauces (where I want the flavor but not the herb texture).  They worked wonderfully and held up well for all of these purposes.  I am sure they work equally well for scent sachets or a number of other purposes.  The strings on my bags pull shut very easy and the product is well made and holds up.  For many purposes the bags could be washed and reused.

Yes, the pieces are moist but in a preserved radish way with smallish, flattened pieces. It just doesn't have the premium beef jerky heft where you can separate the pieces along the grain. Don't expect premium beef taste and texture but rather a product processed more in the Chinese restaurant baking soda, tenderized fashion.  I truly regret my purchase which I probably couldn't give away.

After the 2nd piece, the meat began to leave a bad chemical aftertaste.  I understand everyone's taste buds will be different so do yourself a favor and buy a small bag of this at Walmart before getting the big bags here.

review/summary: Horrible at WSOP
review/text: So I have been hanging with a top player at the world series of poker and I purchased 2 packages of Jacks Links beef jerky.  These 2 purchases were the worst possible way to spend my money.  The meat was so dry I was not sure if I was eating dried rat tail or beef jerkey.  The "meat" caused sickness and lock jaw.  Jacks links is as good as scraps off leather shoes.  It was pretty incredible of them to sponser the WSOP but provide poor quality food at a ridiculous price.

review/summary: Not a good value, but tasty
review/text: The packs are really small. I thought I was saving by buying in bulk, but it was not a lot for the money.  As usually the beef jerkey tastes great.

review/summary: jerky is yummy
review/text: I can't always get to the store on my bicycle, so it is quite handy to use Amazon & order something I hanker for.  The beef jerky, high in protein & low in calories, fat & carbs, absolutely hit the spot when it arrived nice & quickly!
