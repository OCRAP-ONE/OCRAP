review/summary: Convenient, well made, easy to clean
review/text: Like many other reviewers, I first saw one of these on Alton Brown's show and wanted one.<br />Having a salt cellar like this is so much more convenient that using the box or bag the salt comes in.<br />This is the nicest one I have been able to find.<br /><br />To summarise the good points others have made:<br />- well made with a silicon gasket to keep contents dry<br />- attached hinged lid flips open easily<br />- easy to clean<br />- stylish enough to leave on the counter or use on the table<br />- good size: holds large quantity and easy to get your hand into the bowl for a pinch of salt<br /><br />Some people have complained about the hinged handle not being curved and being difficult to use with one hand (while grabbing salt with the other hand). I don't have this problem - I find it easy to lift and open the bowl with one hand while seasoning with the other. Perhaps if you have small hands or don't have a strong wrist it might be harder, as it can be a bit heavy when full.<br /><br />As for the spoon, yes it is too small to use for seasoning a pot of food when you are cooking, but that's not its purpose. A "serving" spoon like this is meant to be used to season individual servings of food, on your plate, at the table. I'd much rather use a measuring spoon or my hand anyway - and I would rather have a bowl like this with a tight seal to keep out moisture and dust than one with a slot in the lid to accommodate a tiny spoon.

review/summary: A touch of professionalism
review/text: Okay, I'll get it out of the way first: Yes, I am a huge fan of Alton Brown, and that's mostly why I bought this.  But still, it's a first rate product for a food lover to have, and it all comes down to access.  The primary seasoning for any food is salt, always has been, always will be, and having it so close and easy to access is good for cooking, especially quick methods like stir-frying where seconds count.<br />It's also airtight, so your salt won't go stale (though you could just give the tiny spoon a miss entirely), and the glass is easy to clean and thick enough that I don't worry about it breaking if I bump it about.<br />If I had a complaint, it's that this gets dirty very quickly, but then on the other hand, it's stainless, so it cleans up twice as quickly.

review/summary: Elegant
review/text: Purchased this salt server as a stove-side addition to the olive oil, pepper, etc. that get a lot of use when we're cooking. It's beautiful! The finish of the metal base and hinged lid are blemish-free and very shiny, and the glass container removes for easy washing. A silicone bushing in the underside of the lid mates nicely with the glass rim, keeping moisture out of your expensive sea salt! The small spoon is very handy for sprinkling, although when cooking I'm generally just grabbing a pinch or two with my fingers. Don't worry, I washed my hands ;) The server would also fit in with the most elegant table setting you could come up with. It's very pretty as well as functional.

review/text: This is an excellent product, and all the Alton Brown whiners need to not worry about the handle so much. You do not have to hold your salt server just to get a pinch of salt, and even so this can one be held/opened with one hand. Besides it is only necessary if you are filming a cooking show...<br />BTW, AB is my man idol (if this is possible!)

review/summary: Awesome salt cellar
review/text: I'm not sure if this is exactly the same as the salt cellar that Alton Brown uses, but if it's not, it's a clone. The silicone gasket keeps moisture out and I have not had a problem yet with my kosher salt clumping. It is also easy to clean not to mention very attractive. I would recommend this salt cellar to anyone. The included spoon is convenient and matches the cellar nicely. It is not too big and not too small. It holds enough salt to keep me going for weeks of cooking and seasoning. My counter space is at a premium and it has earned a permanent place on it.

review/summary: Nice addition to the kitchen.
review/text: I recently switched to a cellar instead of a shaker because I mainly use salt as an ingredient or for seasoning meat, and rarely as a condiment.  It has a nice little spoon for IF you want to sprinkle some on your eggs or potatoes, but I'm tempted to throw it out since I'm a big fan of pinching over shaking.

review/summary: Just like Good Eats
review/text: This is just like one of the ones from the later seasons of Alton Brown's Good Eats, and that's exactly why I had to find one to bring home last time I was in America.<br /><br />The only thing I would change is to make the handle a little bigger, add a bit of a downward part to the handle to give something more to use, a bit like a trigger... it's a little hard to hold onto the short handle and open it with the same hand.<br /><br />This is much better than the other alternative salt cellar that I could find. This one doesn't have a cut-out for a spoon, since the spoon fits inside, and instead has a silicon seal around the lid to keep any contaminates out.

review/summary: Perfect addition to the kitchen
review/text: I saw Alton Brown using this on "Good Eats" and even though it's fairly expensive, I decided to give it a try. Since I've been using kosher salt more and cooking more frequently, this salt cellar is probably one of the most-used items in my kitchen.  I keep it on the counter next to the stove, so I don't have to reach into the cupboard when I need it. For dinners I can just bring it out and it looks great on the table.  It is well-constructed and looks built to last.  The glass dish slides right out for easy cleaning.  The spoon it comes with is kind of a waste, since I just pinch it out with my fingers, and since there's no real place to store it (the lid won't close fully with the spoon in it, although that probably doesn't matter).  Another great advantage of a salt cellar like this over a salt shaker, is that it allows you to visually see how much salt you're putting on your food so you don't overdue it. Given how many people are consuming too much sodium, this is a great way to cut back.

review/text: I also bought this because of Alton Brown ;) I like that you can pinch the salt fairly quickly because the spoon is so tiny I never know what measurement it is, I end up oversalting or undersalting when I use it. I also quickly learned that pinching salt has a few annoyances (for me personally because I'm a mess in the kitchen): if your hands are moist, you end up with salty fingers; I hate salt in my fingernails!; never knowing how much a pinch should be; opening the container with hands full of food is not easy! Otherwise, the container looks pretty cool.

I absolutely love it and use it every time I cook, but a word of caution: on several occasions, unsuspecting guests who are not fans of Alton Brown have confused the Salt Vault with a sugar bowl and salted their coffee/tea. If you're going to keep yours out in the open, make sure to either label it or warn people that it isn't sugar!

review/text: I just received this salt server and the wife immediately shot it down as "looks cheap". A very noticeable difference in mine is that the clear rubber flange that rings the inside of the top has half a dozen small rubber anchors that push through holes on the top of the metal lid. While I'm sure this helps keep the rubber flange from falling out, the rubber nubs that are visable on the top and are NOT pictured on the online image look stupid. I am dissappointed because I am an Alton Brown lover and wanted to have the real McCoy. I'm returning it and will purchas an Olivewood salt cellar instead.

review/text: We are big fans of Alton Brown's Good Eats on the Food Network.  We were looking for a salt server just like the one he uses.  While this one may not be the same one Alton purchased, it definitely does the job.  What separates this server from others that we looked at is the rubber gasket that seals the lid to the bowl.  This is an essential component to keep the salt dry and prevent little critters from creeping into the salt (even more so if you plan to use it for sugar).  The little spoon that comes with it is cute and all, but we do not use it.  If you were going to use the server on a buffet or as a sugar bowl, the spoon would be handy to have.  We highly recommend this product.

review/summary: bogus handle
review/text: Like others, I bought this so I could be like Alton Brown, pinching out kosher salt as needed.  First, the good.  The item seems heavy-duty enough.  The glass bowl comes out for easy cleaning and the frame seems solid enough.  Now the bad.  I expected some kind of vertical piece to the handle so I could hold it like a coffee-cup style.  But no.  The handle (such as it is) is just a horizontal piece extending an inch or two out from the rim.  (I think you're meant to hold the bowl in your hand and let this bit rest your thumb on the top of this bit--not sure.)  Definitely not what was expected.  Also, the spoon is micro-sized.  I mean you could hardly snort drugs off this thing.  Totally useless.<br /><br />Still, I give the item a B-.  It's solid and I don't feel like I need to go get a replacement.  I just wish I'd known about that handle beforehand.  I might have chosen an item with a better one, even if it's called a "cheese server" or what have you.

I stopped by two different department stores trying to find it, as well as a couple of super markets...Alton Brown uses something very similar. Its easy to pop open with the thumb while you hold the item in your hand. Then with the free hand you can scoop out what you need in a measuring spoon, making life much easier then opening a salt box, then dumping too much into you spoon! This will be in my kitchen for the rest of my life, and used often. It works amazingly well, and looks great!

review/summary: RSVP Salt Server
review/text: Boy, I never even knew they had something like this. I normally kept my salt in a dish with a lid. Well one day I was watching YouTube episodes of, you guessed it, Good Eats, and saw this amazing salt server on the show. I decided that the one handed open mechanism was better that pulling off the lid every time I needed to salt something. It's stainless steel stand and glass dish look nice, but the best thing is the seal around the lid. The tiny spoon is adorable, but I probably won't use it much. The price was a lot cheaper at Amazon than anywhere else I looked. Most places were selling it for 25 or 30 dollars. All in all, good deal and good product.

review/text: Product is fine except that I wish it had a looped handle you could put<br />a finger through so you could pick it up more easily to use. You cannot<br />pick it up and open flipper lid with one hand as easily (actually, at all)<br />with this little tab handle. I also think the wee little spoon is next to<br />useless...just using your finger for a pinch is more effective. I have seen<br />salt cellars with deeper bowled spoons that were more useful. This one just<br />seems like a toy. But otherwise the overall construction is sturdy and well<br />made.

review/summary: like Alton Brown's salt cellar
review/text: We use this in the kitchen, just like Alton Brown (this one isn't endorsed by him, but we couldn't find one that is).  It's a great way to get to our salt for adding to recipes, rather than trying to dump it out of those little spouts on the boxes.  I can hold and open it with one hand and reach in with the other for anything from a pinch to a spoonful.  The dish comes out of the base for easy cleaning as well.  And the little spoon allows for easy use serving at dinner as well.  So it's multi-functional.

review/summary: Just what I wanted
review/text: There's a lot of salt holders available these days. While most are simply variations of a bowl to spoon from, this one with a protective lid is really a step above most. The metal exterior is sturdy and wipes clean with a cloth easily enough. The lid raises with a simple thumb lever almost reflexively and the glass bowl can be effortlessly removed and put back. I actually remove the glass bowl portion when I am doing a lot of seasoning, rather than move the whole frame. I have washed the glass bowl in the dishwasher several times without trouble.<br /><br />The whole metal frame and salt bowl is pretty big. If you are in a tiny kitchen or don't use kosher-type salt often then this may be more than you are looking for. All in all, a classy looking and very functional little addition to the kitchen.

review/summary: Very good for small sauces too
review/text: Alton Brown or not, I like this salt server. I have been looking for a small container for my chili oil, complete with a spoon that fits in it, so I won't have to pull out extra spoons especially when I have already used that same spoon for mixing stuff and then realizing I want to add more chili oil. It was a long search, and some of the containers/jars are just too big when all I needed was something that could handle approximately a cup of whatever. This was what I was looking for.<br /><br />The stainless steel casing was very elegant, and goes well with our predominantly white kitchen. It comes with a tiny spoon (perfect for pinches) that fits in the container without having a "slot" on the lid for which serving spoons usually protrude out of, which makes it ideal for my sauce, since I'd like to keep pests and most air out.<br /><br />Of course this thing is not for pouring, at least as a whole, as the glass bowl is fitted loosely around the frame. If you need to pour its contents, remove the bowl from the steel frame first. And the lid doesn't "seal" the container, merely covering it up and protecting its contents with the silicone gasket.<br /><br />Overall, it's not only for salt, it's also for sauces too! I am happy with my purchase.<br /><br />See my customer image for an accurate measurement of the product.

review/text: My hubby has wanted one of these since seeing AB use one on every episode!  I searched high and low, at every high end kitchen shop, boutique and bargain store.  I had no idea where AB got this, and spent 5 long years trying to find one.. then, I ordered something on Amazon, and wallah.. it suggested this salt server.. it is perfect!  Solid metal base is sturdy and substantial.  The glass bowl is heavy too.  The lid is hinged and easy to open with one hand.  It also seals nicely on the bowl when closed.  Its perfect.  We don't use the spoon.

review/text: I started finding it a pain to pull the box of kosher salt out of the cupboard, so I decided to buy this, thanks to seeing Alton Brown use it on "Good Eats". The look of this item works with our kitchen, as we have granite counter tops and stainless steel appliances. The lid has a gasket which keeps moisture out of the vessel itself. The glass bowl sits perfectly in the metal holder, and can be removed for washing.<br /><br />And excellent buy, for me!

review/text: It's what Alton Brown uses on Good Eats.  I got an official Sodium Chloride Containment Unit from his website (it was cheaper and I'd rather he made money off of it.  And it WAS cheaper).  That said, it works well to contain your sodium chloride.  If you don't use it often or leave it open, the salt will absorb dampness. His doesn't come with a spoon, but then, who uses a spoon?

review/summary: No happy with this salt server
review/text: I put this on my wish list and luckily someone purchased it for me. I don't want to sound ungrateful at all but this is not at all what I had expected it to be. It is NOT the same as the one Alton Brown uses on his show. Which is hard to see that from the photos (when I first looked at the item there was only 1 photo), now there are additional photos of the item which shows that is has basically no handle to hold the salt cellar. The seal on mine keeps the lid from closing and it looks like it is ajar and will allow moisture in. When I tried opening and closing, when holding by the "handle", the lid of the cellar I about dropped out of my hand. I don't know about anyone else but I'd prefer not to spill a bunch of salt and have broken glass in my kitchen, because of a poorly designed item. I hate to return gifts but I think this has to go back.

review/summary: Love it! A Top Ten Must Have for Anyone's Kitchen!
review/text: Yes you see this on that Good Eats cooking show all the time. It's an amazing product and so easy to have salt at reach.  the spoon is a bit much to me, so toss it away. Product is a must have in the kitchen.<br /><br />Only flaw<br /><br />The glass portion is heavy duty and pops right out of the holder for easy cleaning.  Unfortunatley, the glass part dose not lock into place so you are a touch limited to moving around with it in the holder so I gave it 4 out of 5 stars.  Let just say it would fall out if you desided to take it out for a jog around the park.  But, trully if it is just moving it from one counter to another your in luck.  It dose the job perfectly.<br /><br />Hold plenty of salt too.  I would have to guess a little over a cup of kosher salt.<br /><br />The salt dose not clump up too much either, but it is not perfection.  It has been used all summer right next to the stove and has very little clumping which is a great feature for all of us!<br /><br />I highly recommend.  Some day I may just buy about 20 of these and store all my spices in them.  Thats how much I like them!  This is a must have for anyone who boils water!<br /><br />this is the best in the market as of 2011

review/text: I not only think Alton Brown's "Good Eats" is the best cooking show on T.V., but I'm also a total sucker for cute gadgets and this one fit the bill! After seeing Alton use one many times, I had to have one. I purchased mine at Linens 'n Things and absolutely love it. It's not only adorable, but indespensibly functional. We use unprocessed salt called "Real Salt" and it keeps the salt clean and prevents it from forming lumps. I also use Kosher salt for tasks such as boiling pasta. I'm so enthused about this wonderful salt server that all of my family and my husband's sister are getting one for Christmas. Since Linens 'n Things is going out of business, I was delighted to find them on Amazon.

review/summary: Salt Servers
review/text: Salt Servers<br /><br />If like me, perhaps you have seen the salt servers shown on Alton Brown's programs or listed in his book "Gear for Your Kitchen".  We found two items on Amazon.  Viewer reviews suggested that both seemed to be the salt server used by Alton Brown.  Well I bought one; and then bought another that we found on Amazon.  Once received some issues existed with the first item purchased.  Better details apply to the second item.  Neither item includes any logo similar to the Amazon description.<br /><br />I plan to use both items, perhaps one for sea salt and the other for Kosher salt.  My spouse will decide the uses but first let me describe some differences.<br />First I bought a a salt server listed in Amazon as "Salt Server / Cheese Bowl / Condiment Serving Bowl & Spoon Set - Fine Stainless Steel Serveware for Your Home" for $20.00.  Some aspects of this product an opening in the top for a spoon and a spoon like a desert spoon that extends through the top lid with no seal around the spoon or the lid.  This item was received around 24 March, 2011.  My spouse applied plastic wrap to keep some of the moisture out of the salt.  This item may remain a salt server; or my spouse may find a better use.<br /><br />The Amazon description reflects functions for "serving gourmet sea salt and kosher salt by your counter-top".  The description also mentions "serving Parmesan cheese for your Pasta, sugar for your tea, cranberry sauce for your turkey, chocolate sprinkles for your ice cream, Jalapeno peppers and salsa for your Mexican dishes, and condiments on your dining and buffet table."  This sounds better than using it for salt.<br /><br />Then I bought the "RSVP Endurance Salt Server with Spoon" from Amazon for $18.95.  The purchase dates are the key for differentiating the two items.  This item was received 12 April 2011.  No hole exists in the lid for the spoon.  The spoon is much smaller and fits inside the container.  The lid has a gasket.  In my humble opinion, the RSVP model would be the only item to buy as a salt server although each could be used for other applications.  I give the RSVP item high marks, and less for the other.

Furthermore,my dog has never been injured by the chipping.  My experience with these sterilized bones has been good!

review/text: I was very pleasantly surprised when I first tasted one of these cookies!  They were soft and tasty--much like my home-baked peanut butter cookies--only better since I tend to over-bake mine!<br /><br />I have many allergies so it's difficult for me to find pre-made cookies I can safely eat.  Barley and corn starch, which I am very allergic to, find their way masked in many ingredients for pre-made food products.  I was very glad to find the ingredients in these cookies are safe for me:  Peanut Butter;  Molasses; Eggs; Rice Syrup and Grape Juice; Flour Base (Brown Rice Flour, White Rice Flour, Tapioca Starch, Sweet Rice Flour, Xanthum Gum); Dry Roasted Peanut Pieces; Gluten-free Natural Flavor, Baking Soda; Sea Salt. This means they are gluten-free as well.<br /><br />With only 11g of carbohydrates, 7 g of sugar, and 3 g of protein, I can indulge with 2 for a mid-day snack without the guilt!<br /><br />If you are too busy to make home-baked cookies yourself, these are certainly a viable alternative...and they're quite healthy, too!  Highly recommended!

I had to break them with a sharp knife point in a small dish, but that makes them a good dunking cookie, if you like that style of cookie eating.

review/text: Of all of the Pamela's prepared products that I've tried, these are among my least favorite.  The cookie texture crumbled in my hands, and the balance between the sweetness or the cookie and the tartness of the coffee was lacking.  In the end it was mostly bitter without much body.  Definitely not one of the better treats in this line.

review/text: My poor fur baby  went through so much suffering until I found this Instinct brand grain free food.  I tried a few others but she absolutely loves the turkey duck flavor.  She used to scratch herself raw and bloody could not sleep and was on steroids but she now has no itching at all. she never gets itchy unless she gets into some grain, human food or other dog food.  This has been a great find.  I highly recommend it if your dog does not like it try a different flavor.

review/text: In contrast to the other reviewers, whose dogs had trouble with this food, my dog positively inhales it. Being grain-free it must have a more meaty flavor that she likes. I've been following the Nature's Variety rotation feeding with some of their other types, and have noticed since switching to this food her coat is glossier and she doesn't have skin and ear irritations like she used to. This one, the New Zealand Venison, and the Lamb are her favorites.

review/text: My dog is allergic and my vet suggested to change its food. After reading the ingredients of this product, I thought it would be a good option. When the product arrived, I mixed it with his previous food to make it a gradual change but my dog only ate the previous food. Maybe he didn't like the taste. I had to feed him in the mouth but he vomits it. The first time this happened I thought it was maybe due to anything else so I feed him with Nature's variety food again and he did vomit again. I just wasted my money and my poor dog had a hard time with this food.

I would recommend this for any owner of large dogs or hard chewers.  It also cleans their teeth.  And seems to be cheaper here than other places I've looked.

I've heard from other large dog owners that this is one of the best, longest lasting rope toys out there.  Great for cleaning dogs teeth and playing tug.  It is a little heavy and you have to be watchful about playing with it near small children and flat screen tvs.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it for other owners of large dogs.

review/text: I have a German Shepherd dog, and she can chew through ANY toy that I put in front of her. The chew toys labeled as "tough" are no match for her - they are chewed up in about 10-15 minutes. This toy really, really lasts. I'll have to throw it away because it is dirty before she will every completely chew it up. She is a big girl, and this toy actually has some weight to it and is solid, so she really enjoys pushing/carrying it around. It has the added bonus of keeping her teeth nice and clean.

She loves it, and we love it.<br /><br />The only thing about this toy for us is it is strictly an outdoor toy, because it makes a crazy mess from all the string chunks & bits. BUT, my girl has been able to spend more time in the backyard since getting the Mammoth Fist Ball because it keeps her occupied enough to prevent her from eating the swing set mulch, grass, the kid's toys, digging--you name it!<br /><br />Highly recommend for chewers!

It cleans his teeth and is fun to play tug of war with - what more can you ask for?  The downside is it does leave little bits of threads on the carpet and you need to make sure your dog doesn't swallow them.  I'd recommend as a durable toy.

review/text: cool idea but the item was poorly packaged and the cover of the set was stained with spices that had leaked out of their containers. Since this is a food item, it should have been completely sealed and not only were the individual spice containers not sealed, but the box came in a non-sealed plastic bag. Also, the kit was a bit smaller than I was anticipating (I guess not entirely a bad thing) AND the ratio of mixed spices (like "italian seasoning", "mexican seasoning", etc) to pure spices was a little dissapointing - I would have liked to get more pure spices.

review/text: I have to admit, I would not be one to go to the store and pick out the muffin mix that said "Oat Bran" on the front.  It just doesn't sound all that appetizing to me.  However, I was raised on these muffins, so I know better than to look at their name alone.  These really are the best muffins out there.  I was disappointed not to be able to find them in any local stores, so I ordered them here on Amazon.com, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase.  Simple preparation (mix with water, pour into muffin tin, bake for 20 minutes) and delicious results.  I eat mine with butter and fresh out of the oven.  You just can't beat it.  YUMMY!

I was delighted when I found it on Amazon. I like the fact that you only have to add a cup of water to the mix, not milk and egg, like so many others. Wonderful taste and so easy. I always use the paper muffin cups when I bake them.

review/text: I have used Krusteaz's Oat Bran Muffin mix for 3 years. It is my breakfast "start off". Instead of water I add juice (almost any kind), then nuts, and whole fruit, cranberries, blueberries, bananas, peaches, raisins.  The mixture is such that is holds the fruits well and makes a very filling breakfast food. The one thing negative is not many stores carry Krusteaz's Oat Bran, they carry other Krusteaz mixes, but not Oat Bran. I resorted to ordering it on line by the case, no more "hunting" for the Oat Bran mix. Please don't stop making it Krusteaz.

review/summary: SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
review/text: These are FANTASTIC & the best part is you only have to add water & w/ my experience I didn't even have to spray/etc my Wilton non-stick muffin pan!  Does it get any easier??!!!  I can't believe how easy these are & how good & homemade they taste.  They filled the house w/ wonderful smells.  I had read all the reviews (thank you for those that posted reviews) & decided to give them a try & AM SOOOOO GLAD I DID.  At first, I didn't want to have to buy 12 boxes, but these are so good I'm glad I have 12 boxes to make...LOL.  I made 2 boxes the first day.  With 2 boxes I made 2 batches of 12 regular sized muffins each = 2 dozen.  They were mid-sized muffins (not mini, not jumbo).  I utilized a Wilton non-stick 12 regular size muffin pan & didn't even have to use any spray/etc.  These popped right out.  I didn't even have to go around them w/ anything to loosen them to remove.  I let them cool 5 minutes in the pan as suggested & then literaly twisted out w/ my hand & they came right out.  Highly recommend for following reason:  only have to add water, don't have to use any spray/etc on non-stick muffin pan, wonderful taste/homemade taste, healthier muffin, rave reveiws from anyone that has had them.  My only complaint is how they ship.  I am really picky on things being shipped sanitarily especially when it comes to food.  Amazon ships this in it's actual box which has an opening on the top where the 2 flaps come together - where the flaps come together is about 2 inches wide & as a result the top of every box is exposed to some degree.  The 2 flaps do not actually come together which would be different & not as worrysome.  This may not bother some, but on a food item I would like them to put this box into another box to ship.  Amazon did reship, but they reshipped in it's box again & the only difference is they had a piece of tape over the opened area.  This made me feel a little better, but I still feel it would be best to ship in another box.  It would be different if the top wasn't actually open w/ a 2 inch gap.<br /><br />OVERALL:  These are so good & not available @ stores that I will order again.  Other than how Amazon ships these, these are FANTASTIC in every way!!!!

review/summary: Quick, easy and very good muffin mix ~
review/text: Just received this box of muffin mixes today and made my first 1/2 batch...this is the main reason I ordered this mix is because you only add water and mix so I can make smaller amounts.  I ordered a donut hole maker and wanted to be able to make one batch at a time and 1/2 the box of mix and 1/2 cup water made 8 donut holes...perfect for me.  The box says it makes 6 regular muffins.<br /><br />The taste is pretty good for a boxed mix...a bit sweet on the tongue - but not too sweet.  A good flavor, a nice moist cake-like texture - I will be happy to eat these occasionally mornings or with coffee or tea for a snack.  Much better than a cake mix..this has substance.  I will try the trick of adding oats to the mix before the water to see how it changes the mix...hopefully it will turn out great.  I can see adding chopped apple and cinnamon - maybe some nuts to the batter for a change.  Can't wait to experiment.<br /><br />Upon shipment, the outer box must have been thrown around because the boxes were crushed on the corners - good thing the mix is enclosed inside a plastic bag and then boxed so the mix was okay.  I would order this again for the ease of fresh muffins in a flash.  For 5 stars it would have to be just like homemade.

review/summary: My favorite muffins and SO easy to make
review/text: I have bought these muffins for years at a local grocery store, but amazon's price is even better than my store's (especially with subscribe-and-save).  I bake several kinds of Krusteaz muffins once a month or so, then freeze them and have a couple for breakfast most mornings.  (They also make great, quick, pretty healthy snacks.)  These muffins are wonderful as they are (all you have to do is add water to the mix), but sometimes I add a riped mashed banana or two or some blueberries.  I've also sprinkled cinnamon on top before baking once or twice.  All variations turn out absolutely delicious right out of the oven (I have never added butter to muffins -- to each his/her own!).  They freeze great too, as I mentioned!<br /><br />If you like oatmeal cookies, you will love these muffins -- they're not quite as sweet but the yummy taste is very similar.<br /><br />So glad amazon carries them and I LOVE the subscribe-and-save price -- it is HALF of what these cost in some grocery stores!

review/summary: Not equivalent to "real" casava flour, plus the price is a rip-off
review/text: My wife is from the Philippines and loves to cook the foods that she grew up with (see for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/9625932453">Food of the Philippines</a>). It is often difficult to get certain raw ingredients here in the U.S., even from specialty stores. Recently when she was planning to bake some sweets that use casava flour, we could not find the flour locally and so we went to Amazon to see if it was available. We found it and immediately ordered two pounds of the flour from this supplier, because we needed it quickly.<br /><br />This flour is not equivalent to what she is used to using from her hometown. The particular recipe that she used it for was "kutsinta", which in the above cookbook has been adapted to use rice flour and is translated as "brown rice cake". The recipe that my wife uses is the one that she grew up with and is used locally in the Philippines, which requires casava flour.<br /><br />When cooked using this casava flour, the kutsinta sweets turned out "cloudy" rather than "clear", and the texture was also not correct. So unfortunately this casava flour is not equivalent to what is needed in order to make her authentic recipe come out correct, at least not for this example. My wife was sceptical about this flour being suitable as soon as she saw it, because the color and texture was also not the same as what she was used to, but she did give it a try.<br /><br />Additionally and with respect to the price being charged here on Amazon, I have since done some further checking, which I should have done before purchasing it in the first place. I easily determined that the producer of this flour, Barry Farms, has this same exact product available for sale from their own website. Their price is about one third of the price we paid on Amazon from the seller who is distributing it here.<br /><br />So if you want to try this for yourself, I really recommend that at least you go to Barry Farms website and purchase it directly from them, and save yourself some money.<br /><br />Since the flour is not suitable for what we needed, and since the price for it is also unreasonable, I do not see how I could in good conscience recommend purchasing this product on Amazon.<br /><br />We will continue to look for a good source of casava flour here in the U.S. If we do find someplace better, I will amend this review to provide that information as well.<br /><br />UPDATE September, 2012: I noticed that the seller here on Amazon has reduced their price slightly from what it was when I purchased this flour in February. It is still over twice what you will pay if you purchase directly from Barry Farms, though!<br /><br />Caveat emptor!

I can't imagine how many pieces of clothing have been saved in our household through the years because of these little carbona bottles. I keep a supply of all of the different Carbona Stain Devils on hand and when I have a stain, I just match the stain to the right Carbona formula to watch it disappear. They also work on old stains in those cases where I've missed a stain before washing and drying the item. Carbona does make a general stain formula but this doesn't work as well as these stain specific ones. My family thinks I'm a miracle worker when it comes to getting stains out of clothing thanks to these little devils!

review/summary: Best stuff ever
review/text: This stuff is the best for removing stains caused by butter and any type of cooking oil.  It Carbona does not get the stain out nothing will.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I tend to make a mess of myself in the kitchen, usually splattering grease or oil on my shirt and then after washing, when it comes out of the dryer the spots are STILL there. This is the only product I have found that gets it out and I have yet to find a stain or spot of ANY kind that this stuff won't get out. Came 6 in a box which will last me a long time. A really long time if I wear an apron ;)<br />I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: This stuff is magic!
review/text: I am a sloppy eater and always seem to get stuff on my shirts.  Usually they would get washed and the grease stain would set in.  I have never found anything to get out set in grease stains -- until I found this product!  I put some Carbona on the grease stain, then dab on a little bit of Dawn dish liquid and scrub it in with a toothbrush.  I have NEVER had a stain that didn't come out with this combo.  I have saved so many shirts with this stuff!  You will not regret getting it.

review/summary: Best stain remover ever!!!
review/text: We've been using this product for a couple of years, and have never seen anything like it. Although Carbona #5 is specific to fat and grease, it has actually worked on every clothes stain we've had. First time.<br /><br />Nothing can beat this - it's priceless!!

review/text: I've been using Carbona Stain Devils for years.  Because they are for specialized stains and not just general stain use, they work great!

review/summary: Carbona Stain Devils
review/text: This Carbona Stain Devil is great..it was the people I ordered it from that were no too good.  Like I paid for a 6 pk and received one.  Then I called them and they were more than polite to me on the phone.  I was so happy I called because they said they were going to send the other 5 out right away.  I received one again.  I did not call back this time.  But I'll remember who they are and NEVER Order Carbona from them again.  Lesson learned.

review/summary: Very salty even if you don't care about salt levels
review/text: Decent texture.  Not as rubbery as some other bag rice.  Nothing fancy.  The salt is overwhelming even if you aren't looking at the numbers.  I had planned to eat the whole bag for lunch - but the salt was too much.

review/summary: Horrible
review/text: All of their microwavable packets are terrible.  When you open them they actually have a very odd smell and the taste is very bad.  Their box products are 5 stars.
