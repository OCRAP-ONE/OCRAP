review/text: We've used this before and love the taste of it. It goes well with french toast, waffles or pancakes. I've also made cookies with it and they were great, too. I even put a little on my unsweetened shredded wheat. We never use sugar anymore for anything! Try it; it's organic, low glycemic, and delicious. What more can you ask?

review/summary: Agave Deliciousnesss
review/text: These bottles of agave are larger than some of the others you can buy. The price is good, and agave works great in desserts, although it is sometimes hard to put a lot in because it is still kind of expensive. My nephew loves it, whenever he comes over, he always asks specifically for a peanut butter and agave sandwitch. It tastes good, although too sweet to eat plain for my taste. But I never use it plain. Keeping it in the refigerator makes it less runny, and flow slower (more like honey), so you dont use as much.

review/summary: Best Natural Sweetner I've Found
review/text: I really love the versatility of this product.  You can use it in baked goods where it adds a wonderful, moist texture.  You can use it in hot drinks like tea (I use it in green, white, red and herbal teas).  You can add it to cold beverages and you don't get clumps like with powdered sweetners.  It doesn't leave an after taste and you don't have to worry about getting a sugar rush or an artificial sweetner headache.<br /><br />My most unusual use?  That's easy - I love to use it on pancakes and waffles in place of maple syrup! It's especially wonderful when you combine it with real blueberries heated just until they're starting to melt, piled high on a flax or multigrain waffle.

review/summary: Diabetic Friendly and Tastes Great!
review/text: I wish I had known about Agave before! I bought the six-pack from Amazon. It arrived well-packed and with no leakage whatsoever (I believe they have changed the packaging).<br /><br />I use this organic raw blue agave for frozen banana ice cream (two bananas, sliced and frozen; put bananas into food processor, add dash of salt, one teaspoon of vanilla extract, one tablespoon of agave, process until creamy smooth), and on top of my pancakes. Even my wife, a devotee of 'corn syrup' for her pancakes, tried the agave last night and immediately switched over. Very low glycemic. Hence I have been able to toss the watery 'sugar free' maple syrup. Great on biscuits too.<br /><br />I was worried about ordering six bottles. However, we raced through one bottle, gave another to my diabetic brother-in-law, and we are starting to think we should order six more sooner than later.

review/text: I actually bought a small (17oz) bottle at my local grocery store. I wanted to try it out before purchasing in bulk. It really is all they say it is! It is sweet, doesn't have a strange taste or aftertaste, and you need less of it to sweeten. The only drawback is that it seems to go quickly! its a little thinner than honey, and after only a couple uses almost a third of the bottle is gone already!! I guess thats why its sold in bulk! :) My first  impression of it is that it is a great substitute!!! I will definitely be buying a case from amazon soon!

review/summary: Fraudulent
review/text: Yes, I know, I know, agave nectar is supposed to be the answer for for those seeking to address insulin issues, or on low-carb diets, or just want a healthy alternative to sugar, and even honey and maple syrup, let alone high fructose corn syrup and artificial sweeteners. Yes, I've done the research, am personally interested in both organic and low glycemic index products, and used agave nectar for a couple of years myself, proudly serving it to my friends.<br /><br />Despite the great enthusiasm for agave nectar and the endless hype from folks who should know better, I hate to tell you, but it's baloney--a very successful and clever marketing campaign to promote a sweetener that's no better for you, and very likely worse, than many of the other sweeteners it replaces.<br /><br />First, forget any mental image of a "nectar" naturally flowing from the majestic agave cactus; this product is created in factories through a chemical refining process, much the same way as high fructose corn syrup, from the starchy root of the agave plant and is, in fact, a refined high frustose product stripped of any nutrient value. It has a higher fructose content than high frustose corn syrup. While high fructose agave "nectar" won't spike your blood sugar levels, the fructose in it will cause: mineral depletion, liver inflammation, hardening of the arteries, insulin resistance leading to diabetes, cardio-vascular disease, obesity, and may be toxic for use during pregnancy.<br /><br />If you think I'm making this up or shilling for some manufacturer of a competing sweetener, just google "agave fraud" and see for yourself. I wish it were otherwise.<br /><br />On October 27, 2009, the Wall Street Journal reported:<br /><br />"[T]he Glycemic Research Institute, a Washington, D.C., laboratory, issued a warning Friday that diabetics experienced "severe and dangerous side effects" during testing of an agave nectar. "The diabetics passed out on the floor and had to be taken to the hospital," says Ann de Wees Allen, chief of biomedical research at the lab. She declined to say how much of the product the diabetics consumed during the test, saying that would be disclosed after a complete analysis of the results.<br /><br />...<br /><br />The lab has stopped testing agave on humans amid safety concerns. Also, Dr. Allen says the lab refused to test four other agave products after a chemical analysis it commissioned from another lab found they were mixed with high-fructose corn syrup, which was not disclosed on the label. She declined to name the brands."<br /><br />Wikipedia's entry for agave notes: "the extremely high percentage of fructose can be deleterious and can trigger fructose malabsorption, metabolic syndrome, hypertriglyceridemia, decreased glucose tolerance, hyperinsulinemia, and accelerated uric acid formation," citing:<br /><br />Basciano H, Federico L, Adeli K (2005). "Fructose, insulin resistance, and metabolic dyslipidemia". Nutrition & Metabolism 2 (5). doi:10.1186/1743-7075-2-5PMID PMC552336;<br />Mayes, PA (1993). "Intermediary metabolism of fructose".

review/summary: Big deal: it's high in fructose.
review/text: Like high-fructose corn syrup, which is the bane of the health-food crowd, Agave syrup is a low glycemic sweetener simply because it has a high concentration of fructose and a low concentration of glucose. The health pitch is a bit of flim-flam.<br /><br />Agave syrup is about 90 percent fructose, which is at least double the percentage of fructose in commonly used high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). The HFCS used in soft drinks and other foods ranges from 42 percent to 55 percent fructose. There is no evidence that increasing the amount of dietary fructose is a health benefit, and some evidence that it may increase fat around the mid-section, which is most associated with coronary artery disease.<br /><br />If you need a nutritious sweetener, molasses is by far the best choice. It is loaded with calcium, potassium, magnesium, manganese, and other good things. Granted, molasses might not be suitable for all sweetening needs, but when it is suitable it dwarfs agave in nutritional value.<br /><br />Be sure to read the accompanying comments to learn about the hazards of Agave.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FL08B0">Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Raw Blue Agave, 23.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I have a number of health concerns, most particularly, Metabolic Syndrome X (a.k.a Pre-Diabetes or Insulin-Resistance )which causes high blood pressure, heart disease, high chlosterol, and obesity (among other things). My medical doctor simply wanted to prescribe medicines for my condition(s) (i.e. Lipitor, blood pressure medicines, etc.)<br /><br />I finally went to a couple of doctors who were both medically trained and well-versed in alternative medicines. They both suggested that I try agave nectar as my sweetener. When, I asked about other sugar substitutes and I was met with a resounding "No!" for all except stevia products. I was even told to shy away from the sugar alcohols (i.e. xylotol, mannitol, maltitol, sorbitol, erythritol, lactitol, etc.) because although they ar natural and low glycemic, they apparently can cause/exacerbate candida.<br /><br />The long and short of it is that I love the agave nectar! I have found the "Raw", "Blue" Agave to be the best (with the Lowest G.I.). It dissolves easiest in liquids, has no aftertaste whatsoever (compared to natural honey or maple syrup, for example), and is safe for type II diabetics and non-diabetics alike. See: http://www.vegfamily.com/vegan-cooking-tips/agave.htm<br /><br />I am still working on my Metabolic Syndrome X symptoms (I have found some natural blood pressure herbs that work wonderfully <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RI394Y">Circu & Pressure Formula Herbal Supplement</a>) and I'm beginning a regimen designed to help all my symptoms at once (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071499849">The Insulin-Resistance Diet--Revised and Updated</a>, for example).<br /><br />I'll be sure to post an update as to how I do. However, in the meantime, if you're looking for an effective sugar substitute that has no health side effects and no aftertaste, please, please, please consider the raw  blue, agave nectar first and agave nectar of any kind second!

review/text: Blue Agave sweetener is the best I've ever used.  Been using it for over a year now, and has assisted in helping me lose the weight I've needed to.  Compared to using regular sugar as a sweetener, I only have to use 3 teaspoons of Blue Agave, whereas, I would have to use a minimum of 5-6 teaspoons of sugar to get the equivalent taste.  Blue Agave does not cause an increase in blood sugar like real sugar can.<br /><br />I use this on other foods such as, pancakes, waffles, as an ice cream topping and to sweeten just about anything one would normally use sugar for.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with Blue Agave.

It is much sweeter than sugar, so you do not have to use very much at a time.  It doesn't give you that sugar high or jitters and is absorbed into your system at a very slow rate.  I love it!

review/summary: Tasty stuff and apparently, small amounts fuel rampant paranoia
review/text: It tastes better (coffee, tea, cereal, baking, et al.) than processed cane sugar (and ANY artificial sweetener).  Although I am not quite as sensitive to the details of my body's interest in or acceptance of various sweeteners as other reviewers, the stuff seems just fine.  Have used all the various artificial products, and they taste...well, artificial - esp. Truvia which has a vile aftertaste.  Organic, fair trade, and tasty - seems OK to me.  And since I am not a food scientist and lack access to a full-on laboratory (More agave, Igor), I can't comment on web-based assertions of dubious provenance.  As I wrote, tastes good and seems like a sensible alternative to the rest of the crowd.

review/summary: Low Glycemic!!
review/text: This is the best multipurpose sweetener I have ever tasted.  Not only is the sweetener is a replacement for sugar but it can be used for syrup for your pancakes, waffles etc.  It is a low glycemic sugar and it is true that you will not get tired using the sweetener. It is true that the sweetener "slowly absorbs into the body, preventing spikes in blood sugar."  If you find that you are sleepy after you have eaten sugar, then this product is for you because the body slowly absorbs the sugar, you will not get tired as quickly!  The sweetener adds a nectar flavor to your dishes.  I used it in a yams/sweet potato recipe and it worked wonders!

review/text: I bought five bars of marzipan.  They didn't come in a pack.  There were five in a hand-taped plastic baggie.  They were packed so they didn't rattle around and get broken in shipment, but they weren't air-tight by any means and were very stale.  The almond filling was dry and the chocolate cracked and fell into pieces when I sliced it.  I gave some to friends at Christmas, and was embarrassed to discover the quality.  I have had this product before and it was moist and lucious and the dark chocolate coating was melt-in-your-mouth creamy, so I have a standard for comparison.  I was terribly disappointed and will not be buying it through Amazon again.

review/text: I bought this steak for my father in law for Christmas because he had always wanted to try Omaha Steaks, and I heard good things about it. I purchased the private reserve because it is a higher quality of meat than the regular cuts and wanted to get him something extra special, but was I in for a surprise. I should have stuck with the cheaper meat.<br /><br />The meat came with extremely large amounts of fat all around. We had cut off a significant amount of fat prior to cooking,and the steak was still fatty once it was cooked. I was very dissapointed and so was he. We were going to call Omaha Steaks to complain, will never buy this brand again. Very unhappy with it. The taste wasn't even something that was worth raving about either. I could have went to the supermarket and bought a prime rib on sale that tasted better than this was, which i have in the past, and didn't spend nearly as much as they charged.

When they stopped carrying them, I looked around for almost two years to find them in other stores with no luck.  So...I was excited to find them again on Amazon.  But, in that time period, something changed with the product, and the design of the box changed also.  The "peach" flavor is much more artificial now, and is not enjoyable at all.  Also, the tea bags themselves seem to be a lot weaker....I am having to use a lot more of them to create a pitcher of tea that tastes like something other than colored water.  I am highly disappointed, and I will not be purchasing this product ever again.

I have tried other flavors in this line, including tropical (herbal) and lemon black tea (looks like they eliminated this flavor from the product line) and was satisfied enough to try the peach black tea flavor - yuck.<br /><br />While not totally undrinkable, it does not taste like black iced tea with peach, more like a bouquet of artificial flavors with fake cinnamon flavoring, like the one you taste in "hot" cinnamon candies.  Find a good hot tea and go through the trouble of chilling it with ice because this is simply disappointing.

review/summary: Kept us sober
review/text: This tea is simple with a pretty fair hint of peach. We sun brew it and counter brew it. I THINK the counter brew makes the tea taste even better. We once found it at the local WALMART but no more. I quit alcohol a year ago( 30 year drinker) and this tea, with a fair amount of sugar added, is all i drank for months. It helped me ALOT. After drinking this tea, it's all my wife and I drink. She also quit alcohol as well. Now we don't drink the tea to replace anything anymore. After quitting alcohol for over a year now we drink the tea cause it tastes teriffic. The case of tea route is cheaper than even Walmart provided.

review/summary: Good cold brew tea
review/text: Let me start by saying I like unsweetened iced tea, and I have tried many methods and I really like cold brew because its the quick and the least trouble to make.<br /><br />I was staying with my boyfriend at the time and I was complaining that I wanted iced tea so he suggested we pick a box of tea at the grocery store, there were two brands of cold brew to choose from and the Celestial Seasonings was flavored so he suggested we try the peach, it was really delicious I liked the hint of peach instead of putting a lemon wedge in it, very easy to make, and my only dissapointment was that I can't find it anyplace closer to me, as it is over an hour drive to the grocery store we found it at.

review/text: It brews quickly and the flavor is nice, unlike their tropical blend, which, IMO, tastes like some funky berry that's probably going bad. As a tea-aholic, I greatly appreciate Cool Brew tea. I'm not always home and often in places where making tea the old fashioned way or even microwaving would be, at the very least, complicated. But with this, I can easily have tea on the go.<br /><br />Good product. Good price

review/text: This is a great item for people that like iced tea year round.  It is perfect for work because you juar put the tea bag in a cold glass of water and in 5 minutes you have a nice glass of iced tea.  I prefer the peach flavor. Or you can use 4 or 5 bags to make a pitcher.  I also just squeeze a bag into my bottled water when I am on the go.

review/summary: Hibiscus-y and Raspberry-esque!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/summary: Sweet and Delicious
review/text: *****<br />Stash's Licorice Spice Caffeine Free Herbal Tea has a the sweet flavor licorice teas are known for, along with several nice spices that complement the licorice in a lovely, more-subtle-than-chai way. Licorice Spice Tea contains licorice root, cinnamon, orange peel, star anise, sarsaparilla, natural vanilla flavor, natural orange flavor, natural clove flavor, natural cardamom flavor, and natural cinnamon flavor. Sweet and delicious!<br /><br />You don't need to add anything at all to Licorice Spice Tea, even if you normally like your tea sweetened. It is perfect just as is. It also has a very smooth taste, despite all of the flavorings. The tea bags come stamped with an expiration date, which I like, so that you can be sure the tea is fresh. The date on mine is 26 months away, so you can take your time :)<br /><br />Definitely recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Delicious; great condiment!
review/text: This is my 2nd favorite balsamic vinegar, behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0082BFS7O">BOTTE PICCOLA Balsamic Vinegar 250 ML</a> which is produced by the same family. I'd say this one is 85% as good, while being less than half the price. This balsamic is still a world ahead of anything else I've had here in the US, even in this price range.<br /><br />This one is just a little thick, edging its way towards being syrupy but not there yet. It's more runny than the Botte Piccola, but the flavor profile is very similar. This one is slightly less sweet, slightly more harsh & tangy, but still quite far away from anything unpleasant.<br /><br />Both of these balsamics are good on just about anything: salad, chicken, pasta, fruit... They are very flavorful so it doesn't take much, but if you're anything like me you'll still go through them relatively fast because you'll find yourself using it every day. Start out with a bottle but don't be surprised if you find yourself finding ways to justify ordering it by the crate!

review/text: This is a hearty and flavorful tomato soup with a hint of parmesan.  It contains 30% less sodium than their regular soups.<br /><br />If you're a cheese lover, this soup has a robust cheese flavor--yummy!<br /><br />This soup has no MSG, and it is low in sodium.  It has 1/2 cup of veggies per serving, and it is low in fat.<br /><br />A serving size is one cup, and the can contains 2 servings.  Each serving is 80 cal, 5 fat cal, 1 g fat, 480 g sodium, 18 g carb, 3 g fiber,  1g soluable fiber, 9 g sugar, and 3 g protein.<br /><br />The ingredients include tomato puree (water tomato paste), water, tomatoes, onions, 1.5% modified food starch, sugar, salt, parmesan cheese (part skim milk, cheese, cultures, salt, enzymes), potassium chloride, cream, parsley, butter, corn protein, (hydorolized), maltodextrin, yeast extract, garlic powder, natural flavor, calcium chloride, spice oregano, sodium phosphate, citrus acid, and onion powder.<br /><br />The allergy alert states that the soup may contain milk.<br /><br />I also like this soup because the vendors state it has 2-1 cup servings which is 16 oz.  This soup gives you 18.5 oz. of delicious soup.<br /><br />This soup is made in the USA by General Mills, Inc., Minneapolis, MN.  The soup also has an expiration date stamped on the bottom of the can.

review/summary: Best Organic Baby Food by Far
review/text: Earth's Best Baby Food<br />My favorite brand of baby food by far. Both my son (who is now over 2 years old) and my daughter (now almost one) have used a wide variety of foods from Earth's Best. I am a huge proponent of feeding children primarily organic and/or locally grown foods to promote proper nutrition and growth. But I do not feel that all organic brands are equal. I've tried many varieties (including store brands and others only available through internet purchase) and found that Earth's Best is by far the best for your money.<br /><br />Fruit & Whole Grain Combo, Peach - Oatmeal - Banana<br />This variety was a huge hit with my son and was given to him most every day until about a year and a half. My daughter on the other hand hasn't taken to it. All children are not created equally and each has their likes and dislikes. I'm still hopeful that she'll take to this, but for now it's a no go. That's why I'm giving it four stars as opposed to five. Although, I would say this flavor is definitely worth a try for any child who has moved passed the basic stage one foods.
