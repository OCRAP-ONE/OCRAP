review/summary: pucker face :->
review/text: These are not as chewy as the ones I have bought in bulk from the store, but that is likely due to the packaging and being fresh (not sitting in open bulk bins).  They taste great though; they made me make a pucker face, and as they are individually wrapped I am not over-eating them till my tongue is sore like I do with bulk belts.  I was trying to find a product that I could take on road trips, and that is not made with high fructose corn syrup or made in China. These Sour Power belts are made in Holland and distributed through Dorval Trading in NY. The size of each belt is 3/4 x 7.5 inches. The ingredients listed on this page are exactly what is on the product label.

review/summary: Same great childhood taste.
review/text: I grew up eating sourpower straws/belts as a child with my best friends, and it came to my surprise that Amazon even sold these. I quickly purchased it ($15 for 150, that's only 10 cents each!) and the shipping was fast as usual. 150 sourpower belts that are individually wrapped is more than worth the price tag. It had the same great taste and sourness that only sourpower could provide. Highly RECOMMEND these to anyone who likes sourpower products or sour tasting candy.

review/text: These belts are so good! I am eating one as I write this review. They are soft and extremely sour (but not too sour). I also like that they come individually wrapped in high-quality plastic. This product comes with 150 pieces and weighs 3lbs 4.90z, so as far as I can tell, we are only paying a slight premium for the individual wrappers.

review/summary: Sour Power Addict
review/text: Oh MY, do I love these! These are SO. DELICIOUS. They are soft and fresh because of its packaging. While that packaging is a bit wasteful, they really keep me in check. If they weren't individually packaged, I would probably have finished off the box within a week. As it is, when I see the carnage of all the packaging, it ususally shames me into slowing me down. LOL.<br /><br />Other similar sour candies are not sour enough for me. But these ones have the perfect balance of sour and sweetness. YUM!<br /><br />Five of these sour power candies have 191 calories, 45 grams of carbs and 32 grams of sugar. Ouch. There is nothing nutritional about these suckers. BUT they are delicious and with some moderation, aren't TOO too bad as far as junk goes. After I eat them, I always drink some water to help rinse some of the sugar off of my teeth OR brush my teeth, if possible.<br /><br />I have had the box for about 4 months and because they are individually packaged, I can take my time eating them. I expect that in another 4 months, I will probably be finished.

review/text: How in the world do you review a gummy worm?  Well, I think it's all about expectations.<br /><br />Was it huge?  Yes.  About 3 feet.<br />Was it bigger than I thought it would be?  Without a doubt.<br />Was it big and heavy enough that it was slightly comical?  Absolutely.<br /><br />Consistency: Consistency is on par with other gummy candy.  In fact, I the texture is slightly tougher than the average American gummy.  It reminded me of gummy candy that I got in Germany.<br /><br />Taste: While not as concentratedly sour as candy much smaller, the sour green flavor is definitely detectable.  And pleasant as well!<br /><br />This product is exactly what you'd expect.  It is an eye-opening jaw-dropper that looks cool, weighs more than you'd think (4 lbs), tastes good, and will probably last a month of consistent eating.

I also purchased a Melita decaf as well, and thought it to be too strong. This coffee is as decaffeinated as it gets! No jitters, even on those days I have more than 2 cups. I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers who can no longer enjoy the caffeine and who would like to avoid the chemicals associated with traditional decaf.

I made three pots in a very good coffeemaker and nothing I did improved the flat nothing taste of this coffee.  It also was no better for stomach irritation that other coffees I have tried.  I took a chance when I bought this coffee because it is non-returnable.  I have spent less money for much better tasting coffee.  Amazon seldoms disappoints me with the quality of their products.  Healthwise Gourmet Coffee, is something I would have been better to do without.

review/text: This coffee is bold enough and quite tasty in DeCaf.  I have GERD so the low acid helps a lot without robbing any flavor, in my opinion.  It costs a lot more than the 100% Columbian Decaf I was using (otherwise, 5 stars) but the lower acid is worth something.  I must like it because I reordered it from Amzaon after the trial from the maker.

It is a nice change from my usual popular gourmet coffee choice, and I have prepared a very refreshing iced coffee by strengthening the ratio of coffee to water.

I have a case of decaf on hand as I certainly don't want to run out!

review/summary: HealthWise Decaf Coffee
review/text: I do not particularly care for this coffee. However, in all fairness to the product - this was my last ditch effort to find a decaf coffee that I like. I truly enjoy regular Colombian, organic coffee. I have tried other, non-organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable, please do not take my review as "gospel". I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1/2 cups of coffee in the morning. So, I'm not abusing caffeine. However, I think I just enjoy the flavor of "real" coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently, I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my "caffeine free" goal. :-)

review/summary: Better than anything I've encountered.
review/text: My 6-month-old bichon frise puppy takes after his mommy in that he's a very picky eater. This is the only brand of dog food he's eaten without making a fussy face. I'm sold!<br /><br />We had him on Royal Canin for about 2 months until we came across Bil Jac. Originally, it was a freebie from our pet supply store. I put it right next to his Royal Canin and the answer was obvious. He loved it. And why wouldn't he? It's made of real chicken and chicken organs, which provides a natural source of fat.<br /><br />I went through the ingredient list and did my own research. Arginine plays an important role in cell division, the healing of wounds, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. I went a bit further and asked my vet. He told me that puppies less than 1 year old are unable to create arginine internally, and although it's not an essential amino acid, it's always a good idea to include it in a puppy's nutrition.<br /><br />Bil Jac is slow cooked for over 40 minutes, and that ensures more nutrients are retained during the process. And the fact that there's no sprayed-on fat, corn gluten meal, wheat gluten meal, or less expensive proteins sold me.<br /><br />My vet approved. My budged approved. Most importantly, my puppy gave it the paws up. I'm sticking with Bil Jac all throughout his adult years!

review/summary: A Big Ripoff!
review/text: I bought this thing after a recommendation from a pet store rep. My dog hardly touched the stuff, and then I looked at the ingredients: one of the first things on it was corn-a grain known to cause allergies in dogs. As a matter of fact, corn might be the most allergy-prone food amongst dogs. Not to mention, thanks to our friends at Monsanto, it is almost always Genetically modified (GMO) or a franken-food, unless it's organic. Real "premium" dog foods brag that they've no corn.<br /><br />Right at the top of the list of ingredients is chicken-by-products, another no-no among real "premium" dog foods. This means all the waste that it is usually thrown out from the chicken since it's not real meat. Cheap dog foods put this in their food simply because it's cheap, but it's not real meat. A little further down you will notice BHA, an artificial preservative, which again real "premium" dog foods do not have.<br /><br />In short, BilJac is a joke. It is basically, insanely overpriced Alpo, with no organic ingredients whatsoever, and uses all the shortcuts, filler, and chemistry that the cheapest dog foods on the market use. Don't be fooled by the old-fashioned appeal of the company's 60 years in business. There is nothing but modern chemistry in the bag, and all the folksy appeal will not make up for cheap, lousy ingredients. I ended up buying Blue Buffalo Wilderness and I have not looked back.

review/text: I received a complimentary bag of Bil Jac dog food through BzzAgent.com .  Before I could even get the food poured into my puppy's dish, she was already  pawing at the bag trying to get at the food.  She went nuts for it and immediately refused to eat her old food.  This food requires no transition time, so I immediately switched her to Bil Jac and she has had no digestive problems at all.  I have had to start measuring out her food because she'd eat way more than she needs if I let her.  She is only 4lbs at 8 months old, and the small breed puppy food is very easy for her to chew.  This is definitely the best dog food we've tried and the one we'll stick with.

review/summary: So Yummy!!
review/text: I bought this tuna when it was on sale to try on a salad. I was hoping to jazz it up a bit from regular tuna. This is really, really GOOD stuff. You can peel the can open easily, so it's great to take to work or in the car for a snack when traveling. My husband loves them too--we make sandwiches and bruschetta all the time. Great for Panini. Handy and yummy, and worth the price.

review/summary: Best Loganberry Jam
review/text: This Jam is about the best Loganberry I have found in recent years. Loganberry Jam is very hard to find in retail stores. I'm told that the berries are no longer as commercially viable as other berries..something about the berries ripening at different times.  Pioneer Valley Loganberry Jam has a fresh, tart flavor and is very true to the flavor of fresh loganberries.

review/summary: Durable and keeps the dogs busy and interested
review/text: I purchased the unfortunately named "Pickle Pocket" from Petco.  My two labrador retrievers have varying levels of interest in treat dispensing toys.  I like the design of this toy as it seems to be indestructable (as much as anything can be called that when you're talking about dogs) yet easy on their teeth.  The toy is about 5 inches long and has 3 grooves that you can tuck treats into.  I put some treats deep into the grooves, and leave others closer to the top.  This keeps them engaged for up to an hour, sometimes longer.<br /><br />Both dogs seem to enjoy this toy very much, so much so that I am going to buy another one so they can each have one.  I paid less than the $20.99 though and $7.99 is a rip-off.  This can be purchased at Petco for around $15!

review/summary: good choice for those trying to make the switch to whole wheat
review/text: Okay, first off...if you can't stand regular Kraft Mac-n-Cheese don't bother with this product.  It's a LOT like regular Kraft MnC. It's been made with pasta with 50% whole grain.  Okay, nice compromise there; the 100% whole wheat pastas can be a bit grainy tasting but we know we all need less white flour in our diets.<br /><br />Now, you're discerning 5 year old will probably be able to tell the difference between this and regular Kraft MnC and if he or she is uber-picky about change, demands a certain brand, etc, well, then, this won't fool him.  But my kids ate it up fine.  The 9 year old barely noticed anything different (but she likes WW pastas), the 7 yo who normally doesn't like WW MnC ate it, although could tell it was WW.  The 2.5 year old just kept shoveling it in with his bare hands; I guess that means he liked it.<br /><br />So in a nutshell, this is a worthwhile product to try if you're kids like Kraft MnC.  Same flavor as far as the sauce goes at least.  Same shape of noodles.  The fiber content for a serving of this is a respectable 5g, up from 1g for the tradtional stuff.  Not bad.<br /><br />Of note is the fact that this product has only 6oz in a box as opposed to the 7.25oz in the traditional MnC.<br /><br />For comparison's sake, I usually buy the Hogson Mill 100% WW Mac-n-Cheese.  I found this a bit milder tasting as far as wheaty-ness goes; makes sense as Kraft uses a blend and HM is 100% whole wheat.  My picky eater will eat the Kraft but not the HM.  Hope that helps those of you with similar customers to feed.  I found the Kraft brand in my stores for a little less money than what it's being sold on Amazon for, but it might be hard to find in the stores for many people.

review/summary: Great easy meal with some fiber
review/text: This is one of my favorite quick meals. (I usually divide the pasta and cheese powder in halves.) Just a 5 minute boil, to keep it from getting too soft (it says 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 minutes), and a quick mix of the cheese powder with milk and butter and you're done. Reduce your intake of white flour and get some (5g) fiber too!

review/text: Perhaps it's because we haven't had "regular" mac-n-cheese for a long time, but this product didn't taste any wheatier or different to me than good ol' Mac-n-cheese. Our whole family gobbles it up (11, 7, 2 and my husband & myself) and I love that it has a good amount of fiber. Never had issues with it falling apart as the other reviewer mentioned, but you do have to be careful with all mac-n-cheese pastas as they are so small, they do over-ook very quickly.

review/summary: Good price. Good product. Not too grainy for whole grain
review/text: My family went to eating all whole grains several years ago while doing the South Beach diet. We gave up mac and cheese reluctantly and tried several "other" brands to satisfy the craving. None could compete. If you grew up on Kraft mac 'n' cheese with the bright yellow might-be-cheese sauce, you miss it.  My daughter loves mac but would only get it at "Grandma's" house because I didn't keep it around much.  I was excited to find out about this product, but only to find no local stores who carried it. Thank you, Amazon! It is well worth the price and tastes just like the original, just with a stronger wheat flavor.  I felt the cheese sauce should be made a little stronger to compensate for the strong wheat flavor of the pasta. We don't mind the wheat taste, but some other people aren't as fond of it. If you don't care for the taste of whole wheat pasta, this probably isn't for you. We, however, will definitely reorder.

review/text: I am always looking for ways to add a little fiber to our diet.  This does just have a little fiber, but it's a lot better than the other kraft mac and cheese products, with the same taste my kids love.  They turned their noses up at the other brands of mac and cheese that have more fiber.  They never notice any difference with this.

review/summary: A healthier option, but not great
review/text: There's something off about the pasta. While much closer to the regular pasta than Whole Wheat, which is way to grainy, the pasta here tends to kind of fall apart (only way I can describe it). But from a health aspect its better than normal blue box mac and cheese. And the taste is comparable.<br /><br />I know this sounds horrible and a total waste of cash, but occationally I'll buy this, toss the pasta and replace it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00135XQCK">Barilla Plus Penna Pasta~2pk~14.5oz Boxes~</a> which is 1000 times tastier than the pasta in this box, suffers none of the high grain of whole wheat, and is chock full of protein and Omega 3's, and overall healthier and more sustaining --  because its got protein.<br /><br />I keep wishing Kraft would just start selling the packets of cheese powder without the pasta (they do actaully <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1T6I">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Topper, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 8)</a>but its currently more expensive than just buying the box and tossing the pasta).

review/summary: Macaroni integrity is the pits
review/text: I have bought this at my local grocery store, and tried it several times before giving up on it.  It tasted very similar to regular Kraft Macaroni & Cheese, but no matter how little I tried cooking the pasta I could not get it to an al dente state such that the noodles didn't fall apart as soon as I started stirring to create the cheese sauce.  I think the last time I made it I cooked the noodles for 5 1/2 minutes (the box recommends 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 minutes) and they still fell apart.  Eating this was like eating macaroni shreds and cheese, not macaroni and cheese.<br /><br />My 21-month old son will eat this, but he prefers the regular version. I do, too, so we're giving up on this one.

review/summary: Whole grain with trans fat
review/text: This product makes it sound healthy having 50% whole grains in the pasta however the part that everyone should be aware of is the 3.5g of trans fat. Trans fat is chemically made to prolong the shelflife of products and it is not good for ur health. Eating this each day is unhealthy due to the enormous amount in each serving. I suggest buying one that contains 0 or at minimal .5g trans fat if u must.

That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.

review/summary: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, QUALITY DOG FOOD!!!
review/text: I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!

review/summary: Canidae 12-Pack Canned Dog Food, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth, 5-1/2-Ounce Can
review/text: I switched to the smaller cans because I have a Yorkie, and it took too long for her to finish the larger cans.  But to me, all Canidae products are great.  Let me tell you what happened.  Three years ago, my little dog had hot spots all over her.  She was miserable, itching, scratching, moping around.  I took her to the vet who gave me a cream which didn't help.  Then one time, I went to my groomer who told me the truth:  SHE'S ALLERGIC!  These hot spots are Alergies!!!  Huh?  Why didn't the vet tell me this?  (Was it because he was also selling the other dog food I was using?)  The groomer suggested I look for a product that had no corn.  I liked the Amazon reviews about Canidae products and tried it.  Not only did she take to the change right away, (although I gradually changed food) but her hot spots cleared up.  Needless to say, Canidae products are all I use now.  I don't care that they are a little more expensive!  They cleared up my poor dog's misery, and that's all that counts!

review/text: I am trying to get my dogs (all shelter dogs although one is purebred) off low-quality grain-based foods and bought this to add to their high quality lamb and rice kibble, which they eat well.  They wouldn't eat it at first, and then only grudgingly.  I am going to try again, but I am distressed because I don't like throwing out food.  I will try mixing in some cheaper stuff and trying to move toward feeding this.  But I am warning anyone who is trying this that it isn't immediately appealing to my five totally different (and hungry) dogs.

We decided to give it a try and our Collie/Lab was hesitant b/c of all the junk her previous owners had fed her.  The Yorkies and even the cat immediately jumped in to chow down.  Our Collie/Lab has now decided this food is great and we even purchased the dry food to go along with it.

review/summary: Quality dog food, but he still can't have it...
review/text: For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues.

review/text: My westie and yorkie eat this canned food and I thought I might find it slightly less expensive on Amazon.<br />I found this one and saw the picture of the large dog food which is normally what I buy at the pet store.  It appeared cheaper by a little after considering the shipping cost.<br />I was very disappointed in finding out after shipping cost I actually paid .54 cents more than my pet store!  But then it was worse!!! The cans were more than half the size of the picture!  I contacted customer service and told them I should have read the description, however, the picture was of the larger can.  They offered a return, I would have been stupid again to pay $16+ total in shipping to and from to get a $14 credit.<br />I told customer service the picture was misleading and she said she wasn't sure on this product, but in the past they've told Amazon they have wrong pictures on certain items and Amazon does nothing about it! I don't know if it was their fault or Amazon's fault, but I do know I paid DOUBLE!  I have purchased a lot of items on Amazonb and this is the first time I've felt CHEATED.

Not the case, the cocoa is just in the boxes and not in a bag in the box. The cardboard box is flimsy and the edges are not sealed. What a waste of good product! I couldn't figure out the best was to store it because every time I touched the box it would poof out and make a mess. I ended up having to buy a separate container to store it.

Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my brownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes.

Over the decades I had not used it, until I recently bought several boxes on Amazon.com.<br /><br />The cocoa powder is excellent and makes a delicious and easy-to-make hot chocolate drink.  But I was very disappointed with the packaging.  The powder was in a box without a bag or a sealed lid.  Consequently it leaked and it was a mess.  I gave one box as a gift and had to seal it in a sealed small freezer bag before gift wrapping it.<br /><br />Droste could do better on the packaging.  Hershey does.<br /><br />I rate the cocoa powder 5 stars and I rate the packaging 1 star.  Therefore and overall, I rate Droste's Dutch Processed Cocoa 3 stars.<br /><br />Steve Riehle

review/summary: Fix it up with Spam and REALLY go to town
review/text: I thrive on these mashed potatoes, and also the equally excellent Betty Crocker Loaded Mashed Potatoes. I think I can hear an inner voice of my mother telling me 60 years ago that I shouldn't like prepared foods, but I ignore that voice a lot. These are extremely easy to make (I heat my water for four minutes in an 1100 watt microwave), and they taste pretty good just as they are.<br /><br />Of course, I rarely leave things just as they are. I sometimes add in some milk with my water. It gives the potatoes a richer taste. I also dice various versions of Spam, mix in some canned string beans and pitted black olives, heat everything up, and mix it in with the potatoes. That way it becomes a quick and easy entree.<br /><br />I suppose homemade mashed potatoes have their points. Just try making them when you're over 60. This product starts looking pretty attractive at that point. And the texture is actually better than the best homemade potatoes I've had (most homemade versions usually just end up lumpy, though).<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend these. Don't pay attention to those inner voices telling you otherwise. This is a winner.

review/summary: Quick and easy
review/text: I am not a huge fan of instant potatoes but these are better than many others on the market. They are quick and easy to fix when your running late and everyone seems to like them. Amazon makes it even easier by selling at a comparable price to the stores and shipping. It's nice to have them on hand when I'm rushed or unexpected guests show up and I need more in a hurry.

review/text: We use instant mashed potatoes a lot but these - I'm not sure what these are. The taste is horrible. Cannot describe it short of an almost spoiled sour cream taste. Off to toss the rest of the packs because they are truly that bad.

review/text: This is my first time trying BC mashed potatoes.  They are very good.  It gives you a choice of making them with just water or milk and water. To me they tasted  more like homemade with just water with butter added. Good to have on hand for quick and easy.

review/summary: Not bad....VERY convenient.
review/text: These are good in a pinch, especially since they don't need milk, which I always seem to be out of (no little ones at home). Although the other Betty Crocker mashed potatoes that do require milk has a better texture and fluff up better, with these you just need to watch the amount of water, or they'll end up too thin. They have a slight butter taste without that fake butter taste. Serve them up plain, with butter, with gravy, or any other way.<br />Now, I'm off to order more...

review/summary: Surprisingly Good Considering You Only Add Water
review/text: These couldn't be easier.  You pour one packet into a bowl, add 2 cups of cold water, and microwave for 3-4 minutes.  They are already flavored, although I did add butter to mine as I didn't initially anticipate that they would be flavorful on their own.<br /><br />They have a bit of a sour bite which implies that there is some sour cream in the seasoning (I didn't bother to check).  It's not overbearing, but my first few bites took me aback a little as I was expecting more of the usual blandness from powdered mashed potatoes.  I also didn't need to add any salt, but I wouldn't say they were too salty; just right.<br /><br />I thought the flavor, texture, and quantity were good and better than many instant mashed potato products I've tried.  Each packet says it makes 4 servings (that would be 1/2 cup each); I would usually eat more than that for a serving; but they are filling, like real potatoes.  I'd guess for most people a packet makes 2-3 servings.

review/summary: Exactly enough for two people.
review/text: No leftovers going to waste, no measuring and no trouble.  Just add the water/milk and microwave.  One pouch means one meal and there's nothing to reseal.  This is probably the best plain instant potatoes brand I've tried.  They really taste "real" and they taste great!  We stock these in the pantry for everyday eating, camping, and for those emergencies like power outages, blizzards, and zombie attacks etc.

review/summary: tolerable at most
review/text: While I prefer homemade mashed potatoes, I am a busy Mom so I have to use instant quite often. I was hoping for a new taste with these, instead I have a case and a half of something we will not eat again. My husband s a Marine, and will eat almost anything except mushrooms, cauliflower and now these potatoes. Even my kids hate them and they will eat anything in the pantry and fridge! The only thing I like is the size of the package which is perfect for a family with 2 younger kids.
