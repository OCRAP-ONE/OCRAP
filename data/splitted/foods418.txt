review/summary: mmmmmmfor chocolate lovers you gotta try this one
review/text: I am not usually a lover of dark chocolate, but when a friend gave me this chocolove premium dark (55%) orange peel as a gift, I fell in love with it. So for Valentine's I decided to buy a box and give my special friends a bar for a happy. Now they are all addicted. The orange peel gives it a special little tang and crunch at the end and I would recommend it to any chocolate lover. It was funny that each person said they could not hold out to make it last a whole day like I had challenged them to. It is just too good.

review/text: Not only have i had just about everry brand of belgian chocolate this side of the atlantic, i have had this one several times.  But this seller sent bad chocolate. It has a powdery appearance and is very brittle to touch and taste.  Can't eat it at all.  And i guess i can't return it either.

review/text: I treat myself to Chocolove at my local health food store once a month.  I am very conservative on how much sugar I have, so I make one bar last me a whole month.  Yes, it has real sugar, but it is so delightful for the amount of sugar that it has.  A taste of heaven.  I buy the 70% cacao and I am hooked! Seductive bliss!  One more thing, if you are in to dark chocolate, the taste is quite smooth, not bitter as some darks go.

review/text: This is the best chocolate bar I've ever tried.  The salty taste is in perfect balance with the chocolate.  I'm not the only one that thinks so, since our local grocery store sells out of this particular bar almost as soon as they arrive.  The other Chocolove bars are fine, but this one is tops.

review/summary: Excellent Dark Chocolate.
review/text: My husband and I occasionally enjoy a few pieces of dark chocolate in the evening and this chocolate is a real treat. It is hard to find such good chocolate at less than $3 per bar. We order a couple cases each fall and keep them in the freezer till we need a new bar. This is not bitter chocolate and just 1/6 (3 small squares) of a bar is only 80 calories and satisfies our desires for dark chocolate.

review/text: I first tried this at a small coffee shop and the memory of the taste haunted me until I found it on Amazon.  It is a wonderfully decadent treat in which to indulge, whether to forget your bad day or to reward yourself for a job well done. You can taste the real orange peel shavings in this chocolate and it is that perfect blend of dark chocolate and orange, which is the most divine combination.

You know, like buy bar A and then bar B and then eat 'em both.<br /><br />YEARS of doing this shamelessly has led me to become a regular purchaser of Chocolove's Pure Dark.  The 55% one.<br /><br />I don't care much for their other bars -- they're just so-so -- but DANG! the Pure Dark is crazy-good.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor.  Don't just buy this bar.  Buy this bar and then buy ten other chocolate bars.  It's in the name of science, it's okay.  Take all your bars, break them up, then try them all.<br /><br />Yeah, that chocolate that keeps evolving and coating your mouth with subtlety and wizardry?  That's this one.

review/summary: If you have a respiratory issue its magic!!
review/text: I had a cough that was keeping me up night after night and not getting better. I had to sleep sitting up for 4 or 5 nights in a row. My friend swears by lotus root for the lungs and I am not so into homeopathic solutions, but she sent it to me. Within one day I slept through the night, but night 2 I was lying down and the cough was gone. I wasn't taking any other medication. There are no side effects at all. Try it, it doesn't taste awesome but if you add some soy sauce, sea salt or ginger it is better. And drink as much as you can, its food, so its not harmful. There are no directions as to how much to take. Some people make an entire pot out of the packet and then keep it in the fridge and re-heat it a cup at a time. I made a cup at a time and had about 6 cups the first 2 days then less each day. In less than a week I was 100% fine.

review/text: I was looking forward to getting this product. I loved the classic brulee, however the chocolate tasted like chocolate pudding with sugar on top. It had no special taste and it was expensive. I gave this a three star only because the classic is still very good for a boxed dessert. If you are looking for a bargain do not order from this store there is better pricing out there.

review/text: This coffee is simply superb. It strikes just the right balance between Arabica and Robusta, with a well-rounded, creamy, yet robust flavor. It's perfect for both moka coffee makers and espresso makers (I use it with both). This coffee is very popular in Naples and throughout Italy, and for very good reasons. To add to its value, it's also reasonably priced (as far as imported Italian coffee can be reasonably priced here in the US, anyway). If you're looking for the REAL Neapolitan coffee flavor, this is it. As they say in Italy, "Provare per credere" (trying is believing). Enjoy!

review/summary: A steal at $17 per case, easily used right out of the freezer
review/text: I buy Bob's Red Mill ground flax seed meal from Winco Foods grocery store for about $4 per pound and my kids love it--or at least they tolerate it.  We put it in pancake mix to add fiber and nutrients--start out with just a little bit until the kids get used to the different texture and then increase the amount gradually.  We always add a little whenever we bake, or make hot cereal.  But mostly just pancake mix.<br /><br />The packaging is very good, product is always fresh and nutty tasting.  Never bitter.  Should be refrigerated or kept in the freezer.  Lasts a very long time in the refrigerator, not sure how long (about 2-3 months before we finish it all).<br /><br />Whole flax seeds last much longer, even without refrigeration, but they must be finely ground before consumption to get the nutrients.

This was mailed in December but I guess the warm Georgia winter melted them in transit. For the price, I hoped that all of them would be intact. Taste was not compromised though. Yum!

review/summary: Yummers...and a good buy.
review/text: Actually, for what you are getting here (a little shot of heaven), this is not really a bad price.  I am quite familiar with this brand of pistachio and I have not found a better quality nut anywhere.  In the five pound bags I have bought in the past, I have found on the average only three nuts per bag (yes, I actually counted them...I have an obsessive/compulsive personality) that were scrawny and tasting bad.  The rest have been nice fresh and plump.<br /><br />These are salted but fortunately they have not been soaked in that horrid red dye that gets all over the place much as those cheese snacks do.  As a matter of fact, the only place I have had better pistachios has been when I visit Greece or Turkey.<br /><br />I have a passion for these things that boarders on an addiction.  These are the real thing and they certainly do it for me.  I highly recommend this company and their product.

review/text: Nuts are of above average quality, though strangely about 5% of the nuts have an almond taste to it. Better than most store bought brands. No real complaints.<br /><br />However, I have to put a low rating on this due to the price increase. I know this type of review note is frowned upon, but the nuts are not worth the money that they jacked the price up to. My total order one week ago was $34.48 shipped. Went I went to reorder, the price is now $50.90 including shipping. I do not understand the reason for the sudden price increase, but while the nuts are good, they are not worth this exorbitant price. At $10 a pound, you can find a better deal for pistachios on an equal or better level.

review/summary: Not a quality dog food
review/text: This dog food has all the ingredients you don't want in a dog food - corn, by-products, etc.  For about the same price, Diamond has their Naturals line that is MUCH BETTER in terms of quality.  Diamond Naturals Puppy food doesn't have corn or by-products.<br /><br />I honestly don't know why Diamond puts out this awful dog food when they can make quality ones for right about the same price - given the choice, who would take the one for less quality?<br /><br />Our puppy was on this when we got her, we bought a small bag and slowly changed her food to the Diamond Naturals for Large Breed puppies, and the difference is fantastic.  We'll stick with the Naturals, and never have her go back to this variety.

review/summary: Madame Poops-a-lot
review/text: I have a 7-month old terrier/german shep mix (a pound puppy, yes) who seems like she's going to end up around 50 or 60 pounds. I did a lot of research before I went with this brand - I can't afford the high-end food but don't want to settle for cheap stuff just cuz the price is right and this fell right in the middle. It came highly recommended and comes out to about a dollar a day for Betsy. She likes it and seems to be benefitting from it - her coat looks nice, her body is filling out in the right places but she's not fat at all. However, I have never seen a dog poop soooooo much! At first I thought it was just the change in her diet - from street food to good food - but she's been on it for almost 2 months now and it's not letting up. She's healthy, has had all her shots, is in great condition, and eats the right amount according to the chart on the bag. But wow! I was under the impression that the better the food the LESS they poop... not the case with this. At least 3 times a day, minimum, and lots of it. I can only attribute it to the food and will change it when this second bag is gone.

review/text: Finally a great alternative to the other "Dr" soda!  Dr. Zevia has an intense flavor with a lot of cherry in it.  Not quite as much "pepper" flavor as the mainstream brand.  There is a stevia aftertaste, but it's not any worse than an aspartame aftertaste.  I love it and feel good letting my kids drink it, too.

review/summary: No chemical sweeteners
review/text: I have been a fan of Zevia since they first came out a few years ago and before they could market themselves as a food product due to stevia's status at the time. Now that stevia is approved by the FDA as a food additive, many more things are coming out with it. I refuse to eat foods with chemical sweeteners like aspartame, sucralose and ace K that all of the major diet sodas use. I applaud Zevia for being ahead of the curve on choosing natural stevia instead. Dr. Zevia is my favorite flavor--I want caffeine in my soda, but don't like the flavor of the cola as much as Dr. Zevia, so I was extremely happy when they came out with this flavor. Truly a no-guilt treat!

With that being said, I must also say that I am a HUGE lover of everything Zevia and anything related. Every single Zevia product that I've tried, I've LOVED! That is until Dr. Zevia. I am an avid lover of anything cherry and anything Dr. Pepper related. I was so excited when my case of Dr Zevia arrived that I ran inside, opened the box and immediately opened one. This is when I gagged LOL! It is soooooooooo similar to robatussin that it's nauseating. I thought that maybe it would get better if it was super cold, no it actually got worse. I have 23 cans of Dr. Zevia that I have NO idea what to do with lol. It might be good in a milkshake or in some sort of food as a flavor enhancer but it definitely isn't a great soda.

I first tried them when I started doing lower carb eating and I have to admit that being someone who has never liked diet soda AT ALL, they took some getting used to.

The Dr. Zevia and the Black Cherry seem to be just sweet enough for me with the way I eat now. I'd like it if they came out with a creme soda flavor too.

review/summary: The Best Alternative to Diet Sodas With Artificial Sweeteners
review/text: Whenever I drink a soda at home, it is always a Zevia soda.  Dr. Zevia has a slight cherry flavor and is similar to the other Dr.  I have noticed very little aftertaste from Zevia soda, much less than from regular diet soda.  From the reviews I've read, it's clear that you either really like this soda or you don't.  I really like this soda.  I was a big consumer of the other diet Dr. and both big-brand diet colas for many years.  I really didn't like the artificial sweetener in the average diet soda.  Thank you to the people who make Zevia soda.  It is more expensive than regular soda, but I think it's worth it.  It is great to be able to enjoy a diet soda that tastes great and contains nothing artificial.  My only negative comment would be about what happens when you pour Zevia soda in a glass over ice.  The carbonation seems to dissipate very quickly when poured over ice.  Not to worry.  Drinking it right out of the can works fine for me.

review/text: I love Dr. Zevia. I've tried a few Zevia soda varieties, and this is my favorite. I also like the Root Beer. Many of the flavors taste distinctly diet, but Dr. Zevia tastes less diet to me. It does not, however, taste very much like Dr. Pepper at all. I find the flavor more like a cherry cola, which I like. If you're looking for a Dr. Pepper substitute, this might not be for you. If you're looking for a tasty, natural, 0-calorie soda, I recommend this. It is also significantly cheaper here than at my local grocery store.

review/text: This is Zevia's version of Dr. Pepper.  Does it taste EXACTLY like Dr. Pepper?  No, but when you pretty much stop drinking soda of all kinds, an occasional Dr. Zevia tastes pretty good.  Given it's a healthier alternative, I don't mind the sacrifice in taste.  Amazon has a really good price too (as of this review) compared to what I can buy it for locally in the health food stores/grocers.  I would recommend someone who is a Dr. Pepper or Mr. Pibb addict and interested in an alternative, healthier version to try this brand and flavor.

review/text: Because it has "Dr." in its name, you think you're getting a Dr. Pepper knockoff.  Instead, you get only the cherry flavor of Dr. Pepper.  So, in fact, it's more like Cherry Cola than anything else.  I couldn't taste any of the other major flavors that are in the real (diet) Dr. Pepper.  It's not bad, but I really don't like cherry cola, so it's not for me.

review/summary: Tastes great, perfect alternative.
review/text: I haven't had soda or carbonation in years. I got this for my parents who, to avoid sugar, drink nothing but aspartame filled fresca black cherry and peach. Figuring that is so much worse, I was so excited to find Zevia and currently am awaiting my parents to try the flavors. I myself grabbed a Dr. Zevia because I loved Dr. Pepper back when I used to drink soda. Now it has been years, so I cracked it open and noted a considerable spice and cherry smell. I took a sip and felt a punch to the throat like I downed some great tasting apple cider vinegar. That's not a problem with this product, it's just what happens when you haven't had carbonated drinks in years. It tastes just like Dr. Pepper, maybe a little bit like a diet but that's not a problem because it tastes great all the same AND you're not compromising your health. This is the benefit of capitalism, someone wants a better product, someone makes a better product. I want to get everyone I know on this stuff and off of their monsters, fresca's, diet pepsi's and so on...

review/text: it was ok.  Just ok.  Didn't love it, didn't hate it.  I went to drink it hoping for it to be just like dr pepper.  At first I felt like it was lacking in sweetness, but that was just because stevia lacks that mouthfeel of sugar.  I adjusted to the sweetness thing by the second gulp and that was ok.  It was actually pretty ok except for the lacking bite.  I got the stevia aftertaste (not too bad of one) where I was expecting bite.  Disappointing... not dismal... I got the variety pack... This was the first one I tried.  I'm likely to drink the other one... but its just not the same.  I actually looked back at the can a few times to convince myself it said Dr. Zevia and not Cola... It is passable as a cola (haven't tried the cola yet).  Hopefully the other flavors will be better.

It's a great alternative to High fructose corn syrup and artificial chemicals.

I recently discovered Zevia sodas (because of the Belly Fat Cure book/diet plan).

The Mountain Zevia tastes nothing like its nutrasweet counterpart (I thought it tasted much like the "Airborne" cold medicine).

It took about three cans before I was fully acclimated to the new (to me) taste of Stevia.<br />I also enjoy the Zevia cola, but this is my favorite flavor.

review/text: I purchased a case of this product in the hopes to find an alternative to the high calorie, high sugar beverage I normally drink.  Dr Pepper has been my favorite for years.  I have tried other beverages that were supposed to be cheaper versions of it, only to be disappointed every time.  I thought, with this version (Dr Zevia) being so much more expensive and using stevia to sweeten as a healthier alternative than sugar, that this would likely be closer to the brand name beverage it was trying to be like.  Unfortunately, I found it not only wasn't closer to the flavor, it was much worse than any I had tried in the past!  It was like drinking carbonated cough syrup!  I did not return it because my son decided to drink it and suffer through it to try to reduce his caloric intake, but if he wants more of it, he will have to buy it himself.  I will never again spend 4 times the amount I spend for the real deal, just to be disappointed by what is expected to be a high quality product.

And PCC had it on sale for $5.09 for a 6-pack so I lucked out.<br /><br />I'm a Dr. Pepper fan - my favorite soda but I won't drink it (except 1x a year) because they don't have a healthy version. I loved the taste of Dr Zevia but enough reviewers have had mixed reviews so definitely try it first before ordering quantities. I drank it ice-cold. The flavor is pretty dang close.<br /><br />The sweeteners used are stevia and erythritol. Stevia is definitely good for you and won't spike your insulin levels. (From the zevia.com website: "What is erythritol? Erythritol is a natural sweetener found in many fruits and vegetables. It is extracted from those sources by a natural fermentation process. The erythritol in ZEVIA exists in the same form - unchanged - as it does in plants and vegetables. Although erythritol is classified as a sugar alcohol, erythritol does not cause the gastrointestinal issues associated with other polyols like xylitotl, malitol, and sorbitol.") However I've heard that some people can still have digestive upsets with ANY sugar alcohol so suggest you test it carefully. I did OK with it.<br /><br />So glad I found Dr. Zevia - I won't be drinking much of it because I'll stick mostly to water and carbonated water (and add Sweetleaf Stevia like root beer, grape, orange and vanilla creme to make soda-like flavors) for the healthiest options. But love love Dr. Zevia for when I need my Dr. Pepper fix.

review/summary: Would give it minus stars if I could...disgusting ack ew!
review/text: I am from the south and grew up on Dr. Pepper. In wanting to break a near daily habit of 1-2 cans, I first switched to a cane sugar cola (to at least get off HFCS), then tried Dr. Zevia.<br />Honestly I nearly vomited when I took the first sip of this stuff.<br />The strongest taste is the clove, then a funky aftertaste that was just like cough syrup.<br />I tentatively tried another sip - I couldn't detect any cherry, only clove and cough syrup.<br />I tried a three more cans over a 1-month span (thinking maybe it was just the surprise of how NOT like Dr. Pepper it is), and same results.  Yuck.  Yuck.  Yuck.<br /><br />This doesn't taste anything remotely like Dr. Pepper, not even close, not even in the same universe.<br />If you are a die-hard regular Dr. Pepper fan, you will most likely detest this product as much as I do.<br />On the other hand, if you aren't looking for a DP sub, or are used to an aspartame drink, or like clove and cough syrup, then you might enjoy this product.

review/text: Hats off to Zevia for making this Dr Pepper like soda. If you've never had Stevia sweetened soda before, it is a bit artificial tasting and Zevia puts less "sweet" in their sodas. If you are looking for something that tastes just like sugar, you will be disappointed, but at least it's natural. The taste is fairly close to the real Dr Pepper. Give it a try.

review/text: While I enjoy the taste of Dr. Zevia for itself, the DH doesn't enjoy it at all.  (He was really hoping for something closer to the original.)  That and the fact that it is only available in cans is the reason that I'm giving it 3 stars.<br /><br />Neither of us thought that it has an unpleasant aftertaste, and it's not over-carbonated.  (Some sodas are so fizzy that it feels like you're drinking flavored foam.)  However, the reddish coloring stains like the blazes.  A few drops got on a light green table cloth, and even a stain stick didn't get it out.  Ugh.  Between the aluminum cans, the staining and the fact that I'm the only one who likes the taste, I probably won't be buying this often, if at all.

review/summary: Dr. Zevia
review/text: As a diabetic who likes soda, I mostly avoid sugary sodas.  Until a year ago, I drank the usual Aspartame-sweetened diet sodas; however, being analyzed by a naturopath and being told I was basically embalmed from the Aspartame (which turns to formaldehyde at 90 degrees), I had to quit ingesting Aspartame in any form.  The Dr. Zevia is a tasty substitute for the Dr. Pepper I used to drink.

review/text: I stopped drinking soda years ago, due to artificial everything (in regular and diet) and high fructose corn syrup (in regular).  I occasionally enjoyed an all natural soda that's sweetened with cane sugar, but it has too many calories to consume regularly.  Then I discovered Zevia.<br /><br />I first tried Dr. Zevia (although I'm not sure why, because I have HATED "Dr. Salt" since I was a kid).  LOVE IT!!  I still cannot believe that something this sweet and satisfying is zero calories.  Don't mind the caffeine boost to keep me going in the afternoon either.<br /><br />I also have tried Zevia Cola and Black Cherry, but Dr, Zevia is my absolute favorite.

review/summary: Big fan & great for my diabetic mom
review/text: I originally started buying Zevia a year ago for my diabetic mother - we actually did some glucose testing just after drinking a can and our glucose levels did not change so that was good to know. The flavors are good, especially Dr. Zevia. I recently was able to but the new flavors in Chicago (cream, grape and Mountain Zevia) - the grape was the best!<br /><br />Recently I switched our entire office to Zevia since I always felt bad buying sugared or chemicaled drinks for the company. At first a couple people were reluctant but now everyone is hooked.

I'm a big Dr. Pepper fan and Dr. Zevia isn't even close.  It was the worst of the 12 flavors I tried.  It tasted almost like a watered down cherry cough syrup and had a wicked aftertaste.

review/summary: Finally a "healthy" cereal with some TASTE!
review/text: I know that Kashi makes an assortment of "good for you" cereals but, quite frankly, I just can't bring myself to eat many of them regularly because they taste like tree bark IMO. And Kashi foods in general *are* healthy but not recommended for someone trying to lose weight due to high amounts of fat, calorie, and carbs. For a VERY long time I've been trying to fine a cereal that A) tastes good, B) is low-fat, and C) has a good ratio of carbs-to-fiber-to protein. TRUST ME - this is more difficult than you would imagine because usually the *really good-for-you* cereals (health-wise) taste terrible but Kashi's black currant & walnut cereal is a WINNER for me!!!!!  EVEN MY DOG likes the teeny little oat clusters - LOL!<br /><br />First of all - I LOOOOVE the currants! The sweetened flakes are a wonderful balance to the tart currants and the walnuts and oat clusters add a nice crunch. I add almond slivers and flax seeds to my bowl as well and my tastebuds are singing with each bite!<br /><br />I'm also very keen on reading ingredients' labels on packages and even though the list on this product initially struck me as long (which usually translates into lots of preservatives via words I can't pronounce), I was pleasantly surprised that the ingredients total about 90% actual food products (natural sweeteners, fruits, grains, etc.) 5% vitamins, and 5% preservatives. That's really good for a wonderful as it tastes  :-)<br /><br />So, all in all, even though I am working on shedding about 50 lbs and need to really watch my fat, calorie, and carb intake, I can eat the recommended serving size of this cereal (1 cup) and not feel like I'm sabotaging my weight loss efforts because I easily burn the 200 calories in my morning workout and the 7g fiber/5g protein/3.5g fat per serving (these numbers are slightly elevated b/c I add my own nuts) are all still "safe" numbers. Sometimes I will even eat the cereal as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack if I chose to eat something different for breakfast. It's THAT yummy!!!!<br /><br />The only snag I might run into is trying to FIND this cereal. Right now, I've been lucky to buy it at Grocery Outlet for only $2.99/box but these stores typically don't stock "specialty" cereals on a regular basis. They just get a shipment of something in and when it's gone, it's gone. GRRRR!! So I'm going to go buy whatever stock they have left of this cereal and hope I don't have to buy it through Amazon and pay shipping. Sounds like Costco has it though so I might have to break down and buy a membership - just for the cereal. LOL!

The combination of the tart black currants with the walnuts and crunchy high fiber flakes....I don't know....it's just so good. It's a shame it's more expensive than most cereals, but it's delicious, nutritious, and worth it. Be aware that this box is slightly smaller than most standard cereals. I try to eat mostly paleo/high protein, but I always keep this around to satisfy my carb/sweet cravings. It's healthier than most options and it's delicious. Delivery was great and the expiration dates were 6+ months out.

review/summary: Best cereal ever
review/text: I've been looking for a cereal like this for many years. It tastes great, stays crunchy in milk, and has just the right amounts of fruits(currents) and walnuts. In my opinion when a cereal shows walnuts on the box or lists them on the box, like many do, they should 'have walnuts' in the cereal. This one does and plenty of them. For the price ( walmart has it for $3.50 per box in my area) it has all the nuts you will want unless you just want nuts and no cereal. You don't need to "look" for the nuts to find them. It has taste, crunch, protein, fiber, the nuts provide omega 3s , and all this in a natural cereal that is economical as well. Kashi has many cereals that are good for you , but I was surprised to find this one is so good I probably eat too much of it .  The only thing which isn't top quality with this cereal is the box which is made of re-cycled cardboard. You can enjoy it and know you are helping the environment at the same time.<br />PS: Amazon will undoubtely edit the name of the store I said had this for $3.50 per box in my area. It has "mart" in the name and it is written on the "wall" of the store. Wonder if they'll edit this too ??

review/text: This cereal is so tasty and a nice break from the traditional flake stuff. It has a subtle berry flavor (but not a mock flavor one you get tired of), nice walnut pieces, and very balanced in the sweet/tart factor. It feels very hearty, balanced and filling, on top of being delicious. Does not feel bland or overly sugary. I love that the fruit in this is not another raisin filled box - currants and acai berries, tart and yummy, doesn't stick to your teeth. And NO high fructose corn syrup. This is by far my favorite cereal. I'll even grab handfuls as snacks. So glad I tried this. Whoever dreamed this up hit their target market right on, and I am eagerly anticipating other interesting flavors like this one down the road.

review/summary: Tart, crunchy, and satisfying
review/text: I've always been a fan of whole grain bread, but I've had problems in the past with finding a decent whole grain cereal.  Whole grains don't need to be boring, bland, dry, or like cardboard, and Kashi has a knack for proving this.  I've tried many, many Kashi products and am consistently pleased with this one.<br /><br />This particular cereal has an interesting and satisfying mix of tastes and textures.  The currants have a nice snap to them when you bite into them, and they are very tart.  I happen to adore black currant, but I can see how the taste might prove a bit too tart for some.  If you're expecting a sweet cereal, you should probably keep looking.<br /><br />There are some nice, sizable chunks of walnuts mixed into the cereal, and they provide extra crunch and a nice nutty flavor, which contrasts well with the mild sweetness of the flakes.<br /><br />On the cautionary side, this cereal packs a considerable number of calories in a pretty small quantity.  While it is certainly healthier than most of the junk you'll find in the grocery store cereal aisle, it is still worth noting that, if you don't pour carefully, you could end up with a breakfast of a hefty number of calories.<br /><br />I've checked the price of this cereal at a couple of different local stores, and it is considerably cheaper for to order it via Amazon.  I think the subscribe & save price is pretty much unbeatable.

review/summary: Incredibly tasty cereal.
review/text: I've tried so many whole grain cereals, I can't remember them all...to be honest many are best forgotten. Kashi U is easily the best of Kashi's many variants (and I really like several of Kashi's offerings). It is an interesting mixture of textures, but the black currants are the magic ingredient. The cool sweetness they bring to the party makes this a cereal standout. Add a little bit of Silk Light Vanilla soy milk and you are in breakfast bliss.

review/summary: The very best cold cereal you can buy
review/text: This has to be the best researched and best constructed cereal ever produced for the mass market. As other reviewers have said, all aspects of human health were addressed, it is very tasty with great textures. Ever since I bought my first box, the only time since then I ever buy other cereals is when U is not available. Even the box and the ink are cutting edge as far as environmental concerns. I feel good for hours after eating it, and heartily recommend it with Tempt original hemp milk for that much extra omega 3 and 6 (it tastes great with moo milk as well). The retail price when not on sale is about $4.99/box- expensive, but worth it. the bulk price is much better, and if you buy enough to get free shipping, it's a great deal.  Since U is such a wonderful product, you may not want to eat any other cereals, in which case a 4 pack will only last a couple of weeks...

review/summary: Kashi U Cereal
review/text: I am not a fan of kashi cereal as most taste like cardboard to me.  I love this cereal.  It tastes good, doesn't get soggy in milk.  I even eat it as a snack.  Very crunchy so quickly satisfies!  Received timely.  The boxes were not bent or crushed in any way.
