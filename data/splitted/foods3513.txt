review/summary: Loved it!
review/text: This tea has quickly climbed to one of my favorites. I love how the immediate creamy coconut fragrance is balanced by the later slightly bitter note of tea. The white tea is so young that I feel like I can taste the freshness of the leaves, and again, the white tea couldn't be more perfect to balance the creaminess of the coconut. I will definitely keep buying this brand!

review/summary: Fine Chai Spice Tea---Without the Caffeine!
review/text: ****<br />This is a decaffienated version of Stash's chai spice tea, made from blended black teas, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and natural flavors of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Many chai spice teas (which I drink plain without milk or additional sweetener) nauseate me, but this one did not---I loved it! The numerous spices are a unique taste sensation, and enjoyable cup of tea. I brewed the tea as I always do, leaving the tea bag in far beyond the 3-5 minutes recommended brewing time, and the tea never turned bitter, just got stronger and tastier! Tastes exactly like the caffeinated version, but you can drink cup after cup because there is no caffeine!<br />****

review/text: The date on the lid of the Maranatha Dark Chocolate Peanut Spread I purchased is Sept 23 2012.  I purchased this item from my local grocery store on June 15 2012.  The product is separated and very thin on top with really thick hard to stir chunks throughout the rest of the jar.  The texture is gritty.  Just awful.  I always but this brand of organic peanut butter and it's fantastic, but this stuff is not edible.

review/summary: peanut butter + chocolate = yum
review/text: I've tried MaraNatha's peanut butter and almond butters with mixed satisfaction.  After trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005TY2UGO">Maranatha Dark Chocolate Almond Spread (3x13 OZ)</a> and enjoying it, I wanted to see if MaraNatha made other chocolate spreads and was happy to come upon this one.  MaraNatha has made another great spread by incorporating chocolate with peanuts. The product is smooth and delicious and belongs in the chocolate lover's pantry.  Because it is relatively comparable to the calorie count of peanut butter, it may be a way to liven up some toast or other food where peanut butter might be used.<br /><br />The dark chocolate peanut spread is easily removed from the container and no stirring is required. This product tastes great on toast, banana pieces, mixed with ice cream or oatmeal or straight out of the jar (my personal favorite). It is smooth enough to be used as a cake or cupcake icing, which is something I have used the MaraNatha dark chocolate almond spread for.<br /><br />There is no indication on the jar that the product must be refrigerated. I typically refrigerate my peanut butters and other nut butters so I did that with this product and it did make the product more stiff. If you wanted to use this as a frosting, you would need to heat it slightly after refrigeration.<br /><br />Many peanut butters have about 180 - 190 calories per tablespoon serving.  A serving of the dark chocolate peanut spread is 2 tablespoons and has 180 calories, 13 grams of fat (2 grams saturated), 1 grams of dietary fiber, 8 grams of sugar and 5 grams of protein. The product's ingredients include: dry roasted peanuts, evaporated can juice, palm oil, canola oil, cocoa powder, non-fat dry milk, canola oil, soy lecithin, natural vanilla flavor and salt.<br /><br />While the product is vegetarian, it is not vegan due to the milk content and those sensitive to soy should avoid this product. If you are a vegan and/or desire something that is a little lighter in terms of sugar content, I would recommend <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046GRD0O">Artisana Coconut Butter-Cacao Bliss (100% Organic),8-Ounce</a> , which is a coconut butter that, when warmed, is very smooth and flavorful.<br /><br />For holiday and birthday gifts, I often pair some of my favorite teas or spreads in baskets. For a gift basket, I think this product would be great paired with some high end chocolate products like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DIVOCS">Scharffen Berger Milk Almond Sea Salt, 3-ounces (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>.  This product will definitely be on my short list to give to other chocolate lovers.<br /><br />I purchase MaraNatha dark chocolate almond spread at my local co-op for about 4.50 a jar.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States.

review/summary: My #1 favorite!
review/text: Let me start this review by saying I'm a bit of an expert on hot sauce.  Maybe not as much as Scott Roberts (of scottrobertsweb.com) but fairly close. I use hot sauce all the time.  I've tried hundreds of brands.  And this is easily in my top 5 hot sauces ever and probably my #1!<br /><br />First, it's hot.  It's not so ungodly hot that I can't run a solid line down my burrito, but it's hot enough where even the most hardcore of chileheads can tell it's hot.  It's hot enough to get the job done.  And it's a perfect heat where I can use it with anything.  It is one of the hotter non-extract based sauces out there (which means it should have good flavor -- those who don't know, most extract sauces taste a little chemically and thus lack in flavor).<br /><br />Second, there's flavor which is the most important category.  After all, who wants to eat something that's hot, but doesn't particularly taste good? And flavor is where this sauce excels.  This is a Louisiana style hot sauce with a vinegary base, but the flavor is much more complex than any other Louisiana style hot sauce I have ever had.  While there is a bitter vinegery taste that we have come to associate to Louisiana style hot sauce, there is a sweet fruity flavor at the same time.  It works as a Louisiana style hot sauce, and also with dishes that one normally wouldn't associate with a Louisiana style hot sauce.  In short, this sauce is good with anything which makes it the most versatile hot sauce of its style.<br /><br />Third, they all have some cool artwork on the bottles.<br /><br />In short, if you enjoy spicy foods, you really can't go wrong with this hot sauce or anything Heartbreaking Dawns really.

Strong flavour, enough to be drinked with a few drops of milk or lime juice if you like. The price is of course higher than in britain, but I rather not travel to London every time I need another bag. Make sure you like this tea first, a cup in your local coffee shop maybe, since amazon will sell you 6 bags on every order.

review/summary: Tetley Tea Bags
review/text: I have been drinking black English tea since I was a small child, when Bella, our Scottish maid used to fix it for us kids with liberal amounts of milk and sugar.  Several years ago, when I was in London with my granddaughter, we stayed for two weeks in a small studio flat near Hyde Park.  When we arrived, the kitchen was equipped with a few foodstuffs to get us started.  This Tetley Tea, with it's round tea bags in the little blue rectangular bag, was the first thing we used.  Both my granddaughter and I were struck with its fragrance and robust flavor.  Since then I have been ordering it on Amazon.  The tea comes from England and is better than anything you can buy in the States and is reasonably priced.  I still drink it every morning -- hot, with a dash of half and half, and a small amount of Stevia sweetener.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: If you are new to the Numi Flowering Tea, it is a must try. Unlike one of the previous reviewer, I find the tea to have plenty of flavor the first three pots before fading in taste and aroma in the subsequent pots. The blooming flower, the aroma, and the smoothness of the tea really gives a relaxing feel and is wonderful to have after a long day. I typically add 2 sugar cubes along with a bit of milk in every cup and it really enhances the taste. I highly recommend this tea.<br /><br />The main objective of this review is to let prospective buyers know just what pedals are included inside since the product description fails to list them. The following is what you will find in the box.<br /><br />Jade Fortune x 2<br />Starlight Rose x 1<br />Golden Jasmine x 1<br />Black Beauty x 1<br />Midnight Peony x 1<br /><br />The flavors listed above isn't the best from Numi, but this box seems to be a bit more reasonable in price as well. Give it a try and judge for yourself ;)

Nothing about that review is accurate beyond what exactly you're getting in the box. The tea itself has virtually no flavor but it does have the aroma of flowers. (Think of that bar of decorative soap you saw sitting on the table at that garage sale)The "blossom" itself is rather kelp-like. It looks like a floating mass of sea weed with bits crumbling off. You'll find yourself pulling bits stiff colored leaves out of your mouth throughout the cup. I'm drinking a cup as I write this. I'll sum it up in a few words;<br /><br />Taste: Hot water (Added quarter table spoon of honey, I taste a lot of that now)<br />Aroma: Decorative Grandma soap no one would buy for a quarter<br />Visual: Amorphous green mass<br /><br />If you bought this as a gift, prepare to disappoint your loved one.

review/summary: These Chips Make You Fart!
review/text: Over $11 a bag?  Are you crazy?  I must admit that these are some of the best chips I have EVER eaten, but eleven bucks?  If you have not tried these chips or the other flavor from the Artisan line, you really should give them a try.  They first showed up at my local Costco in huge bags but are now showing up in smaller grocery stores.  They're stamped with $3.99/bag from the vendor.  I think what makes these chips unique, aside from their great taste, is the fact that they have dried pinto beans in their recipe (right in the chip...not a powder flavoring).  I couldn't believe it the first time I ate them.  I got gas and couldn't remember eating anything that would have affected me that way.  It must have been the chips.  It was pretty easy to verify.  These suckers are worth every puff of methane.  Give them a try.  Your partner might be disappointed, but you won't.<br /><br />UPDATE (06SEP11): WHOA NELLY! I made nachos out of these things just last weekend.  WOW.  I simply shredded mild cheddar cheese (with my salad shooter), and put it on a layer of chips that I had placed on a foil-covered cookie sheet.  I topped it with pickled Serrano peppers and diced chili peppers (ingredients were sparse last weekend) and it was wonderful.  Typically, I would add jalapenos and olives but they were not on-hand.  What a unique eating experience.  I do oven nachos often but usually just use regular tortilla chips.  This was different and very tasty.  Give it a try.

review/summary: Tangy, Spicy, Delicious... Discontinued?
review/text: We were on one of those exhausting road trips, the kind where the map is wrong, the air conditioning is busted and you're too far from home to make turning around feasible.  We'd stopped at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and I'd bought a couple of caffeinated sodas and a big bag of these Blazin' Buffalo & Ranch Doritos.  It might say more about my trip than these chips, but they were hands down the best part of that horrible "vacation."<br /><br />They were spicy, but not truly hot, with the right blend of heat and tanginess that good buffalo wings have, and a little lingering ranch flavor at the end.  They're sort of a cross between Spicy Nacho and Ranch, but with a little more kick. It took two crunches to proclaim these "my new favorite flavor!"<br /><br />But, aside from that single bag, I haven't seen these ANYWHERE!  I can't justify the current price on these (about 10 -12 times what I'd pay at a local supermarket!) despite their rarity, and there's no way I'll be trekking back to that gas station anytime in the future, but in the off chance you find a bag somewhere, give 'em a try.

I love giving thought to holiday gift giving.  I can honestly say this is the first time I've given wieners as a gift.  LOL!

review/summary: Sweet Strawberry
review/text: Matcha where have you been all my life! I mentioned in another review of Red Leaf Tea's Matcha tea that my discovery of tea is a very new adventure for me and that after reading rave reviews on Steepster about Red Leaf's eclectic selection of flavors, I gave it a try. I wonder now how I got along without it. I got my daughter hooked and recently had my son try it. He immediately ordered some for himself. After tasting it, it is not a question of "do I want to order some", it is more like "how much and what flavors should I order"! Trust when you look at all the flavors they have to offer, it is extremely hard to decide!<br />My second order came last week and I could smell the wonderful matcha before I opened the box! First up for testing was the Strawberry flavored match.<br />Sweet and naturally tasting Strawberry flavor. In an effort to lead a healthier lifestyle, I find Matcha tea to be so versatile. I added a teaspoon of Matcha, a half a cup of plain greek yogurt & a few fresh strawberries, a little almond milk & ice in a blender and I had a delicious healthy smoothie!

review/summary: Deliciously strawberry!
review/text: Out of the gold foil package, the matcha smells like juicy strawberry, like smelling strawberry fruit leather or a strawberry flavored candy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional cup of hot matcha, 1/4tsp of sifted strawberry matcha whisked in some 175f filtered hot water,  the green tea comes out as deliciously earthy with no bitterness. The strawberry is bright and present, adding a hint of sweetness. The taste combined almost reminds me on when I eat strawberries too fast and I accidentally eat the stem or a leaf, which happens often haha!<br /><br />Now my favorite part, making this matcha into an iced strawberry soy latte! I did about � or 2/3 cup of light soy milk (ran out of milk), bit of sweetener, 1/4tsp of matcha and whisked it. The result: very tasty strawberry balanced with the taste of matcha. Even better than strawberry soy milk as it tastes just like strawberry candy. An amazing treat for under 90 calories!<br /><br />Overall, very delicious if you are into the strawberry candy flavor. As a traditional cup it is pretty good, but even better as a latte. I suggest not to pass this one up.

review/summary: Pure summer bliss!
review/text: Let's get to the good stuff: as always, I fall in love with the first sniff. Cutting open the corner of the gold foil bag was like a flavour overload! The sweet strawberry scent was too good to be true - and happily for me, it tasted just like it smelled!!!<br /><br />That can be rare in a tea, but I've come to learn that Red Leaf Tea sets their bar just as high as I set mine! That leaves me very rarely disappointed, and almost always happily surprised with the quality, scent and flavour! Strawberry was no exception!<br /><br />(Excuse the amount of exclamation marks, I really can't help it)<br /><br />I ordered by my usual parameters: Basic Grade Matcha with Delicate flavouring. One day I will invest in tins, but right now I have a system that keeps my matcha fresh - a mix of the tiny tins from DavidsTea (from their "Wall" teas), and freezer bags kept in a special tin box. It's pretty and I like it! I kind of thrive in a world of controlled chaos - it's either the artist in me, or the lazy in me! Probably both - but I thought I should share my "technique" since the tins are a hot topic these days!<br /><br />On to the taste! I truly was taken by surprise. The flavour is simple but so effective that from this experience, I can't think of a better combination than matcha and strawberries. That's not to say that RLT has amazing flavour combos and super unique matchas - there is something just so simple, comforting and naturally delicious about this Strawberry Matcha. It's tangy and sweet - I prepared it first straight up with a bit of sugar, second as an iced matcha latte. The flavour was a mix between strawberry milk (I used to devour the stuff as a kid) and a melted strawberry milkshake!<br /><br />This inspires me to get some good quality vanilla ice cream and whip it up in my blender with this matcha! I looove matcha icecream and strawberry icecream, so I can't think of a better combo for a homemade matcha shake!

review/text: You know this matcha screams summer and while I have been longing for autumn to get here for the weather this mix makes me feel like going down the street to our local fruit farm and grabbing up a bunch of fresh strawberries! Yes I am lucky to have fruit farms close to my home. The grassy matcha base along with the fresh fruity aroma of strawberries just makes me sit back and appreciate summer a little while longer. This would be SO GOOD mixed with some orange juice in a smoothie. This makes me want to just play around with this flavor and see what all I can come up with! I bet an actual cheesecake made with this matcha would be sinfully divine!

review/text: I love this matcha. I could rave on and on about the multitude of ways it can be served and the multitude of health benefits it offers. First, I tried it in cold water. Delicious. There's a real freshness from the matcha and a strong strawberry aroma and flavor. It tastes like a strawberry juice. Next, strawberry matcha in cold almond milk. Mmmm. This was excellent. It really brought out the strawberry milk flavour I've adored for as long as I've been aware of its existence. Really tastes like a strawberry dessert. Love it! Then, I decided to try it in hot water. It's still great! It seems a bit strange to drink what tastes essentially like hot strawberry juice and like it, but I deceive you not, my palate found it quite appealing. And finally, in hot almond milk? Mmmm. Very comforting. Warm strawberry milk.

review/summary: Deliciously Strawberry!
review/text: I absolutely love this flavored Matcha.  Why?  Well, first, I love Matcha:  the bittersweet, creamy, vegetative taste with a hint of buttery goodness and all of its delightful nuances.  Second, I love strawberries!<br /><br />This flavored Matcha is a brilliant representation of both strawberries and of Matcha.  Creamy, smooth Matcha with sweet, juicy strawberry taste.  Together, it is a chawan full of berry goodness.  The strawberry is very true to the fruit:  sweet with just a hint of tartness toward the end, all that's missing is the seeds (and I don't really miss those!)<br /><br />A real treat, any time of day.  It's also great as a Matcha Milkshake.  Add some milk and ice cubes to the blender, along with a tablespoon or so of the Matcha (I really just eyeball everything), and blend until smooth.  It's really yummy, cool and refreshing.

review/summary: Strawberry Matcha Forever!
review/text: Mmmm strawberries. I cannot begin to tell you how much of my life has been spent picking strawberries. As a child, I hated it, but now I remember it fondly...isn't it weird how that happens? So good...strawberry shortcake is the most delicious thing in this world. Especially made with fresh, sun ripened strawberries. As long as I can remember, my mom has had a row or two of strawberries in her yard. When we lived in Michigan and we had room to garden (and soil that was more than just clay), we had tons of strawberries. Tons! But then we moved to Tennessee, and the soil there was not as habitable, but she still managed to squeeze some delicious berries out of that red clay. So strawberries and strawberry flavored things that actually taste like strawberries always remind me of her and of that gorgeous garden she kept in Michigan. Of course, they also remind me of the time I was about 7 and picking strawberries in the garden when I felt some grass brush over my foot. I looked down to see a snake slithering over my foot. **shudders** I have never screamed so loud in my life. And thus a lifelong fear of snakes was born.<br /><br />So the real question here is will this matcha be a snake or a shortcake?<br /><br />Shortcake. Oh my goodness, shortcake. This smelled amazing when I opened the package, like creamy, sweet strawberries. Like, well, strawberry shortcake, to be honest. Guh, I just want to dive into it. I took it to work with me and my mind was blown by it. I kept getting distracted by how good it was. I love a good tea. I'm trying to figure out which six I want to keep in stock and this is a definite front runner. I think mixing this with a little French Vanilla would be out of this world. I love berries so most of my smoothies are berry smoothies...this will be an amazing addition to that particular mix. Now, it doesn't have that hint of tartness that fresh strawberries do, but that's okay. I'm in love anyway. It tastes like strawberry candy, but I know Red Leaf Tea doesn't use artificial ingredients, so I'm very excited to have this. Next time I'm craving a bag of strawberry puffs, I'm going to reach for this instead. Mmmm...maybe I'll take some of this to work with me today too!

They have a great taste and there is alot of it to go around.  That said I guess I'm just not a fan of beef sticks.  The flavor didn't have me saying wow that's awesome like some jerkys do and the flavor got old for me.  It also gave me some crazy gas.  In summary this is a great product for anyone who even remotely likes beef sticks and doesn't have the same digestive problems as me or can stand the gas.

review/text: Upon receiving it from the "General Store" listed here on Amazon for about $21, I discovered it was expired two months ago but after researching a bit, I found that beef jerky lasts a lot longer than the expiration date. I contacted the online store and they refunded the full amount. I also discovered that there was only 5 packs instead of 6. Upon opening the pouch and trying some I found that they are too soft, like hot dogs. If you eat it right after opening the pouch it will seem soft, but if you leave it out for it to dry it then it actually has a bite-teary taste to it. I'd have to give it 2 stars, I docked a star for the expiration, the softness, and the missing pack.

The gums stay sore after using this mixture on them for about a week to a month but then they heal completely.  It takes daily use to get the gums to heal but they eventually do.<br /><br />Others have said mustard oil stinks.  I washed my hair and put some in my hair as usual and a co-worker said "you smell good."  We couldn't figureo out what it was but the only smell on me was the mustard oil.<br /><br />Finally, I don't know if this is true or not, but I think my hair is growing quicker; I put a permanent dye on my hair two weeks ago and now I have to put some more on it; dye normally doesn't grow out in two weeks on ethnic hair.<br /><br />What I like about the oil, even if the rest is the placebo effect, is that on ethnic hair, the oil absorbs in about a day and your hair doesn't feel oily but it is indeed moisturized.

This month, the company substituted some ugly crumbly mini key lime cookies by mistake. Amazon was nice enough to replace the order without asking me to ship them back, which would have cost me money. Today I received the ugly little crumbly version rather than the cookies in the striped box. Is this an actual mix up or is Traverse Bay counting on the buyer's fondness for the flavor.  The little cookies are not the same texture or flavor as the originals. They are sour. Yuck.

review/text: Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about "bowel tolerance" or "happy bowels" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.  I realize that taste is a personal thing.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: When i first stumbled across the Triple Tea leaf brand, i noticed that they did not use a metal staple to fasten the tea bag to the draw-string. Considering there are many different tea brands on the market, claiming a myriad of health benefits coming from their products, all claiming to be 100 percent natural etc...it seemed slightly contradictory to have a piece of metal floating in boiling hot water seconds before it is going to be consumed yet at the same time claiming to be healthy. At this day and age I am aware that it is 100 percent unavoidable to avoid contact with the more toxic elements in our world. But when it comes down to tea, i feel like it should naturally be one of those products that is by its genome, handled and packaged with care. I like to steep my green tea without a piece of metal in the equation. Maybe to some people I may be coming off as over reacting, and maybe I am, but when it comes down to it, wouldnt you rather support a company that goes out of their way to make their product that much better by simply keeping a peice of metal out of the tea you plan to drink? Its up to you to decide, not me. Overall great product and as of thus far, my favorite tea brand. And just for the record, this laxative works as it says it does. It may not feel comfortable pushing everything out, but no pain no gain right?

Also, it recommends that you don't take it for more than a week straight.  I don't know why but I listened to the instructions.  This isn't a long term solution if you're on meds that stop you up.  Then you have no choice but to work on a more natural solution like dried fruit or pears.  Good luck!

review/summary: This stuff works!
review/text: Bought this for my mom as an alternative to Milk of Magnesia and other liquid laxatives. She's a stroke victim so her physical activity has slowed down decreasing her metabolism. As directed and giving her one cup to drink before bedtime, she was able to have a bowel movement the next morning. The only complaint she had was minor stomach pain and loss of sleep since the tea was doing its thing overnight, but once she passed, everything was fine. This tea is even more effective if you drink two. Another method to avoid sleepless nights is to drink it first thing in the morning and you'll be sure to pass within 6-8 hours. Great product if you want to go regularly.

It doesn't separate or harden even in the fridge. It doesn't whip up like heavy cream.

review/summary: Product has slid downhill. Inconsistent in quality.
review/text: I've purchased about 5 cans per month of this for about 14 months. At first, this was a wonderful product.<br /><br />Later, I started finding the bad can occasionally - where the taste was akin to either the product having a metallic reaction with the can, or the product tasting like it had gone bad. But it didn't happen often enough to make me quit buying it.<br /><br />In the last few months, I've purchased more bad cans than good ones. I've written to their company, and called, numerous times. They don't seem too interested in my findings, sadly.<br /><br />Just now, I read another reviewer's comments stating that Thai Kitchen was bought out about a year ago. That seems to coincide with when my dis-satisfaction with the product began. Not only is the taste often bad; but formerly there would be a nice thick lump of cream at the top of the can, and a bunch of thin watery milk at the bottom - as one would want.  Now, however, the product is as thin as coffee creamer all the way through. It never thickens upon refrigeration, either. Clearly, there is NOT as much fat in the product as formerly. So disappointing!<br /><br />I wanted a product without sodium metabisulfate - which is a huge allergy trigger. The other recommended brands like Chao Koh have the sodium metabisulfate. Thai Kitchen does add guar gum, but I can live with that. If only they could keep their quality consistently good!<br /><br />I'm testing A Taste of Thai presently, which is more coconutty tasting, but is very thin and I'm not sure if I like the taste yet (there is an extra fruitiness that I can't quite identify and it is a little overpowering.)<br /><br />It shouldn't be this hard to get a good prepared coconut milk!

review/summary: NOT the REAL thing!!
review/text: In my culture we cook with coconut milk all the time. Usually I use chaokoh brand but I was at whole foods and happened to buy thai kitchen brand organic coconut milk. Why they even make organic coconut milk I will never know. The husk and shell on a coconut are thick enough to protect the nut from pesticides. though I don't know about commercial coconut growing I do know that coconut palms grow everywhere around my family's home and there's no need for pesticides; the nuts are protected by nature. Anyways, I'm glad I didn't buy a whole case of the stuff. I tasted it before I added it to the eggplant dish I was making and it was gross and watery. Real coconut milk, like chaokoh, has the slightest sweetness to it and is thick, creamy and separated. I was in a pinch so I went ahead and used it, but I feel my dish would have been better if I used my usual brand.

review/text: Recently, I tried coconut milk in my coffee because I had some left after cooking curry.  I drink 2 cups of coffee every morning, with cream - no sugar.  Even though it sounds awful - the coconut milk was fantastic!  So far I have tried two brands - the first was sweet, which I did not prefer - seeing as I do not sweeten my coffee.  The second was Thai Kitchen, ORGANIC, unsweetened.  The Thai Kitchen brand was MUCH better. It was thicker, and less sweet, very pleasant - creamy.  I didn't see the Organic Thai Kitchen, so I just bought a case of the regular, unsweetened Coconut milk.  I can't WAIT till it comes in! I know this is great in cooking, but seriously - when you have a recipe that does not call for the whole can, what do you do with the rest?

review/text: This is definitely the best coconut milk I can find.  I especially like the organic version.  The other brand referred to in these reviews is chemically altered. They add water and preserve it with sulfites - toxic and I'm allergic to them.  Also, when you buy a 'lite' version of coconut milk, you are just paying for the company to water it down for you.  You can add your own water at home if you don't like as much fat.  But this is healthy fat (which can help you lose weight-study Dr. Young's New Biology) and coconuts are so good for you, especially the green/young ones.

review/text: I've never purchased this from Amazon (it's cheaper at my local store). So this review is solely about the product.<br /><br />I have been using this coconut milk for almost a year.<br /><br />I think it's creamy, tasty, doesn't contain any added crud except guar gum which is used as a stabilizer.<br /><br />I chill the can in my fridge so the cream separates from the water. Then I scoop out the cream into a jar and use the cream in my coffee. I sometimes whip the cream with cinnamon and/or vanilla for extra flavour too!<br /><br />Alternately, if you shake the can really well, then transfer to a jar and refrigerate, the cream doesn't totally seperate and you're left with a very creamy product.<br /><br />Perhaps people complaining this product is watered down/separating are not giving their cans adequate "rest" time after being delivered and then chilling? I imagine they get pretty shaken up during transport from Amazon to your home?<br /><br />Anyways, I'd give this product a 5 if the can was BPA free and they ditched the guar gum (like natural valley brand).

review/summary: Very Good and No Preservatives...
review/text: I don't know why some people don't like this brand of coconut milk.  We like it.  While it is not organic, we wish it were, and it does have guar gum (which is a food derived, natural ingredient), it DOES NOT have chemicals/preservatives, which are bad for you.  It is thick and creamy, when slightly warmed, has a medium strength coconut flavor and tastes better than the brands with added preservatives.  (We've tried a lot of them!)  The ingredients are coconut milk, water, guar gum---that's it!  I DO wish it said what percentage of coconut milk was in the can, some brands do, but other than that, we are happy with this brand.  It has an expiration date printed on the bottom (we like that), some brands don't.  The price is more than the brands with preservatives, which I don't understand, I wish it were lower, but if we want food with no preservatives/added chemicals, I guess this is what our option is.  Hopefully, the price will come down.  What we don't like is the shipping--4 out of 12 cans in the case were severely or moderately dented, which means we had to use them soon or immediately (not happy at all about that).  We will order this brand again!

While Thai Kitchen Coconut Milk (full fat), right out of the can, is a great tasting substitute for cow's milk, I use it to make Kefir (a cultured drink similar to yogurt).  Another way to enjoy the milk is as-is, or the kefir, over fresh fruit! Delicious!!  Pour it on your cereal, use it in your baking, pour it in your hot tea or coffee...uses limited only to your imagination! I've tried other brands, but I found Thai Kitchen to be the nicest consistency @ a very good price.

review/text: I never thought there was any difference between brands when it came for coconut milk, so I would always go for the cheapest option; usually Goya. It wasn't until the grocery store was out of Goya one day and I had no other option but to try Thai Kitchen did my misconception become startlingly clear. This coconut milk so perfectly smooth and creamy, whereas cheaper brands tend to be a bit lumpier.  Additionally, by some miracle, it has none of the harsh aftertaste that plagues so many coconut products. It's just pure coconut essence, subtly but naturally sweet.  Now it's the only kind I'll buy! It's a bit of a splurge in comparison to budget or store brands, but it's entirely worth it. It will enhance your cooking like nothing else!

This is the only brand I can find with no preservatives. it does have a thickener so I docked it a star.<br />But this is great for soups, ice creams, curries, soups, stir fries, smoothies and so much more!<br />I've blogged many recipes using coconut milk this ones a keeper

review/summary: not "pure" coconut milk
review/text: Includes guar gum, which in large enough amounts is a bulk forming laxative. So this is not really "pure". Not everyone can tolerate guar gum. The taste is fine, I've never found chunks in my cans. It usually does separate, no big deal to me and I can eat it in small amounts in cooking but can't have a whole paleo smoothie from it. ymmv.

review/text: I crush this c-milk by the can.... so delicious. And no funky preservatives like you get from Goya and others. The only better deal is buying in bulk from Wholefoods. But this is pretty good stuff

review/summary: Great Coconut Milk
review/text: This is my favorite coconut milk, I use it in everything from thai curries to ice cream. I've been buying this brand for years, and while I've tried several different brands of coconut milk, this one has remained the best pick in both taste and price.<br /><br />Some reviewers complained that this isn't authentic coconut milk because it didn't stay separate in the can. I don't know what they are talking about - every one of the twelve cans I opened had the solid coconut cream on the top and the liquid on the bottom. None of my cans were bent, though a couple had dents in them. One reviewer did have a point about expiration dates - every can expired about a month after the purchase date. So when it got close to the expiration date, I made a batch of coconut ice cream.

review/summary: Yummy
review/text: Thai Coconut Milk is a great addition to smoothies ... adds a bit of sweetness and creamy  texture. Not only does Amazon have the best price, but being an Amazon Prime member makes the shipping free, and this case of 12 is HEAVY ... can't imagine what the shipping would cost otherwise!!! You will really enjoy this all natural product!!!

review/summary: Great Product Gone Bad
review/text: I used to be a big fan of Thai Kitchen's coconut milk and green curry paste. Now the coconut milk is thinner in consistency and flavorless and the curry paste has lost all its fire. Bummer, as it's hard to find quality products (of any kind) these days. Interesting note?--Thai Kitchen was recently acquired by another, larger company. Looks like the "recipes" have changed. As will mine.

review/summary: not as creamy as I'm used to.
review/text: I'd agree that the chaokoh brand has a much better product.  I had heard good things about this brand and bought a whole case...bummer.  I'm used to a thick and creamy white coconut milk with 17g of fat per serving.  This has only 10g of fat and is watered down looking.

review/text: It is a good deal however this is not my favorite coconut milk. It lacks the sweetness and it is more like dissolved flour. Still it makes an OK Thai dish.

review/summary: Wonderful product, yummy
review/text: Luckily this is available locally so I got to try it without ordering a whole case. I find it absolutely delicious. So far it got used to make a black rice with dried cranberry dish, very simple. Tomorrow a pumpkin curry soup, then I think a chicken curry the next day. I'm looking into making my own coconut milk so I don't have to worry about using a whole can before it goes bad, but meanwhile I am delighted with this brand in both taste and consistency.<br /><br />AND let me not forget to praise the manufacturer for resisting the temptation to add those poisons people think are preservatives (particularly sodium metabisulfite). I'd rather there were no guar gum, frankly, but was unable to find any without that at local supermarkets.

review/summary: Bad batch?
review/text: Normally the Thai Coconut milk is great - very smooth and tasty.  For some reason every can in the 12 pack I ordered was chunky meaning there were chunks of coconut in it.  It's kind of hard to drink chunks of coconut, and I didn't have anything to filter them out.  It was the same kind I always get (I checked the cans a few times) so I'm guessing I got a bad batch or something.

review/summary: The Lullaby
review/text: A beach on Ko Samui. A bikini-clad waitress brings you a coconut, then produces a machete. "Pour vous, monsieur," she says, bringing the blade down upon the coconut with a raunchy thwack that strangely excites you. Why did she speak French? You don't care. She unwraps a straw, and places it gingerly into the coconut. "Merci," you say, confused. You didn't order a coconut. Even so, as you sip the sweet sweet milk, the sound of the waves remind you of an old lullaby, and you close your eyes, adrift in the warmth of the setting sun.<br /><br />You open your eyes. You are in your apartment in Brooklyn. Was it all a dream? You are holding a 14-ounce unit of Thai Kitchen Pure Coconut Milk. Eleven units remain--maybe it wasn't a dream, after all.

review/summary: Cans received were 5/6 through edible lifetime
review/text: The cans I received were packaged in November of 2007, and expire in November of 2009, about 4-5 months from now.  Since I will only have 1/6 of the shelf life of the cans, I will give them 1/6 of a full positive rating, or one star.  This is a hazard of ordering from Amazon, I guess.  In a store I would have seen that and not bought them.

review/summary: It is not pure coconut milk - contains ghar gum
review/text: Bought two cans of this brand to make coconut ice cream and one of my guests took one spoon full when I took the paddle out and had a serious allergic reaction causing her hives and other reactions.<br /><br />Since she had previously eaten a different dish with coconut milk from another company we looked to see the difference.  In this case the can said it was pure, but on the label at another place it stated that it contained ghar gum which is apparently used to thicken it so as to make it look more like coconut cream.  Search for ghar gum on the internet and see the possible complications before eating it.<br /><br />No one else had such a reaction, but not all the ice cream was eaten after seeing her reaction.

review/summary: Horrible!
review/text: This is bad coconut milk. It has guar gum which mixes the cream and liquid. They should be separate in the can, solid cream on top and liquid underneath. Tastes like flour and water, can't taste coconut! Very disappointed - made my usual great Thai curry taste poor.

review/text: This item is alittle pricey but it is a great way to sample all the Luna bars before buying.  I live in a rural area that only carry several of the Luna bars and I have been wanting to try other favors before purcasing in large quanity.  This box contained every favor of the Luna bars. It is awesome and I was so excited when I recevied my product and that I can now sample all the different Luna bars!

review/summary: delicious
review/text: Hooked on Indian food, but two hours from the nearest such restaurant, I suffer. However, buying a case of Jyoti's Madras Sambar is arguably as good as having such a restaurant closeby. I have never had better canned or bagged Indian dishes; by far the best of the lot. Madras Sambar is a favorite.
