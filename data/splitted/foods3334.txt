review/summary: Marley coffee
review/text: This coffee is good, and because it is organic, it is worth the price. It's got a nice, round flavor but could stand to be a little more robust. The pods of course are ultra convenient, but I would quibble with the fact that the individual pouches do NOT have a notch in them for easy opening. I have to cut each pouch with a pair of scissors.

review/summary: Nutty and Intense
review/text: First impressions of this coffee was not positive as the box contains no instructions what-so-ever as to what kind of coffee-maker is required for these pods. Additionally there is no mention of how much water to use with each pod, or whether it is a single or four cup serving.<br /><br />HOWEVER... Once that was settled (It is recommended between 6oz and 8oz of water per pod and it can be used in any traditional drip coffee machine, or used in the same fashion as a tea bag)... I was ultimately surprised and delighted at how dark and rich the resulting coffee looked. I brewed it at full strength the first time, to see what its got. I don't normally like my coffee super strong, but I was overwhelmed with the delicious aroma of this product. The first waft was clearly rich and nutty, although the packaging says exotic floral and berry. The taste was beyond anything I could hope for. I was shocked at how much flavor this coffee contained since it is also very smooth without being bitter. The second time I brewed this coffee, using the tea bag method and hot water, I actually let it soak until I was finished dressing for work, so around 15 minutes or so. Keep in mind I do not usually care for coffee that is overpoweringly strong, but the addition time only created a more intense flavor and aroma which, after only two experiences with it, I found myself craving a repeat experience. I added a little Splenda and plain creamer to it and rather than masking the flavor, the coffee-nutty-berry flavor came through with perfection.<br /><br />All in all I would say this coffee has performed better than any other brand of coffee I have had my hands on in the last year or two... which is saying something since I am considered fairly obsessed with quality coffee. The price is around sixty-three cents per cup and is MORE than worth it!!

review/summary: Good if you like Coffee
review/text: This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is "coffee flavored coffee", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors. That might make you mad if you're jonesing for that cup of coffee to wake up in the morning.

review/summary: Coffee good. Packaging not.
review/text: When I chose the Marley Coffee and Tea One Love coffee, I did not realize they came in "pods". (I don't even know what a pod brewer is and wikipedia was no help.) The box containing the coffee does not have any instructions as to how to brew the pod. When I researched the Marley website, it referred only to pod brewing. So, with only an espresso machine in my possession, I decided to be inventive and brew the pods that way.<br /><br />I like my coffee STRONG, and I found that 1 pod was too weak for my usual morning cup. If I can see through the coffee, it's not strong enough. Two pods are perfect; I just jam both into the ground holder. The taste is smooth, dark, slightly bitter, but still enjoyable and makes for a nice caffeine buzz. It's 100% organic and Fair Trade-very important to me. With the grounds contained in pods, it is easier to remove and keep the ground holder clean.<br /><br />The downside of the pod coffee is the separate foil packaging for each individual pod. I would prefer it packaged as a group in the box, like tea bags. However, the company does offer bags of beans which I find more preferable than ground coffee in a pod.

review/summary: Pretty good, if you have the right brewer
review/text: I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I do enjoy a good cup of coffee (with creamer) every now and then.  While I did not like the aroma of the organic coffee pod straight out of the foil pack (the box says it is 'Exotic Floral and Berry' whatever that is), I did enjoy the taste of the brewed coffee, once I figured out how to brew it.  Like others, I was unaware these were for 'pod' brewers, although this has been since updated to state in the product description.<br /><br />In fact, the box has NO instructions whatsoever.  I had to come back to Amazon to find out about using 8oz of water per cup.  A little less Marley/Jamacia on the box, and a few more instructions would be helpful.<br /><br />Since I don't own a pod brewer, I tried using a pod in my 'cup at a time' brewer.  All I got was slightly flavored hot water.  Not recommended.  Next I tried brewing one directly in a cup by adding boiling water.  While I got flavor, I also got sediment and aftertaste.  Again, not the recommended method.  Finally, I tried snipping open a pod and just using the loose grounds in my 'cup at a time' brewer with a standard paper filter.  I realize this is not the way the manufacture intended their product to be used, but as I said, since I was unaware this product was for 'pod' coffee makers, it was the best I had to work with.<br /><br />At last, I got to taste Marley's Organic Coffee in a good way.  Overall, I did like the taste (I drink mine with creamer).  Although I have to admit that I would not buy these at such a high price for just 15 cups of coffee.  Maybe if I had a pod brewer, I would.  But I really don't taste that much different to any other cup of good coffee.  As I said, I am not a coffee connoisseur, just someone who enjoys a good cup on occasion.<br /><br />This box of Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee includes 15 individually foil wrapped coffee pods, so that each cup will be as fresh as the last.

review/summary: Good smooth coffee for the right machine
review/text: My husband and I both enjoyed this coffee, it was smooth and easy to drink. I especially enjoyed it with a little bit of almond milk, it was perfect. I'm usually not much of a coffee drinker, I need it sweet or extremely smooth, so I was happy to find that this coffee was not as bitter as most. For those who need a nice, fresh easy coffee, I think this is perfect.<br /><br />It's important to note that these packets are for pod brewers, not your regular 8-10 cup coffee maker. They come conveniently packaged and my first thought upon opening them was that they're perfect for the small business! Hotels, bed & breakfasts, small offices, etc would all love this style of coffee that is convenient and individually made. I would definitely recommend it for someone in need of a good coffee for use at their small business. But also if you're a 1-cup a day sort of drinker, or someone who occasionally likes to make a very small pot of coffee--this is the perfect set up for you!

review/summary: Very Good Coffee
review/text: I like this coffee. It's a little different than the French roast I'm used to, but different in a good way. It's got just a hint of a smokey flavor. Maybe I'm not saying that right, but that's what it seems to me. It's rich, like French roast, but different, like I said. It's very good coffee.

review/summary: Nice Flavor, Not Too Strong
review/text: Seeing a Jamaican coffee label, I assumed this would be a STRONG brew.  In actuality, it is a relatively weak brew.  It has a very nice aroma, and the flavor is well-suited to those who like cream and sugar in coffee (in other words, not bitter).  Aside from the flavor, the package is fantastic!  One pad into the coffee maker, dump the pad into the trash, and viola, cleanup almost complete.  So much easier than filter and grounds.  Less mess, more stars!

review/summary: I had to improvise but I LOVED it
review/text: By improvising I mean that I have no coffeemaker other than my humble gold mesh basket that fits into a cup. So I put the pod into the bottom of the basket, added a little water to pre-prime it -- and then added hot water. With a soup spoon I imitated the process that a coffeemaker that uses pods would do: I pressed the spoon into the pod several times, and VOILA!! A WONDERFUL brew emerged in the cup. I enjoyed a cuppa with NO residual stomach acid and no bitterness -- I didn't even need sugar. Later, I added some soy milk and the taste was just as enjoyable.<br /><br />I liked reading the dedication on the box. This coffee was grown with care, and lovingly dedicated to an incredible individual, Bob Marley.<br /><br />Even though I will continue to have to improvise when brewing this coffee, I look forward to enjoying every single pod.

review/summary: OK coffee, but there are better alternatives
review/text: I like to experiment with different coffee, and these pods seemed to be nice to try on my pod machine. However, I found them not exceptionally good, and not a better value than some of the Senseo ones.<br /><br />The coffee itself it OK. It's not too bitter, and not too light. However it leaves a sour aftertaste. It's organic, which means, it's not from an acidic preservative they add, but probably the coffee itself contains this sourness.<br /><br />And also the pod size is interesting. They seem to be 1.5 the size of the other pods I have, and it difficult to have the right amount of water. The  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001QTVS5K">Senseo machine I have</a>) has two options, single pod (8 oz), or double (16 oz). Neither fits these pods well. I compensate the difference by changing the amount of cream I use, but it would be better to have the right amount in the first place.<br /><br />While it's better than some Senseo pods, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ES9FI">Senseo Dark Roast</a> -- which I find "burnt", and bitter, it's still inferior to many others (for example <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XZMD2G">Senseo Kona Pack of 4</a>. And the 4 pack offers better value per pod (even if I use double in a single cup), so there is little reason to prefer these over what I'm already used to at the moment.<br /><br />Unfortunately experimenting with these coffee did not end well. They are not better tasting than regular Senseo pods, they have a bitter after taste, the size is not right, and the price per pod is not as cost effective. It still is OK coffee, so I'm rating them 3/5 stars.

review/summary: Good coffee, good price, NOT for a Keurig!
review/text: First, I have to admit that when I was offered this coffee to review, I saw that there were 15 single serve pods and assumed that meant it was for a Keurig. Not so. Apparently there are actual coffeemakers that take these pods. Duh.<br /><br />I received them and had to do a bit of maneuvering to actually USE them, but it worked out fine. I just cut open the pod and put the coffee into one of my reusable Keurig cups and it brewed perfectly. I would imagine they would also work well in the proper machine ;)<br /><br />The coffee itself is a tad more bitter than I normally like, but that's just my own taste. I was able to try the medium roast, so I would personally go for the light, if possible. The flavor is great and I absolutely love that it's Fair Trade Certified, Organic, AND that partial sales are put towards youth soccer programs (kicksforcause.org). I love me some Dunkin Donuts coffee, but they are definitely not fair trade, organic, or donating any of their money.<br /><br />The packaging is perfect for the pods and the box is actually quite attractive.<br /><br />If you have a pod coffeemaker, I would definitely recommend this coffee for it's taste and the company's moral values. If you're buying pods anyways, you might as well make it from a company that offers portions of their money to charity and pays it's workers well!<br /><br />I was impressed!

review/summary: "Get Up, Stand Up, Stand Up For Your Coffee"
review/text: Bob Marley's son Rohan, besides being a noted athlete and musician, is also a successful entrepreneur, having started "Marley Coffee," the maker of "Marley Coffee, Stir It Up, Exotic Floral and Berry, One Love, Organic Medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffee," (fifteen single serve pods).<br /><br />Everyone in my family tried some of the coffee this morning and the results were generally very good; "smooth" x3, "nutty," x2, "nice taste," "I like mine a little stronger."  Pretty good comments from these life long coffee drinkers.  No one gushed that they were going to rush out and place another order, however.<br /><br />Bob Marley's name has been used to sell lots of things Bob probably wouldn't have endorsed while he was alive. To his credit, Rohan's signature actually appears on the outside of the box, so he is not technically appropriating his father's name.  He is asserting his own name and standing behind the product himself.<br /><br />Several of the drinker's this morning were hoping for a little THC mellow-out over their bacon and eggs.  Didn't happen.  However, everyone agreed that this coffee (which curiously doesn't smell that attractive before the pod is brewed) is worthy of the high-end packaging and its Ethiopian (and Jamacian) heritage.

review/summary: rich and smooth coffee
review/text: Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.

review/summary: Good coffee, but no directions for use or preparation.
review/text: I ordered these thinking they were an instant single serve coffee beverage similar to the Starbucks Via product. (Just add hot water and dissolve the single serve packet.) When I went to prepare my first cup I heated 16 oz of water to near boiling in the microwave, and added 2 pods to my cup and let it steep for about 3 minutes while stirring occasionally. That resulted in a weak but fairly tasty cup of coffee. You see, there are NO DIRECTIONS ANYWHERE ON THE BOX OR INDIVIDUAL PACKETS!<br /><br />I finally did a search on the internet and found the Marley website which explained these are coffee pods intended for use in a machine brewer. This would have been nice to know ahead of time. I don't even own a pod brewer. I ended up cutting open the pods and brewing them in my Bunn commercial coffee maker. The coffee is delicious this way but insanely expensive.<br /><br />I think if Marley provides some brewing instructions on the box and individual pods, this could be a good product as the coffee is very high quality, and rich and tasty.

review/summary: Intended for pod brewer; works used loose in French press
review/text: Packaging is very inviting, but there is not one word of instructions on the box or on the individually wrapped pouches.  When I opened the foil packet,the coffee fragrance was tantalizing. One side of the little pouch of coffee did say, "This side down." Not realizing they were for a pod brewer, I put them in my single cup drip maker with the appropriate side down--this yielded tasteless brown water like bad motel coffee that I threw away. Finally I saw one line on the Amazon product page that indicated these were for a pod brewer. Unfortunately, I do not have one, so I cut a little coffee bag open and dumped it into my single serve French press. This brewed a good, very strong cup of coffee.<br /><br />This is a decent product, but cries out for directions!!

review/summary: Great taste, but the packaging is strange to me.
review/text: The coffee has a very nice, chocolaty taste, very smooth, but the drawback was the packaging.  It comes in individual serving coffee bags, and I just have no idea how to use it.  I tried one cup like tea, pouring the water over it and letting it simmer, but by the time it got dark enough (I didn't know how long to steep it) it was cold.  I tried some other bags in a glass tea press, and that seemed to work better, but again didn't know how long to steep it.  There are no instructions on the package.  We usually make drip coffee, so maybe next time I'll just try stuffing a bunch of the coffee bags into the coffee maker.  I see the Amazon page says &lt;&lt;For Use only in Single Serve Home Coffee Pod Brewers>>.  I guess my problem is I have never heard of a Coffee Pod Brewer.<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP:  Today I put 8 of the pods in my drip pot and made 8 cups' worth and it was very good.  I called it chocolaty before, but maybe it's more like a mild cocoa flavor, slightly almond.  Very smooth and not at all bitter.  Great!

review/summary: Jamaica Mon
review/text: Four and One-Half Stars<br /><br />This coffee's packaging is a send-up of Jamaican style down to its name:  Marley Coffee.  (By the way, I actually saw Bob Marley walking by himself on West 57th Street in the late seventies).  Anyway, this coffee is meant for Pod coffee makers - did not realize this when I requested the coffee.  I do not own a pod coffeemaker.  You get 15 individual pod packets.  Each pod holds a single serving/cup of coffee.  To enable brewing in my coffee maker, I just cut the pods open and dumped into a coffee filter, and voila!  Coffee has nice rich aroma, and it has a full flavor.  It's definitely a better coffee than I had been drinking, which was your basic old school supermarket stuff.  For reference, I am not someone who tolerates strong coffee well.  Starbucks can give me a panic attack!  So, I thought the kick and richness was very nice and just right for me.<br /><br />As others have commented, if you're into that deep & dark, caffeine laden French roast, this may not be the coffee for you.

review/summary: Nice coffee but a little acid
review/text: It's always great to find a special product, and Marley Coffee is just such a find.  The pods are handy, and organic is a good thing as is Fair Trade.  I'm going to disagree, however, with the reviewer who found the coffee too weak if the pods are used like tea bags.  I found just the opposite.  The coffee produced in my machine was far weaker than that produced when I just stuck the pod in the cup and poured boiling water over it.  The result from the "tea-bagging" approach was strong and a little more acid than I like, but it had a good coffee flavor.  In the machine I got more of a "coffee-flavored water" result even when I used three pods together.<br /><br />It's worth a try if you have a single-serve machine and it's a handy way to carry your own coffee on trips as it truly does do fairly well in either machine or tea-bag use.  I suspect the flavor will be a matter of personal taste, so give it a try and decide for yourself.  There are other Fair Trade organic coffees out there, but this is the first I've come across in pods.

review/summary: Not bad
review/text: Unfortunately I got this coffee through the Amazon Vine program and nowhere in the description did it state that this product was for pod-type coffee makers. Also unfortunately, while the box says it holds "single serve pods" it does not specify that they're pods for a machine, or in fact what machines they work with.  The packets themselves say nothing at all about pods or machines.<br /><br />So here's the problem: I have a box of single serve coffee pods which don't really tell me much of anything, requested because I thought they were simply single-serve coffee bags, not unlike tea bags.  And I don't own a pod coffee maker.  I don't like them very much.  I'm going to have to improvise in order to do any sort of review.<br /><br />I tossed a couple of pods into my standard drip coffee maker and added two cups of water (The classic 6 oz cup by which coffee is still measured in spite of the fact that we now live in a world where 16 oz cups are considered small.) What I got back out was a brew that would make church coffee laugh derisively. So then I just threw two bags into a cup and added 12 oz of hot water, and let them steep until the brew looked darker, and that actually worked pretty well.  With due respect to the gentleman who said "teabagging" with these things doesn't work, I have to disagree.  It makes a decent enough cup.  The coffee isn't strong, but it is smooth, and has has the classic African warmth and brightness.<br /><br />In all fairness, the truest test of this coffee would be to use it in a pod-style coffee maker, but absent that, you can actually make a decent cup without much work.  Just remember that it's 1 pod to each 6 oz of water, no matter what the instructions say.<br /><br />Which brings me to a gripe.  Where the heck are people finding instructions?  There are none on the box, none on the individual packets.  The only instruction I found was on the pod itself.  One side says: "This side down"  Seriously, even if your product is for a machine, it's a good idea to be clear about how to use the product in that machine.<br /><br />All in all, Marley Coffee got points for flavor but lost them for unnecessarily vague packaging and the fact that it's kind of pricey.  I don't honestly think that I'd change my review substantially even if I had a pod-style coffee maker to test it with, however if I do manage to find one and it changes my opinion, I will absolutely update this review.<br /><br />Amazon, you need to give a bit more information in your descriptions for Vine reviewers.  At least to the point where you let us know if any special equipment is required to use a product.

However, if you want to make a great cup of coffee, then you need directions to show you how to get the most out of the coffee you are using.<br /><br />Although this coffee should be foolproof,(they are single serving bags, similar to a tea bag) there are no directions in the package to tell you how to make the best cup of coffee possible.<br /><br />I would like to have known things like:<br /><br />How much water do I use?<br /><br />Will filtered or distilled water make a better cup of coffee?<br /><br />How long should I soak the little coffee pack in the water?<br /><br />How hot should the water be for the best brewing?<br /><br />The company has a great concept. They want to offer you a great cup of coffee, that's environmentally friendly, and they want to help kids at the same time. You've won my heart. However, they had all the information you need to know about the company, its ideology, causes they support, and even where the coffee comes from and how the coffee is produced.<br /><br />Like I said, there were no brewing recommendations/directions on the package or in the box. If you don't mind a little trial and error, this is a great product. Get it right, and the coffee tastes great.

review/summary: Good Taste but Expensive
review/text: I make my own coffee at the office.  I have a coffee cup, water, and a microwave oven.  I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1KJO">Folgers Coffee Singles</a>, which resemble tea bags. I place water in the coffee cup, heat it in the microwave, and then plop the Folgers in the hot water.  The result is acceptable, but not great,<br /><br />Although, the Marley coffee may not be designed for tea bag use, that is how I tried it.  I have found that the flavor is good and the taste is strong enough depending on how long the packet is left in the water.<br /><br />On the plus side, the Marley coffee can be used in a tea-bag manner, has good taste, and is fair trade coffee.  On the minus side, it costs around twice as much as the Folgers.  I will have to continue to experiment with it to see if it justifies the extra cost.

review/summary: No pizzazz!
review/text: After finding the right way to brew this coffee - as strong as I like it - , I realized that there was nothing extraordinary about the flavor.  It's not completely bland, it just doesn't have anything special that would make me want to buy it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Organic<br />- Part of the money goes to a good cause<br />Cons:<br />- Nothing special in the type of roast.<br />- Too high price.<br /><br />I'd rather stick to other brands that I like better than buy Marley coffee.

review/summary: Try these first ...
review/text: If you are considering purchasing the David's Signature Jelly Beans, this is a great place to start. This contains 16 different flavors, from bacon (not my favorite) to a lemon so sweet and natural you would think you were on the porch drinking lemonade with your Grandma and Grandpa.<br /><br />David was the original inventor of Jelly Bellies, and when he finally re-entered the competition he worked hard to come up with something even better. In my book, he has done that. While these are pricy, they ARE very true to flavor, and have no artificial flavorings or colorings. Where the jelly belly won our hearts with their intensity, these will win out with their true-to-life flavor. It is as though the originals were made for children, these were made for adults.<br /><br />I understand that these are being introduced into some of the upscale candy stores soon, but for now, the only place near me where I can buy them is, well, Amazon.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of my opinion of the different flavors<br /><br />First Row:<br /><br />Bacon: Too much like a slab of bacon for my taste. Save these for the guys to prove how tough they are.<br /><br />Black cherry: These are NOT cherry, they are black cherry, and rest nicely on the tongue. Mmmmm. Good.<br /><br />Blueberry: These are more the taste of blueberry muffins than blueberries off the vine, at least in my opinion. So I guess I better leave them out of my recipes using real blueberries. If you are a blueberry fan, these will tickle your palate.<br /><br />Coconut: So real tasting I'm surprised you don't have to pound them against a rock to get into them. :-) Actually, I like the way these have a fruity aftertaste.<br /><br />Second Row:<br /><br />Cranberry: I have made my own sauce from fresh, and these don't carry quite as much taste. But for a Jelly Bean, they have a tart cranberry flavor. Definitely a winner.<br /><br />Ginger: These are so real I may have to grate these into the next recipe I have that calls for Ginger. In fact, I may save these and use them as decorations on my home made Gingerbread Men. That is if I don't scarf all of them down ... Ooops too late. Maybe I can buy the pound pack next time.<br /><br />Grape: Are you a fan of grape Koolaid? That's exactly what these remind me of, except my Mom always skimped on the sugar, and the super sweet flavor of these makes one Jelly bean taste as good as a full cup of that powdered stuff. I found myself sticking out my tongue to see if it turned purple!<br /><br />Green Apple: This has a strong "sour apple" flavor, which mellows to sweet as you eat it. Not apple pie, something cleaner. I tried it with the Cranberry and loved the two together.<br /><br />Third Row<br /><br />Himalayan Sea Salt: Ummm, these are salty. And sweet. I'm still trying to decide if I like them plain. I really like them with my Godiva Chocolates, but that might be cheating. You will have to make up your own mind on these.<br /><br />Lemon: Fresh squeezed lemonade ... slightly tart, nicely sweet. Clean tasting. If I could make my lemonade this perfect, I'd be in heaven. Sadly, I no longer live in the citrus belt, so I have to visit family in California to get the fresh stuff. They hit the mark with this flavor.<br /><br />Orange Punch: It is oranges, but I would guess it might have a bit of tangerine mixed in. If you have ever eaten home style candied orange peel, you will recognize this flavor. I think they might have called it orange punch since it doesn't taste like a fresh orange. Like some of the other flavors, it gets more sweet as you eat it.<br /><br />Peach: I have my own Sweet Georgia Peach tree, and these are not as good as a home picked peach ripe and warm from the sun with the juice running down my chin. However, they are peachier than most things I have tried that are peach flavored, and will make do when I can't eat mine fresh. More of a peach smoothie flavor ... but I'm pretty picky about peaches. The best part about these is you don't have to peel them to enjoy them.<br /><br />Fourth Row<br />Pomegranate: After my first bite, I was sure it was real fruit and checked for seeds. Nope, just a jelly bean. This is another right-on flavor.<br /><br />Root Beer: Another area where I am picky ... I had to decide, is it A&W or Mugg? Actually, when I was young and had a job at A&W I used to draw frosty mugs there. This tastes a lot like the fresh drawn A&W with a nice head on top.<br /><br />Strawberry: I'm surprised they included this because it is such an overused flavor. So I sat back and rested, concentrating on the flavor, hearing only the flavor (oops, that's my meditation tape, sorry). These have more of a fresh strawberry taste, just like the ones you would cut to put on top of your angel food cake. In fact, if they had a whipped cream variety, I'm sure they would taste nice together. Not as stong as the Pomegranate, but a nice taste all of their own.<br /><br />Vanilla Bean: Have you ever tasted Vanilla flavoring? Yuch, it tastes nothing like the flavor you are expecting from the aroma. This tastes like what Vanilla Flavoring should taste like. As it got sweeter, I started hearing the cranking of the ice cream maker, and realized that it reminded me of the vanilla ice cream my grandma used to make.<br /><br />Loads of different flavors. These come in a nice box and would make an excellent gift for someone who enjoys the very best.<br /><br />If you are looking for an unusual gift for the man in your life, you might want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> which includes some wilder flavors along with some of these. They even package the Habanero separately to keep the men safe ...<br /><br />I am grateful to have received this sampler in order to try these out, and am happy to post my opinion of them in a review. These are, indeed, beyond gourmet. (Ends review and sneaks off to eat the rest of these wonderful Jelly Beans).

review/summary: From the creator of the original Jelly Belly comes a new and even more outstanding bean!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:27 Mins<br /><br /></span>What Jelly Bean could be better than a Jelly Belly? One of these David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, that's what could. David Kline, the original inventor of Jelly Belly has found a way to make something even better than his first Jelly Beans.<br /><br />What makes them different? First, they are made with natural ingredients, including the coloring. After years of issues, I learned I was reacting to Yellow #5 food coloring that is in so many foods, including my well loved Jelly Belly's. My daughter, we learned when she turned 5 and had a Blues Clues birthday cake, has a sever allergy to Blue food coloring. This is when I learned to love companies that go the extra mile to put quality natural food coloring in their products.<br /><br />Second, the taste of these beans is different than the Jelly Belly. More natural and accurate, I feel they have nailed the flavors better than their competitors. The shine on these beans is astounding. They glisten like little gems in their box. But while they may have a shine and are all natural, they are also made with just the right amount of "softness". They aren't hard in any way. This makes them taste even more fresh, not like so many other beans out there that almost crunch when you bite into them.<br /><br />The flavors are:<br />Bacon<br />Black Cherry<br />Blueberry<br />Coconut<br />Cranberry<br />Ginger<br />Grape<br />Green Apple<br />Himalayan Sea Salt<br />Lemon<br />Orange Punch<br />Peach<br />Pomegranate<br />Root Beer<br />Strawberry<br />Vanilla Bean<br /><br />By far my favorite it the Pomegranate, it's amazing. The Coconut is so delicious. Much more realistic tasting that the artificial tasting ones you typically find. The ginger is just right in flavor. Reminds me of drinking a Ginger Ale. Just enough flavor to be delicious, with only a hint of "bite" to it. Bacon and Sea Salt are definitely the more unique ones of the batch. They are the ones you try between the sweet ones, for a twist of flavor to saltiness. Blueberry is divine and the Green Apple and Lemon are not too sour, which is nice. The Peach and Strawberry have an almost cream soda taste to them. The grape and cranberry are mild, not tart like a concentrated drink. And lastly the Vanilla Bean and Root Beer have a very authentic taste, neither being too overly sweet.<br /><br />So if you're looking for some very unique flavors, David's Gourmet Beans also makes flavors like Habanero (packs a serious punch), Wasabi, Thai Chili and Chipotle. While these flavors are not included in the sampler, they are included in other mixed from this company and you can find them in products such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans, Man Mix</a>. I had an opportunity to try them, in addition to the flavors in this sample box and they are exploding with flavor! Like nothing else out there.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a delicious new candy with natural ingredients, I highly recommend these new<br />David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans. I am not only thrilled to have been able to try these out for reviewing purposes, but I plan to place several orders for more in the very new future!

review/summary: Delectable jelly beans with 100% natural flavors & colors.
review/text: This new line of jelly beans by David Klein, the creator of Jelly Belly jelly beans, is made with 100% natural flavors and colors. That will be great news to those with allergies to food colorants as well as to those who prefer to keep the amount of chemicals in their snacks to a minimum.  In addition to this "taste of everything" sampler, the beans are sold in several different mixes (like the 5-alarm spicy Man Mix or the fruity Soda Fountain Mix) as well as individually, so you can really create the bean collection that works for you!<br /><br />This sampler includes 16 flavors. Among people I know who have tasted these beans, there is a great divide in likes and dislikes--some that I hated, others loved and vice versa. Every person is different, so just because I hated something doesn't mean you will.  That said, following are my personal impressions on each flavor in the sampler:<br /><br />*****My Favorites--Could eat them again and again (and already have!).<br /><br />Grape: Tastes like Nehi grape soda from my childhood, sweet but delicious.<br /><br />Strawberry:  Bright, sweet flavor with a nice finish. Reminiscent of strawberry preserves.<br /><br />Root Beer:  Sweet and tangy, addictive and satisfying. Maybe my #1 fave.<br /><br />Pomegranate: Sweet and tangy, but in a totally different way than root beer. Yum!<br /><br />Cranberry:  Sweet and tart; like dried cranberries vs. fresh.<br /><br />Orange Punch: DELISH! Very sweet, bright flavor. Can almost taste the carbonation as if it was orange soda vs. orange punch.<br /><br />****My Liked-but-not-Loved List--Enjoyed, but don't crave them like the faves.<br /><br />Coconut: Very distinct, spot-on flavor, but pretty strong. Best in combination with other beans. Not something I could eat again and again by itself.<br /><br />Vanilla bean: Same reaction as coconut. Good in combo, not in volume alone.<br /><br />Green apple: Could have been more tart.  Tasty but a bit bland.<br /><br />Peach: Quite intense. More like peach nectar than a fresh peach. Didn't love the finish.<br /><br />Lemon: Expected it to be a fave, but it wasn't. It has the tartness of a fresh lemon, but would have preferred a sweeter taste, as was done with grape and orange (like lemonade).<br /><br />Black Cherry: Also expected to be a fave, but wasn't. I am liking it more and more as I try it, though. Better alone than combined with other flavors and better with 2 or more of the same flavor at once. Wish it had a deeper flavor.<br /><br />Blueberry:  I liked the inside but didn't care as much for the shell. Tastes more like a blueberry muffin than a fresh blueberry, but that is a good thing in my eyes. :)<br /><br />Ginger:  Powerful! Very spicy, like biting into fresh ginger. The flavor is beautifully reproduced, but was a bit overpowering for me to want to eat many.<br /><br />**Least Favorites--Flavors I have no desire to eat again.<br /><br />Bacon: Man, I WANTED to love this! I love bacon! But I didn't love this bean.  I didn't even like it.  It tastes more like Liquid Smoke than bacon. Yuck. Don't suggest you mix it with any of the sweeter beans.<br /><br />Himalayan sea salt:  Strange/alien on the tongue at first, but kind of interesting while chewing. This one was originally on my Liked-but-don't-Love List, but then I realized I had no desire to ever eat another one. Also tastes worse when eaten with other beans, esp. the sweeter ones.<br /><br />I wish there had been more mixable flavors in the sampler, like back in the days when Jelly Bellies were new and my colleagues and I were always thinking of new pairings to make delicious flavor combinations.  I did some combining in this sampler.  Can't say there was anything that really stood out as a great combo, though I would say if you don't like super sweet, you may want to eat the super sweet ones with something with a little tartness like the cranberry, pomegranate or lemon beans.<br /><br />Finally, the packaging was a little flimsy and my beans were intermingled when they arrived.  This was a bummer, since there are flavors that share a color and are hard to differentiate (like lemon and ginger, and the black cherry, cranberry and pomegranate) so if there was a flavor I disliked, it was hard to avoid it until I learned to distinguish the slight color or textural variations.  Some of the confusion could have been avoided by not putting like-colored beans in the "cubby" right next to one another, as lemon and ginger.<br /><br />All in all, a delectable bean with some very interesting flavors and natural coloring\flavoring!

review/summary: Cool Beans!
review/text: I have an almost insatiable sweet tooth.  Left to my own devices, I could snack myself into a coffin.  This Gourmet Jelly Bean sampler is just right for a guy like me who struggles with impulse control.<br /><br />The flavors of these jelly beans are so amazing that you really only need a few to feel like you've had a more substantial snack.  The flavors stay with you (in a good way) for a very long time, so you really only need two or three of these jelly beans to satisfy your craving.  And since the calories are pretty low, you won't get into too much trouble if you don't stop at two or three beans.<br /><br />This sampler has turned out to be a fun social activity too.  My family has had a lot of fun trying out different flavors and seeing who likes which ones better.  We've all pretty much agreed that we don't like the Bacon, which is surprising for a family like mine.  My son said that it's worse than his bacon lip balm.  But that's the only clunker in the pack.<br /><br />I seem to be the only one in the family who likes the Ginger.  That's OK.  More Ginger for me.<br /><br />I've also had a lot of fun seeing which flavors pair well with each other.  Vanilla Bean goes great with just about anything.  Himalayan Sea Salt is nice with some of the more sour flavors, like Cranberry--it adds kind of a margarita cocktail flavor.  Lemon and Ginger both pair well with a lot of the flavors.<br /><br />I've also tried some of the flavors that weren't part of this sampler.  The Chipotle and Thai Chile are both out of this world.  I can't believe how delicious they are.  I paired Wasabi with Sea Salt and that was really good.  I even like the Habenero; it's a good flavor without overdoing the pain.<br /><br />I'm very impressed with this sampler.  I typically don't feel like sample packs are a good value for me, because there are always flavors that I don't like as much as other ones, so those go uneaten.  This sampler has really defied the odds:  There has been something for everyone in my family.  Only the bacon is left behind.<br /><br />I was provided this sampler for review.

review/summary: These jelly beans are meant to be savored
review/text: These aren't the kind of jelly beans where you stuff a handful into your mouth.  These are meant to be savored and enjoyed one at a time.  Each has a vibrant, distinctive flavor, the kind you want savor, one at a time.  And this sampler is the perfect way to try a variety of David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans.  It provides a nice variety including bacon, black cherry, blueberry, coconut, cranberry, ginger, grape, green apple, Himalayan sea salt, lemon, orange punch, peach, pomegranite, root beer, strawberry and vanilla bean.  All of them were very good, but my personal favorites were strawberry, lemon, coconut and bacon.  I have to admit that the bacon was a strange flavor for a jelly bean.  Maybe that's why I liked it.  It had sort of a burnt flavor, like bacon when it's crispy.<br /><br />These jelly beans use natural flavors that are quite intense.  One of these small beans fills your whole mouth with flavor.  If you are really adventuresome you could try a pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a>.  The bacon, ginger and Himilayan Sea salt flavors from this sampler are included, but there is also a chipotle, Thai chili, wasabi and a habanero jelly bean that is three-alarm hot!  If you like unusual flavors you have to give them a try too.<br /><br />From what I understand David Klein created the first gourmet jelly beans some 35 years ago, so he's quite accomplished when it comes to unique flavors that are fun to taste.  Wouldn't this be the perfect thing for the Easter Bunny to leave for the adult jelly bean fans on your list?<br /><br />The manufacturer supplied me with this sampler for review.

review/summary: The Best Jelly Beans On The Planet
review/text: These jelly beans are from the creator of the Jelly Belly jelly beans. The difference is in the quality. Dave's Signature jelly beans are made with all natural flavors and ingredients. These beans redefine the jelly bean. The flavors are like nothing you have ever tasted. The Orange Punch is simply delicious. The coconut is decadent. The Habanero, well, have a glass of water handy. My Son's classmates LOVED the Habanero jelly beans. Thai Chili, Wasabi are simply amazing. Yes, there is a Chipotle bean as well. The blueberry tastes like biting into a blueberry pie. You savor each bite of these amazing beans. My Son loves the Sea Salt bean. My Husband LOVES the bacon flavored. Not only are the beans the best you will ever taste, the creator is a kind and amazing person in his own right. David Klein is a one of a kind soul. He is as kind as he is creative. Once you try them I guarantee you will want no other bean again. I am sitting here munching on his Chipotle bean creation as I type this review and am enjoying every one of them. Oh, and don't forget to combine them to make even more amazing flavor bursts to enjoy. I will not buy any other jelly beans because they just do not compete with David's Creations! I highly recommend you give them a try. You will NOT be sorry.

review/summary: Wonderful Indulgence
review/text: David's Jelly Bean sampler has a little something for everybody. From root beer to Himalayan sea salt, the flavor range is well represented.<br /><br />These are really nice jelly beans. Some of the flavors are just slightly intense and others are subtle. The great news, they all taste like the genuine article without a strong chemical flavor.<br /><br />All the jelly beans are tender and have a light outer coating. The outer coating is much thinner than other jelly beans, so the full flavor jumps out a lot faster in the mouth. These are fun jelly beans; they aren't perfectly formed and have a more artisanal look to them. The flavor guide on the box top threw me for a loop, in my brain, it is the mirror image of the compartment arrangement. Bacon is at the top of the picture, but the bacon compartment is closest to the top hinge, or bottom of the picture.<br /><br />Overall, I like this box a lot. The flavor mix is unusual. My favorite by far is root beer - it tastes just like eating a glass of root beer. My least favorite by far is bacon. No, that just flat out doesn't work. I love bacon and maple syrup (so sweet and bacon is not a problem to me), but this is just way too weird. My 15 year old son actually spit it out, he disliked it so much. Frankly, that is the only loser in the box. The big love flavors with three of us trying out the box were pomegranate, root beer, orange punch, green apple, and strawberry. The middle pack was cranberry, lemon, ginger (spicy flavor, strong fresh ginger flavor, like a really good ginger beer, not Canada Dry ginger ale - too strong to eat a lot of them), black cherry (not enough cherry flavor), blueberry, grape, strawberry, and peach. Bringing up the rear, Himalayan sea salt (just a little too weird, not bad, but weird), vanilla bean (a little too sweet and the vanilla wasn't sharp enough), and coconut (maybe it seemed a little too much like Coppertone sun block).<br /><br />These are an indulgence. They are superior to other brands of jelly beans. The flavors are a lot cleaner, the beans softer, and the after taste is more pleasant.<br /><br />The great news about these beans, the ingredient line, not 100% all natural, but super minimal chemicals. No high fructose corn syrup.<br />Here's the ingredient line:<br />sugar, corn syrup, cornstarch, dextrose, fruit concentrates (apple, lemon, tangerine, peach, strawberry, blueberry, raspberry, black cherry, grape, cherry, pomegranate), citric acid, pectin, color added (fruit and vegetable extracts, annatto, turmeric, saffron, caramel color, titanium dioxide), natural flavors, sodium citrate, ascorbic acid, bees wax, carnauba wax, confectioners glaze. The last three ingredients are great to note - most beans use thick carnauba wax for the outer coating. David's chose to use three ingredients that make the shell thinner and easier to eat.<br /><br />The manufacturer supplied me with a box for review.

review/summary: Great Selection of High End Jelly Beans - Highly Recommended
review/text: This David's Signature "Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler" contains an eclectic mix of delicious jelly beans. These flavors are from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this sampler to review since my family loves jelly beans. Here are my opinions of the included flavors, in order of my favorites:<br /><br />* Coconut - Very strong natural coconut flavor, my favorite one<br />* Vanilla Bean - Very good tasting, natural vanilla flavor<br />* Pomegranate - Totally nailed this one! So good!<br />* Ginger - Crisp natural ginger flavor, every bit as good as the fresh ginger candy we get locally<br />* Cranberry - Really very good and natural tasting<br />* Root Beer - Amazing, can almost feel the fizz!<br />* Green Apple - So good! Very natural apple flavor!<br />* Peach - Very good juicy peach flavor<br />* Strawberry - Very good, reminds me of strawberry and cream<br />* Lemon - A little milder than expected, very good "clean" flavor<br />* Black Cherry - Very natural tasting but a tad bit over sweet<br />* Grape - Great grape flavor, not quite as strong as expected<br />* Orange Punch - Good flavor, not overpowering<br />* Blueberry - Good, but somewhat understated<br />* Himalayan Sea Salt - Very odd choice for a jelly bean, but it is a surprisingly enjoyable flavor<br />* Bacon - Does indeed taste like sweet smokey bacon, a fun novelty flavor but not one I'm going to eat all the time<br /><br />My list of favorites differs a little in order from other members of my family, as might be expected since everyone has different tastes, but every one of these rates higher than any other manufacturers similar jelly bean flavor we have tried. Combining some of these flavors is also fun with ginger and lemon being my favorite, producing a very clean and refreshing sensation.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with 100% natural flavors and colors, and includes an impressive list of fruit concentrates fairly high up in ingredients list.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: THE BEST jelly beans in the world!!!!
review/text: A few weeks ago, the Lenny and John Show was contacted by an associate of David Klein's asking us if we would have David on as a guest on our show as he was the inventor of the Jelly Belly.  Of course we jumped at the chance simply because, who doesn't love Jelly Bellies?  What we later learned was the incredible story of how David Klein came to invent the Jelly Belly in 1976 and then got forced out only four years later for only a tiny fraction of what the value actually was.  Don't take our word for it, you can see it all in the documentary that was made about him, Candyman: The David Klein Story.<br /><br />That was some background to tell you how we got introduced to this product.  Prior to David appearing on our show, we received 10 packs of David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans in unmarked plastic bags.  They were unmarked so that when we tasted them on the air for the first time David could get a true reaction from us for not just the taste of the jelly beans but also how authentic the flavor was.<br /><br />We interviewed David over a three hour period.  I know that seems like a long time, but it actually flew by - he is a fascinating man with a wealth of knowledge about the candy business and the world in general.  Anyway, periodically, David would pick a number for us to try and we would try a jelly bean from that numbered bag.<br /><br />These beans were amazing.  The flavor was incrediblly strong and the taste was like actually eating the fruit or other food that they were patterned after.  We received no money or any other form of payment from David - our reactions were completely unbiased and honest, even down to the moment when I spit out the habanero flavored bean because it was too hot.  If you would like to listen to the show and hear our unedited reactions, you will get the next best thing to tasting them for yourselves.<br /><br />If you love Jelly Bellies, these will blow you away.  They are a little pricey compared to other jelly beans, but honestly they are a level above all others.  The flavor is so intense you don't find yourself eating them by the handful either.  One bean can be savored and enjoyed which may save your waistline too.  To hear the interview, go to [...]

review/summary: How real Jelly Beans should taste
review/text: I was recently given a box of these gourmet jelly beans by a friend, and don't think I'll be eating any other jelly beans for quite some time. I love the fact that they're created by David Klein, the inventor of Jelly Belly (which David is no longer affiliated with).<br /><br />A few of my favorites:<br /><br />Coconut: Just the right amount of creaminess and tropical flavor. David needs to make a Pina Colada based off of this!<br /><br />Blueberry: All the berries in this box were wonderful. The blueberry is particularly tasty.<br /><br />Cranberry: Love the tartness. Balances out all the sweetness.<br /><br />Peach: I'm just a sucker for peaches.<br /><br />Pomegranate: Made with real pomegranate juice! Really does taste like it - not overly tart, just right.<br /><br />Root Beer: I felt like I needed to put a few ice cubes in my mouth to make it like a real root beer. Classic.<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing what David does with these flavors - I know there's a lot more from where these came from!

review/summary: Remarkably intense, natural flavors
review/text: If you are looking for a treat with a high flavor-to-calorie ratio, the concentrated, natural flavors of David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans will get your full attention.  They are noticeably fresher and slightly softer in texture than other tiny jelly beans.<br /><br />I was fortunate to receive a sampler pack that included the sixteen flavors in this sampler plus the four spicy hot ones that are included only in the savory <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">Man Mix</a>.  There are also other mixes available such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLLK6">Fruit</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBMAS8">Soda Fountain</a>.<br /><br />Vanilla bean has visible flecks and the unmistakable flavor of vanilla beans that you would expect from a carriage-trade jelly bean.  I suggest that you try these first to really enjoy the full effect.  They are good with almost any of the fruit flavors but especially with orange punch, strawberry, and coconut.<br /><br />The root beer beans are fantastic.  If you have ever bought the little hard root-beer flavored candies and been disappointed, try these; they taste like a whole bottle of natural root beer in one little bite.  Add half a vanilla bean jelly bean and you have a float.<br /><br />The coconut has a dense, creamy coconut flavor and it's one of my favorites.  It combines well, too.<br /><br />The strawberry ones have a flavor that is so intense, like strawberry preserves, that it is hard to believe it is natural.  Same for the peach ones, which don't really taste like fresh peaches but more like peach jam.  If you like peach Jolly Ranchers or peach Nehi but not that artificial aftertaste, you will really enjoy these.  The green apple ones are also similar to Jolly Ranchers but with a clean flavor that increases as you chew.<br /><br />Grape tastes more like purple grape juice than grapes.  The blueberry is also very concentrated, like dried blueberries.<br /><br />The lemon ones are tart, almost like a little lemon explosion on the tip of your tongue.  The other citrus flavor, orange punch, was a bit of a surprise.  It tastes more like mandarin orange than a juice orange, a very good choice.<br /><br />Pomegranate has become a popular flavor but I haven't had it in candy before.  After tasting these, I have no idea why it is not even more popular.  The cranberry ones are a little milder and less tart than I expected after trying some of the other ones.  Black cherry is also on the subtle side but would you expect to be able to distinguish their black cherry taste from that of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H7LVKY">tart cherries</a>?  You can.<br /><br />The Himalayan sea salt jelly bean is instantly recognizable because of the distinctive mineral flavor.  I was impressed that they are not unpleasantly salty.  How did they do that?  It must have been difficult to get this one right but I like the results.  These are also good as a palate cleanser after some of the more assertive flavors.<br /><br />The bacon jelly bean reminds me more of cured country ham than bacon, with roughly equal notes of pork, salt, smoke, and sweet.  I don't eat much meat and at first I didn't particularly care for their intensity, similar to ham base, but when I started combining them with half of a spicy bean from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">Man Mix</a>, I enjoyed them much more and was very sorry when they were all gone.  They are also good with half of a black cherry jelly bean.<br /><br />The ginger ones have a very explosive flavor much like crystallized ginger but without the chewy fibers.<br /><br />I tried to pick a favorite flavor but kept changing my mind because they are all so good.  The only downside is that after eating these, you will be spoiled for other jelly beans because of the overall quality and concentrated, non-artificial flavors.  You may also decide not to share and experience a little guilt.  They really are that good.<br /><br />I will be excited to try new flavors from David's Signature Beyond Gourmet.  Here are my suggestions:  pineapple, passion fruit, cassis, pear, mango, clove, Earl Grey, lemon verbena, carrot pudding, kumquat, blood orange, and cherry cola.

review/summary: I really wanted to like these...really.
review/text: After watching the documentary (Candyman) I really wanted to like these. I waited until they showed up on Amazon and promptly ordered a box.<br /><br />They shipped quickly, and arrived well packaged. A few of the beans spilled over into other sections, but that was easily remedied.<br /><br />I couldn't wait so I started right away. The box smells like scratch and sniff stickers, or those smelly markers, which honestly surprised me because of their commitment to natural flavorings. Very off putting.<br /><br />Here goes:<br /><br />Texture: I don't know if it's just a personal thing, but the textures are all off. A few are a little chalky, while the rest are way to soft. They stick to your teeth way too much. Somehow they are grainy also. Again, I'm used to the chewy texture of Jelly Bellies...<br /><br />Flavors:<br /><br />The fruity flavors have a weird salt flavor. Almost like energy gel or the Jelly Belly Sport beans. It's a little strange...<br /><br />Bacon: I tried. I couldn't finish it. It tastes like a cup of sugar with a fat piece of bacon in it. Good if you like your bacon drowned in sugar.<br /><br />Black Cherry: It tastes like sugar and not much else. I tried it several times to see if I had gotten a dud, but they don't taste like anything...none of them.<br /><br />Blueberry: It tastes way too salty with some granola overtones and a sour finish...weird, but not so bad.<br /><br />Coconut: If it weren't for the texture this would be awesome. Great coconut flavor.<br /><br />Cranberry: It almost tastes like sour raisins...weird. It has a cranberry juice aftertaste...I really wanted this one to be awesome.<br /><br />Ginger: Awesome. Awesome...very strong ginger flavor.<br /><br />Grape: So salty...almost a little like grape, but it really tastes way too salty with some chemically background flavors. Not good.<br /><br />Green Apple: So bad...it tastes nothing like apple at all. So bad.<br /><br />Himalayan Sea Salt: Really weird, salty, but also off puttingly sweet.<br /><br />Lemon: Tastes like lemon Pledge.<br /><br />Orange Punch: Totally Sunkist. Awesome.<br /><br />Peach: It totally tastes like Peach rings. If you eat it quickly to avoid the chemical smell, this is totally one of the best flavors. Eat it quickly though.<br /><br />Pomegranate: Tastes more like Cherry, but it isn't too bad. Doesn't taste like Pomegranate though.<br /><br />Root Beer: The best flavor. Without a doubt.<br /><br />Strawberry: One of the best. Not bad.<br /><br />Vanilla: Tastes like vanilla bean. Kind of like melted vanilla ice cream.<br /><br />If it weren't for the inconsistent textures, the chemical smell, and the bad fruit flavors these could be good. Which is really a shame since the fruit flavors are usually my favorite jelly bean flavors. Personally, for now, I'm sticking with Jelly Bellies. Dang.

review/text: These aren't your kids' jelly beans!  I ordered 4 lbs of beans to enjoy at  a St Patrick's day party.  Green and gold, of course.  Our guests had fun guessing the flavors - ginger, tangerine/orange, wasabi, and apple.  We also enjoyed the sampler package which introduced us to an amazing and clever array of unique tastes.  Chipotle, habenaro,  bacon, and sea salt top the list of favorites besides the jelly beans we enjoyed at our party.  Serving this  fun candy was trumped only by the arrival of the Travelocity gnome.

review/summary: Quality Country Ham
review/text: It's always a crapshoot when buying country ham products from an unknown vendor. The quality can be inconsistent even from people you've dealt with before. I was just in North Carolina in March and bought 3 packages of of ham from 3 different suppliers at the local Red Lion store. On one was even halfway satisfactory so upon my return home to home to Ohio I decided to try this Phillips Brothers I saw on Amazon. What a pleasant surprise. The shipment arrived within 2-3 days. I could tell just by looking at the meat that these were quality center cuts. Not dried out, or discolored with very little fat. The taste is perfect. Just the right amount of salt without numbing your mouth so this doesn't have to be soaked or rinsed to remove the excess brine altough some people may want to for their particular taste. I've fried this, nuked it and grilled it on the George Foreman and it's really good any way I prepare it. My family is from North Carolina and we'd bring home a huge ham every summer from one of the family member's smokehouses. This Phillips Brothers product brings back fond memories of those homemade hams. I will buy this again.

Sometimes they will eat another type of treat but after 1 or 2 days, they refuse to eat anymore. These are the best!<br /><br />ps: when your cat gets bored with a favorite toy, don't throw it out. Put it away in a closet for a few months & one day when they seem bored again, bring it out of the closet and give it to them. They will be excited about it again. Cats are like kids so rotate the toys and everyone will be happy.

It's not just my cat either; my friend's cat doesn't like them as much as the ones in the orange or blue bags.  Stay away from the cheese flavored ones in the yellow bag; I can only assume they're really gross as they just set in the dish, untouched.

I got these because my cat went crazy over the cheese puff treats I bought at Target, I think they are call crispies or something. They literally almost ripped the bag apart when it was left closed sitting on the counter because they can smell it through the bags. I have 2 kittens and they fought each other whenever I grab for the bag, no other time do they act like this it's almost as if it's drugs or something. I was hoping for the same effect with these, but my kittens both treat these like it's slightly tastier dry food. P.S. I have 1 himalayan and 1 orange tabby.

review/summary: Only one of two she will eat.
review/text: Oh my goodness, I have the most spoiled cat. She loves her treats and there are only two products she will eat. I ordered this on the subscribe and save and this morning I cancelled it. Reason being it takes much longer to get, it comes via the<br />USPS which means I had to walk to the other building in our apartment complex, to my mailbox to get this. Would be no big deal but I am disabled so it is very difficult for me.<br />This subcribe and save is a very good deal if you don't have the problems that I have.

review/summary: Friskies Review
review/text: My elderly friend's cat loves these treats. We've tried several other brands and he won't eat them. The Amazon price is better than the price at my local Publix store. I've ordered this four times now.  It is usually delivered in a timely manner. One shipment didn't arrive. I notified Amazon and they sent another one the same day. I will purchase this product again.

review/summary: MY CAT LOVES THESE
review/text: My cat can be a bit fussy about his food and treats but he absolutely loves Friskies Party Mix.  He's almost addicted and he even begs me for his treats and shows me where I keep them.  If I let him, he would eat an entire bag at one sitting. I often give my dog a few morsels and she also likes the taste.  I like the easy open pouch too.  It's a great product and I highly recommmend it. We are giving it 4 paws up :)

Our older cat, Cowboy, thinks he is quite refined and is very proper, even HE gets excited about these treats.<br /><br />Judging from the cat's behaviors these must be great treats!  Other treats just don't bring on as much enthusiasm, and to think I bought these on a whim and just grabbed any old bag.<br /><br />I'll be sure to buy the Wild West flavor from here on out!

review/text: I've given my cats a few different kinds of treats daily & these are by far their favorites.... They love them more than any of the others and come running as soon as they here me get the package out. Really helps clean their teeth so it helps get rid of that bad kitty breath from eating other soft chewy treats. I won't buy the soft treats anymore as thier breath is so bad from it & they love these the best & so do I. They cost $1.50 a pack in the Walmart store so they are even cheaper here to buy & no sales tax, at least not in Iowa on these. I haven't tried the other flavors because these give them a variety so why bother with just one flavor.

review/summary: Party mix is now one of my cat's favorite treats
review/text: The various Friskies "party mix" flavors of treats really appeal to my cat's taste buds. They are his new favorites. Especially the Beachside Crunch version. He used to be a treat fanatic, but lately he hasn't been eating as many treats because he's been filling up more on wet food; that's sort of replaced his "dry treat" routine. However, he usually will still eat the party mix if I give it to him, even if he shuns other treats.<br /><br />And one other great thing about party mix - the price is cheap, but you get a lot for your money, since it is a good-sized bag. Great taste, great value - what's not to like?

review/summary: I Love These, So Good Tasting and Very Spicy - Highly Recommended
review/text: These David's Signature Beyond Gourmet "Habanero" jelly beans are spot on in habanero flavor and are actually fairly spicy (but not in the practical joke range). I love all things spicy (my wife says I'm not human in this regard) and enjoy all sorts of hot peppers, so since it has both spicy heat and a realist habanero taste, these are now one of my favorite things. The rest of my family is split on these, with my wife that saying they are way too hot for her and my son says he enjoys the flavor but is on the borderline with the heat.<br /><br />This flavor is from David Klein, the creator of the famous "Jelly Belly" jelly beans, so I was thrilled to be offered this in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a> to review since my family loves jelly beans.<br /><br />I also really like that these jelly beans are made with natural flavors and colors.<br /><br />Highly recommended for those that enjoy hot peppers!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Too Hot For Me - I'm a wimp
review/text: OK, I'll admit it, label me a wimp. No, I could not eat one of these beans. I managed to bite into the bean and lick the inside. My brain took over and told me, that is too spicy to eat, don't chew the rest. My wife agreed and could not eat a bean either.<br /><br />My 15 year old son decided to man up and ate one. He said they weren't too spicy (he says that about anything I say is too spicy), but the heat got trapped under his tongue so it hung around for a while. I have to agree with his assessment; the spice flavor is really good. They are hot, but not stupid hot (nothing but heat with no flavor).<br /><br />These are darn good jelly beans. I've tasted the other jelly bean flavors in this new product line; habanero and bacon are the only two I don't care for. All the others have a nice clean flavor in a tender jelly bean.<br /><br />Well if somebody that is going to eat these beans cares about ingredients - these don't have high fructose corn syrup in them. They aren't 100% natural, missing that label with a few minor ingredients. Sugar, corn syrup, starch, and fruit juice are the major ingredients.<br /><br />If I loved habaneros and wasn't such a whim, I'm confident I would love these.

review/summary: Great for the Big Game
review/text: I received a complete set of samples of the David's Signature Jelly Beans, and being an aficionado of Jalapeno Jelly and other fun sweet and hot things tried these FIRST.<br /><br />These aren't quite as spicy as the real thing, but they definitely pack a punch. I am really enjoying these slowly, like one at a time. With tortillas on the side. A VERY good flavor, and perfect for those who like to live on the spicy side of life.<br /><br />If you want your buddies to get a real thrill pick a package of these up for the big game. They will show you how manly they are by gulping down a few.<br /><br />And if you notice them grabbing and drinking "just a little bit more" beer, or grabbing a handful of chips, or looking with a tear in their eye and claiming it was a bad play, just smile and keep passing the bowl around.<br /><br />If you want to try a variety of the Jelly Beans first, you can grab the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBO41E">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Flavor Sampler</a>, but they don't include this wonderful, spicy, pepper!<br /><br />You might also want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> which includes these and a wonderful assortment of beans for your next party.<br /><br />Beyond Gourmet is right, these make Jelly Bellies look like they are for wimpy kids.<br /><br />I am grateful that I received a complimentary set of samples, and am looking forward to purchasing many of the varieties in single flavors!

review/summary: Delicious and healthier alternative to other fried chips.  Nice cheese flavor.
review/text: I recently tried these, after usually sticking to the Black Bean Sea Salt flavor.  These are certainly different from that flavor, but just as enjoyable.  The cheese flavoring is the perfect flavor for my pallet.  I won't switch to these from the Sea Salt ones, but will definitely add them to my chip rotation.<br /><br />Since these are fried in oil, they are by no means a health food, especially if you are focused on calories. That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste. To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings. I enjoy them plain out of the bag, and also find that they are good with salsa or dip.<br /><br />I wish the price was a little lower on these and wish that the bags contained less air and more chips, but otherwise I think they are great. I highly recommend that you try them.  The pricing here on Amazon, is usually about 30 cents per 6 ounce bag cheaper than what they charge at the local grocery store, HEB.  Specialty stores like Sprouts and Whole Foods charge even more for them.

review/text: This is hands down the best way to get a dog to take a pill! We had to give our dog a pill twice a day and she caught on quickly to the peanut butter trick, the tomato slice trick, the hide-it-in-the-strawberry trick, and anything else I came up with to hide her pill in. But with these wonderful pocket treats, I think she knows the pill is in there, but she doesn't care! These have made my life so much easier. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />You can also just mold them like clay, so I buy the large pockets and use 1/3 of the pocket to mold the treat around her pill and they last quite a long time.

Either way, pill pockets does it. With the consistency of very soft children's modeling dough, I can quickly mold it around their pills and down they go. One of my doxies is a skeptic so he gets a bit more pocket around his! When I need to administer liquid I can use the pocket in it's molded form. If a pocket edge has a crack a pinch of the soft dough will seal it. They don't require refridgeration and they go a long way.

review/summary: A Fantastic Product!
review/text: One of our dogs takes multiple pills, twice a day.  He's reached the point where he can eat cheese and bread right around the pill you are trying to get him to swallow, and the "force him to swallow" method hasn't worked with him for a while.<br /><br />A family member recommended these as something she'd heard works, and it really does!<br /><br />The small size works great for a single small pill (think benadryl tablet or capsule size).  The Medium/Large size will hold two small pills, and would hold a single "medium" sized pill well.  The treat itself is very soft, and easy to mash around a pill that is a little larger than the hole allows for (or oblong, like a capsule).<br /><br />If your dog is on medication long-term, like mine, shop around and look for a good price, because there is quite a range out there.

review/summary: There must be a better way . . .
review/text: Having lived in Seattle and living in the Sonora Desert now, I occasionally get a craving for Dungeness Crab. Once a year a friend brings or ships a pound or so from up there, and my world is intact - for a while. I recently ordered this product to see if I can manage my addiction through amazon.com. With shipping, the 4 oz can was over $21. It contained quite a bit of liquid. The crab meat tasted well. However, it was predominantly of the small-fiber consistency, hardly any real great lump meat. It was NOT enough to make a decent Dungeness Crab Louis for one person.<br />So, this 4 oz can delivers a mediocre consistency, authentic in taste, appetizer at best.

review/summary: Crunchy!!
review/text: I am eating this Power Snacks Tropical Treasure right now for the first time. I got it from another source, but it tastes so good that I have to search the product online and of course Amazon has it. Yes it has banana, raisins, coconut. Not very natural if I read the package since it has Yellow 6 and 5 Artificial colors (no idea why)but it is very crispy, crunchy, and very sweet.

review/summary: Excellent natural popcorn
review/text: Natural, butter-free microwave popcorn is becoming very hard to find.  Thank goodness Newman's Own follows its usual high quality with this product.  The bag pops almost completely and the contents tastes just like popcorn, not like the greasy artificial quasi-butter-like-substance most microwave popcorns taste like.  If you want butter, melt some real stuff and put it on yourself.  But personally, this stuff doesn't need it.

review/summary: worst popcorn ever?
review/text: This popcorn left an unpleasant-tasting layer of some waxy substance that built up in my mouth---on my teeth, lips, and tongue---as I ate. This was so nasty the person I was sharing it with simply stopped eating it. I hate wasting food, so I ate the rest even though I didn't enjoy it.<br /><br />I'm really curious what ingredient might have been responsible for this phenomenon. Could it indeed be some kind of wax? Unfortunately I couldn't find this variety of popcorn on Newman's Own Web site. Perhaps it's been discontinued; I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.

review/summary: METAL CANS contains BPA
review/text: Please DO NOT BUY THE CANNED FORMULA.  IT CONTAINS BPA!  The BPA is in the inner coating of the metal cans.  According to Similac/Abbott Laboratories, the larger RTF plastic container is BPA Free - just AVOID THE CANS!!!<br /><br />I wanted to pass this information along to other moms/dads.  I am not an activist or someone who believes my child will never come in contact with a dangerous toxin.  But geez, as a society we go out of our way to make sure BPA is not in our baby bottles only to find out the my son is drinking the stuff!<br /><br />If you are like me, I was desperate to find a formula that would not cause my child pain to digest (like my breast milk & other formulas).  Sleep deprived and desperate to get out of the house, I thought the can RTF was a god send.  (Especially b/c my child didn't like the powder.)  I can't believe I have been using this product for 5 months.  SHAME ON SIMILAC!  Words cannot describe how truly angry I am.<br /><br />Every other RTF they sell is in BPA free plastic.  I feel like as parents of children with special dietary needs, we have been prayed on b/c we are desperate & could not use our power of the free market to purchase another BPA free brand.  I am just disgusted.  As a mom, I felt I needed to warn other parents of SIMILAC REPULSIVE AND UNNECESSARY PRACTICE.<br /><br />I wanted to post Similac's website just so you don't think I am some nut.  They conveniently don't list the metal can formula in their list of BPA free products. [...].

review/summary: Does have some BPA
review/text: Based on the previous review, I explored the website and talked with their customer service to find more information. First, they are working on making it BPA free, but for right now there is some BPA in these cans - according to Abbotts 50 times less than regulated limits, but it is not BPA free. We are keeping these for emergencies but primarily relying on the 32 oz container, since we do not want to take any risks with BPA.

review/summary: Caution Similac Alimentum Cans are a pain & contain BPA!
review/text: I am very disappointed to find out that the ready to feed cans of Similac Alimentum contain BPA.  I couldn't believe it so I had to research it for myself and it's true! All of Similac's other RTF formulas are in plastic BPA free containers.  The Alimentum also comes in a can that can not be stored for later use.  My baby only drinks 4-5 ounces at a time, it would be nice if the Alimentum RTF were in a plastic container that had a screw top so we could save the remaining several ounces for the next feeding.

review/summary: A reminder of Italy
review/text: I had a cooking class and the chef made a cake for dessert and used this product.  The cake was delicious although I can't state categorically that it was because of this product! :)  But, I was happy to find that I could buy it here in America if I wanted to just as a reminder of my wonderful trips to Italy.  I think that when I get around to trying it, if I use a recipe that calls for baking powder/soda AND vanilla, I will probably still include at least some of the vanilla.  I think in America, we are accustomed to more of the vanilla flavor than this product may give.  I look forward to experimenting a little with it.  Also, I did discover that it can be purchased in packages for a slight savings.  And is it any wonder we love all things Italian?  Isn't "lievito pane degli angeli" a lot more beautiful than baking powder!?

review/text: One of the best products ever!  All of my Christmas cookies, cuchedatte (Italian fig cookies) are so soft and tender.  The freshness lasts longer than American baking powder.  I absolutely love it and my family wonders what have I done to make the traditional cookies taste better.  Thank you for bringing this product to Amazon!

review/summary: POTENT!!
review/text: I was looking for something to spice up some homemade chili and this does it in spades. The order came in fast and, since I have a set of measuring spoons for very small amounts, I tried 2 smidgens worth. Definitely livened it up. I had heard of the Ghost chilies at 1 million Scoville units, so I was gentle with the use of this product. At 8 oz. there is a lot of chili powder and is best used in small doses if you value your tongue.

review/summary: Pepper head's new love.
review/text: Ordered and received the Ghost Pepper 8 oz.container<br />within 3-4 days. The quality was excellent, and the heat<br />was less than the Butch T. Scorpio I had tried the week before.<br />This was as I expected, an desired, as the Butch T. only has<br />heat but no taste. I've been a pepper head for 40+ years an<br />believe this is the highest quality ground pepper I have ever<br />purchased.<br /><br />For the reviewer that believes the powder had filler in it I say BULL.<br />If you put a spoonful of this stuff in your mouth, and didn't think it<br />was hot I have my doubts of the validity of your statement. One tsp. is<br />the same as 6 of the dried whole peppers that accompanied the 8 oz.<br />container.<br /><br />I have been blending pepper mix's for years and will use this to make my<br />Dragon's Breath, which my friends love. I plan on ordering more items and<br />recommending you to all my friends.

review/summary: Quality Product
review/text: I recieved the peppers within a few days after placing the order even though i used regular shipping. The powder itself came fully sealed plus included 2 bonus whole ghost peppers as a gift. I am a pepper head and i can tell you that this is about as good as a ghost pepper gets. The ground powder seems to be nothing but the jolokia pepper grounded up. It is a wonderfull buy, i chose the 8oz because i was skeptical of the quality, but not anymore. My next shipment will definetly be a full 16oz. Only downside i found to this purchase was that being an independent store there is an actual shipping fee instead of the amazon free shipping, but that is of no significance overall of how good the actuall produc is.
