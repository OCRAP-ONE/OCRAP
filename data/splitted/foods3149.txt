review/summary: excellent canned coffee
review/text: After one can, I'm hooked on this cappuccino.  The taste of Illy Issimo is absolutely stellar.  The coffee itself is very good, the best I've had in a canned coffee.  It's the closest to a fresh iced coffee taste I've found.  The blend of coffee and milk in their cappuccino is just right, not too much milk and it's not too sweet, either. I found the caffeine to be pretty gentle.  The can says 81 mg of caffeine per can, which seemed high but I did not get the jitters or a crash later on.  At 100 calories a can, it's not going to ruin your diet, either.<br /><br />I've been buying various coffees in cans and jars for years, and had not yet found one I really loved. Another popular brand has a cappuccino which is far too sweet and an espresso which is overcaffeinated.  I hope to see this in local stores soon.

review/summary: NO high fructose corn syrup!
review/text: I like coffee drinks so I was anxious to try this product. Right away I like that it does not contain high fructose corn syrup. Big plus. The lowfat milk makes it a little on the watery side. The blend of coffee and cocoa is quite good, but a little too sweet. It also has a bittersweet aftertaste. It does give you a nice caffeine boost without a stomachache, so it's low acid. If you like coffee drinks this is a good choice because it's lowfat, tasty and does not contain a long list of questionable ingredients. I recommend it.

review/summary: Not Much More Than Canned Coffee
review/text: So a canned cappuccino? Okay. And it's pretty much what it is, a milk-flavored canned coffee with some sweetness to it. The coffee flavor is okay, but nothing rich or textured or deep. I mean, what would you expect in a canned coffee, I suppose? The can is portable and thin, so it should fit in a bag or purse, and if you're ever prevented from carrying a thermos or Starbucks cup somewhere, but they allow sealed beverages, you could do worse than this.

review/summary: not to my taste -- too bitter
review/text: I have a shameful addiction to starbucks frappucino, and similar sweet, creamy, bottled coffee drinks, so I was looking forward to trying Illy's offering when I saw it available through Amazon Vine.  I'm sorry to say I did not care for it.  It wasn't awful, but it was not as sweet and creamy as I like such drinks to me, and it had a bitter/burned taste and a slightly metallic after taste.<br /><br />That said, my husband and son, who both like things less sweet than I do, enjoyed it somewhat more than I did. If you find frappucinos cloyingly sweet and too rich, you might like this.

review/summary: Average canned coffee drink made with quality ingredients
review/text: The Illy Issimo canned coffee is a decent tasting coffee beverage, not stale or acidic tasting, but not flavorful or fresh enough for my tastes. I enjoy Cappuccino that is very robust and rich, but this drink tasted similar to the many average tasting canned coffee drinks on the market.  The cappuccino taste is very sweet with a hint of chocolate and milky flavors, but not rich and creamy (the way I like Cappuccinos).  There is also 18 grams of sugar, and the can is only 8.45 ounces.  The caffeine and energy I received from the drink was respectable, similar to a regular cup of coffee.  I do like the fact that the drink is Kosher certified, made with real cocoa powder and sugar (not high fructose corn syrup).  The beverage is also and not made from milk containing rBST.  Unfortunately, the product's taste falls short compared to some of the better canned coffee beverages I have tried.

review/text: This cappuccino drink is really delicious. I know I could get addicted to it in a heartbeat. But it's got 18 grams of sugar in an 8.45oz can, so it would have to be a rare and decadent pleasure for me. The price per ounce is really high, too (unless you compare it to buying something from Starbuck's), so I know we could not afford to buy it very often in our household. Still, I'm giving it five stars because it tastes just plain awesome.

review/text: I've got a k-kup machine for hot coffee, but I still need my iced Cappuccino, so these cans save me a trip to Starbucks.

review/summary: Not bad but not dietetic
review/text: I was skeptical but the taste actually isn't bad. It is not a "rich expresso" taste but it is more coffee-like, and less sweet, than the bottled Starbucks Frappuccino mentioned in other reviews.<br /><br />I cannot figure out whether this is intended to be served hot, cold, or in-between. I did not see directions on the label to refrigerate it, though it does say "store in a cool, dry place." I tried it cold and lukewarm (I don't know why one would buy canned cappuccino then heat it rather than buy either a real one or the equipment to make it). The taste was acceptable either way; unlike the Starbucks drink this does not have to be refrigerated to be palatable.<br /><br />Several reviews suggest that this is low in calories. Ounce-for-ounce, though, it has about as many as Coke or Pepsi, for example (though less than the Starbucks drink). The can has "only" 100 calories because it has only 8.45 ounces.

I do like mocha, I nearly always put chocolate in any coffee I drink.<br /><br />It comes in a can rather than a bottle, so maybe that's why one reviewer mentioned a metallic taste?<br /><br />It's not as rich, nor as sweet, nor as simple (ingredient-wise) as the Starbuck's mocha in the bottle, but it's better than some other cheaper brands of canned mocha that I've tasted before.<br /><br />It's distributed by Coca-Cola, interestingly, though it's made in Denmark and the brand appears as if it's some small exotic Italian company.

review/summary: A bit weak, a bit too sweet.  It's OK.
review/text: I drink coffee every morning and am used to a strong flavor with a bit of milk or cream.  illy's Cappuccino cold coffee beverage is a pleasant and convenient alternative, although I found the taste weak and a little too sweet.  Compared to other drinks of this type, it's not as sweet nor does it appear to have as many thickeners and so it's pleasant to drink but I've yet to find a canned coffee that is excellent, this one included.  As for the coffee flavor itself, it's a warm, toasted flavor that avoids the overly roasted, burnt flavor of the industry leader -- I just wish the coffee flavor were much stronger.  If I were unable to make coffee and really needed a pick-me-up, I might drink this beverage but only in such a circumstance.

review/summary: Nice, smooth flavor
review/text: I am an iced coffee (particularly mocha flavored) connoisseur. No, I am really, really serious about it! Not the coffee shop $5 a piece kind - the ones you buy in glass bottles or cans. When I say "connoisseur", I mean drinking one almost every day for the past eight years kind of connoisseur. Having stopped drinking one popular brand, and not being able to find a substitute - I ended up resorting to blending my own. However, this completely killed the portability that I loved, as well as the ability to grab one our the fridge and head out the door.<br />Then I was asked to try this brand. Let me just say I am immediately putting this on "subscribe and save" for a monthly delivery.<br />What makes it good is its balanced flavor. You know you are drinking coffee, not chocolate milk someone put into a used coffee cup. Not black coffee some tried to flavor a bit too late with a sugar bomb. This drink is well blended and the flavors are well balanced.<br /><br />While I absolutely appreciate they kept calories down (100 calories a serving) - I think they accomplished this by using quite a few "ingredients", many I needed to look up to see exactly what they were. While they don't sound life threatening, it makes the list of ingredients twice as long as a Starbucks Frappuccino in a glass bottle (although it does have 80 less calories than the Starkbucks brand at only on ounce less drink per can)<br />coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan. Caffeine content: 81 mg<br /><br />So, if you are a person who really doesn't like a lot of chemicals or funky science going on in their food - you may be tempted to skip this one. There are other drinks one doesn't need a chemistry degree to ingest.<br /><br />With that said, the taste is smooth and balanced. I new I was drinking coffee - although it had the chocolate and milk flavors that I crave as well. I didn't get the shakes from too much caffeine and the price is reasonable compared to what you would pay in your average grocery store for similar products. Like I said, I am putting it on subscribe and save. However, I will probably still be on the lookout for iced coffee products that use more natural ingredients. It really is a good tasting product!<br /><br />Also, for those curious. This is a Cocoa-cola product that is a product of Denmark.

review/summary: A Nice, if Mild, Coffee Drink
review/text: illy's issimo Cappuccino Coffee drink, made with 100% Arabica coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, and cocoa powder, is best served over ice. I usually only drink iced coffee type drinks from my favorite local coffee cafes, and while I rarely drink canned coffee drinks, I find that they generally taste better over ice.<br /><br />I liked the balanced taste of the issimo Cappuccino Coffee drink, as it has a nice and not overly strong cocoa taste, and is not too sweet. The coffee, to me, tasted mild, although coffee is listed first in the ingredients. Each 8.45 ounce can has only 100 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 19 grams of carbohydrates, and is low in sodium, so you can drink one of these sweetened coffee drinks and not feel guilty if you are watching your waist or blood pressure.<br /><br />While I liked the drink, I expected an espresso drink to be a little stronger. Perhaps my daily trips to the neighborhood coffee chains have made me a "coffee snob," but I expected more.

There is only 100 calories per can which is good and the Cholesterol is a scant 5mg which makes it a sensible choice for someone watching their daily input.  As my title says, this is an Italian Coffee Product of Denmark distributed and produced for Coca-Cola.  I guess that makes it the king of international corporate coffee. At about $2 bucks per can I think it puts it out of my everyday coffee choice range for 9oz. Oh, yeah, heed the warning: Do Not Shake! (Don't know why)

review/text: Illy's Issimo Cappuccino drink is ok. It's not the bestcanned coffee beverage but, it's definitely not the worst.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me was the chalky aftertaste. Afterevery sip, I could feel a chalky residue on my tongue. It was not a pleasant sensation.<br /><br />The other negative aspect of the drink was the consistency.Despite the fact that milk is the second ingredient, it was very thin and watery.Somehow, I expected a thicker, creamier texture to this drink.<br /><br />The drink, however, was not all bad. The taste is decent. It'sa well-balanced blend of coffee, milk, sugar, and a touch of cocoa.<br /><br />The other positive aspect to the drink was that it wasn'ttoo sugary. Many coffee drinks are very sugary and contain a lot of calories.This drink only had 100 calories for the entire can.<br /><br />Overall, this drink won't wow you but, it's acceptable.

review/text: Comparing this to the starbucks frappucino mocha, Illy is not as good:<br /><br />Starbucks wins for the glass bottle because glass provides a smooth drinking surface and does not flavor the coffee. This aluminum can is less pleasurable to drink from and I do get a hint of metallic taste while drinking.<br /><br />Starbucks also wins for flavor. It is richer, creamier, and sweeter than Illy Cappuccino.<br /><br />Starbucks has fewer ingredients (Brewed Starbucks� Coffee (Water, Coffee), Reduced Fat Milk, Sugar, Cocoa, Pectin, Ascorbic Acid.) than Illy (100% Arabica coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder, potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, carrageenan)...<br /><br />but Starbucks has more calories (180 compared to 100) and more sugar (31grams compared to 18)-- thus the reduced flavor and creaminess.<br /><br />Illy wins for cost so if you prefer something less rich that the starbucks bottles and don't mind the aluminum can, this could be your cold coffee treat.

review/text: I always think that canned coffee has a bit of a funny (metallic?) taste and I do not think they taste as good as fresh prepared good quality coffee. That said, illy issimo cappuccino is not bad. It is not too sweet so it is hard to believe that it has 19 carbs. I think I would try one of illy's non-sweetened kinds next time. It has skim milk in it, so the color is not as "milky" as if it was cream. It has that canned coffee taste, but no unpleasant aftertaste. There are 81 mg of caffiene and 100 calories in the can according to the label. The can I had was a product of Denmark and is recyclable. Right now it is selling for a little less than two bucks a can, I think that is a bit high. I would prefer a stronger coffee taste and I don't taste the cocoa in it. I am a coffee snob, but also a coffee "addict". There are definitely times when canned coffee, such as this one are the best alternative. In those cases, this is an excellent option and I recommend it.

review/text: illy issimo Cappuccino is a fair simulation of a real cappuccino, if heated in a microwave. Real cappuccino, as I have experienced it, is much stronger and thicker and with more body. This coffee has a slightly watery flavor, with rather little coffee flavor. Its fat and calorie contents are pretty low (1.5 grams per can and 100 calories per can).<br /><br />I would probably not purchase this again as I did not like it enough to spend money on it.<br /><br />This will never substitute for a real handmade cappuccino, but might do the trick when you have no time to get to your favorite coffee shop.<br /><br />Just don't tell anyone.

With just 100 calories, it really is a reasonable splurge.  The first four listed ingredients on the can are:  coffee; low-fat milk; sugar; and cocoa powder.  The cellulose gel and gum are probably what makes this drink seem thicker--as opposed to the use of cream.<br /><br />Please note that, with 18 grams of sugar and 19 grams of carbohydrate, it may not be for those on sugar/carbohydrate restricted intake. Other than that, it contains nothing to deem it unhealthy.  It even has no preservatives. (I wonder what this drink might taste like if it were artificially sweetened and have no carbohydrates.)<br /><br />I enjoyed it ice cold straight from the can.  This tastes every bit as good as the Starbucks bottled Frapuccino coffee drinks.  I would not hesitate to choose the Illy brand over the other one.<br /><br />Coca Cola produces it in Atlanta, Georgia under a licensing agreement and it is a product of Denmark.

I do come from Louisiana where we drank cafe au lait as children though, so I do think I can tell the difference between good and bad coffee drinks.<br /><br />This illy drink is not bad, but I wouldn't say it was anything special. Tasted a little like, but not as good as, the cafe au lait I had as a child. It has a strong coffee taste which I liked, but wasn't sweet or milky enough for my taste. Guess I could have added sugar and milk, but that would defeat the purpose I guess.<br /><br />It was a little strange to drink coffee from a can, but then it has the advantage of being portable. I drank it at room temperature right out of the can. It might have been better if I heated it, but then I'd have to take it out of the can first. Some people (not me) might like it chilled.<br /><br />I think the amazon price for this product is about $2.00 for an 8.5 ounce can. Sounds a bit high to me, but compared to similar products, many people may think this is a good price.<br /><br />Give it a try if you think it is for you.

review/summary: Refreshing!
review/text: I found this to be a really nice mid-day break.  The taste was well balanced without being bitter or overly sweet.  It's very good over ice and I found it refreshing and gave me a little boost.  The only drawback would be that it is 100 calories per can, which means it isn't something I would drink everyday, but as a treat now and then, or before working out, it's perfect.  With the hotter months around the corner, this is a nice alternative to a cup of hot coffee or tea.

review/summary: good taste for the price
review/text: As a sometimes coffee drinker, I enjoy the occasional Starbucks iced coffee (or variation on that theme).  I was curious to see if illy's Cappuccino would be of similar taste.  Having seen and heard illy was a premium brand I felt a little disappointed in the taste of this drink.  Maybe it was a little too "flat" for what I am used to.  I had expected the espresso to be more bold.  The plus is that I didn't feel it was too heavy in caffeine, as the Starbucks blends tend to make me antsy if I have more than one.  For the price these are an excellent pick-me-up that pairs well with a breakfast, snack during the day or just on its own.

review/summary: Yummy!  Comparable to Tim Horton's or Starbucks...
review/text: I really enjoyed this drink.  I find it comparable to an iced cappuccino from Tim Horton's or a frappuccino from Starbucks.  I love iced coffees and I'm not always impressed by some of the lesser known brands but this is delicious.  I don't like spending a lot of money to get them from the places that I've mentioned so we make them at home from scratch quite often but this drink will now give me another option.  This drink is good and ready to go without having to make an iced cappuccino from scratch in our frappe maker.<br /><br />If you're a fan of cold cappuccino's then I'd highly recommend you to try this flavorful drink.  I'm sure you'll love it just as much as I do.

review/summary: A Pleasant Experience
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and one thing I've discovered is that there's a lot of variance in what people consider a quality beverage.  Some like it strong, some more mellow.  Some like it super sweet, others take it straight.  I generally take mine in the morning with only milk.  I use a combination of regular grind and expresso, so I tend to like strong-but-not-acidic coffee.  That doesn't keep me from downing Grande Mochas no-whip at Starbuck however.<br /><br />AND I'm telling you all this so you can judge what I say about the Illy Issimo Cappuccino drink.<br /><br />TASTE:<br />I think this product is better than bottled Starbucks.  It's a little less sweet and I prefer that.  The cocoa flavor is more subtle, while the expresso taste is more distinctive, which I also like because if I wanted chocolate flavor I'd drink chocolate milk.  What I seek is a chocolate overtone with some sweetness and this Cappuccino beverage hits the mark.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/kidlit blogger/coffee lover

It was smooth, with a very slight cocoa aftertaste. It is an italian expresso style coffee drink made with lowfat milk and cocoa.

It is delicious either way!<br /><br />Price: its expensive at $2 a can currently on Amazon. However, if all you do is buy your coffee at Starbucks, this is going to cheaper. IF YOU ARE A PRICE SHOPPER LIKE I AM, Big Lots has it cheaper and the price does change a lot here! This product is good, but your wallet is better!<br /><br />However if you do buy it, you wont regret it, as it is a really really good drink!

review/summary: Delicious energy boost
review/text: This Illy Issimo Cappuccino is a tasty cold coffee drink which comes in a 8.5 oz can.  I like the amount of sweetness (not too much, not too little), and the hint of chocolate flavor.  The mouthfeel is good: a little less thick than SB's DoubleShot.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Sweetness: 18g sugar in 8.5 oz.  Not too much nor too little.<br />- Flavor: Dominant notes are coffee, chocolate, and milk, in that order.  Pretty balanced.<br />- Size: 8.5 oz single serving is great size I think.<br />- Freshness: coffee flavor is good.  Not stale nor acidic.<br />- 100 calories is very reasonable, especially compared to many sweetened drinks you might order at an espresso bar.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Nothing major.  Would like more coffee flavor perhaps, but then again I like straight espresso.  Most people will find the coffee flavor just about right.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Use a cup or a glass - impress your friends
review/text: One reviewer said it best:  This cappuccino in a can tastes like ... well ... like a cappuccino in a can.  You are trading taste for convenience.  What I would add to that review is the following:  taste tests have proven time and time again (especially with beer) that beverages consumed out of a can often give the drinker a flavor of "tininess" ... however, since modern cans are lined with a plastic coating, this cannot be true ... the tinny flavor is actually in their head, or from the top of the can's exterior.  Further, when taste testers are served the same beer (Budweiser, Stella, Guinness, etc.) in two glasses (one poured from a can, and one poured from a bottle) they overwhelming choose the beer poured from the can.  This is because bottles leak sunlight and oxygen - two things that ruin beer.  Cans don't leak oxygen or sunlight, so a fresher, better tasting beer will always come from the can - so long as you don't drink it directly from the can.  The same is true with this product.  If you drink if from the can, you will always enjoy it less than a fresh cappuccino.  If you pour it in a cup or glass before serving it your friends will think you have a fancy machine in your kitchen.

review/text: I enjoy iced coffee drinks and prefer them strong. I put the can in the refrigerator to chill it rather than pour the drink over ice and dilute it. It had a nice, pleasant taste. Not too sweet with a nice smooth coffee taste but it didn't taste much like cappuccino.

review/summary: Very tasty coffee drink
review/text: The illy issimo is lighter than the Starbucks Frappacino and I ended up liking it quite a bit more.  The can is pressurized so make sure not to shake before opening (it warns you on the can but I missed this warning at 6am in the morning the first time I drank this and made a huge mess).<br /><br />The drink is 100 calories a can and does not have any artificial sweetener which is great.  It is lightly sweet, but not overly so.  It has a fairly creamy texture but is more watery than the Starbucks Frappacino.<br /><br />I really like this drink and it has become my mainstay.  I like that it is lighter than the Starbucks version and only has 100 calories.  The can is slim and easy to hold and drink while driving.<br /><br />It is a little pricey to buy this through Amazon; I can get it at my local Target for about $1 a can.  Highly recommended for those who like this sort of canned sweet coffee drink.

review/summary: The illy issimo Cappuccino Tastes Sweeter and Creamier than the illy issimo Caff&egrave;, but Starbucks is Still Better!
review/text: Because I barely average six hours of sleep each night, I need a lot of coffee to keep me going throughout the day.  I love iced coffee during the warm summer months.  Many of the fast food chains are providing it.  Coca-Cola is now selling coffee in the can.  The illy issimo Cappuccino, manufactured by Coca-Cola, is much sweeter than the illy issimo Caff&egrave; [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Coffee Drink, Caff&egrave;, 6.8-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].  The Cappuccino has a lot more sugar and milk than the Caff&egrave;, which is basically black coffee.  However, the Cappuccino still pales in comparison to other leading brands.  I have posted photographs of illy issimo Cappuccino alongside its leading competitors: Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy + Coffee Drink, Mocha [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002U56LE2">Starbucks Doubleshot, Energy+Coffee Drink, Mocha, 15 oz (Pack of 12)</a>], and Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBVJI">Java Monster Coffee + Energy Drink, Loca Moca, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>].<br /><br />  I enjoy the sweet, creamy taste of illy issimo Cappuccino straight from its can or sipping it from a glass full of ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  However, it doesn't taste as delicious as the Starbucks Doubleshot.  (See my posted photograph.)  When compared to Starbucks and Java, the liquid in the glass is still darker than the others.  (See posted photograph.)  I don't think Starbucks has to worry about losing customers to Coca-Cola.  I'd rather go to the grocery store and buy coffee drinks manufactured by Starbucks instead of illy issimo.<br /><br />  Also, I don't quite understand why the cans of illy issimo say, "Do Not Shake."  I posted a photograph of a glass bottle of Starbucks Frappuccino Mocha [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha, 9.5 Ounce Bottles-(pack of 12)</a>]; one can see that its contents have settled at the bottom.  I always shake my bottles and cans of coffee drinks before opening them.  The contents have never spewed like carbonated soda; instead, they have appeared slightly frothy.  However, I just remembered from looking at the ingredients (which I have posted on this website) that both illy issimo Caff&egrave; and illy issimo Cappuccino have potassium bicarbonate.  Perhaps the potassium bicarbonate will cause the coffee to spew if shaken.  Why do these products contain potassium bicarbonate?  Commonly found in club soda, potassium bicarbonate softens the affects of effervescence.  It is also used as a fire suppression agent ("BC dry chemical") in some dry chemical fire extinguishers.<br /><br />  Illy issimo Cappuccino is recommended for coffee drinkers who love sugar and cream in their coffee but think Starbucks has too much in their products.  Perhaps you are a long-term consumer of Starbucks products and you desire something different; illy issimo Cappuccino would be worth trying for a change.  I wonder if the Coca-Cola Museum in Atlanta, Georgia, will be offering free samples of the illy issimo coffee drinks.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos

It tastes like chocolate milk with only a faint coffee flavor, and it has a cardboardy aftertaste. I drank it straight from the can, chilled, as most people probably would after buying it from a convenience store or from a vending machine. I'm going to stick with the other flavor, but maybe someone who prefers a milder, more cocoa/milk than coffee flavor might prefer this.

review/summary: Illy Issimo Coffee Drinks
review/text: I received both the Caffe and Cappuccino versions and did a side-by-side taste comparison to see which of the two I might prefer over the other.<br /><br />First I tried the Caffe version and was surprised to discover it was just black coffee. I prefer cream in my coffee, so I was hesitant to taste it as it was. But I tasted it and found it to have a nice medium coffee strength with a bit of sweetness to it. In my everyday coffee I don't add sugar, but on occasion it's nice to have a special coffee drink, and since it's been hot here lately, I had poured it over ice as well. I added cream and found it to be quite enjoyable. It's one of those conveniences that one could easily become addicted to.<br /><br />Next I tried the Cappuccino which had a similar taste and flavor as the Caffe, but was milder. I prefer my coffee stronger, so my preference was for the Caffe and still I would have liked it stronger (perhaps this is offered in another version). But the Cappuccino was also good and I had poured it over ice as well. I was concerned about both coffees being packaged in cans as I don't like my drinks to have a metallic tinge to them, but I did not notice anything out of the ordinary. I had, however, poured the drinks over ice into a glass, so that may have helped. Regardless, it was really nice to have sitting out on my deck on a warm day. Hot coffee just does not sit well with me in hot weather.<br /><br />All-in-all, if you're looking for a mild, sweet coffee drink that's quick and easy to take with you on the go or to pour into a glass at home, this is a good choice. It's small and convenient to slip into a purse or briefcase. While the coffee is mild, it still gives a quick pick-me-up in the morning, or in the middle of the day if need be.

review/summary: Good Prepackaged Coffee Drink, Maybe not up to the Illy name
review/text: I've had a few other coffee drinks that come in a can, with milk + coffee, and they kind of all have the same taste.  This illy branded one is no different.  It's a unique flavor.  Somewhat like iced coffee with milk, but still different.  I enjoy the flavor, but it's not going to be like drinking an iced mocha coffee with cream/milk from your local cafe.<br /><br />I would compare this closely to some of the Java Monster energy drinks that I've had, more specifically the Mocha version of it.  The difference being that here you only get 8.45 ounces instead of the 16+ oz of the monster, and you're only getting coffee here with no additional craziness, which is good.<br /><br />I haven't had illy coffee that much, just a few times in Europe, and then some espresso pods for a cheap espresso machine I had, so I can't really fully say if it lives up to the name, but it was smooth coffee, albeit with chocolate and milk mixed in as well.  I'm not sure the price justifies how much you get, or the name on it in this case.

review/summary: Best served over ice.
review/text: I compare this to drinks I've had from Starbucks and Java Monster, and I have to say that this one is the most delicate taste, has the least aftertaste, and best serving size. The downsides are that the calories per ounce are quite a bit higher than the other options, and the mouth texture feels a bit oily or emulsified if you don't drink it over ice.<br /><br />If wanting the overall best experience, surprisingly I would reach for the Java Monster-- best value, taste and calorie per ounce ratio. For the most aggressive coffee taste, I choose the Starbucks. And for the least aftertaste, and quick on the go drink, I choose this one.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee expert, so I'm not sure if that emulsified or egg white emulsified mouth experience is normal or expected, but for me, if that could be minimized or eliminated I would really appreciate this product more. I rated 3 stars out of 5 because of the emulsified mouth experience and the less desirable calories per ounce.

Just thr tigh balance of sweetness, coffee, and creaminess (it's milk).<br /><br />While the convenience is great, for the price, I'd rather get an iced latte at my local coffee place. The serving size is fairly small (basically the same size as 3/4s can of soda- which is pretty small for a coffee drink if you're a fan), as well. But the portability is pretty great- it'd be good for grabbing on a hurry or if you're headed out to a picnic or some sort of day out somewhere and need to bring your coffee with you. If the price were lower, I'd definitely keep a few of these stashed in the fridge, but for now, I'll continue to get my coffee up the road.

review/text: I did not like the taste of this Illy cappuccino drink.  I like coffee and coffee drinks in general, and I was looking forward to trying something new, but this product had a slight metallic/chemical aftertaste that, while not strong, was present in sufficient strength to make it less than pleasing to me.  I much prefer the Starbucks Mocha Cappuccino drink that tastes only of coffee, milk, sugar and chocolate.  I do not know if it is the metal container that imparts the aftertaste to the Illy product.  The similar Starbucks drink comes in a glass container that I suppose could have something to do with its fresher taste.  Also, since my opinion is certainly subjective, others may like the Illy drink and be just as justified in their opinion.

review/text: I love this beverage.  It's a good coffee flavor with detectable cream.  It's not too strong or roasty, which is a problem with some coffee beverages in cans.  It also has a faint 'burnt sugar' taste.  Burnt sugar is a recipe that my family has used in pies for generations, and it's made me addicted to this product.  I also can't taste the can at all, which is a pet peeve of mine.<br /><br />The fluid had some substance to it.  I'm not sure how to express this clearly, but it was slightly thick in a highly pleasing way.<br /><br />I think the 8 ounce size is good and this gave me a convenient afternoon kick so I could get to work in a good mood.<br /><br />It's really good if it's really cold, so I stick it in the freezer for a short while before drinking.

review/summary: Not A Product I Would Go Out OF My Way To Buy
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this product was the admonition not to shake it....this is plastered around the top of the can in four places and I thought it odd, as it is not carbonated and it would make sense that shaking it would emulsify the flavors within.<br /><br />My first reaction to my first two sips were that it was somewhat watery and that it had a bitter aftertaste that reminded me of burnt coffee. There was a light sweetness with a hint of dairy present. As I drank more, it began to get better. The watery taste diminished and it took on a more consistent, smoother flavor and the aftertaste seemed to diminish.<br /><br />While I will still get my iced coffee drinks form a chain of doughnut shops when I am not in California and in an area that has them, I would drink this in a pinch. It's just not something I would go out of my way to buy, unless there was nothing else to be had. Oh, and by the way, try shaking this before you drink it. I can't see what it would hurt....but it could really help!

review/text: Really great coffee! I don't usually get cold coffee like this, just because it is way too sweet. Like the Starbucks ones I never get them too sweet, and you can't taste the coffee. This one has the right amount of sugar, and you can taste the coffee.

review/summary: 3 1/2 Stars -- Okay But Nothing Special!
review/text: Prior to opening the illy issimo Cappucino flavored Coffee Drink I had some reservations about how much like cappucino this canned drink would be, both in taste and consistency. After drinking it, my reservations were well founded.<br /><br />I found the product's taste to be pretty good but nothing special. Tastewise, it had a mild coffee and cocoa taste with an acceptable level of sweetness. However, as to its resemblance to what I'm used to in a cappucino, the drink is somewhat lacking both in taste and consistency. The drink's coffee flavor is too light/mild and its consistency too watery to be a good cappucino.<br /><br />Overall, while I didn't dislike the illy issimo Cappucino flavored Coffee Drink, it is unlikely that at Amazon's price of over $2 for an 8.45 oz can I will be buying it any time soon.

review/summary: This caffeine addict approves, so does his wife
review/text: My wife ran across this specific brand in Japan last year and said it was every bit as good as the canned Starbucks competitor and a lot cheaper (check prices). I refrigerated this and my wife and I split it. We're daily AM quadruple espresso drinkers, and this was spot on. She usually has her coffee with sweetener, and I like mine bitter and black. We found this to be really nice and pleasant in-between sweetness that we both liked. Nothing additional was added. Cold, unshaken, right out of the can.<br /><br />My rule when I get free stuff to review: Would I buy this with my own money? My answer: yes. We're going on an upcoming vacation in the wilds of Northern Wisconsin and I'm getting a case of this, as well as a case of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001R1RWRU">illy issimo, Caffe Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink</a> which I've also reviewed. This product and the Illy espresso are perfect for a couple of caffeine addicts.

review/summary: Very pleasurable
review/text: After taking a taste of this, I had  two sons weigh in on the Illy Issimo Coffee Drink (we split the can). I drank the majority of the relatively thin and compact can but they had tiny sips as well. We all loved this beverage. We were already familiar with the wonderful coffees (both whole and ground) made by Illy Issimo. So I was curious to see how this new addition to their line would hold up.<br /><br />If you like a very dark roast flavor, you should know that this cappucino flavor is more on the light side, similar to coffee with some cream and sugar. The sweetness is not overpowering and thankfully  doesn't match the sickening, cloying sweetness of so many canned drinks and sodas. And, after researching the brand, I discovered that this was indeed a goal - to create a refreshing coffee drink without only a touch of sweetness. I think they succeeded admirably.<br /><br />At 100 calories a can, this is an easy treat to fit into a diet plan and isn't just sugar and fizz but has added milk - so as treats go, this is a reasonable option.  Hate added preservatives? You won't find those, either. You will find caffeine, however, so look for the caffeine-free versions if you can't handle the extra buzz and energy. They are readily available.<br /><br />If you're driving for a few hours or across country, these are ideal for taking along because they take up so little space. They might even help you stay awake just a bit longer than you might otherwise.

review/summary: YUM!!! From a serious coffee lover!
review/text: It's probably apparent by my user name but I really really (REALLY) like coffee. From my first taste of it as a child growing up in Miami (our cuban next door neighbor gave me a cup of coffee con leche with the warning that I wouldn't like it...I LOVED IT!) to this very day, everything about coffee appeals to me. The aroma, the flavor...even the process of brewing a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, I usually buy organic whole beans and grind my own by hand just before making. I prefer a french press but have probably owned most forms of making coffee ever invented...sometimes the most simple is the best. Why do I mention this? Because I rarely - if ever - drink instant coffee, drip brewed regular household names etc...I find the taste lacking immensely. The only regular coffee I purchase from the store is Bustelo...yes, back to my original coffee roots!<br /><br />In any case, I was curious about this and opted to give it a try. Vine users receive 1 can which I was forced to split between myself and the spouse...we both agreed, it was delicious! No odd aftertaste, no harsh chemical flavoring, not too sweet (a common problem) and the coffee flavor was present but not overpowering.<br /><br />Bottom line...we both liked it! Now, being rather health conscious, I'd prefer an organic option however, this is kosher (a major consideration for us) as well as free from preservatives AND uses the higher quality arabica beans rather than robusta...compared to a soda or even loaded up coffee alternative at a local Starbucks, this is a great option/alternative. Wonderful to take along anywhere especially when you can't stop and prepare a full pot of real coffee during the day.

review/summary: Real Coffee Drinkers Drink
review/text: My new favorite iced coffee drink from the grocery store.  Distinctly different from the popular Starbucks cold drinks from the grocery store.  The illy drink is a lot less sweet than all others I have tried.  Has a much more distinct coffee taste which I really liked.  The milk/cream part of it was also muted again allowing the coffee taste to come out.  This tasted much more like an iced coffee drink that would be appreciated by those that actually really like the taste of coffee and not the sweet dairy flavor of many of the popular drinks in the grocery store.

review/summary: delicious coffee drink!
review/text: Illy issimo's Cappucino Coffee drink is pretty good. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but when I do have a mug, I add lots of sugar and creamer to it to hide the bitterness of the coffee. This drink tastes pretty much like how I like my coffee, except it is cold. The sweetness is there however it does not hide the coffee flavor--it is still strong and stands out. If you like your coffee black or without milk/creamer, you probably would not like this. However, if you prefer sweet coffee drinks like me, I would reccommend it to you.<br /><br />Overall, it is a delicious coffee drink that I would buy myself if it wasn't so expensive.

review/summary: (3.5 stars) A medium-body, moderate-calorie coffee drink
review/text: The illy issimo Cappucino coffee drink is a well-made, medium-body and moderate calorie drink.  It's produced in Denmark and imported.  It has 100 calories and 1.5 grams of fat in an 8.45 ounce drink.<br /><br />A bottled Starbucks Coffee Frappucino has 200 calories and 3 grams of fat (and it's slightly larger at 9.5 ounces), so the illy drink offers a lighter alternative if that's what you're seeking.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer a stronger coffee flavor, and am not as concerned about the calories.  For a pick-me-up, I often want some calories as well as caffeine.  I found the illy drink pleasant, and it's probably right for some, but most of the time I'd probably buy something else.<br /><br />The label mentions that it has cocoa, so I was looking for the flavor, but it didn't seem to me to have much if any cocoa flavor.  Since I don't really want that in a cappucino drink anyway, that's actually a plus.  But if you're looking for a mocha flavor, try something else.

review/summary: Do you like your Cappuccino sweet?
review/text: This is one of those slim cans (8.45 oz) that have become ubiquitous in convenience stores, and now in grocery stores as well.  I've bought my share of Starbucks cans, but this is my first experience with Illy.<br /><br />Cappuccino that I've drunk tends to be pretty intense, and not super-sweet and creamy like this stuff.  So it's far sweeter than I was expecting.  I decided to try and figure out how much sugar was in there, and it comes out to about 7.5% of the entire thing is sugar.  It is, at least, fairly rich-tasting considering low-fat milk is involved.<br /><br />Comparable to the Starbucks products, this is a pretty good refreshing can of sweet, cold, slightly chocolaty "cappuccino".  Note that it contains 81 mg of caffeine.  Your typical No-Doz tablet is 200 mg of caffeine.  If you're looking for the caffeine, that is, and don't want calories, that's a good thing to know....

review/summary: Tastes more like chocolate milk
review/text: I like coffee, and I am particularly a huge fan of anything mocha-flavored, so I was excited to try this drink.  I expected it to be similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018AIZKS">Starbucks Coffee Frappuccino Coffee Drink Mocha</a>, which I find to be quite yummy (although high in calories).<br /><br />To me, this cappuccino-flavored drink tasted more like chocolate milk.  Although coffee is the first ingredient listed on the can, I personally found the coffee flavor to be quite subtle, perhaps because I was expecting something stronger from a product labelled "Italian Espresso Style Coffee Drink."  So, in that respect, I was somewhat disappointed.  In addition, there is quite a bit of added sugar in this drink:  18 grams, or over 3 teaspoons.  On the plus side, the product is made with low-fat milk, so there are only 1.5 grams of fat and 100 calories, not bad for flavored coffee.<br /><br />Personally, I would rate this drink at 3 1/2 stars, as the flavor wasn't quite to my liking.  But if you really like the taste of chocolate milk and want a bit of caffeine kick to go along with it (there are 81 m.g. of caffeine per serving), then this Cappuccino Coffee Drink may be right for you.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I was sent this illy issimo Caffe Coffee Drink in Cappuccino flavor by Amazon Vine for review. Here's my take on it.<br /><br />I love good strong coffee, lattes and cappuccino. I did not love this drink. I was looking for a strong coffee taste. Instead I got a diluted drink with a noticeable low-fat taste and a somewhat unusual aftertaste. The chocolate flavor was non-existent, the low-fat milk flavor overpowering. Perhaps chilled over ice would improve the drinking experience, but I'm not interested enough to try another can.<br /><br />On the good side: the beverage contains only 100 calories. However, this is offset by the bad: 18 grams of sugar.

review/text: ~<br />This would be a great coffee drink to grab out of the refrigerator at home, but at about $2 for 8.45 ounces, this beverage is just so-so.<br /><br />After chilling in the refrigerator overnight, I pulled the tab on the tall and slim can of illy issimo cappuccino, and it smelled terrific: a light coffee and chocolate scent. I poured half of it in a small glass, and gave the other half to my teen-aged son (who loves coffee drinks). We both had the same good/bad opinion: The good part - It has a nice mix of coffee/cocoa taste, a little too sweet, but not bad. The bad part - You can definitely taste a tin-y flavor within the mix.<br /><br />All-in-all, not a bad drink, but not one the either of us would look for and purchase specifically, especially for the price.

review/text: Illy is a top coffee brand in Italy, so I was eager to try their pre-packaged cappuccino. It had an enticing aroma, but that's where the enticement ended. This drink tastes of sweetener with the merest hint of cocoa, but no hint at all of coffee. Nor did it taste anything like cappuccino. Puzzling but true. The convenience of popping open a can is nice, but I'll continue to make cappuccino at home using my little stove top espresso pot and a frother for the milk.

review/text: Illy Issimo Cappucino is an exceedingly rich, quite sweet, cappuccino drink that is an Italian espresso style coffee drink with low fat milk and cocoa. While I love its very sweet flavor, I thought it needed some improvement by diluting it 50% with fresh milk. I am surprised that a drink as rich as this one is has only 100 calories per can; it's also low sodium too with only 60 milligrams per can. Anyone who is diet conscious will appreciate both salient facts. This is truly a cocoa and cappuccino lover's delight of a drink. I highly recommend it.

review/text: I tasted this product, and all I can say is yecch!  I'm normally the type who loves a cold cappuccino drink, whether I get it from the store or at one of the local coffee shops, but illy issimo's Cappuccino Coffee drink had a bitter, metallic taste that I have never experienced in other store-bought cappuccinos.  It might be just me, but I would strongly suggest that in the future the makers of this drink rework the mixture and find some way to treat the cans so that this product doesn't come out with a metallic, bitter flavor such as what I experienced when I drank it.

review/text: I tried this cold initially, and then I took a shot at heating it up. It was better once it was warm, but still not so good that I think it'll ever be something that I'd go out and buy. I think it was a little too milky and overly sweetened.<br /><br />The nutritional values certainly aren't the worst that you can do for a drink of the type. In that area it's relatively good even. Something that isn't sweetened with sugar at all is preferable, of course. Specifying non-GMO or organic sugar would be something of an improvement. Still, if you're going to drink something sugar-sweetened, you can surely do worse.<br /><br />Anyway, I personally tried it two different ways to see if I could make it a little more enjoyable. I ended up deciding the coffee element wasn't strong enough to be worth it to me, and I ended up deciding not to finish the one can I had. I don't see myself going out and getting more any time soon.

review/text: I don't normally like chilled coffee, ive tried the bottled coffee from Starbucks but its so sweet. However when I saw this coffee offered through the Vine program I thought I'd give it a try. Its really good, way better then I was expecting by far. It has a nice flavor without being overly sweet. Made with low fat milk and cocoa, it does have 81mg/8.45fl oz of caffeine content I can tell for sure. The drink came me nice clean energy with no crash and was much easier on my stomach then normal coffee with store bought cream. Only 100 calories per can which is nice the carbs are 19g along with 18grams of sugar. Recently ive been very obsessed withe expiration dates so I got this product on march 20th 2012 and it expires August 11th 2012 so roughly 5 months but it doesn't have any preservatives so that's not to bad.. Love that its on subscribe and save so instead of $23.19 its only 19.71 so it makes them roughly $1.62 a piece and that's a pretty decent price. Ive recently decided to try Weight Watchers and this drink is 2 points, so also not to bad.. Overall I think its a great beverage and I highly recommend it!

I was trying to get more Shock Triple Mocha but I can never seem to find them any more so I bought these instead... these are very good and I would buy these if I can't get Seattle's Best Mocha Iced Coffee which is my second favorite next to Shock, and are usually easily available in my area.

I liked that it wasn't as sweet as say some<br />Starbuck's products since I don't take regular coffee with any sweeteners.

review/summary: Surprisingly good
review/text: I grew up drinking my coffee black and have never been big on all the new variations of coffee drinks.  Personally, I often find them to be oversweetened or just over elaborate.  But this illy Capuccino had a far more subdued taste than one might fear, especially in a canned drink.  It didn't make me a convert but will certainly do in a pinch.

And, the milk is hormone free milk.<br /><br />The flavor is rich, no metal after taste, and the coffee tastes fresh.<br /><br />I love having these for when I'm running late, and with teenagers in the house, it's a great drink for them to grab before their summer job!

review/summary: Not Much of a Cappuccino Flavor
review/text: Illy makes great coffee and I did enjoy the taste of this beverage. But buys should beware that what they're getting when they order this product is not so much a Cappuccino, but a regular slightly flavored can of coffee. This did not taste like an iced cappucino.<br /><br />Whether you choose to purchase this product is likely based on your preference for canned coffee. I can tell you that illy excels at the canned coffee product. Their coffee does not taste artificial or fake, like many of the other products. I cannot drink the Starbucks Double Shot espresso without gagging and that largely put me off the stuff. I'm not sure if I'll continue drinking this stuff, but it wasn't bad.<br /><br />Canned coffee is expensive if you consider how cheap and relatively easy it is to make iced coffee. But if you're a believer in canned coffee, you'll probably like the taste of this one. Even if it's not really Cappuccino, at least it tastes good.

review/summary: Smooth 100 Calorie canned Cappuccino!  Nice surprise!
review/text: I would never have tried this brand through VINE had others not told me it was their new preferred brand of Canned Cappucino and now I see why.  it's 100 Calories and has a nice smooth taste with no bitter, overbrewed or over-roasted flavor you can sometimes get with Chain shop Cappuccinos, Frappuccinos or iced Lattes.  The sugar is a little bit strong at 18 grams for the 8.45 ounce can but overall, that's low in comparison to many competing brands.  It's got a nice strong cofee taste and hint of chocolate which is strong enough to add to some ice and blend if you want to cut your sugar intake and economize by using half a can at a time.<br /><br />Unlike their Canned Espresso, this item does have some thickening agents like Carageenan (a seeweed extract used the way Chia seed glop is used to thicken) and Cellulose Gum which is a plant fiber derived thickening agent.  But most canned Cappuccinos have these and usually higher on the list. It's likely there because they opted for lowfat milk.  The thickeners are liekly to make up for the lack of Milkfat.  Since they're common food addtives and not something I don't ordinarily get in most prepraed foods, I'm not bothered by it.  In fact, itheir ingredient list is quite short compared to some manufacturers' canned of bottled Cappuccino drinks.  At least they don't add oil to it!  As for the Cafeine load - Issimo has 81 Mgs of Caffeine which is still less than 2 Excedrin tablets so that's not a huge amount of caffeine by comparison.<br /><br />I enjoyed this and will likely use it as my new canned Cappucino option.  The price is comperable to my old brand and cheaper than others. As far as the sugar issue goes, I'll likely drink half a can at a time and blend it with ise since that's the way I like my Cappucinos.  I won't be missing the line at Starbucks or all the added calories.  This way, I can choose what I add to my Cappuccino and my waistline!

review/summary: Good coffee flavor, but fails in nutrition
review/text: The chief benefit of illy issimo's canned iced coffee drinks is that they make iced coffee easily portable. You can throw it in a bag and not worry about leakage. And for a pre-made canned drink, the coffee flavor is better than I expect.<br /><br />Nutrition wise, it's pretty similar to a can of regular Coke: About the same amount of calories per ounce (11.8); slightly less sugar per ounce (2.13); but substantially more sodium (7.1mg/ounce vs Coke's 3.25mg/ounce -- wow!).<br /><br />illy is simply doing something wrong when they've added so much sweetening to coffee that they've essentially turned it into soda.

review/text: illy issimo Coffee Drink, Cappuccino, tastes great but nothing spectacular. The taste is something similar you would get from your local starbucks. By strength, it is in the middle of the pack but by sweetness, it rates way up. This is the only drawback I could think of with this coffee drink, sugar is rated at 10mg in an 8.45-oz can. For those of you who are trying to cut down on sugar, this might not be a healthy alternative. But as far as taste is concerned, it is good for a chilled coffee beverage. Its just not something I would be drinking on a daily basis.

I was eager to try their new cappuccino drink, and I'm sorry to report that it was a big disappointment to me. The Red Bull-size can contained a coffee that tasted somewhat stale and too sweet and creamy, with an aftertaste of plastic. I would probably drink a bottle of Starbucks cappuccino before I pick up one of these, and I hate Starbucks cappuccino... Very disappointing.

They won't replace your favorite coffee stop on the way when you have the time but they are good enough to have found a niche in the market.

review/text: If you like your coffee to taste full bodied, lightly sweet and not bitter, this is a good choice for icing.  However, if you require the full caffeine hit, pass this by.  A regular cuppa has about 20 mg more caffeine, and for those who need that full amount in the morning, this just won't cut it.  The price is a bit high per can, but depending on what you spend at starbucks or other coffee houses, it might not seem bad to you.  Better than other canned brands, and the flavor of the coffee shines through the sweetness, which i personally enjoy.

review/summary: Just My Cappuccino.....
review/text: I tried this product at the same time I got illy issimo's Caffe flavored Coffee Drink.  The Cappuccino is much more my speed.  The Caffe flavor is "black", just an espresso drink with no dairy in it.<br /><br />This one the other hand reminds me of an iced coffee drink you might find in Dunkin or Starbucks.  It actually tastes very similar to those brands Mocha / Cappuccino flavored cold drinks, but not as sweet.  Now, in general I do have a sweet tooth, but I prefer this drink over the more heavily sweetened drinks from Starbucks and Dunkin.<br /><br />It has a definite coffee flavor but it is a mild flavor.  This drink is much darker out of the can than the other brands I mention, and I found it a bit less enjoyable 'straight', but over ice and with a splash of skim milk (or whole milk if you prefer) it really tasted great.<br /><br />Now, why, you may ask, would I rate something high if I have to add an ingredient to make it taste better?  I am a coffee drinker, but not a hard code iced coffee drinker.  I love a nice Dunkin Mocha Chiller, but at the same time I know those are heavily sweetened and taste more like a shake than a coffee.  So to me this is a great compromise.  I can drink it as is and like it, or quick it a slight dash of milk and it really is fantastic.

review/summary: Canned Coffee Not My Thing -- Apparently
review/text: Better than no coffee at all is faint praise indeed, and that is what I feel about the cappucino I just drank. Because I had consumed an Italian Espresso style drink by the same company at room temperature a few days ago, I decided to chill the cappuccino to see if I liked it any better than the tepid espresso. The only difference I could detect was that the cappuccino was slightly sweeter but still had a bitter, metallic aftertaste not improved by chilling. If I were taking a trip to some isolated place where I could not expect to have coffee every morning, I might take the cappucino along for emergency rations, but otherwise, no. And I still do not understand why both cans have instructions not to shake the product.

review/text: Blah, yuk pa-too-ee! This taste like a two day old cup of coffee that's been left in the microwave. No kidding! When the weather starts getting hot I don't drink that much coffee so I only need to make a fresh pot every other day or so. My morning routine, like most people, usually starts with looking for a cup of coffee. If there's any in the pot left over from yesterday I'll nuke a cup. depending on how much is left in the pot I might make a fresh one. Well, this tastes a lot like two day old coffee that's been warmed up in the micro wave, forgot about, and found the next morning. Blah Yuky pucky too-ey! Oh, just FYI, when I make a fresh pot of coffee, after its finished dripping I turn the burner off so it doesn't sit there and cook for two hours. Then when I want a cup I warm it up in the microwave and it tastes pretty close to fresh. Its at least better this way then letting it sit there cooking for two hours first and it saves on coffee. These days it cost too much to throw away half a pot when I don't have to.<br /><br />Since I've never had one of these before I wasn't too sure what to expect but I kinda thought it would have a more creamy feel and taste to it and a little sweeter. It mostly taste like a two day old cup of cold coffee. Actually a two day old cup of MY coffee taste's a lot better. A lot of others seem to like this but I'll pass on it.

review/text: If by `ill' you mean `happy', the same way that `bad' can mean `good'.<br /><br />See how I flipped that?<br /><br />;-)<br /><br />ANYWAYS...I love iced coffee.  It makes me happy.  I especially love the whole sweetened almost dessert essence of the new-age coffee house delicacies thanks in large part to the booming business of Starbucks and obviously trickling down into so many `other' cafes, like Maui Wowi (which I recently discovered thanks to a quick trip to H.E.B.).  So, I am far from opposed to downing one of these canned coffee drinks because, above all else, they are `coffee drinks', not coffee and when one actually pops the top and tips it back, that is what they should be expecting.  If you take a sip expecting an actual cappuccino then you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  But, if you look at this `illy' drink as yet another in the vein of the Starbucks bottled drinks then you are sure to be happy with the result.  It is sweet with the right hint of coffee flavor.<br /><br />Sadly, I don't really get cappuccino at all (they could have developed that distinct flavor a little more) but at the end of the day it is pretty tasty and has none of the aftertaste of artificial sweetener that can rear its head in drinks like this.<br /><br />Some balk at the price, but $2 a can really isn't that surprising.  I mean, it's the perfect dose and it isn't any more expensive than brand name products in the same wheelhouse.  I may not reach for this every time I need a coffee, but I'm not opposed to throwing one back from time to time.

I took what left-over coffee was in pot from this morning (about the same amount as in the illy issimo coffee can), added about 2 tablespoons of fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 cream, one tablespoon of Nestle instant chocolate milk powder (non-sugar), and about 3/4 of a tablespoon of Splenda.  I stirred it up, added crushed ice and VOILA!!!  I had nearly created the same thing as what's in this can of Cappuccino coffee, and with a lot fewer calories.  It really is very similar in texture, color and flavor as what you get in the can.  Of course, the can is lot less trouble, but then it's a lot more expensive.<br /><br />Anyway, this stuff is really good and if I had married a millionaire I would buy a warehouse full of it.

review/summary: Absolutely Great for Travel
review/text: Having tried many types of canned coffee, I have to say this was pretty yummy.  But then I understand that "taste" is very subjective.  So why did I give this 5 stars?<br /><br />1) Its small.  Very small.  You can but it in a bag or purse and not notice its there.  I will use these when traveling, for sure.  Space is the issue here folks!<br /><br />2) The Ingredients are: Coffee (100% Arabica), Lowfat Milk, Sugar, Cocoa Powder, Potassium Bicarbonate, Cellulose Gel, Potassium Citrate, Cellulose Gum, Carrageenan.  You will expect to get these in all canned coffees.<br /><br />3)  It is 8.45 fl ounces, has 100 Calories, 1.5 g fat, 4 grams of protein, 19 carbs.  Its like a little meal in a can.<br /><br />4) Tastes better than any of the other coffees out there, including canned Starbucks.

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!
review/text: I went to Rome, Italy a few years back.  Coffee drinking over there comes natural and one can choose so many different ways to have their coffee prepared in nice, small family owned coffee shops. "Illy" is a well known brand there.  Once I came back to US, it was only specialty and gourmet stores that carried this brand of coffee.  I was unable to find it in regular grocery stores.<br /><br />I am delighted to find out that Amazon is offering this product to their customers.  My cappuccino coffee was made with natural arabica beans ans had low fat milk and cocoa in it. It comes in nice, slim aluminum can that is easy to pack and carry.  Drink has 100 calories, but it is worth every one of them.  Taste is fabulous and I drank mine cold.<br /><br />I will definitely add this product on my shopping list, whenever possible.

review/summary: Tasty coffee beverage, but overly sweet
review/text: I like to have a few cold canned coffee beverages on hand, as I prefer them to most energy drinks. Unfortunately finding one that isn't filled with sweeteners has become very difficult.  Living in the Seattle area I was already familiar with illy for their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYUI">coffee beans</a> that are used in some of my favorite coffee houses. So being given the chance to try some of their canned coffee beverage was something I was looking forward to.<br /><br />After spending the night in the fridge, I opened the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEVJRY">illy issimo Cappuccino</a> without shaking it as noted on the can and poured it into a glass. (*See customer images) The color was good with just a hint of dairy. The smell was nice too, but from that I could already detect the sweetness that I was about to taste.  The coffee was strong and smooth, but overpowered by the sugar.  After half the glass, I couldn't drink any more and offered the rest to my daughter who enjoyed it.<br /><br />Overall illy issimo has a great product, but like many canned coffee makers they overdo it on the sugar. I would much prefer the coffee be the focus of beverage with just a hint of sweetness if they feel the need to add it.<br /><br />*For those not interested in the overly sweet drinks like me, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IEZJMA">illy issimo Caff&egrave;</a>. It's a much better option than the cappuccino version. Good flavor, but no dairy and not as sweet.

review/summary: The BEST pre-made coffee product I've ever tasted!
review/text: I used to drink any old coffee, and then a local coffee place turned me into a snob. Now anything that comes in a bottle or can and calls itself coffee tastes overly processed, too artificial, and usually overwhelmingly sweet. Not so for this one!<br /><br />I'll be buying these to have on hand when I don't have time to make coffee at home or when I need something on the go. At 100 calories, it's not much of an indulgence, though it has more sugar than I'd like (18g in 1 can). I like that the first four ingredients are the main things I would normally have in my espresso drinks: coffee, lowfat milk, sugar, cocoa powder (and then others I can't pronounce: potassium bicarbonate, cellulose gel, potassium citrate, cellulose gum, caaragennan). Overall, I'm impressed.<br /><br />One note on the flavor: I think this has a little too much milk to it to call it a cappucino, though not quite enough to be a latte. Regardless of what you call it, though, IT'S GOOD! :)
