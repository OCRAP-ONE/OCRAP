review/summary: Our Favorite Popcord
review/text: We like the much harder to find "white" popcorn over the more common "yellow" popcorn and Amish Country Baby White is our absolute favorite.  We usually order 3 of the 6 lb bags 'cause we go thru it so quickly.

review/text: This is the best popcorn i have ever ate. I use a Whirley Popper to pop my popcorn. When you eat this baby white hulless you will never go back to any other popcorn. I gave my Orville Redenbacher's  and Walmart popcorn away..To many husks. You just can't beat this popcorn. It tastes sooooo good even my puppy loves it.

review/summary: Amish Baby White Popcorn
review/text: I first had this popcorn at my 84 year old cousin's home. I thought it was so tender and delicious, and I wanted to buy some for myself. I found it on Amazon.com believe it or not!!!  Anyway, I ordered 6 pounds of it. All 6 pounds are now gone. This popcorn is REALLY good. It is different than other popcorns I have eaten because the kernels are small and very delicate. I consider myself a pro when it comes to popcorn because I have eaten it every night since I was a little girl. I usually eat my popcorn 1 kernel at a time, but since the kernels are so small, I ate it by the handful. My only complaint is that it does cost a lot to have it shipped. I wish I could find it locally so I would not have to pay for the shipping costs. If you like popcorn, I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Very good popocorn
review/text: My doctor told me I must eat "hulless" popcorn if I have popcorn at all.  Because I can't give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don't think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don't get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore.

review/text: Wish I would have read the reviews that discuss the product's performance in hot air poppers.  The PC is very tasty and light with no residual kernel shells that get stuck in your teeth...4 stars.<br /><br />Problem with using it in hot air poppers is that the kernels are too light and fly out of the machine before they pop.  Tilting the machine helps keep them inside, but it would be simpler just to find another larger kernel corn.

review/text: We've enjoyed this popcorn every bit as much if not more than the Movie Theater Popcorn.  It's light and fluffy - tender - and delicious.  I think we enjoy it a bit more because we know there is no "palm" oil or coconut oil in it - we can control what oils we add or leave out.  It works well with the popper - in fact just last night we had a popper full of this corn and followed it with the other because we had purchased so much of the other - we enjoyed this more.

review/summary: Great little mini popcorn!
review/text: I bought the Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper several months ago, which (of course) the Wabash Valley popcorn came recommended (same company). I thought...what the heck; I've always wondered how "gourmet" popcorn differed from Orville or other everyday popcorn brands.<br /><br />Let me tell you...IT IS WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY! I can really taste the difference in quality. AND, "normal" popcorn just doesn't taste right when you make it in the Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />This popcorn is so tender and tasty. It was a little weird to see and eat at first because it's about half the size of regular popcorn. But, I believe this characteristic is essential in helping the seasonings completely coat the corn.<br /><br />My favorite prep methods include using the Whirley-Pop and Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (see my review for that for more details!) I add a little peanut oil, sea salt, black pepper, and a good amount of Vegaline Garlic Mist Cooking & Seasoning Spray. YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I've tried the other Amish Country popcorn, and they're all good. This is my favorite, though!

review/summary: Okay but there's much better
review/text: This is my first time trying Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country Baby White.<br /><br />Pros: It's okay with a nice mild nutty flavor. The hulls are more pronounced than with some other Amish "Baby White."<br /><br />Cons: It tends not to briskly pop up. In fact, we've burned several pans because popping it is tricky. We found that the microwave often works better than pan popping. And as mentioned above, the hulls are much more noticeable than with other Amish "Baby White" brands.<br /><br />We purchased these 6 bags and we'll use them up but won't be ordering any more. Next time we'll drive the long distance to our nearest Amish store.

Not only are the hulls just as tough as regular popcorn, the corn pops up so tiny that it's about 1/3 hull, 2/3 popped corn per kernel! I was hoping to use this as a healthy snack for my kids who love popcorn but not the hulls.<br />I popped this using every tip I could find on the internet; all experiments still resulted in a tough hull.

review/text: This popcorn is much smaller than your average popcorn, and it is virtually hulless.  That is exactly what I was looking for in a popcorn because my 3 year old LOVES popcorn.  With 3 year old children, you have to be concerned with the hulls causing choking or hurting their tender gums.  My son has no trouble eating this popcorn.  It is soft and light, doesn't get stuck in your teeth nearly as much, and has a great flavor.<br /><br />This is now my popcorn of choice for our whole family.  I usually pop it in my 10 year old cheap hot air popper with no problems.  I get very few unpopped kernels. Another reviewer stated that it flies out before popping, but I have not experienced this problem (it could depend on the popper, I suppose).  I have tried microwaving it in a paper bag, but I always seem to end up burning it.  I think it takes a little more trial and error for microwaving to get the time just right, so I just stick with my hot air popper. I get great popcorn every time!

review/summary: the worst popcorn on the planet
review/text: I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.

review/summary: Excellent popcorn
review/text: I bought this with the whirly pop popcorn popper, and I made some as soon as I got them. It is the best popcorn I've had. I thought I would mind the smaller kernel size, but I didn't. There is substantially less hull than regular popcorn. The flavor is great. I suggest using peanut oil for popping popcorn. It gives popcorn a great nutty taste - really delicious. You can buy peanut oil at any oriental (Asian) store. It's better than olive oil (olive oil and popcorn is too weird for me). But peanut oil is perfect. You won't need butter flavor or anything like that again (artificial butter flavorings are full of chemicals). Now, we pop around three times a day and always crave this for a snack instead of junkfood. Try it and you'll be popping like us.

review/summary: Popcorn was alright
review/text: The Popcorn was delivered as promised in an attractive wrapper. I used the Whirley Pop popcorn maker and used 2 tablespoons of olive oil and popped it according to the instructions of the whirley popper. While the majority of the kernels popped, there was also a large amount of 'seeds' or residue that can get caught in your teeth and are somewhat distracting while you're eating. I actually got better results using Orville Redenbacher White Popcorn Kernels in the Whirley Popper (and it was actually cheaper at the local market). Overall I give Amish Country 3 out of 5 stars and mostly for the presentation of the package than for the yield results.

review/summary: Dress it up to your liking
review/text: This soup is great if you are on a bland diet or craving potatoes. I bought a few cans locally then saw I could order them on here. When making this soup it calls for a can of milk. I use 2% organic milk and I do not fill the can up all the way as I find it too watery. I fill it with about half milk. After it has simmered in the pot I like to pour it in a bowl and add some cracked pepper to the top and mix in some shredded cheddar cheese. It is nice and creamy and hits the spot! Sadly it does not keep you full for long. I again recommend this if on a bland diet or just looking for a tasty soup you can dress up to your liking. I don't eat pork but think if one was to add bacon bits it would taste like a loaded potato soup!

review/summary: Makes for a Very Fulfilling Meal
review/text: I am a family man with the normal trappings of American society; i.e. a mortgage, car payment, insurance payments, children in school, medical bills, grocery bills, well you get the picture.  I am therefore frugal by design, because I do like to save a little of what I make.  That means that I rarely buy my lunch in the company-sponsored cafeteria, or at a local (sit down or take-out) restaurant.  I bring my lunch to work every day in the guise of Campbell's Chunky Soup in an 18.6 oz can.<br /><br />Campbell's Chunky Soup comes in a number of different varieties not all of which I enjoy, but I do enjoy most, including Campbell's "Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta," the subject of this review.  The soup brand, whose tag line used to be "so thick you could eat it with a fork, but bring a spoon because you'll want to get every drop,"  is actually quite tasty, much more so than Progresso Soup, which I find (very) bland in comparison.  And Campbell's Chunky Soup is good for you; most of the varieties have vegetables and lean cuts of meat, and are low in fat and contain at least 2 grams of dietary fiber.<br /><br />"Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta" contains (2) servings with 100 calories and 2 grams of fat per serving.  Loaded with generous bite sized portions of chicken, pasta, and vegetables, the "Soup That Eats Like a Meal," is enough to satisfy me for a few hours and the average cost is only $1.59 per can at my local Target Super Store.  How is that for an inexpensive lunch?  But my local Target and Jewel does not carry all of the varieties, but enough so that I can partake in a different flavor every day of the work week; on average I eat four cans of soup a week for lunch.<br /><br />Nutritional Information<br /><br />Ingredients: chicken stock, water, cooked chicken meat, carrots, potatoes, cooked enriched pasta, corn, diced tomatoes, and green beans; contains less than 2% of the following: celery, red peppers, salt, and dehydrated onions.<br /><br />Servicing information: One serving (1 Cup) of "Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta" contains 100 Calories, 2 grams of fat (including 0.5 grams of saturated fat), 15mg of Cholesterol, 880mg of Sodium, 15 grams of carbohydrates, 2 grams of dietary fiber, 3 grams of sugar, and 8 grams of protein.<br /><br />Conclusion<br />There is always plenty of Campbell's Chucky Soup in the pantry at my house.  It is by-and-large the only kind I buy and "Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta"figure highly on my shopping list each week.  Low in calories and fat, "Chunky Grilled Chicken w/ Vegetables and Pasta" is a tasty alternative to burger and fries, and even a sandwich.  And most importantly if fills me up until my mid-afternoon snake.  Yes, a serving is a little high in sodium, but hey a guy has to live a little; no worries.

review/text: Four years ago we got a bright beautiful AKC Golden Retriever puppy who was completely normal for the breed, except she was a picky eater.  That is very unusual based on prior experiences with the breed.  We have tried everything, or so we thought, until seeing an ad for Pro Plan Shredded Blend while watching "The Westminster" dog show this past year.  Of course it was worth a try, and voila, we first tried the beef and quite happily we have a food that she will eat without enhancement with people food leftovers.  We did not strart with leftovers, that was seen as last ditch effort to get the dog to eat food that had been tried for two days already.  We also tried the chicken shredded blend and so far that does not interest her, but we are very pleased to have finally found a food that she seems to like, hooray for Pro Plan.

review/text: These shortbread cookies are AWESOME. I prefer the orange-chocolate chip, as they go well with chai earl grey, but they're all good. The question is, are they worth the price that people offer them at in the United States? It's hard to say. As somebody who couldn't stop eating these when I started...i mean, I'd have to file for bankruptcy to satisfy the craving.<br /><br />But if you're throwing a "tea party" or something, or having some infrequent get together, it could be worth the price. For everyday...even weekly eating...forget it. While it does taste great, and that's what the 5 star is for, the price is high. But it's high because these guys use the best quality ingredients, and I'm sure because it has to be imported to the States.

review/summary: Not all shortbreads are made alike...
review/text: A colleague from the UK recommended I try shortbread during a trip to Scotland "as they don't know how to make them 'right' anywhere else apparently." With some reservation (I like baking, pastries, and cookies but haven't had a shortbread cookie I've liked yet), I bought a box and brought them home. My only MAJOR regret was that I did not bring a case home.<br /><br />These are without a doubt the most delectable, soft, flakey, gentle, sweet cookies/dessert/shortbread, I have ever had. Absolutely delicious with a cup of hot tea (recommend heather or thistle tea of the same Scottish flair, also Darjeeling works well). I did try a few other brands whilst in Edinburgh (Nairns - chunky, butterfilled, hard and rather gross. Walkers.. so-so). But this, this is the best of the best!

These treats are hard and durable, allowing the dog to scrape off small portions of the cookie at a time.  It usually takes my dog a week of constant, daily chewing just to get through one cookie insert.  These cookies are the BEST!

review/summary: Depending on your dog they may last forever or for a few minutes
review/text: I have a yellow lab that destroyed the kitchen furniture when he was teething, but he is 3 years old now, and he prefers shoes. He doesn't chew on furniture anymore, but good size rawhide bones only last an hour on his paws, which is longer than these treats but not so healthy for him. He found that instead of trying to chew these hard treats out of the rubber ball, he can get them out rather easily by dropping the ball to the kitchen floor, over and over again, until they come out. Once the treats are loose (5-10 minutes later) they break easily in his powerful jaws. Note: The treats don't come out so easily when he drops the ball on the carpet, but he knows that.<br />The treats keep him entertained for half an hour, maybe longer using one treat on each side of the ball. Not perfect, but I haven't found anything better. I would have given it 5 stars if the ball had a tighter grip to hold the treats for a little longer. My dog loves the taste, and seem healthier than rawhide, but I haven't really found anything edible he doesn't like.

review/summary: My Experience  With This Treat
review/text: After reading some of these reviews, I thought I'd comment on how I use this. I have a smallish (about 22 lbs) mixed breed dog who is a strong chewer. I started using a medium sized treat ball and everlasting treats when he was about 10 months old, right after I rescued him. I use this only with the treat ball -- I would never give him a whole treat and let him eat it in one session.  I put some kibble or some small treats in the ball, with the everlasting treat only on one side.  The kibble comes out fairly easily, but slowly enough so he still has to work for it and so he still has fun. The treats are a little larger and don't come out so easily. He's learned that chewing on the treat, pressing down on the ball, enable the treats to dispense. Once the kibble or treats are gone, he chews and licks the everlasting treat. Eventually, after several weeks, he manages to consume enough so there is a hold in the center of the treat, and at that point I usually take the everlasting treat out, break it in half, and let him have it, one half at a time.<br /><br />It used to be that he would chew and lick the treat until he got bored, but he has now learned how to get the treat out. I've never actually seen him do this, so I don't know exactly how he does it, but I now take it away from him after I've decided he's had enough.<br /><br />A couple of notes:  I think the smaller treat ball was recommended for a dog his size, but I got the medium because he's such a strong chewer.  I'm glad I did, as the smaller ball wouldn't have lasted long.  I do think this is an excellent toy/treat when used the way I use it. The treat isn't particularly nutritious, but if it's consumed over a period of weeks, it shouldn't be too harmful. Also, when it's filled with kibble, the dog is working for his food and, if you're having problems with your dog eating too fast, this will slow him or her down.

review/summary: Not "everlasting"
review/text: I picked up several bento balls and large treat balls with these treats. I have a: one year old half Timber Wolf, half German Shepherd; seven year old retired bomb detection German Shepherd, 11 month old Lab/terrier mix, and 8 month old Smooth Collie. The treats were out of the balls within minutes and demolished in under 30 minutes. I had put several smaller treats into the ball as well, so after they finished the larger treats, they managed to be entertained by trying to get the small treats out. There hasn't been much that the pack hasn't been able to figure out.<br /><br />We regularly give them fresh deer bones as treats. The wolf will strip the meat while the shepherd will eat the bones, so I didn't expect these treats to be a true challenge for their jaw pressure and mental abilities. I will continue to get them and try other various tricks out. Some include putting the disc in upside down and adding peanut butter or other purees into the balls. The treats may not last long, but the balls will allow for some creative training.

We probably wouldn't buy them again, since we were looking for something that she could work on and enjoy for a long time, and it didn't really work for that.  Either she couldn't eat it at all, or she could eat it too quickly once we cut it in half.

review/summary: Least Stinky of These Treats
review/text: First: If you don't have the ball holder, don't bother with these. They aren't really "everlasting" in the ball, but they'll last you a whole lot longer (for most dogs) when inserted in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>.<br /><br />Second: Make sure you get the right size for your dog. If you have a giant breed, this whole line isn't really for you. My 40lbs Aussie who is a moderate chewer, is about the large ball's limit and once she pops the treat out, the remainder is gone in less than 5 minutes. If you have a tiny dog, get the right size. They aren't going to be able to handle the large. They need to be able to gnaw at it, which they won't be able to do on the larger balls.<br /><br />Third: These are probably the least repugnant smelling of the discs, to me, anyway. It just smells like chicken broth when the dog gets going on it. I expected the Vanilla Mint ones to be better, but have found these are the least offensive.

review/summary: The doggie equivalent of popping in a new DVD for the kids:  Silence and Peace!
review/text: I have 3 70 pound retriever mixes and they always have to have something in their mouths. Unfortunately, it is usually one of their fellow pack-mates that they wind up chewing on and the 3 of them get to scrapping like a scrum in a rugby game. Not very restful.<br /><br />However, with 3 of the large Everlasting Treat balls stuffed with these treats, I'm good for a couple of relatively peaceful evenings. Depending on the dog and the ball, the treats usually stay in there and will one two-pack will last a couple of nights. Occasionally, the treat will "pop out" of the ball and the lucky dog will be able to chew it up in about the same amount of time as a raw-hide chip.<br /><br />I like that these aren't raw-hide since raw-hide will sometimes cause digestive issues in my dogs (and there is nothing worse when 3 big dogs have digestive issues!).<br /><br />I'm so glad to see Amazon sell these because my local Petsmart no longer carries them -- at least not in the size that I need. Plus, Amazon saves me a trip, shipping, and tax... happiness abounds for bi-peds and quadra-peds alike!

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: This product is simply fabulous.  I purchased it for my 7 month old pit bull, who is always into something and very highly food motivated.  Prior to the everlasting treat ball her favorite toy was the Chuckle, made by Premier.  The advantage to the chuckle is that I could fill it with her food for a nutritious but fun toy.  After a few months though, she learned how to get all the food out in under 10 minutes and I needed to find something else to occupy her while I focused on other things.<br /><br />She was just a couple of pounds over 40 pounds when I purchased the treat ball.  Although the large looked too big for her, it was recommended for her size so I went with that one.  Now that I've seen her playing with it I can tell that the medium would have been too small.<br /><br />The first time she got her paws on it, she chewed on the treat for six hours straight!  I actually had to take it away from her a few times and make her drink some water because I was afraid she'd make herself sick.  The discs weren't completely gone at the end of her play-fest, they really are "everlasting."  I usually give her the treat ball with both sides covered in their treats.  Her favorite is the barbecue, but it is also the darkest and will show up on fabric.  We've tried the chicken & liver too and had positive receptions to both.<br /><br />Even after playing with this for a month I can still get a good hour to myself without having to worry about her getting in to trouble when I let her play with it.  I've also tried squeezing some cheese into the center hole for her to lick and she loves this as well!  I think peanut butter would be another excellent choice.  After about a month she has found a way to pop the treats out once in a while, but it seems to be by accident because she doesn't do it every time.  Even after she pops the treats out they still last a long time.  If she doesn't get them out herself, I pop them out when there is only a rim left and give them to her to chew on.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this toy four stars instead of five is that I wish the holes in the center were smaller to accommodate her dog food or treats.  Small/med. treats fall out too quickly.  It does seem to be sized well for their Every Flavor treats, but we haven't really tried those so I can't comment on them.<br /><br />For anyone put off by the cost, this product is TOTALLY worth its weight in gold!

review/summary: NOT everlasting at all
review/text: My 10 month old german shepherd loved it. And loved it so much that in about 5 minutes he was already chewing pieces off the thing. In exactly 45 minutes the damn thing was GONE. My dog had eaten it all. I don't think it's going to hurt him, but this is NOT an everlasting treat AT ALL, definitely not for 60 pound + dogs (my pup is a very strong 80 pound gsd - all muscles, no fat).

review/summary: Airedale Approved
review/text: Being that I have an Airedale Terrier (over 70 lbs) I have to be very picky and harsh on products. Treats don't need to just say "long lasting", "tough", "durable" or "everlasting", they need to prove it. This flavor and product last way longer than I expected. It pops out of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a> a little sooner than I would like, but, considering I did have a hard time putting two treats in there I would have to say if they made it harder to come out I may not be able to put it in.<br /><br />The very first time one treat lasted a good five minutes, on the second attempt maybe more like four minutes and that is just because he knows how hard to bite down now. Either way with the whole package I would say it is a good investment as a once in a while kind of treat for when he does something special or we just need silence to watch a show (30 minutes to 1 hour, not a 2-hour series premier).<br /><br />My dog is pretty mellow when he has his exercise, but, when it is missed this can help to get some quiet. Though every dog, no matter the breed needs to be exercised.

review/summary: My lab loves these!
review/text: My black lab mix loves these. It doesn't take very long (probably an hour or so) for him to remove the top "dome" part of the treat  and make it a flat cookie inside the blue dispenser ball. The flat part of the treat lasts another four or five days until it's just a ring inside the ball and finally the ring will take him about another week to remove and consume. He loves these things so much that I have to put refills in his ball while he is outside doing his business or I can't even get enough space in the kitchen to pop the new one in before he's trying to take it back! And even when the ball is empty he carries it around and licks around the inside of the dispenser part. I guess he's licking the smell out haha!

review/summary: Five stars for the dog, one star for me
review/text: All of my dogs went nuts when I gave this to my 55 lb., only 5 month old, German Shepherd puppy. I have a 15 lb Bichon and a 4lb Yorkie-Poo. They were willing to (literally) walk into the Big Bad Wolf's den. So, the dogs go nuts over this. I do not. It stinks. I cannot stand the smell of it. Perhaps if you have an "outside" dog this would be fine...but, no, it would attract skunks and raccoons. You have to REALLY LOVE YOUR DOG if you are willing to put up with the smell. (bully sticks are nothing compared to these) And, to add insult to injury, the toy that I purchased with these inserts does not comply with those inserts. I would've really appreciated a heads up on that. I would have been happy to buy the truly corresponding toy.

review/text: My 2 year old inteligent Red Heeler had this treat out of the puzzle ball and devoured in about 25 minutes.  However, my 12 year old "not that smart" Chow mix couldn't get the treat out of the puzzle and licked the treat for hours, until the Red Heeler got a hold of it.  So, if you have a "not so smart" dog this is a good product.  But if your dog is smart it's not worth the price.

review/text: We initially bought the treat ball and treats a couple of years ago for our puppy. We wanted a treat that would last a while and was safe. It is such a great pacifier and chew toy for puppies and dogs. Whenever we would leave the house our puppy showed signs of anxiety and this really helped distract her while we were out.  It is also a helpful tool to distract dogs while you entertain guests.  Great treat for dogs.

review/summary: Yummy to my puppy's tummy!
review/text: I bought a 2-pack of the chicken flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very "everlasting" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (Liver and Vanilla Mint). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!

review/text: Bought a pack of these (chicken flavor) and the BBQ flavored large treats when I purchased the large Everlasting Treat Ball for our 13 month old Samoyed. I installed one of each flavor on the ball and he hasn't stopped gnawing or playing with it yet!  He worked on the chicken end for over 2 hours yesterday and has yet to dislodge it from the ball, albeit he did make quite a dent in it.  Other days, he'll work on the BBQ end. So far, we're a big fan of this treat/toy combo as well as the flavor varieties available. I think I'll try the liver flavor next!

review/text: These are great treats to use with the large blue disk like things.  The disc like things are good for hiding food and then my miniature schnauzer has to work to get them out.  If I put one of these treats on top she is trying to eat this thing for hours then can't even get it all, so it lasts for a few days before I have to take the treat out so she can finish it.  But I would definitely recommend this with the large blue disk like things as a toy that keeps a dog occupied for a pretty long time.

review/summary: Everlasting Dog Treats -- Love at First Bite!
review/text: This was an instant success for our food- and treat-fussy Siberian, and our "normal" voracious Malamute.<br /><br />Pros: 1) Most importantly: If our siberian will accept (as in devour!) these treats, we predict most any other fussy pups will too.<br /><br />2) Someone intelligently designed the treat holders and shape of the treats themselves so that they can't be immediately removed and consumed... our dogs spend hours working on their treat ball. True to their breeds, our pups get in an occasional gnawing moment, but for the most part they have to lick and nibble their way through their treat. Which means when we leave for an extended time, they are honorably occupied, not bored, and not getting into mischief.<br /><br />3) The ball itself is made of a soft-ish, somewhat pliable material, and yet appears to be indestructible. Time will tell.<br /><br />4) A variety of flavors. We purchased each of the available flavors to learn which would "win", and immediately discovered that all flavors send our pups into exited expectation when they see their ball coming.<br /><br />5) You can put your own treats inside the ball itself, but it looks like a tough nut for any dog to get to.<br /><br />Con: and this could be a good thing: it's hard getting a treat into the ball unless you have strong hands/wrists, or a smooth ended spoon handle to help peel the retaining edge of the treat ball opening over the edge of the treat. This means your pup will not likely remove the treat in one lump (unless he uses that smooth spoon handle) and immediately consume it.

The Everlasting Ball is pretty cool, you insert smaller treats in the inside and then place the Everlasting Treats on the outside.  The dog has to work his way into the inside, and the treats hidden on the inside keep his mind exercised.

review/summary: Orange treat is better
review/text: Before I comment on the cookies. I want to inform buyers about the toy that you insert these into. Petsmart and other pet stores sell a blue ball. You stick a treat on both sides of that one. I purchased one and promptly had to return it...because on the car ride home my dog was able to get chunks of the blue plastic ripped off. I at that time decided to never purchase one of these again. However, I was recently at Pet Supplies Plus getting my sheltie groomed and I wanted to get a treat for my heavy chewer since she got left at home and was very unhappy. While browsing the treat insert toys(kong, etc) I noticed the orange ball of this that holds one cookie and small kibble or treats on the other side. I promptly dismissed it because of it being an everlasting toy. I continued to browse and when I realized that we either have or have tried pretty much every other treat stuffed toy. I decided to try it since if she ripped it apart they would refund my money and I would know if it was good or not.<br /><br />I got home and man oh man did I have a happy dog. She still has not even punctured the rough rubber. Unlike other reviewers stating that the treat came out easily in the blue ball this one did not. Once she had cleaned the middle out I could not get the treat out to save my life. I had to use a meat mallet to bust it apart. She does, however, get any kibble or other treats out of the backside very easily. We only put treats in the back when we need to get her interested again.<br /><br />Just to elaborate on the chewing power of my dog. She can eat a full rawhide in just an hour or so. (a large rawhide with the tied ends, she is 26 pounds). She has also demolished a couple of kong's and ate through the rope on the tug-a-jug toy. She also completely chewed trough the Twist-and-treat by the same company.<br /><br />The only other flaw I see with this product is the rubber. It is a lint/hair magnet. I hate picking it up and am constantly washing it because it picks up all the dog hair and lint possible...On the reverse side I love that it is not a toy that peanut butter or other semi solids work best in. I hate putting them in the kong because it leaves a very bad smell and clean up if not taken away promptly and cleaned.<br /><br />Onto the cookies. They are very hard and last her a couple hours of constant chewing. I have a large treat ball even though she is weighted into the medium. I find the oversized toys help prevent her getting a good grip and ripping it apart. She seems to love the flavor and loves when we put a new treat in. I do find them at a very good price compared to other refill treats.<br /><br />Over all I find it one of the best treat filled toy buys that we have made. It has out lasted any of the Kong's...even the black ones. It is easier to clean and provides her with a lot of enjoyment...and us with a lot of laughter as she tries to go at it.

review/text: Ok the bad news,  these aren't the healthiest treats but if it takes ages to eat them then it doesn't matter so much. Gluten is no big deal unless u have allergies or celiacs (do dogs get that?). They do make one with rice gluten if ur dog can't do wheat.  Garlic (like onion) causes a type of anemia in dogs if given in significant amounts, low levels like in this treat or in some foods is safe but I don't like it.<br /><br />Also they don't last long if put in the way the toys show you. My dog gets it out and finishes it in less than a minute when put in right side up.<br />Upside down ( bump facing inside the ball) it takes her up to a week to finish it. I also give it to her for only like an hour or two at a time now because after a while when she had it out all the time she got bored with it. Taking it away keeps her interested. The Bento ball also works best for me.<br /><br />Chicken is likely my dogs favorite flavor. I'm surprised she likes them because she's not very food oriented. (She also likes the natural ones but hates liver.)<br /><br /> Medium is the right size for my dog she's about aussie or border collie size 35 to 40 pound. Large is actually easier for her, maybe not for other dogs.

review/summary: A Really Tough Treat!
review/text: This very solid chicken flavored dog chew may have an unusual appearance, yet it works!  Most women who see this chew in person will experience a momentary impression that it resembles, yes, I'll say it, a diaphragm.  On a serious and positive note, the round chew is challenging for dogs to grasp when the chew is concave to the floor.  Hardwood makes an excellent shuffleboard surface and my dogs kick and chase it for fun.  The exterior is somehow resistant to dog saliva, so messy floor streaks and drool spots were surprisingly absent.  My two dogs kick it, chase it and trot about the house with these very durable chews for days.  Eventually, something possesses the dogs and they start working at dismantling the 'bone'.  It literally takes hours of dedicated canine chomping and gnawing for the chew to be reduced to crumbs.  The final word is that there are no intestinal after effects in what I have observed in my two English Springers. These "Everlasting Treats" make it possible for me to sit down and watch a film in solitude. - an activity long ago lost by any 'Springer parent'.

review/summary: Great for aggressive chewers
review/text: We have a 88lb silver lab.  He loves to chew things.  We have a hard time finding toys that he don't have chewed up in 10 minutes.  These are great if you put them in the blue rubber ball.  The first time he played with it he took him about 2 days.  But he has slowed down on it now but he chews on it everyday.  It's one of his toys that he hides so no one knows where it is except for him.

review/summary: Best Small Dog Chew Toy-Treat
review/text: I found the Everlasting Bento Ball and Everlasting dog treats one of the best long lasting toys I have found for my 10 lb. Bichon mix. She just loves to play, toss around and chew on the Bento Ball. It takes here weeks to chew down the middle of the treat inside.  It takes her minutes to chew down any other chewing treats like the bully sticks.  I'm not buying those any longer.  I can imagine that larger dogs would find a way to chew into one of the treats inside any of the Everlasting Treat toys very quickly.  But, for smaller dogs, this type of chew toy is ideal.

review/summary: Great Treat!
review/text: My 8 month old Husky Mix LOVES these treats.  The first time she had one she figured out how to get the treat out of the ball within a few minutes.  However if you put the treat in upside down she had to work on it for hours!

review/summary: Longest lasting dog treat I've found
review/text: This is by far one of the best dog treats I've found for my pitbull mix. She will devour a large rawhide in 30 minutes of less. These treats last for hours or days. They work best when both treat discs are placed in the ball. It takes a lot more mental work for my dog to stabilize the ball and chew on the treat. (Plus I thinks its adorable to see her use her paws like hands:) I tried to make my supply of discs last longer by only putting in one at time, which backfired because it allowed her to chew through the one disc much faster. In a true testament to this product's quality, it still took her about 4-5 hours to eat just the one. Now I use both discs and just take it away from her after a couple of hours. She loves these treats.
