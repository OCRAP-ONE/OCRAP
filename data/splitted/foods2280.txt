review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: I love this stuff. I had always been a major eater of salt. I put salt, and lots of it on most everything. About a year ago I was put on a low sodium diet. This was a real shock. I could barely eat most things and didn't enjoy anything. I lost 40 lbs in the first two months. The Roland glaze's are one of the items that made eating tolerable and even enjoyable. I have all the flavors and like them all. If I were forced to pick a favorite it would probably be ginger. By the way the other products that have helped with my diet are Chef Jimmy's My Mojo(a huge flavor boost for a modest amount of sodium,) Kernel Seasons Barbecue Popcorn Seasoning and Kayoda Sesame Oil. I have even gained back about 15 pounds.

review/text: Even though this is a black tea, it is a good winding down your day tea.  The chamomile and lavender are relaxing when you think this tea, being black, would perk you up.  But that is this tea's magic.  I wouldn't think chamomile and lavender would work blended in a tea, but they do, and you can also see the flowers in big piece in the tea.

review/text: These are the same cookies you can get at some costcos across the country, but not at mine, so I was very happy to find an alternative source.<br />However, true to so many of amazons items, the picture does not match the product.  I looked at the picture and saw that it was the same 3 batch box that I usually get, however the description is for a two batches only, so its really NOT a good deal at all.  It's waay more expensive than what is sold at Costco.<br />I knew amazon had a hard time getting pictures to match the actual product sold, so I'm not surprised, just disappointed that I wasn't more careful.

review/summary: I stopped feeding Evangers to my GSD (he did have digestive problems)
review/text: I too stopped feeding Evanger's to my German Shepherd. I do not trust their products because the owners have done some very dishonest things. The company can say whatever they want but I personally feel that if a person is dishonest in one area of their life, then most likely they will be dishonest in all areas.<br /><br />My GSD did eat the lamb and rice and the beef flavor. I want to point out here that my GSD did have frequent diarrhea and nausea when I fed him this can food mixed with a high quality holistic dry food containing oats, barley and rice.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I have changed ALL his food and put him on a grain free diet. I did it for his itchy skin but soon realized that his diarrhea and vomiting/nausea went away completely.<br /><br />I feed him Taste of the Wild dry dog food (salmon formula and lamb formula) mixed with canned EVO 95%. He loves the EVO 95% Beef the best but he just happens to prefer beef. I have used Evo 95% Beef, Duck, Salmon and Chicken/Turkey combination (NOT THE TURKEY/CHICKEN COMBINATION BECAUSE THERE IS A DIFFERENCE). No more digestive issues. This is the regimen I am sticking with.

It's a nice alternative flavor for our dog and he experienced no digestive problems with the change, one of the benefits of Firstmate dog foods -- all flavors are interchangeable.

review/summary: not what you think
review/text: The label says "organic" but it isn't fresh.  It is from concentrate and has "flavoring" added to it.<br />The taste is not good, in my opinion.  The flavor packs are added to concentrates because the concentrates are usually stored in drums for years and are devoid of flavor.  This may explain why the taste is "off".  Also, you wonder how do they concentrate the liquid and how much degradation occurs?  Do they dilute it with tap water?<br />If authentic taste is a priority, there are other brands that are better.

So, we would want to know the process for concentration, in what kind of storage container is was shipped in, at what tempurature, for how many days and what kind of water was used to reconstitute it. I don't think the advertising makes any of this clear.

Why on earth would coconut water that is fresh need flavoring added? (and just because it is called natural flavors, does not mean it is natural - it is still made in a lab, it just means it must have originally been derived from something natural before it is processed).<br /><br />Skip this and go with something that is actually fresh coconut water.

review/text: Don't be fooled by the slick graphic of a young green coconut with coconut water splashing out of it.  Also, don't let the "USDA Organic" stamp sway your purchase.  Not only is this coconut water from "concentrate", it also has "natural flavors" which is liberally used by companies who don't want you to know their products contain MSG.  For further information about this go to the excellent website Truth in Labeling where I had a re-education on reading labels.  MSG is a neurotoxin and it is something you don't want to be ingesting.

The fact that there are so many sports drinks out there it gets a bit overwhelming as to what we are actually consuming in our body.  After reading what it has to offer you could not help but try it, then love it.  I am also a caregiver for my 92 year old mother.  I have a trying time sometimes having her consume enough fluids so I offered her with a 11 ounce bottle of coco libre "she loved it" and drank two in one day.  Thank you for this wonderful healthy product and<br />giving my mom water with benefits.

review/summary: It reseals; that is the best thing I can say
review/text: I have been drinking coconut water for several years and have tried almost every brand. I finally found the best one - by a long shot: Taste Nirvana brand. Still, when I saw CoCo Libre Organic coconut water on sale at a local store, I immediately purchased one to compare it. If I hadn't been so thirsty, I would have tossed it after the first swallow. It's the latest in a series of "natural" coconut waters that are anything but. It tastes cooked, tastes like it has additives in it (it's from concentrate) and it tastes flat and slightly plasticky. It's really unappealing to me. The fact that  you can reseal the bottle is nice, but no reason to subject yourself to an inferior product. Taste Nirvana is incrediblly light and fresh; it seems like my cells just absorb it instantly. There is no aftertaste and the product is fantastic from batch to batch. I like the size in the cans, but Taste Nirvana also comes in resealable bottles that are the same size as Coco Libre. Do yourself a favor and buy Taste Nirvana instead. No, I am not affiliated in any way with the company, but I do really respect and support products that are clean, as close to truly natural as possible, and delicious. Coco Libre is not.

It was by far the smoothest and freshest coconut water i have ever tasted.

As an avid runner i have tried almost every coconut water out there post workout to aid in my recovery, and with this one i actually felt a serious difference. Unfortunately it doesnt appear that it is available on the east coast yet, so I will definitely purchase this when it becomes available on amazon.<br /><br />Thank you for finally coming out with a 100% organic coconut water!!!

review/text: The first time I tried coconut water was in Brazil. I drank the water straight from an actual coconut with a straw. That was pretty much the ultimate, but Coco Libre is the next best thing. It is the only organic coconut water that I have found and it tastes delish. I love coconut water because of the potassium and the fact that it is a naturally low calorie, extremely thirst quenching alternative to neon colored, artificially flavored Gatorade and Vitamin Water. Perfect during bikram yoga, or hiking, or the gym.<br /><br />Also, I love the fact that it is in a resealable bottle as opposed to the tetra pack with a peel off top. It fits in my car holder without spilling.<br /><br />Highly recommend!

review/summary: Smells like plastic
review/text: If I could give this zero stars, I would. I don't often leave many reviews, but this was pretty awful so I had to say something so others could avoid this awful "organic" coconut water. On first opening it, all I could smell was plastic and metal. I'm assuming both smells come from the bottle it's in. The taste was not any better. It tasted like plastic water flavored with coconut. Never again. If you can find harmless harvest or taste of nirvana, try those.

review/text: Well this is my first time trying coconut water and I love it! I bought it as a replacement for sweet tea and sodas and I am pleased. To me even though this is water it has a "creamy" texture as you drink it. The bottles are nice sized but this water is kinda expensive but being healthy cost. But I will definitely buy this productt again!

review/text: I like the smaller size of these packages so that I can take it with me when I go somewhere (nice that it's a twist top bottle). I don't care for the taste of this as much when it's not cold though. If you like the taste of unflavored coconut water you will probably like this - generally I prefer something with a little bit of other fruit flavor in with it, but this has a nice flavor to it. Good for after working out or being outdoors though to replenish electrolytes and potassium.

review/summary: Salty!
review/text: This coconut water is so salty, and actually has 120 mg of sodium per bottle (5% of your Daily Value)! I like that it is organic, it comes in a great bottle size, and that it really has a lot of great nutrients. In my opinion, although the flavor behind the saltiness is great, this is really not drinkable due to the sodium content.I guess coconut water just has a lot of sodium, but I've never had one that actually tasted this salty. However, I have had great success using this in baked goods and mixed drinks (alcoholic and non) it really masks the saltiness and I get all the benefits of an organic coconut water! I received samples of this product to review; I was not compensated for my review in any way.

review/summary: Expired Chips?!?
review/text: I just received the Miss Vickie's Variety Pack of 30 today and on the bag it says to sell by Sep 25th. Now I though that the sell by date was Sep 25th 2013 not Sep 25th 2012. I tried a bag just to see and the chips tasted like their really close to their expiration date. They tasted like their about to go stale. I tried a different flavor just to double check and though it tasted alittle better it was also tasted like it was close to its expiration date. I gave it to some friends to try because taste is a personal preference. They told me that it didn't taste as fresh and was alittle stale. A friend referred me to this brand of chips. So I decided to try it out. Since I can't purchase this in stores where I live. I decided to just order it in bulk online. This way I can pack a bag of chips for lunch everyday for a month. Now I regret it. Now I only have 8 days to finish 30 bags of chips. How am I suppose to do that? Unless I want to become morbidly obese<br /><br />I essentially just paid $25 for a box of chips with a shelf life of 8 days. This is unacceptable. Stay away from this vendor and purchase it from a store if you can.

review/summary: Sugar Plum Spice Tea is The "Bomb"
review/text: I discovered this flavored tea during the Thanksgiving holidays, 2009 at my daughter's house. I am NOT a tea OR coffee drinker but she pressured me to try "this amazing flavored tea" and the rest, shall we say is history! Now I just can't start my day without it. There is no caffeine, however, and all natural ingredients but the flavor is perfect and it stands alone! I would recommend this to anyone, even those "non tea or coffee drinkers". It was introduced as a "Holiday Tea" so it is not supposed to be available throughout the year and it is now almost impossible to find EXCEPT through Amazon. Thanks Amazon and your sellers for making it available for me, all year long!

review/summary: Fun, Intense Holiday Tea
review/text: ****<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings' Sugar Plum Spice is a delightful holiday tea. It contains hibiscus, roasted barley malt, roasted chicory root, rosehips, chamomile flowers, natural plum flavor with other natural flavors, ginger root, roasted carob, and cardamom. It does not contain caffeine, so it's technically an herbal tea.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings has been around a long time, and makes quality teas. All of their teas are free of preservatives and artificial colorings and flavorings, all are certified Kosher and none use irradiated botanicals, which I appreciate. Although they use "natural flavors" in their teas, these natural flavors are derived primarily from fruits, spices and herbs, and never contain monosodium glutamate (MSG). They use environmentally conscious packaging and sustainable sourcing. To remove the caffeine from green and black teas, they use a process called "effervescent decaffeination" (using carbon dioxide). Celestial Seasonings justifiably takes pride in being a company that makes natural teas.<br /><br />On the package, Celestial Seasonings writes, "Take a sip of Sugar Plum Spice and journey with us to the Land of the Sweets in Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker. Here you'll find gingerbread houses, trees laden with sugar plums and days filled with sunshine. This is the land of the Sugar Plum Fairy, who is beautiful, gentle and kind. We created this tea to pay tribute to her. Sugar Plum Spice is made with 100% natural herbs and the festive flavors of plum and spice, with just a hint of sweetness." This tea is slightly sweet and full bodied, tasting just as you would expect from the description. The cardamom and ginger give it a little zing. Each tea bag packs a lot of flavor and I only need to use one at a time.<br /><br />I recommend it, even if it's not a holiday. It's perfect for a cold or wet winter day.<br /><br />****

While watching the enchanting dances, one can savor this spicy sweet tea. The plums aren't dominating, but it definitely has a spicy cardamom kick!  Despite its zippiness, it isn't caffeinated. It tastes exotic and antiquated enough to flow from someone's silver samovar. This tea will have visions of sugar plums dancing in your head!

review/summary: Aromatic holiday tea
review/text: Celestial Seasonings is well known for their all-natural, quality teas.  This specific tea is highly aromatic, with slight notes of plum and cinnamon, strongly reminiscent of a cherry lifesaver.  For this reason, we find the flavor barely palatable.  There was a lingering aftertaste that we did not prefer.  If you like a tart tea, this may just be the tea for you.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings guarantees their tea.  They want to ensure complete satisfaction, or they will refund your money.  A refund was not attempted for this tea since it was merely a personal preference; the tea is still high quality, and will be enjoyed by many.  For more information, visit CelestialSeasonings.com, which lists each their vast array of flavors.

review/text: Xyloburst Peppermint Gum, 100 count<br />Made in USA with materials from China (Non GMO)<br /><br />Ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Base, Natural Flavors (peppermint oil), Vegetable Glycerin, Gum Arabic, Soy Lecithin, Beeswax<br /><br />This was my first time trying xylitol gum and it was pretty good.  Very intense at first and then fades, but not too quickly.  The flavor does last awhile considering it's a more natural gum.  I was debating between this and Spry gum, but a lot of reviewers said that Spry faded quickly.  Glad I chose this instead.  The pieces look big in the container (each is 1.5grams), but they chew down small so you might want to chew 2 at a time.  Amazon also has a 500 count container, which is a better value if you can afford paying it at once.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015NE02K">Xyloburst Peppermint Xylitol Chewing Gum 500 Count</a>  This also comes in blister packs (total of 144 pieces) and sometimes it's cheaper than the 100 count container <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019AC50I">Xyloburst Peppermint Blister Pack 12 12 Pc Packages</a>.  I used to chew Orbit Peppermint gum, but I think I'll get this from now on.  Less chemicals and tastes better.  And if you're looking for xylitol breath mints, try Ricochet <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FIWIWA">Emerald Forest Ricochet Sugar Free Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint, 100-Count Tins (Pack of 6)</a>.

review/text: According to the manufacture the xylitol used in this gum is produced in the USA from birch, not GMO corn from China. This gum has a pleasant taste it is not too strong or over powering. Xyloburst, like most xylitol gum does not have long lasting flavor, but it does last long enough and it does not get rock hard once the flavor is gone so you can chew it for a while. The gum does a great job of controlling  bad breath/ refreshing your breath after meals. The added oral hygiene benefits you get from the xylitol is also a plus. I have been chewing this gum for a while and I have nothing bad to report,

review/summary: Can't cook Japanese without it
review/text: The basic stock for 1,000s of Japanese recipes, dashi is absolutely essential for anyone wanting to cook authentic Japanese cuisine.  As famous chef Shizuo Tsuji once said " "many substitutes for dashi are possible, but without dashi, dishes are merely a la japonaise and lack the authentic flavor".<br /><br />Dashi can be made pretty easily from scratch, boiling some kombu or katsuobushi shavings, but you often make far more than you need for the particular recipe, and it can be a pain to spend all that time boiling.  Instant dashi does the trick just fine, and almost no one will notice the substitution.  This kind here, "Hon Dashi" (meaing "Real Dashi"), is the cream of the crop of instant substitutes.  Made by the company Ajinomoto, Hon Dashi is absolutely brimming with umami, the fifth basic flavor found in Asian cooking.  Hon Dashi is made from katsuobushi shavings, so it is a basic fish stock and not suitable for vegans, who would probably want to make their own kombu stock.<br /><br />I use Hon Dashi for almost everything, from basic miso soup, to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJSP9C">tamagoyaki</a>, to using it to boil vegetables and give them a heartier flavor.  Along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB210">mirin</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002YB3ZK">soy sauce</a>, it is one of the most basic ingredients in a Japanese kitchen.

I tried making my miso with and without wakame; I even tried mixing the pastes and still could not get it right.<br /><br />I FINALLY got it! I didn't even intend to order Hon Dashi, had it on my wish list, but it was the best mistake I could make.<br /><br />I'll be experimenting with my dashi to see what else I can add it to.

review/summary: Ajinomoto Hon Dashi
review/text: I buy this locally in a much larger box but it is the same product.  This product is just as good as making your own, which I did for years before finding it.  The larger box has 1,000 servings but that is for a weak dashi so I use double the granules.  For this product with the 3 packets, just add them into a small jar and use 1 ts per cup hot water (adjust to your tastes).  That adjustment is why it says '3 to 6 cups'.  Also, this product stores with no loss in flavor in a sealed container for years.  I actually have some in a salt shaker (with rice to keep it dry) and use it commonly as a flavor boost to vegetables (green ones especially work well with it).<br /><br />This is actually a good starter size box.  For those not sure what to do with it, a sample recipe:<br /><br />3 cups made up dashi (1 packet)- taste and add water if you wish it weaker.<br />1 packet Udon noodles (may use cooked spagetti) appx 1.25 cups volume<br />1 cup lightly packed leafy vegetables (spinach, mustard greens, cabbages etc)<br />Optional- baby bok choys whole, shellfish (whole or chopped), peeled shrimp, miso<br /><br />Bring to a simmer and as soon as the veggies and optional meats are done to your liking, it's ready.  This is the 'kitchen sink' soup of Japan, meaning just about anything might land in there though the items are normally pre-cooked leftover bits.

review/summary: Very Good Dashi - Makes Great Homemade Miso Soup!
review/text: I am very happy with this dashi.  I like that I can use it to make just a small amount of stock if a recipe calls for it, and it also makes an excellent miso soup without having to get take-out every time I happen to crave some. (For two servings I use 1 tsp dashi powder, 3 cups water, 2 big tbsp miso paste - plus add-ins like onion, tofu, etc. It's really good!) This is a good value too - a box this size will last me a long time.  Inside the box there are 3 foil packets to help it stay fresh.  They do recommend refridgeration of the opened portion, but the rest can stay on a shelf.<br /><br />Although salt is listed first on the ingredient list, the sodium level in this product is not very high.  Which is good considering the amount of sodium that other Japanese ingredients tend to have in them. It's important to remember that ingredients are listed by weight: salt is going to weigh much more than the dried fish flakes.

review/text: Most chefs would probably prefer to make their own soup stock. However,if you're in a pinch an instant soup stock can be a life saver. If you want to make some tasty dashi fast than Ajinomoto's excellent HonDashi can be your savior. The flavor is there and HonDashi is so easy to use.<br /><br />Each box contains 3 bags. Nutrition facts and a serving suggestion are listed on the back of the box. 150g of HonDashi should take you a long way.

review/summary: Should have read the bad review first.
review/text: Just back from a trip to Japan, hungry for some good nabeyaki udon, I ordered this stock. There's got to be something better on the market. I love salt, and dashi should be salty, but not overwhelmingly so. And why sugar, let alone two or three types of sugar? While I don't have a problem with MSG myself, I do try to avoid it. Probably my own fault; I should have specified "No MSG", except it never occurred to me that a package with this many bad chemicals wouldn't be labelled somewhere!<br />Outside of any of this, the dashi has none of the complexity or subtlety you hope for in a dashi base. I know if I want all of that, I need to make it from scratch, but since purchasing this I've tried several non-MSG brands and all of them are better. Sad to say, because Ajinomoto is a venerable company, but stick with Maruhachi or one of the other, healthier brands!

review/summary: Loaded with MSG
review/text: I haven't even tried this stuff yet, but with the first ingredient being salt, the second being MSG, then finally the third being dried bonito powder, then the next sugar, then dextrose(more sugar)...then some chemicals(disodium inosinate, disodium succinate), which sound like more salt or preservatives, or both...WTF? None of the other reviews even mention this marvelous combination of lousy ingredients...kinda stupid. If I'd wanted 3 packets of sugar, salt, and flavor enhancers....I'd have ordered salty/sugared MSG soup base.<br /><br />UPDATE: I did some research and I thought this was interesting, and since this product, and the topic of MSG seems to be so bantered about, maybe this will be interesting to someone else.<br /><br />The food additive, monosodium glutamate, was first used in the United States in any quantity in the late 1940s. According to Dr. George Schwartz, author of In Bad Taste: The MSG Syndrome, although considerable effort had been spent to introduce MSG to the USA, little had been accomplished prior to World War II. However, sometime during the war, the use of MSG in Japanese soldiers' rations was noticed. In 1948, a symposium on MSG, presided over by the Chief Quartermaster of the Armed Forces, was held in Chicago for members of the food industry.<br />By the 1960s, Accent, the leading brand of the flavor enhancer called "monosodium glutamate," had become a household word. Simultaneously, other hydrolyzed protein products such as autolyzed yeast, sodium caseinate, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein gained in popularity. Every hydrolyzed protein product, regardless of the name given to it on a label, contains MSG.<br />Although glutamic acid had been isolated in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Ritthausen, it was not until 1908 that its flavor-enhancing potential was noticed by Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo, Japan. Prior to that time, the Japanese had used seaweed as a favorite flavor enhancer, without understanding that glutamic acid was its flavor-enhancing component.<br />From 1910 until 1956, the process underlying production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" in Japan was one of extraction, a slow and costly method. Elsewhere, crude gluten or other starting materials were hydrolyzed by heating with hydrochloric acid. In 1956, the Japanese succeeded in producing glutamic acid by means of fermentation; and after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />Even before the Japanese discovered the flavor potential of processed free glutamic acid extracted from sea weed, the potential of freeing glutamic acid from protein using acid hydrolysis was being explored in Europe. At the time, however, the method was not widely used. Indeed, it was not until some time later that the flavor industry realized that various of their hydrolyzed protein products contained considerable amounts of processed free glutamic acid (MSG) -- the flavor-enhancing component of the food ingredient "monosodium glutamate" -- and production of hydrolyzed protein products for their flavor-enhancing potential escalated.<br />When "monosodium glutamate" was brought to the United States in the years following World War II it was still manufactured through extraction. By 1956, after considerable research to identify suitable strains of microorganisms for starting the requisite cultures, Ajinomoto Co., Inc. had succeeded in producing glutamic acid through a method of bacterial fermentation wherein bacteria (some, if not all of which are genetically modified)(10) are grown aerobically in a liquid nutrient medium. These bacteria have the ability to synthesize glutamic acid outside of their cell membranes and excrete it into the medium to accumulate there.(11) It was in 1956 that truly large-scale production of glutamic acid and "monosodium glutamate" through fermentation began.<br />We find it fascinating that the first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" did not appear until "monosodium glutamate" was being made by bacterial fermentation. The first published report of a reaction to "monosodium glutamate" appeared in 1968 when Robert Ho Man Kwok, M.D., who had emigrated from China, reported that although he never had the problem in China, about 20 minutes into a meal at certain Chinese restaurants, he suffered numbness, tingling, and tightness of the chest that lasted for approximately 2 hours.<br />The following year, John W. Olney, M.D. reported that laboratory animals suffered brain lesions and neuroendocrine disorders after being exposed to monosodium glutamate. Scientists studying retinal degeneration in mice treated with free glutamic acid had noted that these mice became grotesquely obese. Olney, who speculated that the obesity might be a sign of damage to the hypothalamus (the area of the brain that regulates a number of endocrine functions, including weight control), found that infant laboratory animals given free glutamic acid suffered brain damage immediately, and assorted neuroendocrine disorders later in life. Pharmaceutical grade L-glutamic acid was often used to produce these disorders until neuroscientists observed that monosodium glutamate, an inexpensive food additive, could be substituted for laboratory-grade free glutamic acid in these studies and produce the same effects.<br />In the years that followed, neuroscientists replicated the work of Olney, and Olney spoke out repeatedly about the toxic potential of monosodium glutamate. In 1972, for example, Olney testified before the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs that ingestion of MSG places humans at risk, with the greatest risk being for the very young; and that a National Academy of Science panel organized to determine whether MSG ought to be banned from baby food had produced an "industry arranged whitewash" by a group of scientists with almost no experience in neuropathology. In the early 1970s, manufacturers of baby food voluntarily removed the monosodium glutamate from their products, but replaced the monosodium glutamate with MSG-containing ingredients such as autolyzed yeast and hydrolyzed vegetable protein. In the late 1970s, manufacturers "voluntarily" removed all obvious MSG-containing ingredients from baby food.<br />Use of MSG in food has grown in the last 30 years and is still growing. MSG is found in most soups, salad dressings, processed meats, frozen entrees, ice cream, and frozen yogurt, in some crackers, bread, canned tuna, and very often in "low fat" and "no fat" foods to make up for flavor lost when fat is reduced or eliminated. It can be found in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements. It is found in enteral feeding products and in infant formula. It is found in vaccines -- including vaccines used on children. It is found in hospitals where it is hidden in the jello, chicken soup, and some IV solutions given to very sick patients.<br />Very often manufacturers use hydrolyzed protein products as MSG-containing flavor enhancers instead of using "monosodium glutamate." In the industry, an ingredient that contains MSG but is not necessarily recognized by consumers as containing MSG is called a "clean label" ingredient.

review/text: The title of this item is "Hi-chew Chews New! Assorted Fruit Flavors (10 Packs) - Strawberry, Green Apple, Grape, Mango & Melon" (copy/pasted) so it was very disappointing to get a package that had banana, peach, and other flavors.  By the way, the banana was horrible.  All other flavors are great but not what I was hoping for.  I have been a huge fan of Hi-Chew for a long time.  My favorite flavors are Strawberry, Mango, and Melon.  They are amazing.  If you have never tried it, you should go with one of those flavors.  You will not regret it.  However, this package that is advertised as having strawberry had none.  As for the mango and melon, only one of each.  It did have TWO EACH of banana and peach.  If it was advertised as assorted flavors I could understand it.  But listing strawberry in the title and then not supplying it, too disappointing to rate this any higher than one star.<br /><br />EDIT:  The seller has corrected the error by replacing the incorrect product with the correct item.  He has also let me know that they did send the wrong item by mistake.  Four stars for the correct item as the flavors are wonderful except for grape, which is still nice but not one I enjoy.  Also I don't think it actually tastes much like grapes.  The strawberry is excellent, sharp, and sweet with the consistency and tartness falling somewhere between Starburst and Gummy Bears.  Melon was wonderful, smooth, and sweet, much like biting into a delicious and ripe honeydew melon.  Mango is very nice with a similar tartness, sweetness, and consistency to the strawberry.  Green apple is nice and tart.  These candies last a lot longer than Starburst do, but have a milder flavor.  They will not last as long as Gummy Bears, but that is only if you have the patience to keep chewing and not swallow, something I am not very good at.

Only problem is, I use a 16-oz cup, so one is not quite enough and two make a bit of an overdose, so I've settled for one.  This huge box of them should last a long time at that rate.  They're just as delicious as the refrigerated coffee mate, and a little better than the powdered, which to me tastes... powdered.  I like them fine and per ounce, I got them at a better price than either the liquid or the powder.  We'll see how long they last.<br /><br />From Utopia, Texas... Enjoy your java!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I had to go away for a couple of months and when I returned, these didn't taste the same... chemical taste and not very enjoyable.  I tossed them.  I'd reduce the rating by a star or two if I could.

review/summary: Quality Creamer
review/text: This is a bulk case of the same creamer you'd purchase at the store.  Excellent, fresh tasting creamer delivered to your door and at a fraction of what other office supply companies charge.<br /><br />If you have popped containers, blame your mail carrier, not Amazon.

review/summary: Not what I thought
review/text: I'm very disappointed in these.  There's<br />WAY too much cinnamon and very little<br />vanilla taste. It took 4 of them to turn<br />my coffe a golden color, what a waste.<br />I won't buy these or any other single<br />creamers again.

review/summary: This flavor is SO Good!
review/text: I had not tried Cinnamon Vanilla (I know, buying a whole case was a little risky), but this flavor rocks!  I love the portion control and the fact that it's portable and shelf stable.

review/summary: Love this Flavor!!
review/text: I wanted to have this creamer at work, but could only find it in the big, refridgerated bottles... great for home, but not feasible when I have to leave my office and walk down the hall for my creamer for coffee...  Then I found these!  No refridgeration needed and I could port them to work!  Only drawback was the $18 for shipping.. I feel that was a little steep.

review/summary: exploded tubs
review/text: The condition in which these arived was not to my expectation.  I had at least 1/4 of the box unusable, due to exploded tubs.  The product itself is very tasty.

review/summary: Not only are they great tasting, they are real fruit juice.
review/text: I bought a box of these for the summer and loved them!! Not only did I get an enjoyable treat but they helped me lose weight.  That was a bonus!  I'm a night time snacker.  Usually turning to chips, popcorn, cookies or something high calorie like that.  When I got the Otter Pops I started eating them and found that it became a night time ritual all summer.  Because there's no fat and only 40 calories I could satisfy my snack craving with 2-3 of these and only consume 120 calories.  Over the summer I've lost 12 pounds!  But most of all, they are REALLY good!  I hope you get a chance to try them!!

review/summary: Great taste - just like having sudachi at home
review/text: If you are craving the juice of sudachi, then get this.  It is perfect taste.  Makes great tasting drinks and works wonderful in Japanese style foods.  I bought kabosu, sudachi and yuzu and I love all three products.

review/summary: Not the same "Delfa Rolls" I remember
review/text: I was very excited that 7 years later, they decide to bring "Delfa Rolls" or "Danish Ribbons" back.  Seeing these reminded me of my childhood, so I bought a case.  It took WAY too long to receive the package.  It came a day after the latest estimation date.  I busted into the box so fast.  Ripped the packaging and dug right in.  As soon at it hit my mouth I knew.  These are NOT the same as they once were.  They taste fine, but they are not the same.  I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of "Delfa Rolls" than these are.  I'm very very disappointed!

review/summary: Broadway Rolls ! Scoff!! Yuck! Yuck!
review/text: If I could give less than one star I would.  These are not the way this type of licorice is supposed to taste!! When I found these on line, I was ecstatic!  I, too, bought two boxes in my excitement.  One box for me and one for my sister and cousins, whom have all ranted on how much we miss these Delfa, Danish, Broadway licorice rolls.  I ran to my mailbox everyday for 5 days.  Why it took so long to arrive is completely beyond me since Amazon items usually take a day or two at the most!  When it finally arrived, I ripped open the box with my coat still on and car keys in hand. Patooie!  It taste like sugar and silly putty (Yes, I still remember that silly putty taste from when I was a kid.) Yucky! Just regular 'ole licorice.  I am very, very, very, very disappointed and I am returning both boxes!!!!
