review/summary: Convenient packs of power
review/text: My wife and I are avid cyclists. We routinely ride 25-40 miles per day. We also live in southern China, where in the spring and summer it is very hot. My wife is very susceptible to heat sickness and had to cut short her rides several times because she was sick. Living in China, it can be difficult to find things that in the States you would take for granted, i.e Gatorade. We purchased these last spring, and will never be without them again. They are conveniently packaged and fit well into a cycling water bottle. We keep them in our bike bags, we have never had a leak from the package and they tear extremely easily. Now when my wife is feeling overly hot, she mixes one of these in her water bottle, drinks it down, and is ready to go. We have been using them in the same bottles for several months and do not have a smell in the bottles yet, though we clean them religiously when we return home. An excellent product.

review/summary: Picky Little Kitties Like This
review/text: I have been getting this variety of Fancy Feast Medleys on Subscribe and Save for more than two years. I have 2 cats who have been eating this product for two years. Pretty good for Picky Little Kitties, and I think they all are, unless they are truly literally starving, like my Ferals sometimes are when they first wander in.<br />I do feed this on rotation, so that they do not have it every day...maybe once every 10 days. But they still eat it and they still dig in right away and do not do the "Sniff, nose up in the air 'I will eat it later' routine." They just sit down and eat.<br />My ferals get it if there are any left overs (otherwise they get dry food and the less expensive Friskies) and, of course, they announce it is just fine.<br />I figure that if the two Picky Little Kitties are still eating happily after two years, that it must be a winner.<br />Both have just recently been to the vet and were given a clean bill of health. Neither is overweight and no one is sickly; therefore, My kitties and I recommend it.

review/text: My father's cat, who is named after James Bond, usually dines on regular Fancy Feast. He has a discriminating palate and would probably send his bowl back to the kitchen on occasion if he could talk.<br />Since he likes the chicken flavors a lot, I tried Chicken Florentine with Garden Greens as a special treat.  I wafted the bowl of Chicken Florentine under James' nose while he was napping: he quickly awakened and then proceeded to devour it with gusto. He gives it two paws up.

review/text: This is the only source I have found for powdered (confectioners) maple sugar, as opposed to granulated sugar.  The powdered form is needed for my recipes for cakes and frosting.  Maple sugar is one of the available tree sugars (xylitol is another).  It is metabolized differently.  It does have a higher expense than cane or beet sugar, corn sugar, or fruit based sugars.  You would need to check with your primary care physician about use if you have problems with other forms of sugar.

It's not a big deal but kind of important.<br />I am getting their whole rye, too. This bread has more fiber and fewer net carbs comparing to whole rye but also more calories - flaxseed is almost 45% fat. So, if you need more fiber and don't mind a little fat then this particular bread is great. Taste is pretty good, too. And the price is right. Thank you, Amazon!

It could have been blamed on the UPS, however a large part of the flap on top was completely torn off and not in the box so they knew it was broken before they sent it.

review/summary: My Picky Cat LOVES this food!
review/text: I was advised to try this food by a worker at Petco when I was having difficulty finding wet cat food that my cat would like. His wet food 3oz per day would sit in his dish for hours with him only touching a little bit of it. It was a total waste of money for me.<br /><br />At first I was questioning the quality of the food because it was set in between the cheaper low supermarket brand cat foods instead of it being placed near the higher quality foods like Wellness, Natural Balanace, Blue Buffalo etc. The worker said.... "just try one 3oz can and see if your cat likes it." I looked at the ingredients and it looked like a pretty good food list. I asked her if it was made by Petco and she said "no."  I asked her if she knew who made it and she was not sure.  I am glad the other reviewer posted that it is made by the same company who manufactures<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70V0">Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> which has excellent reviews on Amazon. Finding this out makes me feel so much better about giving this food to my cat.  I give my cat a dry combo of Nature's Variety Rabbit Food with Blue Buffalo adult so I know he is getting great dry food in his system so I wasn't too worried about the wet not being up to the level of the dry as long as the food wasn't full of crappy stuff.<br /><br />Well I gave him him the Shrimp flavored one first the other day and he literally ate it in 3 or 4 minutes without stopping to take a break. I then went back to Petco to buy some more Shrimp and figured I should just try all of the flavors. Well, there wasn't much to choose from but I did buy as many flavors as was available. Apparently cat owners are getting told about this wonderful food and the stores are running low on it. I picked up the Chicken & Pumpkin(gone in 3 minutes again yesterday) as well as the Tuna in Gravy ( ate it this morning in less than no time) so I am really glad the Petco worker suggested this food to me. I am certain that my male Ragdoll will love the rest of the flavors too given how much he has loved 3 of them so far.<br /><br />The foods come either in a gelee or a gravy. My cat loves both forms of the wet cat food. The three cans I have opened so far two of them, the chicken and the tuna were both in a shaved meat form while the shrimp and crab was not in a shaved form but I could see the pieces of crab in the food.  I couldn't not believe that I saw actually crab meat in this food!  I hate to tell more cat owners about this food in fear that the shelves will be completely empty when I need cat food but I just couldn't help spreading the good news about this new food I found.<br /><br />I would not hesitate trying this food. It seems to be a winner in my house!!

review/summary: Good cat food for a decent price
review/text: Soulistic cat foods are made by the same company that makes Weruva and BFF, but it is made specifically for Petco.  My son recommended these brands as a better grade of food with a little better price than some of the higher end foods (he was a local pet store manager and learned about all kinds of pet foods). So far we have only tried the "gelee" flavors, not the "gravy" ones.  They are all tuna or chicken based, with other fish products mixed in among the ingredients.  They are grain-free, no soy, gluten or nasty additives.  So far I have not had any complaints from the crew here (6 ranging from 4 months to 11 years).  Next order we may try the "gravy' flavors.  Shipping was less expensive if ordered through Amazon than through Petco, shipping was quick, package arrived before the expected delivery date.

I like it open faced with a little honey instead of the jelly. Supposedly people make other sandwiches with it. I like the flavor and how thin each slice is. It would probably be good with cheese, but I am lactose intolerant. This variety has no soy either which is good for me. I am glad Amazon can ship them to me as none of my small town grocers carry it.

It helps to give it plenty of steeping time and make sure the water is hot enough.

This time around, Laziz had the lowest price at $1.692 per pound, using Amazon Prime free shipping. I buy 20 to 25 lbs at a time, which really cuts the price down.<br /><br />As for basmati rice in general, it's a great rice -- holds its shape, and has a wonderful delicate nutty flavor and aroma. Once you've had basmati rice, you'll never buy the crap they sell in the grocery store again. It improves everything you eat rice with.

review/summary: the perfect rice for stir-fries
review/text: OK, I'm a fried rice fanatic and in my opinion, this is the best rice to use.  At first, I cooked it in the standard 2:1 ratio of water to rice; it was too sticky.  So I decided to follow the directions on the package (duh) and used only 1.5 cups liquid to 1 cup of rice.  Perfectly cooked in about 15 minutes, each grain separate and ready for stir-fry.  With conventional rice, I had to chill it before it could be fried; this rice doesn't require that step.  I will definitely purchase this again !

review/text: These cookies are delicious. No one would EVER know they're gluten-free. I'm used to giving up taste, texture or both when I buy or make gluten-free foods, but these are as good as any packaged chocolate chip cookie. In fact, they're better than most I've tried. They're not dry and hard like a lot of packaged cookies. I highly recommend them.

review/summary: These cookies make going gluten free a bit easier.
review/text: I am at the beginning of my gluten free journey and have largely been dismayed by the taste of most gluten free foods purchased to date. But these cookies are AWESOME!  I love the strong gingery flavor and while they feel quite hard to the touch, once you put them  in your mouth and chew, they break apart very easily and practically melt in your mouth. I wanted to eat the whole bag during the first sitting and enjoyed them so much that I nibbled on them throughout the day until the bag was empty.  YUMMY!<br /><br />I didn't order these through Amazon, I purchased them at my local supermarket.  I always worry about the age of mail-ordered food and the conditions in which they were stored.  Plus, I can see that given the hardness of these cookies, if shipped they probably would be mostly crumbs upon arrival.

review/summary: These don't really resemble chocolate chip cookies
review/text: I know allowances need to be made for being gluten free, since it's hard to get good texture and taste from gluten-free, but these chocolate chip cookies don't compare at all well with their namesakes.  There's a weird flavor that overwhelms everything else--not sure if it's the rice syrup or what, but whatever it is, that plus the texture which is pretty gritty and chalky at the end makes these cookies a one-time purchase.  They're so bad I'm throwing them out instead of eating them.  The gingersnaps are tolerable.  Not great, but definitely more edible than the chocolate chips.

review/summary: Pamela's Products Ginger Mini Snapz
review/text: I use Pamela's pancake mix and my family loves it, so I was eager to try her ready-made cookies as well. Have to be honest and say that I don't really care much for the Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz. They are so HARD! Way beyond "crispy". I think part of the problem is they're just too thick. A thinner, wider cookie would have been better. On the plus side, though, they are very gingery.<br /><br />I'm going to try to soften them up a bit. And perhaps they'll be good as a pie or cheesecake crust, but just for snacking, no, I wouldn't recommend them. Now to think of what to do with the other 5 bags. :/

review/text: This is coming from a chocolate lover.  I ordered the "extreme chocolate" cookies thinking I was up for a challenge.  Well, they are good but not great.  I can't believe I'm saying this but the chocolate is actually overwhelming.  I'm saving the rest of the bags to make a chocolate crust for my cheesecake but I won't order this type again.  I do agree that it almost tastes like the top part of an oreo but with more intense taste.  My husband hated them and my 3 year old wasn't fond of it.  On the other hand, I have been ordering the chocolate chip flavored ones.  They are awesome!  It has a perfect balance and a hint of vanilla.  My family loves it and even my co-workers too!

review/summary: Tasty for a "cookie-free" cookie
review/text: I've been struggling with food intolerance lately, and by far the worst offender is sugar. Be that as it may, for some reason I don't have a problem with these cookies although they do contain sugar in the form of evaporated cane. They taste wonderful with just the right amount of spice and taste great dipped in coffee or milk if you can have that. I'd never know I was eating wheat-free gluten-free, or as my husband calls it, a "cookie-free cookie," had I not read the package first. I like ginger snaps to begin with, and these taste great. They are a bit larger than a quarter, are crisp rather than soft, and have 130 calories per 4-cookie serving. No trans fats; 10g sugar.

review/text: I have recently been put on a gluten free diet and have been nosing around at my local health food store for cookies that I could eat which did not contain wheat/gluten nor nuts/seeds.  I happened upon this bag of ginger snaps and was leary - I have not had much success in finding comparable substitutes for the real thing.<br /><br />These cookies blew me away!  They are crunchy, spicy, sweet and all around as close to "the real thing" as I have encountered in a long while!  I would recommend that you try just one bag first from your local health food store to see if it will work for you before committing to a case - but I LOVE them!

I couldn't handle the texture and taste of the rice flour or the mixes i purchased. I was about to give up on finding a good wheat cookie substitute and decided to try these, even though the packaging did not make them look appetizing at all.  To my surprise these cookies tasted like the real thing.  I am very happy and will continue purchasing these from now on whenever i feel like i need a treat and will not feel sorry for myself any more. Thanks Pamela!!

review/summary: INCREDIBLE FLAVOR, BUT.....
review/text: I purchased these along with Pamela's gingersnaps. The ginger snaps were not that great to me: too sweet and sandy tasting. The extreme chocolate mini cookies were delicious! The flavor was extra-chocolately (I love dark, slightly bitter chocolate, so for me, I was in chocolate heaven) and I COULD NOT STOP EATING THEM: ate one entire bag in less than an hour....YIKES....:-) With this said, I could not give this product a 5-star rating, because I noticed the next day that my stomach was burning very much.  I don't know for certain if the culprit are the cookies, but my diet was not different aside from the cookies, which admittedly was an overindulgence on my part, so perhaps this is why my stomach was on fire. I have eaten overindulged in other foods which have not given me the same result as these. Also, they were a little too crumbly and dry,(sandy) but the taste was so spectacular that these cookies earned additional points; otherwise, I would have rated them 2 stars. So, for those with sensitive stomaches be forewarned, you may experience burning, esp. if eaten in excess. After nearing the end of the bag of these cookies, I noticed that I became satieted with the flavor/taste. I don't know if this means that I won't feel the need to eat the entire bag of the next bag. If I do, I will try my best not to eat more than 10/12 cookies a day. And, finally, these cookies also stuck to my teeth. I had to rinse with an anti-cavity rinse (twice), floss, and brush my teeth (twice) with toothpaste.

review/summary: Gluten-Free Greatness!
review/text: I love these cookies!  If you are gluten-free, you know how hard it is to find products that taste as good as their "regular" counterparts.  Pamela's Products usually do, in my experience.  And these cookies are my favorite Pamela's product.  I guess in my book that makes them the best of the best!  And Amazon's price is reasonable, as well.

review/text: My 11 yr. old son has been diagnosed with Celiac this year and loves the flavor of these cookies. They are crunchy and just the right size to pop in your mouth! They stay fresh for a long time and transport well in a ziplock bag for lunch at school. We have tried lots of GF products and Pamela's are the best!

review/summary: The best gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on the market
review/text: I feel like I have tried all of the gluten-free chocolate chip cookies on the market, and these are the clear front-runners for me.  Njoy Life usually has wonderful stuff, but their chocolate chip cookies don't hold a candle to these.  These are also better than Pamela's shortbread chocolate chip cookies and her chocolate chocolate chip cookies.  I saw someone compared them to Chips Ahoy, and I would agree with that.  Whoever said that you can't taste the chocolate chips must not have tried many other GF chocolate chip cookies, because there are many worse tasting ones out there.

review/text: I guess I'm weird.  This is the only Pamela's product that I did not like.  I love the full-size dark chocolate-chocolate chunk cookie, but the Simplebites had a bitterness I just did not care for.  My husband (who eats gluten) liked them much better than I did.<br /><br />I'll let all you 5-star folks have these; I'll have the Simplebites regular chocolate chip mini cookies, or the aforementioned dark chocolate chocolate chip cookies, thank you very much.

review/summary: Better from the store
review/text: I first purchased these cookies at our local health-food store and fell in love with them. They were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside--heaven. I decided to purchase them on Amazon since it was more cost-effective, and I was pretty disappointed with them. They tasted old and crumbly. My advice is find a store that carries them and pay the extra money. It's worth it.

review/summary: Finally, a GF ginger snap!
review/text: Okay, so they aren't as chewy as the wheat version of a ginger molasses cookie.  They don't quite *snap* like the wheat version of ginger snaps.  Like a lot of gluten-free cookies, they're more crumbly than chewy.  On the other hand, they do give a good kick of that ginger taste I have missed since I have began avoiding wheat years ago.  I also like that these don't have corn in the ingredients list- just rice and tapioca for flour.  So many of the GF alternatives use corn flour, which might work for Celiacs but doesn't always work for those of us who have intolerances that include corn.  I am pretty keen on the idea that I could pulverize these in the food processor and use them for a graham cracker crust.  I think they'd be phenomenal in a trifle or as a pressed crumb layer of a layered cookie.  I've been pretty happy with the Pamela's line of GF products, and this one did not let me down.  This product is going on my permanent Amazon shopping list.

review/summary: NOT MY FAVORITE
review/text: I was expecting something a little more snappy and a little less sandy. The flavor was okay (I personally love strong ginger flavors, which I am yet to find) however, they were too sweet for my tastes. I don't know, but it seems like Americans have a strong taste for excess sugar. It would have been better if there was less sugar and more spice, as well as less sandiness and more snappiness, imho. For those who like chocolate, try the extreme chocolate cookies, but be careful as they may cause burning of the stomache; esp. if many are eaten. Not my favorite Pamela's product.

review/text: This Ginger Snap would be my favorite cookie even if I weren't gluten intolerant and could eat<br />any type of cookie I wanted. The perfect amount of crunch...better than the Pamela's full sized<br />ginger snap which is a bit soggy, but more gingery...<br /><br />Crumbled it's great for a pie crust..but generally I just eat a few after dinner with coffee or tea.<br /><br />I've made mini ice cream sandwiches for my grandkids..I put<br />softened ice cream between two cookies, roll sides in mini chocolate chips, then put the little sandwiches back in the freezer. Good for adults who want portion control or tiny treats without going overboard.. I've made mini s'mores with them too... Once the package of cookies has been opened, I keep them in my refrigerator.  Keeps them crunchy and fresh tasting.
