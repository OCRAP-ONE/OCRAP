review/text: I do not typically drink coffee, just because I never got into the habit. However, if and when I feel the need for a little Joe, this is the coffee I will drink. EVERYONE NEEDS TO TRY THIS ONE! After educating myself a little on coffee roasting and roasting standards, I know Community Coffee is the best coffee in the south. i can not believe that Star-bux even stays open down here. Seriously, they don't hold a candle to Community Coffee! My parents drink CC, their parents drink CC, and THEIR parents drink CC! Cafe Special is a great coffee to start with if you are a first-timer.

review/text: I normally buy Eight O'clock Coffee-100% Arabica beans. Amazon didn't have my normal subscription order so I went looking for another brand. Unfortunately I chose this one and won't make that mistake again. It's a very weak coffee and you need to use a lot more than you normally would, and it has a 'off' taste. Not recommended at all.<br /><br />Until I can get Eight O'clock again, I'll buy Dunkin Donuts coffee.

review/text: I keep trying all the various French Roast coffees available through Amazon, based on what others have posted.  This Raven's Brew Ebony Pearls Whole Bean is the best I've tried.  I think I've tried 2 or 3 other Raven's Brew coffees, but they were not rich enough for my taste and I also have tried a couple of Cameron's.  Next on my list is First Colony which I used for over 40 years until they ceased production and sold to White Coffee.  I'd like to try 2 pounds of their coffee first before I commit to purchasing a 5 pound bag, so for the time being, I'm sticking with theEbony Pearls.

review/summary: Surprising winner
review/text: St Dalfour offers a variety of spreads, notable for their reasonable price, about half the sugars of ordinary brands, and pleasing taste. Kumquat may their least popular flavor, but it's actually reminiscent of marmalade, with a touch of apricot that makes it a distinctive pick. Kumquat is unfamiliar to many, but it's also about 30% less than more popular fruit, but it's ideal as a complement for toast or crackers. St. Dalfour has seized the market on this spread, but its distribution online through health stores make this relatively hard to find. But this spread is a real winner: mildly sweet (thanks to the addition of grape fruit concentrate - its only sweetener), but never cloying. While other spreads lose their personality through too much sugar, St. Dalfours gets the balance right. Flavorful, with real personality.<br /><br />This spread is destined for success.

review/text: My biggest concern was where these came from, which was nowhere to be found in the product description. According to the box they're from the USA, which was important to me! My only complaint is that some parts of the hoof walls are thin, making it easy for my Border Terrier to chew off small pieces and try to eat them. So far that hasn't caused a problem. Other than that these are a good product and a much better deal that buying singles at the big box stores.

review/summary: These are our puppy's favorite!
review/text: I started putting these in my puppy's Puppy Kong, and she LOVES them.  I stick them in as far as they go, and she has to squash the KONG while she pulls it out, or it gets stuck and she has to nibble on the end and slowly pull it out.  Sometimes these get stuck and you have to use something to poke it back out so the dog can get to it again.<br /><br />I highly recommend these, as they are a great variation from the little KONG-shaped biscuits, and from dog kibble.  Also, it seems like they must taste great, because when I put these in her KONG, my puppy will keep working on eating this treat (putting other things inside only catches her attention for a little while).

When I stuff her kong with these she won't leave it alone until it's completely gone.

Definitely recommend.

She immediately told me that Duke doesn't like any chewies and she's tried a whole bunch.  He just leaves them laying around.  I said...well...I've got them here, it's a premium product with outstanding ingredients, so let's just see what happens when we offer him one.  You know the end of this story...Duke at first sniffed suspiciously but then ate the Zuke's Z-Chew.  Denna stood there like she was in shock.  So, we found a chewie treat that Duke likes and it's really good for him too.  Yeah!  I'm really sorry that someone else's dog threw up the pieces.  If that happened soon after eating the Z-chew then there was no time for anything to get digested.  Everybody's stomach is different...human or canine.

review/summary: My Dog Loves Zukes Cranberry Bones!
review/text: Full disclosure: I haven't chewed on these bones myself--this review is based on what I perceive is my dog's opinion. ;-)<br /><br />Zukes cranberry bones are my dog's favorite bones, paws down. She seems like the other flavors, but the cranberry ones are the ones that literally make her drool as I had them to her. I love that they take quite a bit of time for her to chew (a couple hours), they don't stain the carpet and that they make her breath fresh and her teeth clean. She's a 45-50 pound Australian Shepherd and the small size is perfect for her. I've bought the medium for her in the past, which she loves, but it's really probably too many empty calories for her size, so I switched to the small. I'm very appreciative that they have a pleasant, slightly earthy, odor--so many dog treats smell really rancid, because there for, you know, dogs who are into stinky things. Also, my dog's got a sensitive stomach and has never had any trouble with any of the Zukes bones. While they're not cheap, they do what they're supposed to do, so I can't complain.

review/summary: My dog loves Zuke's Z-Ridge Bones.
review/text: My dog is crazy about these bones. They do a great job of keeping her teeth clean and the ingredients do not include a lot of the "garbage" found in most dental chews on the market. The medium size (recommended for 46-80 lb dog) only lasts about 20 minutes for my 55 lb. boxer mix. I prefer the large size (81 lbs. and up) for her. She can make one bone last for a day or two which is more satisfying to her and cost effective for me.

review/summary: I think he likes them.  But not as much as Greenies.
review/text: We have a little Maltese that is given a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> every day.  I saw the Zuke's Z-Ridge and thought they might be a good alternative to the Greenies.<br /><br />I will say that our dog can be weird.  When he gets dry dog biscuits he will hide them, then go back later and eat them.  He does the same with these.  I don't know if that means he really loves them, or if he just feels kind of "meh" about them.  I will say that he devours his Greenies.<br /><br />If you look at cost comparison, these things are almost a buck a piece, while the Greenies are only about a quarter a piece.  That right there makes me want to stick with the Greenies.<br /><br />I do think they work for breath freshness though.  Every once and awhile I'll give him one of these if he's getting a case of halitosis.  The only problem is that he keeps hiding it for half a day before he'll eat it.  I also use these if the little guy keeps bugging me.  That way he'll hide it instead of bugging me ;)<br /><br />I do like the Zuke's brand.  He loves the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007A0AP8">Zuke's Jerky Naturals Dog Treats, Lamb, 6-Ounce</a>.  That's why I wanted to try these.<br /><br />In all, I would recommend these to your pet.  If you're looking for an economical way to spoil your pet then I would go with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a>.

review/summary: Fantastic treat!
review/text: My dogs absolutely love these!  I have two dogs who can't have any grains at all, and one dog allergic to poultry, so discovering Z-Ridge bones was a wonderful thing.  The minis are perfect for my 10lb terrier, who has a tiny mouth (and consequently works on one of these for a few hours), but are just right for my insatiable chewers, two 15lb mixes (poodle and min-pin), although they chew them up within 10-15 minutes (size small keeps them busy longer, but it's easier to just buy one bag they all can have).  I read one review about these making their dog sick - like any hard treat, you should definitely keep an eye on your dogs when they're eating them, to make sure they're chewing the pieces.  They have never made my dogs throw up, and the ingredients used are all quite digestible (they're potato and vegetable-based).  However, if your dog is swallowing chunks without chewing properly, they'll vomit anything.  All in all, my dogs go nuts for these, in all flavors, and my neighbor's picky pitbull loves them too!

review/summary: Five stars, with caveat
review/text: My dog loves these!  He likes all the flavors, but carrot is his favorite.  He is allergic to corn and wheat, so he can't have greenies (fine by me, zukes is a better company anyway) or many other dental treats.  I give him a few per week and they make his breath smell nice for the day.  They shouldn't be used as a substitute for brushing your dog's teeth because they won't keep tartar build-up down and they shouldn't be given to dogs that "gulp" pieces, but if your dog chews before he swallows, these treats are a great option.  Thank you Zukes for making a dental treat my dog can have.

review/summary: Major skin allergies disappeared for our dog
review/text: Before I begin, I do want to say that every dog is different and what works for some won't work for others.<br />For us, we suffered for 11 years with severe skin allergies and infections.  Bloody lesions, ear and eye infections would plague our poor dog.  No matter what we did, change dog foods, use expensive antiseptics, administer even more expensive steroids and antibiotics, nothing helped.<br />I put her on probiotics.  I gingerly bathed her for years.  I cared for every lesion like a nurse in a war battle zone.<br />We then decided after consulting with our vet to stop all meds.  It just wasn't working and we were afraid it would do too much damage to her kidneys.  He said to try with food.  Get rid of all corn products and high preservative foods.<br />A friend suggested her dog's favorite 'Fish and Chips'.  She gave me the link to the website and I read up a little and ordered a small bag.  At that point, I figured, it couldn't hurt.<br />Well, that was 3 years ago and I can't say that it was all the magic of food but I honestly think it didn't hurt.  Our dog now has been lesion and infection free for three years.<br />I think the low corn and preservative content of this food has assisted us with maintaining a low allergen environment for her.<br />Now again, I preface, every dog is different.  For us, Flint River Ranch food is our go to food for all our dogs and we will probably continue with FRR for as long as possible.<br />If you want to try it, I recommend trying the sample packs.<br />You can get it cheaper and with free shipping at another website (1st result via google search for flint river ranch).

review/summary: Tastey Tea!
review/text: We simply LOVE this iced tea! We drink regular Tetley iced tea in the morning and this decaffeinated in the afternoon and evening. Having tried many different brands of decaf tea over the years this is the best we have ever had. Most decaf teas have a watered down flavor, not Tetley, it is full flavor iced tea. For Sweet Tea, I bring 2 1/2 quarts of water to a boil, turn off the heat, add 4 family sized tea bags stir around a bit then let steep in covered pot for about 10 minutes, stirring a couple of times. I remove tea bags and discard, then I add 2/3 Cup of sugar (while the tea is still hot) stir until fully disolved. Pour over ice and add water, if needed, to make it a full gallon. It also makes great unsweeted tea too. I cannot say that about any other brand I have tried. Tetley Iced Tea Blend (Regular and Decaffeinated) is very difficult to find in stores in my area, I am so thankful that I found it here on Amazon, I subscribed and now it comes to my door on a regular basis. It's the only beverage you will find in our house. I only wish I could give it more than 5 stars!<br />Written by Mrs.Dev-Dave

review/text: Had been purchasing Lipton Decaffinated Family size tea bags for years from Amazon.  Saw these, saw these were a little less expensive that Lipton.  We only buy these now, like the flavor a bit better - we drink A LOT of iced tea in Florida and I happen to mix a few decaf green tea bags with them.  These bags are round and not in the "paper wrappings" like Lipton, which is not an issue because I always have to keep in a tupperware/rubbermaid container after opening the boxes anyway to keep them fresh.  Anyone who doesn't isn't a tea drinker because paper wrapped or not tea starts becoming stale the minute the box is opened.  Someone should educate many restaurants who try to give me a non-foil wrapped tea bag, so I often bring my own.

review/text: We've tried Luzianne...it's good.  We've tried Lipton...it's bitter.  This Tetley Iced Tea blend has the robust tea flavor I like and NO CAFFEINE!  We limit our caffeine here to our coffee in the AM.  Otherwise we do decaf whatever else we drink. I love the rounds, as they have no strings and tags to clutter up my pot (I'm old school. I boil my tea on the stovetop and let it steep before I mix it).  And the flavor and color of this tea is excellent.  My southern roots love this bold flavor, smooth, tannic finish that makes me want to throw back a glass or 3 each day.  It's just plain good tea.  I'm just thankful I found it here.  (First found on clearance at my local Food Lion for $1.49/box.  Bought it out and won't drink anything else now.).  GREAT TEA...Great deal on here, too.  Do the subscription and save yourself a headache.

If you cut the ham into small pieces and mix it with a large amount of rice, beans, pasta, etc... then it would probably taste ok. But when mixed with a relatively small amount of noodles, the taste of the chemical preservatives is so overwhelming that it makes your snack/meal almost inedible. Having said that, everyone's taste preferences are slightly different, so you may want to pick up 1 can at your local grocery store and decide for yourself.

review/text: Since these cans of Ham are supposedly almost fat free, I was surprised that I found so much fat on the periphery of the can.  And it tastes like there is a salt shaker full of salt in each can too.  All in all I find these Hormel Chunk Lean Ham to be a bit on the disgusting side.  I will try using them for appetizers after adding onions, olives, chives, lots of pepper, celery, etc etc to try to smooth out the rather gross<br />taste onto crackers or roasted bread pieces.  A strong overwhelming salt taste can be subdued but it really requires a lot of work and forethought.  Don't expect a delicious HAM taste to be present though.  This is the first time I have tried these cans of lean ham but I will not be buying these again.  I DO NOT recommend them to anyone!

review/summary: Amazon to the rescue!
review/text: When this product (originally called tender-flake ham) became difficult to find in local grocery stores, I was SO relieved to discover I could order it from Amazon.  It's such a great staple to have on hand in the pantry, immediately available whenever it's needed, & staying fresh until then.  Try it as an alternative to tuna or ground beef, microwaved with handy "helper" pasta mixes, especially any cheesy ones.  (This is particularly convenient for anyone too old, too young, or too busy to comfortably tackle full-blown meal prep.)  Smashed up with some relish and either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a tasty ham salad to eat alone, on sandwiches, or on crackers.  In a rush (at work, for instance) it's not a bad snack smashed up & eaten as-is.  (Yes, if you read my review of Swanson canned white chicken, you'll see very similar suggestions there, but that doesn't make them any less true.)

review/summary: Makes a fantastic Caramel Matcha Latte!
review/text: I have always been a lover of all things caramel. I've probably tried every caramel cookie, cake, ice cream, tea, coffee, pastry, and countless other items that contain caramel. But I am very picky about caramel flavorings. Many of them taste too artificial, butterscotch-y, or are just too faint for me to enjoy. Happily, this Caramel Matcha did not disappoint me. When I received the package in the mail, I immediately knew my Matcha had arrived. There was a wonderful, strong smell of candy-like caramel coming from the package. After actually opening the package and smelling more caramel goodness, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />I decided to try this as a latte. So I prepared it using my usual method of 2 grams Matcha, 2 ounces of skim milk, 3-4 scoops of stevia, and 6 ounces of water. I whisked this up using my electric milk frother and tried it. It was very good, but a little strong. After adding another 2 ounces of water, it was close to perfection. This Matcha is very smooth and rich. Even though I used very little milk, it tasted so creamy. The caramel flavor is just right - enough flavor that you can definitely taste it, but not enough to outshine the flavor of the Matcha. This may be one of the best drinks I've ever made at home, and I'm actually kind of proud.

review/summary: Awesome flavor!
review/text: The flavoring is absolutely caramel.  No doubt about it.  It smells so rich and sweet you'd expect to get a sugar shock from drinking it, but it's only as sweet as the natural sweetness of a good matcha.  And the matcha base used is good!  The flavor isn't just some mask for an inferior tea!<br /><br />The color of this tea is a bit brownish.  Those who are used to the vibrant green of matcha may be a bit shocked at first, but the brownish tint is undoubtedly from the flavoring.  The awesome awesome flavoring.  Drink it straight for a decadent treat without the cavaties, or make it into a mind blowing latte.  yummy!  You can use it to add caramel flavor to anything!  caramel vanilla matcha milkshake?  Yes please!  Caramel matcha hot chocolate?  Mmmmm...no words.

review/summary: Matcha meets candy.
review/text: This matcha is awesome. I am a caramel addict, so sometimes I'll get something caramel flavored without really thinking about it, which was the case with this tea. But really, the flavors work really well together.<br /><br />The flavor almost reminds me of what I'd imagine green tea creme brulee would taste like. It's got the obvious green tea taste from the matcha itself, but then there's the sweet, creamy notes from the caramel. It's okay when it's hot and by itself, but I think it's vastly improved when it's made as an iced matcha latte. No sugar necessary there.<br /><br />Beyond drinking it, this seems like it would make an excellent flavor for cakes and ice cream. I am definitely going to give it a try in ice cream in the summer.

review/summary: Oh My Matcha
review/text: So in my search for the perfect vanilla (which I've now found in Red Leaf Tea's French Vanilla matcha), I've found that many caramel teas are close enough to temporarily satisfy me. But after a while I miss that vanilla creaminess and begin the hunt anew. Plus, caramel is my favorite sweet candy, though I prefer sour candies. But as a child who went through two sets of braces, caramel was not a treat I was allowed to indulge in often. But every Halloween I would buy a bag of those Caramel Apple suckers, braces be damned, and make them last for ages. My love affair with caramel has been a long and torrid one.<br /><br />Anyway, caramel brings out those feel-good feeling in me. So of course when I was ordering my Green Apple matcha from Red Leaf Teas, the caramel had to tumble into my cart too! I have to try them mixed, or I'll be doing my teenage self a grave disservice. But first, I'm going to try it by itself, with sugar added, of course. If it's anything like their French Vanilla, I'm in for a treat. I'm trying to try all of the new ones, but all I want to do is return to that little gem.<br /><br />On to the caramel! I'm only making a small cup of this as it is 9:30 at night and I want to sleep at some point. But hey, sleep is for the weak and matcha-less, right? Right. The smell is amazing. Like I just want to crawl into the package and spend the rest of forever there. The taste...mmm. Mmmmm....mmmm. Okay, it tastes like....mmmm. Maybe I needed a bigger cup. A soup bowl, perhaps. Guh...mmmm. It tastes like the French Vanilla, but with a lovely burnt sugar aftertaste that is rocking my world right now. It tastes like real caramel made on the stovetop with nothing but sugar, cream, and a big mess that is completely worth it. Mmmmm. When I was in high school, at a church carnival I won a caramel cake. It was a caramel-flavored cake that was laced with real caramel bits, caramel icing and drizzled with, you guessed it, caramel. This reminds me of that. Or the caramel pie from O'Charley's, which was essentially a pie crust filled with caramel. This is amazing, and I want to order some with the "There's matcha in this?" flavoring option so I can just drown in the caramelly goodness. This is a must-always-have-in-stock for me.

review/summary: Great Flavour!
review/text: I bought the caramel matcha more or less on a whim - it was on sale, so I could get a bigger size! Thinking back, I'm really glad I did. I am much more of a chocolate or vanilla person - caramel is not something that I normally lean towards. Red Leaf Tea hasn't steered me wrong yet! I am amazed at how much I like this!<br /><br />Dry, the caramel smell is strong and very distinctive. If I didn't know what flavour it was, I would have guessed correctly! In no way does it overwhelm or taste artificial though. I decided to take some to work with me, so I made it iced. It reminded me of a caramel version of chocolate milk - great flavour, creamy and all-round delicious. It was so good I even let two of my coworkers try it, and they agreed that it was heavenly.<br /><br />I find that my favourite way to have sweet flavoured matchas is as a latte or an iced latte, and I usually add a little bit of honey, depending on the specific flavour. My thermometer is currently m.i.a (I think it's at the bungalow) so I've just been letting the water get a little warm in the kettle and everything has been turning out great! I am thinking that caramel might become a staple flavour in my tea cupboard and I love having the chance to try so many wonderful flavours. I would highly recommend picking up some of this.<br /><br />I'd say that overall, this was my second favourite flavour (behind tiramisu) If you like caramel at all you should try this!

I like this best hot half matcha, half milk and marshmallows! The customer service is great if you have any problems or questions just ask them :D I also ordered with the tin since the bags aren't resealable. The small tin fits very nicely into my cupboard and helps my tea take up a lot less space! I recommend this to everyone!

review/summary: Great Tasting Matcha
review/text: I am the very definition of a beginning matcha drinker: I have never once even tried matcha before, much less made it myself. But I couldn't help but order one of Red Leaf Tea's myriad of flavored matchas. This one sounded delicious!<br /><br />The minute I cut open the foil envelope of matcha I was swamped with delicious caramel scent. Smelling it a bit closer brought out a kind of fruity aroma, which I assume must just be the matcha. It kind of reminded me of a caramel apple or something like that. Following the instructions on the brochure I ended up sifting 1.5tsp in my bowl (I was unsure on the instructions whether each scoop was supposed to be 0.5-1tsp, or two scoops was that total?). My very fine sieve (yay HomeGoods) worked well, and there were definitely more clumps than it first seemed, so I'm glad I sifted. I added a few ounces of water (though I didn't measure exactly how much) at about 180�F and whisked with my metal cooking whisk vigorously. It frothed pretty well but I think my technique is lacking! Right when the water hit the matcha I smelled a much stronger green tea flavor and a distinct earthiness, but not so much caramel.<br /><br />I took a sip, but it was pretty strong and bitter so I whisked some more, added more water and whisked some more. Better. Still a little bitter, but I am chalking that up to user error. Maybe I just need to add some sugar, too, since I tend to be a bit sensative to bitterness, but I didn't have any with me. Anyway, that kind of fruity caramel came through, the flavor blooming in the sip. The green tea wasn't too vegetal or in your face like I was fearing. The caramel was not as strong as I thought it would be, but it was present (and again that might be user error), and I did finish the entire bowl pretty fast! I am excited to try this in latte form, and I'm sure I will look up all kinds of tips and tricks for matcha now. I also wanted matcha to add to smoothies and to try some baking with it, and this seems like it would be amazing for both. I just bought some brownie mix at the store, and now I am thinking maybe some caramel matcha brownies? I don't know if the flavor would be drowned out, though. Research must be done!

I could not even go down to my local ice cream store and get something THIS delicious.

review/summary: A wonderful introduction to flavoured matcha!
review/text: It took me a long time to finally place an order for some Red Leaf Tea matcha, and now that I have it in my hands (and my tummy!) I wish I had have purchased it sooner.<br /><br />I was unsure whether I would find it too much of a fuss to prepare matcha myself, or whether I would enjoy the delicious sweet grassy taste of matcha paired with rich flavourings. Matcha seemed to me more like a tea you should enjoy on its own. But honestly, let me tell you, the caramel flavour and the bright, fresh matcha make a perfect coupling. And I have found the preparation to be much easier than expected!<br /><br />I have had other plain matchas before, but they simply do not compare in flavour or quality to this caramel matcha. So far I have tried it hot with no additions, and hot with milk and sugar. I much prefer it sweetened with milk, as that cuts down on the strength of the vegetal qualities of the matcha. It also really brings out the caramel sweetness. On its own I found it a bit too strong, but I tend to like milk and sugar in most of my teas.<br /><br />Overall I'm very glad I have some of this on hand now, and I can't wait to try out some of their other flavours. I have my eye on cheesecake, cotton candy, boysenberry, french vanilla, pear, and so many others! I think I may have found a new addiction. At least it's a healthy one!

review/summary: Caramel Matcha - very tasty and easy to make!
review/text: I'd say I'm a beginner with Matchas. I've never made a straight up cup of matcha, but I've had matcha pre-mixed with genmaicha teas. One of my favourite sushi joints has "iced green tea" which is matcha iced - excellent and refreshing with sushi! However in stores, I found matcha to be quite expensive. My local tea shops sold basic matchas with no fun flavors a little out of my price range to try a new kind of tea that I'm unsure is good, fresh and packaged right. Best prices I could find was in asian super markets. I've often purchased pre-measured matcha mixes or little tubs that stated it was for ice cream and baking. These mixes were still on the expensive side, so I used them sparingly to make smoothies or add to vanilla ice cream. The matcha mixes I disliked because they contained creamers and sweeteners thus calories I could do without. The unsweetened ones I found were often bitter and occasionally tasted like dirty grass.<br /><br />I saw Red Leaf's matchas reviewed at Steepster and became interested - so many different flavors! As a crazy tea drinker with a stash of over 100, I love interesting and fun tea blends, especially ones that have chocolate, exotic fruits, or caramel. Red Leaf has a big selection of various flavors. Personally, I never saw flavored matchas until I discovered Red Leaf's site. I had to order this Caramel Matcha!<br /><br />I then realized I have no traditional matcha gear, no bamboo whisk, funky spoons or bowl to prepare my matcha. I could of purchased it along with my order, but I had a tea budget to follow. I figured for now I'll make do with a tiny wire whisk, measuring spoon and a wide tea cup.<br /><br />My package arrived in a flat envelope, the matcha in a non resealable gold bag. My package also had a pamphlet on their various matchas and how to prepare it.<br /><br />TIME TO ENJOY MATCHA!<br /><br />Smell of the matcha powder - Strong grassy green tea smell with a spark of sweetness. From sniffing the matcha bag, I got green dust on the tip of my nose!<br /><br />First Cup - The Matcha Protein Smoothie<br />Red Leaf has a collection of matcha recipes to get you started. I followed the recipe on Red Leaf's website for the Matcha Smoothie with Protein Powder.<br />I used a frozen banana, fat free plain Silk soy milk, ON 100% soy protein vanilla powder and 2tsp of the Caramel Matcha.<br /><br />The colour of my smoothie is a milky yet dark matcha green. The caramel in the matcha is smooth and perfect strength that I can imagine it being gooey yummy. The banana adds extra depth and sweetness. I did not find the smoothie bitter or in need of additional sweeteners. The matcha and banana hid the protein powder taste. With that said, I figure this large smoothie was around 270 calories and is a great post workout smoothie that has 32g of protein. I'm going to make this smoothie again next time I lift weights.<br /><br />Second Cup - The Real Deal cup of Matcha<br />Using the instructions from the website, I carefully sift 1 tsp of the caramel matcha through a fine mesh tea pot strainer - it went surprisingly well and not messy at all.<br />Annoyingly, my hot water kettle does 185F (not 180F) so I went with 175F. I poured in about 1/3 of a cup of water and whisked away with my tiny wire whisk. It took a couple minutes to get a 1cm of delicious looking matcha froth. I then added a bit more hot water to taste.<br /><br />My cup was a beautiful deep green. The Caramel matcha is delicately flavored but with a full bodied green tea taste. Not watery or bitter or nasty grassy. The caramel is a fun present at the end of my sip and lingers as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Third Cup - The Matcha latte<br />I followed the same procedure I did for the hot cup of matcha, but added 2 tsp of sugar and topped the frothy matcha with soymilk and ice cubes. The result was very magical as the sugar and cold temperature makes the caramel pop more. I discovered it is possible to drink something and drool over it at the same time! This was better than lattes I've got from local coffee joints, much cheaper and less calories (with an additional plus that I can use the soy milk I like).<br /><br />From my first experience of steeping up my own real matcha, I found I have a new favorite tea. Red Leaf Tea's Caramel Matcha is tasty, better than anything I had from a mix or made from a coffee shop. I had more control over the amount of sweetener and milk.<br /><br />Red Leaf was very clear in their instructions on how to prepare matcha so a newbie like me could make a perfect cup.<br />With that said, I'm totally going to try more matchas from Red Leaf Teas. First, I think having a frother/hand mixer or bamboo whisk would of made the matcha frothing process go faster - especially for impatient "I need tea now!" types like me. of matcha would be fabulous.

review/summary: Fantastic flavored matcha & it's sugar-free!
review/text: Let me first tell you that before I was turned on to Read Leaf Tea, I would sometimes put in some good quality caramel sauce into my matcha lattes as a treat - I really do love good caramel flavoring! Thanks to this company, I don't have to do that anymore - AND I can control the sugar amount!<br /><br />Upon pouring out the contents of the robustly-flavored Caramel Green Matcha from the non-resealable, gold foil packaging into the tin, I could smell the sweetness of caramel. I HAD to make a bowl right then and there!<br /><br />For this first preparation I sifted a teaspoon of matcha powder into my bowl - I highly recommend doing this! Without it, you risk the chance of having clumpy matcha, and no one wants that! I wisked in two ounces of warmed water with my electric frother until the matcha was fully dissolved. Filled the bowl with the rest of the warmed water, about 6 ounces worth.<br /><br />I found the caramel missing an element - maybe it's sweetness, which is something I usually associate with caramel. While Red Leaf Tea doesn't add any sugar to their matchas, I found this benefited from some added sweetener.<br /><br />I also think I might prefer the Caramel Matcha prepared as a sweeter latte - either hot or cold.<br /><br />I do look forward to playing around with the Caramel Matcha more - mixing it with other flavored matchas from this company.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: In a word, this matcha is YUMMY!<br /><br />But, you probably want more than one word, so, I will add a few more!<br /><br />I love the sweet, delicious, creaminess of this flavored matcha.  Sure, I prefer unflavored Matcha most of the time, but sometimes I want to change things up a bit, and I love the selection of flavors that Red Leaf Tea offers, and the flavors are amazingly good.  This would make a great dessert substitute that is so delicious that you'll forget that it's quite good for you too!<br /><br />Really and truly yummy.  If you like caramel and you like Matcha, you're in for a treat with this.  If you're new to Matcha - this would be a really good starting point too ... then again, this is so delicious, it might be difficult to try something else if you start here!<br /><br />YUM!

review/summary: Practically perfect in every way
review/text: I love caramel and I would kill for this tea. I had no doubts about caramel and matcha working well together. I think that caramel makes magic with anything it touches. And it definitely makes magic with matcha. The flavor of the tea is like the best caramel candy I've ever had, only in liquid form so I can get more of it into me faster. It makes a killer latte and I'm sure it would be just amazing in baked goods. I can't wait to try a caramel matcha cake!

review/summary: Fantastic flavoured matcha!
review/text: I've been meaning to try Matcha again for quite a long time and this is my first foray back into it... it was well worth it. I traveled to Japan in 2009 and unknowingly had Matcha several times at random sushi restaurants, etc. It was interesting there but I just figured it was a normal green tea, nothing special right? Oh man, was I wrong! This stuff really is something to pay attention to, and the different flavor and health benefits possible with matcha are well beyond any standard green tea. This is really a fascinating beverage and I am excited to get back into it.<br /><br />Before this, I had never tried a flavoured matcha, in fact I had no idea such a thing could exist! Red Leaf pulls off the flavoured matcha with grace and skill, and offers a wild and impressive set of expected (vanilla bean, caramel, etc.) flavours and some wildly crazy and epic sounding ones (Coca Cola Matcha?!!!!) I am gonna have to try that one.<br /><br />I bought the Red Leaf Starter (Basic Grade), Delicate flavouring of Caramel Matcha. This is available on their site here: [...]<br /><br />Since I am a bit of a matcha newbie, I had to read their site about how to prepare it. It was very helpful. I got a whisk from Japantown and used a Chashaku (Bamboo Scoop) to measure out the matcha. I used 2 scoops and my first cup used the suggested amount, 3 oz of 80C water. I whisked it, poured it from the bowl to a mug and drank it from a mug, no extra water added. This was my previous experience with matcha in general, quite thick and vegetal. It was good.<br />In fact it was so good, I found myself going back to the kitchen to make a 2nd cup of it not 1 hr later!! This time I decided to change it up a bit, using only 1 scoop of matcha this time and a little less water, and then after whisking, adding a fair bit more water to reduce the thickness and make a larger drink. I think I actually enjoyed this better, it was a little sweeter this way and also allowed for a more tea-like experience (rather than a sort of "tea shot" like I had earlier). This was very tasty!<br /><br />These are the only ways I have prepared it so far but I think it might be wiser (for my unrefined palate!) to buy the "Distinctive" flavouring next time so that I can get a stronger flavor. This one is subtle, but I tend to enjoy stronger more bold flavourings in my tea, so I think the next one I get from Red Leaf I will pay just a little extra to get more flavouring. Excited to follow this new tasty and healthy habit!

review/text: Super product.  I got it first from someone who picked it up on sale from store going out of business. Fell in love with it but couldn't find it anywhere after that.  Put this in/on everything - salads, soups, BBQ chicken/fish, some stir-fry [not Asian-style], veggies--both fresh/raw and steamed, eggs of all kinds including egg salad, sandwiches - you name it.  Adds flavor without being overpowering like so many products can be. Excellent product.  Find it hard to believe anyone could not like it.

review/summary: this seasoning is awesome!
review/text: I love this seasoning! (Well, I love almost anything with garlic.)  I primarily use it in garden salads, pasta salads, and pasta sauce, but I also have put it in eggs.  I ordered it from Ozbo.  The product arrived on time and was just as I described.  Plus, the price was less than my local supermarket.  I won't hesitate to buy from Ozbo again.

review/text: This nothing but a box with dried beans and a baggy of spices.  It even calls for corn starch but doesn't include it.  If you want dried beans you can buy them much cheaper.  The spices were not as tasty as I like either.

review/summary: Easy and Tasty!
review/text: We made this mix with ground deer meat and cubed beef, it was delicious and so easy to make! All we did was slice the deer meat into a couple pieces and toss in some beef tips. Then added a can of diced tomatoes and turned the slow cooker on low while I was at work. Dinner was ready when we got home! Love it!! This one is great too <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005M49X84">American Pioneer 21 Bean Soup ( 6/13 Oz)</a>

review/text: I love chili!  This was the first chili that I have ever had that I really didn't like.  I cook a lot and have made chili from scratch and hoped this might be quick, easy and tasty.  I had to add so many additional ingredients to this chili that it wasn't worth buying.

review/summary: The Best Blue Kool-Aid
review/text: This is the Berry Blue Koolaid I drank as a kid in the late eighties. I remember the marketing blitz for it back then, I drank it a lot in the summer! The "Berry Blue" Kool-Aid out now is not the same ancient formula--this "Ice Blue Raspberry Lemonade" is. I know, I can taste this variety of Kool-Aid by just thinking about it. The blue color looks amazing in a glass pitcher--seemingly nuclear in origin! Delicious smooth lemonade type flavor without the sourness or bite. Unsweetened, so you can add your own sweetener.

review/summary: Best. Kool-aid. Ever.
review/text: I consumed a great deal of this in High School but have missed it the last few years as it has been removed from my local grocery store. I convinced my wife to let me buy this bulk amount and I am thrilled. Little note will be paid to these reviews but still I must say, you need to try this.
