review/text: I ordered these from Frito Lay India, they were stale. They also didnt taste that great otherwise. If your a fan of Indian food as I am, you may like these, but I guess I just expected more. My Indian buddy also broke the news to me that you can get these at certain Indian stores anyway, and ordering them online isnt necessary.

review/summary: At least it's available, BUT WAY too COSTLY - please lower the price!
review/text: Our family LOVES this cereal. I used to buy it regularly at the local Safeway. Unfortunately, as with the experience of many others, the local grocery store no longer carries it.<br /><br />When buying it at Safeway, I could find it quite often "on sale" for $2 per box - and that box was larger than the paltry 14-ouncers Amazon is peddling here (can't recall, but I believe it was an 18 oz size)<br /><br />A LITTLE ARITHMETIC:<br />1.  If I was buying 18 oz for $2, the price was 11 cents an ounce (even if the boxes were 14 oz, the price still would have been 14.3 cents per oz).<br />2.  Amazon is selling us 6 14 oz boxes (84 oz) for $25.14 (and telling us it is "discounted" from $28.89!). This amounts to 30 cents an ounce. You can get it down to 25.4 cents an ounce IF you agree to regular interval deliveries - something I'd be GLAD to do for the RIGHT PRICE!<br />NOTE: At 30 cents an ounce, we are paying $4.80 per pound - I can buy several punds of chicken, hamburger, or even a pretty good steak for that per-pound price.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  this great product seems to have disappeared from the local store shelves and, in order to get it, we now have to pay 2 to 3 times as much making grape nut flakes more costly than many meats. I suspect that this is very profitable and I'd rather be a seller than a buyer!!<br /><br />If anyone know of better pricing options, please post them!<br /><br />Also, POST and AMAZON, if you are listening, PLEASE see if you couldn't provide this absolutely great product at a little better price. Many thanks for reading.

review/summary: Subtle nutty flavor
review/text: I always liked Grape-Nuts Flakes better than Grape-Nuts.  The regular Grape-Nuts are too much like chewing gravel to me. The flakes have a great nutty flavor.  They do get soggy very quickly, though.  Sometimes I like them that way.  If you don't like soggy cereal, I recommend cutting the serving in half, eat the first half with milk, then add the second half to the remaining milk.  Or just eat fast :)

If you price on Amazon is not a mistake, then you might as well just throw them away!!!!<br />7 into 30 is over $7 plus shipping. ???  Insane.<br /><br />I have bought it from Amazon before, but this last Amazon ad says a 6 pack of 14 oz boxes for 55 dollars.  Say what! That's over $9 a box!!  That can't be right. Even half of that would still be too high.  Please check the prices.

review/summary: The best of cold cereals
review/text: This cereal is perfect.  Just a tiny bit sweet, made mostly of whole grains, and the flakes are light-thin-crispy.  The flakes do dissolve quickly which is why they are great for using in recipes.  I stir a cup of them in with one can of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDI5O8">Farmer's Market Foods Organic Canned Pumpkin, 15-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, add some ginger and cinnamon, and set it, covered, in the 'fridge for a thick cold healthy snack.  In the cooler months I bake the concoction.  From random in-store label comparisons I have concluded that Post uses better quality ingredients than the other big name cold cereal companies.  I was shocked at the pricing here at Amazon though.  My small grocery store, where generally the prices are rather high, charges less than four dollars for one fourteen ounce box.  So paying nearly ten dollars per box, which is what Amazon is currently charging, is pretty outrageous.  Boxes of the original Grapenuts can be had for a fraction of what the flakes are going for.  I'm glad I came here to read the reviews because it looks like possibly Grapenuts Flakes are becoming less available in stores.  I plan to stock up now while I can.

review/summary: A Versatile Adult Cereal
review/text: Post Grape Nuts Flakes are a great-tasting "adult" (not sugar-coated) cereal. The flakes are small-ish and tender, not like the huge, hard, milk-proof fodder that cereals like Wheaties and Bran Flakes have become, nor is the whole-grain flavor masked by sprayed-on vitamins. Adding some Sunmaid Zante Currants creates a light, sophisticated "raisin bran,"  and dried cranberries (such as Ocean Spray "Craisins") will tantalize your taste buds, too.  Mixing the Grape Nuts Flakes with Wheat Chex or Rice Chex adds even more variety.  I was glad to find that Grape Nuts Flakes were available at Amazon.com, as they are no longer available where I live.  I wish Amazon would stock the larger 18 oz. boxes as well.

I don't care for regular Grape Nuts but I can eat Grape Nuts FLAKES for breakfast every single day & never get sick of it! The fact that it is NOTHING like regular grape nuts( which is like eating gravel w/ milk & sugar) is a good thing!!  Flakes are great Plain or with fresh berries, sprinkled on top of yogurt...

review/summary: Not for the heavy chewer
review/text: Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup.  While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze.  After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric.  When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.<br /><br />Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes.  If you have a puppy that likes to 'throw' their toys or pounce on them, this can become a flying projectile.<br /><br />Though it did seem to help with the soreness of teething, and provide a cool treat, the overall experience left a lot to be desired.

And after the first use our moderate, non-teething dog had ripped out most of the stuffing, rendering it useless.<br /><br />The idea of a frozen toy is a good one, but freezing some knotted up towels would be just as effective.

review/summary: GOOD chew toy !!!
review/text: I have a German shepherd mix that isn't a heavy chewer but he's going through a faze of chewing so instead of losing my clothes to his teeth I got this. I got it locally but when I read the reviews on here I thought I would write my own. The fact is I love this I can freeze it over night and it will last for an hour or two or him just chewing on it, or I can freeze it for an hour or two and it will last about 15-20 minutes. It all depends on if I'm home or not. The point of this story is that I like this toy because he has stopped chewing on my clothes and started chewing on this and his kongs. (Which he wasnt before). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a dog going through a chewing faze.

review/summary: My puppy LOVES this toy
review/text: My puppy really loves this toy. I'm surprised to see all the negative reviews.<br /><br />I'd call him a heavy chewer, but he has not ripped the bone apart, and we've had it for a few weeks. He's little though (4 months old, 5.5 lbs) so maybe that's why.<br /><br />It's true that the bone doesn't stay frozen for very long. He likes it even after it's begun to thaw, though. He likes it when it's frozen, and he likes it when it's not frozen but cold and wet.<br /><br />Also, to the person who complained that the plastic bag broke: it's just a Ziploc bag. They're not supposed to last forever, and you can easily get another one.<br /><br />Many of the reviewers on here suggested using a frozen washcloth instead. I'm hesitant to do that because I don't want him to learn that it's ok to chew on towels.<br /><br />Bottom line: my puppy loves this toy, so I do too.

review/summary: No good
review/text: I bought this bone at Petco to help my pup keep cool on hot days. Not only did she chew a hole in it in the first few minutes, but it thaws out very fast and is just a soggy dog toy. Because it doesn't stay frozen long in 80 degree weather, it is easier to chew and tear holes in. I am just glad I bought it at half price and didn't waste a ton of money on it.<br /><br />If you are looking for something cool for your pup you are better off giving it an Ice Cube

review/summary: Good product as long as it's frozen!
review/text: I got this for my dog during the heat of summer since she loves eating ice so much! She likes this toy, although she gets bored with it very easily (I guess it's the crunch factor of ice she's missing) so it normally sits on the floor until it melts. Word to the wise, don't let your dog have this toy once it's thawed out - at least not if they're an extreme chewer like my dog. She put a hole in one of the corners within a few minutes since it's just canvas and stuffing. Probably my fault, but at least I was able to sew it up and she doesn't mess with the patched corner when it's frozen. I've learned my lesson to pick it up if she stops playing with it to avoid her destroying it completely. Overall, she seems to like it and it freezes pretty quickly!

review/summary: A popular product from a major movie
review/text: Although these delicious delicacies can stand on their own merit, they have a know reputation.  Everyone remembers the red stapler from "Offices Space" (1999). But only a connoisseur would associate gummy bears with "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" (1986). While Ed Rooney (Jeffrey Jones) was making his principal getaway on a school bus, a young lady offered him a gummy bear. It was warm and chewy as she kept them in her pocket.<br /><br />You do not need to keep these animals in your pocket to enjoy them. Just be aware that they may not blend well with temporary fillings. You can just suck on them in that case.

review/summary: Tremendous price but weak lapsang souchong
review/text: I couldn't believe the price on this tea, especially for lapsang souchong, my favorite black tea.  I read the other reviews on it and decided to give it a try.  My mistake; I now have a "ton" of tea (2 lbs) that, to my taste, has almost none of the l.s. smokey character.  If you want the distinctive smokey, almost peat-like flavor of l.s., don't bother with this one.  With some sugar, it was slightly reminiscent of l.s. (the only reason for my 2-stars instead of 1), so I guess I haven't totally wasted my money.  Honestly, I'm not even sure someone who only wants to sample the lightest l.s. flavor would feel rewarded with this brand (Coffee Bean Direct).  I won't buy it again, needless to say.

review/summary: Decent everyday tea & great value
review/text: Like many others, I couldn't believe the price of this tea given that lapsang souchong are usually fairly expensive. I can't say that it's the best souchong I've ever tasted but it wouldn't be fair to compare it to tea from a local gourmet tea shop selling LS 4-5$/oz, just like it's not fair to compare a Mercedes-Benz C330 to a Toyota Corolla. It is a great everyday tea.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not sure if it's a genuine LS tea since it almost taste like artificial smoke flavor was added to regular tea as opposed to drying tea over burning pine logs. The smokiness is subtle but strong enough to my liking. The aroma is also pleasant. And when you try a second brew, the smokiness really fades and the result is a standard black tea with a hint of smoke.

But above that the tea is excellent. The oolong is delicate and beautiful. the lapsang is strong and vibrant. I'm looking forward to ordering more just as soon as i get more room. 2 pounds of tea is a lot. As to the nay sayers who did not like this company's tea I say "rubbish" this tea is fantastic. ESPECIALLY at the price. What world do you live in that you can gourmet tea for around a dollar an ounce? These are perfect workaday teas. I do not not want  a tea that the price makes me wince when  I make a cuppa. So in summation brilliant teas from one of my new favorite tea houses.

review/summary: Decent alternative to Billy Tea - when you live in middle of nowhere
review/text: On a recent trip to Australia, my husband discovered Billy Tea with its lovely smokey flavor.  Unfortunately we live in the middle of nowhere & to get this tea loose-leaf you either have to drive 4 hours, or pay and arm & a leg for shipping.<br /><br />We decided to give this tea a try after googling "smokey flavored tea".  With subscribe & save and an additional $10 redemption code, we scored 2 pounds for $7 delivered.  Not too shabby for a shot in the dark.<br /><br />We brew this in our Keurig, and it has a nice flavor - but is on the weak side.  This could be due to the brewing in the Keurig vs. a teapot.  The smoke flavor is nice - noticable, but not too strong.  For the price - this was right.  But the quality has inspired us to try out different brands (higher quality) of Lapsang Souchong even if at a higher price.<br /><br />I would recommend this tea at the price of $17/2 pounds as a good value if you want to try out the Lapsang Souchang style of tea.

review/summary: Fun to make, but too dry
review/text: When I saw this product at one of my favorite kitchen stores, I just had to try it out, especially since I love this coffee cake and the Barefoot Contessa show.  I figured it would be a great mix.  I was very disappointed after baking the product that the cake itself was very dry and the crust was very hard.  The flavor was there, but might need to add pudding to the mix or something else to add moisture to it.  For the price of $14.95 that I had paid, it's probably worth it to just buy one already made from a local bakery.  Definitely not worth the price paid.  Sorry, Ina!

review/text: This is my sister's favorite type of cake. As teenagers we would make the Betty Crocker cinnamon swirl cake, which looked just like this one, and she was hoping for something similar.  After she tried to make this mix a couple times without success, she asked me to try.  I will say the overall flavor of this cake is really good, BUT it's very dense.  The crust is thick and hard for a cake and the crumb is very dry.  I tried using Plugra high fat butter, then substituting some of the butter with oil, and I even tried switching pans. I just could not get a moist cake from this mix.

When we first started making it, we had an old inexpensive bundt pan; and, like the other reviewers, we thought the coffeecake was tasty, but a little dry.  After making it in a new higher quality bundt pan that we received for Christmas, the outcome improved 100%.  I guess it's true what they say about having the right "tool" for the job.  I have also noticed that I get a better result when I reduce the cooking time slightly on all of the Barefoot Contessa mixes.  We'll keep buying this as long as they offer it.

review/text: Milo is like Hershey's powder, except it stays crunchy on top! So you mix it with cold milk, you let the crunchy part soak in the milk for a minute, then eat the crunchy part with a spoon, then drink the chocolate milk!  I tried it in Australia 30 years ago and can't believe it has never been introduced in the U.S.!!

review/summary: Delicious sparkling water
review/text: This is delicious lemon lime sparkling water. I had never heard of this brand before and decided to give it a try - glad I did. Once I received it I immediately put one in the refrigerator. Later when it was cold I tried it and it was very refreshing. Just the right amount of bubbles and lemon lime flavor. This is a healthy alternative to soda. I look forward to trying TalkingRain's other flavors of sparkling water.

review/summary: TalkingRain Sparkling(Lemon Lime)
review/text: This water has a very strong taste for me, but my sister really likes it.  If you freeze it, make sure to drink a least a 1/4 of it or you will get a science experimental explosion in your freezer.  Make sure, you check on it and release the top to let the gas out of the bottle. Being frozen, it is like a slushy.  Now, the price is really*really reasonable.  Make sure you click on the standard shipping (I think it says 5 to 8 days) takes longer, but free shipping. Saves the consumer lots of shipping cost!!!  With that saving on shipping, the consumer can spend more on the products.

review/summary: Fabulous alternative to sugary beverages
review/text: For a variety of reasons, I wanted to stop consuming sugary beverages such as soda and juice.  Many zero calorie beverages have artificial sweeteners, which I feel are generally unhealthy, potentially carcinogenic, and also not very tasty.  However, I'm not a big fan of plain water as I just really don't like the taste.  Talking rain sparkling water is a fabulous alternative.  It's extremely tasty, contains no sugar, has no unpronounceable ingredients, and is very affordable.  Basically, the lemon-lime flavor is subtle, and combined with the fizzy-ness, results in a very pleasant beverage.  The price for these bottles is, per unit volume, comparable to what 2L bottles are sold at in my local grocery store.<br /><br />The only drawback is that all these small bottles are not a very environmentally friendly option.  Hopefully Amazon will start selling the 2L bottles in bulk at some point.

review/summary: There's Only Word To Describe This Beverage: PERFECT
review/text: I enjoy sampling new products and recently my search has been focused on flavored sparkling water. In New York City, there are so many varieties to select from and sometimes it gets overwhelming. I often settle for Perrier or Pellegrino and mix them with flavored juices. To make a long story short, something I have never quite mastered, I noticed an unfamiliar looking bottle mixed in with the others at a cafe on my block. Reading the nutrition label, seeing 0% fat was enough for me when it comes to meeting my nutritional requirements. My friend told me to go with 'Pink Grapefruit.' He tried it the day before and said it was delicious. He was 100% right. My biggest concern at the moment is which flavor will I try tomorrow. The sparkle is not as intense as is the case with most drinks and the grapefruit flavor was  just right. It went down nice and smoothly. Seriously, I never reviewed anything but books until now. Once I sample a few more flavors, I will place my bulk order with Amazon. 0% calories and so delicious. Remarkable!<br /><br />Laurie Siegel<br />New York City, N.Y.

review/summary: Better than soy sauce, same consistency
review/text: I've always been a big fan of Japanese Teriyaki, and every once in a while I used to go through a local drive through that served a steaming hot bowl of rice topped with sliced grilled chicken breast and topped with their thick, sweet teriyaki sauce. It was absolutely delicious and very cheap, but unfortunately they went out of business.<br /><br />In the meantime I stopped eating teriyaki because I didn't realize there was a thinner version, more like soy sauce. Enter: Kikkoman Teriyaki Marinade and Sauce. I was at the store looking to pick up some soy sauce when this caught my eye. I was surprised at how thin it was, it has the consistency of soy sauce. I was very pleasantly surprised when I got home and cooked up a pot of basmati rice and topped it with this teriyaki sauce, it was wonderful. It's slightly sweet, full of flavor, and has 610 mg of sodium vs. 920 mg of sodium in one tablespoon of soy sauce.<br /><br />I now always prefer this to soy sauce and it's become a staple in our household.

review/text: I used to by my bertoli or similar extra virgin olive oil at my local stores - then from watching Mario Batali on the food network I got curious to how different the more expensive oils could be, Mario always said that "if they dont let you taste it before you buy it, go somewhere else" - that is not an option where I live, there are no stores like that around here, I would have to drive an hour and a half. So I just figured that the oil Mario uses is probably pretty good, I found it online a few years ago and have ordered it ever since, it truly is awesome, I cook with it, fry in it, make dressings and whatnot, it really is WAY better than the standard EV's you find in supermarkets...

review/text: I love this olive oil.  I have a source locally, so I don't have to order it.  I use it for everything except deep frying; we're talking raw oil to high heat cooking.  I know that defies common logic, but look at it like this:  if you love the taste of an olive oil raw, you'll love it cooked too.  This oil is intensely fruity with a wonderful pepper finish.  If you want a consistently good olive oil for all of your cooking needs, I highly recommend Frantoia.  The only reason I don't deep fry with it is because it's cost prohibitive.  For EVERY other olive oil use, I turn to Frantoia, and I've never been let down.
