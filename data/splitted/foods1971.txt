review/summary: Love the Organic Green Puffs & the price with subscribe & save
review/text: We started with the Gerber puffs from our local grocery store when our son was 7 months old.  I prefer organic products but our local grocer did not carry this item so I took the plunge and ordered these after reading the good reviews.  I'm so glad we made the switch!  These containers are larger at 2.1ozs than the Gerber Puffs at 1.48ozs, so not only are you getting a healthier product for your child - you're actually saving money!  If you do a side by side comparison on ingredients and nutrition this product is by far superior.  And they do taste great - even my 7 year old that avoids green vegetables thinks these are yummy.  We're keeping these on our subscribe and save list - thanks Amazon for offering a great product at an incredible price. :)

review/summary: Good Ingredients; Jack Russell loves it.
review/text: My dog absolutely devoured his food with this on it. This product contains just about every known ingredient available for joint health. In case you are like me, and want to know what's in your pet's products, here's the list (amounts are per serving, 60 servings per container):<br /><br />Glucosamine (from shellfish), 500 mg.<br />Algae from spirulina & alfalfa, 285 mg.<br />MSM, 250 mg.<br />Herbal blend: Meadowsweet, Stinging Nettle, Ginger, Turmeric, & Bromelain (the bromelain is a proteolytic enzyme) concentrated 210 mg,(1100 mg crude herb equivalent)<br />Green Mussel extract, 100 mg.<br />Omega blend from wild salmon, cod, and tuna oil, 75 mg.<br />Inactive ingredients: cinnamon, cloves, sweet salmon flavor, flax, silica, barley malt.<br /><br />If you have done any research into these ingredients you know that it's a great combination. I can't tell you how effective it is, because I got it for prevention rather than treatment. My Jack Russel Terrier just reached senior status in dog years and I want him to keep his joints healthy!<br /><br />And now I'll get to what I feel is an important consideration....My main reason for giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is a statement on the label that says "For use in dogs only". I don't like to give my dog anything unless it is fit for human consumption (I order his dog food online). The 'for dogs only' statement makes me wonder if the omegas 3's are processed properly, and if the flax is fresh (it becomes rancid easily). These are things even humans need to be aware of when shopping in a health food store. I'll give this product the benefit of the doubt since my dog loves it so much, but that statement is an eyebrow raiser for me.<br />Oh, one more thing...as the jar says, turmeric can be a little hard on the stomach, so make sure you give with food then watch your dog for signs of stomach discomfort. Most dogs should be able to tolerate it. It is a Great anti-inflammatory & has numerous other health benefits. (google it!)

review/summary: Healthy Motion Powder
review/text: I have an eleven year old Labrador retriever that weighs about 65 pounds and we administered 1 ï¿½ tablespoons a day.<br />He has hip problems, and spends a lot more time just laying down than he used to.<br /><br /> The container is half full after opening and it smells like a light grassy herbal tea and the powder looks like dirt.<br />The flavor is salmon which my dog was not too happy about. When I sprinkle it on his food, he mournfully looks up at me as if to say "I don't know what I did, but I am SO sorry.  Why are you ruining my food?" He will stare at his food for several minutes and walk by the cats and "ask" if they are finished yet. Eventually, he'll give in and eat his own food - which is good because I have seen results.<br /><br />I've noticed that he has a bit more pep in his step. He seems happier and doesn't lie down as much. This was especially noticeable on bath day. When it's time for his bath (and he ALWAYS knows) he won't come when I call. He'll just lay there and stare at me with bleary eyes - even if I slide his motionless body all the way to door, like he's Ghandi or something. After a few weeks of motion powder, he came trotting along - ready for bath time.<br /><br />And instead morosely marching onto the driveway, ready for his walk, he comes galumphing out of the house and will even run around the block for a bit (which he hasn't done in years). If only they made this stuff in a more palatable flavor. What kind of dog eats salmon? It should be chicken, liver or beef flavored instead. I also think it would be better if it came with a scoop and in pellet form because the powder would fall to the bottom of the bowl. I think my dog would enjoy this with his food more.<br /><br />Despite my glowing praise - this is NOT some fountain of youth for your dog. My dog still tires quickly and still loves laying around. However, I think it makes the little things in his life a bit easier for him. And after all, it's the little things in life that matter.

review/summary: My Dogs LOVE the Flavor - And It Works
review/text: I have a 7 year-old Border Collie mix, Abbey, who has arthritic knees.  She had bilateral arthroscopic knee surgery about a year and a half ago to remove broken bone fragments in her joints. Our vet instructed me to give her an oral glucosamine supplement for the rest of her life.  Abbey also gets a glucosamine injection, Adequan, every other week. My vet allows me to administer it myself (at home) to save on vet bills.<br /><br />The injection turned out to be the simple part. Abbey hated the glucosamine supplement we got from our vet. I had to wrap it in cheese or something, and she usually spit it out once or twice before it went down.  She tends to be a little overweight, so the added calories from cheese and other disguises were a negative.  I tried several different brands of glucosamine tablets, and she refused every one.<br /><br />A couple of months ago, my local Petco had a close-out sale on Healthy Motion, so I thought we'd give it try.  I opened it and immediately noticed the spicy scent. It smells kind of like Indian food spices.  To my great surprise, Abbey and two other dogs came looking before I opened their wet food.  It turns out that three of my four dogs PREFER the Healthy Motion-sprinkled food to their otherwise identical wet & dry mixed dinner.<br /><br />It works! After using it for 2-3 weeks, I noticed that Abbey has more energy and is moving better. Finally, something that is both effective and palatable to her.  She looks forward to it and licks up every speck.

review/text: My wife and I have 13 dogs, half of whom are older, and several of whom have severe arthritis. While my wife, who is a pet nutritionist, likes the ingredients, she doesn't like the price. That's why I had to give GreenDog Naturals four instead of five stars. If you can afford it, this powder seems to appeal when mixed with your dog's normal food. It also seems to help our older dogs move better after several weeks of use.

review/text: My 7 year old Lab has had some hip issues the last year and this powder seems to have helped with her mobility. She really doesn't like the taste of it, she eats her food with the powder on it almost begrudgingly. I've noticed since we started using this powder that she seems more active and playful then she had been in the months prior.<br />That being said, the powder is inconvenient and a bit messy, not to mention the fact that my dog doesn't enjoy it. If this were in a tablet or even liquid (like a tincture) form, it would be a five star review.

review/summary: Dog doesn't mind the taste, haven't noticed a huge change.
review/text: I have a 20# Boston Terrier (a breed known for knee joint issues) so I thought this would be a good product to try with her. Unfortunately, after using for over a month, I haven't seen any specific and obvious improvements. However, to be honest, she wasn't currently experiencing any issues when I started her on the powder, so I am using it as preventative care. She doesn't seem to mind the taste at all and even though it's going on dry food, she still manages to ingest most of it. I use it probably 4-5 times a week and have been giving her 1 tsp a time and we still have quite a bit of the powder left...so for us it's not that bad of a deal. We will probably buy continue buying it off and on as she gets older and/or has actual knee issues (which come and go with her level of activity).

She has an old ACL injury that has previously made it difficult for her to get up stairs or jump on a chair (yes, she is spoiled).  I mix it with her food at night and it either tastes good, or has little taste, as she is a bit finicky and has had no problem eating it.  She is definitely stepping more lively.

review/summary: Worth a try for older dogs
review/text: I have a 75lb, 10 year old Doberman-Weimaraner mix. He's been having slight joint issues that I've noticed lately. He's stiff walking around, having a bit of difficulty with the stairs & getting into the car.<br /><br />The main draw for me was the Glucosamine. I've been looking for a product safe to give a dog for the while and liked the sound of GreenDog. I've been sprinkling 1 teaspoon on his food once a day for the past two weeks. (The directions list a bit more for his size, but I'd rather err on the side of caution.) It's difficult to say how effective a product is from only two weeks of use, but he doesn't seem to mind it on his food. He doesn't go crazy for it either; rather he seems to not mind either way.<br /><br />I was very surprised by the very herb-y smell! I almost hesitated to give it to him (it certainly smells more like human food than dog food) & took another look at the ingredients.<br />The ingredients listed:<br />Gluosamine HCI (shellfish source)<br />Proprietary Organic Antioxidant Blend (organic algae meal, organic alfalfa)<br />Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM)<br />Proprietary Joint Comfort Blend (Meadowsweet, Bromelain, Stinging Nettle tops, Ginger, Tumeric<br />Green Lipped Mussel Extract<br />Proprietary Ocean-source Omega Blend<br />(Wild salmon, cod, tuna oil)<br />Inactive ingredients (Cinnamon, cloves, natural sweet salmon flavor, organic flax, silica, sprouted barley malt)<br /><br />He's seemed a bit more playful lately. Though I'm not positive this was a result of the GreenDog Motion Powder I'm certainly not ruling it out. Overall, I will recommend this to friends with older dogs. I do encourage anyone to consult their veterinarian of course. If he shows improvement I'm more than happy to order more of the Motion Powder.

review/summary: Nutritionally Sound
review/text: I received this product in return for writing a review.<br /><br />I appreciated the ingredients of this formulation, which are great for overall health as well as bone/joint health.  I am not a nutrition expert but I am somewhat knowledgeable and though the nutritional requirements might be different in some ways, dogs are mammals.<br /><br />One reviewer stated that it doesn't work well with dry food and I wholeheartedly agree.  It falls to the bottom rapidly.<br /><br />Now, I feed my dogs organic dog food (since they could eat solid food and they are 12 and 11.  My dogs love vegetables, so I conducted a test.  I dusted a vegetable with the powder.  Yorkie #1 didn't know what to think and spit the veggie out but immediately after "contemplating" the taste and she returned to broccoli and ate the entire piece. Yorkie #2 didn't pause once she got her broccoli with the powder.<br /><br />Next, I offered two identically sized broccoli pieces one dusted with the powder and one without powder.  Yorkie #1 ate the coated one first.  Yorkie #2 went for the uncoated piece first.  Considering that they are a bit picky but absolutely love fruits and vegetables, if they didn't want to eat this food, I believe both would leave the coated piece behind.<br /><br />I do believe that this is not "candy" but has some appeal.<br /><br />However, that said, it doesn't coat even wet vegetables well.<br /><br />I would consider buying the drops for regular use but I would definitely need to observe a noticeable improvement in their well being to justify the cost.

review/summary: A Healthier Alternative For Your Dog's Joints
review/text: My dog is getting old and is just starting to have some  difficulties with his hips.  I've tried other products for dogs containing glucosamine, but wasn't very happy about the animal products in them, because I know too much about where those animal products come from and how they're processed, and prefer not to feed them to my dog. (One reviewer of this product, wishing for a chicken or beef flavor, asked, "What kind of dog eats salmon?" The answer: mine, every day.  He loves it,and for twelve years old he's pretty darn healthy.)<br /><br />Unlike some of the dogs mentioned in other reviews, my dog loves the flavor of this.  The ingredients are exceptionally well thought out--they're not fillers.  For example, ginger and turmeric are known to have anti-inflammatory properties, but dogs may not particularly like them in their raw form. Omega-3 fatty acids are also effective.<br /><br />Does it help?  After two weeks, I'd say maybe; since my dog doesn't have a major problem, any change wouldn't likely be dramatic, but he doesn't seem quite so creaky.<br /><br />For a larger dog, the product, while reasonably priced considering the ingredients, can get a little pricey if you expect to use it consistently, and I believe with this type of supplement that's what you'll have to do if you want to get results and keep them. This 150-gram size will only last a few weeks. But I haven't found a better product of this type.

Purely on the sake of time, I won't continue to feed it to my dog on a regular basis.

review/summary: get the pills if you feed your dog dry dog food
review/text: I can't tell if this works or not, so I'm giving it three stars for the fact that I have to review it, but it's the wrong type to feed my dog who eats dry dog food. It doesn't cling, it falls to the bottom of the bowl and she picks through her food as she's an oldie and nibbles at her food. I could switch to wet food to get her to eat it, but I'm just going to go back to the pills. The glucosamine pills and the doggy cox2 inhibitor she takes have changed her life. She's old, so that's saying something. If you feed your dog canned/wet food this might be a good choice, but if it's dry food and they don't wolf it down, it defeats the purpose. Wish I could say more.But my final thought on this is that something in the product description should recommend this for wet dog food.

review/text: To say Doogan likes this product is an understatement.  It must have been the salmon flavor but we had 157 pounds of happy nose, happy feet and happy tail when GreenDog naturals Healthy Motion Powder was added to the food dish.  Our Vet said that with a dog this big, who is getting up there in years, the addition of Glucosamine to the diet is a good way to insure ease of motion to the old joints.  Of course the prospect of giving a dog a medication always instills terror in the hearts of well meaning pet owners.  Giving medicine to an animal that has the power to pick you up and carry you off to the next county can be quite a feat - but - "HE LIKES IT" - yes, he really, really likes it.<br /><br />The only reason that this product did not get a 5 star rating is that upon opening the box the label fell off & got tangled with the packaging & torn.  This is not a good thing when you need to read the instructions and safety information.<br /><br />All in all I'd say this was a 2 thumbs up product but since dogs do not have thumbs it will get the 2 tails up award.

We've used the chewable tables in the past and sometimes these wouldn't be eaten, even though they were hidden in the food. The powder has wored much better as we can mix it in more thoroughly. As far as effectiveness, our dog seems to be more active and more able to use her back legs/hip for getting up and down. She seems more youthful, so this is definintely worth a try.

Eventually this will become hip displacia.  Our vet recommended we start her on a glucosamine supplement.  I tried giving her this supplement but she's not too crazy about it.  I mix it in her food but I can tell she doesn't really like it.  I don't care for the STRONG cinnamon smell so maybe that is off-putting to her.  I will continue to give it to her in the hopes that it will help her but I really wish the smell was different.

review/summary: Dog not happy, Mommy not happy
review/text: GreenDog Naturals Healthy Motion Powder sounded like a great idea.  I thought it would help my dog feel better, move better, she is 10 years old and I had high hopes.  Perhaps this product actually works, I can't tell, because whenever I put it in her food, she won't touch it.  I supppose if it came in another flavor I would have had better luck, but she just wouldn't try it.  If she won't eat it, I can hardly see if it works!<br /><br />Oh well.

review/summary: Dog-approved and seems to work
review/text: My dog is very picky about her food, treats, etc.  Other powdered medicines sprinkled on her food she generally refuses to eat.  However, this one is an exception.  Either she doesn't know it's there or doesn't mind it/the taste.<br /><br />This does seem to help her mobility as well, but I also supplement this with glucosomine treats and food containing some glucosomine, so I'm not sure how much of an impact it really has.  It definitely doesn't have any adverse effects on her mobility or diet, so based on her taking to the powder and its perceived effects, I'd recommend this to prospective buyers.

review/summary: Far less than advertised.
review/text: The packaging claims that the 150g jar of powder is a 30-60 day supply; however, for my 40-pound dog it only lasted 10 days. This is partly because the packaging instructs you to double the dose for the first 4-6 weeks; however, even if I had not been doubling the dose it would only have last 20 days -- and it's supposed to be used on dogs more than twice my dog's size. If you have a dog over 75 pounds and want to double the dose as recommended, you'll be through with the jar in five days!<br /><br />In the little time before the jar ran out I did not notice any difference in my dog's joint discomfort.<br /><br />On the plus side, I suppose, there's the fact that she really loved the taste.

review/summary: Great joint supplement - good price
review/text: our older dog has been on joint supplements for several years - and they work. When I saw this one, I figured why not give it a try.<br /><br />The supplement is in a powder form and it is easily mixable into our dehydrated raw food diet for the dogs.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- easy to mix into raw/dehydrated dog food (see below on cons)<br />- plenty of supplement for the price - 60 doses for smaller (below 25lb) dogs and 30 doses for larger.<br />- MADE IN THE USA - no worries about contaminated products from overseas!<br />- apparently tastes good to the dogs<br />- ingredients list is there to see and all the 'good' joint stuff is present.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- If you feed kibble, the powder could potentially cause issues depending on whether or not your dog is willing to lick it all up.<br /><br />Overall I like the product and the price point is good for the amount you receive.

review/text: One of the reasons I ordered this product is that its ingredients look to very good quality. I hoped that it would be tasty enough to entice our finicky German Shepherd/Belgian Malinois to eat with a little more gusto. However, it didn't pan out for us. I don't blame the product for this, in the least. I still think it is good quality and could be of benefit to dogs. I just have a very picky eater.

review/summary: Get the tablets
review/text: Our Pomeranian has become increasingly less mobile over the years, and I have been looking for something to help him get up-and-at-um. Within three weeks of using Healthy Motion, I could see a slight difference in our pup's willingness to move around and, when he does get up, he remains standing for longer than he has been lately. In other words, I think this product is actually working; which is great! I could not be more pleased to see our dog act a bit younger.<br /><br />The issue that I have with this product is not the formula, it is the powder form. The powder tends to sift down to the bottom of the food bowl and make a sticky paste. This paste seems to unfailingly attach itself to our dog's nose and then to anything in our home that our dog sniffs...which is everything. Beyond this, while our dog loved the flavor at first, after a few days he began to eat around the powder. This required some more inventive application measures to ensure ingestion.<br /><br />The formula works and I will buy it in the future. However, I will be buying the chewable tablets, as opposed to the powder, and have to recommend that anyone else do the same if your dog is still able to chew a tablet.

review/text: I got a jar of this and decided to try it out on my older female Malamute.  I can't judge it on how effective it is because you have to use 2 tablespoons of it a day as recommended for dogs over 60 lbs.  It's gross looking but she liked it okay.  Basically, it's not money well spent, unless you have a small dog.

review/summary: My chocolate lab sure likes it
review/text: I don't normally pay a lot of attention to canine supplements, however as my Chocolate Labrador Maggie, is hitting middle age, it is something that I am starting to pay more attention to. I would hope that using a supplement for joints now will help avoid any issues later.<br /><br />The Healthy Motion Powder is one of those that is easy to add to her food. She eats Orijen kibble with a very small amount of canned food added for excitement. The Green Dog Naturals powder is sprinkled on top of each meal (I feed her in the AM & PM) I was a little concerned that since her food is dry, and the supplement is a powder, that not being able to "hide" it in the food would be an issue. Not at all; she loves the flavor and eats it almost like it is a condiment.<br /><br />She has shown no signs of joint problems at her current age, so obviously it is difficult to say for sure that the product is beneficial to her at this time. There are however, a lot of glucosimine joint supplements on the market, so if you are considering one, I would certainly take a good look at this product.

review/summary: GREAT PRICE & HIGHLY EFFICACIOUS FOR OUR 13 YR. OLD SHI-POO
review/text: *****<br /><br />Tried it through the VINE and will be ordering more of this for sure.<br /><br />We have a 13 yr. old Shi-Poo [Shih Tzu / Poodle Mix] and he was slowing down just due to getting old but is an otherwise super-healthy and super-happy dog. We had tried another product from Costco last year when our other dog - a German Shepherd / ??? mix was 14 and really having a tough time with arthritis. [She went to be with the other dogs in the Sky this past summer]<br /><br />This product seems to work better than that product did; of course since our Shi-Poo is smaller than the other dog I mentioned this might not be a purely objective point of view...<br /><br />What IS objective is the price of this product; I don't think you will find a better price on this type of product - a GLUCOSAMINE and MSM mix - than what you see here on Amazon.<br /><br />Try it!

review/text: I've used another much more expensive powder that my dog wouldn't eat once on her food.  This stuff obviously smells and tastes good to her because she eats it.  It is a natural salmon flavor but doesn't stink.  My dog has hip dysplasia and her vet recommended she take stuff with glucoseamine in it, like this powder.  I like how it is made in the U.S.A.  Since she likes it I will keep buying it.  I haven't gone through the whole container, but she is 80 pounds and I use 2 tablespoons a day so I don't know how long it will last.

review/text: As the owner of an older dog with joint arthritis, I have tried a number of supplements to assist her.  She also has digestive issues, and I was a bit concerned about trying a new product.  However, I was very pleasantly satisfied with the results.  This powder is easy to mix into food, and my dog seems to find it quite palatable.  She eagerly licks the remaining powder out of the bottom of the bowl.  It also appears to be very effective in terms of giving my dog relief and increased mobility.  I'll be buying more in the future.

review/summary: Dog LIkes it
review/text: I have a senior shepherd who takes glucasomine.  Of late, she has been spitting out her pills no matter how well hidden.  She'll disassemble a pill pocket, lick off canned food, even extricate them from peanut butter and cream cheese.  I was gong to grind them into a powder but was afraid she would reject her food if she didn't like the flavor (or noticed what I wasa doing).  So I figured I would give this product a try.<br /><br />The canister contains a green powder that smells like  pumpkin pie spice. One tablespoon contains 500 mg of glucasomine and 250 mg MSM.  It also contains spirulina, green lipped mussel extract, an ocean sourced omega blend and a joint comfort blend which includes ginger, tumeric, bromelain, stinging nettles and meadowsweet.  Ina ctive ingredients incude cinnamon, cloves, natural sweet salmon flavoring, organic flax, siica and sprouted barley malt.  Dosage ranges from 1 teaspoon for dogs under ten pouns to 2 tablespoons for dogs over 75 pounds.  The product should be refrigerated after opening and it is suggested that the recommended dosage be doubled the first four to six weeks.<br /><br />So far my german sherpherd seems to like it and getting it down is the biggest part of the battle.  I like the committment to using organic ingredients where possible and also the usage of recycled materials for the container. It is too early to tell whether this product is equal to or superior to the previous supplement.  However it smells good and is easy to use.  It is a bit pricey per serving, espeically if your dog is large and I wish they included a little scoop.<br /><br />I think that natural supplements are preferrable to pharmaceuticals.  I take glucasomine myself and have benefitted. My dog, like most older GSDS, has arthritis and the glucasomine seems to keep her mobile and active. This product gets plusses for palatability,ingredients and ease of use.  I will be buying it again.

review/text: I have a ten-ish (I think he was older then what the adoption place said he was) Chihuahua who I like to joke sleeps twenty-three hours a day, getting up to eat and go for bi-daily walks which he rarely has problems trotting along for except for when the temperature drops below freezing.  I also have a five year old poodle mix that is fairly active.  As directed, I sprinkled the recommended dosage (about a teaspoon each) on their dinners and both ate it up with no hesitation.  The powder has a nice cinnamon type smell to it.  Almost instantly I noticed both dogs have a bit more energy than usual post dinner, roaming around and engaging me in a game of tug before their nightly naps.  In all, I used up one can in about a month and a half using it daily at dinner for both my dogs.

review/summary: NO CRAP fillers or junk ingredients AND Made in USA
review/text: One jar is a 30-60 day supply for your dog. 60 days if your dog is 25lbs or less. The instructions give weight ranges from dogs under 10lbs to over 75lbs. It says for maximum benefit to double usage the first 4-6 weeks. For freshness after opening, keep in the refrigerator. No fillers, sugar, artificial colors, preservatives, sodium, wheat, corn or soy.<br /><br />This powder comes in a plastic jar that is halfway full -- not sure if it settled during shipping but it's always a disappointment to open something (like potato chip bags) and find it's not quite full. Despite my initial impression, it seems that this is a really good product. It  is made by the same company that makes the vitamins that I take myself.<br /><br />My dog didn't seem to interested in it -- he sniffed it and walked away and then came back later and ate his food. It says it's salmon flavor but it smells a little chocolate-y to me.<br /><br />I've used other treat type supplements and my dog gets really gassy. I'm hoping this is more gentle on his stomach. I'll update after we've used this product for a while.

review/summary: Green Glucoasamine Product To Support Dog's Joints
review/text: My family has an eight year old Yorkie who has experienced significant joint problems in both his shoulders and hips.  He is used to eating glucosamine treats to help alleviate these issues but these treats have to be broken in to several pieces for him because of his small size (6 pounds).  This "motion" powder can be sprinkled on the dog's food and a teaspoonful is the serving size for small dogs (under ten pounds).  A disadvantage to me of this product is it has to be refrigerated after opening and our dog's eating area is a long way from the kitchen.  Our dog did readily eat the stuff when mixed with his regular food but I think he still prefers the glucosamine he has been receiving in the forms of treats for the last few years.

review/summary: Pregestimil Hypoallergenic Formula
review/text: This was an awesome convenient way to purchase our infant's special formula. (He's had proper weight gain and a more pleasant disposition after switching to this.)<br /><br />The only problem is that since Amazon is no longer carrying it or it's temporarily out of stock, we weren't able to rely on them for this. We have since switched to the autoship program directly from the manufacturer and it's the same price. I thought I was saving money buying it at Amazon but we weren't because of tax/shipping. However, if I buy books I do check to see if the formula is in stock because it is so hard to find and it's nice to have extra cans on hand in case I miscalculated the autoship dates.... If Amazon had it consistently, I'd buy a case of it and some books every month in one shipment. Too bad for them. We'll just get our books locally until I need something specific again.

review/summary: You will never order delivery pizza again!
review/text: Excellent product. Makes equally good thin or pan pizza crust. Also good for breadsticks. Betty's Tips on the back of the package will tell you how to make a basic pizza for best results. I put a little garlic basil olive oil on the crust before the sauce. I use generic spaghetti sauce already seasoned with italian herbs and spice.(Cheaper and less salty than so called "pizza sauce") Buy shredded mozzarella or 5 italian cheese blend.(Save even more money and buy the cheese on sale during a buy one get one free promo.) And viola! Pizza in less than a hour and less than five bucks. Compare that to 15-20 dollars for a specialty 5 cheese pizza from those other guys and you have money for your piggy bank. I love this product. I have made 3 pizzas so far...no soggy crust. So that must be a pilot error and not Betty Crocker's fault.(lol)

review/summary: Simple to prepare and better than anything I could make myself.
review/text: These crusts are so easy and convenient, I wouldn't bother making my own from scratch again. It takes some time to get used to the best way to prepare and how long they should go in your oven, but once you play around with it a bit then you will have an excellent pizza crust. I recommend spraying the base of the pizza pan with olive oil Pam, as well as the crust after you have put on all the toppings. If the pizza is coming out soggy, you're overdoing the toppings.

review/summary: My kids love making their own pizzas!
review/text: I found that a great family dinner can be made with these. I get one pouch for each of my kids. They get to mix the water in and stir it up themselves and then roll it out to a crust of whatever shape they want. Then they add whatever toppings they want and cook it themsleves (with our supervision). We use shredded cheese from the grocery store and make our own sauce from vegetables we grow in our own garden. My daughter loves bacon crumbles and mozzarella cheese on a heart shaped crust, my son likes chicken and cheddar and a dinosaur shape. You can use nearly anything. My wife and I try things like spinach, hot peppers, ham, onions, ground beef, whatever is left over from previous meals. Once they are done, we have taste tests to see whose pizza is the best. My kids LOVE making their own pizzas, and we love getting them involved, and it makes a great family meal night followed by board or card games.<br /><br />Even better, we can feed the whole family our own custom pizzas for less than ten dollars. You can't walk into a pizza place for less than $25 with two kids and then you argue over which toppings. Two thumbs up for family fun night!<br /><br />Also, I am using this crust mix to make strombolis.

review/summary: Great and not soggy if done correctly
review/text: I mixed it as per instructions, then I put 1 tablespoon on the dough and rolled it around in the bowl. I then covered it with a towel and put in the oven for 5 minutes at 150 degrees. I sprayer pan Olive oil on my 18" pizza pan, then spread the crust out to about 12-13". I then preheated the oven to 425 degrees and precooked the crust for about 8-10 minutes. I then let the crust cool a little. I then put 1 cup of pizza sauce with oregano and Organic garlic sea salt. I put 1 small onion finely chopped with 1/2 of a red pepper finely chopped, then topped with 6 ounces of fancy Italian blend cheese. I cooked the pizza on the lowest rack at 425 degrees until the entire pizza was slightly browned. DELICOIUS. The crust was slightly browned and not soggy at all, without being too crunchy. Aslo check your oven with a real oven thermometer, mine was 30 degrees lower then the setting. I always wondered why the center wouldn't get slightly browned likt the edges. WOW perfect and delicious.

review/summary: simple, delicious and great value!
review/text: My husband and I love to make pizza and we used to either get the frozen Pillsbury dough (which always tastes like their biscuits to me and not really like pizza) or a Boboli crust. Both of those options were pricier than this and this tastes far better. You can find this dough in the baking aisle of the supermarket (with the muffin mixes usually). The prep is extremely simple and the crust is delicious, better even than the ready made dough that you can purchase. The best part is that it doesn't go bad so you can just leave one in the closet and always have it for when the pizza mood strikes. Even since we found this crust mix we have recommended it to just about everyone we know and they have loved it as well. It is just a quality product that allows you to make fresh dough for cheaper and faster than you could do it yourself from scratch.

review/summary: not the real thing but a good substitute
review/text: I resorted to buying a case of this product from Amazon when none of my local stores would stock it (I live in a small town called "Los Angeles"). Since I have to do kosher cooking now and then, its designation as UD was a convenience. Even though it contains yeast, it has the characteristics of a baking powder dough, so it never attains the proper chewiness or crispness. Instead, it sucks up oil and turns out flaky and salty; think of a big, flat biscuit. It can be improved three ways: 1) let it rise twice (once after mixing, again after pressing into the pan); 2) bake it empty for five minutes, then pull it out of the oven and let it cool before adding topping; and 3) slide it off the pan and finish it on the bare oven rack. The reason I rated this product four stars is its convenience and ease of clean-up. I make one a week for the kids and this way can control the amount of oil, salt, and gunk that comes on professional pizzas. Tip: try kneading a third of a cup of cooked, chopped spinach into the dough and add a little extra flour to absorb the inevitable spinach water.

review/summary: Great for Camping!
review/text: This product is perfect for camping trips! I discovered these while on a camping/roadtrip to Yellowstone.  We traditionally have family pizza night on Sat. and the kids miss it when we travel and camp.  This quick pizza dough is the answer.  Just add water and you're ready to go! We use the Coleman folding oven and our camp stove to cook them.  The dough is very versatile.  We use one package per person and we each add our own favorite toppings.  It's awesome!! Too bad I can't buy them in my own grocery store. I like them so much I order them from Amazon by the case! I use small pizza pans when I cook them, but if you make the crust thick enough you probably wouldn't need a pan. I also have the pizza pan that you can use over a fire, but I haven't tried it with this dough yet.  Anyone else? I made up Pizza making baskets for Christmas presents using this dough and it was a big hit!

My 5 year old helps us make the pizza all the time.  It's perfect for the 9" round pan.  You put sauce on and your favorite topping and into the oven it goes.  I highly recommend for everyone to try.  Especially if you have kids, this can get them involved.

review/summary: Better than we expected.
review/text: Seriously, I am not one of those people who cook something and think that it's the best ever. Here is my honest review. I wasn't expecting it to be great. Just passible, after reading some of the less favorable reviews. I made the crust mix as instructed, but I did add 1 1/2 tbl spoons of Extra Virgin olive oil. I do not know how significant of a difference it made, but our pizza came out really good! I was very surprised. I used Pastorelli's pizza sauce along with it (found it at Target) and it made a great pizza. So try it for yourself. I'm not saying it's better than from scratch, but it is a great substitute if you want a quicker and easier way. Enjoy.

review/summary: Fresh pizza in 30 minutes!
review/text: While I do like chain store pizzas, it's fun and easy to make your own!<br /><br />This makes it ultra simple.  I've tried making my own crust from scratch and it's just a mess and takes too long.  This gives great results with its' "just add water" (and maybe a teaspoon of olive oil).<br /><br />Have kids?  Even better, put them to 'work' making the pizza.<br /><br />I use Hunts canned spaghetti sauce instead of regular 'pizza sauce' and I freeze the leftovers in pre-portioned used margerine containers as it really only takes a few tablespoons to make a pizza (any leftover sauce is now called dippy sauce :) .  Definitely get a big block of fresh mozzarela (about a pound) for each pizza, less if you like to add more toppings.  Get a grater from walmart or similar store.  They rust, but they are only a dollar or two.  Do your toppings fresh as NOTHING beats fresh.<br /><br />Now, my family rarely buys chain (or local) store pizza.  We find that it's much more fun (and much, much cheaper) to make it ourselves and we all rate our 'homemade' pizzas better or equal to those chain stores.<br /><br />Note:  I have not bought from amazon and buy instead at a local store as I just don't have space to store a case.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like pizza crust should
review/text: This stuff was a disappointment to me after reading all the glowing reviews here. The texture was OK; I didn't have any problems with getting the crust to brown, or it being soggy in the middle. The problem was the taste, which I found somewhat reminiscent of bisquick. This stuff just doesn't taste like pizzeria pizza crust, not even close. Looking at the ingredient list I guess it should come as no surprise, since it contains egg, soy, and milk!<br /><br />My suggestion if you want a quick and easy homemade pizza crust without having to make the dough a day in advance, get some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004136MDG">Fleischmann's Pizza Yeast</a> and follow the recipe on the packet (Amazon's price is ridiculously high, check your local supermarket instead). It's almost as fast to make as the Betty Crocker mix (a few minutes of kneading is required), but the resulting crust is much better. I made one of each on the same night, and the Fleischmann's crust was the unanimous winner.

review/summary: Great find for the Big Green Egg
review/text: My first attempt at pizza on the Big Green Egg was a disaster...now I know that most of the problem was the dough...although I will take part of the blame.  I had been told that the Betty Crocker mix was really good, but I couldn't find it at my grocery, so I bought another brand, (name not metioned).  I found myself dealing with a sticky, hard to work with dough that was difficult...to say the least...to work with.  Determined to do better, I ordered the Betty Crocker Pizza Mix. My packets will be good for a year so I'm happy about that unknown fact.  The dough was easy to work with...a little extra flour to keep my fingers from sticking while shaping it on the pizza peel, tasty, with a crispy edge and very slightly chewy interior.  I cooked it at about 600 degrees, (bottom wide open and daisy wheel on top an wide open for those using the BGE).  Next time I will try to make it as thin as possible, as it rose during the baking process.  Use the Betty Crocker mix and tell 'em it's homemade!

Recently she has been able to jump up on our bed at night where she sleeps at our feet, she had been begging until we picked her up and put her on the bed, and I think this is largely due to IAMS Proactive Health Adult Chunks.

review/summary: Unhealthy... Look at the Ingredients
review/text: I fed my dog Iams Proactive Health for five years before realizing that it is a very unhealthy, low-quality, and species-innappropriate dog food.<br /><br />The package states "No fillers."  However, take a look at the first five ingredients...chicken, corn meal, ground whole grain sorghum, chicken byproduct meal, dried beet pulp.  The last four of the first five ingredients are fillers!  Also, the first ingredient, chicken, probably occupies a lower position on the list because, after cooking, most of the moisture is lost and chicken is about 80% moisture. [1][2]<br /><br />As to being species-inappropriate, have you ever heard of a wolf attacking a corn stalk?<br /><br />After I started researching dog food, I switched my dog to Taste of the Wild, a grain-free kibble, and Bravo Balance, raw dog food.  When my dog was eating Iams, she often left food in her bowl for several hours.  Now she eats her food as soon as I give it to her.  Also, her coat is softer and she doesn't get constipated anymore (she did every now and then eating Iams).<br /><br />Yes, Iams is "vet-recommended" and my vet approved of it.  However, I have reason to believe that many vets have been improperly and undereducated in nutrition, and the education that they do receive is biased.  Hill's Pet Nutrition Inc., which makes "Hill's Science Diet" with similar ingredients to Iams, has created and distributes a nutrition curriculum to vet schools around the world.  They also administer the Hill's vet school graduate feeding program, which provides pet food to students at no charge that they can resell for a profit.  In addition to providing course materials to veterinary students, Hills's, Iams, Purina, and other well-known manufacturers also offer additional perks for students. [3][4]<br /><br />Please, do not believe pet food companies' claims without looking at the ingredients for yourself!  It's a pay now or pay later situation.  If you feed your dog a high-quality, wholesome food now you will have to pay less in vet bills later.

review/text: Marshmallow fluff is delicious if you know how to use it, and the good news is, it's pretty easy!  I used mine this way:  I made brownies, let them cool completely, then topped them with a layer of fluff.  In order to spread the fluff, you will microwave it in small doses for about 10 seconds or so for each 'batch'.  Once the fluff is melty, then spread on top of the brownies.  Let the brownies cool completely.  You can serve them like this, but what I like to do is to then top the brownies with a layer of icing (on top of the marshmallow fluff!)  They are always a hit!

review/summary: Totally Disappointing!
review/text: My husband and I LOVE maple candy like this (well usually) so I was really excited when I found it on Amazon. Though I would give us a little treat every couple months so I signed up for the 2 month auto shipment. The first shipment came really quickly but we were both totally disappointed! Maple candy usually melts in your mouth. Occasionally you'll come across a piece that is a little hard. This whole box was hard! You had to suck on it forever to get is soft enough to eat. Canceled the auto the next day.

review/summary: Dry, broken pieces
review/text: I was hoping this would be a nice gift for my older children who could not go on vacation with us this year. We purchase maple sugar candy when we are in the mountains. I sent them to both and when they received them they were dry, and broken up.  The box does not have plastic wrap to keep it fresh.  I thought it was a mistake with my first daughter but when we stopped by my second daughters apartment on the way home I noticed that hers was broken up too.  She said that it was also very hard and dry.  I would definitely purchase again IF they fixed their packaging.

review/text: The candies came in were out of their individual positions and crashed together, even the big pieces in the centre - leaving crumbs and small damages.  I have to open the package and re-arrange the candies into its individual positions.

review/summary: Delicious Maple Candy
review/text: We purchased this as a gift for a dear friend who has a particular fondness for Maple Sugar Candy. She was thrilled and apparently the candy was so good it didn't last long after we gifted it to her. I'd say that is a pretty good indication that the candy is a winner. Nicely packaged as well.

review/text: Other reviewers were right. The candy is very hard and, due to Amazon's poor packing, the candy was dumped out of its compartments and all slid to the end of the box, many broken into pieces. Very unsatisfied. Buy it elsewhere.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I do have to admit that this is only the second brand I've ever bought maple candy from, I'm a newcomer. But I thought these were delicious! As other reviewers noted the box wasn't sealed, but that didn't seem to affect the quality at all. The candies are ridiculously creamy inside, and while I did start to feel some graininess I think it was just because I was becoming more accustomed to the texture after eating like 5 in a row. They're a GREAT value- even if they were hard, I'd still buy them because they're 75% cheaper value-wise than the little boxes I can get at the grocery store, and since I have prime they ship free and fast. Definitely buying these again when I finish my box, and recommending them to everyone I know!

review/text: I concur with reviewers who thought the product arrived hard and stale. The box arrived with the candies shifted out of place, in a jumble, chipped and dinged. Not suitable as a gift because of the damage and the poor quality. Couldn't use the item as a gift which is why I bought it.

review/summary: A Review of Two
review/text: This will be a combined review comparing two brands of maple candy I purchased on Amazon. I first bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248EA8Y">Butternut Mountain Farm Pure Maple Sugar Candy, 9-Ounce Box</a>.  It was one of the lowest price ones I could find, so I figured I'd try it first. The box was not totally sealed in plastic. The centers were a bit grainy - not creamy as I'd prefer. I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />Next I bought Mansfield Maple- 1 LB (16oz) Pure Vermont Maple Sugar Candy (48 Candies) [cannot add product link for some reason.] Now this stuff was wonderful! The box was not totally sealed in plastic, either, so I just put all of them in a sealed plastic container upon arrival. The outside was solid and the centers were creamy despite the packaging. The company bills them as "Crystal Coated with Pure Maple to "lock in" the freshness... Made Fresh to Order." That may be why they are perfect. I will keep buying this brand!

review/summary: Poorly packaged/packed product arrived unusable as a gift
review/text: I think both the seller and amazon share the blame for this item purchased as a gift arriving totally unpresentable as a gift, and maybe inedible. You see, this item isn't really packaged for shipping or for freshness. The candies arrived having fallen out of their little compartments and jumbled in a heap to one end of the now bulging box. The candies are banged up and there's maple sugar dust all over the outside of the box. Packed this way, with no seal, I'm guessing the candies are hard as rocks. Very disappointed in this seller.<br /><br />Now for amazon: the little plastic air pouches used in packing were completely deflated. This item was packed with an engagement calendar in a box that probably could have held three times as much merchandise. So the contents were obviously banged around a lot. I really don't have time to pack this up and run 9 miles to a post office to return it.

review/text: Lawry's Brown Gravy in the packet is really, really good.  It doesn't have that vitamin or fake aftertaste that most packet gravies have.  I sometimes will add drippings from the roast (if I'm making a roast) to this gravy, although it doesn't need doctoring up.  This gravy is so good, I ship it from FL. to my mother in PA., as she cannot find in her local supermarkets.  I just shipped her a case directly from this website.  I chose regular shipping, and amazingly she received it the very next day!  That is what I call outstanding service.

review/summary: A great Seasoning
review/text: I picked up this seasoning about a year ago on a whim.  Everytime I use this product I receive compliments on the great meal.  I have used it with pork, chicken and fish.  It is really fantastic on fish and plain old fashion pork chops, Oh I forgot pot roast in a crock pot is to melt in your mouth with real flavor.  I just wish the store I purchased it would still carry this product.  I have been looking all over for it and they always just carry the basic Creole line.  I hope Tony Chachere's pushes for this seasoning to be in more supermarkets.
