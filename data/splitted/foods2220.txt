review/summary: Love it
review/text: I had never heard of this brand of shampoo.  But being one who loves to try new things I snatched it up with a quickness.<br /><br />And I'm hooked.<br /><br />I love the smell, it's pretty without being overpowering.  I require less of this shampoo to get a good lather in my hair then my normal Pantene, and the bottle is a nice shape.  I have noticed that my hair feels cleaner for longer through the day and feels lighter.  Less residue perhaps.<br /><br />I did not get the conditioner to try with it so I have just been using a bottle of moisture rich herbal essences that I had laying around.  I would love to try the conditioner to go with it.  If it is half as great as this shampoo then I would be sold on the product for sure.<br /><br />The negative is that this is not available for sale at any store anywhere near me... but the price as listed on amazon is not outrageous so I may just end up ordering from here.<br /><br />This is a product that I will continue to use and am happy as can be that I have tried.

review/summary: Amazingly Effective
review/text: My new favorite shampoo. After using both the shampoo and conditioner for a couple of weeks, my hair has more body and my kind of dry scalp is not flaking at all. As someone else with grey hair mentioned, I noticed right away that my hair feels more like the hair of my youth when it was naturally blond. If you have flakes, or dry feeling hair, I recommend you give Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty products a try.

review/text: I have been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR898">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, and I am very happy with it, so I bought this for my husband.  Since his hair has gotten thin as he has gotten older, he has developed a dry scalp problem.  He is very pleased with the results of this shampoo.  This shampoo has a pleasant scent that is not overpowering, and it is reasonably priced.

review/summary: Helps the scalp, no difference in hair.
review/text: I have a dry scalp so I thought I needed too try this. The shampoo is the consistency of a normal conditioner, lightly scented, lathers easily and rinses out completely. It took a couple of applications before I noticed a difference in my scalp; it did seem to aid in helping retain its natural oils some. I shall continue too use it and see. I notice no difference in my hair what so ever. Not: I did not get the conditioner so do not know how much of a difference it would make.

review/summary: Bought on accident, but still like.
review/text: I have oily hair and wanted the color treated one, which I have bought and like a lot.  I don't like to wash my hair everyday and I color it once a month so it gets oily on the tops and feels like straw on the bottom. I liked this conditioner it really made my hair soft, but not stat-icy. It smells really good too. All these products do. I didn't notice that this particular product helped my scalp because I have been using all the products and overall the oiliness has gone down. I can go at least 4 days now without washing!

review/summary: Scalp, Hair & Smell -- Awesome Product!
review/text: First: I love the smell of this shampoo but I can't identify it. Perhaps it's a blend of strawberries, flower essences and a drop of citrus? But whatever it is, to me it smells heavenly!<br /><br />Second: My scalp feels cleaner than it's felt in ages. I usually use the cheapest shampoo available (costs 79 cents on sale).<br /><br />Third: My hair has just the right weight (it's "moisturized") and is laying flat and straight. A nice change from the more poufy, blow-dry look I've been getting lately.<br /><br />This product is made by Unilever, but I notice it has many of the same ingredients as a well-known anti-dandruff shampoo which has been around since 1950. A couple of those ingredients are Zinc Pyrithione and Sodium Laureth Sulfate. This also has Cocamidopropyl Betaine and a trademarked formula that nourishes the scalp (and thus the hair) called "Nutrium 10." Nutrium 10 is a proprietary formula of "Ten Vitamins & Nutrients."<br /><br />Awesome product!

review/summary: Does a good job
review/text: I've always thought that shampoo is pretty much all the same, for the most part, and this "Clear Scalp & Hair Therapy" product doesn't do much to change my opinion. However, with that said, this is good shampoo that I would recommend. It's got a fresh and subtle fruity smell (maybe strawberry?) that is not overwhelming but does give off a nice odor. Like all shampoo, you could probably use this as body wash in the shower as well. The draw of this product seems to be its ability to nourish the scalp. It's hard for me to know if the skin on my scalp is enhanced when I use this shampoo, especially since the weather is warm and dry flakes from your scalp aren't as prevalent during the spring and summer. Nonetheless, I have no reason to believe that this stuff doesn't help your scalp. As for the how this shampoo cleans when I use it, my hair feels silky, full and looks good after a shower. The bottle has a slender, stylish design and light pink color, and the top pops up just slightly, which makes it spill-proof and very easy to open and close. The shampoo itself has a silky, creamy feel and isn't overly goopy or thick.

review/summary: for senior grey hair it is a winner
review/text: i am a senior with mostly grey hair, which means on the dry side, the last thing i want at this stage is a shampoo which strips oil out of my hair.  this does not do that.  i only need to shampoo once and my hair comes out fine, it is a creamy lilac color and gives you a real dense foam with even a small amount. i have hard water so it rinsed right out.  i have fine but thick hair so i might try the volumizing version of this product next. this moisturizing scalp version probably would not be good for someone with oily scalp.

review/text: I don't have a huge problem with a dry scalp, but my hair itself is very dry so I thought I would try this out. It didn't really do anything for me. It works fine for normal cleaning, but because I have such thick, dry, frizzy hair, I didn't see any great improvements and would not use this over my regular hair care products (Aussie). I wasn't too fond of the scent either, but it wasn't very strong to me so it was bearable.

review/summary: Good solution for dry hair - easy to open...too easy!
review/text: My spouse has dry hair so this was his first bottle to try out and he absolutely loves this shampoo! However - and this is a big one for me - the fragrance is VERY strong. I find it overpowering. My spouse LOVES IT and since he is the one using this particular dry hair formula, it's okay except when he first gets out the shower. Of course, that is personal preference but if you are sensitive to fragrances, keep this in mind before purchasing the product.<br /><br />There was one problem with these shampoo/conditioners - about half arrived with the top open in a big yucky mess. Fortunately, Amazon had wrapped them inside the box which contained the shampoo in the plastic but otherwise, it would have been a giant mess with about 1/4 of the entire bottle squeezed out. The same issue that made them pop open in shipping does make them convenient for use in the shower.<br /><br />Last but not least, despite the additional of vitamins/supplements to enhance the product, I've been moving aware of many of the other harsh ingredients/chemicals contained in this/other shampoo's and conditioners. I did NOT deduct a point for it because once again, that is a lifestyle related choice.<br /><br />Bottom Line - a good product for dry but those with sensitivities to fragrance will want to think twice.

review/summary: Quality shampoo.
review/text: We chose to try out the Clear Scalp & Hair shampoo to see if it's all it claims to be. Both my wife and I have used it, and I would have to say it's lived up to expectations. The shampoo is pretty thick, so after you've scrubbed it into your hair some, I would recommend getting a little more water in your hair and scrubbing some more to get a good lather going. It's got a pleasant smell which isn't overly "flowery" so if you're a man you shouldn't be scared to use it. My wife has colored hair and says that it's been a little harsher on her color than other shampoos she has used (she usually uses Pantene). Other than that, we both think it's a decent shampoo that is worth trying out to see if it's right for you.

review/summary: Pair it with Clear condition and your hair is good to go
review/text: I am using this shampoo with Clair Strong Lengths conditioner.  It is mild shampoo and only a dash is needed for your hair, no matter what the hair length.  It has many nourishing oils in it and makes hair feel clean and silky.  In addition to oils, this shampoo also has multiple bio-nutrients; combination of minerals and vitamins will make your hair stronger and shiny.<br /><br />Shampoo does not have strong fragrance; it is just right.  It also keeps frizz out of the way, very helpful feature for humid climate customers.  Sturdy base of the product makes it stable to use and lay out in the shower.  You will never make a mistake which bottle is shampoo and which one is conditioner.  Shampoo label is upside down while conditioner can be read normally.  Shampoo has light see true color, while conditioner has thick white color - another distinction if you are not paying attention to the lables and you just start queezing the product out of the bottle.<br /><br />I personally enjoy the product very much and recommend it to others.  It is a kind of product that can be used by the entire family.

review/text: I love this stuff. I love limes- I find it the flavor a bit more complex than orange or lemon- and they make a wonderful marmalade. This marmalade isn't bitter like orange marmalade is, and isn't as tart/sweet as a lemon curd would be. A great subtle flavor, and much more grown-up flavor than a berry jam. A wonderful indulgence on a Sunday morning, it practically begs for crumpets and champagne.

review/text: I bought my Hellmann's mayonnaise at the local grocery (Indiana), expiry date April 2012.  It was also bad when opened - it tasted super-vinegary and just "off," and I have been using Hellmann's for many years.  I don't know if they have changed the formula or what, but I threw out a much-anticipated BLT sandwich because I had put Hellmann's on it.  If they have changed the recipe, they REALLY need to go back to the old one.  I won't ruin any more family recipes by using Hellmann's if they don't.

review/text: I grew up in Germany where gooseberries are plentiful, can't ever find them in California. I figured this home made jam would be similar to the one I remembered as a child, but it turned out to be a big disappointment. There in not enough fruit in this jam, and too much sugar. It tastes sickeningly sweet without acidity balancing out the sweetness - because of the lack of fruit. Too bad, I had really been looking forward to eating this jam.... and so the search continues.

review/summary: Tasty oil cured ripe olives
review/text: I took a chance and ordered these since my grocery store usually doesn't have the oil cured ripe olives.  I was a little worried that they would be overly salty because of another review of Roland olives that I read.  I discovered that they are no more nor less salty than any other oil cured ripe olives I have eaten (these kind of olives also vary a bit from olive to olive).  The Roland olives taste just as good, but now I don't have to be constantly frustrated because my grocery store doesn't carry the olive I want.  If you are used to those insipid canned black olives, your mouth will be shocked by both the rich olive flavor and, probably, the saltiness.  You should probably sample an oil cured ripe olive before you buy to make sure that traditional oil cured ripe olives are to your taste.

review/summary: excellent product
review/text: I had been buying oil cured olives from a local International grocery but the bottles are small and last only about two weeks. I really felt it was paying too much for too little product. So I hopped online and took a chance on these. Glad I did. The flavor is exactly the same and I get so much more for my money. Once they arrived I placed the contents into glass containers in my refrigerator and will enjoy these for some time to come. The listing does not say it but these are from Morocco, i.e. the real deal. I do not find them too salty as some others have stated.<br /><br />I struggled between 4 and 5 stars because of one quibble. The olives I purchased at the store were plumper and meatier. These are smaller. There has no detrimental effect on the taste but it just means more spitting out of pits. For the price however I'm quite tolerant of this. I will be buying these again once I run out.

review/summary: As good as you will find anywhere
review/text: The Roland oil cured olives are quite good. They are as good as any oil cured olives that I have made. It is actually pretty easy if you live in a place where olives grow. The term 'oil cured olives' is a bit of a misnomer. This type of olive is actually salt cured not oil cured. First very ripe black olives are picked from the tree, washed and towel dried. They are then packed in a crock in thin layers with kosher salt between each layer. After a few weeks the salt draws all the water out of the olives leaving then looking like small prunes. The next step is to wash the olives very thoroughly to remove most of the salt. Then they are dried with a towel to remove any water. Next place the olives in a bowl and mix with enough good olive oil to coat the olives. They are now ready to eat. They can be kept in the refigerator for many month. So as you can see oil cured olives are actually salt cured. The olive oil is absolutely not a curing agent. It is added to make the olives more palatable. This may explain why, so called 'oil cured olives' are a bit salty for some tastes. As many reviewers have mentinoned the Roland olives can be rinsed, dried with a towel then re-oiled with olive oil. This will produce an olive with much less salt. I frankly think that the Roland oilves aren't too salty and they are a good value when compared to grocery store oil cured olives.

review/summary: DELECTABLE
review/text: I had never tried oil cured olives before, and was warned by a 'foodie' friend to expect a lot of salt.  I wasn't surprised.  They were EXTREMELY salty.  What DID surprise me (pleasantly) was the succulent texture and rich olive flavour. I like to use chopped olives in hummus, and just left out the salt in the recipe.  If you really need to watch the salt, cover the olives in water, and "nuke" them for five minutes on high. covered.  Let them sit until cool enough to handle, then drain and rinse thoroughly.  Refrigerate over night and repeat the process with fresh water.  By then, you've gotten rid of almost half the salt, while retaining texture and flavour.<br /><br />Roland products are great.  Just expect the unexpected.

review/summary: Not from Italy
review/text: We just returned from Italy, Greece and Turkey having fallen in love with the olives in all those places, especially Turkey.  These olives from Roland are labeled from Morocco, not from Italy.  Nevertheless, they are delicious-not too salty nor too oily.  I think we will be ordering these frequently.

review/summary: Very Salty!
review/text: Regretfully I found these olives very, very salty, almost to the point of not being edible (and I bought five pounds!).  I anticipated receiving them so much, as I can't find oil cured olives in my area.  I tried taking a container of them and rinsing them off.  That helped a little.  I rinsed again, and that may have helped a little more.  Right now I'm experimenting by soaking a container of them in fresh water.  The salt overwhelms any other feature I might comment on.  They are small, but I don't mind the size.  The texture is a tad softer than other oil cured olives I've had, but the information says they get harder after opening, if not refrigerated.

review/summary: Good But Very Salty
review/text: Not having had a lot of experience with oil cured olives I did not know what to expect.  My impressions is that these olives are a good value, but I found them too salty for my taste.  I actually ended up soaking them in fresh water (changed often) for several hours to remove some of the salt.  While this helped, I still found them leaving me feeling like I had just consumed a weeks worth of salt.  The olives themselves were usually firm, not hard and in a few cases somewhat soft.  If these where peaches I would describe them as free-stone, meaning the pit is easily removed from flesh.

review/summary: Absolutely wonderful!
review/text: These olives are superb! Our family loves olives. We have tried many grocery and specialty store brands, but these are the best.<br />Do not expect them to taste like regular canned grocery store olives.  The oil they are cured in lends a very aromatic, almost fruity/floraly bouquet.  You may also find they taste a bit more salty than your typical olives. However, if you are a true olive lover, all of these elements will just be "positives" for you!  The price is great for the amount of olives you get. We will keep them coming.

review/summary: A Legend Among The Junk Food Realm
review/text: Have you ever just approached a vending machine and realized that everything inside of it isn't worthy of your hard earned dollar? Sunflower seeds? Please. Cheese Doodles?! Get a life.<br /><br />THEN!......there were Oreo Cakesters. Not only will you buy them every single time you are within 50 feet of such a vending machine, you will become irritated and Hulk-like when certain machines do not carry them. In rare cases, people have been known to resort to cannibalism in order to fuel their Cakester hunger.<br /><br />I'm sure you'd like to know details about the Cakester's composition, its preferred habitat, and its breeding habits, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned.<br /><br />To put it simply, I have never met a real life person that does not enjoy Oreo Cakesters. Do not be fooled by the posers posting reviews about this lovely product. They are spies sent by Keebler to take down the competition. I wouldn't trust those elves. Would YOU?....<br /><br />Now, you may be wondering about the texture of this bite sized dyno-mite snack. Well, I assure you they are made from only the finest ingredients from only the most elegant factories across the planet. If you treat your Cakesters with love and respect, and keep them in proper temperatures, I promise you will be pleased with the outcome.<br /><br />Honestly, Oreo Cakesters transform my mouth into a wonderful world where everything is safe and delicious. The people of this world don't commit crimes or act unjustly. They only care about making your taste buds the happiest they can be. Let Oreo Cakesters into your mouth and into your heart. You owe it to yourself to at least give them a chance. Disappointment is not an option.

review/text: I am not sure why I had such a craving for hostess products a month ago, but I did.  So my wife returns from the grocery store with Oreo Cakesters and claims she could not find any hostess items (my guess is she had a coupon).  So anyways I tried one and it was not bad.  It was like a soft extra creamy oreo.  Since I have always liked the white cream of the oreo best I was happy with the cakester.  To me it is not as good as a hostess cupcake but it comes close.  My wife really likes them as she has bought several boxes over the last few weeks and packs them as a mid day snack at work.

review/summary: Not the best choice in snack cakes
review/text: I found these snack cakes to be extremely dense and unfilling. They also fall apart pretty easily. The moist, dense, unflavorful chocolate cake also sticks to everything including your fingers, so beware. Not even my kids liked these, and well, they like just about everything including brussels sprouts.<br /><br />What makes Oreo so great is the crunchy cookie and sweet white icing, but neither of those qualities have been replicated very well in this cake. If you truly want a snack cake stick to Hostess for the best quality, or Little Debbie for the best value.<br /><br />I hope Oreo can revise this snack, because Oreos are a great, timeless product that sell themselves. I don't think many people will be repeat buyers of this particular product, however.

review/text: These were on sale for $1 for an entire box of 10 cakes at Vons, 25% of the regular price, so I couldn't help but buy 4 boxes. I was addicted to these things while they lasted, but after about 2 weeks, I just finished the last package. Definitely delicious but crumbly and I was always left wanting more. The cream in the middle is soo good. As a kid I always thought it would be awesome to eat oreo cream like they do in the movie "Honey I shrunk the kids" and FINALLY my dream came true! Honestly, I will probably never buy these again, and I wouldn't pay full price for them because I am a cheapo, but they were scrumptious while they lasted.

I was thinking I would be getting a soft, moist chocolate cake with creamy filling - similar to a hostess cupcake but with the "oreo taste" - these things are awful. The cake is stale in its consistency - this is not an old or opened package - bought em soon as they hit stores. The icing is about the same as the cookie - not creamy. The cake part is really just plain awful!! Stick to hostess cakes or plain oreos.

review/text: I can guarantee every reader of this review that not a single taste test was conducted for this horribly inferior snack cake. Maybe it was my epectation for something delicious that would satisfy my hunger for something cakey and chocolatey. It has its share of chocolate but it takes like spoonfuls of flour flavored with an inferior chocolate powder. And it looks nothing like its picture on the package. There's barely a thin layer of cream, so that doesn't help at all.  Don't think for a moment that its a filled pastry. Its a brown ball of chalky flour and that's about it. A momentous, calamitous failure of epic porportions.

Nor are there any red-flag ingredients to worry about.  The bad news is that they are higher carb than I had hoped.

The texture is not crispy at all, and even borders on tasting stale. There were many crumbs in the bag, and the package has been downsized from 1.5 ounces to 1.2 ounces. Not much to like here anymore. I will be removing it from my subscribe and save. What a disappointment, because I really did enjoy them before.<br /><br />I am not allowed to review them independently but, there are several flavors if this product. At this time the Lemon Herb is still 1.5 ounces and the original formula. This could change at any time.

If you generally like soy items, than you will probably like these.  The soy taste, light as it is, is what most of my friends don't like about them.  Kids seem to like them better than adults.  And, I would say the parm. & the nacho flavors are better.  However, we like these too.

review/summary: Tasty, Messy High Protein Snack
review/text: As part of a high protein diet, I have conducted a broad search for the most protein-rich foods. It is easy to find cheeses, meat, and protein shakes loaded with protein. It is much more difficult to find flavorful high protein foods that are traditionally carbohydrate rich.  Kay's makes a few good snack offerings that meet this requirement, including the Parmesan Cheese protein chips. At a cost of approximately 0.05 dollars per gram of protein, the protein affordability is on par with reasonably priced cheeses and meats but more expensive than protein shakes.<br /><br />Taste is matter of preference but I can say these snacks are indeed tasty from my perspective. Yet, they don't taste like other mainstream snacks such as Doritos or Cheetos. Hence, you may be inclined to eat them in moderation.<br /><br />One big downside to this snack is the volume of crumbs created when eating. Oddly, many of the Kay's chips are far messier than mainstream alternatives. So, while Parmesan protein chips may make a nice snack while watching television, expect to eat over a large bowl or table napkin. Otherwise, you will have a mess of crumbs that will find their way into every crevice of your furniture.<br /><br />High protein foods are typically more expensive than foods rich in carbohydrates or fats.  So, I have recorded the nutrition of about 200 foods to find the best value in terms of lowest dollar cost/gram of protein. An excerpt is below. As you can see, the chips are a reasonably good value at 0.05 dollars/gram.  A typical strength athlete might need as much as 1 gram/kg of weight daily.  This would equate to about 10 dollars of chips per day for a 220 pound (100kg) athlete if eating nothing but Kay's protein chips. While not realistic, it gives consumers an idea of the expense involved. So, if you like the taste and can store a full case, they make a tasty component of your high protein diet at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />Pros<br />Taste<br />Moderate protein cost<br /><br />Cons<br />Extremely messy<br /><br />PARTIAL RANKED LIST OF PROTEIN RICH FOODS<br /><br />SOURCE .....

review/summary: A decent snack option for low carbing
review/text: I just received these, tore open the box, and snarfed down a bag.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviews, I did find these crunchy --they weren't soggy or soft at all. Overall, I like them because it's pretty hard to find salty crunchy snacks on a low carb diet. These compare to Medifast's Parmesan Snacks with the exception that these are flat and Medifast snacks are little balls, but overall the flavor is pretty much the same. Also, these are a MUCH cheaper option than Medifast or any of the other high protein low cal diet product, who charge about $15 for a box of 7. At the sale price of $9.25 for a box of 12, that's less than .80 cents per serving. Good deal.<br /><br />And, speaking of servings, I have a pet peeve for the manufacturer... the bag is 1.5 oz but the nutrional facts are based on a 1 oz serving. Gimme a break. Who's going to eat only two thirds of the bag and leave the rest? They tout 110 calories, but realize that you're actually going to get 155 calories, 5.25 grams of fat, 21 grams of carbs (not net carbs cuz this does have some fiber), and 15 grams of protein when you eat a whole bag. This still isn't horrible, so why not just tell us what we're going to get when we eat the whole little bag, which we will do :-).<br /><br />Also, these little chips do crumble easily. I think there were maybe 5 whole chips in my bag, the rest were smashed (but still tasty). Overall, I recommend this and for the price point, flavor, texture, and lack of other options. I will repurchase.<br /><br />Lastly, kudos to Amazon. I got free shipping through Prime and they were on my doorstep in 1 day.

review/text: Due to medical reasons I have to be on a high protein, lower carb diet.  These are a great snack.  It's nice to have something to crunch on instead of potato chips or tortilla chips.  The taste of these is okay.  I personally prefer the Kruncheez by Kay's Naturals.  While these don't totally taste like Parmesean, they do have a nice flavor.  The only reasons to not give 5 stars are that they don't really taste like the flavor specified, and each bag has 1.5 servings.  I really think the bag should be one serving when they are this size.

review/text: This is the first product I have ever reviewed.  I shop a lot on Amazon and rely on reviews and they have always helped me.  This product is so bad, that I felt I had to warn others.  I purchased it looking for healthy low fat snack.  First off, the package says low fat.  They may be low fat, but the chip is as greasy as they come.  Next, the chip has no snap too it.  It is soft and melts.  Not something you want in a chip.  Worst of all is the taste.  The cheese flavor is prominent but nasty.  Overall, avoid this product.  I should have been tipped off by the price, which is fairly low for a supposedly healthy and gluten free product in this quantity.

review/summary: Great alternative especially for fitness fanatics
review/text: When I opened up the whole case of protein chips, I was quite overwhelmed since I thought, WOW. Did I go a little overboard with this? I could not believe I bought a whole case without trying it first.<br />Anyway, I opened up one box just to taste it and it did not taste good at first. But as I kept on eating it, it just got better and better. I ended up eating this box all day periodically from morning till the end of my work day. Uh-oh, one box equals 5 servings. YIKES.<br /><br />As a fitness fanatic, I keep a high protein-low carb diet. This is an excellent substitute to my craving for potato chips and salty snacks. Unfortunately, there aren't that many healthy, salty snacks to choose from (I do not have a sweet tooth like the rest of the world). The Chili nacho flavor creates a party in my tummy, I wish it was spicy though but it does the job.<br /><br />So a whole case of Kay's protein chips?? Yeah, no problem!

review/summary: tastes great, filling, best "fake junk food" find
review/text: These really fill that need for something salty and crunchy while not actually being junk food. The nutrition info speaks for itself. The chips are small, so the bag takes a long time to munch through, so you don't feel like you took two bites and ran out. Their texture is similar to puffed rice/wheat/corn junk foods, like bugles or salsa fries. They kind of dissolve after the first initial crunch, as opposed to a chip made from a slice of potato, which just breaks into smaller hard pieces. This is my favourite flavor - the parmesean isn't bad, but this is really late-night-I'm-stoned-and-playing-video-games junk food goodness.

review/summary: Yes Yes Yes Thanks for Healthy Snacks Like This One
review/text: These "chips" are really freaking good for being so healthy. The thing is, you have to know what to expect when you are eating a high protein/fiber product like this one. It is not going to taste like a potato chip so kiss that fantasy goodbye if that is what you are expecting. I suppose some people have extremely refined taste buds when it comes to chips and have a hard time stomaching these. But seriously, they are extremely good, even you don't care a whole lot about them being healthy. They are crunchy and crispy and have a good dose of flavoring on them, and they are not too salty. These are perfect for people who want to add more protein to their diet in an easy way. I take a bag to school or on trips and they are awesome, especially good for days when I work out a lot. The price for these is really good too, especially if you score some extra savings with Amazon. As an afternoon snack, these beat anything you'll find in a vending machine price- and health-wise. It is products like this one that make my life a little easier so I don't have to struggle to eat healthy while being busy!

review/summary: One of the best low-carb snacks you can buy
review/text: If you're doing a low carb diet or even just want to cut down on them then these are really some of the best low-carb chips you can buy.<br /><br />Taste/Texture: They don't REALLY taste like chips but honestly its close enough to, say, a dorito, that it works. The texture is different, a little lighter than a chip which may be a positive for some people. You definitely get the chili nacho cheese flavor from it and in my opinion it's about the closest you're going to get to a "real" chip if you're looking for low carb. Haven't tried the other flavors though.<br /><br />Size: The bags are small, yes, but not that much smaller than a regular small sized bag of chips. You might find yourself eating more than one bag as a snack though.<br /><br />Price: Pretty good when you buy the bulk (12 pack) product although it works out to about a dollar a bag which IS a little pricey I guess but when you look at it as "12 dollars for a pack of 12" somehow, to me, it seems like a better deal. Also, if you like them, sign up for the regular deliveries and it shaves 2 dollars off each order AND includes free shipping so you really can't beat that. Considering the high price of a lot of speciality products (and this is) it's pretty inexpensive.<br /><br />Overall: A good purchase for low carb dieters, a tasty chip substitute, something even fans of traditional chips may enjoy. Good value.

review/text: These chips taste okay - although I probably would have liked the Nacho flavor better, they were 3 dollars more a case at the time I made my purchase. The main problem with these chips, is half of every bag is protein powder at the bottom of the bag, so your stuck trying to scoop it up with your fingers or end up just throwing it out. I guess, in trying to make them low fat, the oils that usually hold chips together is missing, so you end up with half a bag of crumbs. I ordered 3 cases and every bag is like this, so I don't believe it's an isolated problem.

I can't really say much about the crackers themselves as they don't really stand out in any way (this isn't to say they're bad, they're most definitely not), they're just crackers, EXCEPT---you get a great amount of protein from one little bag (a 1.5 oz bag has 15g of soy protein and 4.5g of fiber, which is not too bad).<br /><br />The calorie count for the same 1.5 oz bag is 165, the fat count is 5.25g, which isn't super great, but it's way better than the count from the same amount of potato chips and you're getting much more protein and also fiber, so not too bad if you have a craving for something salty and seasoned.  Also, they're just more satisfying.  You don't feel the urge to immediately eat another bag like you often do with chips.  Probably because of the soy protein and fiber, huh? &lt;g><br /><br />If there had been a choice for 4.5 stars, I would have taken it, but just couldn't go to the 5 for some reason, but I'll definitely be buying them again just to have on hand when the craving for salt and spice hits.  Which, unfortunately for me, is quite often.  Oh well, there are worse things I could do... &lt;VBG>

review/summary: Good Crunch, bland taste
review/text: These chips are nice and crisp with out being too hard. The taste is somewhat bland and does not taste much like parmesan, but it they still make for a decent snack.

review/summary: Cardboard *blah*, not refundable
review/text: I was really looking forward to a salty savory crunchy break from the usual sweet protein shakes and  protein bars.  This one was lousy.  The chip is crunchy, salty and savory but the after taste is unbearable.<br /><br />Also, I should have read the fine print... these are not refundable.  I suggest that you should purchase one before buying an entire box.  My mistake, but after reading so many rave reviews I thought I'd like it.  Just goes to show you that everyone has different taste buds.

review/summary: Not that great
review/text: These protein chips definately weren't that great.  I can't say they were awful but they have a really grainy dry kinda taste.  I think they would be good with dips, but I have only eaten them plain.  I ordered the 12 pack and still have 11 boxes left lol.  I would recommend sampling them somehow, try 1 box if you can, instead of 12!

review/summary: Not the Protein chips I ordered
review/text: I ordered the "Better Balance" Protein chips that were shown in the picture.  When I opened my shipment it was for a different type of protein chip that does not taste nearly as good.  Very dissapointed!!

review/summary: I like them.
review/text: they look nothing like the picture on the package. they're pale, not brown, nor do they have indented creases or what have you. that was the first thing I noticed. I like these as a salty crunchy snack that I can feel good about eating: low calorie, protein. some pieces DO taste a little bitter, but I don't mind. they really taste like PASTA. some pieces are light & crispy which I enjoy most.

review/summary: These are Delicious!
review/text: I am on a high protein, low carb, low fat, low sugar diet. More than sweets I crave salty chips and crackers, something to munch on in front of the TV. These are delicious! If someone told me they were bad for me I would believe it. They don't necessarily taste like anything else on the market...maybe a wheat thins toasted chip? They are very crunchy and light not heavy or gritty like other high protein crackers. The only downside is that each individual size bag is actually 1.5 servings and of course once it's opened, I am going to eat it all because I have no self control. These are going to become a staple in my diet from here on out, the perfect substitute for potato chips, without that guilty feeling after.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I tried the Nacho Chili chips last time and figured I'd try a new flavor. These Crispy Parmesan ones are delicious. They taste similar to when a nicer restaurant makes fried parmesean to top on salads. Really good! It's the same 110 calories, 10 gm protein as the other one but I personally think it tastes so much better than the Nacho Chili flavor.

review/summary: Pretty darn good
review/text: I'll be honest, I bought these on a whim because I needed another item to push me over the minimum for SuperSave shipping.  I was browsing pantry items because I figured I might as well buy something I'd need anyways, and I came across these chips when looking for healthy snacks.  While I'm not typically a big consumer of "natural" foods (nothing against them, I just don't go out of my way to sneak them out), I try to stay away from obviously unhealthy foods and thought it couldn't hurt to try these as a substitute for less-healthy snacks like chips.  My expectations weren't very high, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that these chips are really pretty tasty.  They're salty and crunchy yet not greasy.  I'm not saying I wouldn't prefer regular old potato chips all else equal, but if you're looking for a healthy alternative and debating giving these a try, I say go for it (because we all know "all else" isn't really equal...).

review/summary: Hmmm, where do I begin?
review/text: These are weird little chips. They are nice and crunchy. The flavor is OK... but not good. The bags have 1.5 servings in them (so if you eat the whole bag they are 21 carbs; not 14). I doubt I will buy them again, but I will eat the rest of the carton.

review/summary: Good low-fat snack
review/text: A tasty, healthy option to high-fat potato or tortilla chips.  You won't confuse these with Doritos, but they're good to curb your craving for a high-fat snack without all the calories.  Haven't tried the other flavors yet, but the chili nacho cheese is good.

review/summary: Not a picky eater but EWWWW
review/text: Honestly, at first they tasted good, but after the second bag the taste was unbearable!  My buddy who eats just about anything couldn't even finish a bag! haha.  I don't know how these other people are eating these, but this product is not what I would want to eat.  Also, there are 1.5 servings per little bag FYI (i.e. not much protein and fairly caloric- much much better off buying protein powder or eating chicken).  I hate to bash this product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this one.

review/text: The spicy flavoring on the chips is not bad and the chips are nice and crunchy.  The chips themselves though, taste terrible.  Somewhere between plain flour and dirt with a chemical tinge.  No thanks.

review/summary: These were really bad
review/text: I have had the nacho chili, and they were great.  This was really terrible. Grandkids wouldn't eat them, the smell grossed them out.<br /><br />Smelled sort of musty and stale or something.  Just a foul smell upon opening the bags...I guess a Poor combination of herbs with the lemon.<br /><br />They became expensive dog treats.
