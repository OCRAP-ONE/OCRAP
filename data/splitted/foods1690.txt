review/summary: does not play well with water
review/text: Pro:<br />- I think that it tastes pretty good and tend to dilute it more than the packet to 8 oz of water.  The taste is almost identical to diet tang.<br /><br />Con:<br />- Does not mix well at all with water.  It clumps up into floating balls that dodge your mixing spoon.  If you invest the 15 minutes it takes to get it to dissolve be sure not to let the residue dry to your glass since it sticks like a paste glue.<br />I've tried putting it in the glass first and adding water (nightmare)<br />Fill glass first and add the powder which floats and mixes poorly<br />Mixing it in a bottle that you can close and shake works 'ok' but who has an 8 oz shaker??

review/summary: Works very well for this old guy.
review/text: I'm a middle aged guy they never eats right.  Not an athlete by any stretch of the imagination.  Never tried any energy drink before, tried this just on a whim.  It works.  I was drinking one dose every few days when I felt I really needed it, and it worked well.  Then I started drinking two doses per day as recommended on the packaging and I really feel much-much better all day.  My wife is enjoying it also, lol.  I've talked to my pharmacist, and did some searching around the web, and can't find any negatives about the ingredients.  One odd thing is that the different types (can, powder, chewable) seem to have slightly different formulations.  Sugar content is higher in some then others, so pay attention to that if you're diabetic.<br /><br />This is the powdered version.  I find the taste to be a little better then the canned version.  Although neither is going to win any prizes in that regard.

review/text: My husband travels quite a bit so the FRS packets come in handy during the travel weeks.  The FRS packets are extremely convenient and come in a variety of flavors.  I have done my research online and Amazon seems to offer the best price with the Free Shipping for Subscribe and Save items and the lower price with the program.  If you drink FRS, this is a terrific method to receive the product at a great price with the convenience of having it delivered to your doorstep!

review/summary: Unbelievable effect on your brain and body!!!!
review/text: FRS is one of the least known products on the market.<br />Yet, amazingly, has the most beneficial effects on your mind and body, over anything I've ever experienced.<br /><br />For your body: take 1 packet and mix with 8oz of cold water, 20 minutes before you work out i.e. weights/aerobics/jogging. Your level of strength and endurance will increase demonstrably, and actually exceed your expectations by a very wide margin.<br /><br />For your mind: take one packet and mix with 8 oz of cold water, 20 minutes before you stress your brain with complex tasks, i.e. working on math spread sheets, studying, memorizing, reading and absorbing difficult subject matter, playing piano through memory or reading the sheet music, cross word puzzles...the list is endless. The results of FRS on your brain will be in a word...unforgettable. Also, if you're socializing and having  one or more cocktails, take FRS before you start, and you will stay sober when everyone else around you becomes impaired. A sure fired way to become the "designated driver."<br /><br />This is the first opinion I've ever given on a product. And NO I'm not being paid to write this...trust me, you won't be sorry.....Kevin Taylor

review/summary: Way Too Much Acid in this Drink
review/text: I tried to drink this a few different ways, even with half the mix.  And it was MUCH too acidic. Yes, I do have acid reflux problems.  But I have no problems drinking things like Vitamin Water and Gatorade.  I couldn't handle this drink.<br /><br />On the flip side, I did feel pretty good after drinking this.  I think the energy part works.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend you stay away from the powdered version if you don't have an iron stomach.<br /><br />I haven't tried the concentrate or the regular drink that comes in cans.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Tried out the Low-Cal Wild Berry that comes in the can and it wasn't too acidic.  Don't know what the deal is with the powder.

review/summary: Just Okay
review/text: After drinking the powdered energy drink offered at the supermarket I thought I would reward myself and experiment with this more costly product.<br />I found it hard to mix well, the tiny clumps were few, but in the three boxes I purchased I have yet to mix a drink that has not had them in it. It doesn't bother me but this is a review. The orange flavor and lemon lime flavor I found acceptable and what I expected. It is recommended to consume 30-60 minutes prior to activity. It may be imagined but I feel a little rush within minutes of consumption but it only last a few minutes and I see no notice in my exercise before, during or after. The powdered energy drinks I buy at the supermarket have caffeine and an immediate and sustained zing for my exercise which I prefer.<br />FRS is not a caffeine drink but because it is an energy drink I expected more. I will not buy again.

review/text: This product lived up to its hype. Gave a great jump start to my day. I drink it during my morning workout. Not one to drink anything but water and black coffee, I added more water than recommended. Nice flavor, for you old folks, kinda reminds me of Tang. Only problem is that it doesn't stay mixed. Not a problem if you added it to a water bottle, just give it a shake before you take a sip.

review/summary: Not quite as good as the canned version
review/text: I ordered this because I couldn't find the cans in a real store, and shipping liquid can get expensive.  The taste wasn't quite as good and it still had that hint of something odd (most likely the quercetin). It took a few minutes to dissolve, but that's not a big deal to me.  The cans also seemed to have a slightly more noticeable effect, but the powder was still effective.<br /><br />The only thing that is a bit confusing is how prevalent low calorie and "diet" version are, considering this drink is marketed as a natural form of energy.  I would think that people that chose natural energy drinks over redbull/monster would be able to accommodate the extra 100 calories from sugar/honey and prefer that over all those artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Summary: buy the can if you can, but the powder works well too

review/summary: Good product for a good price
review/text: FRS energy drink didn't give me the sudden off-the-wall jolt that 5 Hour energy did, but that's okay. The gradual increase in energy that I felt was just as effective. I didn't feel a sudden crash at the end, although the lack of sleep did catch up to me eventually after 4-5 days. There's only so much of this stuff my body could take.<br /><br />I tried the orange flavor--tastes like Tang (yum!). And it's made with more natural ingredients than 5-hour energy, which is good because it didn't give me nasty side effects from drinking too much of it (I finished a whole 14-count packet during finals week).

review/summary: Better than the liquid concentrate
review/text: My husband needs that extra kick towards the end of the day - without the jitters or bad ingredients.  This works.  The powder works well because it seems to last all day.  Yes, it does clump, but that is actually a benefit as you can just keep adding water to your water bottle, shaking, and have a continued drink.<br /><br />Recently we tried the liquid concentrate.  The taste wasn't as good as the powder, and it doesn't last as long.<br /><br />My husband uses one full packet a day.  I've found that I only need half a packet.  I also found that mixing it with sparkling water makes it tastes like an orange soda.  I no longer crave regular sodas.<br /><br />This product gives you all the energy you need, without any rush/drops and/or shakes.

review/text: I am sold on FRS.  I use the powdered orange product in a shaker about 30 minutes before a workout.  It gives me energy to do a harder workout, and longer. I am 55 years old and need the extra boost this provides.  It's not instant energy, but provides consistent energy.  A couple of times I've been working out and my energy level was low, and I couldn't figure it out until I realized I had not taken any FRS.  So, I'm positive it's not just a psychological lift.  Worth the money and the hype.

I tried the free internet offer, I just selected the option not to be enrolled in the monthly subscription and I've had no issues with having to cancel again or getting extra product. Direct from the website is about twice as much so i'll be ordering from amazon, sorry frs. I like the product I have to work out a lot at night and having an energy drink at 6pm tends to be a bad idea but frs helps some so I still can get in a good run even if I'm zapped from the day. Not anything like a redbull/monster but I felt that it helped me put out my best effort in a work out, like a few others commented I drink it about 30min before I work out and feel no jitters or buzz.

review/summary: Use it and love it.
review/text: I have used FRS products for about 3 months.  I have found that I seem to have an increased energy level during and after work outs during which I consume an FRS product.  Placebo effect?  Possibly, but I do notice a difference when compared to using Gatorade/Powerade/Power Bar drinks.  This lo-cal orange powder is the best tasting of all the products I have tried.  To me, it tastes exactly like "Tang".  It is also the most convenient form to use.  The screw cap bottles and cans must be put into a bottle before use during exercising.  As for the issues about clumping, I put the product into a full water bottle, shake, and have not had any issues at all.<br /><br />Also, I just learned the FRS products are sold by amazon.com.  I must say that I first tried the product via the "sample pack" offered via the manufacturers website and have placed a number of orders since.  At no point have I had any issues with scams or being billed for unwanted product.  However, the prices on amazon are much, much cheaper so I will be buying here from now on.<br /><br />Lastly, even if you dispute the effectiveness of quercetin, the drink is still better than Gatorade and related sugar drinks as FRS products are made from natural ingredients and contain 100+% of a number of important vitamins.

review/text: Controversy aside, I'm a big fan of FRS, and I supplement with it on the daily.  These packets are handy to keep in a drawer in the office, and the flavor is almost as good as from the can or the liquid concentrate.  I only gave 4 out of 5 because it doesn't mix very well.  Even with vigorous shaking, you still have some sediment in the bottom.  It's not a big deal though because it's not gritty and doesn't funk up the flavor.  For home, the liquid concentrate is the only way to go, IMHO.  When you are on the go, though, these are great.

This Low Cal version contains Sucralose which is what is in Splenda.  This is a synthetic man-made sugar substitute that goes through a chlorinic process.  Studies claim it's harmless to humans, but they also thought this about nutrisweet.  Google Sucralose and you be the judge.  Only the "low cal" products from FRS contain Sucralose.  Unfortunately all of their powder mixes are "low cal".  Their regular concentrate, chews, and can items do not contain Sucralose (non low-cal).  FRS should be ashamed of themselves as their tag line is "Healthy Energy".<br /><br />================================================================================<br /><br />I've been using FRS for over 2.5 years on subscription and love it.  It is a fantastic product that does what it says.  For the skeptics, all I can say is that the proof is in pudding.  I haven't been sick in over a year and we have elementary aged kids whereas without it I was sick every 3 months with something or another.  FRS surely helps with performance be it athletic or in my case hard core focus in developing Multimedia.  I use the orange powder mix, convenient, refreshing, and you can mix it to your liking with more or less water.<br /><br />The 3 star rating is for the most recent as of July 2010 "Improved Dissolving Formula" mix.  It surely dissolves better but the taste is completely different.  The original formula is refreshing and doesn't leave an aftertaste, the latest doesn't taste as good, leaves my throat dry, and has a light Orange Julius after taste.  I was so disappointed by this change that I called FRS to see if they had any old stock that I could stock up on and there was none to be had.  The new formula is here to stay because in a "focus group" people wanted the powder to  dissolve better.  Well I do too, but why change the flavor as well.  And I'm not sure if it's a psychological thing or not, but I don't seem to get the same energy push from this "Improved" formula.<br /><br />Please FRS, bring back the original formula or at least offer it as an option:  "Original Orange" or "Better Dissolving Orange Julius".<br /><br />===============================================================<br /><br />Edit as of Feb 16, 2012  I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 5 as the taste seems to be closer to the pre "Improved Dissolving Formula".  Every now and again though I'll get a box that is a tad tartier than usual but nothing like the first batch I got of the new formula.  Save money and time and subscribe through Amazon.com.  I originally had a subscription directly through FRS per their promotion.  Prices are much better here on Amazon and the response time can't be beat.  There were times when I would run out of FRS before my next ship date with FRS.com and just to have extra shipped to me before my next shipment usually took  7-8 business days.  Too slow.<br /><br />For the naysayers, I use 2-3 packets regularly everyday, 4-6 when the kids are home sick or if I start to feel something coming on.  Works like a charm in boosting my immune system.  This past week all my kids were home with fevers and coughs (flu) and I skated by with just a minor throat tickle.  Of course the extra FRS in combination with extra sleep and good diet does the trick.  Your results may vary.  Years ago my wife use to get sinus infections every 3 months like clockwork, year in, year out.  We started FRS (she does the Lime chews) and went in for a routine checkup upon which her Doctor said "Wow, I haven't seen you in a while".  Turned out she hasn't been in to the Doctor for a little over a year.  That's peace of mind for your health and pocketbook.  The minor cost of FRS far outweighs a trip to the doctor + copay + antibiotics + inconvenience + being miserable  Try it, it's truly something we can't do without.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: In an attempt to get away from high caffeine energy drinks a tried the free trial of FRS energy.  For 5 bucks they sent be a a two week supply of the orange concentrate and a two week supply of the lemon lime powder.  The lemon lime powder was by far the worst of the two.  As some of the other reviewers have already explained, it does not mix with water even with vigorous shaking/stirring.  Instead it turns into this chunky, multi-green, sewage looking crap (HORRIBLE).  The taste is not that bad, but by no means great.  I tried the mix 3 mornings in a row and threw it up once and the other two mornings sat in class just trying not to throw up.  It did not set well with my stomach for some reason.  Furthermore, I did not gain any type of useful energy from it.  However, I would recommend the organge cocentrate.  It mixes easily, tastes much better, sets better in the stomach, and does provide some useful energy.  In fact, I found myself more concentrated and energetic throuout the entire day when using the organge concentrate.  Dont bother with this Lemon Lime stuff, trust me.

review/summary: Decent product; packaging needs work.
review/text: The low-calorie versions of FRS are the best energy drinks I've sampled so far. The wild berry flavor was a little weird at first, but once I got used to it it tasted just like the raspberry flavor of Crystal Light. One serving sustains me through a an hour-long workout consisting of interval and weight training without adding an unacceptable amount of calories to my diet.<br /><br />However, the tops of the individual packages don't tear off cleanly and must be snipped with scissors, defeating the whole purpose of the "convenient", portable packaging. If you try to pour the package into a container of water without snipping the top clean off, things can get messy and being berry-colored, this stuff stains pretty bad. Also, the powder doesn't dissolve very well unless you shake the bottle real good.<br /><br />I plan to keep using this product and will be thrilled if FRS fixes the problems.

review/text: Here are the cons:<br /><br />1. Its way too expensive<br /><br />2. It mixes terrible. The best way to mix it is putting it in a water bottle and shaking it.<br /><br />3. The energy effect is marginal. This isn't redbull or Emergen-C.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. I love the taste.<br /><br />2. Your not going to get fat on the 10 calories per serving diet flavors.<br /><br />If you have never tried FRS before, I'd recommend picking up a 4 can pack at GNC (or you can order it online.) If you hate it, your not going to like this.<br /><br />Personally I drink it two or three times daily and have been for the past three months. I started with cans but the weight and space that takes up is fairly significant. I switched to the powder, which definitely is different, but it is an acceptable replacement.

review/summary: No More Monster For Me!
review/text: As most of us try to fit many different things into one day, we usually need a pick me up when we're feeling sluggish. That used to come in the form of energy drinks like Monster, Rockstar, or Red Bull for me.  Even though I drank the "Lo-Carb" versions, that stuff had way too much caffeine in it.  I decided to try FRS and I haven't touched another energy drink since.  If you drank Tang when  you were a kid, like me, then you'll love this. If you didn't like Tang, then you probably won't like the flavor of this. It has plenty of B vitamins and a small amount of caffeine.  For me, it seems like it started working better after I used it a few times.  So if you don't feel that much energy the first time, try it again.  And at about $1.20 a drink, it's much cheaper than those crappy energy drinks.

I was using one or two packets per day (less than the recommended amount) and I even tried diluting it more than recommended to make it less strong/concentrated, but it still caused problems. The problems went away when I stopped drinking it.  While I like the taste and the convenience of the powder packets, it's not worth the gastric disturbance.

review/summary: A sports drink with one caveat
review/text: I first tried FRS when I got a free sample in a package I ordered from a bike shop here on Amazon.  To be honest, most drinks that cost this much is almost criminal in that most buyers thinking that they are getting some sort of magic potion to make them feel better, run faster or jump higher.  Most of the time you would be better buying sugar free Kool Aid and adding a couple of vitamin tablets to it.  There is no scientific basis for sports drinks except for one caveat.  If you sweat a lot during your exercise, you will do yourself a favor by replacing electrolytes and a few calories but stay away from a lot of sodium salts.  Having said that, this drink and many others should not be used by people who have GERD (gastro-esopogeal reflux disease) as it will cause reflux and heartburn due to the citric acid in the drink.  Overall, this drink and many others really have no value for most people and considering the price of these additive type drinks, you can purchase a membership in a health center and then drink water when your there.  I am a bicyclist and often ride in very hot, humid weather and I drink a watered down sports drink, but its cheap and only has a few calories and can be purchased at a local big box store.  Save your money and don't buy expensive drinks like this one.

review/summary: The placebo effect is powerful
review/text: I have been a doctor for 50 years. In that time there are now probably 1000 times as many medications and 500 times more medical procedures. Every one of them in order to be accepted has to undergo what is called a double blinded, placebo controlled study. An appropriate number of patients have to be recruited. In the case of Lipitor it was 10,000. 5000 took Lipitor and 5000 took the placebo, which looked exactly like the Lipitor pill. None of the patients or nurses or doctors knew who got what. All of the patients were seen often and after 5 years Pfizer broke the code and discovered that the Lipitor treated group had 50% less heart attacks, strokes and death. Every pill and every procedure has to be tested this way if it is to get on the market. FRS has never been tested this way and never will. The beneficial effects of this product depend on the placebo effect. If you believe something will benefit you because you have read many + testimonials there is a very good chance you will experience a benefit. Of course drinking a potion and expecting to, and then feeling better is a piece of cake compared to the potion actually curing cancer or healing an ulcer. You wouldn't want to go to your doctor when you are very sick and get a placebo. FRS depends on + comments of users and the celebrity endorsement of one of the greatest athletes in history. Does Lance say he won the Tour de France because of FRS? If he did would that be cheating?<br />Cleaves M. Bennett MD

review/summary: Expired Items- very disappointed :(
review/text: I jumped at this deal when I saw it because is was on sale and at such a bargain.. I bought two baskets.. when the basket arrived, my little nephew opened it and we were horrified when he complained that the chips have such an oily smell and are gross. I checked the expiration dates and most of the food expired ( I ordered on April 23 and the food expired on Feb 2012, with one or two item 04/2012). I wished I had known this information because if I had ordered it for a gift, which was what I had in mind, it would be so embarrassing to send out a gift with expired items. Very unpleasant experience.. HOWEVER, Amazon customer service team is amazing and they took care of the issue promptly and I am very happy with the end result. It's good to have that assurance that even if the products disappoint you, Amazon WON'T!!!

review/text: After recently finding out I have a wheat (or gluten)intolerance, I am having to give up everything I like to eat and/or finding gluten-free substitues.  In my journey I have run across these granola bars and I must say, "Wow!  Those really SUCK!".  I mean, come on.  If you can't make something taste good with peanut butter than don't even try.  They are truly terrible and the person who titled their review "inedible" had it pretty much correct.<br /><br />If you are already on a gluten free diet and are use to tasteless food items that seem to be made out of sawdust then you might agree with the people who liked them.<br /><br />There has to be better out there.

review/summary: Taste BAD!
review/text: I am being FORCED to go on a gluten free diet by my doctor. So I basically thought I had to give up my love and craving for sugary snacks. So I bought these thinking that they would satisfy that craving, that is the opposite of what happened. I ate one bar trying to convince myself the whole time that it tasted good but how much longer could I possibly lie to myself? They are hard, bitter, and tasteless. The rest of the pack has been sitting in my kitchen for a month now and I just can't bring myself to eat them. What kind of a SNACK is THAT?

review/text: She loves these - would eat them all day if I didn't stop her! I think they taste very similar to non GF granola bars - they are a bit tougher, not as mushy, as others, but still good.  My daughter has been GF for 5 years, so she really has nothing to compare them too. These are one of the few GF foods her brothers would steal from her (if I didn't stop THEM). Because they are so expensive, they are not allowed to eat them, only my GF girl.

I carry them in my golf bag for a great snack to get me through the back nine. I can only carry them in golf bag in cooler weather, however, as the chocolate gets melted and messy. But I love them.

We keep a few in my purse for the "hungries" after school and when I know others are sending granoloa bars for the rest of the team after playing baseball/softball.

For example it is better than the "off flavor" in Pamela's Choc Chip cookies from the flour mixture, not that Pamela's CC is the worst mind you. I did not find the bars to be stiff or hard, but it wasn't Quaker chewey either. I've only just tried them for the first time, so I don't know how the product quality varies over time.

review/summary: Love the Granola not the Granola bar
review/text: I love the Bakery on Main granola but the Granola Bar was a BIG disappointment!  I didn't mind the fact that it was super chewy but the taste is just...off.  I will continue to by the granola but NOT the granola bars.
