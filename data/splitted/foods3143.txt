review/summary: Do Not Buy unless you Eat Insects
review/text: We like mangosteen and we have bought cans of it imported from Asia in our local chinatown.  We tried this Organic product with high hopes.  First we found this mangosteen to be smaller in size than the cheaper stuff we buy locally.  Furthermore, in some cans this mangosteen has a redish tint; in others they are the white color we would expect.  But the last can we openned had an intact insect-apparently a large ant-attached to a mangosteen.  Unless you want to eat insects, there is no reason to buy this product.

review/summary: agreed, not very good
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer that this is not very good.  but, that said mangosteen and lychee are very close in taste and texture (we have a lychee tree and occasionally get mangosteen locally... in fact, I have a seedling :)) without looking  I am not sure you can tell them apart 9even fresh) dried, it just loses so much (i wouldn't go as far as accusing them of misrepresentation).  Unfortunatly for those of you who do not live in the tropics (and who may have heard raves about this "queen of fruit") it does not dry well; imagine drying an orange slice.  Myself, I think the mangosteen is a bit overblown ;) nice, but.. inflated. but that us just personal opinion.  Posting this review to say that this is a kind of strange product.  We tried it once when traveling and looking for healthy alternatives for snacks for our kids.  this may be healthy, but it doesn't taste like much.  If you are getting it to try mangosteen, this is not the way to do it. (tastes a bit like cardboard).  My kids gave me some to prove a point after I got it for them without trying it myself.

If you want a very quick hot cereal, add some hot water or milk to the granola and it softens quickly. The granola is great right out of the bag, on top of other cereal, etc. The price is very nice with the pack of 6.

review/summary: Unbelievably GOOD coffee!
review/text: I have to admit that the 20 years Starbucks says it devoted to developing an instant coffee worthy of the "Starbucks" name was time well spent. Whatever they did and however they did it, Starbucks has managed to create a super-rich tasting instant coffee that could easily be mistaken for their traditionally brewed coffee. The popular dark (Italian) and mild (Colombian) flavors are offered in very classy looking plastic pouches that conveniently turn 8oz of hot water into the best tasting instant coffee you've ever had. In fact, I had a difficult time telling it from their brewed coffee, and normally that's all I ever buy there. Although the price is a bit high - almost a $1 a cup - it's still a great alternative when you just can't find a walk-in store. I see a few packets taking cross-country flights with me, as well as stuffing a handful into my backpack when I camp. Heck, I'll never have to drink hotel-room coffee again! Hey Starbucks - when can I expect a "decaf" version?

review/summary: A Harsh Buzz
review/text: The taste of this coffee is decent, but nothing special. But then, after you drink it, watch out. It's a particularly harsh caffeine buzz. I'm not an expert, so I can't say why the effect of this coffee is so jittery, but after several cups, I've noticed on each occasion that after just one cup I immediately regretted it, feeling jittery and anxious. If you're caffeine sensitive, like me, try a different brew. This one's a bad trip.

review/summary: Do not put on ribs!
review/text: I was looking forward to experiencing this bacon sauce.  It really looked like it was going to be a great product.  So, I cook up three racks of ribs, and smother the bacon sauce all over it.  Great idea, right?  Wrong!  This bacon sauce did not taste good at all.  I have definitely had worse BBQ sauce before, but this was in the bottom five, for sure.  Then I looked at the label and I realized I was doing it all wrong!  It is not bacon sauce, it is bacon dog sauce!.  Once I tried the bacon dog sauce on an actual dog, it was much better.  This sauce really brings out some of the natural flavors that a dog has.  I would recommend this product to everyone!  Just make sure to do it right.<br />- Guangzhou, China

review/summary: Decent, but not great
review/text: When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a "gravy" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters.

review/text: Our nearby Fresh and Easy Market has an assortment of imported candies and they are fun to try. On my latest trip, I picked up a bag of Morinaga Hi-Chew Tropical Fruit Candies (Mango, Banana, Melon). They were quite good. First of all, they were quite chewy, but not enough to remove your fillings. Then the center of each was filled with the particular flavor you had chosen. I might add that each chew came individually wrapped and labeled.<br /><br />They are quite good candies. My reaction was they were not nearly as sweet as typical American Candies (these came from Taiwan, I might add). The inside flavors were light and  delicate, not overwhelming. Very nice taste and texture.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I was unable to find it anywhere online until recently, through Amazon. I was so pleased. The picture shows the "Macinato Fresco," however, it is labeled "Espresso Export." I'm not 100% sure if it's the exact blend that I was getting in Italy (it may be marketed under a different title), but it's just as smooth and rich, without the bitterness of many brands of espresso. If you're looking for a smooth, rich espresso, you'll enjoy Caffe Kimbo.

review/text: For well over a year, I have been using different types of hot sauce on different types of food.  Before I started doing this, I only ever remember using hot sauce on barbeque sandwiches.  Even though I have tried numerous types of hot sauce during this period, Chef Paul Prudhomme's Magic Pepper Sauce has set itself apart from the others as being one that I do not find to be striking.  I tried this hot sauce awhile back, and all I remember is that even though it was not terrible, it was not pleasing, either.  Recently, I was given another bottle of it and decided to give it another shot--I still think that it is just okay.  It is not too mild and not too hot, and it has a sugary flavor that I am not pleased with.  Overall, I consider this to be a dull hot sauce.  I am still glad that I tried it, though.  Actually, I rate this hot sauce 2.5 stars.

They absolutely love them, they are very, very crispy and require a bit of chewing, so they dont work that well to use as training treats (the lambs lung is much softer and they can chew it faster, which allows them to stay focused on the training and not the treat!) But they are great treats for our "quiet" time. Very big pieces, and even though they weigh heavier than the lambs lung (which you must try if you have not!) you still get a lot of healthy treats for your money! Great product and value!

review/summary: Love the blue popcorn!
review/text: This is the best popcorn ever.  I bought it previously from this same company & when it ran out I was so sad because it is a seasonal product & it wasn't available.  Stock up!  When I don't have it i use white popcorn from store, but this is without a doubt the best.

review/summary: Get the "blue" popcorn
review/text: The best popcorn I've ever made.  No joke.  I don't know about the other colors or flavors; I haven't tried them.  But the "Blue" popcorn is absolutely dynamite.<br /><br />Note:  it is not actually blue in color.  More of a cream color, like most popcorn.

review/summary: Very disappointed
review/text: We've been popping corn (not the microwave junk) 2-3x a week for many, many years. After this stuff was popped, it tasted stale and chewy...like it was popped a couple of days ago and left out.<br />The kernels are very, very small also and didn't have much flavor.<br />I was also surprised to see that the bag wasn't even airtight, which explains the stale popcorn.  There was no expiration date on the bag and it was closed with only a twist tie, so Lordy know how long it was sitting around.<br />Amazon refunded my money and I threw the rest of it out.  Although it's more expensive, I'm sticking with Orville!

review/summary: Nice popcorn, but not huge kernels
review/text: I was hoping this was the kind of gourmet popcorn that makes huge fluffy, round kernels. It's not. But it is a very good popcorn, almost good enough to eat without butter or salt. And it has the added benefit of having fewer little hulls to get stuck in your teeth. Incidentally, I've been using it exclusively in a hot air popper.

In fact, unless you like slightly sweetened chalk, don't get these.

review/text: This stuff is amazing! Doggie love's the green one (apples) the orange ones also. This is red so the dye in it can make your dog's stool darker in color / almost black. We freaked out the first time thinking he had blood in his stool but it's the dye. It is quite large so only give this to your dog if he is a larger breeder or larger puppy that's finished teething. FYI : this took 4-5 days to ship to me and I did pay shipping even though I had in my cart more than $25 worth of product. This is the smaller box. They offer this in a larger box. Very good, and great ingredients. Just read the label for the size and weight of product.

review/summary: Perfect for my purposes
review/text: First off let me say I know it's probably kind of weird for the average consumer to buy 64 ounces of soy sauce at a time. However, I and my husband make our own jerky and marinate steaks on a regular basis, so that is why we bought two bottles of this. Previously, we just bought it at the store but this was a more economical alternative and being soy sauce, it will store well. I'd have bought full gallons if it were available that way.<br /><br />I've never been able to tell a difference in taste between this lite version and the normal, so especially if you're watching sodium it is a good choice. We bought two of these and we'll probably use them pretty quickly.

review/text: I purchased this originally from an Asian food store local to me.  This was the first time I've tried low salt soy but found it very good and perhaps even better than "regular."  And, as I alluded to in my title, it's better for you since it adds less salt to your food.<br /><br />If you've never tried this before, and you use a lot of soy sauce, try this.  You'll find yourself very pleased.<br /><br />I also have to apologize.  Apparently I purchased the last two.  Sorry, it's certainly worth waiting for!

review/text: I couldn't understand why one of my dogs had almost daily diaherra but finally read that dogs find cornmeal difficult to digest - and it's in lots of different dog foods! Well, a trip to a fancy pet store yielded lots of samples for me to try on my dog and Taste of the Wild was a quick hit - loaded with protein -30% - any no grain at all. Corn is nowhere to be seen o\in the list of ingredients but bison, venison and fruits and veggies sure are. Naturally you have to pay more for such goodness - lots more - but my dog's digestive system is now fine and Taste of the Wild is the reason.

review/text: After trying MANY other foods I finally found this one!  I've found the food for us!  It's LESS expensive than most the other "premium" dog foods, and has better or equivalent ingredients!  My Black Lab Jade just would stick her nose up at other foods, but she goes crazy over this stuff, even has turned down canned food for it!  Both she and our four month old Golden Retriever's coats are softer than ever, and after two months time they still love the taste.  Never had a problem with their stools or throwing up.  AND, what I like best, is it's ALL stages of life, I can have both puppy and adult on the same food without worry!  Talk about saving out of pocket!  As y ou all can imagine, puppy wouldn't stay at his dish, he had to go to the other's dish, and vice versa.  Which concerned me, as adults eating puppy food, is not healthy.  Less money, taste tested, and great results in the coat/stool testings....  THANK YOU TOTW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />And to think, we don't even get bison or venison every day!!!!!!!!!!  They eat better than most folks!

review/summary: WARNING! Formula Change!!!!!
review/text: First of all I would like to say that my puppy LOVES this food! I have a 4 month old Lhasa Apso and he licks his bowl well after he has finished eating. When I first got him the breeder had him on Purina Puppy Chow. The first thing I wanted to do was to switch him to a high quality, no grain diet and after alot of research and reviews,Taste of The Wild always came on top(dollar wise). After the switch I immediately noticed a difference in my puppy.His coat is starting to shine and is sooooo soft to the touch. He has so much energy now and he has less eye discharge and less ear odor(due to being allergic to the Puppychow). My only problem I have with this product is when I went to my local pet store to buy him a 15lb bag. I immediately saw on the bag "Now made with Purified Water and More Bison" and I thought to myself; "wow they made it better", but after reading the ingredients boy was I wrong. They might have added more bison but they totally eliminated venison from the list. Venison was the second ingredient but now its lamb meal. What once this dog food had four meat products as its main ingredients(Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal) now has three(Bison, lamb meal, chicken meal). More bison or not the exclusion of venison takes away some of the "wildness" of the formula in my opinion. Sure it still has roasted venison down the list but it just that, DOWN the list. In my opinion they've downgraded the formula but are still charging the same price and I am a little concerned by that. I emailed the company for more info on the "New Formula" before I buy the bag and will post an update soon.<br /><br />UPDATE!<br />Just received an email regrading the formula change by the company;<br /><br />Dear Eric,<br /><br />"Thank you for your inquiry. I'm glad that your puppy has been doing so well on the Taste of the Wild High Prairie. The formula had to be changed because an adequate supply of quality venison was not available. The change is relatively minor with the venison being replaced with bison, already a part of the recipe. I would not expect you to notice a difference with your puppy. However, if you still have some of the food in the previous bag, I would mix the food from both bags for a few days to avoid any potential issues. If you do not have any food from the previous bag, you could add some plain nonfat yogurt to your puppy's diet for a few days to help prevent any issues. I usually recommend 1 tablespoon per 25 pounds body weight".<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />--<br />Melissa Brookshire, DVM<br /><br />Just to let you guys know that the formula change might cause some minor stomach issues so adjust accordantly.

review/summary: Quality ingredients! Would be ideal to mix with fat-reduced dry food
review/text: My two boys (a 3 years old Maltipoo and a 2.5 years Shih Tzu) used to have Eukanuba since they were little. A month ago, the local Petco informed me that Eukanuba was recalling some types of their dog dry food. It's a red flag in my mind! So I did more research and I fount out that Eukanuba is not worth how much I paid. To find the best food for my furry boys, I listed about 20 different products and kept narrowing down my list......<br /><br />THIS IS IT!!<br /><br />A website called DOG FOOD ANALYSIS gave this product a 6 star (the highest level of Dry Dog Food) and explained why they rated so. My boys easily jump into their new food on the first day~ I just wished that I can make this change earlier.<br /><br />The only drawback with TOTW High Prairie is: the FAT is relatively high, especially my boys are just family pets instead of working dog. I really need to pay attention on their weight control for health concern. The ideal protein for my small breed, adult dog is around 18% and recommended Fat is 9-15%. Because TOTW High Prairie has a minimum fat of 18% (refer to dogfoodanalysis.com), I usually mix it with Wellness Core Reduced Fat (Fat: 9-10%) to prevent overweight. They even love Wellness Core Reduced Fat more... I wish Wellness can have sale to make the price more affordable though.<br /><br />In a nutshell, if your dog is family pet like mine and has regular exerice, TOTW High Prairie would be the best choice at its ingredients and price. I will continue buying this product.

review/summary: lots of good ingredients-- holistic health approach-- but high fat and protein
review/text: My dogs like the taste of this food just fine, although they didn't go crazy for it. (I purchased it for a dog who was very thin and needed to gain weight.)<br /><br />The ingredient list of this food sounds great-- no corn or other indigestible grains, and lots of great healthy vegetables, fruits, and carbs in addition to high quality meats and probiotics. There are NO yucky "meat by-products"-- just meats and meat meals you can feel good about. Unfortunately this food has a higher than normal fat and protein content. Very high protein (minimum 32% in this food) may not be a good choice for every dog (this is especially a concern for older dogs). The fat percentage (minimum 18%) may great for working dogs and active dogs, but the average American couch potato dog could pack on pounds with that much fat unless you increase exercise and/or reduce your portion size (and that may lead to a dog who doesn't feel full/stays hungry).<br /><br />If your dog is already overweight you would probably want a food with one-third the fat of this product. If you decide to use this food I think it would be a good idea to monitor your dog's weight carefully to avoid having weight gain sneak up on you and your best pal. I am skeptical of dog foods which claim to be perfect for all life stages, too-- puppies and 15 year old dogs can survive on the same foods, but that doesn't mean the same foods are ideal for each dog.<br /><br />You might want to compare this with similar high-quality holistic foods such as Blue Buffalo Chicken & Brown Rice Adult Dog Food, 30 lbs.. (there's also a fish/sweet potato version) or Wellness Super5Mix Chicken Dry Dog Food (30-lb bag)) (there are several great Wellness varieties) or Nutro Natural Choice Ultra Adult Dog Food- net wt. 35 lbs. (there are several varieties of Nutro Ultra, too). These foods have the same high quality human grade ingredients, but appear to have a little bit lower protein and fat profiles.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's a list of the major ingredients/nutritional profile-- check it out, talk it over with your vet, and make up your own mind about whether or not this is a good choice for your best pal.<br /><br />Bison, venison, lamb meal, chicken meal, egg product, sweat potatoes, peas, potatoes, canola oil, roasted bison, roasted venison, natural flavor, tomato pomace, ocean fish meal, choline chloride, dried chicory root, tomatoes, blueberries, raspberries, yucca schidigera extract, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Saccharomyces cerevesiae fermentation solubles, dried Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract, vitamin E supplement, iron proteinate, zinc proteinate, and the expected added vitamins.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Wondering if your dog is overweight? An easy way to tell is to look down at your dog while it is standing. Viewed from overhead, you should see a definite "waist" narrowing in front of the back legs. Another easy test is to feel the dog's ribs. You should be able to easily feel slight dips between the ribs-- if you can't they are covered with a layer of fat (of course, prominent ribs mean your dog is too thin).

review/summary: Scratched much less than after cheap dry food
review/text: Vet told us micro mites may live in dry dog food, causing allergic reaction and intense lips scratching that we observed in our dog after eating - the problem that goes away with wet foods. We tried this brand of dry food and it also reduced scratching quite a lot.<br /><br />Taste-wise, still he wouldn't eat it alone, without mixing in something wet, so it didn't solve that "problem".

review/text: I had my female Husky on Blue Buffalo(which is a great product as well) but she just didn't like it. While looking for other good quality food I was recommended Taste Of The Wild by some of the members over at ItsAHuskyThing. As soon as I poured the food into her bowl she devoured it. She loves the Roasted Bison and Venison flavor. Overall, an amazing product.

review/text: After trying all the "recommended" brands with my poodle mix who is extremely picky, I decided to give Taste of the Wild a shot.  This is the only food (along with Wellness Core) that he will eat with any regularity.  I have tried the High Praire and the Wetlands formula and my dog seems to enjoy both equally.<br /><br />Everything I've read points to this being a well-balanced kibble and I have not noticed any issues from my dog after switching him to this food.  If my picky dog will eat it, it must be pretty good!

review/summary: Happy puppies.
review/text: I purchased the 5 pound bag along with two other brands for my two maltese puppies (they're about 4 years old) to try out. I got the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CLWS8">Taste of the Wild Dry Dog Food, High Prairie Canine Formula with Roasted Bison and Venison, 5 Pound Bag</a>, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018CICX6">Nature's Variety Dry Dog Food, Prairie Canine Chicken Meal & Brown Rice, 5 Pound Bag</a>. Out of the three, they happily devoured this one, sorta liked the Nature's Variety one, and completely ignored the Newman's Own brand. Besides the fact that my two little ones love this food, I don't know much of the details about this food such as fat content and whatnot. What I do know is that they love it more than the other two I tried and I'll happily recommend it.

I also read somewhere that because it is a better quality food, you do not need to feed as much as you would with an average food, so although it is a more expensive cost, you do feed less, so better in the long run.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great idea ruined by too much salt and MSG
review/text: I like Knorr products and have used them for many years.  I just wish they would reformulate them to cut out the MSG and reduce the salt.  These little cubes, which are a great idea, have 750 mg of salt in each one.  That's basically the entire cube!  They do have a nice onion flavor, but I'm not sure even that is natural onion flavor.<br /><br />Instead of these little cubes, I suggest McCormick's range of MSG and salt free seasonings (found here on Amazon, some with free super-saver shipping).  They come in large containers at a great price, and are a better choice for healthy cooking.

review/summary: Excellent product, tasty and versatile.
review/text: I like this product both for how handy it is but also for its versatility, how well it combines with other products, other foods and its nutritional value.<br /><br />I live on my own and I could make 4-bean salad easily enough by opening cans, but then I would have far too much for me to consume easily within a reasonable time and would waste far too much.<br />There is no waste with this product.<br />I usually mix it with fresh lettuces, other vegetables, with cooked grains (rice, quinoa, etc.) and with pasta - to make a one-dish meal.  The addition of meat or chicken adds protein and fat for a nutritionally complete dish.<br /><br />My only complaint was with the shipping the case was shipped in a box with a case of another canned product and with inadequate packaging material to keep them from banging together.  Two of the cans are dented (9 cans dented of the other product) so I will make sure that I do not order these items at the same time in the future and will not order anything else at the same time.<br />Amazon shipping is usually very good and the packaging is fine. In this case someone was either very careless or very lazy and I am disappointed.  I did not return the product because I was going to be away from home during the next several days.<br /><br />I recommend this product without reservation, just order it on its own.

review/text: "Sitting on the porch of a bungalow on a tea plantation in Darjeeling, you can see the peaks of Everest and Kanchenjunga as you sip a cup of this exquisite brew. Life is good." ~tea packet<br /><br />If you want a subtle tea with a smooth, soothing flavor, then Darjeeling is an excellent choice. The slightly floral flavor is much milder than an Earl Grey. I especially love this blend when eating a Caramel Apple Cobbler Clif Bar. For some reason, the flavors mingle nicely.<br /><br />While many of the Tazo teas are blends of a variety of teas, this tea is purely a blend of Organic Black Darjeeling teas. The tea is grown near India's border with Bhutan. There are only "true Darjeeling" tea leaves in this tea.<br /><br />This tea is just perfect when blended with an Organic Sucanat: Natural Sugar Cane. You might also want to try using "milk powder" instead of cold milk with your tea. I find it helps to keep the tea strength and adds a creamy element to the smoothness of this tea.<br /><br />Darjeeling is a very satisfying blend for morning tea. You might also enjoy AWAKE and Earl Grey if you enjoy this tea.<br /><br />I just love the packaging of the Tazo Teas. The individual wrappings have a nice crinkly sound and the colors are all so soothing and quite beautiful. These teas are definitely for the aesthetically aware. Drinking Tazo teas literally becomes a magical experience. There is something mysterious going on here. The teas even seem to have a magical glint or luster to them. When you drink Tazo teas the world looks more beautiful and you feel much more aware of life itself. I find that my creativity soars after drinking Tazo teas.<br /><br />For more information on the mysteries of Tazo Tea, read the review for the Tazo Assorted Teas.<br /><br />For a calming experience try the Tazo Calm Herbal Infusion which is perfect for quiet evenings, after completing a yoga workout or just to sip on while you write in your journal.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: Darjeeling Tea is a black tea from the Darjeeling region of the Indian state of West Bengal in the lower Himalayas. This is my favorite black tea. Tazo's is exactly what one should expect from a bagged Darjeeling tea. I won't bother to elaborate on the qualities of Darjeeling with adjectives such as "floral"--you can probably get all the subjective descriptions you need from Google. I pretty much will assume you know what Darjeeling tastes like (your local tea & coffee house should carry Darjeeling if you haven't tried it). If you want a good quality bagged Darjeeling this fits the bill. So too do several others (ie St. Dalfour).

Please mention this cereal if you like it at all, because I WANT TO KEEP GETTING IT, and someone needs to KEEP STOCKING IT! Thank you, POST, PLEASE DON'T STOP MAKING THIS CEREAL!!!!!!

review/summary: Great if you don't have fresh
review/text: This is actually a pretty standard product in our fridge, because we're not always up for grabbing fresh garlic, and usually by the time we get around to using all of it, it's gone bad. So a big thing of minced garlic is a convenient way to keep some on hand for those times when I'm doing meals on the fly and don't have fresh garlic available.<br /><br />The ones I've gotten don't have 'little hard bits' of garlic like one of the other reviews said, but it could possibly be the end pieces of cloves that were minced into the bunch. It doesn't taste sour to us either, but when you open it, the overpowering garlic smell punches you in the face for sure. I will recommend making sure to keep the threads of the cap clean, because the garlic juice can seep onto it easily and start to build up, and it will eventually get to a point where you can't open the lid because of the sticky juice buildup.<br /><br />All in all, I like having conveniently minced garlic on hand. Is it an amazing, can't-live-without product? No, but it's good to have all the same.

review/summary: Spice World Minced Garlic  48 oz.
review/text: Oh My gosh, I love this minced garlic. I can't believe I let myself run out--but thanks to Amazons Subscribe and Save, I was able to get my order early. I use this in so many things I cook. I know Garlic is suppose to help your health and I must be getting really healthy by now. I never used garlic much till I tried this Spice world Minced garlic.  Now almost every meal I eat has something I find to put the garlic in. I love it.

review/summary: smells like garlic-looks like garlic--tastes like ????
review/text: Garlic is a staple around here.  Whilst waiting for a batch of this season's fresh garlic I thought I'd give this a go.  I would say that this product is totally useless, takes up space in my fridge.  Very puzzling is the fact that not a hint of garlic flavor.  I am about to bin the whole jar.  What more can I say other than don't waste your money!
