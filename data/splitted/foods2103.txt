review/summary: Yeast expiration date
review/text: Since this type of yeast is no longer available at any of our local grocery stores, we decided to load up on this find by purchasing (3) packs worth which ends up being (45) individual yeast packets.  Problem is they arrived on 4/13/11 and the yeast expiration date is July 2011!  When we were able to get this product in our local stores, the expiration was minimally a year or more.  Since these packs cost double what the stores charge, this is ridiculous.  I guess we'll be eating pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner for the next 3 months before the yeast is useless!

review/summary: Great for quick/easy pizza crust
review/text: I agree with the other reviewer that Amazon's current pricing (as of Feb 2011) is ridiculous, being about double what my local HEB sells the stuff for. Having said that, I gave a 4-star rating because I think the product itself is to be recommended (just don't buy it from Amazon unless they lower their price). Prep time is about 5 minutes, and the resulting pizza crust is quite good.<br /><br />While some purists may scoff at a pizza crust that's ready to cook just minutes after making the dough, in my experience this stuff is far better than any of the other "instant" alternatives (for instance, stay away from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMOD5M">Betty Crocker Pizza Crust Mix</a> unless you want your pizza crust to taste like it was made with bisquick).

review/summary: Would Not Make Again!
review/text: Just made and tasted a pizza with this yeast.  I have been baking for over 25  years and have made pizza dough the traditional way with excellent results.  I was a bit skeptical of this dough but since it had the Fleishmann name, I gave it a try. I purchased yeast at local supermarket not Amazon.  I followed directions with exact measurements using regular flour.  My sauce was simply crushed tomatoes with basil, salt, garlic powder and olive oil. Topping:  Grated mozzerela cheese. Baked in a pizza pan with holes (provides for crisper crust and can be found in most retail stores)  Prep and cook time:  25 minutes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Quick to mix<br />Was easy to press onto pizza pan<br />A great time saver for busy familys<br />Kid friendly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Overpriced<br />Flavor 3 on a scale of 10<br />Crust was not chewy or crisp, biscuit like consistancy<br />Overall, I would not use this product again.  Felt it was a waste of good pizza toppings.  Will only use a traditional yeast to make my pizza crust in the future.

review/summary: Great Product, Horribly Overpriced
review/text: I've been buying this yeast for pizzas in the jar in my local supermarket for a year now ... until recently, when it went out of stock and I had trouble locating it. One jar = 16 pouches, according to the label.<br /><br />Well, out of desperation, I ordered these from Amazon not entirely sure if the description was accurate ... everything I've purchased from from Amazon has been a great deal, and I'm often surprised by how many units come in each pack.<br /><br />This time I was underwhelmed. You get what the description says. 3x 1/4oz pouches in a row, with 5 in a bag. For $12.55. A good $5.50 more than the jar I used to buy in my local store which had one pouch more product.<br /><br />In the end, it's my fault for ordering while hoping that Amazon had incorrectly listed how much you'd be getting ... this is just the first time I've ever known Amazon to rip grocery consumers off by charging almost double what you pay in a local supermarket.<br /><br />4 stars for the product, minus 2 for the price.<br /><br />Will not be ordering more unless the price is slashed to what it should be. This is way over MSRP.

review/summary: great microwave meal
review/text: Most of the time when I don't have a free minute to spare on going out to buy food, I microwave up one of these. They're delicious, healthy and easy/quick to prepare. Plus they're cheaper than going to a Japanese restaurant and having udon there. I eat these relatively often so I've solved most of the problems people had with the cooking process.<br /><br />I've found that the vegetables rehydrate best if you stick them under the loosened noodles and then fill the bowl up with water (just trap the vegetable square under the noodles). This solves the problem of the gritty tofu as well - mine always come out soft and chewy with that method. Also, if possible, microwave the noodle bowl instead of using boiling water. The noodles come out much softer and the miso paste dissolves easier if they're cooked in the microwave for the 2 minutes.<br /><br />I hope this helps the upset reviewers below. I have these at least once a week and they've become a rather delightful staple to my diet.

review/text: I buy these soup bowls and take them into work.  I usually work over lunch and they provide a fairly healthy light lunch (fairly because they are a little salty).  The dried tofu in them usually doesn't reconstitute well but everything else is fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is the biodegradable marketing gimic, a nice idea but I think it is mostly to make people feel better.  Nothing rots in the landfills.  And I tried putting one of these bowls in the compost heap, two years later it is still kicking around somewhere in the backyard (no it didn't rot).  The paper wrapper and plastic wrapper are certainly not compostable.

review/summary: A Decent, Quick Meal
review/text: This soup is a fairly tasty meal that can be made fairly quickly, and it is low in calories. The udon noodles are the best part of the soup; thick and hearty, they really make the meal. The miso paste smells savory and gives the soup its distinctive flavor. But the packet of dried "vegetables" is not very pleasant. Even when rehydrated, they retain their cube-like shape and must be stabbed apart with a spoon. Mixed into the vegetable block are a few cubes of painfully gritty tofu. Actually, the chalky white substance hardly bears any resemblance to tofu; it's almost like the marshmallows in Lucky Charms cereal.<br /><br />My other qualm about the soup, which lowers its rating, is the extensive and unnecessary cooking instructions. In lieu of following the directions, I always placed all the ingredients in the bowl in which they came, then added a cup of boiling water. Then, I let the bowl sit for about 5 minutes and stirred it.<br /><br />Overall, I do not regret purchasing this soup, but I won't be buying another case.

review/summary: Tasty Udon--Weak Miso (how to fix)
review/text: I love these noodles. I think they make a really fast, filling lunch and they are delicious. However, the miso noodles seemed a bit weak to me. But I put in a tsp of soy sauce and it fixed that issue. (I guess they want to hold down on the sodium and I get that.)<br /><br />To make these noodles, you refresh them in hot water, then microwave a freeze dried cube of scallions, seaweed and soup base, along with a packet of white miso (shiro miso) and some water (after you've drained the hot water used to refresh the udon.) That's it. Takes about 2 minutes total. If you have no restrictions on salt, save a packet of soy sauce from Chinese takeout and you can doll up these noodles to suit your taste.<br /><br />I like the texture. They are slurpy and chewy-good. I never even leave a drop of the soup behind.

It comes packaged with care, nicely and neatly presented (Makes you feel like your having a real treat) even has a lid to conserve leftovers. The bowls and lids are not plastic and are biodegradable. (STURDY ! I have even re-used them to store food and pack snacks.)<br /><br />Apart from the Miso, I also recommend the Teriyaki Noodle bowl by Annie Chun's. It is a real filling meal, and I add quickly stir fried veggies and a few ounces of meat and LOVE IT.

review/summary: Good instant lunch
review/text: Bought mine at Trader Joe's - much cheaper there, and this was my first Annie Chun product.<br /><br />Why are people comparing this to a restaurant? This is an *instant* noodle bowl! That said, the noodles actually came out better than some normal cooked udon I've had! I skipped the direction step that said to rinse the noodles first and just dumped the packed into the bowl, added water till the water line, and microwaved it for 90mins as indicated. Everything turn out great except for the tofu after stirring the noodle a few times before consuming; the tofu remained hard. Next time I'll add some real tofu.<br /><br />A couple complaints: The bowl gets really hot after it's microwaved. Yes, of course it should get hot but I'm comparing this to other instant microwavable meals. This was much hotter and I had to get a plate to place the bowl onto to carry it. Be warned! Also, it has way too much scallions. It would have been better if the vegetable pack was not a solid cube but sprinkle-able like other products. One could then adjust accordingly for taste.

review/summary: Surprsingly good
review/text: I've been keeping an eye out for different lunchtime food-type items I can bring to work and make with little fuss (aka, water and a microwave is about all I have access to). I really wasn't sure what to expect with this. I didn't know if it would be like the ramen noodles that college students survive on or if it might actually be a passable lunch. Luckily, it turns out to be far better than a "passable" lunch and it's a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Now, there are a good numbers of steps to prep it, but nothing you can't handle as long as you have access to water, a sink and a microwave. Don't need a measuring cup, I just use the fill line on the included bowl (another bonus, as I didn't have to scramble to find a microwave-safe bowl). It cooks up faster than I expected, which was nice not having to wait longer after all the other steps. The amount of food doesn't look like much at first, but after it's done, it's rather substantial. I had plenty to eat and it wasn't too salty like some miso soups tend to be. The noodles helped absorb some of that, I think. My only gripe, and it's relatively minor, were the "onions" that were included in the mix. They turned out rather soggy and limp to such an extent I don't think they could be classified as onions anymore. Maybe more like, "Clear, pliant tasteless "O"s. But other than that, it was quite enjoyable. I would buy this again, and I'd like to see what other flavors are available.

But if you can find real miso paste in your area, it is far more econimical to buy noodles, paste, tofu, and whatever veggies you like to put in it.

Available in something like a dozen different varieties, try them all and then subscribe to your favorites in order to get the lowest price.<br /><br />Note: The seasoning comes in a sealed pouch so if you tend to prefer yours less salty or less strong in taste, don't use it all to start.  You can always add more in later.<br /><br />Note: Since the bowl is made partially from cornstarch, it will biodegrade completely so toss it in the trash when you're done without feeling guilty.  (For this reason you should NOT attempt to reuse this bowl like you may have done with other brand instant noodle meals that came in plastic bowls.)

review/summary: My favorite of the soups
review/text: I hate been eating these bowls for YEARS.  This is NOT restaurant quality miso soup, the tofu is pathetic.  The flavor however is good (weaker) and the noodles are AMAZING.  Honestly so good.  So crazy good!  You don't need to do any of that rinse noodle stuff unless you want to (I stopped a long time ago).  I do no special ordering of my packets, just dump and delicious every time.  Amazon however needs to work on their prices, their prices are cheaper than most supermarkets, but if you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they sell them for 1.99 a bowl.

review/summary: Just add soy sauce!!!!
review/text: I read these reviews before eating this product and agreed it was bland. Then I added just a splash of low sodium soy sauce, and it was SO MUCH BETTER (for both the Udon and the Miso). If you were to eat noodles at a Japanese restaurant, there would be soy sauce on the table for this purpose anyway.

review/summary: So-so miso soup
review/text: Bought this from a warehouse store. I have had many miso soups at different Japanese restaurants. This one taste nowhere near a decent miso soup. It's a little sour, and don't have enough flavor.<br /><br />But it is very convenient. Perhaps there's something I can add to it to give it more flavor.

review/summary: All in all.. not bad
review/text: Went to the store to try any "Annie Chun" product I could find, and this happened to be the kind there.<br /><br />My first impression was "what the hell is that brick of dehydrated crap?". I'm referring to the veges they put in there.. they looked awful.<br /><br />I made the soup by putting the veges/sauce in the bowl, noodles over it, and then poured the boiling water over it. I was instantly impressed. The vegetables actually looked like veges instead of "vegetable flakes". The noodles were very thick and tasty. The sauce was pretty spot-on for miso. All in all, a very good product for the price and ease of making. I was quite hungry when I ate it, and it definitely took away the bite. I wouldn't say it's a 'filling' lunch, but this along with some veges/meat mixed in or maybe a side salad or something would be perfect.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 instead of 5 because I felt like the broth could've been a little bolder in flavor. Don't get me wrong, though, I'm definitely going to be ordering some Annie Chun products off of here now (probably start with Pho and Kimchi)

review/summary: Disappointed :  (
review/text: My first experience with Annie Chun's Noodle Bowls was the Kimchi.  It is awesome. I highly recommend that one. Recently Annie Chun products were on sale so I bought the Miso as Amazon was out of Kimchi.  I love Miso so I figured it would be as good as the Kimchi only not spicy.  Wrong.  I've had Kikkoman instant miso soup before and it has a better miso flavor. And I ate it plain.  I added spinach, tofu and a a touch of sliced mushrooms to Annie's and it still was just ok. It does have the noodles though--they're fun.  But my opinion is that if you like miso you will find this lacking.  I will not be purchasing this one again.

review/summary: Much better than ramen
review/text: There are a few staples for most office worker, and some sort of easy to heat soup is one of them. Unfortunately, most soup cups are pretty poor; either terrible for you or they taste like paste. Annie Chun's is an exception. The noodles are great by comparison to Ramen noodles. They have a nicer consistency and flavor, and are thicker by comparison. Another plus is that the soup doesn't contain nearly as much sodium as Ramen, meaning it is quite a bit healthier.<br /><br />The miso soup variety is my wife's favorite. I enjoy it as well, but not as much as the not-and-sour variety.

review/text: I've had miso soups at various restaurants and this is actually really good.  I love the fact they are environmentally concerned with their products.  I'll buy their products just knowing they care so much about how much we have to throw away, so it's biodegradable.  Only thing I'm not crazy about is the noodles, I would have preferred a thinner noodle, only because it's so bulky, and not really typical of Asian dish.

review/summary: Quick and tasty
review/text: This is the only soup that I've been eating for over a year and haven't been sick of yet. I really like bringing these to the office since they provide a very convenient lunch and they aren't as bad for your health as the other brands of soups to go. It's true that they are a little salty but it's not to a point where it's unbearable.<br />The reason why the dried tofu sometimes do not reconstitute well is because they did not get hot/heated enough. I always microwave my soup half a minute longer than what the directions on the package says so that the tofu can become soft (the way that they should in a soup).<br />My vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends really enjoy this soup as well as an extremely picky co-worker who I introduced this product to. Whenever they come over to my place and they get hungry, they'll ask for this soup when they see it in the pantry.<br />The only thing I wish is that the size could be bigger - it's a good light lunch so I have to find something else to eat to be completely full.

review/summary: Annie Chun's Test
review/text: I wanted to try out Annie Chun's soup after seeing it so much at friends houses and in the stores.  So I decided upon shopping one day to pick up a bowl of their Miso Soup.  Overall I find the soup quite bland and the noodles quite nicely cooked in the end but quite rubbery.  Following the directions you loosen up the noodles with a cup of hot water, and the only downside is they tend to break up into pieces and tear apart instead of loosening up.  As far as the broth goes, surprisingly it was nice but it tastes and smells much like cheaper brands.<br /><br />Overall My Scales<br />Taste: 4/10<br />Texture: 3/10<br />Smell: 2/10 (Virtually no aroma)<br />Overall Pleasure Score: 5/10

review/summary: Good for a microwave meal, but not great for miso soup
review/text: If you're a miso aficionado, this might not be the product for you.  The broth is pretty thin, not too flavorful, and the tofu is sparse (my bowl had only 2 small cubes).  The addition of the udon noodles is the soup's saving grace---it makes it a half-way decent meal.  If you're looking for a good soup, this is a good choice; if you're looking for a good *miso* soup, I'd suggest trying elsewhere.

review/summary: Bland, bland, bland
review/text: Just tried the miso soup for my lunch at work.<br /><br />Packaging: It was nice that there wasn't any plastic wrap. The bowl shape was a little awkward to hold.<br /><br />Preparation: The instructions seemed a little more elaborate than what is probably necessary. The one problem I had was that since I don't have a measuring cup with me at work (who does?) I had to estimate how much water to put in; I filled up to the line at the top of the bowl which I don't think was there for that purpose. Would have been nice if they had just marked the fill line on the side of the bowl. I think I put too much because the soup was barely hot after heating for the indicated ninety seconds.<br /><br />Ingredients: Indicating that it contains tofu is a little disingenuous; mine only had two pieces of tofu and one was half-sized. There were a lot of noodles. Too many noodles really. There weren't enough leafy veggies; mostly the scallions. The ingredients themselves seemed to be fresh and quality though.<br /><br />Taste: So very very bland. Just...amazingly bland. The over-abundance of bland completely tasteless noodles seemed like the main culprit. The only flavor besides bland noodles was scallions. I felt like I was eating scallion noodle water. I kind of feel sick now; there's a lump of oniony noodles just sitting in my stomach. In fact I'm contemplating running out on my break to buy something else just to get the taste out of my mouth...<br /><br />Over all I would rate this item pretty poorly. While the packaging is okay, the preparation isn't terrible, and the ingredients themselves seemed fresh, the overall taste and amount of each ingredient was absolutely awful. I would not recommend this to anyone. I have a package of the udon to try and I'm not looking forward to it...

review/text: I don't understand these good reviews. (Its like these reviewers never had real miso soup before.) I had the opposite feeling about this product. I followed the instructions closely and it had all the ingredients of miso soup, but it still didn't taste like miso soup! It looked like it (minus the dried tofu) but it tasted like nasty water. As I was drinking it, I kept wondering "why am I eating this? Why am I filling myself with this? I shouldn't be putting junk down my stomach." I should have punched myself for feeling obligated to finish it all. Fortunately, I ended up dumping it down the drain.<br /><br />If you want real miso soup, go to a Japanese restaurant. If you want something that doesn't taste like miso and is watered down, buy this product.

I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local  Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup. The box contains 4 packets, each packet yield  2 cups soup, so it produces 8 cups soup for just about $5 with great miso taste. Even Amazon cannot beat that deal.

review/summary: Bargain priced. More floral than fruity in taste
review/text: Davidson's Raspberry Essence tea is attractively priced at under $12 a pound (July '10). This is a whole leaf black tea, not the finely chopped leaves you sometimes find in bargain-basement teas. Added to the tea are dried mallow flower petals, which are an attractive purple/blue color. The tea is organically grown.<br /><br />This is a distinctly floral tea (again, think mallow flowers) without any hints at all of fruit or raspberry to my taste buds. If you are seeking a raspberry flavor, I recommend either Celestial Seasonings Raspberry or Bigelow Red Raspberry, both herbal teas with bright, fruity flavors.<br /><br />Water above 195 degrees and steeping longer than 3-4 minutes brings out more tannins than I like when drinking without sweetener or milk. I suggest letting your water cool a minute or so after it reaches the boiling point before adding to the tea.<br /><br />Should you buy this tea? If you like floral teas (Jasmine or Lavender, for example), try it since the price is right! If you want a raspberry taste, I recommend looking elsewhere. The "Raspberry Essence" description does not match the flavor - and the word "raspberry" does not appear in the list of ingredients. I would not have purchased this tea if I had understood the floral dominance, but that may be what you want. I hope that my information helps you in your purchasing decision.

To me it is similar to a Rose tea that I have. It is a nice tea, a little too flowery for me, but just an ok taste. I just ordered the strawberry because it had good reviews so we will see. I will mix this tea with others I have so it is not a total loss. I am very happy with the quality of Davidson teas as well as the quantity you get for your money. Spring Fruit and Flowers in my favorite so far. So, if you are looking for a fruity tea go with that one. The only thing it is caffeine free.

review/summary: Sweet, floral taste but......where's the raspberry?
review/text: A long-time summer favorite is a tall glass of raspberry iced tea.  When I saw the Raspbery Essense Tea by Davidson's and also saw it was made with black tea, not the herbal stuff, I thought I'd try it.  When the bag was opened I did not smell any raspberry at all, it was more like a very sweet flowery air freshener.  I checked the label again to make sure I had not ordered the wrong stuff, but it said Raspberry Essence.<br /><br />Ok, sometimes things do smell differently than they taste.  I added the loose tea to a tea ball and threw a couple of large family size tea bags into the sun tea jar with it, added filtered water, and waited 5 hours.  The result was a very floral tea that had no raspberry flavor that I could detect.  The tea isn't really bad, it just doesn't taste like raspberry tea.  The floral flavor is quite strong and nearly over-powers the black tea, even extra black tea added to the mix.<br /><br />I may use it a few more times for something "different" but it just isn't what I expected or wanted.  Maybe this winter it can be made hot with honey to take care of a scratchy throat.

review/summary: Unflavored black tea is a better pick than this raspberry blend
review/text: I'm a big fan of English breakfast teas, and an even bigger fan of fruit teas, so I thought this would a perfect blend to try.<br /><br />This tea did not blow me away.  Actually, it didn't even pleasantly surprise.  The raspberry flavor tastes almost artificial, and the black tea simply sits next to the raspberry flavor because they are stuck together by the tea's name.  They do not dance together, or do anything special to make my taste buds jump out of their place, as many other teas have done in the past.<br /><br />I'll drink this tea for now, since I ordered a whole pound of it, and the flavor does not offend.  However, I don't think I'll be ordering it again in the future.

I make it with an iced tea maker with 1/2 cup of splenda and 1/2 cup of sugar and it's sooooo yummy!  Thank you, Davidson's!

review/summary: A Ball That Is Super
review/text: It's a rubber ball, and it's, uh, super.<br /><br />What kid doesn't enjoy a superball, right?  My son really digs this toy, especially in the elementary school gym after basketball practice when he can throw it as hard as he wants in any direction, and the ball literally just goes nuts.  This is a great environment for this toy...a racquetball court would be great, too...no, jai-alai would be the best!<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Yes, Dad likes playing with it, too.  Go figure.  My only complaint is that it's not that big, rather disappointingly small.  It's only a little bit bigger than the cheapo superballs you get out of the grocery store coin machines.  It's a little bit smaller than a squash ball, definitely smaller than a racquetball.  My adult take on this toy is that one the size of a racquetball, or just slightly smaller than a baseball would be the best.  The downside of this is, and I can see the Wham-O liability lawyers toiling over the risk analysis, is that given this ball's density, a bigger ball would be a lot more massive, heavy, and could do some real damage to property and person if either were to be, ah, forcefully contacted.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a classic toy, as basic as you can get, and it does not disappoint.  Me, I'd like to see it offered in a larger size, but I understand why that's probably not going to happen.

review/text: I bought these for my kids. They love them, having never before experienced the fun of a Super Ball.<br />Wham-O has made the balls somewhat smaller than when I was a kid in the late 1960's. This doesn't affect the fun, but I do think they may have bounce more/longer when they were bigger, way back when.<br />They are totally cool. A classic toy every kid should enjoy. The shipping was quick and the packaging was adequate. Buy with confidence.

review/summary: SuperBall - sharing the fun with my son
review/text: When I was 10, back in the late 60's, one of my prized possessions was my SuperBall.  So when viewing an episode of 'George Lopez', the one where he gets his son a SuperBall - I told my own son about mine.  And of course he wanted one!  So I looked it up, found it on Amazon, and bought one.  We were not disappointed.  I don't know if it is exactly the same as the ball I had owned, but my son really enjoys it.  He and his friends have spent many hours bouncing it over our house (a 2 story)!  For the low price, it certainly was well worth it!

review/summary: Superior quality food -
review/text: After many fits and starts, I 've totally switched my two Flat coated Retrievers to Orijen.  Fantastic quality food and although price per pound is higher in reality w/o the cereal and other fillers of so many other dog foods, its actually only nominally more expensive.  I weaned my K-9s (ages 2 and 6) off other commercial foods and  have found their stools now on 100% Orijen are  normal, not  odorous (during the transition there is some  how do we say "stink" as this food contains  beneficial probiotics that initially are  dealing with  the  grain based old  foods in the K-9s digestive tract).  Also my k-9s  sleep inside at night and travel quite bit with me to training and searches - nothing worse than a dog  flatulance and  there is none and I mean none of that with this food  Yeah!  My K-9s are my Search and Rescue partners and this has given them  excellent stamina,  better coats and they both  relish  it.  I'm using New Zealand dried lamb  bits for training and reward treats but occasionnally  use just a few  Orijen  kibbles instead and you would think I was serving them  prime rib.  Wish I could find a local vendor in RI - shipping is a little steep but many of the vendors will offer you a  significant discount on the second order so I order two bags at a time and  change-up the flavors  from time to time so the  K-9s don't get jaded.  Can't say enough how pleased I am with food.

More importantly, her poop is GREAT on this kibble. Finally, it's easy to pick up! This food is a godsend.<br /><br />We've previously tried Innova EVO, California Natural Lamb and Rice Puppy and Adult, and Canidae All Life Stages. Innova EVO gave her the runs, but she was a new puppy. (The pet food store said EVO was rich enough for puppies. My vet disagreed.) California Natural seemed better, but her poop was always so soft that it was messy to pick up, and she never really liked it. She liked the taste of Canidae better - so much so that she would pick it out when I mixed it with the Lamb and Rice. However, her poop didn't really improve until we shifted to Orijen.<br /><br />Magic. This stuff is magic, I say. Besides being the magic food for my dog, it's also made in Canada with almost all Canadian ingredients. From what I've read, they get rice from California and Lamb from New Zealand, but otherwise -- everything comes from farms in and around Alberta. No food recalls on this brand!<br /><br />One word of advice: like with all good dog foods, it's best to keep the bag tightly closed. It goes stale.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that we like to roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage; (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product; and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises.  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog or cat food anywhere.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with nothing but the highest quality ingredients.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food out there.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product (the whole list is good, but I have to stop somewhere so this review doesn't get too long):  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: Incredible, Incredible Food!!
review/text: My pup (3 year old maltese) has a serious allergy to grain and a generally screwed up digestive system. The first year of his life was sort of trial and error when it comes to the right kind of dog food for him and a lot of long nights with upset stomachs. Eukanuba (which can barely be called dog 'food') nearly killed him and he ended up having to get fluids injected because of how dehydrated he got on it.  Hundreds of dollars to the vet later, we did research on dog food and the common grain allergy. We have tried all of the good grain-free brands, like Evo, Wellness, Merrick, etc. Orijen has been the best of the bunch.<br /><br />If you are worried about your dog having too much protein, I haven't really had a problem at all despite my little dog. He has been on Orijen for over two years and he is pretty much all lean muscle (all 13lbs of him!), despite being mostly sedentary outside of daily walks. He has clear, tear-stain free eyes, a shiny coat, and has never been sick since starting on this food. I can't help but think his excellent quality food has been keeping him healthy!<br /><br />Orijen is expensive, but worth it!

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: As for the quality of this food if you're unfamiliar with holistic foods, this stuff is top quality.  It has many forms of meat, no grains whatsoever, and no controversial ingredients, etc...  You know the drill, a top quality food that is unavailable in grocery stores.  Actually one of the best on the market amongst hundreds of different kinds.<br /><br />This stuff is pricey but your dog will eat less so it sort of offsets the price a bit.  With regular food your dog is eating corn, potato peelings, rotten rice, and animal guts and blood swept off the floor of the slaughter house.  That food is so low in nutrients your dog must eat tons of it and poop out all the poison that shouldn't be in the food.  With a great food like Orijen your dog will eat less, absorb most of it, and have fewer and more solid stools.<br /><br />There are a few people who are a little weary of Canidae.  Canidae now makes a grain free formula which is excellent.  It's almost as good as Orijen and cheaper as well.  If you want one of the better foods on the market and a good price, Canidae grain free is your ticket.  But if you absolutely want the Lamborghini of dog foods then Orijen is your buy, although Canidae is a Porsche and still pretty darn good.

review/summary: MAGIC FOOD!
review/text: Our five year old Thai Ridgeback was getting a little chunky after a particularly snowy winter. The owner of our dog walking service mentioned Orijen food as a way to slim her down.  We had been feeding her Science Diet, 1/2 sensitive skin, 1/2 light food.  We always considered her to be reasonably healthy and active.  Twice before I had attempted to switch her to "fancier" holistic foods and both times she began losing hair.  I suspected lamb as the culprit but it could have been some other ingredient.  I have never reviewed anything before or felt passionate enough about a product to sing it's praises until now.<br /><br />The minute you open the bag you notice the food smells wonderful.  It looks high quality.  The dog LOVES it.  It's is excruciating to wait for that first bag that is mixed 50/50 to be finished so you can completely transition.  We knew right away that this was a good choice, but as time went on I was stunned at all the aspects of her health that improved.  1) Ashy-ness that she had developed on her elbows went completely away. 2) Her coat grew noticeably thicker and shinier over several months. 3) &lt;Gross-out Alert> Her stool is firm and smaller; she stopped farting, and no longer experiences anal sack leakage.  4) After a year of feeding her this food she is now visibly leaner and looks awesome for 6 years old.  This is the best thing we could have done.<br /><br />Now the economy of it.  Science Diet is $45 bucks for 30lbs.  This stuff is $65.  BUT, since she digests more of the product we literally feed her 2/3's the amount we used to, and she seems more satisfied, doesn't stand by her bowl and beg for more.  It's basically a wash on price!<br /><br />In response to the reviews that claim this food is dangerous, I have a hard time believing those aren't planted by a rival company.  She just got a full check up and three year rabies shot at our vet.  There isn't anything wrong with her liver.  The vet said they were not familiar with Orijen yet, but they agree that she is noticeably healthier and the higher protein content is perfectly safe.  It's about what is not in this food that makes the difference for me.  No pesticides, no cheap stabilizers, no filler grains, no ground up bones and connective tissues.  I'm not a vet or nutritionist but I am a first-hand witness to the positive effects of this wonderful food.  Thank you Orijen!!!

review/text: Our dog was having trouble with grocery store purchased dog food. She would eat it and a half hour to four hours later she would throw it up. This cycle went on for months. We took her to the vet and they ran all sorts of tests and everything came back negative. So the vet's solution was to put her on a stomach medicine...for the rest of her life!<br /><br />Not wanting to put her on drugs for the rest of her life (she's only 2 yrs old) I started doing some research and discovered that many dogs have a food allergy to grains, especially corn and corn by-products which are in just about every commercial dog food.<br /><br />Then I stumbled onto grain-free dog foods and this led me to Orijen. All I can say is "Wow!"<br />I tried a small sample bag first (purchased at a store an hour away) and she loved it. Best of all, it stayed down.<br />Then I bought a larger bag. Yes, it's more expensive but she eats a smaller quantity so overall each month I'm not spending any more money on dog food.<br /><br />In the 6 months we have had her on Orijen Adult Formula, she has not thrown up her food at all. Not once! (She also likes the Orijen fish formula too)  I find that simply amazing. Her coat is shiny and glossy now and she clearly feels good!<br /><br />The only negative for us is that it is not available locally and I have to drive an hour to a larger city to buy it. Occasionally I have ordered it online. But we have a new pet store opening up here soon that will be carrying it so that will resolve our "where to buy it" issue.<br /><br />I strongly recommend that VETS also suggest a grain-free diet for dogs having stomach/digestive issues instead of just automatically reaching for the Rx pad. My two cents.

review/summary: Great stuff
review/text: My terrier mix is a very picky eater, so we have tried almost every one of the higher quality dog foods out there and my dog likes this best. This is also one of the best made dog foods in my opinion. 70% meat and zero grain. The only thing was figuring out the correct amount to feed her each day. As this is a very high protein food(42%), the portions we feed are half of "normal" protein food. My dog is very active, so she has no problem burning off the high calorie count of this food(almost 500 cal per cup). So even though the cost per bag is high, it is really no more expensive than "normal" brands in the long run. Watch for weight gain in larger dogs, my friend tried this stuff with his big Lab mix and he put on to much weight. My only complaint would be that my dogs coat doesnt seem to shine like it did with some other brands. I now top this food off with a squirt of salmon oil and her coat really shines. The best thing about this food is that my dog just loves the taste. I would recommend trying.

review/summary: Be Careful
review/text: This food has EXTREMELY high levels of protein. Not all dogs need a high protein diet, and in fact for some it can be quite dangerous. While my dog was on Orijen, my vet discovered that he had elevated liver enzymes. Many dog food health websites advocate high protein foods, but these can be very dangerous. Dogs that don't have a lot of energy and/or have little body fat (like sighthounds) do not need this much protein, and processing it can be very bad for their livers. This is a high quality food, I love that it is made by a small company in Canada, and many people have had great success with it. But know that it is NOT for every dog! Please be careful and keep in mind that more protein is not always better if you are considering this food!

review/text: The initial food of the cost maybe seem steep, but the ingridients are superior in quality, I like the fact that its made by a small company and I hope they wont be involved in any recalls. The food is very rich, so you're feeding less then cheap grocery brands full of fillers, meat feeds muscle not corn, my dog has several allergies and for a long time I couldnt settle on a food that didnt upset his stomach or gave him gives, bad breath, etc. He gobbles this up every evening and thinks its a treat.<br />Well worth the money spent.

review/summary: I really wanted to love this for our boy
review/text: We were unhappy with the food our breeder used. High percentage of corn. After reading lots of labels, in theory this seemed to be just what we were looking for. We went through a careful, slow transition, but this turned out to be way too harsh on our Havanese's GI tract. He ate it just fine, but we would see a progression to larger and more greenish stool, then loss of form until he had a true liquid event. That was the end of that!<br /><br />For anyone with a toy breed, if you would like another option, we eventually transitioned over to Wellness Small Breed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AN2PUE">Wellness Super5Mix Adult Health Small Breed Formula Dry Dog Food</a> . This turned out to be both a food he loves and the transition was effortless. He is behaving very puppy-like @ 3 years old which I feel is a good thing. The Wellness  food brand was never part of the 2007 animal food recall list for melamine (rice gluten) and is corn, soy and wheat free.

review/text: This is a super premium dog food, but if you are a first time user, beware, it can cause stomach upset and diareah.  Add slowly to your dogs old food.  Orijen has a high protein level and if your dog is used to lots of carbs, too much Orijen initially will be hard on the dogs stomach.  Once you incorporate this food slowly into your dogs diet, it is a great food that will make your dog healthy and happy

review/summary: Awesome Food!
review/text: Ok, let me start this review by stating that NO DOG FOOD WILL WORK FOR EVERY DOG.<br /><br />We have been bouncing around from food to food since Canidae sold their product to Diamond Dog Food.  We have tried everything from Eukanaba to Merrick to Innova, and Orijen has given us the best results.  Orijen has an excellent breeders program, in which if you are accepted you receive your 7th bag of food free.  This is a huge savings and brings the cost of Orijen down to near what most foods sold at PetCo or similar companies cost.  Also, we were hesitant to try Orijen or any grain free food for that matter because of all the claims of kidney issues.  Do your research, don't take my word for it, but protein is broken down in the liver, not the kidney -- claims that it causes kidney failure are grossly inaccurate.  Dogs with existing kidney issues may have a harder time excreting broken down protein, but that would affect all dog foods.  Remember, if your dog is sick, your vet puts the dog on chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice (these foods are rich in protein).<br /><br />Another interesting point is, we have bulldogs that we show.  These dogs are particularly, let's say, "beefy".  We were worried that this food would slim them down too much and make them not look like a show standard, but it did not.  2 cups/day is perfect for them.  Remember calories are not an exact science and your dog will not absorb every calorie from any dog food (thus why they poop), so don't be worried if you have to feed more or less of any particular food.<br /><br />Do your research, you won't find a better food, made with better ingredients than Orijen for anywhere close to this price.  EVO is much more massively produced, and its meat ingredients are purchased, not raised by the company like Orijens.  Never preserved, never frozen, fresh meat is what Orijen is about.

review/summary: Gotta love this food
review/text: I started feeding my two dogs on this food a couple of weeks ago. I have a 4 year old havanese that is an extremely picky eater, and a six year old shepherd mix who has almost always been at least a few pounds overweight. I was giving them Eukanuba Naturals before this, which isn't cheap food. We have tried many different foods over the years for our havanese, and she barely eats any of them, always had to entice her, but she absolutely loves Orijen. For the first time ever she runs to the bowl and just gobbles it down. With our shepherd we have tried many different diet dog foods, and feeding her less and less, but no matter what we did she would never lose those few pounds, but after this short time on Orijen she has already lost 2 pounds. Orijen has much fewer carbs than the other foods out there, less than half the carbs of what we were feeding her, and carbs are empty calories for dogs. This food is great. My dogs absolutely love it, and I love what it is doing for them. And no gas!!

review/summary: Best Food Ever.
review/text: My 12 year old Golden was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  As far as cancer is concerned, it's one of the worst... prognosis is generally 4-6 weeks after diagnosis untreated, up to one year with chemo.  My husband and I decided we were not in a financial position to do chemo, especially to only buy our pooch one year, so I started researching alternative medicines.  One thing I read over and over was to switch to a grain-free diet.  Well, we had been feeding him decent food, but not grain-free.  So, I bought a bag of this.<br /><br />10 weeks later the tumors in his neck have shrunk without any medication, and you'd never know this dog has a death sentence.  He can digest it just fine, his coat looks great, he actually slimmed up a bit (which is great because he was a little chubby) and he just looks and feels fantastic.  I'm not saying this is a miracle cure-all and that the cancer won't get the best of him one day soon, but I am forever thankful to this company for making such high quality food that is making his time left easier and enjoyable.  Oh, and he LOVES this food.  Like, circles, cute noises, tail boogie-woogie, hopping etc.  It's almost like he's a puppy again. :D

review/summary: You get what you pay for: incredible ingredients but a little pricey.
review/text: The first time I read the ingredient list for this food I said: "Son of a... I WOULD EAT THIS!" No joke, there isn't a single ingredient name you won't recognize and there are no artificial preservatives (the food, in fact, contains ingredients that have never been frozen and so it is vacuum-sealed in the packaging--which incidentally makes the bag quite easy to carry). I have yet to meet a dog owner (in person!) who hasn't told me their dog eats this stuff like it's crack-cocaine!<br /><br />Since it is a little pricey (despite the fact that you actually have to feed your dog LESS food than any other brand with a high grain content--which is used as a filler in all your standard grocery-store dog foods because corn is so cheap), I do a half-and-half mix of Orijen with another incredible dry dog food called "Taste of the Wild".<br /><br />All I can say is that my Siberian Husky LOVES this food so much that when she's done she just sits there looking at me for a minute before letting out a very satisfying belch. I swear I laugh every time she does it. Finally, I can also say, and this is only anecdotal, but after I switched to this food (I was formerly feeding her Eukanuba) my dog's shedding decreased significantly. Husky's usually "blow their coat" once or twice a year with mild/standard shedding in-between; it was this mild/standard shedding that decreased.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone with a medium to large breed dog that has a high-energy level.<br /><br />(Edited for typos and some added content).

review/summary: Orijen and small dogs
review/text: As I write this my 17 lbs Bischon Poodle is in the vet hospital after liver shut down yesterday. Looking for the best food on the market for my dog I researched and read the rave reviews for Orijen all natural food. I decided to place my dog on it. She has been on it for a little over 3 months. She refused to eat the past couple of days. I took her to the vet. The high protein level in Orijen food had put my dog into liver shutdown. I fed her according to recommendations. Protein needed for a small dog is 10-13 % Orijen 39%. No where does Orijen put a warning on their food stating that it could be detrimental to small dogs. I would never recommend this product for a small dog. I would never use it for any dog of mine. The normal level of liver enzymes should have been 70-100. My dogs after being on Orijen for 3 months 750. The risks are too high think carefully and make sure you consult your vet. I would hate to see anyone go through what I've experienced with my dog.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: The best grain free dog food
review/text: Orijen makes by far the best dog food you can buy. It's expensive but well worth it, especially when you take into account how much you will save on vet bills and the great boost it will give to your dogs overall health and well being.. It is grain free which is very important as grain is not part of a dog's normal diet and besides mostly being filler, grains can cause allergies and other issues. My 5 year old German Shepherd is on Orijen Adult and has done incredibly well on it, stunning coat, great energy, consistently firm, and virtually odor-free, poops. I also have a large male Golden who is now 13 1/2 years old and doing fantastic. He at Orijen Senior until about 3 years ago when we switched him to Orijen Senior. Other than a little arthritis in his hips and knees (to be expected) he is perfectly healthy and his last blood panel came back incredibly good. My vet says we are doing all the right things (daily walks and exercise, filtered water, Orijen Senior food) especially since large Goldens typically only live to 10 or 11. When we are out walking quite often we meet much younger goldens (6 to 8 years) that look much older than he does. It really does show what a difference diet and exercise make both in humans and in our canine companions. We have a new puppy (that we adopted from the Best Friends Animal Society) and she is on a mix of Orijen Puppy and doing great. Highly recommend Orijen Adult, Senior and Puppy.<br /><br />Note:<br />Many years ago we fed our dogs Canidae because it was decent quality and we were financial limited. But, when the Canidae manufacturer suddenly changed their formula (added more grain and fillers) all of our dogs had bad reactions (diarrhea, vomiting, scratching, skin allergies etc). Numerous trips to the vet and lots of dollars for tests only to find out they were all having a reaction to the poor quality ingredients in their food. That was when I began researching dog food ingredients and decided to go grain-free with a company that only makes dog food. Could not be happier with my decision to spend more on Orijen. Very wise decision on my part, and my dogs are much healthy now than they have ever been.

review/text: I am not the review leaving type, but I do read them - therefore I must in good concience tell of my experience. This food is a life saver for my cocker. Our vet and the vet specialist suspected an allergy and he was on Hills ZD prescriptive food, the allergy manifested itself mainly with ear issues, not unusual in a Cocker but the ears went from normal difficult cocker ears to close to end disease ear canals with an ablation recommended. We did surgery to remove tumors in his ears, we tried expensive medication, he was still in pain.  Then, my vet ran out of the ZD. I looked around for another food and read about Orijen. We gave it a try, after two weeks the change was significant, his nose is no longer cracked and dry, his eyes no longer weep and his ears don't hurt him anymore!  They get better each day and I can only attribute it to this food. Try it, I am thrilled I did.

review/summary: Love it!!!  Shiney fur and no "dog" smell!
review/text: We switched our dogs to this food after reading about what is in grocery store brands.  I believe they were on Beneful. (garbage) The change was amazing! They have been on Orijens for around 3 yrs now and they are doing great!  We have a bassett mix, and elderly lab mix, and a beagle.  The changes in their fur were amazing! Their coats went from dull and dry to soft and shiney. We get comments all the time on how shiney and soft they are. Another nice effect is that since there is no corn in the food, our dogs do not smell at all anymore. Dogs cannot digest corn properly and thats why you get that "dorito" smell with the cheaper foods.<br /> Our older lab mix's arthritis improved drastically and he has such a spring in his step for an old guy (13yrs.) I honestly believe Orijens has added years to his life.  The beagle always had a touchy stomach too, and after the first 2 weeks or so he was doing better than ever on Orijens. They also all love it.  It is so worth the price to me as my dogs are healthier and happier.

review/text: I have tried out food from Iams which is pure garbage, to hills science diet, which was not bad, to wellness, which my dog didn't like at all as it was hard for him to break down.<br /><br />When i read about Orijen and just by looking at the ingredients, i knew this product had to be good. My dog loves it so much, that where before he would eat half off the daily dose needed with other products; with orijen, he eats all of his daily dose and begs for more. this food is trully a great product for him and i am glad that there are companies out there who actually care about animals and what they put in their stomachs and not just money oriented. Sure it is expensive, but in order to use expensive products, money has to be paid out and all companies are not going to be running a business for free. i believe that if you can afford to feed yourself good food, then the animals that live with you should also not be deprived from good food either.<br /><br />thank you Orijen - Great product and i would recommend it to anyone.

review/summary: Worth every penny
review/text: I have a 4 year old mini Doxie who was terribly picky about eating dog food, Heaven forbid. For the first 2 years of his life he would rather starve than eat so, of course, he ate mostly table scraps. Most of the scraps were a beef dish or raw hamburger. At about one year old he developed a nasty skin rash with lesions that flaked and the hair would fall out. A couple of Vets said it looked like Staph and we tried SEVERAL rounds of antibiotics and medicated shampoos. None of them worked. I finally got frustrated and bought a bag of Orijen adult formula and flatly refused to give anymore people food. Eventually he gave in and decided to try the Orijen. Within 3 weeks to a month his rash was totally gone, his loose stools firmed up and he has a healthy doggie appetite and diet. At his last checkup I told the Vet about Orijen and he was intrigued. Stated he had never heard of it but wrote the name down to look into it. If your dog has any health issues that are undiagnosed or seem untreatable, give Orijen a try.

Make sure to adjust the amount you feed according to the back of the bag as this will make your dog porky if you give it too much and do not have a very high activity level. Was very easy to switch her over. Mixed it in 20/80 with her old stuff and she picked out all the Orijen and ate it and left the old stuff on the first day. She was eating it regularly with no bad side affects from then on.

review/summary: Spent Months Looking For A Good Food
review/text: I have literally spent months looking for a good dog food. My dog, a border collie/ husky mix, seems to be allergic to everything I ever gave her. I went to every pet store and ordered every natural food I could find but nothing work. The poor thing had horrible gas and runny poop for months. Not to mention the non-stop chewing and itching.<br /><br />Anyway I finally found out about Orijen on a Border Collie website and I have to say this stuff is magic.<br /><br />Within two days my dog's stomach settled, her fur is coming back to life and she is bouncing around like a puppy again.<br /><br />The itching is still going on but far from what it was and from what I have hear it takes weeks for the allergens to completely leave a dogs system.<br /><br />I fully recommend this product!

review/summary: Feeding Costs and Guidelines
review/text: Orijen seems to be what experts want us to feed to our dogs.  It smells nasty so we keep it sealed and the dog loves it more than Newman's Own (N.O.) Organic dry (no bad smell, dog doesn't like it).  We've always mixed N.O. with some (decidedly stinky) wet food.  Anyway, I've read that some dogs have intestinal upset with the Orijen food due to high protein content.  Others quote the high price of the food.  I agreed, but changed my mind when I read the feeding guidelines.  Here is a big tip from the Orijen people. "We recommend that you feed twice daily. Simply divide the amount suggested on the feeding guide into two meals, spaced eight to twelve hours apart. You may need to adjust portions as you learn your dog's ideal daily "maintenance" amount, always keeping in mind that a lean dog is a healthy dog!<br /><br />TRANSITIONING FOODS<br />"Dogs are often fed the same food, which means a sudden food change makes it difficult for their digestive systems to adapt. That's why it's important to introduce the new food gradually. Going slowly will give your dog or cat time to adjust to their new food and will also reduce the chances of digestive upset.<br /><br />"Start by mixing 25% new food with 75% old food. Slowly change the proportions over the next three to five days by gradually increasing the amount of ORIJEN and decreasing the amount of old food. At the end of this transitioning process, you should be feeding 100% ORIJEN." ~Quoted from the website of the Orijen dog food.<br /><br />COST PER SERVING<br />We plan to continue the small amount of Orijen and see how our 30 pound Border mix rescue handles eating about 1/2 cup of food twice a day instead of the 1 and-a-half cups of N.O. that sits all day until she decides to eat it.  So far, the transition period is going very well.  She does a pretty nice job picking out the Orijen kibble and leaving the N.O..  So, for 1c. per day, if a 1/2 c. measure of kibble weighs approximately 1 oz on my non-scientific kitchen scale, then 30 pounds of food for 63 dollars is about 16 servings per pound or 480 servings per bag - which is 63/480... about 13 cents per serving @ 2 per day = 26 cents per day?  N.O. is (subscribe&save .11 cents per ounce, but my dog needs (but won't eat unless mixed with wet) needs 3 times the amount (1 and-a-half cups per serving which is 6 oz. on my kitchen scale "20-40 pound dog 1-1/3 to 2-1/4 cup) per serving or per day, I don't know, but we feed her 1.5 cups twice a day (6 oz. x .11 cents per oz.= 66 cents x 2 = $1.32 N.O. per day) is still more costly than Orijen at .26 cents per day. So for us, at least, the transition is cost-effective.<br /><br />Given that a half cup of food per serving is so little food, I'll probably supplement her meals with something else. Should I let go of the N.O. kibble just yet?

review/summary: worth every penny
review/text: I compete with my dogs in agility trials, and wanted to give my dogs every benefit that<br />I could to try to enhance their performance and quality of life. I tried the six year old on it first, he had always been fed very good foods and eats well on anything, so it didnt surprise me that he loved it.  After a few months, I have seen a positive change in his<br />overall attitude and energy levels.  His "summer" coat is still decent too. I recently switched my 10.5 year old to the same food. He is more fussy, but he liked it too.<br />The first week he was on it 100%, I noticed he seemed to act a bit younger.  I really feel<br />the higher levels of quality protein and fat,in addition to the lack of grain, have made a difference in my dogs happiness and energy levels.

review/summary: Best dog food out there!
review/text: If you are reading the ingredient list, then you will see that this is one of the best food out there to feed your dog. grain-free, tons of meat. My dog (a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel) loves it, and it has never upset her digestive system. but every dog is different... it's not the food's fault, it just some dogs are more sensitive. Her coat is super glossy and she's kept at ideal weight on this food. Couldn't ask for anything more!!!

review/summary: The Best
review/text: My wife and I are Lhasa Apso breeders. We switched to Orijen a few years back during that Chinese wheat gluten scare. Turned out to be an excellent decision. Our dogs love it and contrary to what someone said, there have been zero negative health issues. We've even got our Vet recommending it now. Yes it seems to be a bit expensive but you're not buying it quite as often because the dogs eat less. It's still not cheap but not as bad as you might think. Their largest bag lasts our 6 Lhasa's just about a month. I was glad when the Fish flavor came out a while back for a change of pace and recently have seen a beef flavor hitting the shelves that we haven't tried just yet. Very highly recommended!

review/summary: GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME TO SAMPLE
review/text: Orijen dry dog food is relatively new to me, (approx. 8 months) but not only does my German Shepherd love it..right out of the bag..but I always taste a sample myself! (Not something I would normally do with just any dog food). You'll find after opening the sturdy bag, the aroma of the Orijen dog food catches your sense of smell like a freshly brewed cup of coffee, or a piece of your favorite meat or fish.  I usually buy the blue bag of free-run chichen and fish product because I find it contains the most appropriate ingredients for my German Shepherd. When the box of food is delivered, she is immediately scratching the box to help me open it..she knows it's for her and can't wait to get her teeth into it. LORI, Phila.
