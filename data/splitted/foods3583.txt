review/summary: Get the non-plastic wrap version if possible - dries nice & hard like German salami
review/text: Delicious salami/summer sausage, BUT this packaging version requires refrigeration after exposing to air/opening. They sell same sausage in delicatessens, giftshops and probably direct, with a NON-plastic wrap and STRING so you can HANG it and let it HARDEN as long as you like. I let it get very hard and crunchy, like the great sausages I buy when in Germany. Great price here as 3-pack though.

review/summary: Very Fatty With Bone Chips
review/text: The flavoring in this was just not very good but tolerable. I ordered the 3 pack from Amazon so we had three to get through. We were really put off that it seemed like each slice we had was half fat. We ended up cooking it off before we ate it. There just is no excuse for it to be so full of grease. Also we were very turned off in the fact that we would occasionally hit a bone chip and one got stuck between two of my teeth and I thought there was a dental trip in my future but I was able to work it out.<br />We gave up on it and I would say they are careless in what they grind in the sausage. I really wanted to like this sausage but just couldn't get around all the issues with it. We will be going back to our old brand which is a little more expensive but I guess with sausage you get what you pay for.

review/text: These are similar to popchips. Bought a box at Walmart for 8cents a box less than subscribe and save here but if Walmart doesn't have them where you live then it is a bargain. I do prefer the popchips although they are about 10cents more per ounce. They have a more intense flavor. I also like the selection of flavors available for popchips. Still if you don't want to buy a large quantity then Kelloggs would be a good compromise and also sometimes the popchips I want from Amazon are not available so there is an alternative. Nutrition values are about the same....calories,fat etc.

review/text: Granted these are not the best tasting compared to lays sour cream and onion but for the amount of calories, they are pretty darn good. I am doing weight watchers points plus and for 27 of these chips it's only 3 points (I put them in baggies by 9 so I can add only 1 point to my lunch) They are not as greasy as potatoe chips, they are very light and crisp. When I crave chips I want something salty and crunchy that tastes good and these definitely pass the test. I gave them four stars because they are not as good as lays but you can't expect something healthy to be as delicious as the fattening version. Hope this helps :)

review/summary: Not the same but not bad at all...
review/text: Who doesn't like to snack on a chip?  I mean, seriously.  Even if you are the most health conscious of people and NEVER eat potato chips, you know you want one.  I personally LOVE all things sour cream and onion, have since I was a child.  When I saw these in the store the other day, while venturing off on a road trip with the family, I knew I needed them for the ride.  I have been eating healthier and so I haven't had a potato chip of any kind for about six months and I just needed to get that fix.  At only 110 calories for 27 chips, I was more than anxious to pop this box open.  Despite feeling like a box of air, I was pleasantly surprised to find these little guys pretty dense and filling.  27 crackers actually fills me up for a snack and doesn't leave me starving for more.  Taste-wise, these guys aren't too bad.  They are a little strong and actually taste more like Cheddar Chive chips than actual Sour Cream and Onion.  That being said, I can't complain a whole lot.  They aren't greasy, they aren't heavy and they are filling.

review/text: For those who only think of Kellogg's as a cereal company, you're in for a treat if you buy these chips.  They are everything the company claims for them as they are crunchy, tasty, have fiber and are low in calories.  My only complaint would be the price as there are only about 3 1/2 servings per box (the box looks as if it would contain a lot more)and costs $3.00.  We finished a box in one day and I'm almost afraid to buy more as my food budget would really suffer.

review/text: These are pretty good.  They're not as crispy as potato chips, but they have a decent sour cream and onion taste.  Like someone else mentioned, these are VERY similar to Popchips, just a bit thinner.<br /><br />The calorie count is low: 27 chips = 110 calories, and there are only about 3 servings per box, so even if you can't stop yourself, you're looking at only 330 calories or so for the entire box.  Obviously, you wouldn't want to down an entire box every day, but if you do, the damage isn't *too* bad.<br /><br />I'll probably purchase them once in awhile as an alternative snack.

review/text: I'm always looking for savory snacks. I gave these a try and threw away the rest of the box. They taste like fake potatoes with a faraway taste of sour cream and onion. I can't believe the positive reviews I've seen here. They must be from people who have given up on real food or have been dieting for so long that they've forgotten the taste of real sour cream and onions. Good luck and happy pound losing. I'll stick to something more sensible, like Town House Flatbread Crisps with Italian Herbs. Serving size - 6 little crackers - is 16 grams for a total of 70 calories per serving, vs. Special K's 55 calories. 20 more calories for a much better tasting snack with similar nutritional values.

review/summary: Came with an unexpected surprise!
review/text: I ordered this Staghorn Fern for my brother's birthday. It arrived at his Brooklyn apartment and he hung it in his bathroom. The next day he walks into his bathroom...to find a little lizard!!....and the next day....another lizard!!!<br />He had nowhere to keep them and they "escaped". He was going to buy a little tank to keep them in, but they disappeared from their temporary housing.<br />I let the company know to do a better check of the ferns before they are sent...this was definitely not what I expected. (I had a good laugh about it - but I don't think my brother did!)

review/text: I ordered this as a gift for my sister.  We had seen this plant on a recent visit to a botanical garden and she was fascinated by it.  I ordered it last weekend and the plant arrived within a few days.  It is bigger than expected and even had a couple "babies" attached.  The plant is now proudly displayed at my sister's house.  Great experience!  Would purchase from this vendor again.

review/text: We ordered this Staghorn Fern from Hirt's Garden to replace one that could not take the heat, here in the desert.  I was expecting it to arrive smaller and in pretty tired shape.  I was shocked when I opened the box and found a large, lush plant, it extremely good condition.  We gave it a bit of water and kept it indoors for a few days before placing it outside in our patio garden.  We have a misting system out there, and the Staghorn loves it.  We are very pleased with our purchase.

review/summary: Wrong order
review/text: So I ordered 8 jars of Pataks Tikka PASTE, the first batch I received were 4 jars of chicken Tikka Marinade, I decided not to return because it was simply too much trouble and the second batch might be correct, well the other 4 jars arrived yesterday, I pulled out the first jar, it was Tikka PASTE, I was thinking hooray they got it right, then the other 3 were Tikka Marinade. I purchased Tikka PASTE so I can make currys. I use Pataks curry paste all the time, I'm originally from the UK where Pataks is very popular to use to make currys. I have ordered curry paste before off Amazon, I will definitely not use these again. If you get Tikka marinade, it's for marinating chicken and putting it on the grill. A paste you can use to make a curry.

During the spring bloom and fall<br />harvest time, we need to give them allergy meds.  I thought these might help.<br /><br />They didn't.<br /><br />Neither cat will touch them, even without a pill.  I did try the pockets without medicine in them<br />first, so they would not be suspicious the next time. They both turned up their noses and walked away.<br />These are cats who will knock you down to get chicken!<br /><br />So, can't recommend them for cats in general, but I am sure they'd work well for dogs.

Although they're made for cats, my dog loves them (particularly the chicken flavor, but also the salmon flavor), and since she is so small (4.5 lb), the cat-sized pockets are a better fit for her than the dog-sized pockets.

review/text: I have a cat who refused to take any pill at anytime.  He ran, bit, scratched and if you could get the pill into his mouth he would spit it out or throw it up.  He was diagnosed with a heart condition and must take pills twice a day.  I told the vet that this would be imposible for me to do that.  My vet sugested Pill Pockets for cats.  My cat is now excited when he gets his pills and actually requests them whenever I go in the cabinet where I keep his pills.  If it weren't for Pill Pockets he would either be dead or very sick by now.  Thank you.

If I ran canned tuna in my food processor for a minute, I could not get the pieces any smaller.  I call them pieces, but it really is a tuna puree.  The taste resembles tuna, but honestly after a dozen cans or of varying uses, the thought of eating this stuff was so revolting that I put the unopened cans in the garbage.

review/text: The case of 24 was delivered today completely intact. Cardboard base, 24 cans lined up perfectly like little soldiers with plastic wrap encasing the entire thing. And that was placed inside a larger shipping carton with a pile of those sealed air packets so it wouldn't jostle around during transit. I opened the shrink-wrapped plastic to put the cans in my pantry and every single one of them has a large dent. Not a small ding as if they got clunked together. Large dents - at least one per can; some more than one. Some are in the body of the can but most are along the top rim which is going to make opening these things a pain in the neck. There isn't a can opener born that likes dented rims. Skip this one.

review/summary: Delicious, Inexpensive Hydration with Minimal Calories
review/text: Crystal Light is a great way to cut calories from your diet, while saving a remarkable amount of money.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  CUT CALORIES:<br />  - Overall, males consume an average of 178 kcal from sugar drinks on any given day, while females  consume 103 kcal, as reported by the CDC study(Center for Disease Control). You can drink your fill of Crystal Light every day and consume less than one tenth of the calories you would drinking either juice or soda, making it probably the most effective way ever to cut calories. If you drank about 2 liters of Crystal Light every day, according to the nutrition information, you would consume 5 calories for every serving of 8 fl. oz. Since there are about 33.814 fl oz./liter, 2 liters would net you 42 calories (the way I mix it with extra flavor would probably be about 55 or 60 calories a day), which is still great when you consider that the average man just cut more than 100 calories a day from his diet. Sugar drinks represent at least 6% of the average Americans caloric intake. To put it in perspective, the average 2 liter bottle of soda is between 800 and 1000 calories (kcal). Cutting that alone will result in noticeable weight loss over the long-term.<br /><br />  SAVE MONEY:<br />  - Volume wise, you will save an exorbitant amount of money switching to Crystal Light from either soda  or juice. Just replacing soda at anywhere between $.49 and $1.00/liter (if you're buying in bulk, not including purchases from vending machines, restaurants, etc...) with Crystal Light at a max of $.30/liter (depends how you mix the beverage; i like a lot of flavor) will save the average person in the U.S. (consumed 219 liters of soft drinks/yr (2002)) from $41.61 and $218.70. That isn't even including the money that would be saved by also removing other sugar-based beverages from the diet, like juice or other fruit drinks. Don't even get me started on beer, wine, wine coolers, etc... and the cost difference.<br /><br />  TASTES DELICIOUS:<br />  - Ok, I'm not going to lie. Some of the flavors are delicious, some are NOT:<br />  - Fruit Punch [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9ZQ">Crystal Light Fruit Punch Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.04-  Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Cranberry Apple [*delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9YM">Crystal Light Natural Cranberry Apple Drink Mix (12-Quart) 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Strawberry Kiwi [*extra delicious] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9W4">Crystal Light  Strawberry Kiwi Drink Mix (12-Quart), 2.3-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 4)</a><br />  - Pink Lemonade [*alright but kinda watery] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OCBSS6">Crystal Light On The Go Pink Lemonade,  10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br />  - Orange Sunrise [*downright, horrifyingly disgusting] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DNL9SI">Crystal Light Sunrise Classic  Orange Drink Mix (10-Quart), 2.5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />  - !!!Try Mixing the flavors together; I have had great success with my experiments!!! ;)<br /><br />  NEW PACKAGING:<br />  - The new method of delivery is as easy as it is awesome. It is great to be able to slowly pour the plastic tubes of powder, rather than the tubs, which exploded in a cloud of pink powder all over my face every time I tried to add them. They also easier to open, especially for those of use who don't have fingernails to peal those pesky, foil wrappings off.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS:<br />  - You definitely take a risk consuming non-sugar beverages that still taste sweet and delicious. No one really knows how these type of drinks will affect human physiology in the long term. Obviously the healthiest alternative to drinking sugar-engorged beverages like cola and strawberry daiquiris would be to just drink water, but we all know that NO ONE REALLY WANTS TO DO THAT. DUH!<br /><br />  STAINS:<br />  - The red, colored drinks stain everything. They will stain the hell out of your hands bright red, and every passerby will ask you why it looks like you just fought the battle of Persepolis. Don't get it on your clothes. It is even hard to get the stain off counter-tops and tables. Don't be a KLUTZ!

review/text: Markets in our area have Crystal Light on "sale" from $2.99 to $3.49 PER container (12 quarts) so Amazon's price is VERY competitive - if you use Subscribe & Save. Plus, you never run out, and its sent right to your door! What could be better? Also, this flavor, Strawberry Kiwi, makes a light pink color drink that doesn't stain like the RED flavors can. Also, sometimes I add a couple tea bags & let them cold brew overnight, for a little more "punch" in the drink. I do all the yardwork/gardening around our house and its so refreshing to have a cold drink ready to pour when I come in from the heat, without worrying about gulping down EMPTY CALORIES (the enemy, right?) So sign up, and enjoy Crystal Light all Summer!

review/summary: An amazing basalmic
review/text: The Cavalli silver label is an amazing Balsamic unlike anything you will have ever bought in the grocery store. It's very rich and sweet with a mild acidic finish.  You will not use this for salads but for cheeses or drizzled as a glaze for quality beef dishes. The good thing is that you need only use a few drops at a time so while expensive, this product will last for 4-6 months with occasional usage.  It's worth it in my humble opinion. I've had a "thing" for balsamic vinegars for many years in the same way that many people do for fine wines. I've experimented with many of the best and this is one of them. Only the Gold label from Cavelli is better but it's considerably more expensive and though I love great Balsamic's I do have limits.

Because of this, I recommend getting a normal pack for "guests" so they won't be tempted to take more than one.<br /><br />Or maybe I just have some greedy people in my office? But seriously, I have people taking 4-5 pieces at a time, so I was going through gum like crazy.<br /><br />Overall though, a good container and a great gum inside it. Good bubblegum taste that lasts without the sugar many brands contain, so it's better for your teeth.

review/text: This is the most horrid tasting gum I have ever purchased.  There is no "mint" to it, not even any honest 1960's bubble gum taste (awful as it may have been), just nastiness.  Do not buy this unless you wish to rapidly become nauseous.  I did not purchase it from Amazon, but rather in a "16 Pack Variety Box" from another vendor.  Other flavors of Orbit White Gum are pleasant, this one is grossly unpleasant.

review/summary: A GREAT TASTING REFRESHING GUM
review/text: I have used this product for about two years now and it is among the best bargains if you are a gum chewer. The best price that I found is at Walmart where they have an even larger size dispenser and refill bags which are even more economical so that you do not have to buy another dispenser barrel every time. I am sensitive to dust and will cough a lot if my throat becomes too dry. So I chew this product several times a day. I also keep a dispenser in my vehicle.

I bought these herb teas to add to my green tea to make it drinkable. The chamomile doesn't have much flavor. But, Celestial Seasonings are fabulous teas, especially all the "zingers".

review/text: I have always been picky with my cheese ever since I was little. However, I was once convinced to tried Dofino's creamy havarti and havn't looked back since. This cheese is good with just about anything you can put cheese on. My favorite way to use this cheese is to spread it on crackers. It makes a delicious snack. I get it at my local grocery store and it is always very fresh. Oh and a warning, I tried a cheaper version of creamy havarti cheese from my supermarket and it was awful so make sure you get the Dofino brand.

I would not recommend this beer making kit. It is just to easy to not get or miss an inventory of the items.<br />The seller I am neutral on. Yes they sent the bung but who cares?

review/text: I've purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not.

review/summary: Best Fruity Preserves Ever.
review/text: You can actually taste the freshness and wholeness of raspberries from this jar. I add about a teaspoon to my morning's oatmeal for breakfast, and it makes a perfect addition. It's not too sweet, just timidly sweet enough to maintain the "jam" experience. Not that I have anything against smuckers or other jam brands, but I would never and cannot go back to those sugary jars of what they claim as fruit preserves (I think they add more sugar than the actual fruit). Let's just say, they've got nothing on Nature's Hollow Preserves :) I've only tried the Raspberry kind, but I've heard good things about apricot and blueberry, too. Would like to try these in the near future as well. All in all, great product - a little pricey you might argue, but it is damn worth the $$ !!

review/text: I ordered this for my brother for Christmas.  I have not had a lot of smoked salmon, but he loves it, so I was going in w/ little experience.<br /><br />The first associate I spoke with very graciously explained the differences between wet and dry smoked salmon---all news to me---and how his product was prepared and packaged.  I ordered it and yes, it was a huge hit with my brother.  He said it was excellent.<br /><br />In the meantime, I had mistakenly placed a second order in ordering other things from Amazon.  My fault.  I notified Amazon, and notified Alaska Smokehouse, and was immediately sent confirmation that the second order had been deleted.  However, I did receive the second oder of smoked salmon, although it never showed up on my credit card statement.<br /><br />I called Alaska Smokehouse to ask how to return the second order and they graciously said to keep the salmon, and please enjoy it as a thank you for being a customer.<br /><br />The same brother had a birthday in January, so I sent the second order to him along w/ the story and he was impressed and delighted. He said at Christmas he had to share, but this time around his salmon was a "protected species"!<br /><br />Great product, great service....what more could one ask for????

review/summary: Smokey and Natrual
review/text: This smoked salmon comes in a sealed, metalized pouch. There are two pouches in the pretty cardboard box. Each pouch needs to be refrigerated when opened, but the unopened (second) pouch keeps at room temperature. Each pouch contains nearly a whole fish. It is filleted and boneless, but it still looks like a fish. The skin is on one side. I like the skin and it is totally edible. If you don't want the skin, it is easy to peel off. Thus, you can serve the fish flesh side up, or skin side up, depending on how you want it to appear. The fish is smoked and flakey. It is NOT like some smoked salmon or lox sold in grocery stores -- which comes in thin, bright "salmon colored" slices. This fish is not sliced, but flakes very easily, a bit like a high quality canned tuna. I find it great for sandwiches, but you have to smoosh it down on the bread with a fork or it will be too thick. You can put it in salads or an omelette, but you will have flakey pieces, not solid slices. The fish has a wonderful smokey aroma and taste. It is also fishy in both smell and taste, but a "nice fishy," not the unpleasant fishy smell that most people think of when you tell them something smells "fishy." This is clearly a more natural "fish like" product that the more processed smoked salmon or lox usually sold in deli's. I thought the quality, texture and flavor were outstanding, and I an pretty picky about my fish and seafood. So, I rate if five stars on all counts. But you should understand the product you are getting.

review/text: I thought I was going to be getting "lox" (which is the only way I like to eat salmon), so I was very disappointed when I opened the package and realized that this was a different kind of smoking. So, if you're looking for lox, don't buy this; it's not prepared the same way. Others will probably find this fish very tasty...It just wasn't what I wanted. The packaging is very good too.

review/summary: Not what you might expect
review/text: I considered the positive reviews posted when I ordered this product so I gave it a try as other people found it good. I eat quite a bit of smoked Mahi, Mullet, Salmon and kingfish from my local smoke house in So. Fla. and think that I have a decerning taste when it comes to "good smoked fish" but I'm sorry to say that this Alaska Smokehouse product is the nastiest foul smelling Salmon once taken out of the foil package that contains the nasty smelling juices that if by chance go down your kitchen sink drain your in for a treat to  remove the funk that will emit from your sink trap. The Salmon was very soft and mushy with just a slight hint of smoke. Couldnt tell if it was brined but by the way it just falls into little mushy globs I think it was a chemical wash. I would think that this is a production line product with very little "by hand " or human interaction combined with many short cuts taken. The box is nice to keep your fishing lures in but its made in China for cripes sake! I mean this product comes from the N.W. and they make the box in China?? Bottom line is DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY on this product as you might as well go purchase a $3.00 can at your grocer and throw a couple drops of "liquid smoke" on it and you'd more than likely have a better product. I would have given this to my cat but was worried how he would digest it so rather than take the chance of a vet visit I bageed it in a few zip lock bags one inside the other as to seal in the disgusting meily smelly funk and put in a trash can down the street!

Lox.<br />I think i might have not read into this correctly, but the items came, far from expectation. They feel and taste like canned salmon. The vacuum seal packed in the flavors, I guess. The oil preserved the salmon well, but it was salty and taste overcooked. I cannot tell if it's smoked or just cooked till dry.<br /><br />I won't order again. But i can see how this would be called smoked salmon. I guess on the good side, i am an innovative cook, so smoked salmon pasta here we come! I think these would go well in dips too.<br /><br />Just not what i wanted.
