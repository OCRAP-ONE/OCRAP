review/summary: Say I Love You , then let it melt in your mouth
review/text: Imagine if you will a 1st grader in 1965.<br /><br />You first learn about the magic Necco Roll on the way to Bobbette's with your friends, it's all the answers you ever need. All the flavors wrapped in chalky goodness to address both the possible pica and the chalkboard things you might have going on, as you are barely making it to boots and coats and bundling up for that first trip away from home....going "to learn." You've hit the big time....you are in school..... where your Necco Roll is "detained" and your parents are "informed" and then you begin the second phase of school, "the hidden curriculum." YES, this very company can supply you well. Confidentially, still.<br /><br />By the time Valentine's came and I got a few of these hearts I knew three things, 1)nirvana was real (if unnamed) 2) there was a force greater than me in the universe 3) my entire fortune rested on what the next heart said.<br /><br />And here I am 44 years later, still pulling out hearts.

review/summary: the seeds are great
review/text: but be ready to spend a lot of time sorting them out. The bag contains small twigs, little pebbles, plus dirt balls and junk. It was tedious and time consuming. But the previous pound I got from another company on here came from Croatia and was not organic plus contains twice as much crap in it. I just thought for the price I wouldn't get all these extras. After soaking some overnight and putting them in a smoothie or making nut milk with them it all seems worth it though. Plus if ya have a kid it is a great job for them sorting.

review/text: I bought this product last year and it was shipped in a dirty box (used before for canned pork).

The company representative said that it is ok to send last year food and I should send it back at my expense. He was not able to check if they have fresher oil.

review/text: I drink A LOT of tea...99% I drink unsweetened just the way it is. I got this because I LOVE lemon and STASH's JASMINE GREEN tea is one of my faves. I sort of envisioned a tart version of that combo, NOT at all. My initial reaction was yuck...so I added some sweetener. YUMMMM It really is very good. Not at all I hoped it would be but I will definitely drink it all up with no complaints. IT'S GOOD!! I like it!!

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I actually bought this at a Whole Foods at $6 for a tin (22 bags), which is a good price when you compare it to the other tins of tea bags on the shelf. I brewed this in almost-boiling water for 4 mins. The thinnish tea bags are nice cause you don't have to squeeze them out so much when they're done.<br /><br />The taste is really nice - probably sounds odd but it reminds me of Fruity Pebbles :) You don't get a lot of the green tea taste. The lemon is the strongest flavor but it's not tart, it's mellowed out by the jasmine. I usually don't add anything to green tea but you could probably get away with some sweetener in this.<br /><br />I'll probably buy this again, and hey, maybe someday I'll be motivated to buy a whole 6-pack of tins from Amazon!

review/summary: And Now for Some Real Warming....
review/text: When Southwest Specialty Foods first sent me an email about this new product, I was moderately skeptical. Most peanut butter is a god-awful mixture of peanuts, sugar, transfat (for that nice creamy taste) and a bit too much salt thrown in on the side.  I just wasn't interested in another product of that sort, even if it included a touch of habanero pepper dust for seasoning. I like my peanut butter to have peanuts, peanut oils, and more or less nothing else.  So I declined to order any.<br /><br />But then, on a recent visit to Phoenix, I had the pleasure of sampling this new product.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover it was a lot more like Adam's Old Fashioned Peanut Butter than disgusting imitations like Peter Pan and Jif.  Even better, it packs a delayed wallop that few Southwest products, at least in the "A-- Kicking" line do.  Indeed, when I took a heaping spoonful my initial reaction was, "where's the heat?"  But as I walked about the store, I quickly discovered that the "kick" grows on you.  (As an aside, those who love hot foods should visit the Southwest Specialty foods warehouse on Bullard Ave in Goodyear, AZ.  It is like a candy store for those with the right tastes, and all products can be sampled free of charge.  That alone is worth the 350 mile drive to visit my wife's relatives.)  In any event, I purchased two jars on the spot, and sent a third to my father in Boise, Idaho, just to share my good fortune.<br /><br />Bottom line.  There are those people who believe in "global warming."  And then there are those who openly wish for it.  If you are in the latter category, this peanut butter is a great place to start.  High quality, with a lasting kick.  It will enhance your lunches for many days to come.

review/text: This peanut butter is soooo good.  I cook a lot with peanut butter, not just for sweets, and it is perfect for spicy peanut soups and thai foods that call for peanut butter and hot peppers.  Try it in African Peanut soup and Peanut noodle bowl recipes.  The peanut butter base has a good flavor, not sweet like typical PB and you don't really 'taste' the habanero, it's more of a feeling.

review/text: As a diabetic I have to be very careful with what I eat.  Low carbs, low sugar and low salt.  This peanut butter is low on all of those...well maybe a little high on salt.  I saw this advertised on the net and decided to buy a jar of it.  THIS STUFF IS GOOD!  It's not really hot, not lethal by any means.  It is just "toasty" enough that you notice it.  It makes great peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!  If you like "hot" stuff I recommend this peanut butter.  Beats the hell out of that other stuff on the market that they call "peanut butter".

review/summary: These crackers are delicious and a perfect bite-sized snack
review/text: These crackers have a light corn bread flavor and texture. They are so good, I have to make sure to put the box away after serving or they will disappear. They are about an inch in size and are sturdy enough to hold a dip. They are fantastic to serve with chili or salsa.  As you can see from the picture of the front of the box, they have no trans fat.  According to the box, a serving of 30g (ab. 16 crackers)contains 3g total fat, 170mg sodium, 21 carbs, 4g sugar, 2g protein. The ingredients listed are: Enriched wheat flour, corn meal, vegetable oil, sugar, invert sugar syrup, whey powder, honey, salt barley malt extract, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, monocalcium phosphate.  In addition the box states the crackers contain milk, wheat, and may contain sesame seeds; and it says that they are suitable for Vegetarian Diets. Try them. I was surprised at how yummy they were.

review/summary: Fresh and Crunchy. Corn Bread Taste. A Good Cracker!
review/text: Here's a real nice snack cracker. I picked them up at my nearby Fresh and Easy store. They're imported from Canada and are known as "Milton's Corn Bread Baked Snack Crackers." Very good product. I had them yesterday for lunch with some kipper snacks. They're low in fat with no trans-fats and, as such, fairly low in calories. Also, they are not particularly salty as are so many snack crackers. They have a real nice corn bread taste and are quite fresh and crunchy. How did I ever miss these? The distributer is right here in nearby Carlsbad.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: LOVE THESE CRACKERS
review/text: The first time I bought cornbread crackers a few years ago, they were the Savoritz brand at Aldi.  When I tried some with a bowl of soup,  I couldn't stop eating them because they were so good. They were only $1.50 at Aldi, but for some reason, they don't have them all year round, so when Aldi didn't have them after I ran out, I found the Milton's crackers at Winn-Dixie for $3.<br /><br />Oct. 22, 2012 -  Aldi has the Savoritz Cornbread Crackers in stock again, but I don't know for how long, so I stocked up today.  They're only $1.29 a box right now, which is even cheaper than the last time I bought them.

review/text: I was veru unsatisfied with this order. First off because these are not the Mars Bars that were advertised, they are not M&M Mars Bars in the light cream colored package, they are in brown papers. Secondly the bars are discolored on one end, like they had been exposed to warmer temperatures and then put in a cooler. Next they expire in November therefore all will need to be eatten quickly or they will end up being thrown away, which they probably will anyways because they are not the bars we were expecting to get. I will not be buying from this seller again. The package did arrive in a timely manner like promised, but I am very unhappy with the product. Also who do I contact about my credit card information being stolen? Yes my credit card information was stolen from this site and I was contacted from my bank alerting me to this matter that someone was trying to buy clothes from a merchant in Great Britan. I am not happy whatsoever.

Now they have it back and it's sweeter than I remember or maybe it's sweeter. ;-)<br /><br />The Snickers with Almonds bar is basically the old Mars bar I remember from when I was a kid. Leave it to Mars, Inc to screw up their own named bar.

review/summary: Way too salty to enjoy
review/text: Having had plantain chips before, I knew them to be somewhat salty, but was not ready for the new level. The Nutrition Facts state that there are 30mg of sodium per 30g of chips (1/1000th of a gram per each gram of chip), which doesn't sound like all that much.<br /><br />However, I had to toss the content of the last bag of "Chifles Plantain Chips with Garlic" into a colander with paper towels and shake them vigorously over the kitchen sink for several minutes before I could attempt to eat these chips. This process eliminated much of the excess seasoning, leaving the paper, colander, and sink heavily coated in seasoning, but the chips were still too salty to enjoy.<br /><br />I really like garlic-flavored plantain chips, so hope that this was just a matter of a bad batch, although even other bags were saltier than I'd like. I will keep an eye out for a low sodium version of Chifles brand and recommend trying a different brand of plantain chips.<br /><br />** Please note that I did NOT buy this particular bag here, but have had these chips on several occasions.

review/summary: Great product!  From corn, not birch
review/text: If you do some research on natural sweeteners with a zero glycemic index, you will see that Erythritol is one of the best. It is a sugar alcohol found in various fruits and vegetables like Xylitol. But unlike Xylitol, it is not dangerously toxic to dogs and does not have bloating, gaseous effects. If you don't need a sweetener without blood sugar effects, you can look at brown rice syrup or agave, since they have a very low effect on blood sugar. If you want no blood sugar effects at all, I'd recommend this, since it has a very nice taste (like sugar) with no aftertaste. Stevia is another option, but is very strong and has a less appealing taste. If you use even a bit too much, Stevia generally has a rather bitter aftertaste. This is not true of Erythritol.<br /><br />I would say the only downside is the cost and that it is only 70% as sweet as sugar. You can spike it with Stevia to make up the difference if you like Stevia. It doesn't take much to add to get it a lot sweeter. You should shake it up really well before using, though.<br /><br />Note: If you want to buy this particular item, I discovered that this company has not charged me extra shipping for more bags going to the same address. I would avoid EmeraldForest, though, because the Erythritol I got from them had a very strange, foul smell -- like mothballs -- and had a faint aftertaste that was the same. Their customer service was very nasty when I called to return it.  I am sticking with Now Foods from now on.

review/summary: The best natural sugar substitute available
review/text: Now Foods' erythritol is a sugar substitute made from corn. By fermenting the corn's sugars, the manufacturer produces a naturally-occurring sugar alcohol product. Sugar alcohols taste exactly like sugar, but without the calories and blood sugar spike. And they are alcohols in chemistry terms only, not to be confused with the kind of alcohol one finds in adult beverages.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />* Tastes just like sugar and has no unpleasant aftertastes, unlike stevia.<br /><br />* Has a glycemic index of zero. Great for diabetics or those simply wishing to eliminate excess sugar from their diets.<br /><br />* Contains virtually no calories.<br /><br />* Made by a manufacturer committed to a wide range of sweeteners and food products, so the company is experienced and trusted in its field.<br /><br />* Erythritol occurs naturally in many foods. The FDA recognizes it as a viable and safe sugar substitute. Erythritol-based sweeteners have been on the market in other countries for years.<br /><br />* Unlike some other sugar alcohols such as xylitol, mannitol, and sorbitol, it will not cause gas if consumed in large amounts.<br /><br />* Not only does erythritol not promote tooth decay, it actually prevents it, inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the mouth.<br /><br />* Can be used in baking.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />* Not quite as sweet as sugar. You need about a quarter to a third more erythritol by volume for an equivalent.<br /><br />* Though it tastes exactly like sugar, erythritol has a slight, mint-like, cooling effect on the tongue. In foods where that effect would be undesirable, erythritol would need to be combined with another sweetener to diminish the effect. (This effect seems to vary from person to person, too.)<br /><br />* In some clear liquids such as tea, adding erythritol will initially cloud the liquid, though the cloudiness fades quickly. (That issue probably comes from the release of oxygen bubbles as the product dissolves.)<br /><br />* Though it dissolves, erythritol does not do so as rapidly as sugar. It will retain its granularity in some foods. (Some people recommended powdering it to compensate.)<br /><br />* Because it involves more steps to make than corn syrup or sugar, this is not a cheap product. Perhaps in the future, economies of scale will drive the price down.<br /><br />Many companies are discovering the benefits of erythritol as a natural sugar substitute that lacks the nagging questions that dog artificial sweeteners like sucralose and aspartame. Now Foods' erythritol is one of the best values in this natural sweetener on the market, available at a much lower price point than some competitors' products. Though not cheap compared with sugar or some artificial sweeteners, as a healthy alternative, it more than makes up for its higher cost.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.

But then, I'm not much of a baker so I'm not worried there.<br />I was simply trying to find a decent, healthy substitute for sugar in my morning coffee.<br />This easily fills that need. I've tried everything, including the forest packets... which just didn't taste right. Truvia, blechhh.. (and I don't want to support Cargill). Pink stuff is nasty and the blue stuff is dangerous.<br />I'm so happy to have found this that I filled up my sugar bowl with it, and I brought a package to work to use there as well. I even gave a package to my ex-husband who's diabetic and I don't even like him! That's how excited about it I am.<br />Overall, I could not be more pleased. I'm pretty sure you will be too.

review/summary: Great for making lemonade and limeade
review/text: I mainly use this for making lemonade and limeade (using fresh-squeezed lemon and lime juice).  Erythritol gives the same mouthfeel as regular sugar when used in sweetened drinks and tastes almost identical to regular sucrose table sugar.  It's a tad expensive so I use a cup of this per two quarts of lemon or limeade and then use sucralose (splenda) to make up the difference.  This mixture almost eliminates the aftertaste of the splenda and is almost indistinguishable from regular full-sugar drinks.

review/summary: No unpleasant aftertaste, blood sugar friendly, way less gas than xylitol
review/text: I've been controlling my Type2 diabetic blood sugar with exercise, oral medication and only whole grain, high fiber, low glycemic carbs.And xylitol in my coffee and on my oatmeal. More beans than before as well. Just can't afford the high protein very low carb approach. Doctor satisfied with my blood tests, but I've been paying the price in the gas department.<br /><br />It's been said that the gas associated with both xylitol and with +++ soluble fiber decreases over time as your body gets used to them but I kept waiting for an improvement until this past week when I substituted erythritol for the xylitol at breakfast. Major improvement, a reduction on the order of something like 80-90%. Still a bit of gas, but then that could just be all the soluble fiber.<br /><br />So goodbye xylitol. The erythritol is indeed a bit less sweet and a bit more expensive but worth it in my opinion. May have to just learn to take my coffee a bit less sweet in the interest of economy. Doubt if I'll be getting into baking with it.

review/text: I made sugar-free merengues with this sweetener and they turned out beautifully. This sweetener does have a cooling effect on the tongue just like peppermint, so you will either need to use it in combination with another sweetener, or plan for this effect (I used peppermint flavoring, so it was fine).  In heavier baked goods with more ingredients, this isn't a problem, but frosting/icings and merengues can't cover it up.<br /><br />I've also used it to make carb-free flaxmeal cornbread and chocolate cake, and it is amazing. No funky aftertaste like splenda, equal, and sweet n'low.  The cooling effect is undetectable in the more complex recipes.

review/text: I had to watch my blood sugar when I had gestational diabetes, but I wasn't willing to give up coffee (pry it from my cold, dead hands!).  I tried erythritol, and while it is definitely not as sweet as sugar, I find that I prefer it now to sugar.  Six months after my GD went away (baby was born, and she's adorable, thanks for asking ;), I still get this instead of sugar.  It is more expensive, but worth the peace of mind in knowing that I am at least not contributing further to my 60% increased risk of Type 2.<br /><br />So, if you need an alternative to sugar, or a way to have your coffee without feeling guilty, I recommend this product.

review/text: This is very sweet and I have found I can cut down on the amount of sugar called for in a recipe in which I substitute this sweet stuff. I made German Chocolate Pie which I portioned into custard cups instead of putting into a pie shell. The erythritol sank to the bottom and crystallized when refrigerated and in order to liquify it again I had to really cook the cups in the microwave about 2 minutes, otherwise there was a sweet crystalline crust at the bottom. Next time I will use only 1/2 the amount called for and serve it hot. It worked very well in the apple-raisin pie though. A good find.

review/summary: Meh...  Expensive, and a little irritation.
review/text: Cons:<br /><br />1. Erythritol is expensive. At $8.29/pound (which is the cheapest I've found online), and 113 teaspoons per pound, that's 22 cents per 3 teaspoons, to give the sweetening power of two teaspoons of sugar (sucrose.)<br /><br />2. It's not as sweet, teaspoon per teaspoon, as sugar, hence you use about 50% more.<br /><br />3. At 3 teaspoons per 8 fluid ounces of soft drink (or 6 teaspoons per 1/2 liter bottle) it gives me a little bit of STOMACH UPSET.  Therefore, I can't use it as the only sweetener.  I need to cut it back and use artificial sweetener to make up the rest.  (I make soft drinks using sugar-free drink mix, then add my own sweetener.)<br /><br />4. It does not dissolve well.  It takes a long time to completely dissolve in cool water, and even in water at room temperature.  If you want to dissolve it quickly, heat a glass of water in the microwave, dissolve it, then add to cool water in the pitcher with ice.<br /><br />Good:<br /><br />5. It's a "good" sweetness, compared to the artificiality of sucralose, aspartame, saccharine, or stevia.<br /><br />6. Of course, it's almost ZERO CALORIE, with NO GLUCOSE.  It's great for a serious weight loss regimen, and for diabetics.<br /><br />--<br /><br />Before I discovered erythritol, I used a combination of sucralose and stevia to sweeten my soft drinks. Maybe my digestive system will get used to erythritol.  But for the time being, I need to avoid 100% (or full strength) erythritol, and either use a little stevia or sucralose or sucrose to get the level of sweetness I want.<br /><br />I found generic stevia packets at Dollar General stores ($1.00 per 35 packets), where 1 packet of stevia equals about 2 teaspoons of sugar.  And you can get generic sucralose for about $1.00 to $2.00  for a box of 100 packets, or buy in bulk for even cheaper at Walmart.<br /><br />Bottom line, unless money is no object, erythritol is not a 100% substitute for sugar (sucrose).<br /><br />And, due to mild stomach upset (which varies person to person, some don't have any upset at all) it still can't be a 100% substitute, and needs to be used in combination with another non-irritating non-caloric sweetener, or even regular sucrose.<br /><br />If you're on a budget, and HAVE to cut back on sugar, it's just much cheaper to learn to get by with less sweets.<br /><br />Or, if you HAVE to have your sweets, learn what combination of sweeteners, (erythritol, sucralose, saccharin, stevia, sugar) gets you the flavor/sweetness you like at the calories and expense that you can handle.<br /><br />(Personally, I don't think sucralose and saccharin are as bad for you as aspartame. And stevia hasn't been studied enough, but probably isn't bad in small quantities.)

review/summary: Broken Jars Upon Arrival
review/text: Patak's curry pastes are wonderfully delicious, and very convenient.  I've used their Tikka Masala paste to make Chicken Tikka Masala many times, and have always been very happy with the results.  Unfortunately, I can't find the Tikka Masala paste locally, so I was happy to see it for a reasonable price on Amazon.com.  I anxiously awaited the arrival of my pastes, but when they got here, one of the jars was broken, and a second jar's lid had been knocked loose.  I had to carefully extract the other four jars, and wash them off before I could store them.  So of the six jars of Patak's Tikka Masala paste that I ordered, only four arrived intact.

review/text: I have been using store bought Vanilla Extract for a long time in my baking.  More recently, I have been buying gourmet vanilla extract online and this Vanilla blows every other product out of the kitchen.  It is the perfect strength of vanilla, which makes my baking goods the talk among the guest.  I look forward in trying Wild Bean Vanilla's other products.

review/summary: Tasty noms!
review/text: I ordered the pumpkin and banana treats and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DZQ0PA">Fruitables All-Natural Pumpkin & Apple Dog Treat, 1.41oz pouch (Pack of 6)</a> on sale. My shepherd-chow mutt likes them, but then Lulu's never met a treat she didn't like! She doesn't seem to prefer one flavor over the other, and she doesn't go bananas for either flavor like she does for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>.<br /><br />I like these treats because they are healthy, natural, and low calorie (important for an older, ahem, "big boned" dog). They even smell great, like people food. I'll probably buy more in the future to alternate with her meaty treats, but I'll buy the larger bags. I wouldn't have bought treats packaged this way if they hadn't been on sale. It's a waste of packaging.

review/summary: A little different than I thought
review/text: I am not saying I don't like this product, it smells very good. Our husky loves them but we also have a Maltese and I bought them for her but they are a little large and also very hard and for some reason I guess I had in my mind they might be a little softer. So just for information only purposes these are about 1" round and very crispy hard treats. So keep that in mind if buying for a tiny dog. I do like the idea of them being ackaged in smaller bags so they stay fresh.

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: Be aware of the quantity you're ordering! When I ordered, this was offered as a pack of 6. Only one was delivered to me, and when I called Amazon, they kindly rush-shipped the replacement (I only asked for 5, but they said they would send 6) the next day. The next day, I again only received one. I called them again -- this time, they wanted me to ship back the treats so they could do an investigation on their warehouse because "something is clearly wrong." Excuse me? You want me to take the time to go to the post office to send back a few bucks worth of dog treats so I can wait for YOU to do an investigation on what's going wrong in YOUR warehouse? Not wise, Amazon -- you should have sent me my replacement that I was entitled to, and promptly at that.

review/text: I bought these to put in a treat ball for my puppy.  She really likes the Newman's pnut butter snacks and I wanted something different to go with it.  She really likes them and they are small enough to use as training treats or to fit in Kongs or other treat toys.  Her favoite is to stuff a kong with a couple of fruitables then a Newman's pnut butter and then block them all in with a Veggie Life sweet potato chew.  I usually give her a stuffed kong when I leave for work.  I like that the products are naturaly and healthier for her than doggy junk food.

review/summary: Kitty Grass
review/text: We have an indoor cat and like to grow "grass" for her. We have purchased Cosmic Kitty Herbs for years, but have not been able to find it recently in the Seattle area. After weeks of unsuccessfully trying to get it at our regular source here, I was delighted to be able to order it at Amazon.com.<br /><br />With this product, we can grow small amounts at a time. This is very important because none of the grown grass we have tried has a long life span. Our cat likes to munch on the fresh product; we are not wasting a bunch of grown grass/herbs since we can make small batches available to her at a time. With similar products we have tried, we end up throwing a lot into the recycle bin.

review/summary: Bonsai!
review/text: Ever since I saw Mr Miyagi in the Karate Kid meticulously pruning his Bonsai tree with a pair of toenail clippers I've wanted one of these cute little trees.<br /><br />When it arrived I was immediately impressed. It looked just like the picture here on Amazon. Well packaged & healthy. Many months later its still going strong. It even grew enough so that I had the opportunity to break out the toenail clippers & have some fun. If you're into that sort of thing, this is a great little tree. If not it makes a great gift. Either way I think you'll be happy.<br /><br />UPDATE I<br />Two years later & the same little tree is still going strong.<br /><br />UPDATE II<br />Four years later sadly I must report my favorite little tree is no more. She began drying out over the Winter, no amount of watering seemed to help. I attribute this to low humidity & it possibly being too close to the baseboard heating. Who knows though? *shrug* I can't really complain. For the price I payed I received many years of enjoyment. Will probably buy another come the holidays.

review/text: I bought this tree about 2 years ago, it lasted me for about a year and 2 months which is amazing considering how (unintentionally) poorly i treated it. Sometimes it would go for days without watering (I have terrible memory for little things like that), but I think where I really harmed it was because I didn't set it very close to a good light source. But I have to say it is a very resilient and beautiful tree, perfect for people like me who want a little life in their room but don't have the knack for gardening.

Also, the soil kind of slopes up to the center where the trunk is and because the pot isn't very tall, it's kind of hard to water.

review/summary: My first tree.
review/text: This is the first bonsai tree I ever bought. I didn't really know it was possible to mail plants. I thought they'd die without sunlight and all a lot quicker. You know? However, it came and I was pretty excited to see it wasn't even in that bad shape. The bonsai trees are small, which I liked. I can't wait for like 3o years to pass when I can see how much prettier it looks. I'm excited to watch it grow. I'm glad I got it in the beginning of it's life.<br /><br />Anyways I've had it about two weeks and the bit of yellowish color and dead looking parts are gone(there was a slight yellow hue on a bit of it). It's just been growing really great. I just hope I can keep it alive and make it pretty. I sort of wish I could upload a picture so everybody could see what mine looks like. Anyways, if you are thinking about buying a tree from them don't worry or anything. They've got good trees and you won't regret it.

The tree cannot be more than a season and a half old (while the description says that it is a 3-year-old tree), and is about 3 1/2" - 4" tall. That being said, there is plenty of new growth and it was packaged well (no breakage and soil was still wet) and I received it quicker than I was expecting.

review/summary: Great little tree!
review/text: Came in great condition and packaged just as the other reviews said, obviously it didn't look EXACTLY like the picture and had a different pot, but it was very similar and looked beautiful anyway! (The pot was actually better looking than the one in the picture, in my opinion) Would definitely order from this seller again!

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: Came on the scheduled time. Looked very healthy except for the little brown tips but that's only natural because of the travel time it took to get here. Very awesome looking bonsai pot. It looks like something you would see in an anime or a martial arts movie!

review/text: Bonsai Boy is a great store to order from! I ordered this juniper for my first bonsai and it came by the end of the week and was very well packaged. There was no sign of damage to the tree and it is doing great!

review/text: This item shipped very fast and it came in excellent condition. I had to prune it a bit to make it look the way that I wanted it to, but overall all it's a great buy. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Great gift
review/text: I bought the bonsai juniper tree for my boyfriend's 21 birthday. He knew a lot about bonsai trees and how to properly take care of them. The tree came in really fast! I bought it a week before his birthday and was afraid that it was not going to come in on time; it actually came in before the expected delivery date. It was neatly packaged and in perfect condition. It is still alive and healthy. With the right tools and knowledge this tree can last for a long time. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good birthday gift.

review/summary: Surprised
review/text: After reading some of the negative reviews, I was expecting a twig in a pot of dirt.  To my surprise, the tree has arrived on day one with full, green foliage.  This is my first bonsai tree and wasn't expecting much for the price but I am very satisfied with my purchase.  The vendor also included a small bag of fertilizer, another pleasant surprise.  I'd definitely recommend the product.  I just hope I don't kill it!

review/summary: Cute plant
review/text: Arrived well packaged and healthy with a tip sheet.  It's a fairly smallish plant in a decent looking blue clay pot. Worth the money I spent and a great starter for bonsai beginners.
