review/summary: Healthy but pricey; may be better to get cans & recycle
review/text: Definitely healthy & tasty food.  Both my cats really like it. Grain-free, a plus for cats who get "tummy trouble" on cheap food or are just super-picky. No byproducts. BUT, it's REALLY expensive, even when compared to other Wellness produts.  The pouch has a lot of "juice," so even at the same # of ounces, Wellness grain-free canned products have more "food," and are a much better value.

review/summary: Caution!
review/text: The "Healthy Indulgence" pouches of cat food are prepared with FLUORIDATED water! A number of studies have now shown that fluoridated water increases the risk of osteosarcoma or bone cancer in humans and animals. Alone from my own circle of friends, two have lost their pets to bone cancer, most likely as a result of the animals' having consumed fluoridated water! BUYER BEWARE!

review/text: I bought some of these for doggie birthdays in the past and they absolutly loved them, so I figured if I was sending out Christmas Cards to humans, why couldn't I send Doggie Christmas Cards?! Everyday I would get a phone call from someone telling me "HOW CUTE" they were and what a great idea! They loved the idea! Not to mention the dogs being able to eat their card!

review/summary: Never Got them
review/text: I have always gotten their cards before and my dogs loved them for Christmas. However, this time, after a couple of weeks of not getting the cards, I emailed the company and asked if they could send a couple of other cards. They replied that I should wait to see if I would get them and if not let them know. They never came and as it was too close to Christmas, I just gave up.

review/summary: Delicious and addictive
review/text: These candies are delicious, and that's a problem for me, it's hard to stop eating them.  The serving size is 3 pc., which contains 38g. of carbohydrates, most of it in a form of malitol syrup and malitol.  Malitol syrup has a glycemic index of 52, malitol in powdered form GI=32, and regular sugar is 60. It will raise a blood sugar levels, especially if you are diabetic.

review/text: I looooooooooooooved this candy in my pre-diabetes days, so finding it was available sugar free was thrilling.  And this version is every bit as tasty and smoothly textured and chewy and nutty and satisfying as the original!<br /><br />Every blessed carb in them is sugar alcohol, so don't be a piggy and wolf half the box down like I did, or you'll pay for it with, err, intestinal distress.<br /><br />Still, such eruptions are not the candy's fault.  They're wonderful and worth the risk if you have better self-control and enjoy in moderation.  Distinctly fruity (in lots of helpfully labeled flavors), laced with a few nuts, and a pleasure to work over in your mouth.

review/summary: superb product at a superb price
review/text: At my local grocery store, these cans sell for almost $3 each, so I was excited by this bargain. However, the price didn't totally decide me on buying them, as I love artichoke hearts.<br /><br />These are excellent. They're quartered, so they're much easier to use in recipes, etc. I like to chop them up even more and add them to salads, pasta sauces, pizza toppings, etc.<br /><br />They are NOT marinated, so don't expect all sorts of olive oil and vinegar tastes. These are a mite salty, so rinse them if you're not a huge salt lover (I am not one myself, so I rinse pretty diligently).<br /><br />My fave way to use them:<br />I heat up some olive oil in a skillet and add minced garlic. Once the garlic is beginning to brown slightly, I add 2 cups of chopped tomatoes, 1 cup of the chopped artichokes, some chopped black olives, and whatever Italian seasonings light my fire that day. I cook this down until the tomatoes are soft, then add the mix to some whole wheat pasta and toss. I sprinkle some fresh parmesan, and voila! Sometimes, I add chopped chicken breast to the mix. Sometimes I use chopped sweet Italian sausage. Delicious!<br /><br />Anyway, these are an incredible bargain, and you can't go wrong. Just using the artichoke hearts is enough to go through several cans.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/text: Ick! I planned to add two cans of quartered artichoke hearts to a fancy tortellini and shrimp salad I am bringing to a party in a few hours. What a bummer to open the can and find limp, pale yellow (brown in some spots) soggy artichoke hearts, all with leaves and a portion of the artichoke bottom so tough I couldn't bite through them. Horrible. I threw them out, and will have to carry my dish to the party sans artichoke hearts.

review/text: Recommend buying when Amazon has a special offer because these are very expensive. But, the product itself is great. I like the quartered ones better because they seem to put the tender pieces in there.  The whole ones have a lot of parts that you can't really eat because they are the tougher outside leaves.<br /><br />I eat them with a little season salt or mayo.

review/summary: Best Canned Artichokes Out There!
review/text: UPDATE - 8/9/2010<br />A lot can happen in just a couple months, the last two cases of these I have ordered from Amazon have been horrible.  I've had whole artichoke leaves in several cans (not the small soft leaves near the heart, I'm talking the big tough artichoke leaves). Brown spots over many of the artichokes.  Very poor quality.<br /><br />I contacted Amazon both times, the first time they replaced the case and the quality was much better.  The second time I asked them for a refund because two times in a couple months is not acceptable. I also contacted Reese direcly who doubted me and asked me to "prove it" by sending them two cans at my expense. I told them I'd gladly send them all the cans at their expense, but they would not do that. My impression of Reese has changed very much and I will no longer buy their products.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW - I've tried just about every brand out there and Reese, by far, is the best!  I love that you can buy them already quartered, great for tossing into salads.<br /><br />They are always good quality, not too firm, not too soft. Consistent taste, never a bad one in any can. Best price on Amazon too, about $1 cheaper per can then my local grocery store.

review/text: I've been buying this product for about a year by the 12 units case. The last 2 cases have been horrible, I should have stopped buying them when I got the first bad one. 2 of the 12 cans were banged and when I opened them the artichokes were spoiled, awful smell and color. The rest of the 10 cans all of them taste weird, don't know if over ripe. I ate them anyway they didn't seem spoiled just unpleasant taste that i disguised with dressing. Next case same weird flavor. I will buy them at the grocery store from now on by the unit, price is even cheaper in some stores.

review/summary: Like the artichoke, like the price--very handy to have in pantry
review/text: I love artichoke hearts and I hate to cook, so when I can, I go for convenience: nothing's faster than opening a can.<br /><br />I was leery ordering a brand I hadn't tried like I had Cento, Haddon House, Whole Foods's 365 brand, other supermarket brands. But, well, the reviews and price lured me.<br /><br />Very glad I took the subscribe/save bait. I like these. Very good canned artichokes--and yes, we won't compare with fresh or even frozen, we're talking CANNED. Very nice. Very handy.<br /><br />I rinse them right in the can several times, then I can quickly saute them with some EVOO and garlic and lemon juice for a great side dish. Or toss them in pasta with spinach and aglio olio sauce or alfredo sauce. Or just some mozzarella on top. Toss them in salads. Add them to omelettes.<br /><br />I find this brand has less "toss away" hard or dark bits like some brands do. In fact, very little "toss away" bits. I think in the first can I tried, ONE hard piece I pushed to the side of the plate.<br /><br />I use them wherever it strikes me.<br /><br />Very happy I risked trying these. I will keep them on my S&S to reorder as needed. Thanks, amazon. And thanks to the reviewers that made it easier for me to give these a shot.

But great to share among friends and family.<br /><br />I had a wonderful friend from England, who taught me about afternoon tea.  Sampled some of his variedly English/Irish teas.  PG Tips and Typooh had a nice mild flavor but it was missing something.  Then he introduce me to Barry's Tea..  A stronger taste but not overwhelming the pallet. A black tea aroma with some light hint of spice.  Great with some milk, sugar, yummy Biscuits, Scones and Finger Sandwiches.

review/text: We first tasted this tea in Ireland, brought home a box, and then searched for more when it ran out.  It's smooth, without the "bite" of many American teas.  I make a pot each morning and take it in an old Stanley thermos to work; it never loses its flavor.  I checked everywhere for the best buy on this tea, and the price is best by far on Amazon.  I saw a box in a store recently for $12.99, but when I buy six boxes at a time, it's about $8 on Amazon for 80 teabags.  The boxes keep well, with no loss in taste.  Great product for a great price through Amazon!

review/summary: Best tea
review/text: This is my favorite everyday tea. I drink at least two cups a day, sometimes more. It's nice and strong without being overdone like some breakfast teas are. It's also not smoky like Twinings Irish breakfast tea. Barry's is itself. Nothing else like it. I take my stash with me when I travel. It deserves 10 stars.

review/summary: Tea tfrom Amazon to Bring me Home Again
review/text: This is REAL Irish tea.  Many teas produced for this country are watered down for what is perceived as American taste.  An example is Twinnings tea which has strong flavor and body when purchased within England but has a weak and insipid flavor even when purchased at a British airport.  My father would have called it "shamrock" tea, meaning only three leaves were used in its making. Barrys has not followed that trend and this tea purchased in the U.S. is as flavorful as when purchased in Ireland.  If you know tea (and having grown up in Ireland I do) Barrys fills the bill.

review/summary: Tea that takes us back to Ireland
review/text: While staying at B&Bs on a trip across Ireland, we fell in love drinking hot tea with milk to start the day. We tried several varieties after getting home and settled on Barrys Gold Blend as the closest to what we had abroad. We add boiling water, cover with a tea cozy, let it steep half an hour (if you can wait that long), and enjoy it with McVities Digestive Biscuits to re-live our vacation.

review/summary: Nando's is the BEST! Why doesn't The States have Nando's??
review/text: Living in the UK, my husband and I enjoyed Nando's frequently. However, now in The States, there seem to be no Nando's restaurants! I am trying to understand how this could be when there are a million other mediocre restaurants here. KFC's nasty and fatty tasting chicken and sides could be well replaced with Nando's flame grilled peri-peri chicken dishes and their sides are better too... corn on the cob, chips(fries) with peri-peri spice which also taste great dipped in the Nando's peri-peri sauce, garlic bread, and my favourite spicy rice!<br /><br />Seriously, if you haven't tried Nando's sauces you need to because it's the best I've ever tasted. If you live in The States it will be unlike anything you've ever had before and you'll love it. The Medium Peri-Peri is hot enough for my tastes, but if you can it's good to try to consume the Hot Nando's Peri-Peri as well as it contains more chillis. The more hot chillis one can consume the better for their metabolism and health. So, Nando's is not only a tasty choice, it is also a healthy one.

review/summary: Great flavor, great kick!
review/text: After eating at a couple of Nando's restaurants on a recent trip to South Africa, I just had to bring some of this sauce home with me.  It's got a tangy flavor that is great on chicken, roasted potatoes, or even just mixed in with some rice.  Be aware, though, that even the medium sauce packs a punch.  If you've got sensitive taste buds, you might look for the mild stuff, or just use this with a little caution.  Just get it!

review/text: While living in the UK for 3 years, my husband and I became addicted to Nando's!  After moving back to the US, we were ecstatic to find Nando's at World Market and Safeway (?!?!)  Several months ago they suddenly both quit carrying it :(  It's great to use as a marinade on chicken breasts, and then as a sauce.  My favorite is to make a chicken pita sandwich using a grilled chicken breast marinated in the med. sauce, pineaple ring, swiss cheese, shreded cabbage, in a pita with garlic peri peri.  MMMMM!!!  BTW, I heard they opened a restaurant in DC.  Maybe more on the way???

review/text: I watch a YouTuber from England who always talks about drinking Lucozade, and living stateside I'd never heard of it and wanted to try it. So when I ordered it I didn't expect it to arrive so soon, but it got here fast. Everything was great, and if you live in the US, I encourage trying it if you like energy drinks, it's definitely a different taste in comparison to the ones we have here. It's a little expensive for a liter of anything, but I thought it was worth trying, which in my opinion it was.

review/summary: Good for What Ails You
review/text: Lucozade has been around for as long as I can remember, long before competitors like Red Bull and Monster Energy began hitting the shelves in a sea of brash advertising. As a youngster everytime I was poorly my grandmother would bring me round a bunch of grapes and a big bottle of original lucozade. The extra calories (350 per 500ml) and sugar (21.8g per 500ml)would always make me feel better, giving me the sugars my body had been missing while poorly.<br />While, for me at least, lucozade does not give me a huge energy boost, it is good for allowing me to get through a particularly tough workout, by replacing fluids and sugars. It is also good for giving that little extra needed to get through a tough working day getting those last niggly bits of work done.<br />For a longer term healthier and energised feeling amazon users can try Gene Eden which as an antiviral (all natural..hurray)supplement helps to fend of colds and reduce latent viruses, giving a longer term energy boost.<br />Gene-Eden: Antiviral Natural Remedy for Latent HPV, EBV, Herpes, Hepatitis, Safe, Effective, Patented Formula

review/summary: Fantastic seasoning salt
review/text: If you use seasoning salt in your cooking, you may want to try this instead. Usually I use custom mixes for seasoning things, but we got this to test a recipe. My family loved it.<br /><br />Use it where you would use seasoning salt or even salt and pepper to season foods you're cooking. The instructions says to add it until it's salty enough, and it's about 1/3 salt by weight. So if you know how much salt you like to use, use about 3 times as much of this instead. The mix of flavors is a great accompaniment to meats, vegetables and soup.<br /><br />One of my favorite simple dishes is to peel and cut up a sweet potato into wedges, and pat dry 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts. Heat up 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large cast iron skillet. Add the sweet potatoes and sprinkle Tony's over them. Season both chicken breasts on both sides well. Sear the chicken breasts in the same pan as the sweet potatoes on both sides, then cover, turn down, and simmer until done. It's simple and tastes fantastic. It's not really spicy even though it has red pepper in it. Just spicy enough for people who don't like a lot of heat.

review/summary: Tony Chachere's Original Creole Seasoning
review/text: I've always used other products similar to this FOREVER.  My son brought a container of this stuff while visiting a few weeks ago and we used it.  I was immediately HOOKED!  I use it on just about everything too.  I sprinkle a bit on fried or scrambled eggs, add it to a Marie Calendar's Chicken Pot Pie to make it perfect, great on mashed or baked potatoes and adds a bit of Creole flavor plus zing to a medium-rare Rib Eye Steak too, and much much more.  It has just the right spices for a mild "kick" right when you need it.  After trying it, I got on-line and purchased several of these containers.  They are reasonably priced so good on a budget also!  As birthdays come up, this is what I'm giving to my friends for their birthday present!  Much much better than just a card, wouldn't you agree?!

review/summary: Excellent seasoning;  be mindful of the expiration date
review/text: This is a really excellent seasoning.  I first had it at a Boy Scout camp in New Mexico, where it was around for every meal and was put on *everything*.  In an environment like a Boy Scout camp, where food is mass produced and isn't of the greatest quality, this stuff is essential.  It makes everything palatable, which is great.<br /><br />I didn't find the stuff again for about 10 years, when I was surprised to see it on the shelf of my local grocery store.  What amazed me that although it is excellent in making mediocre food better, it also makes *good* food taste better, too.  I don't use it on everything, like at camp, but it's great for things like seasoning home made french fries or potatoes.  It is a bit salt-heavy, so you should know that ahead of time, but if you like moderately salty foods you'll enjoy it.  If you haven't had this before, get a smaller, single jar before getting the large six pack.<br /><br />You should know that a six-pack of 17-oz jars is a LOT of seasoning, and the expiration date is about 2 years from manufacture - there's almost no way for a single family to eat this much seasoning in that time.  I bought this to give some away as gifts (my family loves this stuff too, and it's hard to find).  If you don't have any plans for these besides eating them yourself - look for a smaller package than this.

For some reason, Campbell puts milk products in all but the original, very salty, chicken noodle soup and this Heart Healthy Homestyle Chicken Noodle Soup.  It is convenient to buy this product from Amazon.com without worrying about mistakenly buying one of the Campbell's milk containing chicken noodle soups from the grocery store.

review/text: Got the elements faster than promised which was great. Quality of the elements were as expected.  However, I ordered 4 bags of 1/4" and received 3 bags of 1/4"and one of 3/8".  What a pain! Despite the fact that the sizes are clearly written on the package, the provider has caused me to waste money on elements that we'll never use since nothing but 1/4"are allowed on our track.

review/summary: Not nearly as effective as the Catchmaster brand
review/text: I usually use the Catchmaster brand traps, but saw these in the store and thought I'd give them a try. While they have the same design as the Catchmaster (basically a cardboard triangle with a sticky interior and a scent lure to attract the male moths) they don't work nearly as well. In the same cabinet, the Catchmaster trapped over a dozen moths; the Safer only got one.<br /><br />I'll be sticking (sorry for the horrid pun) with the Catchmaster from now on.

review/summary: Adhesive not effective
review/text: Bought these from the local hardware store because the house was infested with indian moths. The traps come already assembled and the adhesive is already exposed. Set these up in the kitchen and pantry and came back and saw the moths left brown tracks on the adhesive but managed to escape because who knows how long the trap has been sitting in the shelf. There is no protective cover on the adhesive to peel off like other moth traps on the market and so the adhesive is not very effective in adhering to the moths. Will be trying Catchmaster traps since the adhesive has a protective backing to be peeled off when ready to use.

review/summary: Got the job done
review/text: Brought pantry moths home in a bag of cat food.  The trap seemed to catch many of them, and eventually, after a few rounds of purchasing traps, I stopped seeing evidence of moths in my kitchen.<br /><br />A word of caution: If you live in an apartment or have neighbors who live very close, make sure that the moths are coming from your home and not in the windows.  After my own infestation was cleared up, I noticed that moths were coming in through the windows to get to the lures.  As soon as your home is moth-free, get rid of the traps or you might end up with a new problem!

review/summary: Great traps!
review/text: I have a serious infestation going on.  I kept hoping they would die out but after walking into a room and seeing literally a dozen or more flying around I went out to buy traps.  These were the only ones available and I was skeptical about them.  I set up the two in the package and went to wash my hands. When I turned around there were at least 12-15 moths flying around the trap already!  I keep going back to the store to buy more because they get full it attracts so many.  I counted 30 in one trap alone!  I can't vouch for length of effectiveness because they fill up but they DEFINITELY catch them!  I would absolutely recommend them.

review/text: I love this because (1) no chemicals in our kitchen 2) it really works and saves our kitchen/pantry from moths and 3) is easy to hide or place anywhere. I would highly recommend these. Order extra so you can replace them every few months. It's completely worth not having to throw away food that is fulled with moths (which happened to us last year!) These have been a lifesaver.

review/summary: Very Small Adhesive Area
review/text: I had a bad infestation of pantry moths and tried this brand but was very disappointed to find that the area where the moths stick is very small even though the cardboard trap is as large as the other competitors traps.  The sticky area fills up with moths and wing scale very quickly and then is totally useless even though it is supposed to last for three months.  Poor Design.... I guess they want you to buy a lot of these.  Check out the other brands.  The best I found are the Pro-Pest Pheronet Brand.  It is here on Amazon:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003F0UOJY">Pantry Moth Traps - Set of Three</a>

The instructions are not real good but if you read them carefully and not drop the little tab through the hole, but slid it under the tab until it drops, it will go where it should go. You may need to use the  corner of the envelope the tab comes in to push it all the way through.

review/summary: Safe and effective for getting rid of those pesky moths
review/text: We had tiny little moths that seemed to come into our home from packaged grains that we purchased from the grocery store.  Once we had them, they just seemed to multiply.  I didn't want to use toxic sprays or cleaners in the pantry so I was happy to find these easy to use pantry pest traps.  All you have to do is fold the traps into a triangle with the sticky stuff inside and open the little dot with the pheromone (a scent that attracts the moths) and drop it into the trap so it sticks on the side.  Then just set the trap in an area where the moths are.  You won't be able to smell the lure, but the moths will.<br /><br />It takes a week or so to trap all the moths, and each trap lasts for up to 3 months.  I was surprised at how many moths it trapped.  We also used one in the garage near the bags of bird seed and thistle.  Moths seem to be attracted to that too and we caught a lot of them in there.  Two thumbs up for a safe and effective product.

review/summary: MOTH TRAPS STIR UP MOTHS BUT ONLY ONE TRAPPED
review/text: We had few  moths hanging around on the walls, swatted them but each day another couple of moths again, no larva found.<br />Bought the safer brand pantry pest trap.  When I opened the box the two traps had the lure pkts stuck in the traps; I had to pry them out of the sticky stuff and then open the lure packets.  Suddenly 5 moths swarmed around me.  I set the traps as instructed, saw one moth fly near the trap; one went in and came right out.  The others just swarmed near the trap but never went inside.  I had to kill them myself.  Then I took the other trap out of the pantry closet because it didn't catch any moths after three days.  I put that trap over the kitchen cabinet and immediately one moth showed up flew around and went in and did not come out.  Three days later no other moth went into the trap.  I haven't seen as many moths as before.  In the meantime I've checked cabinets, drawers, vacuumed and went over most of the kitchen.  No larva, just a couple of dead moths  in a pot cabinet.  For now I can't say the traps worked well.

review/summary: Caught one by mistake
review/text: I purchased 8 of these and had to give a star otherwise there would be none but I did learn a lesson.  We had a massive number of moths appear almost overnight and our house was full, they were everywhere.  A white ceiling looked dark there were so many.  I set these traps out and in four days I caught one (1) single moth.  I do believe it was an accident on his part taking a wrong turn and getting stuck inside.  I would not try them again having checked locally finding them 30% cheaper before shipping.  So look at your local hardware stores but not for these I wouldn't hit a dog in the back side with these.  Ask what is good and in a day you will be moth free.  We bombed the whole house and vacuumed them up.  End of story.

review/summary: Didn't work for me
review/text: I bought these traps and had no luck whatsoever. I had loads of moths and I had used another brand, which worked very well, but that brand was no longer available. Then I bought this brand and it didn't catch one moth. I used one trap with one square of pheromone. I followed the directions completely. In other words, I don't think the problem was me. I have to wonder whether these sat on the store shelf too long. Anyway I took them back to the store and got my money back.<br /><br />It might be hard to return these if they catch one of a hundred moths and are therefore used and slightly successful. Fortunately for me they did nothing.<br /><br />I now have another infestation and need to do something about it, but I don't know what I'll do as I need a product that is 100% successful, else the remaining moths will replicate.

Just drop the bait (which is about 1/2" square and thin) on to the sticky part of the trap, set it and voila!  In 2 days several moths were removed from the area.  In a few more days I no longer see moths anywhere.  No ill effects to my birds or to us.  Great product.
