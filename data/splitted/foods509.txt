review/summary: Dented Cans
review/text: The product is great!!  We love it and first tried it from a local store.  A couple of months ago I decided to try the subscribe and save as it was a little less....big mistake!!  The savings were not worth it.  The first shipment, half the cans were dented.  I let it go and let them ship another shipment.  This time all the cans were dented!!  I contacted Amazon and they sent out a replacement shipment.  I also made mention of the poor packaging.  The replacement cans were all dented as well.  Last I checked at the local store, those were all dented too.  I wonder if it is an issue from the manufacturer but either way, beware that you may get dented cans!!

review/summary: Great herbal tea
review/text: I grew up on lipton black tea, brewed for hours, no sugar, no lemon... as Dad would say, "it'll put hair on your chest".  This (and the other Teavana products that I've tried) are certainly no Lipton.  The strawberry lemonade is great as an iced tea, although the fruit expands quite a bit, so you may want to split the dried product into two tea balls (I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RIZ7">Stainless Steel Mesh Tea Ball</a>x2), for a 2qt pitcher.  It also pairs well with oolong, roobios or green tea... friends have tried it with black and white teas, but I'm not a fan. You can definitely taste the different fruit flavors, and the rosehips give a nice scent but it doesn't taste like you're chewing on flowers.  Happy drinking!

review/summary: Almost like a meal
review/text: Avid readers of my reviews may recall that me and my mother used to consume voluptuous quantities of candy and snacks while watching the Eurovision Song Contest and related shows.<br /><br />I'm sure you wonder *what* candy we were consuming.<br /><br />Well, here's one. Amen to Anthon Berg! This brand of chocolate is Danish, and has been approved by the Danish royal court, although it's unclear whether the Queen of Denmark actually eats it herself. If she isn't, she's missing out!<br /><br />We are talking huge chocolate cakes filled with jam and marzipan. I think there are currently four different flavours. For some reason, I don't like the strawberry flavour, but I love the plum, apricot and cherry versions. (This is the plum flavour.) Frankly, these chocolates are so huge, you could skip a meal by eating just one box. Even I think an entire box is a bit extreme, and I'm a candyholic!<br /><br />Who won that contest, by the way? ;-)

review/summary: Yummy Boozy Christmas Candy !
review/text: We are from Europe so our chocolate / Christmas candy tastes differs from many in America.  BUT here is the scoop on this candy.  Plum jam infused with liquor is wrapped in Marzipan, (a paste made out of finally ground almonds, sugar and cream).  The whole thing is dipped in dark chocolate. This is an exquisite treat, pricy yet worth it, this one time a year.  It is best nibbled and savored slowly.  If you have kids, you can let them have a few bites or even a whole 1 piece.  The alcohol content is not too high.  However, if you intend to scarf up the whole box by yourself, you may spend some time happily sitting UNDER the Christmas tree.  Ok, Ok, so it's only my friends and I who live under there,  (since it is our European costume to hang these and other boozy Christmas chocolates on the tree as part of the decorations).  So, give it a whirl!  Try a box and enjoy!

review/text: These seeds are awesome!!  I stopped in Kentucky on a recent trip and picked up the Dill Pickle flavored seeds.  I had never heard of this brand before--I don't think they are sold around this area.  I was pleasantly surprised that the dill pickle flavoring was perfect.  Sometimes it can be over the top, but these seeds were big, bold, had a yummy roasted flavor and there were not many "rejects".  I will be purchasing a case of these tasty treats to put me thru the lawn mowing season!!  Giant Sunflower Seeds are highly recommended!!

review/summary: Good seeds, but beware if you have a milk allergy
review/text: I've tried David, Spitz, and Biggs sunflower seeds before giving the Giants brand a try.  The seeds are large and the flavoring is not too intense or too light.  So the seeds taste good and are of a good quality.  I haven't noticed much in the way of plant debris or empty seeds.<br /><br />I must give this product four stars for two reasons:<br /><br />1. Unlike the Spitz seeds, you cannot reseal these bags after opening them.  Spitz uses resealable bags for their seeds.  Giants does not.  This means you have to eat the seeds quickly or else they will get stale.<br /><br />2. In this variety pack, several of the flavors use milk as an ingredient.  Specifically, the Zesty Italian, Dill Pickle, and Dakota Ranch flavors list milk as an ingredient.  The Dakota Ranch flavor also lists cheese as an ingredient.  There was no way of knowing this based on the product advertisement.  I tried the Zesty Italian flavor and now have a stomachache because of the milk ingredient.<br /><br />I had high hopes for these seeds.  They do taste good, but if you are allergic or sensitive to certain ingredients or wish to have a resealable bag, I would recommend Spitz over Giants, but Giants over Biggs and Biggs over David.

review/summary: perfect for baseball season!!!
review/text: I tried Giant brand seeds for the first time last year (in texas they are available in lots of convenience stores) and I was ADDICTED to them! I work with college baseball and Giant seeds became one more superstition during each game, big handful of seeds at the top of every inning, big wad of bubblegum in the bottom, and repeat. I love that they offer so many flavors (and unique, delicious ones too!!), my favorite are salt & pepper and dakota ranch (better than David brand ranch, ingredient list includes real buttermilk, cheese cultures, real spices, you get the picture), spicy garlic are pretty legit too!!! Also, the name should tell you what to expect as far as the size of these seeds, you'll be spoiled by their giant-ness and easy cracking, I know it's only out of desperation that I ever succumb to spitting any inferior seeds. I can't get through baseball season without a case of Giant seeds!!!

Overall a good sunflower seed, but I think the flavor coatings on David & Sons is much better.

These dried fellows are excellent.<br />I actually seperated the different types out to see just what I had and was amazed<br />that it was so many kinds, not just one or two or even three like many dried mixes.<br />My hint to you, is to reconstitute them in a red or white wine. Then after you use<br />the mushrooms in your recipe pour the left over liquid into what you are cooking.<br />I also take a couple and grate them as a coating for fish.<br />I truly enjoy this dried mushroom mix. These get FOUR STARS from me<br />because they don't beat fresh mushroom ever but, they are the best dried<br />mushrooms I can find.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002NYK7O">Premium Wild Mushroom Mix 4 oz.</a>

review/summary: Best "Chocolate milk" you can have
review/text: My three year old son loves this and drinks about three glasses a day.<br />We both have malnourishment issues so I try to make sure any food we eat<br />is as healthy as possible. This drink mix has made it possible for my son<br />to not need supplement in a pill form. It does not taste like Hershey syrup,<br />but my son doesn't mind because he has never had Hershey syrup. It is hard to dissolve in cold milk so I mix it with warm water first then add the dissolved "syrup" into the milk. I make it in a shaker cup and I make enough for at least one day and that works well. Oh and once it's open it needs to be kept in the refrigerator. You can buy it at Whole Foods and some Vitamin stores but it's cheaper on Amazon. We have been using this for about two years.

review/text: Hello! I agree that the fact that the can is not full is a waste of money and I think that they should fix that immediately.  The taste is different and maybe not so sweet like actual chocolate milk but that is why its good for the kids.  I have never used this with only water because its chocolate and it just seems gross! I always use 1 oz of water and mix the powder in and it completely dissolves then i add in the milk and mix it and my very very very picky fussy 2 year old son loves it!!!! He wont touch veggies no matter how i season them or cook them, he eats only a few fruits but not enough to satisfy the daily suggestions.  So this is quite a life saver for me! I have used it for my self not the kid version and i love it to although i have tasted this version as I taste most things before i give them to my son and it wasnt bad at all.  So the only complaint i have is that the can is not full and the amount of money spent on one can is really outrageous! FILL UP THE CAN AND MAKE IT WORTH THE MONEY YOU CHARGE US FOR IT!!!!

review/summary: best way to get my kid his veggies!
review/text: maybe this is just coincidence but since starting to regularly drink the wild berry amazing supergrass for kids, our 8 year old has slowly started to develop a taste for vegetables.  a couple of years ago he would only eat fruit but refused any veggies--particularly the green leafy kind that are so good for you.  not wanting him to just depend on multi-vitamins for complete nutrition, i found the amazing supergrass products and decided to give it a try.  it was a great decision.  the wild berry flavor was perfect for him because he liked the fruity taste.  because it is actual wheatgrass and veggies, the superfood powder does not completely dissolve like koolaid would--there's still a sediment that remains after you mix it with water.  i thought this might be a problem, but my son just chugged the whole thing and liked it.  needless to say we were delighted and kept giving it to him.  we still tried to make him try some veggies, and after he drank the superfood for awhile he became more amenable to it.  now he eats spinach, broccoli, onions, and carrots!  now i'd never make the crazy claim that this superfood will make a kid like veggies, but whether it was pure coincidence, acclimation to digesting or tasting the veggie "sediment" that is leftover, or psychological acceptance of ingesting vegetables and feeling perfectly fine--it worked!  we will continue to supplement his diet with this wild berry superfood.  as a parent i seriously couldn't be happier with it.

Since they are only 2 and 17 months old, lets just say they are less than pleased with all the veggies! So after finding this i gave it a try. I was shocked at how much they love it! The nice thing is that it has a great chocolate taste, they think they are getting chocolate milk everyday... which is just like a treat to them. I have noticed a vast improvement on they amount of energy they have and there immune system even seems stronger. I would greatly recommend this product for kids or adults. Getting your kids there greens has never been so easy, and prices you can't beat!

review/summary: I drink this every day
review/text: For close to 2 years now, I have been drinking this every morning.  When the entire family gets a cold, I still get it, but mine starts later, and ends before the rest of my family.  I have found that the powder needs to be mixed with a little bit of yogurt before adding milk.  It just doesn't dissolve in milk very well.  But does great in yogurt.  I used to get hungry by 10am and need to constantly snack until lunch.  But between the super food drink and maybe a muffin, I can eat lunch a little later (1:00 instead of 11:30).<br /><br />I know this is the kids version, but I enjoy the taste of this one so much more than either the chocolate or berry in the adult version.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it would be nice if Amazon would carry the larger 100 scoop size of this.

review/summary: this stuff is AMAZING!
review/text: I LOVE this stuff! it tastes great and is great for you(It tastes like chocolate milk and my kids will drink it without any fuss). The only downside (if it bothers you which it doesn't us) is it is a little harder to mix but that is due to the whole foods this makes it slightly thicker than regular chocolate milk also it settles pretty quickly so if it sets for long it needs to be re-stirred... but again is normal and expected with this type of quality whole foods

review/summary: My kids like it.
review/text: I have two children ages 5 & 6. They used to love fruits and veggies until they got subjected to undesirable eating habits at school and outside our home.  Suddenly the broccoli, bananas, apples, whole milk (only wants chocolate now, thanks public schools!) and whole wheat bread WITH crust on it became a daily struggle at our house. They learned that many kids get away with being a picky eater and now it's war at our house.  They now try and demand crust to be cut off sandwiches.  Won't do it. They ask for Koolaid and sugary juice boxes.  It's a fight for a moment until they realize they're not going to win. (Makes me want to homeschool at times or raise my kids in some kind of African village far away from civilization!) Our kids get their fair share of junk food but this culture is innodated by sugar and unhealthy foods at every turn, in everything down to "healthy" kids yogurts. I got desperate to find something like a health shake for them to supplement what they're not getting..  I had read the reviews on Amazing Grass for Kidz and thought I would try it out. Because our rule is that they need to try something once, they loved it.  Matter of fact, wanted seconds right away.  We make it with banana and milk to make it into a shake. Now, they get one everyday.  And, watch out, it helps with their bowel movements. ;)  I'm happy to have found something like this and had friends buy it for their kids.  My husband and I bought the adult version of the same thing.  I'M SOLD!  It's still a struggle to get them to eat as healthy as we would like but I'm happy to know they are getting some of what they're missing in this powder.

review/summary: Mommy, I don't like chocolate milk!
review/text: My kid loves chocolate milk. Or did until I got this, thinking I could sneak some veggies into that little stomach of his.  Mixed it up, didn't tell him I had made the swap and handed it to his little smiling face.  He ran away, came back and gave me a full glass back, telling me it was "icky".  Later, out of the blue he declared "mommy, I don't like chocolate milk!" I'm now trying to figure out how I can sneakily hide this stuff in other foods until I get rid of it.  Maybe chocolate cake?<br /><br />If it tastes as bad as it smells, I can't blame the poor guy.<br /><br />I also do agree that the packaging is terribly wasteful.

review/text: I have to put this in a travel cup for my 5 year old or else he won't drink it.  He is too use to the smooth and chocolate colored chocolate milk.  It turns milk into a greenish cast and no matter how you mix it, it is a bit gritty but it does taste good.  I think its worth it for the benefits but when it comes to young ones, the way it looks matters the most.  It might just be my son but he totally thinks greenish milk is not cool (maybe because he associates it with veggies that he doesn't like).  I will still purchase it in the future because the positives out way any negatives.

A lot of chocolate Carnation Instant Breakfast had to be added to get him to drink it.

review/summary: Love it!!!
review/text: I've tried many diff kinds of green powder and had to choke it down by mixing it with a strong flavored juice. It would defeat the purpose! All these nutrients in a processed sugary juice.  No good.  So i decided to get this chocolate flavor at whole foods... to my surprise it blended very well in a smoothie with only a HINT of a green taste.  Oddly enough, when mixed with milk it has zero after taste and actually tastes quite like chocolate milk.  It tastes more like an ovaltine than a nestle quick. But if kids don't know the difference they should take to this pretty well!  The key is to dissolve in water first then add the milk.  I've been adding to almond milk and drinking it right up without having to have a "chaser."  Today I mixed with a half a scoop of "super seed" fiber (also purchased on amazon) and threw in some hemp seeds with almond milk and it tastes great! Like chocolate covered nuts.  Really enjoyed it and will be using this method to get in my daily vegetable intake.  I also would like to mention the amazon price is most definitely the best deal-- especially when you do subscribe and save. 5 stars!

review/summary: Great nutrititious drink for kids
review/text: I bought both the Berry and Chocolate drinks for daughter; however, she preferred the berry since it is sweeter.  I love the facts that it has a rainbow selection of vegetables and fruits some of which my daughter doesn't like to eat like spinach and sprouts.  Like another reviewer, I am also not thrilled with the fact that the powder drink contains "Natural flavor" which could mean msg.  When I approached a sale person at a major health food grocery store, he didn't even know what natural flavor is.  Since we ran out of the powder, I am hesistant to buy this same drink and feed my daughter because of the "Natural Flavor" ingredient.  It will be while until I find a good wholesome powder drink for my daughter since originally I planned to replace this drink with her vitamins' intake.  I give 3 1/2 stars since it has the natural flavor ingredient.

I hadn't had it for awhile so i wasn't sure if i had the old or the new flavor and this concerned me....no need! This is just a tasty and wonderful as i remember it. I have been feeling sluggish recently and thought i would supplement my diet with this drink. This is a great way to get those fruits and veges you miss in your diet. Will order this again and again! Great flavor and dissolves easily in a little water first before adding milk.

review/summary: It's ok
review/text: This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn't seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I've read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don't mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet.

I recommend mixing a scoop with a small amount of water before adding the milk in to ensure the powder dissolves well.  It's great because my 4 yr old son does not like to eat fruits and veggies so this sort of helps supplement his diet given the fact that the powder is a blended mixture of fruits/veggies (he does not know this!)  I have a recurring (every 2 months) order for this product.

Also, as another reviewer mentioned, the can is half empty, which I think is deceptive marketing.

I usually add some Trader Joe's vanilla protein powder to add some nutritional weight to them. You could also toss in some chocolate chunks for a treat.<br /><br />I don't know what's up with the "charging for flavor" review. That's not really a review of the product but rather a review of the price. Anyway, this is a good value.

review/text: Although these muffins are not the best instant muffins out there, they can be prepared with just adding 1/2 cup of water, which makes them a necessity to have around the house when you have run out of milk (or have noticed that the milk's expired) but still need to make something for breakfast/snack time!<br /><br />The banana flavor is a little weak, so I either add mashed bananas to the batter and bake it as a loaf, or add banana extract to try and punch up the flavor a bit.<br /><br />Note that one package only makes 6 muffins.

review/summary: Charging for Flavor
review/text: How come Blueberry now (2011) cost more then Banana Nut or Chocolate Chip. It is the same product , the same company and the same size, the only difference is the flavor. Customers should not have to pay extra for a different flavor.  Were do Amazon get this from.<br />This is like charging $.50 for a pack of tropical punch Kool-aid, $.40 for a pack of orange, and $.30 for a pack of Wild Berry, mind you that it is all the same size.  What is this?, is it that Blueberry taste better then Banana Nut? So Amazon is charging for the flavor. What the Hey? Amazon gets to say which flavor is better.<br />This is like saying Coke is better then Pepsi, this is not for Amazon to decide.

review/summary: A Bit Too Oily
review/text: Considering that many of the Terra chips are healthier versions of snack foods, it was surprising that these chips were so oily. They have more oil listed on the package than what Amazon actually stated when I bought them. I was disappointed in the overall crunch of these chips. They are a bit too thick to be a true kettle chip and though crunchy, it isn't quite what I expected. They aren't bad, just not really as advertised. Those who like a thick, nearly unsalted chip will enjoy these.

review/text: I really like these chips! They are nice and crunchy. They are not oversalted (to my taste, anyhow). I think that the taste is richer than standard potato chips. Take a look at the "nutrition facts" on the back. One is not overdosing on salt here (one serving=5% of daily value). Saturated fat is 5%. Compare with Wise's standard potato chips: 7% salt and 15% saturated fat.<br /><br />All in all, a rich taste and perhaps a bit better fotr you than other standard brands.

review/text: These chips are great.  Strangely enough I was a bit overwhelmed by the fact that they have a strong actual potato taste.  Though of course that's a good thing in chips, but I have never tasted any other chips like these. You simply can not compare these to chips like Lay's or other national brands.  They are just salt and pepper and potato.  You don't taste grease or manufactured flavors.  They are crispy, but NOT hard to chew or too crunchy.  totally perfect.  Buy them, but be prepared to eat way too much.  Though one complaint that I didn't have - someone who tried them wished they had more pepper.  But I think they are perfect as is.

Not so.  They were repackaged by Amazon in a box designed for ten bags.  The case consisted of 12 bags.  No problem for the packer as he just squeezed in the two extra bags.  You can imagine what that does to potato chips.  I now have 6 bags of whole chips and 6 bags of chip pieces which can be eaten with a spoon.

review/summary: Instant Oatmeal is Now a Staple
review/text: Quaker Oats have been a staple in my family for generations. It was the only oatmeal that my maternal grandmother prepared, although she always used the Old Fashioned Oatmeal that was actually cooked (and added real sugar, not sweetner, and whole milk for the best oats I ever ate). If she were alive today, I know she would have tried Quaker Instant Oatmeal in the packets. Prepared according to package directions, the oatmeal comes out smooth with no lumps. I found the brown sugar taste more than acceptable, but as usual with maple flavor I don't find it authentic, and there was a bit of an aftertaste. Each packet is one serving, which I don't find sufficient for a whole breakfast, so adding toast and fruit, or bacon or sausage on the side makes for a meal that will stay with you for more than an hour or two. The packets are convenient for campers, hikers, vacationers, or office workers as they do not take up much room, and can be prepared quickly where hot water is available. And they can be eaten just plain, without milk, and still be a  quick meal or snack.

review/summary: Excellent for what it is
review/text: I used to eat a lot of this when I first "discovered" the pleasure of oatmeal about a year ago. Now, I make my own using Quaker's "Old Fashioned Oats," (or Target's cheaper equivalent), which takes only 10 minutes or so, allows me to control the sweetness to my liking by adding the maple syrup and brown sugar myself, and doesn't give me any "artificial flavors" or "guar gum," or "caramel color."<br /><br />Given that, I will say that, for an instant product, this is pretty good, though just a bit too sweet for me. Its first ingredient is Whole Grain Rolled Oats (although the second is sugar) and it does have a reasonably creamy consistency which you would expect from oatmeal. I actually preferred Quaker's high fiber variation of this product, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MWASW6">Quaker Instant Oatmeal, High Fiber, Maple Brown Sugar, 12.6-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>. I think that one is a little less sweet than this one and the 10 grams of fiber is an attraction if you're trying (like I am) to get more fiber into your diet.<br /><br />It's absurd to compare this to "old fashioned" or "steel cut" oatmeal. This is a convenience product that requires no preparation and which you would use when you don't have the time or inclination to fuss with the others. It should be evaluated (and consumed) with this in mind.

review/summary: Oatmeal with maple brown sugar ~ not sugar with a little oatmeal
review/text: I am one of those people who believes that the predominant taste of any kind of oatmeal should be the oatmeal and not whatever the added flavoring might be.  This Quaker product has a subtle aroma of maple and a hint of sweetness that enhances rather than overwhelms the oatmeal.  I did not find it at all artificial and there was no strange after taste.  My preference is always for longer cooking oats but busy mornings are not always conducive.  The consistency seems better when cooked in the microwave as opposed to pouring boiling water.  For a quick and healthy breakfast or snack, this is a good option.

Unfortunately, I haven't tried the "old" recipe so I can't make a comparison. The box I received says "Classic Recipe" so it may be that they have gone back to the old recipe? I'm not sure.<br /><br />I made this oatmeal with milk and found it to average. I don't mind eating it but I've had better. Even though sugar is second on the ingredient list, I didn't think that this oatmeal had a very sweet taste. I could just barely taste brown sugar and I couldn't taste a maple flavor at all. If I'm going to eat something with a lot of added sugar then I want it to taste sweet! This was very filling and kept me full until lunch time.

review/text: Quaker Instant Oatmeal Maple Brown Sugar is a staple item in our household.  It allows for versatility, since you can eat it alone, as well as with nuts and/or fruit mixed in.  One of my favorite things to do is to add raisins and pecans!  In addition, it is a practical item to take to work when you can't have breakfast at home and fix it in a coffee mug in the microwave during a break.  I prefer to have it with milk, but it is very good when fixed with water too.  It is also a very nutritious breakfast that may reduce cholesterol, help with digestion, and reduce the risk of heart disease - and it only has 160 calories per serving if prepared with water!  I highly recommend it!

review/text: As far as instant products go, Quaker Instant Oatmela Maple Brown Sugar flavor is pretty tasty.  It's also pretty instant and fills you up, even if you need to eat two packets at a time to actually feel full.  However, it's not something you have to feel guilty about eating since it's oatmeal and the fat/calories in a serving aren't going to crash your diet.  Unlike all the complainers, I'm not addicted to the "original" flavor and honestly couldn't tell you there was a difference between this and the "old" version.  Basically, if you don't eat it five days a week, you probably won't notice the difference.<br /><br />Overall I like the texture of this as well.  I tend to make mine straight from the packet and with boiling water from an electric kettle and sometimes I've had products that don't mix well that way and I'm stuck eating crunchy oats instead of, well, the proper gooey kind.  This one does exactly what I want with the texture most of the time and I absolutely love it!  Hard to feel guilty about something that's good for you and tastes pretty darn good too, definitely still solid product from Quaker.

review/summary: That Awesome Homemade Just Almost Like Your Mama Makes!
review/text: This is the most impressive, right down to the soul, just almost like your Mama used to make! Makes you want to eat more! The Richness of the Maple is there but yet is not overwhelming and likewise the sweetness of that Brown Sugar compliments it fully; it just cannot be beat! Had given this to my grandchildren who HATES oatmeal, without even saying what it was - and they wanted MORE not even knowing what it was. This is all good for you, with genuine Oats, added additional dietry needs with just a touch of sweetness and all the home-goodness makes it all irresitable!

review/summary: I'm just an old-fasioned oatmeal kind of gal
review/text: Although a snap to prepare, this just isn't for me.  Most of all it's too sweet.  It also contains too many ingredients.  I prefer making my oatmeal the slow way, controlling the amount of sweetness and without all the additives.

review/text: well, first thing's for everything, right? This is my first review, and also my first time purchasing food items online. at first I didn't even think about the possibility up until now. i've always bought electronics and such on amazon. but I definitely made the right choice buying oatmeal from amazon directly. my family is almost done with all four boxes, so I may definitely come back and purchase more from amazon. they also had it at $12 at the time! that beats alot of competitors on this site straight up who is also selling oatmeal. you won't be disappointed with this purchase. now that just leaves me with the next choice: Brown sugar dinosaur oatmeal, or apple struedel flavored pop tarts? decisions, decisions...

review/summary: Quaker has taken themselves out of the instant oats market
review/text: I love oatmeal, and occasionally make steel-cut oatmeal in my ricemaker, but I've been eating more Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar Instant Oatmeal - for years.  Pallets of it.  Literally, I had bought lots of "value pack" 24-packs the last time they went on sale at Shop Rite, and when I finally ran out, a couple months ago, I bought the "new" improved package at Stop & Shop.<br /><br />The new flavor is horrible - not just compared to the original, or to McCanns, but truly horrible.  I couldn't finish it.  Tasted a little like coffee grounds.  Even adding brown sugar or a little milk didn't change it at all.<br />How could you screw up a decades old favorite like that?  Why not offer it as a new product, and leave your loyal customer's with their proven favorites?  (Why didn't Coca-Cola just release "New Coke" in the '80s, instead of screwing up their brand loyalty?  And why didn't Quaker learn from Coke?)<br /><br />Since then, I've been buying the Stop & Shop brand, and it's not bad.  Not as good as the original Quaker Oats Maple & Brown Sugar, but good enough.  Quaker has effectively removed themselves from the instant oatmeal market, in my opinion.  Hope they correct their mistake, but I don't think that happens very often.  I'll be waiting for one of those "We heard you, and we're making it right" commercials... Until then, it's store-brand oats for me.
