review/summary: Excellent Tomatoes - Bad Shipping
review/text: Bionaturae Organic Tomatoes are excellent. The problem was not with the tomatoes however, but the shipping.  The cans arrived dented, some badly, and that is not acceptable. It would seem reasonable to expect that Amazon would ship these cans in a way that would preserve their integrity.<br /><br />I love these tomatoes, however if the shipping of said product remains the same as it is now, the damage sustained is not worth the risk involved.  Badly dented cans are not for me!<br /><br />I have ordered canned foods directly from Eden Organic Foods and they arrived in pristine condition.  Perhaps Amazon could contact Eden for proper procedures on shipping on canned products.<br /><br />Let's hope Amazon is paying attention to complaints posted by those of us who have ordered and received damaged cans.

review/summary: the next best thing to fresh tomatoes
review/text: the ingredients are simple and pure and one of the few brands that does not add unnecessary additives. Generally I like to make my own sauce from scratch, but this is my second choice if I am short on time. Its taste good and not artificially sweet. I love the bionaturae products including the tomato paste.

review/summary: Great Tomatoes
review/text: Pros<br />-Great Taste<br />-Always Fresh<br />-Fair Price compared to stores<br /><br />Cons<br />-Cans were dented<br /><br />Like another review said, the cans seemed dented from shipping.  It wasn't anything major like being busted open or can't use a can opener on them.  Most just had a dent on the side from being pressed up against the other cans.  I still gave it five stars because I don't think it is that important for the cans to look perfect, just so long as they work.

review/text: I love this stuff. I like anything peach -- ice cream, yogurt, pie -- and this has a really nice peach flavor. It's hard to find this variety in my local stores, and when I can find it, it's nearly as expensive as it is here at Amazon ($4.59 per box locally vs $4.62 from the least expensive seller here, including shipping), so I don't feel too guilty ordering here.  I mix up a quart at a time, and usually go through two of those per day. Very yummy!

review/text: I have been looking for years for a flavoring for water and have found. I love this stuff and at only 5 calories I get the hydration I need with a great taste.  Only problem is that I am having trouble finding this flavor in Florida. So when I travel to NJ I load up a carry on from the local A&P and bring it back to Florida. If you need to drink a lot of water try this product.

review/summary: My every day green tea
review/text: I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays "NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays "CAFFENE FREE".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.

review/summary: All I Could Want in A Taco Shell...
review/text: We eat tacos at least once a week.  I have ordered many different taco shells online.  Most have at least one or two broken shells in every box.  HOWEVER, Old El Paso Taco Shells always come perfect.  I have yet to have any broken shells when I order these shells.  Also, I think they taste better than most corn taco shells.  Also, they are a nice size taco shells.  Most other taco shells come unusually small.  I highly recommend these taco shells to anyone who enjoys their Tex Mex.

review/summary: Great size for a taco shell
review/text: I'm not commenting on the shipping because you're probably wondering how these taste as opposed to thinking of eating the shipping box.<br /><br />In brief, for pre-made taco shells, they're great. They taste just like all the other pre-made shells (crispy, and best warmed in the microwave before use) so if you like corn tortillas and don't want the mess of cooking them yourself theses should work well for you.<br /><br />The best part is that they're also large enough to hold the meat and toppings without having to fight the shell as you spoon in tiny little amounts of lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion, salsa, etc. I find the regular sized ones a little small and it's a struggle sometimes to build a great taco.<br /><br />Tip - if you use a ready made seasoning mix, you might try the Rick Bayless mixes if you can find them. I tried it and found it surprisingly good; far better than most of the dry seasoning pouches. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't carry them right now.

review/text: I was hesitant to start mixing flavors so soon, but ran out of regular food while on family vacation recently. My husband grabbed this for our baby (7 months old) and I thought, oh great - this is going to suck. Well, it didn't - the baby gobbled this up the first time and every time we feed him this flavor. Even though I try to do all organic, this is one I happily make an exception for because he loves it so much. I appreciate that Gerber really is making the effort to provide healthy, good quality, affordable options for baby's developing palates.

Seems that along with a new look to their box art (white box now), Post has decided to advertise that it has given its customers bigger berries.  That's great you say.  But when you pour out the contents into a separate container you'll be shocked to learn that you have approximately 25% less cereal by volume.  Guess those bigger berries were needed to bring the weight back up to the same heft as last year's product.  Good thing they didn't raise the price, huh?  Guess I'll be looking for another product.  Too bad Post.  You really didn't think we'd notice?

review/text: I have used this seasoning packet on duck, pork, but mainly for roast chicken, for years. I rub the dry mix all over a whole fryer chicken, stick it in the fridge overnight, and roast the next day in the oven or outside on the grill. Letting it "marinate" overnight gets the flavors all through the meat. Tasty and juicy, the way Chinese Roast chicken is supposed to be. The directions state to mix the seasoning with water, but I've found using it as a dry rub works best for me if I'm roasting. Definitely mix with water if putting it in the crock-pot. Delicate, slightly sweet Chinese five spice flavor. Would I recommend? Absolutely!

review/summary: Easy to digest, nice neutral flavor
review/text: It is possible that most people are looking for mung beans to sprout but we cook ours. They were first recommended to me by two very helpful clerks in an Indian grocery store in Knoxville TN as being very easy to digest so I bought a package to try.  Indeed they are.  They also taste pretty good!<br /><br />Mung beans need very little soaking and cook much faster than most dried beans so they are handy to have on hand. There are a lot of recipes on line for these beans. Some call for the hulled yellow split ones, but I always use these whole green beans.  Our personal favorite recipe is from a small Indian cookbook I have. It calls for topping the cooked and gently flavored beans with "crisp fried onions" which are simply very thinly sliced onions fried in hot oil until they are brown but not burned (a bit tricky to do).  The fried onions provide a good unhealthy (but very tasty) balance to the incredibly healthy beans........Sorry.......I had to say that.<br /><br />Seriously:  We have found all of the Bob's Red Mill products we've used to be very good quality.  These Bob's Red Mill beans are more expensive than those from the Indian grocery store but I don't have to drive 70 miles to get them either! Once you have tried a single package of a specialty item and like it, it is great to be able to stay home, use no gasoline, and get a case lot order from Amazon!

review/summary: best vanilla frappe out there
review/text: When I worked as a barista, this was what we used, and it's excellent! You have to know how to mix it, which may've been the issue with the other reviewer. There's not much coffee in the mix, so it's easy to make it as strong as you want.<br /><br />Hot: Mix with hot (hotter the better) milk or coffee. You can mix in blender or, if you have a pro-type steamer, you can use that (but make sure to mix powder with the liquid a bit first).<br /><br />Cold: In your glass, fill with ice cubes. Add any liquid to the glass until it's about 3/4 full (you can add cold milk, cold coffee, extra flavours, or a mix). Add the powder to the blender -- about 1 scoop for a smaller sized drink, two for a large. Add your liquid & ice mix from your cup. Blend on low speed for about 20 seconds, then high until you get the consistency you want.

review/summary: A Hard-To-Find Treat
review/text: As a kid, I grew up eating unfrosted brown sugar cinnamon Pop Tarts and I still love them to this day.  They are almost impossible to find on store shelves because it seems people only want the overly sweet frosted varieties.  I snatch these up whenever I can find them.

review/summary: Hard to Find Pop-Tarts!
review/text: Believe it or not, I bought a case of unfrosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts as a Christmas gift! I couldn't find these in ANY grocery store in my area, so I was thrilled to see I could order these from Amazon grocery. There was a glitch with my order; instead of getting a whole case I only received one box. In a panic, I emailed customer service, and within a few days I had the other 11 boxes. The recipient of this gift was so happy! (she's not in to the frosted pop tarts). Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Heaven in a box
review/text: I love, love, love unfrosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts.  It has to the be unfrosted.  I can't stand that<br />hard, crusty frosting on all their other flavors.  It's the only flavor I will buy, and I could eat it everyday.<br />Unfortunately, finding a store who still carries it is becoming more and more like searching for the Holy Grail.<br />The last Wal-Mart in my city just stopped carrying them, and I almost cried.  Scotts and Kroger discontinued them<br />long ago.<br />What's up with you people?  Bring it back!  I would drive 20 miles out of my way to find it.  Now it looks like<br />I'll be ordering it strictly online from now on.  Very bad marketing, Kellogs!

review/text: Like most other posters, I loved these pop tarts as a kid and I would love to have them again.  I don't like the frosted so I haven't bought in a very long time.  I just wish you could order a smaller amount (maybe pack of 6) instead of instead of 12.  Those would last me forever and would end up being wasted.  I do enjoy them but can't see buying a case of them.

review/summary: Be Still My Taste Buds!
review/text: You know how sometimes you remember something from your childhood and when you try it again as an adult it just doesn't quite live up to your memory?  Well...these DO! These were my all time favorite pop-tarts as a kid and I think the only flavor I ate.  When they started frosting them I stopped eating them because I just hate the frosting.  I don't think I've had one in 20 to 30 years.  Anyway, they taste EXACTLY the way I remember them.  I can't believe I had to buy a case to get them, but I'm sending some to my siblings and actually have some friends who are buying a few off of me.  Mine arrived well packaged and undamaged and the expiration date is about 9 months away.  If you loved these as a kid...go for it!

To the poster who complained that they are not frosted, I guess you did not read the box, the frosted ones say frosted right on it.

Thanks to Amazon.com I now have a way to stock up on one of my most favorite flavor without the NASTY frosting. I shall be a fan for a long,long time! The only topping unfrosted brown-sugar cinamon ever needed, in my opinion, was melted butter.

But, only when it comes to the unfrosted Brown Sugar Cinnamon.<br />I see a lot of folks have mentioned they're hard to find. Only place I've been able to find them is at the Walmart here in our area (Cedar Park, TX). H.E.B., Randall's, Super S, a lot of other grocery stores don't carry them for some reason - they carry everything else, but not these. (?)<br />Oddly enough, whenever I get the chance to get by the Walmart, they're overstocked with all the other flavors and these are nearly all bought up. Yumm...time to go get some.

review/summary: MY FAVORITE POP TARTS IN THE WORLD
review/text: BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON POP TARTS<br /><br />Why, oh, why is it so hard to find this flavor of pop tart?  And why do stores only stock the frosted brown sugar cinnamon pop tarts?<br /><br />I have been a fan of this flavor pop tarts since they were first invented which was a looong time ago.  Nothing beats sticking these into the toaster, just getting them a little bit warm, and then spreading a very thin portion of butter on them.  Serve with ice cold milk -- skim, of course -- and you are in for a taste treat!  Your taste buds will thank you.<br /><br />I only wish more grocery stores would stock the au natural brown sugar flavor.  Frosting isn't everything!<br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br />Pam

They're even cheaper than I used to get them for and they taste fresher! I've ordered this bulk box twice now and both times have been very pleased.

review/text: I thought my favorite Poptarts were discontinued and gone forever until I recently saw them in a grocery store in town.  Apparently it was a one time deal because after that they were gone again.  I was surfing the net and googled it and up it popped.  Ordered a case to be delivered every 6 months which is perfect because I am the only one who eats them and the expiration date on the box indicates they will be good even after the next shipment is due.  The case came shipped in another box with protective packaging to limit any cracking of the tarts.  I am thrilled to have this slice of my childhood again.

review/summary: Excellent and versitile tea
review/text: I've been drinking Yellow Label Tea since the 80's. This is an excellent and versitile tea, makes for a good hot tea and also a refreshing iced tea. A bit stronger than regular "brisk lipton" tea typically found in the U.S. I used to have to wait until I traveled to the British Virgin Islands or the Bahamas to find this tea, but now it's on Amazon (darn, my excuses to travel are dwindling!). This is an Orange Pekoe tea in 200g bags. You can find different varieties of tea marked with the "Lipton Yellow Label" brand, usually loose leaf teas. For instance I have a Sri Lanka-packed metal tin of "Pure Ceylon," a box of "Coarse Black Tea" packed in Mumbai, and another "new bright & rich" Mumbai variety which is a blend of "Assam teas." These other varieties can be found in middle eastern, Indian, and Asian markets here in the US. All good teas, but this Orange Pekoe in the bags is the most convenient and has the smoothest flavour.

review/text: Traveling world wide, I've come to much prefer good tea to bad coffee, and good teas are so much more common.<br /><br />Yellow Label is one of the most popular teas in the world because it has a rich, clean flavor without bitterness.  Its clear distinctive red color makes it also one of the prettiest.  The only supermarket teas I've found in the US that taste similar are the "English Breakfast" labels.  If you like these, or like strong black tea flavor without the bitterness or muddiness of overbrewing the usual black teas, you should try Yellow Label.

review/summary: A Favorite with Many
review/text: I first enjoyed Yellow Label in the Caribbean 20 yrs ago and have since in travels worldwide been looked at oddly at groceries as I purchased 20 boxes to take home. There it was only tea, in the US it wasn't available...or oddly in London which appears on the label.  A letter to Lipton 6 years ago gave no explanation for not marketing in the US, just "coupons to try our other brands".  Finally, Amazon has it and even better a market in Chinatown here in NYC.<br />What makes it great?  It's the only black tea that is full flavored but not bitter.  It's so smooth that you literally can make a pot of it, leave the bags in, reheat it the next day and still have no bitterness.  This is a tea lover's tea that I have turned numerous travel companions onto for life and something I would be lost without.

review/summary: The smoothest tea.......
review/text: I was first given a box of this Yellow Label from a co-worker who had traveled to China.  I instantly fell in love with the smooth flavor.  I found it in a Food Max in Stockton, Ca but then the store closed down.  I have been on a search for the last two months because my loose leaf is almost gone also.  I was brewing the tea for the staff in my office and they all love it, so when I ran out of tea bags they all wanted to know where I got the tea from.  The flavor is so smooth that you almost do not need any type of sweetner at all.  This should be made available in the states in at least one major grocery store.  I am buying enough to share with my friends.....

review/summary: Does not taste like Lipton Yellow Label tea sold in Italy, possibly stale, no expiration date on pkg.
review/text: This is a repeat of the same review I left for another Amazon listing for the same tea (but at a significantly different price).  Despite the price difference, both listings appear to be for the same item and are sold by the same Indian Grocery.  From reading the other reviews, it is clear that at least one other customer had the same bad experience as I did.<br /><br />I was initially excited to find Lipton Yellow Label Tea on Amazon, as I just got back from Italy and fell in love with it there.  The Lipton Yellow Label Tea in Italy doesn't taste anything like the weak, poor-quality Lipton we get in the U.S., but the tea I ordered on Amazon (sold by Simply Beautiful) is actually manufactured for India and tastes bitter and/or stale.  You can't see from the photo, but the writing on the packages I received is not in English and says it was manufactured in Canada for India.  It is hard to tell whether the variety sold in India just tastes different than the kind in Italy, or if the tea was in fact stale, because there is NO sell-by or expiration date on the package (very disturbing), and the bags are NOT "foil-wrapped for freshness" as described on Amazon.  I was extremely disappointed in the taste of this tea from India, having looked forward to the lovely, full-bodied Lipton Yellow Label tea bags that I brought home from Italy.  Not to mention the fact that I would never want to buy imported groceries that don't have an expiration date, so there is no way to know how long they've been sitting in the warehouse, if they are stale, or when they will go stale after opening (especially since they are not individually wrapped).  I returned both boxes of tea and hope to get an Amazon refund soon.  I am very bummed.

review/text: The Lipton Yellow Label tea is a step above the "regular" Lipton sold here in the States. This is your basic, everyday black tea but it is much more flavorful and bolder than the Lipton variety sold in supermarkets here. It brews a good, bracing cup of tea. I recommend it over the supermarket variety any day. I have used this to make iced tea as well and while it's good over ice, it is best served hot.

review/summary: good tea
review/text: I must echo the praise of Lipton Yellow Label tea.<br /><br />I don't know how this label may differ across countries, but recently I spent several month-long trips to Pakistan, where Lipton Yellow Label is pretty much all the black tea they serve, and tea is served all the time.  After getting around the initial shock of their custom of putting up to four teabags into 16 ounces of water there, I came to like the Yellow Label tea.  Then when switching a few times to Twinings tea at the hotel business center, I realized that Yellow Label is much better than all the tea I'd been drinking heretofore.  Comparing Yellow Label to other Litpons, other tea available in America, and even Twinings, which I considered the top of the heap, Yellow Label was clearly better.  A Pakistani friend who travels to the U.S. says that American tea is "insipid" and refuses to drink it.  I now agree, and think that Lipton Yellow Tea is the best tea I have ever had.  Now I've got to figure out where to buy it.  As far as I'm concerned, Yellow Label is the tea most worth drinking, which no doubt accounts for its popularity in Pakistan.

review/text: This is a brand of orange pekoe black tea that is drunk all over the world. Lipton sells it in many countries, and while the product might have the same smooth, almost inoffensive base note, to me the UK version tastes very different than the Indian version, which is perceptable stronger and has a more "citrusy" note. While it doesn't hold up to some premium orange pekoe teas, it is distinctly better than the Lipton tea available in US supermarkets.

I had arrived in Nagoya for a meeting, and had time to  wonder around a market...really just rubber-necking.<br /><br />I bought the familiar Lipton label as well as several other teas.

review/text: I've been buying primarily whole leaf, oolong, pu'er, jasmine teas from a wholesale tea market in Beijing (Malian St). Though the price is far cheaper than the Ten  Fu (Ten Ren) teas and other retailers, the discernment in quality seemed questionable. I am a simpleton concerning tea. So rather than purchase $90/kg for the base Assam tea, I went to Carre4 and bought an under $5/box of Lipton Yellow label Black tea 100 bags for the consistant quality.

review/text: After running out of my usual every-day tea, Trader Joe's brand of "Irish Breakfast Tea," I found this Yellow Label first at my local Chinese supermarket in the tea aisle. I had only had the "brisk" version before and wasn't such a Lipton fan, but I needed tea and bought it.<br /><br />Contrary to the rather dusty, mild (watery??) taste of the "brisk" American version, Yellow Label has a good flavor and no bitterness, even when brewing for 6 min (I brew a small pot with three bags in the morning). Not quite as rich as Assam tea when mixed with milk and sugar, but a good substitute. And you can't beat the price. A very nice, full every-day tea.

review/text: I was born and raised in New Orleans. I have been a coffee lover as soon as I could drink from a cup! My great-grandmother would give it to me with lots of milk in it. Anyway, I have been through all of them all...back and forth... Community, CDM, Luzianne, French Market (red label), Union, PJ's...I even tried different types of pure coffee and adding my own chicory. I prefer the French Market Restaurant Blend. This one was introduced to me at a seafood restaurant called Coffee's Boiling Pot in Madisonville, LA. I love it. For me, it has the right blend of coffee and chicory (not hickory as some reviewer complained!) Of course,I wish the whole beans were available so that I could grind it myself.Anyway,it's a personal preference. Try it. If you don't like it, send it to me. I'll gladly drink it!

Of course, if you've visited New Orleans, you know what I mean.  I use this for about every third pot,just for that wake up.  Yet, it could be daily,it's that good. The other major brand?  Well, I doubt that you'd find much difference.  If you try both at once, let us know.<br /><br />Now, if only Amazon could ship fresh beignets.  Well, I see they do have mixes; so if you're ambitious, go at it.

review/summary: MUCH Better Than Coffee
review/text: I was introduced to medium roast 'C&C' (Coffee and Chicory) when<br />we went to breakfast at Stanley's in the French Quarter and I was<br />hooked.  (Most days I am choking down the last of my Maxwell House<br />so it doesn't go to waste but I'm counting the days til it's all gone.)<br />The medium roast C&C is much smoother than regular coffee and I<br />don't taste any bitterness at all.<br /><br />French Market's medium roast Restaurant Blend (white can) is awesome.<br />It says on the plastic lid to use 1/3 to 1/2 as much as regular coffee<br />(so a 1-pound can is the equivalent of a 2-pound can of coffee).  Based<br />on my experience, using only 1/3 wouldn't be enough - a 1/2 is better.<br /><br />One bit of advice I can give to those who add milk or cream to their<br />coffee - don't try adding milk or cream until the color matches what<br />you had with coffee or it'll be weakened too much.  The C&C will be<br />darker with the 'right' amount of milk or cream.<br /><br />As I write this Amazon's page says it's not available but I found it's<br />available directly from French Market [...]<br />for $7 a 1-pound can ($1 less if you order 12 cans or more).  I plan<br />on handing out cans as Christmas gifts.

I've bought and enjoyed different brands over the years: Luzianne, both regular and premium; Cafe du Monde; and French Market. But this French Market Restaurant Blend is absolutely the best! And with automatic shipment it is unsurpassed.<br />Note for those who haven't tried coffee with chicory: I've read "professional" reviews where the reviewer claims the chicory makes the coffee more bitter. I find the opposite to be true. I think these reviewers just keep repeating the same info without really testing the coffees. Besides, anyone who can drink "Charbucks" cannot complain about bitterness in any other blend. :-)

review/summary: Nice Steamed Pudding
review/text: Believe it or not, I've never tried British steamed pudding until now. I ordered Aunty's Chocolate and Spotted Dick puddings on Amazon after the recent Royal Wedding of William and Kate. I noticed on Amazon that a lot of people were buying things such as scone mixes, lemon curd, clotted cream, British tea, etc. I also noticed that some people bought steamed pudding as well. I've  always wanted to try British steamed pudding after I read Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" as a child, and saw "A Christmas Carol", the 1999 movie with Patrick Stewart and Richard E. Grant. I've seen many movie versions of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", and I honestly think that the Patrick Stewart version is the best one. The mother of an ex-boyfriend of mine told me that she saw Patrick Stewart doing the one-man Broadway show of "A Christmas Carol" when he came to St. Louis, and she told me that Patrick Stewart was excellent. Anyways, the 1999 "A Christmas Carol" movie captured the Cratchit family Christmas dinner so well. And the scene where Mrs. Cratchit brings in the Christmas pudding/plum pudding was a nice scene, and made me want to try Christmas pudding. Even though this is not titled Christmas pudding/plum pudding, it's close enough. I popped these puddings in the microwave and served them to my mother as part of her Mother's Day gift, and my whole family liked both Aunty's steamed puddings. I prefer the chocolate pudding over the spotted dick pudding. I bought some extra chocolate steamed puddings for some of my co-workers to try. I've also decided to order Walkers Shortbread Rich Fruit Pudding on Amazon to get the actual Christmas pudding experience. David Perdue has an excellent Charles Dickens website - type "charlesdickenspage.com" as part of the URL. Click on "Dickens and Christmas", scroll down and to the left there is an actual plum pudding recipe for people who desire to take the time to cook the pudding a la Cratchit family. Anyways, these Aunty's steamed puddings are easy to cook - pop them in the microwave for 30 to 40 seconds.  And they're less than 5% fat, and are suitable for vegetarians as well. If you want to try something different, then try Aunty's steamed puddings!

Lipton suggests a 4-6 minute steep, but I far preferred the lesser time -- even 3 minutes is enough. A six-minute brew was really too tart. The color is beautiful, and the tea has a good aroma in spite of the small amount of vanilla. I probably wouldn't buy it again, but naturally it's a question of taste. For me, it's good but not great.
