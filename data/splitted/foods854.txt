review/summary: great for camping and emergency kit
review/text: This is great for camping and emergency kit! I purchased the product so I can reduce the amount of gear we bring when we go camping with the kids. The kids have not noticed or commented that they are drinking powdered milk. Great for storing. I don't need to bring an extra cooler just to keep the milk cold.

review/summary: Our "milk" choice
review/text: When we decided about 25 years ago to stop using milk from cows we chose Better Than Milk as our regular replacement. We bought several quart size containers which we find the most convenient way for mixing this powdered product. We have used it every day since we made the switch. My husband and I highly recommend this product. We have found having a standing order through Amazon is a very convenient way to avoid having to shop for Better Than Milk. Try it -- hopefully you will like it too.

review/text: I thought this stuff tasted alot more sugary/carby than packaged soymilk. By reading these reviews I was informed of the low protein/high sugar content.

review/summary: Best tasting milk around
review/text: I have been using this soymilk for over ten years.  Honestly I like it better than any other soy milk - including all the new new liquid brands you can buy in your grocer's cooler that claim to taste great - I find all those have a yucky aftertaste that this one doesn't. I use the vanilla because it has more protein in it than the original.  It reminds me of malted milk, and has a full rich taste that is appealing, without any aftertaste.  It's also great in the winter mixed with hot water and some cinnamon/ginger....

review/summary: Buy the regular version!
review/text: I bought the vanilla flavor despite the negative reviews, because the regular version was out of stock. What a disaster.  The regular works beautifully as a coffee creamer, keeps forever and tastes fine.  In contrast the vanilla simply does not cream the coffee.  It never quite dissolves and ultimately sits as an unpleasant tasting sludge at the bottom of the cup.  Fortunately the regular is now back in stock - I'll be ditching my supplies of this vanilla monstrosity.  Who would have thought that a little chemical essence of vanilla could spoil a great product!

review/summary: Kids Love It
review/text: My kids love this, and we have stopped buying lactose-free cow milk in the store.<br />The vanilla flavor reminds me of cake batter. It is important to mix the water/powder ratio exactly-or make it even thicker. I made it a little too thin the first time and it had that "bean" taste most soy milk has. But when I made it thicker and made sure the water level was right, it tasted much better.<br /><br />I mix mine in small batches in recycled water bottles. I just pour it in, add the water and lid, and shake. No blender or anything fancy. My kids shake the bottle when they get it out of the fridge. No biggie.<br /><br />It's too sweet on cold cereal for me, but it's fabulous in my oatmeal, and I can imagine it would amazing in coffee or even coco.<br />I have not tried the original yet, though reviews say it's better, but I worry the original will have the "bean" taste.<br /><br />I'm very excited to have this for homemade recipes requiring powdered milk (I would use the original flavor for that), and for making dehydrated meals for emergency packs and camping. Also would be great for long-term food storage!

review/summary: Waste of money
review/text: I drink a lot of Silk Vanilla Soy milk so I was very excited about this being a reasonable back up for when I run out.  It was a major dissapointment.<br /><br />1. As other reviewers stated, it does not disolve very well unless you put it in hot water. I mixed some in hot water and then refrigerated it for a few days.  It was vile and undrinkable.<br /><br />2. The half disolved version was only passable.  Nothing I would drink again.<br /><br />3.  It tastes sugary like a cheap powdered coffee creamer when added to coffee or tea but it is drinkable. Its only marginally better tasting in hot drinks than powdered milk only because its mostly sugar.  I will continue to use it as expensive coffee creamer until it is gone rather than waste it entirely.<br /><br />I will not buy this again. I would not recomend it to anyone.

review/summary: Watch Out for Expiration Date!!
review/text: I recently purchased this item since these are the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I usually eat one for lunch every couple of weeks. Unfortunately, these noodle bowls arrived with an expiration date of January 2009. So now I have to eat 24 noodle bowls in the next 4 months, which averages out to 6 a month. Don't get me wrong, these are great noodles. I just don't want to have to eat them so quickly. If I had known that these were going to expire in 4 months, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time...

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: If you're an instant-ramen connoisseur, this is the noodle you've been searching for. Bowl Noodle is far better than any other instant noodle I've had. The broth is cloudy, rich, and immensely flavorful compared to any soup, not just other instants, but surprisingly light on the tongue and stomach... much unlike the, heavy, bland dollar-a-dozen cardboard noodle. (To emphasize the difference: Top Ramen and Ichiban actually make me throw up now, just because they're too bland and... cardboard... -esque... I can stomach Maruchan if I fill it with my entire spice cabinet.) Bowl Noodle has the same punch as Campbell Hearty when it comes to taste. Two of them fill me perfectly if I'm in desperate hunger. I'll have one for a snack instead of chips because it's a lot quicker and more satisfying. I recommend these to all my ramen-eating friends and they love them to death, but they're around 5-10x more expensive than Maruchan. Every penny is worth it, though. To those who buy: you're in for a treat. Enjoy!

review/summary: Good Flavor and Just Spicy Enough - Recommended
review/text: These Nong Shim "Bowl Noodle, Hot and Spicy" bowls are very good tasting and a little over the medium range of the spicy hot range. The spiciness is about right right for me, but no one else in my house can handle these.<br /><br />While they can not be directly microwaved, these are easy enough to prepare by following the directions. All you have to do is pull the cover halfway up, open and add the contents of the flavor packet, add hot water, and let it sit for three minutes.<br /><br />My only concern about these is that the nutritional information lists the serving size is listed as 1/2 the bowl (didn't notice that before we ordered them), which means you have to double the values if you eat the whole thing. A whole bowl then contains 380 Calories, 50 Carbs (too much for me), and 78% of your total daily recommended Sodium. I get around this by braking and removing half of the dry noodle bunch before adding the hot water.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

The bins(even if they are not bunny shaped) are recycle friendly you can give one or two of them to your kids to put their crayons or ''Treasures'' in, and you can blue bin them which is another plus.

review/summary: Tastes better with less sugar and fewer calories
review/text: I decided to buy the "no sugar added" version of this product because I just noticed that my local grocery store offered it. I expected this version of the product to not taste very good or to have a weird aftertaste. On the contrary, chocolate milk made with "no sugar added" Nesquik tastes better than the regular version. It has more chocolate flavor than the regular product and my daughter says that this version is "more powerful". This is likely why my daughter uses less of the product in her milk. (We make chocolate milk about 2x month, which makes it just an occasional drink for us, so she always used more than the "recommended serving" in her glass of milk. Haven't we all?)<br /><br />Perhaps the product has been reformulated since the previous reviews were made that mentioned the chalkiness of the product or the extra effort to dissolve it, but I have not encountered either. If anyone remembers the PDQ product from the 1970s, the Nesquik "no sugar added" version has a similar appearance because the product forms balls and chips instead of the perfectly sandy/dusty appearance of regular Nesquik. Nevertheless, I found the "no sugar added" version dissolved just as easily as regular version and it doesn't seem chalky at all. Given that this version costs less, has less sugar and fewer calories and is "more powerful", I will not buy the regular version again. Why would I? I hope no one at Nestle just read that.

review/summary: It is toooo sweet!
review/text: The reason I purchased this product is for the "No Sugar Added" clause. I am annoyed with all the sugar that is added in almost everything. Every kids cocoa drink has too much sugar added. After I tasted my first drink, it felt  too sweet and had an after taste. The taste of an artificial sweetener. After checking the ingredients, I noticed it contains "Sucralose". According to Wikipedia, Sucralose is 600 sweeter than table sugar! What's the point of buying something that has no sugar added but adding something that's tons of times sweeter? I am not going after the calorie factor. So does Nesquick add 600 times less amount of Sucralose than sugar to get the same sweetness? I don't think so.<br /><br />Another major problem is that Amazon's ingredients section does NOT mention Sucralose. It mentions Aspartame which, according to Wikipedia, it's 100-150 times sweeter than sugar, which means much less sweeter than Sucralose. So did Nesquick change their ingredients and Amazon did not update their ingredients list?

review/summary: Many uses for this healthy body tonic
review/text: A good friend sent me an email a year ago regarding the health benefits of Green Giant Asparagus Spears (health-full all by itself, and contains no pesticides or preservatives).  Having a number of health challenges, including fibromyalgia, I decided to give the asparagus regimen a try -- and am I ever glad I did!  It has helped in so many ways, and if I happen to forget and miss a day, I can tell right away the next day in the amount and location of increased pain.  I put the whole can in a blender, plus a tablespoon of minced garlic for added flavor, and puree.  With four tablespoons taken twice daily, the benefits are noticeable within a few days. When you sign up for the subscription service with Amazon, this product is delivered to your door for free, and at the best price I've been able to find anywhere.<br />I highly recommend this regimen as a dietary supplement. As I am not a doctor, I have included an excerpt from someone who is:  As a biochemist, I have made an extensive study of all aspects of cancer, and all of the proposed cures. As a result, I am convinced that asparagus fits in better with the latest theories about cancer.  Asparagus contains a good supply of protein called histones, which are believed to be active in controlling cell growth. For that reason, I believe asparagus can be said to contain a substance that I call cell growth normalizer. That accounts for its action on cancer and in acting as a general body tonic. In any event, regardless of theory, asparagus used as we suggest, is a harmless substance.<br /><br />The FDA cannot prevent you from using it and it may do you much good...  It has been reported by the US National Cancer Institute, that asparagus is the highest tested food containing glutathione, which is considered one of the body's most potent anticarcinogens and antioxidants.

review/summary: If you need a review...
review/text: ...Then you've never been on a diet in the winter time.  If the only asparagus out there was the fresh kind, I'd just go into withdrawal.  Granted, the canned spears taste absolutely NOTHING like the fresh, but that's okay.  They still have virtually no calories; they're a natural diuretic; they taste good -- and faintly asparagus-like.  The texture is completely different -- but again, just think of it as a separate kind of vegg.<br /><br />good cold out of the can with a little balsamic vinegar; and actually, good in soup when you cut them up.  Some relative of mine used Green Giant asparagus for a baked dish that was a lot like potatoes au gratin -- but with GG asparagus instead of potatoes.  Kind of a green, gooey, messy thing, but the flavor was nice.  I suspect that if you sub'd 2% sharp cheddar cheese, 1% milk, and used a bit of Egg Beaters instead of real eggs, it would be a decent low-cal quicky meal.<br /><br />A good, utilitarian food.  Fresh is always better -- but with our 110-in-the-shade summers -- fresh is about 1 week in May.

Our weather is so hot, we can grow asparagus, but only for a short time in the Winter and in very specially prepared soil, etc. Worth it, tho, and comes back every year, but still most of the year we cannot even BUY fresh asparagus. Asparagus is so GOOD for your health, why not have it delivered all year? By the way, eat the WHOLE CAN! It has a total of 70 calories!!

review/text: And although these do not taste as great as the fresh, they DO taste good -- and perhaps because they have been in liquid, in the can, they are softer and more of the stalk is edible (as contrasted with fresh-cooked, where the stalk usually gets tough once you get to the middle.)<br /><br />My simple tastes require nothing more than mayo and lemon on these tasty bundles. I pour the liquid into a glass and add some lemon there too-- yum.

I really loved the flavor, and brought the empty bottle back with me to try and find it here in the US.  Unfortunately, I have only been able to find it in these plastic bottles, which concern me.  Lipton Ice Tea in glass bottles tastes nothing like the same tea in their plastic bottles.  Their plastic bottles impart a weird flavor, and I will never buy it again that way.  There have been so many health problems associated with plastic bottles.  It's a shame that a health drink should be so difficult to find in a simple glass bottle - as in Europe.

review/text: This is a nice coarse blend of garlic and parsley. A couple of things to note:<br /><br />1. There are remnants of the garlic husk in the seasoning - a bit unacceptable - should be the pure garlic bulb<br />2. The product is packaged in the US but from garlic imported from China. Since we have Gilroy, CA - I have no idea why we need to get our garlic from China - other than cheaper cost - but quality suffers and I like to support our farmers here in the US - so will I'll be looking for US made in the future.<br /><br />The blend is course - so be aware - it is not a fine powder type blend. I like it as it adds a bit of texture to steak and roasts - but you may want a bit more fine of a grind.

review/summary: The Best...Strong Flavor
review/text: I have been buying this brand of garlic powder from a local warehouse store here for years now.  It costs a little more but well makes up for it in flavor.  They call it a California style with parsley, which I can hardly taste..  What really sets it apart from the rest is the garlic itself is a course blend that is richer in color and stronger in flavor than any other kind of garlic powder I have ever tried.  (And believe me, I have ventured far into trying many of them).  Even though it costs a little more it can actually save you money by using a little less since its so strong. ( Or if you happen to be a garlic fiend like myself, just pour it on and enjoy!).  If you can't find this anywhere locally, I highly recommend it here on Amazon.  I have never come across a stronger more flavorful blend yet... : )

review/text: I really like when my mother in-law grilled some salmon, by using the salmon rub.  I was the best tasting salmon I have ever had!!  So when I saw that there were other rubs I had to try them out.  I still think the salmon rub is the best one out of the bunch, but the others are tasty too.  The spices to me are a little on the spicy side (which I don't care for) with undertone of something smoked, but just enough to add flavor and not overpower the meat.  I think if I were to buy again, I would only buy the salmon rub, but these are still worth a try.

review/text: I am a big fan of Tom Douglas (visting many of his Seattle restaurants & own a couple of his cookbooks). Generally, I give this out as a gift to friends and family that are looking for something that is unique Seattle gift. I always get a good response on the gift. For my own cooking, I really enjoy the flavors that these rubs add.

review/summary: Highly Recommended
review/text: We have a Type I diabetic grandson - age 4 - and we are always looking for protein products to regulate his glucose highs and lows - especially the lows.  This is a wonderful product - 8oz. bottle has 16 total carbs and 16g of protein per 8 oz. bottle.  Protein items that kids like are hard to come by.  We call this "chocolate milk". The very chocolate flavor must be good tasting because he drinks it all up.  Sometimes I'll mix the bottle with 8ozs. of skim milk to extend the length.  Given at bedtime especially and first thing in the morning, I know he has good protein to help regulate his blood sugar.  So far it has worked great. Try it!

If im in dire need, i'll go to my nearest gas station and pick up a single pack for about two bucks, but I usually make sure i put it on my list for the grocery store.  There i'll get the 3 pack and pay a little over three bucks for the pack.<br /><br />With this, you get 24 packs of gum for 17 bucks, you cant beat it!!!!<br /><br />No problem with shipping, got my free two day with amazon prime!<br /><br />I will buy all of my gum from here until they stop selling it!!! lol

review/summary: OK GINGER
review/text: I like that the only ingredients of this item are ginger and sugar, but I felt that the taste of sugar was overpowering the taste of ginger, even after I took some sugar off the ginger. Otherwise, the ginger is soft and tasty, and the packaging allows taking little boxes with you for convenient snacking.<br />I like the Trader Joe's ginger better though, and I absolutely love crystallized ginger from Nutsonline whose sponsored link appears right after the Product Details under the title "Customers Viewing This Page May be Interested in These Sponsored Links". Their price for the crystallized ginger is also better. The only problem is the shipping charge, which is pretty expensive, but you might find other great products on their site and buy in bulk, thus reducing the shipping cost per pound. Clicking on their link will also generate revenue for Amazon, so go ahead and investigate for yourself.<br />I also tried Ty Ling Crystallized Ginger and thought it was really good, so I subscribed to have it delivered to me monthly.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FDCVOU">Ty Ling Crystallized Ginger Slices, 4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Best Tasting Ginger
review/text: Ok I don't know a whole lot about ginger but I do know I have tried other brands that were soapy tasting, tough, stringy, not very flavorful.  Then I tried this brand because it was cheap.  Oh my gosh!  I seriously want to put this big box on my christmas list!  I tend to have alot of nausea sometimes and this is the best tasting ginger I've ever tasted.  The slices are paper thin but really pack a punch.  I just ate my last piece and my mouth is feeling the heat but it's a good heat.  Oh so spicy, sweet and just delicious!  I wish I had some more right now.  I also wish they sold it in smaller packs than 24.  It's alot to pay for at once.  One time I ate some when alka-seltzer and pepto bismol weren't helping my nausea, and this helped get rid of it instantly!

review/text: Ginger has many health benefits, and Roland crystallized ginger is a very tasty way to take the ginger.  The sugar gives just enough sweetness to take some of the strong taste of the natural ginger out.  The pieces of ginger are very tender, and as I say a joy to eat.  I enjoy it on a daily basis.  Also, the ginger was very fresh tasting; an overall good product that I recommend highly.

review/summary: LOVE this ginger !!
review/text: I received this quickly and it was packed securely. I love the little individually packaged 3 oz. boxes. They would be great for little gifts for friends or stocking stuffers, that is....IF I could bear to part with any of it. Also perfect for carrying in a handbag or briefcase. Previously I was purchasing my ginger in the bulk department of Whole Foods [quite a distance from where I live]  This ginger is better tasting and a much better price!!  The pieces are just soft enough, but not overly soft....about 1/8 inch thick or slightly thinner. And the sugar used appears to be the larger crystals I know as 'icing sugar'. The strength of the ginger is just right for me, not enough to be fiery or leave you breathless, but certainly enough to know you've eaten ginger!  It is a tiny bit messy to eat, with the crystal sugar dropping a little on your shirt, but worth it, I assure you!  YUM.....just right for an after dinner treat!!  I don't ordinarily use ginger in baking, but I can see where this would work well chopped and diced in baked goods, or dipped in chocolate.<br />  I did a lot of research here on Amazon to find a good priced product, and I was pleased and surprised to not only find a great price for about 4.5 pounds of ginger.  That is 24 small, cello-wrapped [really rather cute] 3 oz. boxes of crystallized ginger. They come packaged in two boxes [shrink wrapped] with 12 little boxes inside each one.<br />  I was also pleased with the fact that the only ingredients listed are ginger and sugar, no sulfites. That is always good, as I am sensitive. It says on the box PRODUCT OF CHINA.<br />  I can't recommend this high enough....10 Stars easily!!

review/summary: At 38%, definitely big league
review/text: Since I use these as coffee flavorings, I'll review it on that criteria. First, it arrived well-packaged from Trade Concepts; in fact, the packer even signed it.<br /><br />In the ten-pack, you get three types: kirsh wasser, or cherry brandy; eierlikor, made from eggs; and Williamsbrand (couldn't find any info about that). The brandy gives coffee the same heat I got from Anthon Bergs, only much stronger---so I get three uses from each bottle, which is about two or three times the content of Anthon Berg bottles. The chocolate gets a little slippery at room temp, but that's a minor problem.<br /><br />To sum up: it's a fine and cheaper alternative to the much pricier brands in the small bottles. But it definitely packs a punch.

review/summary: Marzipan Tastes Bland and Contains Sorbitol
review/text: Normally I buy almond paste, not prepared marzipan, but thought that just this once I could save a little time. There is no one to blame but myself for not reading the ingedient list before buying. This is what happens when you rush. By now I should know that when it comes to even old stand-by products, nothing can be taken for granted.<br /><br />The ingredient list begins as expected, sugar, blanched almonds, water but then it veers off into new frontier - sorbitol -- then corn syrup and potassium sorbate finish the list. Potassium sorbate is used as a preservative to extend shelf-life, and perhaps is necessary, but why is sorbitol added to something as straightforward as marzipan? If this wasn't enough, the marzipan does not have a good almond flavor -- it is incredibly bland.<br /><br />Ironically, and a bit off the subject, I just read a book about dental health that discussed how damaging sorbitol is to the teeth and gums even though it is a popular sweetener in sugar-free gums and mints. The dentist who wrote the book stated that the bad bacteria in the mouth actually adapt to sorbitol quickly and begins to feed on it with greater frenzy than pure sugar.<br /><br />Whether the dental issue is of concern, sorbitol is widely known to cause intestinal distress in some people, and people with irritable bowel syndrome limit or completely avoid the product. Bottom line is that sorbitol isn't usually found in marzipan and unless this ingredient is specifically desired by the purchaser, I'd steer clear for that reason alone.<br /><br />I cook and bake in order to avoid additives, so this marzipan is particularly unacceptable for my use. Tallying up the plusses and minuses we have on the plus side, it is the correct texture for shaping and rolling out. On the minus side -- it is incredibly bland and is chemically enhanced with an artificial sweetener. Never again.

review/summary: Something is Very Wrong
review/text: Something is Very Wrong  The product is excellent. I have been buying it for several years, first at Whole Foods, and then when they dropped the product, I have been purchasing it online.  In fact I was purchasing this product in its original size, 11 oz.  When the size decreased the retail price remained the same and I was O.K. with that.<br /><br />However, the price has been going up CONSIDERABLY. I purchase 36 jars per order to save on shipping. With each order there is ALWAYS another price increase.<br /><br />My recent order of September 2012 for 36 jars was apparently packed at the warehouse and sent to the store. The store did not repack it  (I did not purchase it at Amazon).  Each box of six was sealed with warehouse tape identifying the item. It stated the name of the store it was shipped to as well as the flavor. The following information shocked me, and I quote:<br /><br />RIGONI FRUIT SPRD 8.82 OZ Pack 6 Retail 5.99<br /><br />Did you note the price? Retail 5.99!!!! It did not state wholesale, it said RETAIL PRICE. No one sells it for 5.99, yet the warehouse stipulates that is the retail price. Am I missing something here? I guess it is a matter of what the market will bear.....OUTRAGEOUS!  Plus of course additional  shipping Chg.  How many hundreds of dollars have I wasted?! On principal alone I will give up on this product. The GREED is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />I gave this product one star, even though it is excellent, because it is incredibly overpriced and of the many hundreds of dollars I had wasted with the purchase of this product.  I feel like an utter fool, thats because I was one.

review/summary: An acquired taste...
review/text: Let me start by saying these are not for everybody.  In fact, my personal experience is that most non-Indian people don't like them at all.  I fall into a different category because I love Indian pickles (AKA achar).  Indian food is about variety and these pickles certainly hold up their end of the bargain.<br /><br />If you've never tried achar, don't buy these until you try a single bottle first.  I would describe the taste as astringent, hot and salty -- in that order.  If I haven't scared you off yet then go for it.  You might actually acquire a taste for them too.  Keep in mind that a little goes a loooong way.  A typical serving is a tablespoon or two maximum.<br /><br />BTW: It took me six months of eating Indian food daily before I started to like achar -- but that's another story.

review/text: Great Horny Toads! This is great stuff! I tried it on a whim while suffering dreadful sinusitis and nasal polyps. OK, it didn't cure anything, but it sure made me feel better, got the sinus passages to open up, and enabled me to sleep. I ended up needing sinus surgery (The whole caboodle: every sinus) and I used this every day up to the day of surgery to keep the drainage going while I was on prednisone.<br /><br />Best advice is to bring a bottle of water with you into the bathroom while you soak, and don't make the mix too strong. Keep it to two ounces per full tub.  And do sit for 20 minutes, even if you have to keep topping off the tub with more water. It will loosen up phlegm and get that blood circulating.<br /><br />Then, you MUST get into bed and stay warm. Don't get chilled afterward.<br /><br />I was able to do the brief cold shower ritual only once. The mustard bath makes me too sleepy and a little light headed. So normally I wrap up in a huge towel and exit the bathroom to dry off and change. Then under the blankets for at least an hour.<br /><br />Wonderful stuff!

review/summary: Dr.Singha's Mustard bath is a must for sore muscles!
review/text: I've used this product for years to remove lactic acids that build up after deep tissue massage therapy, or after a vigorous work-out. It's relaxing and if you want to, you can put in a drop or two lavender oil for the ultimate aromatherapy relaxation treatment. Bought one for me and one as a Christmas gift. This is one "must have product for me! I don't recommend products unless I see results, and this delivers! Great Value & find on Amazon!

review/summary: Who needs Epsom
review/text: I have used multiple bath soaks. I am a swimmer so my muscles get extremely sore. I have tried Epsom salt over the years but ran into this product at a local grocery store. I fell in love with it. I was scared the tub would only come with directions on how much to put in, but low and behold it has a scooper so you know. It dissolves easily into the tub and is easy to wash off. I highly recommend this product as an athlete and for anyone with arthritis and/or sore muscles from small injuries, standing all day, or just needing a soothing bath.

review/summary: Mustard Bath will make you sleepy
review/text: Normally I assume that any bath product, other than epsom salt, which claims to be soothing and relaxing is just going to smell good and not be useful. The mustard bath exceeded my expecations. I tried it the day after a night of drinking, and after 15 minutes I had the urge to get out of the tub immediately and lie down. Took a 2 hour nap, and felt totally refreshed afterward. Definitely good for detox!

review/summary: RELAXING AND HEALING
review/text: I am a fan of this mustard bath, especially when I feel a cold coming on or need to relax muscles that are sore. It helps me sweat while in the bathtub and usually the next day my cold is gone.  I love the smell of the mustard and wintergreen but don't like that I need to scrub the tub right after as it makes an orange color ring around the tub.  It is easy to remove so don't worry.

review/summary: Tasty, complex flavor.
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that this Teriyaki rice is not a boring "industrial food" flavor. It is rich and complex, and has some nice touches, like some little bits of leeks. The ingredient list includes some really tasty stuff, like: ginger, sesame oil, tamarind, and Worchestershire sauce. The only critique I have is the sodium content, which is sadly the case with most sides like this. When will they learn to put less salt in these things??? This one isn't the worst I have seen, the labels states 730mg sodium per 1 cup prepared serving, which is 30% of the RDV. As far as shipping, the pouches come packaged in the manufacturers unit packaging box, the envelopes are not loose in the Amazon box, so there is no problem with damage or tearing.
