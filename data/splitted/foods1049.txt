review/summary: Subtle But High Quality Coffee
review/text: I can't count the times I've bought a flavored coffee, opened the bag and inhaled the incredible aroma only to be disappointed that, once brewed the special "flavor" either isn't detectable or conversely completely overpowers the coffee itself .  Few coffee companies achieve that "happy medium" of providing specialty flavor without compromising the integrity of the coffee itself.<br /><br />Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla is the exception.  This mostly medium roast has an unmistakable but not obnoxious vanilla perfume upon opening.  I was pleased to find that upon tasting, there is indeed a distinct vanilla note to the coffee, but one that is content to stay in the background and compliment rather than dominate.  It is not overly sweet and wears on the palate well over the course of a few cups.<br /><br />I you are the type who doctors your coffee up with flavored sugars and/or creamers the subtleties of this coffee may not matter to you.  But for those who are interested in actually tasting the coffee, this is a good buy.

review/summary: Here's what many aren't understanding about this coffee
review/text: They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as "Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like "rich" and "smooth and creamy", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good.

review/summary: Great Coffee with One Caveat ...
review/text: If you enjoy Starbucks coffee, than you already know that this is well worth the money. So buy it! If you are (somehow!) new to the franchise or this specific product, read on ...<br /><br />Now, I'm almost inclined to rate this product as though it didn't read "vanilla." To be perfectly frank, the vanilla taste is nearly undetectable (and I have a fairly sensitive nose and palette). I see that multiple reviewers here have registered similar "complaints." Surely, I think Starbucks would have been wise to label the product as having "a hint of vanilla." So, please know that this is not a true vanilla flavor (just in case you are searching for a brew to compliment a particular dessert or breakfast.)<br /><br />Nonetheless, as far as the standards of coffee, this one has near perfect acidity, a lovely aroma, and bright flavor.<br /><br />If you need a little more sweetness, add raw sugar (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5ZGU">Sugar In The Raw/Unrefined</a> is a great choice and can be found just about anywhere).<br /><br />Bottom-line: do not buy this coffee expecting a rich vanilla flavor and you'll be fine. Very tasty!<br /><br />Post-script: I saw that a chef noted that Starbucks was not created to drink black. While I never use milk in my coffee, I decided to take this professional's advice. I added some (soy) milk and found that the very slight "bitterness" was entirely gone. (Now I have reinstated the product's missing star!)

review/summary: Starbucks is consistant...
review/text: ... consistently bad.<br /><br />--- EDITED 11-27-2010 ---<br />Has anyone read the ingredients? This product contains corn maltodextrin (which I have an allergy to), vegetable glycerin, and Indian sarsaparilla root. This is probably where the odd and nasty taste I am getting is coming from.<br /><br />And why the hell are these in coffee? Shouldn't it be JUST coffee and whatever flavoring is added?<br /><br />Way to go Starbucks! 1 star!<br />--- EDIT ---<br /><br />I've tried many different Starbucks coffees, from morning blends to more flavored coffees and not one have I enjoyed or liked.<br /><br />The vanilla flavor in Starbucks Natural Fusions is a joke. When you first open the bag you are hit with this amazing aroma of nice fragrant coffee with a delightful hint of vanilla. When brewing, you completely loose the vanilla smell. And once tasted, the vanilla is GONE. And I don't think I should be expected to have to add something (be it milk, cream, or some other product) to bring out the flavor of the coffee. A good coffee can stand alone straight from the pot.<br /><br />No matter how weak or strong I made it, it had a not so pleasant taste to it. I'm thinking that it had a lot of quakers in it before the coffee was ground, thus this odd taste was present.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the look and design of the bag, initial smell, and the fact that it gives me my caffeine for the day, even if I have to chug it.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board Starbucks and come back with a better tasting blend.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Smells great!<br />Didn't get a bitter taste from it (oddly enough).<br /><br />Cons:<br />Didn't taste like vanilla by any stretch.<br />Isn't all that palatable to my or three other peoples taste.<br />Pricey for mediocre coffee.

review/summary: If Flavor is Your Choice, Nothing Wrong Here
review/text: Firstly, I do drink a fair amount of coffee during the winter months.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I tend not to drink flavored coffee.  This is ground, flavored coffee.  Starbucks has not previously offered flavored coffees themselves because they know it will contaminate unflavored coffee in a grinder.  They are getting around this by only selling the coffee pre-ground, therefore, no customer will ever request it to be ground.<br /><br />When first opened, the quality is decent despite being pre-ground.  However, I do find, the quality of the product slips away fairly quickly being a ground coffee.<br /><br />Furthermore, again, I am not a particular fan of flavored coffees.  If I need a sweetener or flavor, I'd prefer to add it myself.  Nevertheless, this  vanilla flavored product is not terribly unpleasant.  I was able to enjoy it on a quiet morning or two when I wasn't demanding the very best.<br /><br />If flavored coffees is your thing, you will likely have no problems at all!

review/summary: Good coffee with pretty natural vanilla flavor
review/text: Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of flavored coffees. I generally find them frivolous when I'm feeling generous and a sign of moral weakness when I'm not. In fact, I chose this coffee from Amazon vine by accident, and only finally tried it months later, when I ran out of regular coffee and was desperate. I stored it in the freezer in the meantime, so it would be as fresh as possible and I'd be giving it a fair shake, since ground coffee can lose flavor so quickly.<br /><br />I tried to temper my review to judge this product as someone who doesn't have a moral objection to flavored coffee (no one with my preference would buy it in real life, so it's unfair to judge it by the standards of someone who dislikes flavored coffee), and just rated the overall quality of the coffee and the strength and quality of the vanilla flavor.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, whether iced or hot.<br /><br />The verdict: I'm still no fan of flavored coffee. But this coffee is good enough, and the vanilla flavor is strong but not cloying. I would definitely tolerate it for the sake of pleasing a guest who liked flavored coffees--which is more than I've ever been able to say for a flavored coffee before (typically, flavoring seems to be a compensation for crappy coffee, not an addition to good coffee). Hot, I found it tolerable (=very good, if I actually wanted vanilla in my coffee). And iced, it was actually verging on pleasant. It has a very faint acrid afternote, almost like chickory coffee, which I think would be dispelled or improved with milk, which most flavored coffee drinkers I know favor anyway.<br /><br />While I still wouldn't drink it on purpose if there was any regular coffee in the house, I didn't find it to be the abomination I expected, and I feel confident that it would be well received by flavored coffee lovers, so I give it 4 stars for quality and strength, and its expected success with people who like this stuff.

review/text: I am no effete coffee genius who can go into the infinite spectrum of points about what makes a coffee good or not so good, but I do appreciate an astounding, wake-me-up twist on an old theme. This isn't it.<br /><br />While achieving everything an adequate coffee should provide, Starbuck's Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee is just that - adequate coffee. I was not blown away by subtle essences of vanilla; it did smell pretty good while brewing, which I suppose is the aim of coffee in general (one of the Top Ten Smells in the world, IMO, is a good coffee brewing up), but the flavor wasn't any more spectacular than any other coffee on the market. I would categorize it as robust, full-bodied, and - good. Not wow, do-cartwheels, jump-up-and-down...just that - good. Maybe the vanilla essence needs to be a little more noticeable, but for flavored coffee, I prefer Gloria Jean's.

review/text: I don't normally drink coffee on a day to day basis as I like the vanilla flavorings and since I'm cutting down on all things sugar that is usually a no-no. That said, I was thrilled to get a chance to try this via Vine and we brewed a pot at the office this morning. Except for the boss and controller who loathe fru-fru coffee of any kind, everyone else loved it. The smell from the opened package was very pleasant (always my favorite part of the coffee experience). I felt it was a bit bitter black, but after adding some flavored creamer (yes, I did have some), I ended up with a very yummy cuppa joe.<br /><br />This might not be the roast for everyone (and I see from another review there are some rather, ummm, interesting ingredients there) but this was a definite thumbs up from this office gang.

It's simply a matter of taste and choice.<br /><br />Also, if you bring in your empty bag to Starbucks, they will give you a free coffee.  Isn't that nice?

review/text: Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusions Ground Coffee has just a touch of natural vanilla infused into the coffee.

Perhaps it's just me, as I've never been able to discern much of the "flavor" in the vast majority of flavored coffees offered in coffee shops or for home brewing.<br /><br />That having been said, this Starbucks variety has a very distinct roasted aroma and makes a powerful cup of coffee.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting
review/text: Having lived my entire life in the great state of Louisiana, I've always been partial to local coffee brands such as Community Coffee and Mello Joy.  I try to make a point of buying these local brands for the simple fact that the money stays in Louisiana and both of them taste very good.  To me, Starbucks has always been an overpriced and overhyped brand with a brilliant marketing strategy that put them on the map.  Still, I sometimes visit the local Starbucks for a frappucino or even an Earl Grey latte when I have a bit of extra spending money on hand.<br /><br />I picked up Starbucks' Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, via the Vine program.  I have to admit that it's a very good coffee as far as flavored coffees go.  The scent of the vanilla intertwined with the coffee hits you before you even open the bag, but do not use that as a device of judgement until after you've brewed a few cups of this coffee.<br /><br />As I've already said, the smell of vanilla is strong, but the actual vanilla flavor is very slight.  In fact, the vanilla is very hard to taste at all.<br /><br />I decided to brew this coffee in two separate ways:  1) Per the instructions on the bag (two tablespoons per six ounces of water) and 2) By my normal method (three tablespoons per six ounces of water).<br /><br />After brewing the coffee, I drank each brewed cup in three different ways:  1) black (which is my normal method of drinking coffee), 2) with one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, and 3) with two teaspoons of cream and two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />What I immediately noticed was that the bag's brewing instructions suited my personal taste best.  My normal brewing method made the coffee stronger (as I like it), but didn't alter the taste at all.<br /><br />When I drank the coffee black in both brewing cases, I noticed almost no difference in the taste, although the coffee's body was a bit heavier in the second brewing method.  The vanilla flavor was miniscule.<br /><br />With one teaspoon of cream and one teaspoon of sugar, I found that the vanilla flavor stood out a bit more, but was still fairly weak.  The overall taste of the coffee was good, though.<br /><br />With two teaspoons of cream and sugar, the vanilla came into its own a bit more, but could not overtake the coffee's taste itself.<br /><br />Overall, this is a coffee drinker's flavored coffee.  If you want a fuller, sweeter vanilla taste and less coffee taste, look elsewhere.  If you only drink flavored coffees as a treat but prefer the taste of medium to dark roast coffee alone, this brew will be right up your alley.<br /><br />I personally enjoyed this coffee, and plan to buy more of it soon.

review/summary: Very Vanilla
review/text: For as long as Starbucks has been around and for as long as they have been selling packages of their coffee, it is somewhat suprising that they have not had a vanilla flavored product of this quality before now.  The Natural Fusions vanilla flavored coffee offers coffee drinkers the real thing.  The taste is not artificial and does not seem like an afterthought or an add-in to the coffee itself.  The scent of vanilla is not overpowering and the coffee has an extremely smooth taste to it.  Plus, it is much nicer to brew high quality Starbucks coffee at home and not have to pay the ridiculously high in-store prices for it.  This new Natural Fusions line is a fitting addition to the Starbucks family.

This smooth, balanced, medium-roast blend also has a real vanilla aroma and an interesting touch of sasparilla. It's reasonably priced, so I'm likely to buy more of it."

I tried it for several days and still found the bitterness every time. I tried it with less sugar and more sugar and cream and no cream but it was still a little bitter for me no matter what.<br /><br />Starbucks has many good flavored coffees for the holidays, and in general, and I drink them often. This coffee to me, didn't live up to the wonderful flavors I have drank that carry the Starbuck's name. I think the coffee needs a little more of the vanilla flavor unless Fusion means that it's just a hint, and it's a very small hint at that.<br /><br />The coffee itself smells very good and it also smells wonderful when it's brewing, but it lacks a little something that would make it really good. It needs a little more vanilla and less of a bitter taste to live up to the vanilla in the name.

review/summary: Smell is luscious,I think I would make it just for the smell alone
review/text: If you love flavored coffees you will love this.  They do a nice job of delivering a noticeable vanilla flavor.  If you find the artificial aftertaste that most flavor coffees have unpleasant then you will probably not like this.  The smell is luscious and I think I would make it just for the smell alone.

review/summary: Very good flavor.
review/text: As an addicted coffee drinker, I love trying out new flavors.  I have, of course, drank Starbucks coffee before, as well as Vanilla flavored coffees.  However, I have not had the two combined together into one coffee.  I can honestly say that I was not disappointed with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The package is incredibly well sealed and upon opening, the scent is mouth-watering and fresh.<br /><br />The amount used is the same as with any other coffee - 2 TBS per 6 oz of water.  This, of course, can be adjusted for each individual's preference.  The scent is heavenly, as the coffee is brewing and the taste is very robust and holds a light flavor of vanilla.  The vanilla flavoring is a very gentle and light taste, almost a whisper soft hint.  In addition, the taste is not bitter, but smooth and delicious.  I am one who drinks with a bit of sugar and cream, rather than straight black, as well as being rather picky on my coffee, as it bothers my stomach if it is overly acidic.  I had not problems, at all, with this particular coffee.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a full-bodied coffee with a slight hint of a vanilla taste.  This makes for a delicious drink any time of the day.

review/summary: OK for a flavored ground coffee
review/text: I was a bit hesitant to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> because I typically do not like flavored coffees and prefer whole bean coffee which I can grind myself. But for a flavored ground coffee, I suppose this one is OK.<br /><br />The flavor is not bad but the aroma is intoxicating. (I think I prefer the way the coffee smells rather than how it tastes.)  The lightly roasted Latin American arabica coffee beans are flavored with ground vanilla beans, Indian sarsaparilla root, and the ambiguous "natural flavor" (which also includes corn maltodextrin and vegetable glycerin). The vanilla is highlighted but not overdone.<br /><br />I usually drink my coffee black and without sweetening and for my taste <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>  can stand alone without additional enhancement.<br /><br />The brewing recommendations suggest 2 Tbsp coffee for every 6 fl oz water.  I find that a bit too much and get a smoother, less biting flavor with 1 1/2 Tbsp coffee per 6 fl oz water, but that of course is to my taste.<br /><br />I do wish the coffee could be fair trade and organically grown but Starbucks states on the package that the coffee is "100% Responsibly grown.  Ethically traded."  At least that is something in the right direction.<br /><br />Finally, I noticed a special offer on my package ~ take the empty bag of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a> to a participating Starbucks and receive a free "tall" brewed coffee. That's nice, eh?

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My boyfriend and I both realized within the last year or so that we enjoyed Starbucks brand coffee best in our house, so it's one of our splurges. Since I work from home, I don't hit the coffee shops, I need to get my fix from the kitchen. He's also started bringing a travel mug to work instead of stopping off at a shop, so we find it's necessary to buy coffee we REALLY like. I was thrilled to try this and it didn't disappointed.<br /><br />I expected something like the usual vanilla flavored coffee. But this was more subtle and natural tasting. It was a startling surprise from what I'm used to when buying flavored coffees. There was nothing fake or overly sweet about it. Boyfriend also said he liked it a lot, which I didn't expect since he's not really a flavored coffee kinda person. Delicious coffee, and I look forward to trying the other fusion flavors.

review/text: First off, a funny thing, when I was making the first pot of coffee, my husband thought maybe it had gone bad and had worms in it or something. There are white slivers/specks in the coffee grounds, which I assumed were something from vanilla beans. I hope it was, otherwise I may have made worm larva coffee! So, onto my review!<br /><br />I enjoyed this coffee much more than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee</a> I recently tried. Personally, I am a gold card carrying fan of Starbucks, so it shouldn't come as a suprise that I enjoyed this coffee. As a general rule, I would say if you enjoy Starbucks and you enjoy vanilla, you should enjoy this coffee. If you are not a fan of Starbucks, don't look for this coffee to be the magic sip that changes your mind.

review/text: Right when you open this bag of coffee the amazing vanilla bean smell hits you and you think, "Man, this is gonna be a great cup of coffe!"<br />It smells like very fine whole vanilla beans that you've just split open. Unfortunately, that wonderful smell doesn't transfer to the actual cup of brewed coffee. (For full disclosure, I use a Cuisineart Auto drip) Once in your cup, the vanilla bean taste is way muted and kind of acidic.<br />On the plus side, this coffee comes ground fine, which I like. I wouldn't buy this again.

review/summary: The vanilla's a little TOO vanilla for me.
review/text: Yes, I know. It says "vanilla" and you expect it to taste like vanilla. What am I complaining about? Well, I was sort of expecting it to taste a bit more like coffee with a hint of vanilla, but instead this tastes like a blend of vanilla and coffee, in that order. Some people say they barely taste the vanilla. For me, it was front-and-center. It also had a sort of acid feel in the mouth, like fake vanilla, even though it says it uses real vanilla beans.<br /><br />It's good coffee, though. Quite strong, quite potent, and well-ground, it works in any coffee maker and it doesn't take much to make a nice, strong cup of coffee. It's just not for me. I'd recommend cutting this with another plain coffee, to minimize that strange vanilla flavor.<br /><br />If you like vanilla, you'll probably like it. Me? I think I'd rather just order a mocha.

review/summary: Not much vanilla, dark roasted taste.
review/text: I'll start by saying that I'm not a lover of dark roasted coffees, which is all Starbucks makes.  I find the flavor a bit harsh and bitter.  I prefer a light or medium roast, like Green Mountain coffee.  If you like dark roast however, you will probably like this coffee.  It has the typical dark, rich taste that is the signature of Starbucks.  The vanilla is very subdued.  I think most would have trouble distinguishing this from regular Starbucks coffee once it is brewed.  It does have a slight vanilla aroma however before brewing.

review/summary: If It's Starbucks, Doesn't It Have To Be Good?
review/text: Starbucks has created Infused coffee with natural flavors added into the coffee. The first thing that I noticed is that the coffee smelled like normal coffee with a hint of vanilla in it. Usually what I open a bag of flavored coffee, there is the over powering scent of whatever flavor coffee it is. When I brewed it, it was the same thing, just a hint of vanilla.<br /><br />Just like the smell, the coffee tasted the same way. It was a good, smooth coffee with just enough vanilla to make it interesting without over powering. I recommend this to anyone that likes coffee. Was a great change from regular coffee!!<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: Not A "Starbucks" Junkie But I LOVED This Premium Coffee!
review/text: First of all, I brew a lot of teas and coffees at home.  I grind my own coffee beans, have my own herb garden and use loose leaf teas 95% of the time.  I live in a rural area that doesn't have a Starbucks on every corner.  I have to travel 35 miles to the nearest Starbucks and even then I am loathe to spend $5.00 for a cup of coffee, Starbucks brand or not.<br /><br />However, I thought this coffee was some of the best ground and flavored coffee that I had ever brewed at home.  I LOVE vanilla and when you open the package you can even SEE the ground vanilla bean in the coffee.<br /><br />The coffee was very smooth and sweet and I just really loved the REAL ORGANIC vanilla taste.  When reading some of the other reviews, people said they couldn't taste or smell the vanilla in this coffee.  That's because most people are used to artificial vanilla flavorings or vanilla extracts (i.e. alcohol based) instead of whole bean vanilla.<br /><br />This coffee also has Indian Sarsaparilla Root as an ingredient. Sarsaparilla root comes from the sarsaparilla plant, a woody-climbing vine that grows in South America, the West Indies, Mexico and other tropical parts of the world. Sarsaparilla root has a pleasant fragrance and a spicy sweet taste that pairs well with the coffee bean used and the vanilla bean.<br /><br />All in all this coffee makes a lovely "cuppa" and I would DEFINITELY buy this coffee and serve it again!<br /><br />Happy Brewing!

review/summary: Typical Starbucks
review/text: As of this writing there have been 255 reviews posted. Sorta difficult to add anything new. I received one bag of this coffee from the Vine program. The day preceding its arrival I had brewed some French Vanilla by a brand that I regularly use and which is rated higher than Starbucks by the best known testing and rating org. This offered me an opportunity to make a somewhat taste comparison although, admittedly, the Starbucks was not French Vanilla.<br /><br />In the taste test Starbucks came in second. It was neither as smooth nor as tasty as the competitor. I drink my coffee with fat-free milk and no sugar so I get a fairly good opportunity to evaluate the taste. Starbucks afficionados undoubtedly will praise this and they have every right to do so and I have no quarrel with that. However, if you are not among that group I think you will find that you would be pleased with a different brand and save a few bucks as well.

review/summary: Is it necessary?
review/text: I'm not a big flavored coffee fan, but, for some reason, around the holidays it seems like I want to drink flavored coffee. Vanilla is my favorite, so when I got a chance to try this vanilla flavored coffee, I did it.<br /><br />It seems to me that every vanilla flavored coffee I've tried in the past did not really have a smooth vanilla flavor that I hoped for, and this one is no different. The vanilla doesn't seem to stand out or on its own. To me, the only way I can describe it is that the vanilla tastes "burnt."<br /><br />As a comparison, I tried adding Torani french vanilla syrup to my regular coffee. I liked that better. I think adding any type of vanilla flavor to regular coffee would produce a similar or better taste than buying it with the flavor already in it. So, is it really necessary to buy premixed vanilla flavored coffee?<br /><br />Maybe a coffee connoisseur would be a better judge of this coffee, but to me, the occassional flavored coffee drinker, this would seem a waste of money, especially since I doubt I'll use the whole package.

review/text: I'm going to admit I'm a coffee addict but not a Starbucks fan.  Assuming you like Starbucks coffee (if you don't know...just go to a shop before you buy a package), this is a drip grind, medium strength.  It's definitely not a French/Dark roast.  It wouldn't hold cream well at all without over-powering it.<br /><br />That said, there is barely ANY vanilla taste to hit although the grounds have a strong vanilla aroma.  In general, a hazelnut coffee has about 3x the flavored taste as this does.  Yes I do realize vanilla is a much more subtle taste.<br /><br />I would recommend either adding a drop of vanilla extract, shot of vanilla syrup or vanilla cream to your already favorite cup of joe.

review/text: I love flavored coffees, but in many of them the added flavor overwhelms the coffee flavor.  While I do enjoy flavored coffees, I still want to taste the flavor of the coffee, too.  This Starbucks Vanilla-flavored coffee is a perfect example of a flavored coffee that comes on so strong that almost obscures the coffee flavor.  Additionally, the vanilla flavor in this coffee has what I can only describe as a "chemical-edge" and aftertaste to it.<br /><br />I found it undrinkable served full strength, but mixing the grind with a regular coffee before brewing tones down and smooths out the flavor to a pleasant level. For my taste, mixing it at a 1-to-4 ratio (1 scoop Starbucks Vanilla to 4 scoops regular coffee, for example) worked very well.

review/text: I'm really impressed by this coffee!  Sometimes flavored coffees feature overpowering and fake-tasting flavoring that overwhelms the taste of the coffee itself.  This is not the case with Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored.  The beans were roasted just right, so the coffee smells rich, and when it's brewed it's just good coffee taste, without a hint of burnt beans.  The vanilla flavor isn't too heavy or so light you can barely taste or smell it.  It smells and tastes like the flavor you get from an actual vanilla bean, not a cloying, too-much fake vanilla flavor.

review/summary: Subtle Vanilla and Strong Coffee
review/text: This coffee has a very subtle natural vanilla flavor. The vanilla is probably less strong then most vanilla flavored coffee I've tasted. The coffee flavor is very strong, in-line with most of Starbucks other coffees. This is ground coffee, not beans. The recommendations on the package tell you to use two tablespoons coffee for every 6 oz. of water. This might be too strong for newbies, so you might want to cut that in half.

review/summary: Delicious Vanilla Flavor from Natural Vanilla Beans (No Fake Chemical Taste of Other Brands)
review/text: Starbucks French Roast (an unflavored, dark roast) is my favorite coffee which I buy in bean form and brew at home. I also enjoy splurging on fresh coffees from Starbucks coffee shops occasionally.<br /><br />I had not tried Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla until now, and am happy with this because it has a good vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Although I love the idea of vanilla flavored coffee, in the past, all the other coffee brands I've tasted which are served in restaurants, various coffee shops and take out restaurants (i.e. deli's and gas stations) had a fake chemical taste that I disliked. So in the past I avoided any flavored coffees.<br /><br />I have also tried some creamer products with vanilla and hazelnut flavors (not made by Starbucks) but those have a sweetner in them that has a strange, too-sweet taste for me.<br /><br />When I saw both the Starbuck's brand and the fact that this was a NATURAL vanilla flavor (made with vanilla beans) I decided to try it and I'm happy with it. It has a medium roast good flavor of Starbucks coffee with a vanilla taste that is not chemical-fake tasting and lacks odd aftertastes and the only sweetness is from whatever sweeter we choose to add.<br /><br />Bravo Starbucks! Your "Natural Fusions Vanilla" coffee is just right!<br /><br />Bonus: my package states (on the side) that  if we bring the empty bag to a Starbucks coffee shop within 30 days of the "best by" date they will give us a free 12 ounce freshly brewed coffee at no charge!

review/summary: Nice solution for flavored coffee lovers
review/text: I've found that Starbucks Natural Fusions has provided an ideal solution for on-the-go coffee lovers who don't want to settle for less. The ground coffee saves the time and hassle of grinding coffee beans; while the vanilla flavor adds just the right amount of flavoring. I really enjoyed the taste of this coffee!<br /><br />I like that Starbucks has made it possible to enjoy a quality cup of coffee with the least amount of time and trouble. Just brew, pour and drink!<br /><br />I highly recommend Starbuck Natural Fusions to everyone.

review/summary: Pleasant, But Ordinary Vanilla Coffee for a Cold Day
review/text: The doorbell rang on a frozen rain-rattled November afternoon. The postman left a box of Starbucks vanilla flavored ground coffee.<br /><br />Raggedly tired from the day, from the week, from the month, finding later autumn is rarely pleasant on its own merit, this was a good surprise. While plenty of coffee I had stocked in readiness for the first dismal days on winter, packages in the mail are like Christmas day presents. Eager, though already knowing what was inside, I smiled at the scent. Familiar. It reminded me of inexpensive coffee I bought before late novel-reading nights in college.<br /><br />Brewing quickly four cups, I poured the first taste into an old mug one of my first clients gave me, the one with pelicans on a sunny pier.<br /><br />Holding the mug with two hands, I sipped as anyone would hot coffee. Was it better, I wondered. No. Just ordinary. The vanilla was the same. The coffee was the same. Only the label was new. As it was already ground, it missed the freshness I can find even in any grocer who will grind the beans.<br /><br />I will finish the bag, and be glad I did, but having found nothing to compel me to look for it, I won't. If you have had vanilla flavored coffee, you have had this one.<br /><br />--Brockeim

review/text: I brewed up a pot of this great Starbucks coffee the minute I brought it in from the  mailbox.  It's a cloudy, dreary day here in the Ozarks and a cup of this coffee was the perfect and delicious "pick me up".  Another plus is that is takes less than the standard coffee as I found out when my first pot came out a bit too strong...not a problem...just added a little water.  I would certainly recommend this Vanilla flavored Starbucks blend.  It would even make a great Christmas gift.

review/text: I enjoyed the Starbucks Natural Fusions Coffee. I wish it was whole beans instead of grounds, but that's ok... it still tasted fresh. I did find, however, that it wasn't very tasty until I put what I consider to be too much sugar in it. Typically, I only put a tablespoon, but I had to put 3-4 in this because it had an unusual taste to it. It may be that I associate vanilla with sweet, but I thought it was worth mentioning.

Really nice being able to make it at home instead of having to go to Starbucks and you can make it as strong as you like. True vanilla flavor, tastes like what vanilla extract smells like.

review/summary: Excellent Vanilla Flavored Coffee!
review/text: About this review:<br />Let's face it. Any review about foods or beverages cannot be totally objective. It is usually subjective to reflect the type of taste enjoyed by the reviewer. We all have different ways to measure what tastes good to us and what doesn't. Some of us may enjoy strong coffee, while others may like it gentler. Some of us hate sour or bitter tasting coffee and others mask the taste totally by pouring so much creamer and sugar until it taste like something else.<br /><br />The Coffee:<br />This coffee has a nice aroma when open the bag. It is unmistakably vanilla flavored coffee. I followed Starbucks instructions on the bag and added 2 tablespoons for each 6 FL of water to my coffee machine. First impression was that the coffee is on the bitter side, but tastes like the good Starbucks coffee that you drink at any of their coffee shops. I added some sugar (I'm not a fan of masking the coffee taste by adding creamer)  and I took few sips. I decided to add a little more sugar (about 1 teaspoon per 6 ounce cup) and that tasted good to me. The vanilla taste is there. The strong slightly oily taste of a strong Starbucks coffee is all there. The next day I decided to make it slightly stronger, so I added 5 tablespoons for 12 ounces of water (instead of 4) and that seems to have all the elements I like about a good cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and you like Starbucks coffee and you also enjoy vanilla flavor, this is definitely a coffee worth considering!

review/summary: Smells Good, Tastes Good . . .
review/text: Since I drink my coffee black without any creamer or sweeteners, the taste of the coffee itself really matters to me.  This vanilla-flavored coffee comes ground, which saves me the step of grinding the beans myself.  Even though the beans are pre-ground, the flavor after brewing was still deep and rich, and the aromatic fragrance of vanilla still permeated after I opened the vacuum sealed bag.<br /><br />The flavoring of the vanilla in this coffee is subtle and mild.  I mention this because with some flavored coffees, a particular flavor can be quite distinct and strong, and dominate the taste of the coffee.  For me personally, that can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the particular flavor; I like pumpkin spice strongly flavored, while I prefer cinnamon and vanilla to be more subtle.  So, if you are looking for heavily flavored vanilla coffee, expect something a bit more subtle with this flavor.<br /><br />At 11 ounces, this is not a terribly large quantity of coffee for the money.  That said, however, Starbucks has never been the bargain hunter's choice for economical coffee, and this is reasonably priced in relation to other speciality coffees.

review/summary: Awful, just awful
review/text: My wife and I fancy ourselves coffee connoisseurs.  We use an expensive drip-brew machine, cold filters, specially filtered cold water, and fresh fine-ground coffee from Pete's.<br /><br />However, we also frequent Starbucks when traveling, and Seattle's Best, and even [shudder] Java City from time to time.  We have exacting standards which we use at home, but we are fine with (and even enjoy), the occasional cup of Starbucks coffee, etc.<br /><br />With that in mind, I when ahead and ordered this coffee sampler bag from Amazon Vine, figuring it might be an interesting trial.  It was interesting all right, but only in the "i can't believe they tried to sell that as a premium new product" sort of interesting.<br /><br />The grounds arrive dried out and brittle, I suspect freeze-drying was the culprit.  The bag is a cheap-seal bag, glued shut, and the feel and smell of the grounds screamed "cheap."<br /><br />But, even with those misgivings, I soldiered on.  Maybe the coffee those grounds produced wouldn't be THAT bad ... right?  It is Starbucks after all, they have a MINIMUM reputation they are trying to maintain ... yeah, I was wrong.<br /><br />The coffee produced from these grounds was bitter, acrid, and acidic.  The vanilla flavoring is obviously an additive that was poured on to the beans, and it also contributes to the bitter and acidic taste -- you can feel it in the back of your throat, and curdling the taste buds at the back of your tongue.<br /><br />Cream and sugar mask some of the unpleasantness, but only some of it.  The bottom line is this product is a cheap, freeze-dried coffee bean that has been sprinkled with the cheapest imitation vanilla "flavoring" they could find.  I have tasted real vanilla bean infused flavor, and also premium vanilla extract flavor, and this was not it.<br /><br />If you want vanilla flavored coffee, I would say your best bet is to buy quality beans/grounds, and brew them properly, and then add a shot or two of premium vanilla syrup, or keep a couple of vanilla beans in your coffee beans/grounds, and let the flavor infuse directly into the coffee before brewing.<br /><br />Stay away from this offering from Starbucks, it is just nasty.

review/summary: Downsized For Price?
review/text: As a buyer of this prior, I am somewhat surprised to see this once 1 POUND had been reduced to just 12 ounces the last time I bought. Now? Just 11 ounces? Aside from the shrinking amount of coffee for the price (leaves a bad taste in my mouth!), how about the coffee? Well, I really have a liking for anything vanilla from juicing, to smoothies and coffee too. When drip brewed, I find this coffee a bit too full flavored (slightly bitter to me) and add a bit of creamer to soften it a bit. I am not a huge coffee drinker since a recent heart attack and had to go to decaf so this new batch is for my wife. She doesn't care at ALL for this brand however unless she pours in about 3-4 ounces of dairy creamer (coffee-mate French Vanilla from Nestle) so the price is just crazy for me when I see how she "modifies it"! But this is from a guy who just drinks a cup of instant Folgers decaf every morning these days (sad I know).<br /><br />  So I have to defer to the connoisseurs on snob appeal and such. To me, it has always just been a nice cup of coffee before I was no longer able to drink with any caffeine. This brand was just one in a bunch of experiments I treated myself too after retirement before the heart attack. To ME, it is just an "average" coffee with an above average price. To be fair, remember I am not a big coffee person so this is perspective from an old guy who just was a casual drinker of coffee, not a fanatic. I just don't see the value given both my wife and myself added so much coffee creamer to get the desired taste of Vanilla? I still rate this 3 stars (average) since I may just not be the type of coffee drinker to "appreciate" something I just don't get. For what it's worth, I also prefer grilled hamburgers over grilled steak. And yes, beer over whiskey too.....No reason to beat up on a Company I really respect for it's success and quality treatment of their employees (but that's another story)!

review/summary: The Scent of Vanilla
review/text: Having already tried the caramel fusion and enjoying it, I decided to give vanilla a try.  I am not normally a fan of vanilla coffee as the smells is often more potent than the taste.  You can always tell when somebody has been in the room with vanilla coffee because the artificial scent lingers.  Whereas other vanilla coffees have the vanilla ending in the scent, this coffee has a nice mild taste that does actually hint of vanilla.  It is not a vanilla taste that overpowers the taste of the coffee like a sugary creamer, it is authentic and subtle.  The coffee even has a smooth mouthfeel that brings hints of creme soda.  Overall, this is a worthy addition to the Starbucks family.

review/summary: Strong Coffee with a Good Vanilla Flavor
review/text: Starbucks Vanilla Flavored Natural Fusions Ground Coffee features Arabica beans from Latin America and all natural flavors.  I first brewed this in an automatic drip coffee maker and awaited the results.  I was pleasantly surprised that the vanilla wasn't overpowering.  The results were typically Starbucks, strong but then a not so typical lack of bitterness with a hit of vanilla flavor. Excellent.<br /><br />I'll be the first to admit that I like flavored coffees but do not prefer Starbucks coffee.  To me, Starbucks is strong but too bitter.  This product, however, has the good strong blend without the bitterness and the bonus of Vanilla flavor.  I think this would be good for iced coffee drinks as well as homemade vanilla mochas and lattes.  I recommend this to Starbucks fans looking for a change and people who like strong, flavored coffee.

review/summary: Lousy flavor from the artificial vanilla chemical.
review/text: I got a free sample of this product (ground coffee beans) from the Starbucks company today (December 29, 2010).  The artificial vanilla flavor was NOT impressive.  It simply does not taste much like vanilla.  The added "vanilla" just provides some off-beat chemical flavor.  Even worse, is that this chemical flavor lingers on the metal coffee filter, and contaminates the flavor of any coffee that is subsequently brewed.<br /><br />Another overall problem with Starbucks coffee is that, in an attempt to imitate Peet's coffee, the Starbucks company provides a generous roasting of their coffee, but they over-roast their coffee to the point that the overwhelming flavor is one of charred or burned wood.<br /><br />Thus, for my 5-cup a day habit, I stick to Folger's, and when I want to treat myself, I buy Peets.  I am not sure why the Starbucks company is so successful, but I am sure it has MORE TO DO with their nice furniture, the creative nomenclature of their coffees, various other marketing gimmicks, and the endless selection of sugared, candied, confectioned, and embellished coffees, and LESS TO DO with the quality of the coffee itself.<br /><br />As a graduate student at U.C. Berkeley, I lived directly across the street from the first Peet's coffee shop, located at Walnut Square in Berkeley, California.  I first went to Peet's in the year 1973.

review/text: I love Starbucks.  I love vanilla.  So why didn't this work for me?  Why didn't this become my go to coffee in the morning, the one I would want to brew on cold evenings at home, the one that would accompany after dinner desserts with friends and family?  I really couldn't tell you.  I found the taste to be off, in that I didn't even think of vanilla as I drank it.  It also had a very bitter after taste that stuck with me for awhile even after only one sip.  I even attempted to add more milk and more sugar to decrease the vial flavor but amazingly it was like the coffee fought back, denying all my attempts at actually making something drinkable.<br /><br />I am sorry Starbucks, but this was a fail for me.  Actually threw out the bag so I wouldn't even have it in my kitchen.  I'll try again with something else perhaps not "natually fused".

review/summary: Ah-hhh... A pleasant "wake-me-up"...with or without creamer...
review/text: For me, half the pleasure of a good cup of coffee is the aroma while it's brewing. Since I love the scent of anything "vanilla," I decided to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003GTR8IO">Starbucks Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, Vanilla Flavored, 11-Ounce Packages (Pack of 2)</a>. With this special blend, Starbucks promises "a subtle flavor and pleasant aroma."<br /><br />I looked forward to having it before breakfast yesterday, so was pleasantly surprised to wake up to a most delightful vanilla bouquet. That flavor called out to me, so I followed my nose straight to the kitchen where my friend Lynn was quietly reading the newspaper and sipping a cup. She hopped up and poured one for me and before I could say "Thanks," she added a big splash of vanilla creamer. Ouch! She knows I generally add different flavors of creamer to my coffee, too, but I had wanted to test the "subtleness" promised in the ad--without any additives. Anyway, it was delicious with the creamer and I was pleased with the product.<br /><br />My true test of this natural fusions blend came this morning when I indulged myself by trying it a la naturale... Oh, my! What a taste treat! "Wow," I thought, "this is real coffee!" The vanilla was just the right amount to blend with the other natural flavors for a perfect cup of coffee. It pleases my palate as well as my olfactory senses... Can't beat that!<br /><br />As an additional test, I brewed a pot for another friend who generally enjoys stronger coffee. Although he liked it, he said it wasn't strong enough for him. So, if you like very strong coffee, this might not be the blend for you...or perhaps I should have added more coffee per cup. But then that would have been for him, not for me. And just how far should I go for a friend? Hmmmm...<br /><br />I have the open bag of coffee beside me as I type this review. I'm sitting here sniffing like a kid breathing in the aroma of a newly-baked cake. How's that for indulgence. :-)<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, December 10, 2010<br />Author of "Millennium Babe: The Prophecy," "Dream Reachers" (with Chase Von) and other books

review/summary: Not so hot.
review/text: I bought this for my wife who is an avid coffee drinker.  Here are her thoughts:<br /><br />As a coffee addict, I anticipated that this blend of ground coffee and vanilla beans would far surpass the cloyingly sweet fake vanilla coffee flavors currently on the market. My expecations were raised further upon opening the bag with the deep aroma of both vanilla and coffee bean. However, once the coffee is actually brewed, the vanilla is nothing more than a strange aftertaste--and not even a vanilla taste. The coffee itself is strong, as one expect with Starbucks brand, but it's not as full-bodied as their House Blend or other blends, such as Verona. Something just seems to be missing. I'm not sure if they're using a lower quality bean or the ground vanilla beans and/or Indian sasparilla root (the other ingredient in the blend) is throwing the balance of the coffee off. Or, maybe it's my perception of vanilla coffee being sweet; this coffee most certainly is not. I will stick with Starbucks House Blend for regular coffee, and if I'm in the mood for vanilla coffee, I would opt for Dunkin Donuts

review/summary: Truly engaging Vanilla flavor, but still over roasted
review/text: I want to preface this by saying I'm not a big fan of most of the Starbucks blends, though I am serious about coffee. I was pleasantly surprised and disappointed at the same time by this coffee.<br /><br />When you first open the bag the smell if of a surprisingly fresh and aromatic vanilla flavor. Upon inspection of the grounds you can see small bits of actual vanilla beans.  The aroma is great and better than traditional flavored coffees that use extracts that coat the beans or are roasted into them.<br /><br />I brewed the coffee using my Capresso 10-cup coffee maker with cold fresh water and a ratio of 1 tablespoon per 6 ounce cup of water.<br /><br />The coffee brewed with an aroma of coffee and vanilla. The vanilla dominated the brewing smells. First sip of of dark roasted coffee with a hint of vanilla flavor. I like the mild vanilla flavor. I love coffee and I usually don't like flavors masking the flavor of the beans. Roastmasters work hard to perfect their roasts and often times the flavors added destroy that. This is not the case with this coffee. The vanilla flavor augments the roast and adds to it, not takes away from it. The vanilla flavor is also fresher and more natural without the cloying artificial taste often associated with flavored coffee.<br /><br />My only beef with this coffee and with starbucks in general is that they often over roast their coffees to Italian roasts or beyond the second crack. I find this often masks complexities of the wonderful beans they use and substitute heavy mouthfeel and body for complexity. For that reason, I only give this coffee a four star rating.<br /><br />Another note is that this coffee seems to have plenty of caffeine. With only a cup or two, I feel the effects quite strongly, which is unusual because of the amount of coffee and tea I drink.<br /><br />Overall a good flavored coffee. Not overpowering and with a natural hint of vanilla flavor.

review/summary: The Rich Natural Sweetness Of Vanilla
review/text: Vanilla to me is like licorice: one of those flavors with so many artificial, bad-tasting imitations that it's a pleasure to experience the real thing.<br /><br />Starbucks new Natural Fusions line of flavored coffee may say 'a hint of vanilla' but to my taste, the natural flavoring is richly aromatic and full-bodied. I take  coffee with milk and no sugar; the vanilla adds just enough sweetness without detracting from the coffee itself.<br /><br />Many flavored coffees are over-flavored, probably on the assumption they're competing with large amounts of sugar. The vanilla in Natural Fusions complements the fine coffee taste rather than competing or overwhelming it. It's all about balance. You want to preserve the experience of the main component while taking it to a new level. I think Starbucks got it right here.<br /><br />If you're trying to cut down on sugar (or you know you should but aren't), give Natural Fusions vanilla a try; you may find you don't miss the sugar as much as you think.<br /><br />Instructions: Raise the cup to your lips, inhale, take a sip, inhale again. Repeat to your heart's content.

review/summary: Don't throw away that empty Starbucks coffee bag!
review/text: I must confess right up front that I'm not a coffee drinker, but everyone else in my family is, so this review is a composite of remarks and observations from all of them.  The vanilla aroma and taste is definitely there and yet is well balanced so it isn't overpowering.  This type grind worked very well in our cone shaped filter with a paper liner.  There were no grounds in the brewed coffee.  Even I could tell that this coffee had a very nice aroma while it was brewing, once again not overpoweringly vanilla.  Everyone agreed that this is what they would consider a mild roast (milder than the Pike's Peak as a point of reference), some experienced some bitterness while others did not.<br /><br />The overall opinion was that this was an enjoyable coffee which would be ideal for a specially brewed pot, but not for a standard get-you-going-in-the-morning pot.  It seems that my coffee drinkers want basic medium to strong coffee for that first cup of the day.  One really interesting thing I found on the package is that Starbucks will give you a free 12 oz cup of coffee if you take this empty bag to a Starbucks store before the expiration date for the coffee which is printed on the bag.  That might be standard procedure with all their bags of home brewed coffee but it was new for all of us.  It sounded like a great plus to my coffee drinkers.

review/summary: Is This Really Vanilla-Flavored???
review/text: I love a cup of Starbucks coffee, and I love a good flavored coffee. When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word "fusions" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards.

review/summary: Great flavored coffee.... only the Starbucks way
review/text: Flavored coffee sometimes tastes artificial.  This Starbucks Vanilla coffee smells great as it's brewing.  And the taste is great.  Not artificial.  And no aftertaste.<br /><br />Highly recommend this coffee if you like a bit of vanilla taste.  You can't go wrong.<br /><br />And enjoy the aroma as it brews.... so pleasing.

review/summary: Definitely Not a Favorite
review/text: I was excited to try Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee, and I ordered two bags of it.  The first pot of coffee is brewed and I am not pleased.  It has a great smell, but the taste is far from satisfying.  It is quite strong and bitter...actually almost has a Folgers taste.  Not at all what I expect from Starbucks!

review/summary: Sweet When Strong
review/text: I drink 6-10 ounces of coffee every morning from my excellent Jura-Capresso Machine. Usually I buy beans and they are ground in the machine. I've tried using already-ground coffee before and it didn't come out very strong, but with this coffee that was no problem!<br /><br />The flavor is nice. I drink it with French Vanilla creamer, and the overall effect is a rich vanilla coffee that tastes delicious. I've long been a fan of Starbucks iced and specialty coffees, never so much of just coffee, but it seems the trick is to have it at home-sweet-home.<br /><br />I brewed a pot once (using a different machine), and it came out not bad, but not great. The trick is to make it stronger to get the good flavor across (if you make it too strong, add some other coffee and that produces an excellent effect as well).<br /><br />Admittedly, the first couple times I tried this coffee I thought it was just OK, I can understand why some people don't like it. I still prefer my coffee beans (from CoffeeAM or Costco). After several tries I came to like the flavor, but next time I want to break up the routine with some flavored coffee I'll try a different flavor.<br /><br />As for the price, you can definitely find less expensive ground coffee, but in my opinion the price is good. For a cup of coffee with my Capresso machine, I used (roughly) 1.5 tablespoons of the coffee for a cup. With 22oz total package here (44 tbs) that means it should last roughly a month. $13 for a month of nice coffee - I can do that for quality flavored Starbucks grounds.<br /><br />It will depend on your taste, and I recommend you give this a go.

review/summary: Can't be called coffee
review/text: Can I give it no stars?<br /><br />The bag arrived and I was all excited. Coffee does that to me. I'm a coffee snob. There I said it. It's not the most expensive brand nor is it the exotic nature of the coffee that is my snobbery. I love a good strong cup of coffee. To me coffee is a experience for all your senses. This failed.<br /><br />The first moment the bag was in my hands I smelled it, a slight hint of vanilla through the packaging. The best coffee I have had always manages to smell like the addictive bean no matter how it's packaged. That is nothing to hold against Starbucks vanilla though. Great and even good coffee sometimes only release their fragrance after opening. When opened, the package gave a distinct smell of vanilla. So strongly in fact that my head popped back, it smelled like cheap vanilla perfume that I got as a child at the five and dime.<br /><br />I got down to business, packing my coffee maker, frothing the milk and setting out the mugs. Once the coffee was done the smell mellowed a little but still was not appealing. My first sip was confusion. It tasted like coffee made with old milk. I looked at the container of milk which was fresh. I dumped out all the coffee and cleaned the pot again. Second pot same thing.<br /><br />So I left it all for another day. I bought new milk, made my first cup from my favorite brand and it tasted wonderfully. The second pot I made from the starbucks bag. The same results the coffee tasted like it was made with old milk. It was tangy, off and repelling. I asked my friend to try it. No prompting from me and he asked "Something wrong with the milk? You want me to go downstair and get some?"<br /><br />3 tries from me and one with a friend, each cup was horrid. My regular coffee tasted great. The $1.99 a pound brand that my friend bought to "test" the pot and milk was a good solid cup of coffee.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and buy something else. This is horrible.

review/summary: Not very good
review/text: We got this Vanilla coffee hoping it would be a good coffee. Hubby brews the pot as one of those lovely breakfast in bed scenes. Smells good as it's perking in the pot. I smell the cup when he places at my bedside table. I cannot describe exactly what I was tasting...Perfume...Chicory...something not so good. Down the drain it goes. Thinking we might need to make it stronger....maybe it will taste good this time??? NOPE. Down the drain. Rinse pot. Add our usual Starbucks Beans for the next pot in anticipation of a good cuppa and it still tastes like the awful vanilla. I've had to send the pot through its clean cycle now. Tomorrow we will try our regular beans again and hopefully we won't be reminded of that awful vanilla.....

review/summary: Starbucks Vanilla Coffee????
review/text: How I was looking forward to good Starbucks Vanilla Coffee at home!  When I got the box with this coffee inside, the vanilla aroma was coming through the box!  Even the UPS man said "something smells good in there."  Opened the box and saw the bag and, it had that good coffee smell with vanilla added.  So good I had to read the directions and make some of this Vanilla starbucks!  The coffee came already ground, not full beans.<br /><br />Oh, I was counting on this being so tasty!  Making it, the aroma it gave off was good.  Drinking it, YUCK, yuck, yuck!  It had one of the worse tastes I've ever tasted.  Like a rubbery, strong, sour vanilla taste. Yes, I know Starbucks coffee is strong, but this is a nasty strong vanilla taste.  Well I dumped it all out, washed everything and the next morning made it again.  Also I had to get rid of that taste in my mouth through a regular cup of coffee!<br /><br />So the next morning I made another batch of this Starbucks Vanilla.  Took extra close attention to the directions to make sure I was doing everything right (which I was).  Tried one cup black, another with cream and sugar.  The same all times!  A terrible taste!  I don't know it's a bad batch of beans, or too much Vanilla was added or bad vanilla was added or what, but it's bad.  Even other family members agree on the taste.<br /><br />A note here.  I went to a Starbucks coffee house and asked the girl at the counter working.  Before I got far she said "that has to be from a grocery store, Starbucks took it off the menu a while ago."  I looked and sure enough it's not on the menu!  I asked why and she shrugged her shoulders.<br /><br />Well I was disappointed on this. Actually I'm surprised as I do not think this Vanilla Coffee represents the Starbucks name well.  I've had many different types of their coffee before and never have I tasted something this bad.

review/summary: Subtle flavor, but overall quite pleasant
review/text: The first thing I noticed about this coffee is that it smells amazing. It smells great in the bag and smells great brewed. It makes my house smell terrific.<br /><br />Drinking it, I found that it's smooth and drinks really easily. There's a little bit of bitterness (which I don't mind but some people might) and doesn't taste acidic at all to me, though I am not an expert coffee taster and might be getting my terms wrong. The vanilla flavor is really subtle. I could do with a little more vanilla, and I can see why people are dissatisfied with the slightness of the flavor. What little bit is present, though, is a really nice vanilla taste and not the aftertastey yuck a lot of flavored coffees have.<br /><br />I think I'm going to have my flavored-coffee-hating roommate try this too. (Edited to add: Roomie liked it, commenting that it didn't have that fakey syrup taste; roomie didn't like the strong vanilla aroma as much as I did, though.) This could be a good coffee to try if you like vanilla flavor in theory but find most vanilla-flavored coffees too strong or too fake-y.<br /><br />Overall I'm quite pleased with this coffee.

review/text: I am generally wary of flavored coffee, finding much of it to taste less like coffee and more like cheap perfume.  The Starbucks coffee is what it claims to be....a fusion of flavors that compliment rather than compete with each other.  It is smooth, fragrant and mellow, good as is or with a bit of cream.  Fine accompaniment to reading or conversation.

review/text: If you are buying this because you really like vanilla then you may want to skip it because it has a very light vanilla taste, you might not even notice the vanilla after the first sip.  This was what I was hoping for personally and did not want the vanilla to overpower the coffee because I like Starbucks coffees.  Recommended for people looking for light vanilla taste but not recommended for those wanting a strong vanilla taste.

review/summary: Fairly strange taste
review/text: I don't know what the odd taste is. It smells lightly of vanilla, and I've never brewed Starbucks at home before, so maybe all their coffee tastes this way, but there is an acrid, almost chemical aftertaste to each mouthful of this. I smell a decent basic medium roast, but I taste burning and something very off. The vanilla is weak, but strong enough to ruin the cup.<br /><br />I got this from the Vines program, and I'd never buy it again. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and this simply isn't worth the brewing, even if it was free. I've had better results from grocery-store brands that were pre-ground and on the shelf for who knows how long.

review/summary: THEY CHANGED THE ROAST!!!  So DISAPPOINTED!
review/text: UGH!  I had just discovered the rich roasted with slight vanilla flavor and then I buy a second bag and was shocked to see the light roast of any cheap flavored coffee.  I called in to their customer service and of course they didn't know what I was talking about.  I love Starbucks for the rich bold roast and now this new version is just like the Dunkin Donat or other flavored water that they pass off as coffee.  I realize they are probably trying to get those customers that like crappy brown water but come on Starbucks remember your BRAND IDENTITY!!!!!

Like most Starbucks coffee, these beans are a dark roast. The taste is smooth, but the vanilla flavor didn't seem to add much to the overall coffee taste. In fact, I hardly even noticed the vanilla when tasting the cup. The vanilla is most noticeable as an aroma when brewing the coffee, which is actually kind of nice.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was okay, but I'd rather just stick to regular coffee.

I am sensitive to that sort of thing since we don't go for BOLD flavors, but eat more naturally. I won't say however that it tastes bad. No, I still thought it tasted good and made a nice change. Just wouldn't want it for a whole two weeks worth of coffee.

I do like the occasional hazelnut or vanilla flavors.  I was hoping to have a hint of the flavor, not an overwhelming one.  I was not disappointed.  The smell of vanilla was a lot stronger than the actual taste.<br /><br />The coffee was good, not great or otherwise outstanding, but good.  I'd call this an easy drinking coffee and I feel I could serve it without mentioning that it was vanilla flavored.  All in all, it's a good coffee with a *hint* of vanilla.

review/text: When I first opened the bag of coffee, I was delighted by how noticeable the vanilla was. The coffee was evenly ground, and at about the right texture for a drip coffee maker. Though not quite as fresh tasting as coffee you grind yourself, it still had a rich flavor with a medium body. It's a very mellow, drinkable coffee. Like most flavored coffee, the specific flavor (in this case vanilla) comes out more in the scent of the coffee than in the flavor, but both are quite nice.

review/summary: Not too far off the standard vanilla flavored coffee
review/text: Lots of people don't care for the Starbucks roasts, but I happen to really enjoy them. This coffee has the standard Starbucks "taste" to it, so if you are one that does not care for the roasts in their stores, you probably would not enjoy this coffee, either.<br /><br />What I did not care for in this coffee was the strong vanilla syrupy smell. The aroma alone was a little strong for my liking and left that syrupy smell in my house for most of the day after brewing. A little could have been nice, but it was overly sweet. Compared to the smell, the vanilla infusion did not have as overwhelming a flavor, but my palate would still have prefered more subtlety in flavoring . If you are sensitive to strong sweet smells, you might also find this unpleasant. I think the smell impeded my ability to enjoy the taste, and may contribute to my ho-hum impression of this product.

review/summary: Wonderful vanilla scent..........
review/text: I typically am not a huge fan of Starbuck's coffee because it is a little too strong and a little bitter for my taste; so, I wanted to try this thinking it would be slightly milder in flavor.  The smell of this coffee when first opened was amazing.  The vanilla scent was very pleasing to the nose.  The coffee however did not carry the same strong vanilla flavor that the smell had.  My husband who does not like flavored coffees does not mind this flavored coffee at all.  He can taste a slight hint of vanilla which he does not mind.  The flavor for me is not strong enough but I can still use my flavored creamers which is enhanced with the vanilla infused coffee.<br />Basically this coffee is a matter of taste preference.  For us it turned out to be a coffee we both can enjoy.

Perhaps there is some variability in the process (or age of the product) that is causing this.<br /><br />If you're looking for a flovoured coffee, you might want to check out something else.

review/summary: Good to the last drop
review/text: Makes an excellent cup of coffee.  The vanilla flavor is not too overwhelming as to detract from the overall taste of a really good cup of coffee.  Also, a little goes a long way.  This is fine grind (no pun intended)and it doesn't take much coffee to make a 10 cup pot.  Enjoy!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CRRWFG">Mr. Coffee CGX23 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker, Black</a>

review/summary: Another Starbucks Winner
review/text: My entire family enjoyed drinking the Starbucks Natural Fusions coffee after dinner in which we celebrated the birthday of "Grandma."  We had two coffee pots going: one with this delicious vanilla-flavored coffee and another with a different brand.  It was soon easily determined which coffee was the favorite as we quickly had to brew a second pot of the Starbucks. When you drink this coffee, be prepared to enjoy the combination of fine ingredients that make this such a tempting drink. I enjoy  most all Starbucks flavors but this one is extra delicious.  Be sure and try it soon.

review/summary: Really Tasty!
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, don't typically pay to have my coffee from Starbucks, and am quite content to drink my ground coffee from the Eight O'Clock brand.  The Starbucks Vanilla Natural Fusion variety came on my radar because of a promotion making the price very reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, the vanilla is spot-on perfect.  It doesn't taste fake or artificial in any way.  It's also strong enough that you know it's there (aroma and taste), but it's not overpowering in any way.<br /><br />The best part, however, is the bag.  Why you ask?  Because written on the side of Starbucks packaged coffees are instructions that the empty bag can be traded in at any Starbucks location for a free cup of coffee!  Not bad at all!  Enjoy it ground... then go get yourself a free cup while you're out shopping!

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: Wow. I bought this coffee on the Friday sale, and was totally surprised. And not in a good way. Let me say that I consider myself a coffee snob. I own a coffee shop, and we only sell the best stuff. I thought I would try this at home. It is absolutely disgusting, in my opinion. There is no vanilla to it, at all. If you want a really good cup of vanilla coffee- buy Dunkin Donuts french vanilla. We actually sell it brewed in the coffee shop, as I feel it's the best vanilla flavored coffee out there, period. Don't buy this stuff. Even on sale.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: I love this coffee.  It has the boldness of regular Starbucks coffee with a light vanilla flavor.  I love that it is not overpowered with an artificial vanilla taste like a lot of other brands.  This coffee is great if you love the bold flavor of Starbucks - however if you don't like a strong coffee, I would stear clear of this one.  I personally love Starbucks flavor and I love the natural vanilla flavor.  I brought this to work and my coworkers all agreed.  If you want a really sweet vanilla flavor, this is probably not for you.

review/summary: Overrated
review/text: I love coffee! I'm always trying new brands & flavors so when I saw that Starbucks came out with the natural fusions I thought I would give it a shot. I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees, but I'm willing to try them. This was a waste of money! The flavor was not good & it left a horrible after taste. It was like getting a cheap cup at hospital or gas station. I ended up throwing it away.

review/summary: Definitely NOT the "Original" Necco
review/text: My order arrived promptly but unfortunately NECCO decided to change the recipe of a long time favorite and their new "original" wafer is not at all like the true "original".  The true original had great flavor and color, the new original is tasteless and faded pastel colors.  Necco should re-label their new recipe product to avoid confusion.

review/summary: awful candy
review/text: I have been a Necco wafer lover for most of my life-and still am-even at the age of 65!<br />But, I WILL NOT EAT THIS DISGUSTING STUFF!<br />They have ruined Necco wafers-I can't even tell what the flavors are! I quit buying them and will continue to do so until they bring back the right ones-the GOOD ones.

review/summary: Beet Powder and Purple Cabbage?
review/text: Beware.  These are NOT the original Neccos!  Neccos went "all natural" in 2009.  Lime could not make the transition, so now there are 7 flavors instead of 8.  And the remaining 7 do not look like or taste like the original Neccos. They're faded in color, and I can barely discern white from purple from yellow from orange.  The flavors are just "off".  Not sure why they felt they needed to go "all natural".  I mean it is candy after all.  And the main ingredient is still sugar.  If you remember and loved Neccos, I urge you to contact them at necco.com and let them know how you feel.  Beet powder and purple cabbage in candy.  Who ever heard of such a thing?
