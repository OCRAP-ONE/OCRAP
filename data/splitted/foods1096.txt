review/summary: Excellent product, great price.
review/text: I've tried various kinds of Carob powder, from really Raw, to very dark Roasted. This one is in medium-dark. It's just the right kind of roast to make a good chocolate-substitute. Mine was not bitter at all, so I don't know if the previous reviewer was more sensitive, or if they got a different batch. I'd rate this as one of the better Carob powders I've ever used.<br /><br />The quantity is also quite amazing. This is a four-pack, with each bag at 1 pound, 2 ounces. Altogether that's four and a half pounds of carob powder! For this price, it is an exceptional deal. I'll try to attach a picture...

review/summary: Great Product, Great Company
review/text: We use a ton of carob at my home. We substitute it for chocolate in a lot of baked goods, and we use it for "chocolate" milk for my toddler - carob powder, a bit of raw honey, and milk blended up in our Vita Mix. We've used carob powder from local health store bulk bins and Bob's Red Mill, and we really prefer Bob's. It just seems more fresh. I love the packaging - one package fits well in our mason jars which is how we store it once it has been opened.<br /><br />Like most Bob's Red Mill products, this one is good quality, and I trust it is from a good source.

review/summary: The Bitter Carob
review/text: This carob is toasted.  I previously had tried the Now brand carob that is roasted.  I don't know if the toasting/roasting makes a difference in the end product or if this carob was just bitter to begin with.  It tasted bitter almost like coffee.  For those trying to find a coffee alternative, this would make a suitable alternative...a hot carob drink.  The Now brand  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO68F2/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001EO68F2&linkCode=as2&tag=amazonoption-20 is pretty sweet on it's own and has almost some caramel notes to it.  This Bob's brand does not.  It reminds me of regular cocoa powder.  You can still use it as a chocolate alternative, although it does not have any depth in flavor like the Now brand does.  I guess I know not to buy this brand next time.

review/summary: Makes delicious brownies!
review/text: I am new to baking with carob powder, but I purchased this based on the other positive reviews. My first batch of brownies was a success! I used about four parts carob powder to 1 part cocoa to keep a little bit of true chocolate flavor, but cut back dramatically on the caffeine. As a bonus, it's not as bitter as cocoa, so you don't need to sweeten as aggressively - my brownies were fine with just stevia. Carob brownies are just a little bit fruitier than cocoa, in a nice way. This is a large amount of carob powder, so if you're not sure you like it, maybe try some out first before buying this much...

review/summary: Excellent Product for Those Seeking a Healthier Cracker
review/text: I was a little wary after reading the reviews of this and other Ryvita products about expiration dates or whole boxes that were in pieces rather than whole crackers. I ordered anyways and I am glad I did. Only one box had a few broken crackers, everything else was intact and delicious. I ordered in January and they don't expire until August, which is plenty of time to consume them all.<br /><br />The crackers themselves are crispy and have a ton of whole pumpkin seeds baked right in, which is nice because I was expecting a small amount, like the tiny amount of nuts that are usually in a chocolate bar with nuts. But this was not the case, making the already-low subscribe and save price even better.<br /><br />The crackers are a little on the dry side, so be sure to enjoy them with a glass of your favorite beverage or perhaps a piece of fruit. I like to eat one in the morning with yogurt, which takes care of the dryness. Overall they taste have a slightly nutty and grainy taste and would be great with spreads or cheese.

review/summary: AWESOME crackers!
review/text: I feel for the reviewer who got pieces and crumbs rather than whole crackers, but I gotta tell ya--these crackers are TERRIFIC.<br /><br />First of all, they are so light. You bite into them, and they just break apart so easily, then remain crunchy as you happily munch away.<br /><br />There's no shortage of pumpkin seeds, and the taste is just right--neither salty nor sweet, perfect for ANY kind of topping (just don't pick anything too heavy; these aren't strong enough for, say a huge pile of meat and cheese).<br /><br />I top mine in a variety of ways:<br /><br />1) with MaraNatha organic no-stir peanut butter and Crofter's organic super fruit spread;<br />2) with goat cheese and bruschetta topping (chopped tomatoes, basil, and onion, with a splash of red wine vinegar and olive oil--and don't let too much liquid get onto the cracker, or it will break); or<br />3) soft cream cheese and chopped olives.<br /><br />Yumscrumarama!<br /><br />(Additional kudos to Ryvita for their fruit crispbread, which  last time I checked was still not available again on Amazon, but which hopefully will be.)

review/summary: Good crackers but mine were also stale
review/text: I like Ryvita and can't stop eating their crackers once I open a box.  However, this order arrived smelling and tasting stale.  I kept them and would toast them and cover with cream cheese, etc.  I think they are a healthier alternative to other crackers.<br /><br />Amazon has a quality issue on many foods, apparently.  They seem to have "sales" when items are close to expiring.  This isn't the first time I've had something that was stale nor do I think it will be the last.  Unfortunate.  Just beware.

review/summary: Pumpkin Seeds Spoil Quickly...So Did These Crackers
review/text: I bought these crackers when they were marked down on Amazon, but I was extremely disappointed upon opening a box to discover that the crackers were rancid!  The replacement shipment was no better - still spoiled.  I think this is an inherent problem with the pumpkin seeds, as pumpkin seeds apparently spoil very quickly.  When I picked off the pumpkin seeds (embedded in the crackers), the rest of the cracker smelled/tasted fine.  But obviously, I can't do that with all of the crackers, since the pumpkin seeds are really baked in there.  Since I think this is a defect with the product, I can't recommend these crackers.

review/summary: Healthy and Flavorful
review/text: I was diagnosed as insulin resistant, and while it hasn't been too hard to adjust my eating there are two things I couldn't find a substitute for: bread and crackers. I missed my sandwiches and crackers with cheese, but these crispbreads are perfect. I have this flavor as well as the sesame and oat, but I rather the pumpkin seed. They are crunchy and filling and work great to make an open faced "sandwich" or with a bit of goat cheese or nut butter spread on them. One slice is all it takes to fill me; for lunch all I need is one with some toppings. I bought these in the store and while my first cracker was broken, the others were not and have not broken on me, though I usually spread cheese on them while they are on a plate and not in my hand. It seems like the mailing system might be a bit too rough for them, but perhaps you can call the company and see if they sell  them in local stores near you.

review/summary: Good for almost any meal
review/text: I bought these crispbreads because I decided to start using good quality crackers instead of bread. When I buy bread, it tends to go unused except for a few slices. Yet, sometimes you need something to hold butter, meat, or cheese. These crackers work very well for that; they don't overpower the food and they are tasty.<br /> I did not think the crackers arrived stale. However, they do taste different than crispy, toasted crackers, if that is what you expected. I have bought Ryvita in many different supermarkets and small groceries and they always have this taste. They are thicker than what you might expect, and somewhat bland. They have taste because of the toppings that are baked into them. They are not salty, they are crispy-crunchy. They never are and I don't think they are supposed to be. They are not like saltines. They are not like Ritz crackers.<br />  They are very good, though. They have their own unique taste and texture.

review/summary: convenience packs ROCK!
review/text: I'm writing about the single serving convenience packs, offered in a 24-count case, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCVLX6">Walkers Shortbread Fingers, 2-Count Cookies Packages (Pack of 24)</a>, which are also available with Subscribe and Save.  They're amazing!  Here's why:<br /><br />1  Yes, as everyone says, these Walker cookies are exceptional.  You may think it's all just buzz, but if you haven't tried them, don't judge us as silly until you do (!).<br /><br />2  But what happens if you open a box -- you finish it, right!  BAD.  These little suckers aren't the greatest thing for you, to put it mildly.<br /><br />3  Answer:  single serving packaging!!  It really works.  My husband is addicted to these cookies.  I'd always have a box on hand in case of unexpected guests -- at least, I'd think I had one, but the box would usually have disappeared unexpectedly whenever I went to look for it.  True confessions:  I love them too and was occasionally looking to sneak some for myself!  So having them around just in case was a bad, BAD idea.  But a case of 24 packs of 2 cookies per package is ideal.  Two seems to satisfy my husband's craving -- he almost never takes more than one packet.  And I open a packet occasionally and make 2 cookies last 2 days, instead of a whole box lasting almost forever and my worrying that they'd go stale or attract ants.<br /><br />Bonus:  they're easily packable!  When my husband's expecting an exceptionally tough day at work, I'll usually sneak a pack into his lunch if he hasn't already appropriated one for himself.<br /><br />And when he's especially wiped out at the end of an unusually demanding day, a pack of these really seems to perk him up and help him muster strength for tomorrow.  He brings it upstairs while he's watching TV and waits a while before opening the bag and savoring his treasure.  Whether for lunch or after dinner, the gleam in his eye as he talks about how wonderful it is to have a treat when he's so stressed means a lot to me, especially when I know he's only eating in moderation instead of wolfing down ten or twenty servings at a time.  The case of 24 has lasted us 3 months already -- a pleasant surprise, given that there are 2 addicts in the house.  :  So our portion-control strategy is working!!!<br /><br />And yes, when we had guests who chose after-dinner tea, these were just the right thing to bring out with it, and I didn't mind opening multiple packs at once and putting the cookies together on 1 plate for serving, knowing that I wasn't either spoiling an entire box, or promoting too rapid consumption of it, just by providing our guests with a few.<br /><br />I wish two other treasures came in single-serving packets:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K8WI1Q">Mary's Gone Crackers, Caraway, 6.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>!!<br /><br />STRONGLY RECOMMENDED.

Buying in 24 x 2 fingers [1.4 oz] to the pack is #1 - a lot cheaper than buying in the 5 oz package, and #2 - and most important, you are not tempted to eat the whole 5 oz package you've just opened.

review/summary: Amazing little thing called Shortbread Fingers!
review/text: I have to admit that this shortbread is way too addictive.<br />I'm not particularly interested in snacks, but the rich and butterly taste of shortbread that melts softly in the mouth won me over.<br />I found the same walkers shortbread in the grocery store near home, the price was twice expensive than this one in Amazon.<br />I'm very happy that I found this from Amazon. Great deal!

review/summary: Snack Chip Heaven
review/text: Gluten-free, vegan, and they taste outstanding. These are multi-grain, lightly salted, triangle-shaped chips.<br /><br />They are:<br />* Non-GMO<br />* 100% Organic<br />* Loaded with Omega 3's<br />* No synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers<br />* No trans fats or high fructose corn syrup<br />* No artifical flavors, colors or preservatives<br />* Because they're vegan they naturally have No Cholesterol (cholesterol only comes from animal products)<br /><br />They have a wonderful crunch. And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

My wife is Jamaican and we have been to Jamaica a few  times, but I never seem to bring back enough coffee so  I set out to find a brand here in the states that would be atleast close to what you get in Jamiaca and this is it.

I've tried this through the coffee pot (using permanent gold filter) and through french press and it's absolutely wonderful. Sweet, nutty, fruity, everything it's made out to be. worth every penny. Such a wonderful cup of coffee. I usually like mine with cream and sugar and with this cup I didn't need either. Try it black with a small amount of sugar. Excellent. Someone suggested cutting this coffee with Kona. Wrong, wrong, wrong. This coffee doesn't need to be cut by anything. It stands up on its own and if your friends didn't notice any difference in the coffee they were driking you either a) made it wrong, or b) have friends with little to no taste buds.

review/summary: It's Okay ...
review/text: Purhcased this for Christmas Dinner and shared with family. No rave reviews from anyone. Usually everyone enjoys our coffee but no one, not a one, commented on this brew (which isn't a good thing). We ground the beans right before roasting, tried a few different racios and realized that you need an extra amount of coffee per cup to give it flavor. Flavor is what we're after as coffee people but, this fell short of the rave reviews on Amazon. We never told anyone at Christmas Dinner about the coffee so we would get a "clean" report. Got nothing back and that's not good. For ourselves, we didn't find anything but flatness in this. It might be good to cut this with Kona. We're going to try that out. This is far too expensive to throw out so we have to find a way to enjoy it. We have used other Blue Mountain coffees and love it.  We do NOT recommend this particular coffee.

review/text: My dad used to buy Jamaica blue mountain when I was a little girl. He got sick not too long ago and was in a coma for a while. When he woke up, I had to go back home, but I sent him a care package for when he got home. This was in there. Not only was he amazed I remembered this was his favorite, but he was amazed that it tasted as good as he remembered it! He had a heart attack a few months later and died, but I'm grateful I was able to remind him of one more good memory before he passed. I wasn't able to try it, but my mom still raves at how great it was, and how much my dad liked it.

review/summary: Jamaica Blue Mountain, the very best.
review/text: If you are only starting your trek into the world of serious coffee appreciation, then I highly suggest you, without haste, purchase one pound at least of whole bean JBM. Also a good grinder, a temperature controlled machine and a decent water filtration system. Pre-ground takes much of the flavor away, compaired to properly done fresh home ground coffee, and coffee is lessened without being prepaired at the correct temperature of filtered water.<br /><br />But why something so expensive? Why jump in to the deep end of the pool before even getting your feet wet?<br /><br />Some may scoff, saying that only a true coffee fanatic would understand or be able to appreciate this blend. That is entirely true. But how can anyone really understand without first having tasted the standard by which all others must be judged?<br /><br />Thus why this review is only four out of five stars. You see, JBM is so subtle, so complex, that a new tounge will not notice what makes JBM quite so wonderful.<br /><br />It is a "perfectly" blended coffee. Flavor, bitterness, acidity and aftertaste. On a scale of one to ten, they all rank dead even at five. Every other coffee is like a exaggeration of this hard to get bean.<br /><br />This should be the first coffee to ever cross the lips of anyone who wants to learn these things. How else can you truely understand the other blends?

review/text: I mean this stuff was roasted how long ago? A far lesser coffee roasted a couple of days ago is going to taste a whole lot better. At $50 per pound, what you're tasting is justification for spending the money. What you should do, if you have the money for this sort of coffee, is buy a coffee roaster and start getting good green beans (including Jamaican Blue Mountain) and roasting them fresh yourself. The folks at Sweet Maria's have all the info you need to get started.

review/text: CAMPBELL'S HEALTHY REQUEST CREAME OF MUSHROOM (Soup) 10.75-OUNCE CANS, (PACK OF 24), contains a tasty blend of mostly-natural ingredients.  However, if you have had the regular Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup, you will not be as satisfied with this soup as you otherwise would have been.<br /><br />The regular Campbll's Cream of Mushroom Soup IS tastier.  It is also thicker, and has less water.  Howeever, it has more sodium, and more calories.<br /><br />As the saying goes, you pay your money and you take your choice!<br /><br />It's good to have BOTH types on hand, I think -- and use them alternately, or half-and half!  Both are good tasting.  The regular soup tastes better, though.  And the Healthy Request has fewer calories and sodium.

I use it as a creamy sauce straight from the can, heat it in the microwave, add a little fake salt, some ground peeper and maybe some grated Parmesan cheese and it's a very nice meal with some pasta. These are easy-open cans, which is nice, too - don't have to use a can-opener. I used subscribe and save, so the price is good. And by ordering from Amazon, I don't have to lug the stuff home from the stores myself. Gave 4 points instead of 5 only because it's a little boring - but that's what cream of mushroom soup is all about, isn't it?

review/summary: I Found This Delicious Coffee When I Visited New Orleans In June
review/text: I visited my son who lives close to New Orleans, I got up early and made a pot of coffee, it was so delicious I think I drank the whole pot!!!  It was Community Coffee!!  I have been drinking Folgers for years, now I drink Community Coffee with Chicory delivered by mail from Amazon.  There may be a lot of other more expensive coffee's but in my opinion none tastes better than Community Coffee!!  You may have heard that Chicory makes coffee bitter, not so with this one, unless you make it too strong.  It is very smooth and delicious,especially with a little French Vanilla creamer, try some, you'll be glad you did!!

review/text: Chicory must be an acquired taste and not for the average regular coffee lover because this flavor is horrible.  I have to say that Community coffee in general is by far the worst coffee I've ever had, and I drink lots of coffee.  I've tried the Community coffee cafe blend and dark roast as well.  I don't think my expectations were high either, I got them free with a coupon.  I drank it for a few days in a row during my commute to work, but in the end I decided life's just too short for bad coffee.  I would stick with Starbucks, Caribou, New England, or Eight O Clock.  Sadly, Folgers or any other brand coffee really I would say is better than Community Coffee.

review/summary: Great Product from a great company The Ginger People
review/text: I first discovered the Ginger people Christmas of 2005. A friend picked up a bottle of Ginger Peanut Sauce from T.J. Max, as they knew I liked ginger. I cooked with it, making things like Asian snap peas, which my friends started requesting at pot luck get togethers. (They thought I spent hours making them) Sadly my bottle was running out.  I looked on line to try to find more and ran across the Ginger People's website. I ordered a half a case of the Ginger Peanut sauce, and decided to try a couple of their other sauces. (All of which are excellent by the way)<br /><br />The website offered "ginger chews" which I'd bought before from Trader Joe's under Trader Joe's branding. So I ordered a couple of bags of those as I knew I liked them.<br /><br />By having my order reach a certain amount, the shipping was greatly reduced.<br /><br />Being short of the amount, I decided to try the Gin-Gins, even though I'm not a hard candy kind of guy.A few months later, I was glad I did, however, as one of my new medications gave me dry mouth during the afternoon and when I talked a lot.  I was able to put a Gin-Gin in my mouth which kept me from having dry mouth or having to chew on a Ginger Chew during meetings.<br /><br />I recently had another new med introduced, which has a side effect of nausea, the ginger chew helps calm that down, but isn't always convenient, like at meetings, socializing, or other types of interactions with others.  Gin-Gins to the rescue again.<br /><br />If you're prone to having an upset stomach, I can't think of too many , if any better way to settle that stomach down than a true ginger based product.  Gin-Gins are the perfect all around, right in any setting answer.<br /><br />When taking one out of my pocket, friends, co-workers, or clients, have asked to have one. I've yet to get anything put positive responses for Gin-Gins taste. So for anyone who just likes hard candy, Gin-Gins sure seem a winner with everyone I've shared with.<br /><br />Try them, (and other fine selections from the Ginger People) you won't be disappointed.

review/text: I am a new lover of Gin Gins hard candy!!  I am newly pregnant (7 weeks) and the morning sickness, which for me is all-day sickness, began a few days ago.  I feel aweful, AWEFUL.  As soon as I found out I was pregnant I stocked up on anything that might help with the impending nausea - PsiBands, Preggie Pops, Ginger tea, Gin Gins.  The PsiBands don't seem to work for me but the ginger candy is AMAZING.  (The Preggie Pops work pretty well too.)  I feel almost normal while I'm sucking on it.  I don't know how or why but, seriously, after about 30 seconds of popping a ginger candy in my mouth I feel SO much better.  I'm probably going to destroy my teeth by sucking on candy all day but for now it is definitly worth the relief.  Thank you to everyone who rated these highly and convinced me to try them!!  (My only complaint is that the candies are a little small and so seem to go fast.)

review/summary: Gin Gins Hard Ginger Candy
review/text: I found this product when I looked through a search engine to find natural ginger. I was taking a medication, that made me very sick to my stomache. Because of all the other medications I was on, my doctor was reluctant to give me another medication to address this side effect, so he suggested natural ginger. The first product I found was in a super market and it was ginger pieces that I would hold in my mouth, it worked ok, but one day I was in a super market and found some all natural ginger candy and that was great. I looked for it again to no avail. When I found these online, I was thrilled, but I was even happier when they arrived!!!! I would highly recommend these to anyone who is pregnant, or going through cancer treatments, motion sickness and of course side effects from medications. They are inexpensive and worth a million!!

review/text: From week 6 to week 12 of my pregnancy I threw up twice a day, and felt nauseous almost 24/7. I  took anti-nausea medicine, but still felt awful and was searching for any relief. These got good reviews so I ordered 2 bags. I didn't even finish half a  bag. They were ok, and somewhat took the nauseous edge away, but they weren't my first choice to try for relief. Honestly the best relief I got for morning sickness were sour icebreakers, and then lemonheads. I would buy these Gin Gins only if you enjoy ginger flavor and would eat them as regular candy anyways.

review/text: I am a "dyed in the wool" ginger-lover and looked forward to a veritable explosion of hot, spicy, tangy ginger in my salivating mouth.<br /><br />Bummer...what was delivered was a somewhat honey-flavored confection...that was merely bland in its intention.  Disappointing in demeanor...exhorbitant in cost.

review/summary: Less of a kick than the chews
review/text: I bought the ginger chews at the market a few months before trying these hard candies, and I was expecting the same potency. The chews really have a burn to them when you eat them. These hard candies are much more mild. I like both, but for something you can actually enjoy for a few minutes, these are great. Wish they were perhaps a LITTLE more potent though.

review/summary: Amazing!!!
review/text: Okay, I know this review might seem a bit premature, since I only received this product yesterday, but WOW! I am 6 1/2 weeks pregnant and have been having horrible, all-day morning sickness for about a week.  The minute I received these yesterday afternoon, I popped one in my mouth, and by the time I had finished sucking on it my nausea was 100 times better! Last night I was actually able to eat a real meal! This morning, I popped one in as soon as I woke up, and was able to eat a real warm breakfast (my nausea has been so bad I have seriously been limited to saltines and plain bread).  I know every pregnancy is different, but if you are suffering from nausea and vomiting like I was, you owe it to yourself to give these a try!

If I could find them in a store I would, but I don't mind, it's a good price and I can't drive so I like the delivery and very prompt.

review/text: These candies are spicy like cinnimon, but of course don't taste like cinnimon.  Not quite as intense as a spicy cinnimon candy either.  I got them because I am pregnant and experiencing nausea.  They do take the edge off!  One thing that bummed me out was I found 2 wrappers that were sealed up with no candy inside.  Other than that, they are ok.  Not something I would eat all the time, but it does help take the edge off my nausea.  I would reccommend to other pregnant women!

review/summary: Gin Gins Hard Candy
review/text: I first tasted Gin Gins when I was leaving a restaurant in Manhattan and took a few to go. They were refreshing and seemed to settle my stomach after the big meal I had just eaten. The next time a friend said she was going to that same restaurant, I asked her to bring me some. After that I had to have them so I went on Amazon. Gin Gins are delicious with just the right amount of ginger taste-not too overwhelming, but very soothing. Try them!

review/text: I was looking for anything to ease my pregnancy nausea.  I read good reviews about these candies, so I promptly ordered them.  Although they don't really take the nausea away, they do provide a somewhat soothing relief and take the edge off a bit.  I've found that with my pregnancy sickness, I often get a yucky taste in my mouth after I eat, but chewing gum makes me feel even worse for some reason.  These at least leave a pleasant taste in my mouth.

review/text: I got these in an effort to combat the combination of morning sickness & carsickness on a two-day bus ride I was taking. I really wanted to like them, but the taste was absolutely awful. If you're thinking ginger flavor like ginger ale, this isn't even close. They were spicy and bitter and just plain icky - I tried twice, but couldn't keep one in my mouth longer than about 45 seconds. Bummed that I wasted the money on these, I could have bought Preggie Pops instead for the same price - and they actually taste good!! Would recommend ginger root capsules instead.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: On a recent ferry ride, the crew handed out Gin Gins to help passengers with motion sickness. I wasn't sick, but I took one anyway and have been looking for them in stores ever since! Finally I found them on Amazon and just ordered them here. I only just received my order today and I can't stop sucking on them. I have yet to use them on an upset stomach, so I can't attest as to how well they work for that, but just as a candy they're addicting and delicious! Shortly after the ferry trip, when I couldn't find them in stores, I got some crystallized ginger (not by The Ginger People,) thinking it would be about the same thing. It definitely wasn't. It only served to inform me that I actually don't like straight ginger much at all; it's way too strong for my taste. But this candy has the perfect amount of sweetness, and yet still the warm punch of ginger that makes it perfect. Delicious!

review/summary: Natural Flavors?  Shame on Walnut Acres
review/text: I saw the words Natural Flavors on the label of this bottle.  Since this notation is used to hide monosodium glutamate (MSG), a flavor enhancer, I called the number on the bottle.  The woman at Walnut Acres said the Natural Flavor included a vegetable extract but not MSG as the law requires the ingredient to be labeled if used. The law really states it is required by the FDA that food manufacturers list the ingredient "monosodium glutamate" on food labels, but they do not have to label ingredients that contain free glutamic acid, even though it's the main component of MSG. Glutamic acid is an extract of a seaweed which certainly is classified as a vegetable.  Glutamic acid is a slow killer which should be banned but I regret to say our FDA is not always acting in our best interests. What is also sad is that this company tries to pass this off as Organic.  I will add that the juice did not taste very good and certainly did not taste like cranberry juice.

If you know that is what you are getting, it is perfectly fine "cranapple" juice.  I used it in punches for a party, and it worked for what I needed.  I prefer my cranberry juices to be a little more tangy and vibrant; this is a little mild and bland for my taste.

review/text: Here's another one of Near East's delicious products, to provide a new kind of starch to your daily meals. These 5.6 boxes of couscous with pine nuts cook more quickly than rice --- in just five minutes. Here's a way for on-the-go families to quickly cook up a side dish to go with fish, chicken or red meat --- yet avoid rice and potatoes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in this case, it's another item that we have foregone lately. Near East makes delicious food. However, it gets quite expensive to eat on a daily basis, and we have opted for mixed rice and couscous varieties from other sources, for lots less. Especially when one is on an increasingly tight budget, every little bit adds up.

review/summary: This stuff beats up Rice-A-Roni and steals its lunch money
review/text: If you're a broke student, or just too lazy to go out to eat or cook real meals, this is the stuff you want. Throw in some frozen vegetables (shelled edamame, lima beans and peas are my favourites) and some extra pine nuts and mix it into a pot with the water and mix, and in 15 minutes you've got a fantastic meal with enough leftovers for tomorrow's lunch (or breakfast - no judgement here!). Sure, you could cook it as a side dish for a family dinner - but if you're looking at 15 minute rice/couscous mixes at the grocer, you're probably not cooking family meals.<br /><br />Anyway - five stars! Price is a bit high here though. I've seen it at 2 for $4 at my local grocer (I stocked up!). Pine nuts are delicious, couscous is delicious, and this mix is just fantastic. Get some.

review/summary: Delicious, can be made without oil (still yummy!) and VEGAN!
review/text: I love the versatility of this product. I keep some in my office and have it at home a lot, as well. All you need is a measuring cup, microwave-friendly glass covered container, and you're good to go! It is the basis for many a quick and easy meal. I often have it with vegetables and soups (try the Dr. McDougall soups, also on Amazon, for quick and easy healthy no/low fat meals on the go.) Thanks for offering this in bulk, too!

review/summary: Best Tea on Earth (No, I don't own company stock!)
review/text: Everyone in my house is addicted to this tea. We drink it iced. Make one or two pitchers of it a day. It's not sweetened, but has a subtle, natural sweetness to it. Feels refreshing and clean. It was also one of the few things I tolerated well when I was pregnant and routinely nauseated. I've heard this from other mothers too. Love it.

review/summary: A delicious 'tonic-like' tea
review/text: I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine.

review/text: The candy pictured is Vanilla Caramel, but what is being sold is plain caramel, coming in a dark brown wrapper - a completely different product. I will note that when contacted they sent me the candy that is pictured.
