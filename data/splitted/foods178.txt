review/summary: Great product for the money
review/text: If you've never tried Socca/Farinata, a Mediterranean street food, buy some chickpea flour like this and whip some up - there's a recipe on the package.  I made several different things with this product.  I used recipes by NEW YORK TIMES food writer, Mark Bittman. You can find him online.  Be sure to try his 'tortillita with shrimp' - amazingly wonderful! There are a host of other recipes for fritters, pancakes, etc. This is also avery healthy product - lots of fiber and no gluten.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZDWMGO">Lucini Italia Traditional Cinque E' Cinque, 250-Gram Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: my absolute favorite cookies
review/text: I am Canadian and live in the States and these cookies were a staple in our house as my father was Scottish. I could never find shortbread cookies (Walkers) down here in the store except at Christmas time. When I found them on the Amazon website I bought 6 boxes and I am not sharing them with anyone. They are so good and they are mine all mine.

review/summary: Walker's Shortbread is too good
review/text: I first got acquainted with Walkers Shortbread during my first travels to England about 40 years ago.  They were addictive then and even better now.  Unfortunately, they are really too good and the temptation to eat more than one is a battle I have to fight every day.  If you have never had the chance to eat Walkers Shortbread, now is the time to start.

review/summary: Perfect with tea, coffee, milk, port or scotch whiskey
review/text: Today is 12/2/11.  My order of Walkers Shortbread Assorted, 8.8-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6) arrived yesterday and the BEST BEFORE date is END MAR 2013.  Perfect!  Plenty of time to share and consume these delectable treats from Scotland, the producer of my favorite whiskeys.  Although the Amazon description states that this package includes, "Shortbread in five distinct shapes," the cookies are actually in three shapes.  Included in each box are 4 rounds, 6 triangles, and 8 of the traditional fingers, totaling 18 cookies.  They are fresh, golden, attractive to the eye and satisfying to the tastebuds.  It's quite interesting that the boxes list the ingredients in many languages, but English is not included.  They are made of wheat flour, butter (33%), sugar and salt.  Walkers shortbread makes a gift that would likely be appreciated by any person who enjoys buttery confections that are slightly sweet who is not allergic to milk, wheat, gluten or nuts, is not vegan and has either teeth or rigid gums for chewing.  The biscuits which are about 1/2 inch thick soften when wet, so a full set of teeth is not required.<br /><br />When in a crunch for entertaining purposes, I've dipped the shortbread halfway into microwave melted bittersweet chocolate and then into chopped toasted pecans.  There's no need to limit yourself to a plain shortbread when you can create a desert worthy of oohs and aahs in a matter of minutes.  We love Walkers shortbread and are pleased to have purchased them from Amazon in a box of 6 packages.

review/summary: My FAVORITE shortbread cookies ...
review/text: These are almost too good: buttery, not *too* sweet, perfect with almost any beverage.  Like another reviewer, I often "fancy these up" by dipping in melted semisweet chocolate and dusting with chopped nuts (pecans, hazelnuts, etc.) or crushed Heath bars.  I've made shortbread myself, but why go to the trouble when I can get excellent ready-made?  Really exceptional stuff ...

I later realised that the price was not that great (at 24 per 6 packs, it came to about  dollars a box) - there was a 2 for 5 dollars deal at my local Sprouts around Christmas. However, since I don't buy these often and the ordering is more convenient than shopping around, I did not feel bad about paying a bit more.

review/summary: Highland Heaven!
review/text: These shortbread biscuits by Walkers of Scotland are some of the finest I've ever encountered. Their adherence to a time-honored recipe, with pure, traditional, and preservative-free ingredients, likely explains the superb quality of their baked goods. These cookies have a nice, fresh, buttery taste, a slightly crumbly consistency [as expected], and a delightful aroma. Be forewarned, however, these things are highly addictive! Our little Sheltie girl [coincidentally, also from the Scottish Highlands] will willingly attest to this fact...she's crazy for them! The devilish truth is, that these biscuits come in at seventy calories and four saturated fat grams apiece...hence, the reluctant 4-star rating.

review/summary: I really wanted it to work...
review/text: So I had a big problem this season with rabbits eating my Hostas,lilies and other plants. It was getting so bad, that I figured I'd spend the money and try one of these sprays knowing that the reviews for pretty much all of them seem to be split.  I figured I had nothing to lose.  So I applied as per the labels instructions.  I did not have any issue with the spray damaging any of my flowers or plants and it did seem to work initially.  I had almost a week with no new damage. There was also no rain of any note that may have washed it away.  I don't think the rain since has washed it away either though, as I can see a residue on some of the leaves on some plants that were sprayed and left high up in a place where rabbits couldn't get to them.  Unfortunately, the happiness was short-lived. Again I was coming home to check on my plants and finding more bitten off leaves and decapitated lilies. I stopped checking before leaving for work because it would put me in such a bad mood every time I'd see more "victims".<br /> I just hate spending almost $20.00 for something (I was so desperate that I paid the extra 3.99 for 1 day even though I am a prime member) that in the end did not work as it should have. I just planted replacement bulbs for the 22 of 25 lilies that were beheaded and now I am here looking for a different kind of rabbit/small animal repellent. It's difficult to choose, as again it seems many products work for some and not for others. It looks like I was just one of the unlucky ones with this product and I'll try something else and see what happens.  Good luck to you all.  I hope you have more success than I did whether you try this product or a different one.

review/text: The pieces of grits are much larger than average sized grits, but the flavor is better, as these are true yellow corn grits, and not bleached out hominy grits. I have since trying this brand purchased some regular sized non-bleached organic yellow corn grits and like them much better. Also, this brand is quite expensive, even considering that you get the reuseable baggy, when compared to the price of the finer ground organic grits I purchased elsewhere, which only cost $1.79/lb. as opposed to the price of these grits and getting less than a pound.

However, I began to wonder if he had a sensitivity to beef and chicken, as well as high percentages of protein...<br /><br />Within one meal of eating this product, his stools were improved. Within two meals, I could pick up his stools, rather than wipe them off the ground. I never thought I would be so happy to pick up poop!<br /><br />I definitely recommend for anyone who thinks their dog may have a food allergy.

For the record i'm a very picky eater.<br /><br />The reason why i say $20 is because the can says cat food. If someone added some chicken broth and threw it in a bowl with some egg noodles, i will drink it all up thinking its regular chicken noodle soup. It seriously looks yummy. There's chunks of veggies in there, which my cat surprisingly eats most of. When i was feeding him steak frites by Weruva, there would be a pile of just the veggies left behind when he was done. The peas are a bit hard, so that's the only thing he refused to eat in the can. If you take the time to squish it and get rid of the skin, it seems to make it more edible for him. but i really don't have time to do that for him.

I tried this and all three of my cats gobbled it up...in fact one was snorting while eating it. Even the picky little one loved it. The first ingredient is boneless white chicken, which is what my vet says to look for. Lots of vitamins including taurine which cats need. It has little bits of veggies and I thought they would just leave that in the dish, but they all ate that too. In fact it looks good enough for me to eat. I'm still trying other flavors, I've tried this and chicken with veggies and brown rice. They liked that one also. I also like how I can order straight from Amazon and not have to make a special trip to the out of the way Pet food store.

There is no second guessing, it doesn't even look like cat food. Love it!!<br /><br />*Update: I have 4 cats and I have noticed that after switching to Fussie Cat food their fur seems to have lost the natural oils which give them the 'shiny' healthy look. I looked this up and it could be from poor nutrition. I'm a bit disappointed.<br /><br />I found that adding some Omega 3 drops to their food helps. I tried switching but they really like their Fussie food. :P

review/summary: DO NOT feed your cat Fussie Cat foods!!!
review/text: My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done.

I sometimes will sprinkle it on salads as well.<br /><br />Because I use this as a table spice as well as for cooking I have found the perfect table shakers for sumac (and cumin - another spice I sprinkle on many foods): <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007T40P28">NEW, 6 oz. (Ounce) Swirl Glass Cheese Shaker, Pepper Spice Shaker w/ Perforated Stainless Steel Lid - Set of 2</a>.<br /><br />If you are reading this review you are probably looking for a source of high quality sumac - this is it.

review/summary: A bit disappointed
review/text: I'm always looking for new flavors for my cooking. Supposedly, sumac gives a lemon flavor. I tried using it in rice and with fish, but I can't tell that it's even there. I'm not even sure if it is supposed to be cooked. Maybe it should be just sprinkled on after cooking. I've used it in tandem with preserved lemons, but I think it was the lemons that gave the dish such a strong lemon flavor.

review/summary: Missing Trader Joes Crepes Discovered!!!!
review/text: I was crushed that my fav store discontinued my fav crepes (& the *only* mix I ever liked!).<br /><br />I called Trader Joes Customer Service, they were a brick wall ("Confidential" who the real manufacturer of their crepes were)...My French friend had a brilliant idea to google the ingredients which lead me to this discovery! It also appears others are catching on b/c the Kungsornen crepe mix is sold out all over the web...<br /><br />The boxes from Amazon taste slightly 'barkier" (hard to describe but I am a huge food snob), but it's the exact same ingredients so I'll live with it (ie, wheat flour, no sugar!).<br /><br />Pass the word out there, & if anyone else is as fanatical about this mix as I am, please help me petition Trader Joes to carry it once again! :)

review/text: I was looking forward to this mix remembering wonderful Swedish pancakes we used to have in VA. Unfortunately, this mix didn't produce anything close to that - they turned out to be a tasteless version of French crepes. The pancakes also had a vague smell of fish. Considering that now I am stuck with 6 boxes, I am quite disappointed.

review/text: I grew up in a house where as kids we would beg my mother to make Swedish pancakes from scratch (which is alot of work) so we didn't get them that often. I was out driving around the back country roads in Ma and came across this authentic country store. While I was browsing, I found this Swedish pancake mix and said, "what the heck, I'll give it a try"...Well, I'm here to tell you that is tastes as close to homemade as it gets! Now in searching for it, I find it on Amazon.com. Awesome...so ordering I am! and recommending you try it too. I'm telling you, you can't go wrong if you're looking for authentic taste!!

review/summary: Dinner for Every Month
review/text: I got this Dinner of the Month Club pasta meal as a gift from a very special person back in CT where I used to live--I believe they are one of the leading gourmet presents companies nationwide.<br />The pasta is ready literally within 15 minutes--a quick meal is a good thing, especially for a single guy like me who doesn't have the time of day to cook complicated stuff--and not only that, it tastes excellent! (I added some parmesan cheese to the sauces that I got in my fridge and it made it even better). Honestly I wasn't expecting it to taste this good. As an Italian food fan, I was pretty satisfied with this gift. If you don't want to leave the house or what to stay home to watch the game, it's a perfect gift. Do I recommend their food and services? Absolutely! Giving gifts like these are a good idea for single people like me, so I am thinking returning the favor and sending these to some people I know for the upcoming holidays.

review/text: I recently joined the dinner of the month club and I am so glad I did! It may be the best gift I've ever given myself:) My entire family reaps the benefits because it is a treat for everyone, no matter age or gender. We always look forward to the arrival of a new and exciting pasta in the mail every month. We even have a tradition now in our house that we all cook dinner together on "pasta night" and enjoy a savory dish provided by the dinner club.<br />It is so easy to make an impressive dinner with dinner club because they even send recipes to go along with their noodles and sauces! I recently received the Vegan Pumpkin pasta fettuccine paired with the Butternut Squash with Parmesan Cheese. I also got the Italian Spice Linguini with the Organic Roasted Garlic sauce. Even just boiling the noodles warms your home with a delicious fragrance. Everything I have ever received from Flying Noodle has always been of the highest quality. I have friends over to play dominoes every Tuesday night and I always brag about my Flying Noodle packages. They have tried most of my dishes and always want to know where they can get the noodles and sauces at our local grocery store. There is just nothing like it that you can buy from the store, I have since gotten all of my domino friends on Flying Noodle- dinner of the month club.<br />I definitely know where to go to do my Christmas shopping this year! There is something for everyone and I know I can trust Flying Noodle to deliver the best quality of products to my loved ones.

review/text: My main use for almond, soy, or rice milk is to use in coffee or tea.  The best so far is Silk soymilk original but this Silk almond milk is very nearly as good.  Actually as far as taste goes I'd say the almond milk might be best but for using in coffee the soy edges out the almond for creaminess.  I totally enjoy them both and have been buying the almond milk from Amazon at a very fair price.  But now it's off the Subscribe and Save program so the cost will go up .  I intend to continue buying either Silk almond or Silk soy milk because they are the best for me.

review/summary: Good product and good value
review/text: Please be aware that these are 6 32 oz (1 quart) packages and not half gallons as you may believe. The good thing about this is the shelf life of the packages. A normal half gallon is good for about as long as a regular milk product. These are good for months until you open them and then they are good for 10 to 14 days.  I use them to make a protein shake with fresh bananas that I have frozen. I use a non-dairy protein powder and it all tastes great.  Once I open the carton, I date it with the opening date so I can track it. That aside, it is a good product with a good taste, but not so good with cereal that gets soggy, like Raisin Bran.  It is not bad, just not the same as with 2% milk. I did not think I would like it, but, for health reasons I made the change and it is a good one.

review/text: I use this from just ordinary drinking to mixing in my steelcut oatmeal. It's delicious and tastes similar to soymilk with a nutty hint. I'm a fan of the taste of soymilk anyways, so I naturally liked this stuff, but I stopped drinking soymilk a while back; for the men out there though soy milk increases estrogen (allegedly) and I'd rather not take that risk. For those who don't like soymilk, I would not recommend this product as it is very similar in taste. Keeps well enough but I went through the entire case in less than a month (once opened each box lasts around a week).

review/text: I am constantly trying new foods, and when I read about the nutritious value of almondmilk, I decided to get a two-pack. About two weeks later, I opened my first one and gagged when I added it to my cereal. The taste was just unbearable, and for once, I found my vocabulary lacking in adjectives to describe it's taste. I checked the expiration date, which wasn't for another 8 months, and left it onto my refrigerator. Perhaps I purchased a bad batch, because the other one started bloating just sitting on my counter (I purchased the shelf-life ones and refrigerated them after opening).<br /><br />The only way I can tolerate the taste is to put some protein powder in it and mix it with some agave syrup. I've eaten a lot of MRE's in my time in the Army, and this easily ranks below any nasty thing I've eaten (or drank). I'll stick with my regular 2% milk and continue with a vitamin supplement for nutrition.

review/summary: They don't taste like peanut butter at all
review/text: I'm going to be honest here, I was intrigued by the marketing, packaging and general assumption that this treat would at least somewhat taste like peanut butter, after all, I only give my dog the best. I consider myself a first line of defense of sorts for my dog. After purchasing this product, I was sitting in my car and my curiosity got the better of me. I tried one. It didn't taste bad, but it definitely didn't taste like peanut butter AT ALL. Zero peanut butter taste. How does a company get away with such blatant false advertisement like this. It's shocking, shocking I say.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, there is no peanut butter flavor at all. Why say it when it's not true?<br /><br />Dog still loves them though. But then again, the only thing he doesn't like is olives.

Personally I thought it still too coarse to be called a "powder". But so far I still haven't found any other company that holds this product around here so if I am ever in need of Almond Powder again I'd probably go back to this company for more.

review/summary: Best Pre-Gym Smoothie Ingredient Ever
review/text: My doctor recommended the normal 5-hour energy several years ago when I was having mid day slumps and required naps. It worked great while I needed it. Now I have switched to this. I add it to a smoothies about half an hour before I hit the gym and my workouts are great, I have tremendous stamina and do interval treadmill training with no problem, even if it's been a long day.<br /><br />The great thing about it is that you don't really know it's working. After I finish at the gym I realize how much energy i had, but when I am actually doing the routines I don't really notice the energy, it simply happens.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone, particularly if you don't like, want and can't ingest caffeine.<br /><br />One caution, it has a citrus flavor that, even in a smoothie with mixed berry yogurt, cranberry juice, banana and mixed frozen berries comes through. It's a good taste, unless you don't like citrus.

review/summary: One of my favorite fats
review/text: Given that we are living in a time when (at least in the US) we are told that fats in our diets are bad for us, it is a real pleasure to find an item like this.  I have long been a fan of animal fats when used in moderation (O-K, not always in moderation, I did makes some duck-fat french fries not too long ago, INCREDIBLE!).  Yes, many people eat way too much fat, but more importantly they often eat the wrong ones.  Certain hydrogenated fats not only have dubious effects on our health they just don't add as much flavor as traditional fats such as butter, olive oil, chicken fat and, yes duck fat.<br /><br />I try to watch both my calorie and fat intake but I do so by eating less and choosing my fats for flavor.  Duck fat gives ordinary dishes like spinach or mashed potatoes more taste and complexity that would butter or, God forbid, margarine.  The French have known this for centuries and use duck fat to add flavor and depth to a wide variety of foods.<br /><br />I sometimes buy my duck fat in larger tubs, 10-16 oz., but I like these little 1.5 oz. containers.  They stay fresh on the shelf when unopened and then I use the entire thing, not needing to worry about finding room for it in my overly-stocked refrigerator.  The cost per ounce is not to bad when buying it in these little cups, about the same as some of the larger tubs. The only thing that I don't like is the the oils and fat solids tend to separate.  Not a big deal if I am mixing it into a dish or browning something with it, but if I want to use it as a spread (highly recommended) I have to stick it in the fridge first and then stir it up.  Other than that I must say that this is a staple for me and a great addition to any pantry (when used reasonably, of course).

review/text: SOYBEANS?!<br /><br />The whole attraction to cooking with duck fat (besides the flavor) is that it's a natural, healthy animal fat. Why on earth does this product need to contain soybeans (processed, not healthy)? Oh that's right, because the government subsidizes soybean farms and so soybean products must now appear in everything Americans eat. Reprehensible.

review/text: Each of these six units in this package of rendered duck fat are small, but a little goes a long way. They are convenient because one package is enough to flavor anything you want to use it for without digging repeatedly into a tub and having to measure. The fat itself is delicious. I have used to to flavor home fries, roasted vegetables,  and smeared it on homemade bread and it is fantastic. It may seem pricey, but duck fat in general is pricey and for the packaging and doorstep delivery convenience, it is a good buy.

review/text: Duck fat is awesome!  Makes really flavorful way to cook just about anything...fry eggs in it, coat vegetables and roast (brussels sprouts are divine) or just spread on toast.<br /><br />I will say though that what you get in these little cups is pretty much identical to what you get if you collect the fat from a roasted duck...but good if you use the fat a lot more often than you roast ducks (I do save fat but honestly...the grocery store only gets ducks so often).<br /><br />This seems good quality...has all the flavor, strained so you get only the fat (no "jelly", duck bits, or other rendering byproducts)<br /><br />Turns solid in the fridge, liquid in the cups.  Refrigerate after opening...can use about 2-4 times per cup depending on what you're doing with it.

review/text: I've never had duck fat before, so I don't know how it compares to other brands. In comparison to other oils though, it is supreme. I find it adds a savory touch to class up your meals. If you're not sure how to cook with it Google duck fat and you will find plenty of recipes. The portions in the six pack are perfect if you are cooking for one or two. Finally the price is excellent for this product esp. with the Subscribe and Save program. The only complaint I have is that Amazon runs out of this product all the time. An amazing product at an amazing price!

The shipping was quick, I was able to track it and time the rest of my cooking, and just as I was worried about I couldnt quite render enough on my own, which made the 1.5 oz size useful, I used a container just to top off what I needed and didnt have to cut my confit with a different fat.<br />So, quick, well tracked, and the right size.

review/text: Okay. I'm a very accomplished home cook of some sophistication, but I'd never used duck fat. I wondered about the small size units, but I find that cooking for usually uses one or half of one unit, and the other half can be used plenty soon enough that it's not wasted. The taste is distinct and quite good. My first use was with some braised pork. I had made enough for two nights, and the product arrived for the second night. I sauteed the pork and carrots in half a unit of duck fat to reheat. The rich flavor much improved a dish that is anyway always better the second night. Half a unit was plenty. The richness was a very good addition to the pork and carrots that had been braised without wine and therefore somewhat plain. I see this as being something I keep in the pantry.

I keep these with me on days that I can't prepare a meal or when I am tired of my diet food and want something that has a little more hearty flavor. Caveat is: just like turkey-jerky, if you didn't know you were eating ostrich you might think that it tastes a bit different. Keep in mind that ostrich tastes more like chicken than beef.<br /><br />The Good:<br />Compact (will fit in cargo pocket)<br />Tasty<br />Fairly low salt<br />Semi-Moist (good or bad depending on your taste)<br />80 calories<br />Great for diets<br /><br />The Bad:<br />Hard to open sometimes<br />A bit large to fit in pocket (won't fit in standard pants pocket)<br />Co-workers think you are weird to eat Ostrich<br />A little expensive<br /><br />So, with all that said, I keep a box of these in my cupboard at all times just in case I need a snack and I don't want to go off-diet. Buy a box and see what you think.

review/summary: Has Sucralose!!!
review/text: This is suppose to be a "healthy" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients.

review/summary: The JERKY GODS are happy!
review/text: The jerky GODS sat high atop Mt. Olympus and pondered how they could make a delicious jerky that combines both beast and foul.  The solution was OSTRIM and the result is amazing!  This high protein, low fat tasty stick of goodness is the perfect snack on the go.  I pack this in my kids lunch boxes, in my workout bag and in my bedside drawer for a late night snack (kidding- but I totally could!)!  If you havent tried this yet- do it!

review/text: Delivery was on time but when I opened the product it was like the shelf life expired.  They were hard and chewy. I contacted the manufactur and they sent out a new box. I will be ordering direct from now on.
