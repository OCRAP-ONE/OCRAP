review/summary: Delicious, gentle flavor
review/text: The tea comes in three nice tins, which individually make nice gifts for tea-loving friends. However, the tea itself is the real treat. Presented beautifully in silken bags, the mixture is a combination of the green tea, brown rice and roasted corn. The flavors are smooth and subtle. I have ordered genmaicha from China and this is better than other brands. It is a real delight to have a cup of this tea.

review/text: This Genmaicha is much better than you can buy so easily on the store shelf from Yamamotoyama. Mild and tasty alternative to regular green tea. Good nose. I first lived in Japan 40 years ago. Was surprised to find this from Coffee Bean at Ralph's.  Amazon price much better.

review/text: I bought this because of the reviews here and while it wasn't bad I would say it was just ok. I'm one of those people who like my tea a little stronger and this brand is pretty weak so I would say that was my biggest issue with it. All in all, as far as bagged tea goes this Genmaicha is great for anyone who likes a very mild flavor but for me I'll stick with Yamamotoyama (it's stronger and cheaper too!).

review/text: I suppose more people on Amazon haven't discovered this because it's not available (yet) with Prime shipment. It's worth paying shipping just to get it, so I order multiple boxes at a time to cut the cost (and Swanson is a good company that I order other things from, sometimes). I stated my reasons in the heading. I do wish I could get it in my Prime orders, though. The other brands of stevia taste way too sweet to me (and I use only half a packet of this), and all I've tried but this one have a subtle but objectionable odd taste. This one is just right, to me.

review/text: I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that "truffle oil" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of "truffle oil" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called "Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles." Read it and weep: http://bit.ly/2MRmyQ<br /><br />And if you see "truffle oil" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes...

review/text: At a local restaurant, they serve truffle butter. I loved it so much that I was curious to experiment with truffle flavors at home. I had read a lot of reviews on the butter being melted or settled by the time it arrived so decided to purchased the Urbani truffle oil to make my own. The package was delivered earlier than the expected delivery date. The bottle was much smaller than I had expected, but after reading recipes, you don't really use that much to get the flavor. I have made truffle mashed potatoes and truffle butter. As a novice chef, I am pleased with my purchase.

review/summary: Use in place of  garlic oil...
review/text: Truffles remind me of garlic with an added dimension of aromatic appeal. In fact, I'm convinced that you can use truffle oil in many recipes that are compatible with garlic oil. While black truffles are highly prized, you may prefer the white truffle oil in a rice recipe.<br /><br />"Risotto with Red Bell Peppers and Truffle Oil" is a good example of a recipe using truffle oil. I actually created this recipe using the URBANI truffle oil and it is superior in flavor!<br /><br />The chicken base gives excellent flavor and is less salty than most bouillon cubes which are less flavorful.<br /><br />1 T. Urbani "white" truffle oil<br /><br />1 T. salted butter<br /><br />1 chicken liver, chopped, this is optional<br /><br />1 T. chopped yellow onion<br /><br />1 T. chopped fresh parsley<br /><br />1/4 c. chopped celery stalks<br /><br />1/4 c. chopped red bell pepper<br /><br />1/4 tsp. ground black pepper<br /><br />1 tsp. garlic salt<br /><br />1 c. uncooked Arborio rice<br /><br />1 T. chicken base<br /><br />4 c. boiling water<br /><br />Heat the oil (some have told me to add it later, but I don't think it makes much of a difference in this recipe) and butter in a 6-quart Dutch oven over medium heat. Fry chicken livers, then add onion, parsley, celery and bell pepper. Cook 5 minutes. Add pepper, garlic salt and rice. Stir until rice absorbs the butter and looks transparent on both ends of the grain. This actually takes 2 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup of the water with chicken base. Stir until most of the water is absorbed. Continue to add water in 1/2 cup additions for the next 30 minutes. This dish must be continually stirred and is completely done when water is almost completely absorbed and there is a creamy sauce coating the rice. Serve immediately or the creamy sauce will be absorbed into the rice and you will have a drier, but still delicious, dish.<br /><br />Makes 6 servings.<br /><br />Recipe Note: This creamy dish is perfect as an accompaniment to Roast Chicken. Red bell pepper has a dramatic effect on any dish it touches, any remaining bell pepper may be chopped and frozen to be used later for decorating a cream soup.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Do not use this in your cooking
review/text: I used to use white truffle oil in my cooking a lot. I had it on a dish at French Laundry and figured it was a great way to up my game and make myself a "fancy chef."  That was before I figured out how to actually cook.  For some background: truffle oil is not an oil made from truffles. There are no truffles in it.  It is olive oil combined with 2,4-dithiapentane, which gives the oil a truffle aroma.  Although 2,4-dithiapentane is not a chemical and is organic, it's still not truffle.  If you see a dish in in a restaurant that uses truffle oil, it is usually because the chef is trying to jump on the "truffle craze" without resorting to the expense of using actual truffles.<br /><br />That being said, I won't lambast the product completely. You can make a successful dish with it if you know what you're doing and use it sparingly (better to cook with it than to use it in the raw form as a dressing to anything).  I've had several truffle oils and Urbani's is one of the worst, because of how pungent it is. The truffle smell is overpowering, and I don't believe they use a good olive oil base, because the stuff goes bad after a couple months.<br /><br />My advice is to stay away from all white truffle oil, but if you have to use it, try to find a better brand than this.

review/summary: Great Dog Food
review/text: We have a new dog in the house and I tried to figure out what a "good" dog food would be. After researching a number of articles on dog food, I came to several conclusions. first, keep away from the supermarket brands. Second, keep away from the heavily advertised brands. Why? Most of these brands feature a great deal of filler and less protein. Chicken Soup for the Dog lovers Soul received consistently high ratings from most independent sources. When you look at the ingredients list, you understand why. This food is loaded with protein and vegetables and has minimal,if any fillers. The first five ingredients are: Chicken, turkey, chicken meal, ocean fish meal, cracked pearled barley. Compare that to the supermarket brands.<br /><br />However, no matter how good i think it is, the real test is MacDuff, who has a very discerning taste. We tried it - he loves it! What more can you ask? We now have a happy and healthy pooch. The price at Amazon for the large bag is very attractive

review/summary: Hottest treat for your dog
review/text: If you like spoiling your dog, try these treats. They are nice and soft, so if you have a little dog with tiny teeth, he will still be able to eat them. And will he eat them!<br /><br />My Shih Tzu, Buzz, is not really picky about his treats and will eat most anything (especially people food), so I didn't expect he'd turn his nose up at these treats. What I DIDN'T expect was that he'd go absolutely bonkers for them. Buzz likes these suckers so much that when I now approach the treat jar, he starts SHAKING in anticipation. Goofy little guy. Maybe they have drugs in them or something, because he cannot get enough. I expect your dog will like them, too.<br /><br />I like them as well . . . they are shaped like little gingerbread men, with a hand (such as it is) raised in a wave, and a smile on his face. Just looking at them makes me smile. They smell great, too, though I wouldn't recommend chowing down on them yourself. Of course, to each her own.<br /><br />The same cute "buddy" shape can be found in the same maker's hard treats, and apparently they're good enough that Buzz, who normally ignores hard treats because they hurt his teeth, will live with the pain in order to scarf them down, too.<br /><br />There's one major downside, though: the price. You save by buying in bulk here, but they're still pricey. And if you buy them at the pet or health food store, they will be even more, sometimes up to $8 a bag. But if you want a special-special treat for your dog, or if you want to reward him once in a while with something extra-yummy, this is the thing. Just get ready for your dog to be a Buddy Biscuit Junky. If you win the lottery, that shouldn't be a problem.

review/summary: Great high value treat!
review/text: My dog does unbelievable things for a Buddy Biscuit! They're soft, easy to eat (no grazing for crumbs), easy to break into tiny pieces (don't want your dog to get fat because of training!), and reasonably priced. I couldn't be happier with them.

review/summary: There's little my pup won't do for these!
review/text: My three month old beagle puppy LOVES these. My only gripe, which isn't specific to the brand but doggie treats in general, is that they are rather large for a pup (for training and repetitive awards, not in general). I cut these little ginger bread shaped treats into about 8-10 pieces for training.

review/summary: Dogs Go Mad for Grilled Beef Treats!
review/text: I am a pet sitter, and I have been carrying Cloud Star Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits for a couple years now.  The treats are soft and can be easily broken up for smaller dogs.  They also can be crumbled over food for the dog who needs a little extra motivation to clean out his food bowl. I am not sure if they still refer to this flavor as "Grilled Beef Madness," but dogs still go mad (in a good way) when I pull out these treats!  These treats are a hit with all of my four-legged clients, and I always carry a bag with me when I am doing my rounds.  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Great Mid-Value Treat for Your Dog!
review/text: I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.<br /><br />Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.<br /><br />I note these as a "mid-value" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.<br /><br />They are not "mid-value" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them.

review/text: These are my dogs favorite treats right now.  I have a 12 year old lab and she does not like hard treats, so these are perfect for her because they are soft and chewy just like the package says.  My Chihuahua devours them too.  They are made in the USA and the ingredients are: beef, unbleached wheat flour, tapioca starch, maple syrup, glycerin, gelatin, natural flavor, salt, natural smoke flavor, phosphoric acid, sorbic acid (as preservatives), mixed tocopherols (natural preservative).  So no corn, soy, artificial colors or flavors or byproducts.<br />You can also save up your proof of purchase on each bag and then use those to get free stuff from their website.

Now I'm just glad (sort of) that I'm near the end of the case, because the darned things are addictive! Nice crisp crunch to them, they actually have detectable salt flavor (unlike the sesame pretzels, which I have to add salt--pretzels gotta have a little salt). I  think they're better than plain old wheat pretzels, to the extent that I remember what those taste like.<br /><br />another tasty snack to add to the GF arsenal of munchies!

To us they taste nothing like "real" pretzels, and are definitely not worth the calories, fat, or price. I know that this is because they lack the gluten, but they aren't very crunchy, more like crisp, since they aren't dense at all. They also have a funky, sort of metallic aftertaste.

review/text: The cost on these has gone up since I first bought them some 12 years ago. Despite the cost, they are a good deal for anyone who can't eat wheat or gluten.  They taste delicious, and as several others have noted, are just as good, if not better than regular pretzels.  It's hard for me to find these even in the Twin Cities, so I will very happily be buying them through Amazon.  I have tried and used many Ener-G brand products over the years.  These are among the best.  I find their breads dry, tasteless, and unappealing in the extreme, but the pretzels  are awesome.  Other brands have an off taste, but not these.  They are wonderful and I will buy them frequently. Even my gluten eating family enjoys these, so I hide them!  They can eat their own.

review/summary: GREAT gluten free "normal tasting" pretzels!
review/text: These pretzels take just like "normal" wheat pretzels.  They are crisp and just the right amount of salt.  Would like them more if they were organic and less expensive.

review/text: These are great as a healthy snack. I find them quite tasty, but I do not like the ones without the sesame seeds! Easy to throw in a lunchbox and better than 99% (if not 100%) of what's in most vending machines when you want (need?) something a little salty and gluten free.

review/summary: Satisfying gf product
review/text: I have enjoyed these pretzels many times. They are also popular with my gluten-eating family members. The only reason I'd rate these pretzels with four stars is due to the somewhat high fat content, most likely due the the second ingredient listed being palm oil. However, the low protein in these pretzels is a positive for those diagnosed with chronic kidney conditions.<br /><br />I will order again!

review/summary: Perfect Snack
review/text: I just love these pretzels. They are a great snack from the ordinary gluten-free diet. I was a counselor at camp this summer and one of the kids wanted to try what I was eating. I told her she may not like it; it was my special food. The next day she came back to me and said, "Where's your pretzels? I want more! Can you go buy me some? I will give you some of my allowance if I can have more of them!" So needless to say they are a big hit with all age groups. And don't forget you can dip them in peanut butter for a special treat. Enjoy!

review/summary: Better than Regular Pretzels
review/text: I have to agree with the rest.  These pretzels are so good that people that don't have to be on a gluten free diet love them.  Both the taste and the texture are fabulous.  It's a bit difficult to describe why they are better.  You almost have to try them to see what people are speaking about.  Part of it, I think, is that they have a crunch just like regular pretzels, but not quite as hard.  And they seem to have almost a buttery taste to them.  But, I have to agree with a previous reviewer, this is probably one of Ener-G's better products as I have been disappointed in others.

On the way home, she ate almost an entire bag and then for the next three days, all I heard at meal time was "I want my pretzels!"  She's down to 0.25 bag per day now!

review/text: These pretzels are really good. They taste just like regular wheat pretzels. I think even people who are not eating GF would not know these pretzels were not "normal" pretzels. The pretzels are crisp, not too salty, with just a hint of buttery richness. However, like most GF foods they add extra fat to make up for the loss of the wheat and gluten. You should know that each 20 oz bag has 350 calories and 18 grams of fat. Snack accordingly.

review/text: This product is delicious!  Zillions of seame seeds cover this great gluten-free product.  The only thing lacking is the taste of salt on these pretzels.  They are a wonderful addition to homemade Chex Mix though.  I make it without Wheat Chex.  Divine combo.  The gluten-free Chex Mix is a wonderful treat once in a while.  I eat the regular Ener-G Foods pretzels with a fresh apple every day.

review/text: I have really enjoyed these pretzels! I have Celiac Disease so I must avoid wheat products. Pretzels are one of my favorite salty snacks and I had to give them up until I learned about the Glutino pretzels. I am excited that the pretzels are now sold in some regular grocery stores, not just in the health food stores. But, the most economical buy is to purchase them in bulk...it really saves you $$$. Thanks to Glutino for this fine product and I am looking forward to trying your other products. I did try the apple-cinnamon cereal and enjoyed it as a snack. Keep up the good work!!

Its not sweet, and  cooked well with the cream sauce and wilted spinach. In fact, I liked it so much I purchased 6 more packs.<br /><br />It comes in a large 10 lb size as well which Amazon.com sells.

review/summary: Great palm but a few dislikes
review/text: Pros: good for desk/countertop in kitchen/window-ceal etc. The pot is good-looking for a modern home...<br /><br />Cons: The plant is smaller than expected and the saga palm is actually a Cycad sago palm which is extremely poisonous to animals (including humans) if ingested. Also the pot does not have holes in the bottom so it is hard to water the plant without flooding it and having all the little rocks overflow out. Also if it is not properly watered it will get a yellow tint on the leaves showing a sign of lack of nutrition.

review/text: Plant arrived very well packed and looking nice and green.  Pot is solid, a bit small however.  I'm guessing this palm can grow another year or so in this pot, then it will need a transplant.  I will say the picture they used is a bit misleading as the plant I received only has two shoots and is not nearly as bushy as the picture.

review/summary: This is the base for my "homemade" chai tea...excellent!
review/text: I do not drink this on its own. I steep it with a bag of Tea India Cardamom Chai, a Star Anise, the seeds of two cardamom pods and a chunk of candied or regular ginger, I also grind in a twist of black pepper. After it is done, I add honey to taste and milk or half & half.<br /><br />I've had this tea alone and it misses something (in my taste preferences) and the pepper taste is strong in an unpleasant way. It mellows out if I add milk or cream. But since I prefer stronger flavors in my Chai, I add all of the above. The milk is crucial because without it the tea will be bitter.<br /><br />Even though I'm not crazy about this alone, I can't do without it when making my own Chai.

review/summary: Best chai available in a general grocery store!
review/text: I have tried all the brands of chai sold in my local grocery stores, and I always come back to this one. I like the spiciness of the black pepper especially - this tea will warm you up! I am very picky about black teas in general, and will mostly only drink loose leaf black tea or PG Tips, but this one tastes high quality to me and gives me something to drink that's a little sweeter and complex when I'm in the mood for something beyond black tea. Brew it in just-boiled water, add honey and milk or cream to taste, and enjoy!<br /><br />The biggest down side to Tazo brand chai is that it tends to be rather pricey compared to other brands. I try to buy it in bulk when I can to ease the sting of the price a bit.

review/summary: Excellent Balsamic! Well Worth the Money
review/text: Like most Americans, I'm used to the same balsamic taste that remains pretty much the same across all major grocery store brands. This is not that at all. An incredibly intense flavor, this balsamic is a thick, sweet syrup to be used sparingly. It's great drizzled over salad! I bought mine in Florence at 20 euros, so this is a bit more expensive for the exact same thing, but even with this, I highly recommend if you love great tasting balsamic.
