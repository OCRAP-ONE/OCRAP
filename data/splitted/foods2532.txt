review/text: Not what I expected.  Not bad, just not as good as I thought it would be.  Sweetness is a personal thing, I found the product a little shy in that area.  Which is funny really, because I usually find foods too sweet for my taste.

review/summary: Ridiculously delicious!
review/text: Let me just say, this peanut butter is amazing.  It has an awesome peanut butter flavor that, instead of being overpowered by chocolate, is complimented by chocolate.  The texture was somewhat of a surprise for me.  There were tiny (like grains of sand) chunks of peanut in it, which isn't really a bad thing but not what I expected.  It's very easy to spread.  I eat it on fruit for a filling breakfast, but it's delicious enough to eat plain.  In fact, you will probably have to restrain yourself from eating it plain if you want it to last more than a day.  My mouth is watering just from typing the words "eating it plain."  No joke.<br /><br />The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the evaporated cane juice.  They say they do not use sugar, but cane juice is just a fancy word for less-unhealthy sugar.  White sugar loses its color and nutrients during the refinement process, whereas evaporated cane juice does not.

review/summary: Meh, I think I like Justin's better
review/text: I wanted something like Reese's peanut butter cups, but this has neither enough chocolatey flavor nor peanut buttery.  It needs to be both saltier and sweeter.  It's just like a sort of bland peanut butter w/some unsugared cocoa powder thrown in.  The cocoa powder makes it drier and less oiler, which definite decreases the mouth-feel pleasure for me.  Seems like diet peanut butter w/choco added to make people feel less deprived.  I won't throw it out, but I went back and got Justin's Chocolate Hazelnut Butter instead. I know it's like oranges and tangerines - not exactly the same, but I still think Justin's has a better concept for the heft and creaminess needed as well as a better level of salt. The search continues...

review/summary: Spreadable peanut butter cups
review/text: My first taste sent my mind back to that moment where you try a Reese's cup for the first time in a couple years, remembering it as delicious from childhood (or maybe the commercials), and instead think it has a kinda stale taste, chocolate and peanut butter somehow managing to drown each other out into a grainy mush.<br /><br />As I ate more, the cocoa flavor took over, but more as a sharp edge than a "rich" flavor.<br /><br />That said, I bet it *does* go great with bananas, and I mainly got what I was looking for: a compact, high-calorie sweet fix that stores well (got in February 2011; use by date Nov. 2012--well over a year).<br /><br />The texture is light, almost mousse-like, and definitely easily spreadable. I'm thinking pancakes.<br /><br />I'm unsure whether I want to get used to the taste, though: it's got enough chocolate to induce cravings.<br /><br />So, if "spreadable peanut butter cup" sounds good to you, go for it. If you're more used to "real" food, think twice about the perfect reviews.

review/text: This is good peanut butter. Healthy (from the label: no high fructose corn syrup, etc.) and reasonably priced. I must have been spoiled by Nutella! I wasn't expecting it to be Nutella, But I just couldn't taste the chocolate. Probably I could tell the difference in a blind taste test with plain peanut butter. I wonder how my Nutella-crazed grandaughter will like this? Anyway it is good, and reasonably priced for healthy vegan food. I had just hoped for more of a chocolate flavor.<br /><br />Update: Child can't taste the chocolate either, despite the chocolatey appearance. She won't touch this.

review/summary: I ask you, what is the point?
review/text: Seriously.  My wife nabbed this at the store the other day because our girls are in love with Nutella and she thought this might be a nice change of pace for them.  The idea of chocolate peanut butter is not a new one.  Just open your eyes and look at the cookie aisle in any grocery store.  They are lined wall to wall with chocolate peanut butter flavored cookies.  It's like the most popular flavor on the market.  I, honestly, am not always a fan and wish that there was more variety out there, but whatever.  The masses have spoken and `chocolate and peanut butter' are a `thing' that just won't go away anytime soon.  This product though, doesn't utilize that flavor very well.  In fact, all we are left with is peanut butter that is the consistency of melted chocolate.  I don't taste the chocolate at all.  Instead it's like really sticky peanut butter.  I guess the only real taste difference is that it is a cloyingly sweet variation of your standard peanut butter.  I don't like this.  My kids liked it, sure.  It is basically dessert, and if you like peanut butter you won't be offended by this, but I don't see a point to this product at all.

review/summary: best of the bracing English teas
review/text: There are two classes of English tea drinkers, I am told: those who love English Breakfast and those who love Earl Grey.  Usually, one does not care for the other tea.  This tea is one of the best for the English Breakfast lover.  It is strong, bracing, full of character, and (caution) caffeine.  It loses nothing of its pleasing depth with the addition of milk.  I add honey, also.  American English Breakfast teas pale in comparison.

review/summary: Okay for some but will not support a standing spoon...
review/text: I am not very good at using fancy words like "caramel" or "fragrant" but I'll use my commoner voice to write a review.  I grew up drinking english style tea with milk.  I have a penchant for strong breakfast tea with my ham and eggs.  It has always been difficult (although not impossible) to buy good english tea here in Texas. For a while I was able to find Taylors "Gold" in 8oz sizes but then it was discontinued.  SO I was excited when Amazon started carrying groceries and offering a wide selection of teas.<br /><br />Based on another review,  I ordered this Harrogate Tea Room blend thinking it would have that same bite to it as I was hoping to savor. I also ordered a case of good 'ol Typhoo Tea and the Taylor Harrogate English Breakfast tea, which has that strong - I guess that is the caramel or maybe "woody" aroma to it, similar to Taylors Gold. Whatever, it tasted like that first cuppa I drank when I was 7.  But the Tea Room blend struck me as rather bland and non-eventful.  And so it has sat there getting out of date while I savor through my supply of Typhoo and Breakfast blend.  I think if you want a black tea that is, shall I say, "neutral" and plain,  go for the Tea Room blend.  I suppose if you must cater to all comers, that is the safe route.<br /><br />I had to resort in the past to buying tea from Indian grocery stores which offer a wide variety of cheap teas that always have a musty aftertaste.  I guess that this type of brew is better served what I call "middle eastern" style - served without milk and heavily diluted with just a bit of the brew at the bottom of a cup (or glass) and then alot of hot water added upon serving.  This renders a very watery blend which I consider lousy at cutting through my heavy english breakfast.  I need something stout and tannic to cut through all that protein (and fat).<br /><br />So I'm rating this tea room blend 3 stars based upon expectations for ordering something I think offers nothing more than plain old Lipton.<br /><br />I must also add that I only drink loose tea.  Having always drank it this way,  tea bags to me just taste funny and are like what a frozen TV salisbury stake dinner is to grilled steak lovers.<br /><br />Anyway, I've recently ordered a bag of the Taylors Scottish blend, which I read as being stronger yet.  And I'm reading reviews that claim the Irish blend to be strong enough to stand a spoon up in the cup.  I can't wait.

review/summary: Tea Drinker from 'birth' one might say!
review/text: It has been a long and thirsty search for a good cuppa now I am no longer in the UK and until I found this I was getting very disappointed very quickly at how bad most of the tea available is.  Once I had decided to order this there was no going back, and damn the expense.  My philosophy being that as I hardly ever 'treated' myself it was about time I had something I really wanted...hence the subscription order for a constant supply on a regular basis, I was in heaven.  I was that is until it stopped!  My substitute is Yorkshire Gold, but it lacks the full-bodied taste I had grown fond of with the blend. YG is infact a better quality tea but none-the-less I still prefer the blended tea best.  Please, please please oh please bring the 1kilo bag of loose Tea Room Blend back to these shores, I really wouldn't mind a few bucks hike in price if it has to be so, but bring it back soon...

review/summary: This thing is ginormous!
review/text: Wow!  My dog has jaws of steel and can crack deer antlers, so I decided to go with this antler (and my dog is the size of a border collie).  I got the Amazon Prime delivery to my work... I work in an elementary school.  This antler is so big and heavy that I couldn't help laughing a little when I unwrapped it and showed it to my students.  They suggested perhaps I use it to smack them when they are naughty (I wouldn't...this was their suggestion).<br /><br />Anyway, it's about a foot long, an inch and a half in diameter, and must weigh about a pound and a half.<br /><br />The only thing one might worry about is that the thing feels like a piece of concrete.  A dog with a strong chew might break a tooth on it if he bit down the wrong way.<br /><br />My dog really chews on this, although he tends to lose interest in it unless I occasionally slap some peanut butter on the cut ends.  He'll chew on it when he gets bored, too, but he's mostly a chewer who likes to chew for a purpose, and he can't do too much damage to this.  Fortunately, he knows to not bite too hard, so no tooth damage has occurred.<br /><br />Keep an eye on your dog when he chews it, and avoid giving it to dogs who bite down too hard on things, especially if they have a history of chipping teeth.  Great for dogs with strong jaws.<br /><br />Oh, and don't throw this thing.

review/summary: Great for a week
review/text: I have tried antlers from different companies; my dog loves them all.<br /><br />This last order from Chasing our Tails had one as big around as my wrist. She typically  carries them with her just about everywhere when she's working on one, so keep that in mind. This very large antler lasted about one week; she lliterally  ate it. She is a larger than average English Bulldog, and a very strong chewer, but  it was down to 1 1/2" in days and had to be taken away. This one also smelled  really bad there at the end. It was leaving red ooze from the marrow- it was just unpleasant. I'm sure that's why this larger one lasted less than the typical 2 weeks; it was fresh and smelled strong.<br /><br />I'm going to use them again, but just a warning to keep an eye out- some of these are softer than others and get small fairly quickly.

It's just a subtle smell and it does fade after a week or so.)<br /><br />I probably could have gotten the smaller version.  But, this one is fine for our pooch.<br /><br />It is pricy, but I expect that this will out live my dog.

review/summary: Survives the Chocolate Labrador Jaws of Life!!
review/text: I was giving my 60lb dog these huge 12" rawhides but she would chew them up in a matter of a few hours. I also read that rawhides were dangerous as a big dog can bite off big chunks which can get lodged in their throats or stomachs. The other downside to rawhides are they get smelly, slimey and can stain carpets. The antler will not allow any of this. This extra large elk antler has survived her constant chewing for 3 months now and still looks almost as good as new. I will have to say at 1st she was a little wary of it, I do believe it is because it has a natural smell (Undetectable to my wife and I) but our dog was cautious when we 1st gave it her. Be aware this thing is heavy, it showed up and must weigh at least 1.5LBs! It is the best investment for a dog chew toy yet.

review/summary: The Dog Chew that Lasts
review/text: Like most dog owners we had not found a dog chew that would last for any length of time (that was not made of a synthetic polymer). We want to give our dogs something natural to chew on so that they were not constantly digesting plastic but we could not find anything in the market that would last.<br /><br />One weekend were up at a family mountain cabin when one of our dogs brought back a deer antler and was going nuts chewing on it. He chewed it the entire time we were up there and the antler barely lost any shape! So as soon as we got home we started doing some research and came across these elk antlers. We bought one to try them out and quickly learned what a mistake that was. Our dogs (one Aussie & two Shiba Inus) were constantly trying to take it away from on another. We quickly ordered two more and now the pack is happy!<br /><br />These antlers are fantastic.<br />#1 our dogs love them<br />#2 they are a natural chew<br />#3 they last (we have had our for 3 months and even after heavy use they are still in great shape)<br /><br />They may seem expensive to some customers, however the fact that they are natural and last as long as they do makes them a great value.

review/text: I had reservations about giving our dogs Elk horn - something about it just rubbed me the wrong way.We have two Old English Bulldogs our six year old Harley and his partner in crime, a seven month puppy named Elvis. Both are extreme, hardcore, aggressive chewers - these guys go through Kong's and Nylabones like a beaver buzzing through a 2 x 4.<br /><br />A dog lover my entire life - I was researching dog food long before there was an Internet. My better half and I of 25 years share a passion for our dogs that's hard to describe. They are in every way family and we indulge them to the same extent we watch out for them.<br /><br />Having been making my own dog food for 35 plus years, I've learned that research should never stop because there's always more to learn about keeping your dogs healthy and happy. According to one study by the Canadian Veterinary Journal elk horn is a healthy and wonderful addition to any dogs well being.<br /><br />Elk Horn offers a powerhouse of benefits:<br /><br />* Fights Arthritis<br /><br />* Replaces Joint Fluid<br /><br />* Effective in reliving pain from joint disorders and arthritis<br /><br />*  Natural preventative an treatment for osteoporosis<br /><br />* Easily digestible source of calcium and trace minerals<br /><br />* Cruelty Free - Elks naturally shed their antlers<br /><br />The list goes on - but that's a brief summary of the advantages. I ordered two of these and at first both Harley and Elvis took a while to play with them, lots of sniffing and walking away and then back to the horn for more sniffing and the occasional slurp. Then BAM! they couldn't get enough of these gigantic dinosaur bone sized chew toys.<br /><br />They spent hours chewing and gnawing away. Unlike deer antlers which dogs can crack their teeth on, this is much less likely with elk horn. Even when we tossed the both of  them on the bed to call it a night they each had their prized new elk horn in their mouths.Where they continued to chew and gnaw until they passed out.<br /><br />These things are huge! over 10" long and very heavy, the last thing you'll want to have happen is drop one on your foot.These make amazing toys for your dog - and considering how long they last they're an excellent value to boot.

review/summary: Arrived as described!  Very Large!
review/text: Picked up an original when vacationing in Maine and it was much smaller for $20 and our "grand-doggy" loved it!  I decided to picked her up a second one because she is an extreme chewer and thought this one would last much longer for her. The one we ordered arrived as described at 10 inches long with nice width as well. VERY HEAVY so watch your toes!!! Great value for the money! Thank you!

review/text: My dogs LOVE these. I had bought a smaller one in January and decided to go with a bigger size this time. I figured the smaller one is still going after 6 months so the bigger one should last years. My dogs chew on this everyday and barely make a dent. It keeps them occupied for hours and is definitely worth the money!!!

review/text: After reading the reviews, I purchased this elk antler for a 100 lb golden retriever.  She is quite the expert chewer!  I FINALLY found something that 1)she couldn't chew in 30 seconds 2) kept her interest 3)didn't stink like bones from the butcher and 4)is safe. I was also very suprised by the massive size of the antler I received.  It's the diameter of my wrist and the length of my forearm!  I cannot recommend this product highly enough!!

review/summary: Nice antler, my dogs aren't interested
review/text: As others have noted, this thing is huge.  If your dog likes it, it could be a good investment, because it's clearly indestructible and could last forever.  It has great ridges and shapes, things dogs usually like to chew on.  So why three stars?  My dogs don't chew it.  I have three dogs and one foster dog, of different sizes and breeds, so I'm surprised that not one of them likes it.  Especially since they loved deer antlers, which I stopped giving them because I had problems with splintering.  One dog - who will chew anything - nibbled on the edges a few times to get at the "marrow," but gave that up when it was clear that there was only so much marrow you could get.<br /><br />This seems like a good product IF your dog likes it, but in my house, four dogs say "meh." $30 down the drain.

review/summary: Fantastic!  Roscoe Loves it!
review/text: Our 1 year old boxer/pit-bull "pup" loves his antler! He is 70 lbs, and has a big old head with an alligator-like mouth.  Despite the fact he gets a lot of daily exercise, he still has plenty of energy and loves to chew in his spare time.  I ordered him the 10" size, which is perfect.  There is no odor, does not leave any mess, and has provided him hours of chewing fun already.  He prances around with it in his mouth, and prefers it to his other chew toys.  Would recommend this item to anyone with a dog who has big, strong chompers and loves to chew.  He has a synthetic nylabone which is said to be okay for dogs to ingest, but I am still leery about the shards that break off due to his gnawing, and also the rough edges that are created.  This antler is dense does not seem to splinter into pieces, and as it is all natural, I do not have any worries about him eating any pieces that my break off due to chewing. I plan to order another one for him, as well as a smaller one for his boxer cousin.

review/summary: My New Best Friend
review/text: I ordered the antler with the hopes it would be large enough..after reading about other antlers that were  really smaller than promised from other vendors. This antler was so big about 11 inches long and 6 inches around.This really is for a large dog. My 67lb. puppy has not put it down, nor made a dent in it. I saved all the info so I can order more. Well worth the price and the vendor is really reliable. Do your self a favor if you have a big chewer on your hands. No odor no mess all natural. Quick shipment. I can actually leave the room and do something else and come back and my dog is still holding the antler and gnawing away.

I like this coloring because I can get a variety of colors and the colors are true.  McCormicks has a very limited selection of colors and we have to mix colors which aren't very accurate when we make more batches of the same color.  The generic food color avaible in the stores are never accurate and the colors arent clear.  I am thankful I fould the Chefmaster food colors.

review/text: Best Peanut Butter EVER.  Natural, no hydrog. oils, taste like WC REESE cup! The stats are the same, 180 cals, per Tbsp, as reg peanut butter, but it is blended with some flavorings that make it OH SO delicious!!!  It is all natural, just crushed peanuts, really, with some flavoring, and homogenized so it doesn't really need to be stirred, which is often a turn off when buying the natural stuff.  I got a case of 6 for like 24 bucks on amazon, but now it is out of stock.  Wish they would get it back in, as I will go through about a case a month of this stuff.  Like to eat on a piece of toast after a hard workout.

review/summary: Pretty darn good!
review/text: I was looking for something peanut buttery but not just the usual thing and this fits the bill most excellently. The white chocolate flavor is decidedly an undertone to the peanut butter but it's there if you savor it a bit. Which is always a good way to have some of the nutty buttery goodness. Texture is nice and smooth, firm creaminess as it were. I'm going to have a sandwich of this for lunch today and I think a good, multigrain, thick-sliced bread would be just the ticket for a great PB sanny experience.<br />I'll definitely buy this again.

review/text: I purchased the Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, White Chocolate Wonderful, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6) by Peanut Butter & Co., directly from Amazon, in July 2011.  The expiration date stated Jan 2013, which is plenty of time to go through 6 jars of this tasty peanut butter.<br /><br />The listed ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Peanuts, evaporated cane juice, vanilla, cocoa butter, palm fruit oil, lecithin (from sunflowers), salt.<br /><br />The packaging also states that it is gluten-free and certified vegan.  This product doesn't require mixing, as some of the more natural peanut butters sometimes do.<br /><br />While I personally can't discern any white chocolate flavor, it is a very enjoyable peanut butter.

review/summary: Tastes Like Peanut Butter & Fluff!
review/text: Aside from being made from natural ingredients and no crazy fillers or preservatives, this stuff has an excellent flavor.<br /><br />I am a white chocolate lover, and I will say that this does not really taste like white chocolate (to me). Instead, it actually reminds me more of a fluffernutter flavor, which I also like very much. The best thing about this is that you can give your kids a peanut butter sandwich made with this stuff in lieu of a traditional peanut butter and jelly/fluff sandwich, and it has FAR less sugar and is made from superior ingredients.<br /><br />Works great as a snack straight up on a spoon as well. The kids consider it a dessert treat to get a spoonful ... but considering that is only 3-5 grams of sugar and made from peanuts, it's a healthier dessert option than all of the processed garbage that is out there these days.<br /><br />We also really enjoyed the dark chocolate dreams, we ordered a 6 pack of each.

I went to Target this baby was on sale so I decided to splurge and treat myself. I love white chocolate and I love PB.<br />So here's the review:<br />Pros:<br />Great texture, easy to spread<br />No mixing<br />Vegan<br />Few and good ingredients<br />Taste gets better the more you eat it<br /><br />Cons:<br />Doesn't really taste like white chocolate<br />So freaking sweet!<br />Tastes a little waxy<br /><br />Overall I consider it a good product, especially for anyone who usually eats commercial peanut butter. I think I'll stick to more natural peanut butter personally, but I'd wanted to try it for a while and was glad I did.

review/summary: not another like it
review/text: If you are into seeking healthy foods and really want to eliminate the caffeine in even  small amounts  that is found in any kind of chocolate except white...then you will enjoy eating this peanut butter. It truly is like eating a whipped Reeses peanut butter cup without the additives, the caffeine or the other chemicals.  Yes, it does have calories and fat.  But if you are seeking just a taste of something really, really tasty you will love this peanut butter.  But be careful not to use a spoon the first time or you may very well eat the whole jar in a very short time.  This peanut butter makes me sigh and smile.  Veggies and fruits and whole grains and lean proteins are the essential diet we all should follow but if you are inclined to cheat or treat yourself once in a while.  THIS is THE peanut better to eat.  Ordered the first 6 jars last month and now I  am back for more. Hopefully my self control is back in line. Yummy beyond words.

I like to alternate eating this and Dark Chocolate Dreams (another great flavor by this company). Since I've eaten several jars of this, I will say that sometimes with PB & Co products, the consistency of the peanut butter can vary from jar to jar. It doesn't bother me, but it's something I've noticed.<br /><br />As usual, this company cooked up a winner with this fantastic peanut butter!

review/text: This peanut butter is nothing short of perfection (in my opinion).  I'm not a peanut butter snob...Jif is perfectly fine when I need my peanut butter fix--be it on a sandwich or straight out of the jar by the spoonful.  Let me tell you that this White Chocolate Wonderful is WAY beyond normal peanut butter!  It is heaven in a jar!  I seriously ate half of my first jar last night...one delicious spoonful after another!  I didn't think it could get any better but once you spread it on a warm piece of toast and it melts a little bit it is even BETTER!  I don't really detect much white chocolate flavor...but it's got a noticeable hint of vanilla and a creamy-ness that is beyond description.  If you like peanut butter and vanilla you will LOVE this product!  My only problem is going to be not eating all 6 jars immediately :)

review/text: Oh How I Love...this peanut butter. It's just so good. It really is no stir, not any higher in carbs than other PB, and soooo tasty. I would be sad if they stopped making this PB, so order lots of it so they keep making it, but not so much that I can't still get it :)

review/summary: The most perfect peanut butter!
review/text: This product is a yummy, non oily alternative to traditional "natural" peanut butter.  It's smooth, with just a hint of white chocolate.  The weird thing is that I greatly dislike white chocolate in general, but I love this peanut butter.  It's all natural, but you definitely don't have to stir it, and it doesn't separate in a gross fashion like other brands.  Plus, if you order a 4 (or is it 6?) pack like I've been doing, you save a TON of money overall (vs. purchasing it at Whole Foods, etc.)  I'll definitely be re-ordering it as soon as I run out!

review/summary: This has converted me to a peanut butter lover!
review/text: I did NOT like peanut butter before trying this. I didn't even eat PB & J sandwiches as a kid. But my hubby loves PB and will put it on almost anything. So in his quest to convert me into a peanut butter advocate like him, he bought me a jar of Peanut Butter & Co White Chocolate from Walmart. I tried it and love it! I finished the jar by myself and have been fiending for more. I was putting it on everything: pancakes, waffles, crackers, fruit, bread, veggies (and bla bla bla). I'm currently out of town and have went to several stores looking for this PB because I am really craving it. I can't find it anywhere! So I came on trusty Amazon to see if there was any hope of finding my new love and Amazon has a 6 pack of this stuff! I can't guarantee my hubby that I'm ready to eat regular PB just yet but I'll be buying this PB until it goes out of production (which I hope is never).

review/text: This is my absolute favorite PB. I've been a PB lover for years, and this product tops them all! It's creamy and the hint of sweetness makes it a great breakfast, lunch, snack or even dessert! It's lower in sodium than Smucker's Natural, and less sticky. This is a great deal as well, one jar retails for $6 at the grocery store, which is a little fetchy for my budget. Now with Amazon, it gets delivered to my door at a great discount!

review/text: This is some good stuff!  It's sweeter than regular peanut butter, but not too sweet.  I love that it does not contain hydrogenated oils and it is sweetened with evaperated cane juice, rather than granulated sugar or corn syrup.<br /><br />I've only bought this once, so I don't know how much it usually runs.  My local grocery store doesn't sell it, but just recently I went into a store called "Christmas Tree Shops," and they had this pb priced at $2.99.  It sounded like a deal to me, since I thought it was more expensive.  I bought one jar of this and one jar of the Bee's Knees flavor.  Haven't tried the Bee's Knees, yet, but my family loves this flavor.  I just hate that the store is 45 min. away.  I was kind of hoping that Amazon would have just as good of a deal, so I could order it in bulk and have it shipped.  I wish I would have bought more than one jar.

review/text: I eat a lot of peanut butter, particular while pregnant because it happens to be one of my cravings.  This product is okay but not great.  It is a little sweeter than regular peanut butter and a little waxy.  I was given a gift of Peanut Butter of the Month Club and the white chocolate peanut version from that was better I thought and probably more appropriate for making Christmas candies and other things because the white chocolate flavor was a little stronger.

review/summary: The Best Alternative to Diet Sodas With Artificial Sweeteners
review/text: Whenever I drink a soda at home, it is always a Zevia soda.  Zevia has a refreshing cola flavor, while not being exactly like either of the big-brand diet colas.  I have noticed very little aftertaste from Zevia soda, much less than from regular diet soda.  From the reviews I've read, it's clear that you either really like this soda or you don't.  I really like this soda.  I was a big consumer of both big-brand diet colas for many years.  I really didn't like the artificial sweetener in the average diet soda.  Thank you to the people who make Zevia soda.  It is more expensive than regular soda, but I think it's worth it.  It is great to be able to enjoy a diet soda that tastes great and contains nothing artificial.  My only negative comment would be about what happens when you pour Zevia soda in a glass over ice.  The carbonation seems to dissipate very quickly when poured over ice.  Not to worry.  Drinking it right out of the can works fine for me.

The package itself only has padding on the top of the case of soda and not on the bottom.  The last case I received had 8 cans bulged out (from being dropped) ... 4 of them were so bad that they had ruptured and were almost entirely empty when I opened the box.<br /><br />The soda itself is great.  I get a case every month...but that will change for sure if I keep getting them damaged.  Switch back to UPS.  When I got them delivered UPS the boxes weren't dropped so hard the cans broke...

review/text: I am not a big soda drinker but I like to have a coke zero with lunch to help with the carb crash. I like coke zero better than diet coke as it has less of a bitter after taste and i like zevia cola better than coke zero for same reason. It's also carbonated a little lighter and the cola flavor is a little more subtle. I guess its kinda like a coke zero lite. I did my wikipedia research on it ingredients and if you are gonna drink sodas this is probably the least bad for you of anything out there. I won't be buying anymore coke, that's for sure.

review/summary: My Favorite Zevia -- Has Caffeine Though
review/text: This is the fourth Zevia flavor I've tried.  Orange was first, which I didn't like much.  Black cherry was next which wasn't bad but wasn't great either.  Next was root beer which I really enjoyed.  Finally, cola which I think is the best of the bunch.  I had tried to order the cola flavor earlier FedEx sent it back to Amazon after getting to the truck hub that services my house.  I don't know why it was sent back and my inquiries to Amazon were unanswered.  A lady on Amazon's 800 number wanted to reorder it for me but I had to explain that she couldn't due to stock and high shipping prices of third party sellers (more on that later).  But I finally got a case of it on my second try.  I love it and so does my wife.  The only problem with it is that it is the only Zevia soda that contains caffeine.  On the list of ingredients it says "caffeine 45mg from coffee".  That amount of caffeine is comparable to the amount you'd find in a Coke or Pepsi product.  That's not a deal breaker for me though.  I try to avoid caffeine as does my wife, but for a lot of people that would be a deal breaker.  I will continue to drink the caffeine free root beer flavor most often while treating myself to the cola flavor on occasion.  Out of the four flavors of Zevia I've had, cola is far and away better than orange and black cherry, while root beer is close behind in second.<br /><br />There are two major problems with ordering Zevia products.  First, they're expensive.  At just over a dollar a can they are pricey, no other way to describe it.  The second, is availability.  Amazon is really having some issues with keeping Zevia flavors in stock with Prime shipping.  The third party sellers all have exuberant shipping prices bringing your case of soda to over fifty dollars.  I've emailed Zevia about this and did get a response from them.  I hope Amazon can keep it stocked and Zevia can keep them supplied.  It's a good product but it's been frustrating trying to order due to Amazon's stock.  Due to the high price tag I put it on a monthly schedule to save 15%.  It helps but I wonder if Amazon will have it ready to go each month.<br /><br />The Zevia Cola is an great tasting soda.  I will be purchasing it again but not as often as I'd like due to the caffeine content.

review/summary: Fresh tasting calorie free cola with nothing artificial
review/text: I am so thrilled that there is finally a soft drink option that is not bad for you and is also affordable. The sweeteners used in other diet soft drinks are too risky to consume on a regular basis as they have been shown to cause health problems in some people. Stevia, which I have used in my coffee for years, is tasty and now has no bitter after taste as it did in its earlier days if you used too much. Since it is a plant and has not been fooled with by chemists converting it into something molecularly different, then I feel very good using it and have even gotten my 4 kids hooked on it. They just can't drink as many sodas since they are a bit more expensive, but definitely worth it.

review/summary: Tasteless
review/text: I'm utterly baffled by the positive reviews for this product.<br /><br />Now I've been using Stevia for the past year to sweeten my coffee. I have no issue with the Stevia.<br /><br />I used to drink a lot of soda, and then a few years back, a lot of diet soda. Since then, I've been able to give up soda altogether. But my Dad who is diabetic, is absolutely obsessed with diet coke. I've been trying to get him to lessen his diet coke intake (which is 1-2 a day) but he just waves me off. So I did some research, read the reviews, and bought 2 packs of the cola and lemon flavor each. I tried both to see how they tasted and was totally confused by this tasteless carbonated water. There was no taste! It literally just tasted like carbonated water with a vague hint of some flavor. I can't imagine anyone WANTING to drink this stuff, let alone rave about it.<br /><br />Did I get a bad batch? My Dad will never be able to transition from diet coke to this stuff, cause this stuff is truly awful.<br /><br />So disappointing. :(

As it chilled in my fridge, I thought about how it would taste. Would it be some kind of miracle Coke clone that proved God truly loved the world? Would it be revolting?<br /><br />Well, of those, it was the former, but add "Diet" before Coke.<br /><br />Yes, this soda has a distinct 'diet soda' taste to it, a kind of understated but sharp bittersweetness. So while it is pretty not bad, it is definitely diet.<br /><br />Should you buy some? If you're used to Diet Coke, absolutely. But if you insist on regular pop or nothing, try another flavor. I got root beer in the same trip, which is pretty good. But honestly, I don't know that I'll get another pack of the cola for a while.

review/text: This is a GREAT product!  No artificial anything. Wish it wasn't so pricey - that's why I gave 4 instead of 5.  I would recommend to anyone trying to avoid sugar and all the artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: Different kind of taste
review/text: If you're the Canada Dry kind of soda drinker where it's not too sweet, you may like this. For me it's "EHHHHHHH!" Stevia is one of the many healthy alternative sweeteners especially for diabetics on the market but there are others that I personally like better. It's a preference thing.

review/text: I drank 3 of the drinks, one on 3 different days to realize that the feeling of high level heartburn and a low level general nausea that did not go away for days, was due to this cola.  I didn't recover from the 3 drinks completely for about a week.  The taste was only good if the drink was ice cold.  I did receive a refund.

review/summary: Most expensive drink I've had in a long time...
review/text: Today I was excited to try a natural cola with no calories.  The 6-pack of cans I purchased was $4.99.  I took one sip.  Dumped the can and will not be trying the rest of this stuff.  In other words I paid the equivalent of $49.19 an once.  (Based on how much I was able to stomach...)

review/summary: Very good, plus it won't make you a FATTY FATTERSON
review/text: Hello Ms. Fatty Fatterson... that was what I used to say when looking in the mirror. I would sip those Diet Cokes (mmm don't you love the taste of fresh asphartine in the morning?!), whilst rotting my brain out with chemicals.<br /><br />What I like about this is that it is ALL NATURAL. And uses a friggin plant (Stevia) with a zero-glycemic index(no sugar, to all you other piggies out there).<br /><br />Woot girls! The answer to office soda pop is finally here.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: I knew I had to do something to get away from my diet coke habit; the artificial sweetener was causing health issues for me.  Zevia was recommended to me so I tried it.  The best change I ever made!  I am a Zevia drinker now and there is no turning back! (Ordering from Amazon and having it delivered to my door is a big plus too!)

review/summary: So disappointed
review/text: I am so horribly disappointed in this product. I've looked forward to trying it for months, and finally ordered some online when I found a good deal. I try really hard to limit the amount of sugar in my diet, but also avoid artificial sweeteners at all costs (I'd rather just have the sugar). As soon as this arrived, I cracked open a can, poured it over ice into a glass & took a whiff. It smelled great--like a regular cola! It looked right--perfect color, lots of carbonation, etc. But that's as far as it went with the positives... as soon as I tasted it, I shuddered--literally. It tastes like an extra sweet version of Diet Pepsi (my most HATED soda, ever). The sweetness is sickening, tastes NOTHING like a sugar-type of sweetness, and leaves a really metallic taste in my mouth. I tried several times to choke it down, thinking that maybe I'd get used to it after a few sips--but no, I ended up dumping the rest down the drain. I wish I had tried just ONE can instead of ordering a 24 pack! I'm so bummed out--guess it was just too good to be true.

review/text: This product has been a life saver for me! I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes during my 6 month of pregnancy and one of my man cravings is coca cola which is an absolute no-no. Zevia cola over ice satisfies my craving without all the harsh harmful chemicals of mainstream diet soda.

review/summary: What a disappointment.
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KUSLGY">Zevia All Natural Soda, Cola 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />I'm all for Stevia. It's my sweetener of  choice, and I just ordered another bottle of "Pure Stevia  Extract". I even have a few Stevia plants growing outside. HOWEVER, this drink is something else. I foolishly ordered a whole case of the stuff, and I'm now trying to figure out what to do with it. Drinking it is definitely "not on the table", but it might be good for washing the driveway. We'll see. Anyway, not wishing to waste any adjectives, I'll just say that, despite the unbelievable positive comments above, it's not something that any normal person would be willing to try more than once. It's not vile. It's not a nasty of the spitting-out kind, but it's just something you would never want to try for more than one sip. Don't buy it.<br /><br />Addendum:  I failed to describe its taste. Well, as I've said, it's not nasty, but the thought that occurs to you during the first sip is, "Why am I drinking this?" It lacks effervescence, it doesn't taste good, and it doesn't even have the sweetness you'd expect. It does have some kind of taste, but the closest I can come to describing it is to have you think of brewing  a weak tea from some weeds in your garden. I haven't done this, but I think your brew wouldn't be too different from this stuff.

review/summary: Still Addicted to Diet Coke
review/text: ****Update****<br /><br />I have continued to try with this product.  I hated the thought of spending the money and just tossing the rest of these....  I will admit it gets easier to drink the more you try.  (Maybe I'm starting to get used to it?)  I will say the aftertaste still is awful, but at least I'm more used to it.  It taste much much better if you drink it ICE COLD.  Once it starts to lose the 'coldness' I'm finding that I can't really stomach it.<br /><br />My friend purchased the Dr.Zevia instead of the cola.  (She's in love with diet Dr. Pepper.)  I tried one of hers and it truly tasted (and smelled like) cough syrup.<br /><br />So, at least I can say that the Cola is better than that.<br /><br />I will keep trying......I hope.<br /><br />======================================================<br /><br />I am almost in awe at some of these perfect reviews....<br /><br />Let me start by saying, I've been having a mad love affair with Diet Coke for several years.  I figured since it has zero calories, then no harm done.  However, I recently started a 40 day purge diet that requires no Diet Coke.  However, my doctor said that I could have this instead.  After researching Zevia, I found that a couple of their sodas have caffeine (yea!)  Since I love Diet Coke, I decided to give Zevia Cola a try.<br /><br />The verdict?....<br /><br />It's not the worst soda I've ever tried....but close.  At first, it's not so bad, but the aftertaste is TERRIBLE!  Way way way too sweet!  (If you are used to Diet Coke, you will definitely not be a happy camper.)  If it weren't for the fake sugary aftertaste, it wouldn't be too bad.<br /><br />I realize that Zevia isn't Diet Coke....but I was still disappointed.  When you calculate the cost....it's just too expensive to keep buying, especially if I won't drink it.  If you have a local specialty store, try buying one there to 'try' before you end up buying a whole case that you may or may not like.<br /><br />I was thinking about trying the Mountain version (also has caffeine), but since trying this one, will definitely have to reconsider.

review/summary: So delicious
review/text: This is my favorite soda, the Cola is delicious and it really wakes you up if you're tired. I like the taste of Zevia sodas better than other Stevia sodas. My favorite is the Root Beer, but the Cola is a close second. There's even a caffeine free version of the Cola if you cant have caffeine.

review/summary: The best soda I have ever had.
review/text: Zevia Natural Diet Soda is exactly what you would expect from an outstanding beverage.  It is void of artificial sweetners that cause all kinds of problems for the body.  There is really nothing diet about the flavor or drinking experience.  It has every sense of a regular cola with sugar, without the sugar.  There is no after taste or lingering strange feelings after consumption.  It is purely a great beverage with no strings attached.  I see Zevia as a strong mainstream beverage of the future.  I believe in this product, and would invest futures into this company.

review/summary: looking for a sugar substitute?
review/text: Zevia was highly recommended as an artificial sweetener substitute...  but as I found out the hard way, the sugar alcohol it contains is not compatible with a lot of people. Let's just say I was grounded for a day.  Very nasty side effects.
