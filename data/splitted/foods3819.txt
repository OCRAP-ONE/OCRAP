review/summary: TAZO Organic Apple Red is GREAT, buy some
review/text: The following recommendation is based on having tried over 100 tea varieties in the last 2 years.<br /><br />Tazo Organic Apple Red tastes great. It may be the best few dollars you spend for 20 teabags<br />that is organic, caffeine free, smells delightful and tastes divine.<br /><br />Try it.

review/summary: Just like caramel apple pie...without the fat
review/text: Positively fantastic!<br />The notes all blend very well together. The cinnamon doesn't overshadow the apple and caramel flavors. The rooibos is an excellent base for this blend. It adds a lovely sweetness.<br />This tea is great with or without sugar.

review/summary: Strongest, tastiest Organic Decaf Tea on the market. I LOVE it!
review/text: I have gone through every different type of organic decaf tea that I can get my hands on. Most of them have been disappointing because of weak taste. TAZO's Organic Red Herbal Infusion Caffeine Free tea is hearty with full flavor and the individual bags seem top quality. I have stock-piled it and plan to use it as my main tea.

review/summary: It smells like Vicks Vapor Rub!!
review/text: I was excited to try this.  I got some as a gift.  I am glad I got it as a gift and didn't pay one penny for it.  Out of the bag, the tea smells like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CP15G8">Vicks VapoRub Topical Cough Suppressant Ointment, 50-gram Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>.  Yeah, that's an ointment and not a tea.  I've had a lot of different red teas and none of them smelled this much like medicine.  As it brewed, I wondered if the cough drop like scent would brew out.  I couldn't even sniff it because it smelled so unappetizing.  Any apple scent here had to be adding to the almost chemical artificial odor of the tea.  It settled into a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P500U0">Ricola  Cough Drops, Natural Herb , 21 Drops (Pack of 12)</a> type scent and after three minutes, I could smell a tiny bit of apple.  So I decided to sip it once it cooled. I put some sugar in it, in case I had some vapor rub in a cup on my hands.  It is ok.  It's got a slightly lemonish apple taste and isn't overly offensive, except when out of the bag and brewing.  But I enjoy taking a tea bag out and smelling it, so this lowered my pleasure of making the tea.  I am not really sure why people like Tazo because I always think their teas are just average at best. Some are downright horrible like their Passion tea and their Chai is just meh.  It's pretty expensive for what it is.  Is the money going to the pseudo Zen design or what?  I guess if you like Starbucks coffee, you probably are all into this too, but I prefer better coffee and teas.  Tazo's teas don't seem high quality to me.<br /><br />I'll give the tea one star because it didn't taste like Vicks Vapor Rub or make me sick.  The little apple and cinnamon flavor to the blend is worth one star.  I wouldn't recommend this tea to anyone.  I kept one bag to try once I brew it for longer.  Maybe after five minutes, it will blossom into life, but my hopes aren't very high.  It's hard for me to open another bag of this and not try to smell the unpleasant medicine odor coming out of it.

review/summary: Disappointing or Delicious?
review/text: As someone who has formerly raved about Tazo's Teas I can say that my first experience with this tea was less than satisfactory. Using two teabags with 12 ounces of water produced a flavorless tea that didn't even have the hint of cinnamon let alone the fragrance of apples. Realizing that the weakness of the tea was the reason for my dissatisfaction I tried brewing the tea by using four teabags and 12 ounces of water. This produced a very acceptable tea with a full-bodied taste and the delicious fragrance of freshly picked apples. The ingredients in this tea include: African Rooibos, cinnamon, natural flavors, apple and chamomile. While this tea is not a five-star tea it is at least slightly comforting in the winter and if you brew it for longer than you would normally brew tea then you might find it to be delicious instead of disappointing.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Since I usually drink Japanese coffee or Vietnamese coffees, they are very strong coffees, and I had a few weeks of discomfort going off coffee.<br /><br />The roastaroma is a really good coffee substitute.

review/text: A long-ago discovery for me, Roastaroma will always be a regular in my favorite teacups, alongside other Celestial Seasonings stars. Roasted barley and chicory combined with cocoa-copycat carob, hint of something similar to mocha for those who wish to avoid coffee and even chocolate; and the touches of cinnamon, allspice and star anise gives this brew an extra special lift. For those who wish to add a little cocoa to the mix before adding your brand of milk or cream to top it off, this perfect blend is a lovely pick-me-up any time of the day or night, and particularly throughout the cooler months when a warm cup of something special comforts the soul.<br />Kerri Bennett Williamson, Author<br /><br />P.S.

review/summary: Not coffee - more like Cinnamon Tea
review/text: I purchased Roastaroma along with a number of other products, trying to find a substitute for coffee which, along with just about everything else I like, I can no longer consume. Some previous reviews have not been all that accurate, sorry to say. This is actually a tea which tastes nothing, repeat, nothing like coffee. It's more like a cinnamon tea, and a slightly strange tasting cinnamon tea at that. If like me, you are looking for a coffee substitute, I'd recommend Cafix or Caf-Lib. They are the best I've found so far, Cafix being the slightly better of the two. Do they taste like coffee, you ask? Well, they taste like an ok decaf. They work ok for me, because I like to use a liquid non-dairy sugar free creamer such as International Delight.<br /><br />That these other products fall short of real coffee isn't that much of a surprise. Consider how even decaf coffees don't quite taste comparable to the real caffeinated products. If they can't get those to taste closer, then I can understand the challenge in trying to get chicory, dandelions etc to fit the bill.

review/text: I just flat out didn't like this stuff.  The roasted barley / chicory flavor is very strong and distinct, with an aftertaste of extremely burnt popcorn kernels.  I tried it with a touch of half and half (which is how I like my coffee), and that didn't do much to dull the flavor.  After numerous cups prepared various ways, I gave up on this blend.  I would advise anyone reading this to try it, though...the taste may be polarizing but it's not bad by any stretch.

review/summary: If you can't drink coffee, drink roastaroma!
review/text: Let me preface this review by saying that I never used coffee primarily as a CNS stimulant. I always favored caffeinated coffee because it tastes better. I also always liked my coffee creamed, sweetened, and preferably flavored as mocha, french vanilla, hazelnut, etc. The one exception for me was Guatemalan coffee, which I preferred unflavored with cream and sweetener.<br /><br />That being said, I have tried Ayurvedic, Teeccino (Maya and Mocha), and Roastaroma as coffee substitutes. I had no desire to try Pero or Cafix, since they are designed to mimic straight coffee, which I do not prefer anyway.<br /><br />For a straight coffee substitute, I think Ayurvedic is the best: smooth, dark, and healthful. But a little pricier than the others.<br /><br />Teeccino is very good, but tends to brew with a lot of sediment in the cup and makes for a messy cleanup after brewing.<br /><br />I have settled on Roastaroma because it is cheap, tastes better than any of the others in my opinion, and is mindlessly easy to make.<br /><br />Two bags in a 15 oz. mug and hot water. Steep, throw away the bags, and cream and sweeten to taste. Voil&aacute;! It has a very smooth, cinnamon nutty cocoa taste. Really fine!<br /><br />I don't miss coffee one tiny bit!<br /><br />Thanks, Celestial Seasonings!<br /><br />'Tis da bomb!

I was expecting to have to put milk and maybe sugar in it like I do with coffee (not a fan of black, sorry) but I'm really liking it plain. Might change it up eventually, but on its own it's very good, a unique and interesting flavor. A little burnt. I like burnt.

review/text: I rescued my girl, Daisy, 11 1/2 years ago. She is very particular about her toys and will only play with these type of balls. Ten years ago, they could be easily found in various pet stores, but have since become more & more difficult to locate. I was thrilled when I searched online and came across them. Daisy goes through 1 ball per month. When I say "goes through" them, I mean she plays really hard. Not only does she play soccer with them, but bites & carries them around too. After about a month, the rubber does start to come apart, so I throw them away from fear that she could ingest pieces. I recently ordered 60 (15 packs with 4 balls in each) of them for her. She reassures me it was the best money I could have ever spent every time I see her batting them around the house!

review/text: These macadamias arrived in 2 plastic bags, stuffed into a USPS flat-rate envelope.  The envelope was a bit torn, but the bags were intact.  The soft packaging could have resulted in a lot of broken nuts, but they seemed to come though just fine.<br /><br />I'm still experimenting with roasting times and temperatures.  Best results so far:  soak for a few minutes in a strong salt water solution, drain, spread out in a single layer in a baking pan, sprinkle with black pepper, then 25 minutes in a 250-degree oven, jiggling them around a few times along the way for even heating.  A bit soft when they come out of the oven, nice and crunchy once they cool.  I wouldn't say that they are BETTER than the dry-roasted I buy at the store, but just as good at a lower price, with minimal hassle. I'll probably order the 5-pound next time.

I've had raw mac nuts from another manufacturer and you could definitely taste the difference. It's possible these have been very lightly roasted. Regardless, they are great and crunchy. You can certainly roast them if you want. No salt which is a huge plus. I love salt but let's be reasonable. Other mac nuts sold here (see my other review) would be stellar if not for the copious salt. Again a plus for these.<br /><br />Someone mentions packaging. Be happy the seller is sending it priority mail. It may not be pretty but it was taped well and was secure at least for me. Rather receive it expedited (no additional charge) than for it to be a showpiece I receive 2 weeks later.<br /><br />Enjoy your nuts and share them with a friend!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!
review/text: This doesn't even deserve one star, but they won't let you post without it.  My husband bought these bully sticks in mid May.  When they arrived, I was happy to see that the company was thinking ahead and put the sticks into a resealable plastic bag.  However, when I took the bag out of the box, I realized the inside looked like there were BUGS!  I took the entire thing outside and THERE WERE BUGS!  Mostly dead ones, but they were on the inside of the bag.  Thinking that maybe somehow in shipping they got into the item, I did not immediately complain to the company (MY WORST MISTAKE!).  I took ALL 50 sticks out and wiped them down and then put them into a new bag and stored them for our puppy.  However, EVERY time I go to take a new stick out of the bag I see more dead bugs!  Yesterday was the breaking point, I went to take a stick out and a LIVE bug crawled onto my finger!  I finally decided to contact the company who sent me a very generic email back saying it was over 30 days and they want nothing to do with my complaint.  SO to help prevent others from making the same mistake we did, I am posting this review to let you know DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM BBS!  Needless to say I have just thrown out the remaining bully sticks that we ordered.  In these economic times, FLUSHING AWAY almost $100 is not something I want to do!  DON'T do what we did.  The price seems ok, but it is NOT worth the aggravation!

review/summary: Not recommended for under a year!
review/text: I tried this for my 6 month old, who had a bad reaction apparently to the raspberries, as he had been introduced to pears prior to that. My pediatrician chastised me and said that berries of any kind shouldn't be introducted to infants until they are at least a  year old. We love Earth's Best baby foods, but now I know to do extra research and not assume that just because the label says "6 months and up" doesn't make it okay!

review/summary: great baby food makes great babies
review/text: mmmm. Feeding my children Earth's Best baby food really makes me feel like I'm giving the best to my kids.<br />It tastes good, looks good, and is organic. Who could ask for more?<br />Normally I make and cook everything myself for my babies, ( I have 2 and a 3rd on the way) but I have learned to<br />strongly DISLIKE preparing food with raspberries. Too much of my time is spent straining the seeds, so I did some math and the time I<br />waste doing all the work, I earn back time with my girls by conveniently purchasing Pears & Raspberries.<br />Earth's Best Pears & Raspberries are a staple in my cupboard.

review/summary: Yum!!
review/text: My nine month old LOVES this baby food!!! She devours the entire jar every time it's offered to her! With other foods I'm lucky if she finishes half a jar. This past week she wasn't feeling very well and had little appetite. She would drink a little bit of formula and her juice but turned her nose at any type of food that was offered to her. Seeing as this is her favorite I thought she would eat a little bit if I offered it to her but she ate the entire jar in one sitting! I'm very impressed with Earth's Best as well as Amazon customer service. One package of baby food that I ordered arrived with a broken jar and all it took was an email to Amazon and my money was refunded! Another food my daugher really enjoys is the Sweet Potato Cinnamon. She loves sweet potatoes and I like that she's getting the added benefits from the cinnamon. I will continue to purchase Earth's Best, especially pears and raspberries, from Amazon!

review/summary: No Challenge to Get 10-Month Olds to Eat This One
review/text: My twin 10-month olds made short work of this one when they were first introduced to it.  Each baby finished a 4 ounce jar of the pears and raspberry flavor Earth's Best very quickly.  Since then whenever they get a jar of it, they react with the same enthusiasm.<br /><br />One reason I indulge them with the Earth's Best brand for the pears and raspberry combination is that it is not so easy for me to get anything like it without buying whole fruit or finding a substitute such as using cans.  I'm so busy with these twins that I don't go far.  This purchase is convenient.  However, with applesauce-based food for the babies, I can buy large and more economical jars at the grocery store (the unsweetened varieties).<br /><br />I'm confident almost any baby will love this Earth's Best flavor combination right away.  Here are the listed ingredients: Organic pears, organic raspberries, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), citric acid.  One serving has 25% of the daily vitamin C needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.

review/summary: So Cheap and Delicious
review/text: No one has reviewed this, but I wanted to fill people in on it. I had the hardest time and never came up with a straight answer on what I really wanted to know.<br /><br />HOW MANY BARS COME IN THIS PACKAGE?! Giving me the ounces is nice and all, but it didn't really help me fully know how many bars are in the pack, and the stock image is of a 5 bar pack.<br /><br />There are 16 of these bad boys in here, in one of the counter displays from the store (the little cardboard box that the top rips off). But don't eat all of these in one day or you will be messed up. At like 35% your daily value of fiber, you would be like 560% your daily value - which is really dangerous.<br /><br />So do what I do and eat about one every day or so, when I need a healthy delicious snack.

review/summary: Brinjal Pickle (Egg Plant Relish) makes life worth living!
review/text: Patek's Egg Plant Relish (formerly called Brinjal Pickle) is my all-time favorite relish.  A wonderful complement to poultry and many meats (especially ground chuck), I alone go through several jars a year, combining it most often with chicken.  It is sweet, and only mildly hot, allowing its delicious spiced flavors to be thoroughly enjoyed.  It has a wonderful aroma and aromatic after-taste on the back of the palate that provides an almost transcendental experience.  Yet, used in moderation, it doesn't overpower, but rather enhances the meat dish.<br /><br />This is not a relish that everyone enjoys, however.  Its taste is unique, and not the fire-hot peppery blast that many people seem to enjoy and be seeking.

review/summary: A "Must Have" for our dogs
review/text: Our dogs need to chew.  We feel comfortable with this product because there are no little pieces breaking off as possible chocking or digestive hazards. The dogs love it and could work on it for hours, but we set a time limit and save the treat for another day.  That way it lasts for quite awhile.  We prefer the ones that are wheat free. Most dog treats contain wheat which our dogs can't have so that's another plus. The biggest problem is fitting the treat into the ball, but if that were easy it would also be easy for the dogs to get it out! This product is safe and fun.

review/summary: Use with caution
review/text: This toy definitely kept my guy busy. Unfortunately when he ate a chunk of it, it also kept my vet busy.<br /><br />I only allowed my dog to use this when I was around and gave it to him in the ball holder but he still managed to swallow a piece. It got stuck for a bit in his gut and caused him to throw up anything he ate and quite a bit of discomfort. Fortunately since this is a digestible item he was able to pass it without the need for surgery.<br /><br />My dog is a STRONG chewer and very determined, so you may have better lick, I mean luck, if your dog isn't so intent on liberating it from the holder.<br /><br />Also, if your dog has a Wheat/Corn/Soy allergy, be sure to test this with them before giving them the whole thing. I can't say for sure, but I suspect the package we had was NOT wheat-free b/c the boy reacted to it much like he does when he eats something with wheat in it. Unfortunately I didn't put that together in time to prevent what was described above.

I am not sure how a normal dog that can eat other things would like them, but he is allergic to everything so he likes them quite well. We use the Bento ball with them.

review/text: I've always been a fan of Honey Bunches of Oats. I find that it's the perfect balance of taste and health. The best part is that my kids actually love this as well. This is significantly healthier than many of the sugar cereals that are marketed to kids. Even my 1 yo enjoys eating this dry. Between this and Honey Nut Cheerios, I don't have to feel guilty about giving my kids "bad" cereal.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you can't beat Amazon's Subscribe & Save. My family of six will work through these five boxes pretty quick. Thanks Amazon!

review/text: This is the same old cereal you can get everywhere, and anyone who as tried it is bound to love it. But 5 18 ounce boxes at this price is great. Much cheaper per box then the 14.5 once box at the market. And the almonds are oh so good.

review/summary: This is why I love Amazon
review/text: Obviously, I don't need to write a review about the cereal itself. I would think you already love the cereal if you come searching for it on Amazon. I pretty much use Amazon for a good 90% of purchases and was ecstatic when I saw this on the site. A pack of 5 family sized cereals for a low price, delivered and waiting for my house after 2 days (via Amazon Prime)?! I'm sold! I already buy everything else on Amazon, why not cereal too? It was shipped quickly, the cereal was the same you would get any grocery stores. The deal seemed like a no brainer to me.

review/summary: The cheapest way to buy cereal. Period.
review/text: My wife and I love this cereal. Not too sweet, and pretty nutritious. Although it might seem weird to order groceries online, Amazon's Subscribe and Save has the best price per ounce BY FAR. Yeah, you may have a few extra boxes sitting in the garage or pantry for a while, but it's cereal. It saves very well. And if you find yourself not eating cereal for a while, just reschedule your next Subscribe and Save delivery. Fantastic deal.<br /><br />Also, the actual cereal isn't in any worse shape than if you were to buy it at the store. It's not like it's a back full of corn powder from shipping. Same product, same quality, just a lot cheaper!

review/summary: Tastier than I expected!
review/text: The first thing that attracted me to this cereal was the subscribe and save price. About $12.00 for 5 family size boxes and they bring it to my doorstep? Yeah, I'll have some of that, thank you. Even though I imagined an oat flake cereal to taste somewhat bland I thought it would be healthier than the sugar cereals we were eating and I was prepared to foist it on my family under some protest. I was happy to find no foisting was necessary. They ate it up. I ordered more. Kids, adults, even sullen teenagers have all eaten it at with equal enthusiasm.  I don't think you will be disappointed if you try it.

review/text: I would have given this product five stars, but I didn't receive five boxes. We only received four boxes and they were delicious and weren't going to expire until the end of 2011. It was more fresh than cereal you buy at the store. However, contacting Amazon was very inconvenient and took a really long time to get it straightened out because of language barriers. We are trying it again and if we receive all five I'm sure I will give it five stars.

review/summary: Has a nice Seafood Port Taste
review/text: I would probably use a little starch or flour to thicken it up a bit if you like your chowder bisque-y like I do.  I used coconut milk instead of regular dairy, but I did add a little butter, parsley, and lots of pepper.  I season everything I eat, but I usually make my own soup, just thought I'd try this out. We put the extra in single containers and froze them, so the large amount is really not a problem.  It reheated fine.  I would definitely buy this product again should I get a hankering for canned chowder.

review/summary: What The Hemp Is It?
review/text: This review refers to Living Harvest Hempmilk - Unsweetened Original - 32oz fl. oz<br /><br />So when I saw this at my local grocery, right next to my favorite soymilk display, my first thought was, what is it?, and will I get arrested for buying it? I considered it it any case, as I love my soymilk and use it in any meal instead of milk, but there was one instance where soy wasn't working for me. That was in my coffee. Soy breaks up in hot coffee and looks ugly, so I was using Lactaid(Lactose free milk)for that.The Hempmilk was on sale - usually costing twice as much as the soy product - so I said what the hemp, and bought a carton of the unsweetened(as I do with the soy).<br /><br />so first things first - what is hemp? - From the back of the box - "... transforms tiny hemp seeds into the creamiest and delicious hemp milk you can buy....." - still what is it? I had to get out my trusty Webster's - d.'Indian plant of which the fiber is used to make rope.'- as well as other stuff I HEARD about. Anyway so this is made from the seed of that plant. And according to the box it is packed with lots of vitamins. It's a good source of Vit A, Calcium Vitamin D,Ribolflavin, B12, and Phosphorus. It has 0 sugar, 0 cholesterol and only 1g total carbohydrate. All good stuff.<br /><br />So far okay, but here come the two big tests for me - taste, and how did it fare in my coffee. I thought the taste wasn't anything speical, kind of like nothing - white water, and that's exactly how it was in my coffee as well. Not very creamy(as promised), it just barely changed the color of my coffee to brown from black. Although I have to say it did not break up the way the soy does, but it wasn't creamy or tasty enough to switch over from soy for me - and the higher price wasn't getting any points either.<br /><br />Also, there is only 1g of protein. That about did it for me. The soy has 9g. There are some nutrients that are higher in the Hemp(the Vit A and C for instance) - but I get plenty of that in the food I eat.<br /><br />I would say, if for some reason soy is not working for you, you may want to give this a try. It may not be as rich and creamy as stated, but it doesn't taste bad, and it does supply some good nutrients.(Which is why it gets 3 stars from me - okay, but nothing to write home about) But for those who love your soymilk - no reason to switch here.<br /><br />Here are all the ingredients(from the box):<br />Hemp Nut Base(Filtered water),Hemp nut(shelled hemp seed),natural flavors,tricalcium phosphate,carrageenan,sea salt,vita palmitate,vitD2,riboflavin,vitB12<br /><br />By the way, the ingredients on my soymilk box is , filtered water, organic soybeans<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTI6BI">Westsoy Soymilk, Unsweetened Original, 64-Ounce (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />So remember to breathe, eat healthy and..enjoy.....Laurie

review/summary: Low Carb, Allergy Friendly, Great Tasting, Non-Dairy Milk
review/text: I really enjoy both Living Harvest Original Hempmilk Unsweetened along with Living Harvest Hempmilk Vanilla Unsweetened. Of all the Milks that I have tried (Almond, Coconut, etc.), these are my favorite for just drinking and for baking and cooking with. They are both Low Carb, which is a big plus, (only 1 Carb per cup of milk) (2) Two they both taste good,(It has a refreshing nutty taste, closer in taste to real milk)(3)three they don't have any sugar cane or any other sweeteners mixed in or any odd chemicals or ingredients that would be bad for you, which is a huge plus for me, and (4) Fourth I love the fact that it has Omega 3's packed naturally into the milk. Hemp naturally has its own Omega 3's, so it's not added it's there naturally. AND Omega 3's are really important for the brain. So, since I can't drink Raw Milk, because of Casein sensitivities. . .I now choose Living Harvest Original and Vanilla unsweetened to drink and cook with. I hope they will continue to make these two milks.

review/summary: Very good relief; natural anti-inflammatory
review/text: I sustained severe trauma to my upper torso due to a horseback riding incident over 25 years ago.  My C-2,3,4 and 5 discs were ruptured, but as a result of my youth I achieved what seemed at the time a complete recovery.  However, as the years have progressed, the injuries have taken their toll.  I have been to medical doctors and specialists repeatedly, but only for moderate and temporary relief of the pain from the grinding together of the discs.  The lengthiest relief I acquire is through massage  with the mustard rub and copious quantities of curcumin taken orally. The rub does work for me for several hours at a time.  The edge is taken from the pain and I'm able to go about a somewhat normal lifestyle (which does include regular PT exercises as well, but I've been able to dodge further surgery and addictive painkillers thus far).

review/summary: Exactly what are they selling?
review/text: When I found this on Amazon, I was about to order... then I had to stop short:<br /><br />How can I have any idea what they're offering for $12?<br /><br />I've heard of buying garlic by weight, or by the individual bulb... but "PACKED IN OUR MEDIUM SIZE JAR. ... 6 INCHES TALL"?  What does that mean? I've seen 6" tumblers that hold eight ounces of water... and 6" champagne flutes holding only half that. How much does a 6" jar hold if we don't know its diameter? (Or even if we do, but don't like to do the math.)<br /><br />Particularly when the picture shows their lovely 6" jar only about two-thirds full? Yes, I know the product settles when shipped. That's why everybody else sells dry products by weight.<br /><br />It gets stranger. The page says "NET WEIGHT: 8 OUNCES". It also says "Shipping Weight: 7.2 ounces"!<br />I can only guess that their 6" jar includes an anti-gravity feature.<br /><br />I'll admit this is the first product I've reviewed on Amazon that I haven't actually bought. Maybe I will in the future, if somebody tells me what I'd be paying for. And if they update their page to include a meaningful cost per ounce, I'd be glad to pull this review.

I use three or four parts decaf (from another company) to one part Fog Chaser and that one part really perks up the decaf flavor.

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: Great Chip
review/text: Our local TJ's used to carry these, but no more.  There's a Costco 30 miles away, but that seems too far to travel for a bag of chips.  I finally did the subscribe & save to get them on a more regular basis.<br /><br />I like these chips very much, they have good texture & flavor.  They hold up to dip as well.  I've tried the salt & vineger and the cheese flavors, but plain is still my favorite.
