review/summary: Great product
review/text: I bought the honey for my mother with multiple problems.  It has healed a tear in her skin in half the time it normally takes, and has helped with an infection she has that the antibiotics have not been able to cure.  It is applied topically & added to tea and health food store cranberry juice.

review/summary: Manuka Honey 16+
review/text: Manuka Honey 16+ is a "health" staple in our house. I began having digestive problems, and after taking medication for just a short period of time, decided I didn't want to just cover up a problem with drugs but to get to the root and heal the discomfort. While researching the internet, I came across manuka honey. And, after reading the many benefits of this honey, I decided to test its effectiveness...Within two weeks, I began to feel much better. When I first began taking it, I took one teaspoon a few times a day. Now that I'm feeling much better, I take one-half teaspoon of manuka honey a day. I now have no digestive problems. Manuka honey is a potent and healthy alternative for healthly living...

review/summary: Great honey - Best Manuka I have found by far
review/text: Best tasting Manuka I have found so far, this one lacks the 'earthy/eucalyptus' flavor the others have.  Can be overpowering if you are using to sweeten a beverage and are using regular Manuka.  I use this daily in my tea or coffee.  I actually first started with the three bottles as a test run, I now bought the larger 40 ounce size and think I'm going to have to graduate to the one that is larger than that as well (I use often)

review/summary: very small and skinny, not worth the money
review/text: I received this item about a week ago. I should say I am disappointed.<br /><br />Like other reviewers had pointed out, the plant was much smaller than advertised on Amazon site. The one I received is very small (about 6 inch), 2 tiny branches and skinny (main truck is less than 2mm), nothing close to the picture they put online.<br /><br />I actually read the complaint reviews before made the order, thought they might just had a bad luck. Oh well, who am I to think that "may the odds just be in my favor"...?<br /><br />I paid $13.98 (incl $6.99 S&H). Not worth the money at all in my opinion

review/summary: Dwarf Pomegranate
review/text: The Dwarf Pomegranate Bansai was shipped very quickly. It was packaged nicely with peanuts/wrapping to ensure the plant was cushioned. However, shipping a plant causes stress as I expected upon ordering. The plant is slightly shriveled and a few dead leaves but it seems to be okay. It also is not the plant as pictured. It is less than a foot tall. Besides the stress and the plant not being the one in the picture I still think this is a great deal for 9.99(plus shipping) and I have faith my bonsai Pomegranate will flourish in the Floridian sun.

review/summary: Very small but maybe strong
review/text: For more than four days, my mail carrier did not deliver my mail but didn't tell me. Amazon's package tracking told me that this plant was delivered to my post office so I know that the plant was at the post office for more than 4 days before I could get it out of its box.<br /><br />It was well packaged in a small pot that was labeled clearly that it was temporary (you should put it in a bigger pot ASAP). There was soil, still damp from a wet paper towel on top, then sealed with plastic tape. The stem and leaves were in a bed of plastic 'pop corn' so it was insulated from bumps and to some extent, changes in temperature.<br /><br />The plant seems to have survived well. No leaves fell off; one leaf was a little yellow on the outer edge which probably meant the soil was too moist.<br /><br />What I am very disappointed with is the plant is about 4 inches tall and only has the primary stem, no other stems at all, not at all nearly as mature as in the picture.<br /><br />UPDATE Aug 4, 2012<br />I planted this little plant in a high-compost mixture and it grew fast. Now, about 5 months later, it's 18 inches tall, well filled-out with branches and is BLOOMING. It has more than 10 blossoms. I hope they turn into fruit. Will update again.

He jumped away from the bowl for some reason - quite funny though!  Keep in mind he's a Persian too so yours might not be as fussy.  The chicken and turkey variety seems to be more palatable for him so if you're looking for a good one with which to start, I'd recommend that one first.  Recommend because of the quality, but be sure of your cat's tastes prior to purchasing because of the price.

This blend however does have a slightly spicy taste<br />to it so if your not into spicy food, keep it in mind. Wish the size was bigger also. If you are family of four or more you will need to make two packs since they<br />are stingy sizes.

review/text: Having spent some time traveling in India and experiencing the unique tastes its foods possess, I can assure anyone who enjoys good food that this sauce is supreme! It is India in a jar!! All too often, we shy away from cooking Indian food, thinking it is too complicated and takes too long. Well, this jar, which can make up to three meals, is ready for immediate use. The spices are from the South of India, known for its exotic and ancient recipes that have been handed down from one master cook to the next. Bringing this tradition right into your home is a wonder. BTW don't try and pass this off as something you threw together, tell your friends that you found Aunty Saro (the white lotus) and her incredible sauce. Good news is to be shared with love!!!

Chip shortbread: If you like shortbread, this will taste decadent! Rich choc. chips. Crispy and yes, also addictive! (Note: only 5 oz instead of 7 oz. box)<br /><br />Butter shortbread: Couldn't really eat these. Too heavy and buttery. Least favorite.<br /><br />Haven't tried others yet.<br /><br />I have a wheat allergy and never tasted shortbread again until I found these wonderful delights at the store in the health-food section! The shortbread choc chip I tried first has not only the unique taste of shortbread, but has chocolate chunks also! They are crunchy and light.<br /><br />In comparison, they weigh less than some other Pamela products. They are not as "buttery" as the Butter Shortbread or Swirl (a good thing in my opinion). I love the pecans also!<br /><br />Recommend to any wheat-allergy sufferer, or gluten intolerant person. :^)

review/text: We eat mostly gluten free as one of my kids has a sensitivity to it. While I try to bake all the goods myself, these looked like a good thing to carry as a snack when we travel. My daughter didn't like the cookie part much. SHe kept trying to pick out just the chocolate chips.<br /><br />For myself, it was OK. Sometimes gluten free baked goods can have a grainy aftertaste and that was the case with these. The upshot was they make an excellent cookie crumb pie crust when you toss them in the food processor and grind them up.

review/summary: delicious by any standards
review/text: I am normally not a cookie person-- I usually find them too sweet and too oily-- but these are just perfect!! They have a texture that reminds me of those Chinese almond cookies (crispy and a bit crumbly rather than chewy). I don't have a wheat or gluten intolerance but these are definitely some of the best cookies I have ever tasted. Best of all, the ingredients are 95% organic.<br /><br />Note: There are 9 cookies in the box. I've eaten 7 in the last couple hours, they're that good!

review/summary: Very Good Organic Gluten-Free Cookies
review/text: I got sent a sample of these organic cookies from the manufacturer and really enjoyed them, so I signed up to get an ongoing monthly delivery of 6 boxes. The problem is, I eat them all within a week so I think I need a second delivery for two weeks later. :) The cookies are crumbly and taste a bit like Mexican Wedding cookies. One thing though, the cookies can come crumbled a bit at times from shipping and the size and amount of chocolate chunks vary greatly from one cookie to the next. I found that is okay though, because they are so tasty. I like dipping them in organic rice milk.

review/summary: Best Product in my pantry
review/text: This is one of the most delicious cookies I have every had! The shortbread is indistinguishable in texture and taste from its regular gluten counterpart. The pecans add a nice crunch in the cookie and the chocolate keeps the whole thing from being too dry.<br />My only wish is that the chocolate was not in there in such big chunks, maybe broken down more to a chip size. So that you get more chocolate through out the cookie and less chocolate in one bite. But that's just a matter of preference. As far as taste the chocolate is excellent, moist and high quality.<br />I love the packaging just as much as the taste. The individual packages are just perfect to pop in my purse to have later as light snack.<br />If you have celiacs, or even if you dont, I highly recommend getting this cookie. It makes a delicious treat.<br /><br />Pros: Taste. Handy packages of 2.<br />Cons: Addictive.

Why in the world she passes the plain ones off as shortbread, when they are at best a bland biscuit, and the base dough for these is as close to shortbread as I've ever had, gluten-free.  They have a great flavor, balance of sweet/savory that makes shortbread so good, nice crisp texture.  I would purchase these again.

review/text: My dog loves these!  We have been giving them to him since the day we brought him home 2 1/2 years ago and he still loves them.  He is picky about what food he will eat and we have had to change brands several times because he just won't eat anymore once he has made up his mind. But, he has never gotten tired of these.  He knows when he is getting a "cookie" he has done something really good, and he is always excited.  They are a great product.  I used to be able to buy them from the "chain" pet store in the area, and I was really bummed when they stopped selling them.  I have been ordering them direct from the manufacturer for well over a year, but I love that Amazon has them now.  I also buy the Mini Paws Peanut Butter Dog Cookies from this company.  We have been using them since day one too, we used them as the training tool since they are tiny.  I can't say enough good things about this product.  Please buy them up and keep them on Amazon.....you won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Precooked was not the way to go...
review/text: I really wanted to love this item. I have ordered from Burgers before. Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.

review/summary: BE CAREFUL - FIND OUT EXPIRATION DATE
review/text: I gave this product 5 stars because as a product it is just the best. BUT, it hasn't been unavailable in stores since this summer. A call to Shelton today confirmed that production is suspended - it will resume -  and that customers should look for the product to be available again in January / February 2011. Any product on the market will probably have a RELATIVELY short expiration date.  It may be long enough for what you need but ask first is what I'm suggesting.

review/summary: Dented Cans
review/text: Of the dozen cans, nine were dented but it doesn't appear from a physical inspection that the seals have been broken.  This is surprising as the lot was delivered plastic-wrapped and in a thick cardboard tray but it may have been associated with horizontal pressure from stacking.  I'm going to use the product with a cautious eye and will toss the lot at the first sign of product inconsistency.

review/summary: Pure, Smooth Taste
review/text: I purchased this particular product because it was the most pure form of powdered coconut milk I could find. I was looking for a healthy alternative to milk cream in my coffee. This mixes up smooth with hot water, and tastes soooo good I drink it from the pitcher before it has had a chance to cool.<br /><br />I would recommend this brand to anyone looking for truly unadulterated pure coconut milk powder.  Short of using pure coconut oil, this is the best.

I generally try to avoid products made with corn syrup, but an infrequent helping of Bosco chocolate syrup is a tasty treat.

review/summary: Best Pretzels.......Tastes Great......Totally Health
review/text: It's not easy eating a whole grain snack these days.  Most whole wheat products are not as healthy as they same.  Many contain saturated fats or corn syrup.  Those marketed as whole wheat often are 50.1% whole wheat, 49.9% white and they are within the law, thanks to food industry lobbying.  Truly 100% whole wheat snacks that taste great are a rarity.  This is one of them.  I'm not just a healthy snack addict, I'm also a doctor.....this is good as long as you don't have an issue with sodium.

review/summary: Very good, although a little salty
review/text: I have always wondered why it is so difficult to get decent whole grain pretzels.  Even most of the ones made with whole wheat flour are usually "honey wheat", and are loaded up with all sorts of crap.  If I wanted desert, I would get them covered with chocolate.  When I want a savory, crunchy bite, my snack of choice is something that actually tastes like a pretzel.  These do, with an added flavor of sesame seeds.  These may be the best whole grain pretzels I have tried, and I highly recommend them.  My only two caveats are 1) don't get these if you don't like sesame seeds, and 2) they have a pronounced saltieness.  I don't mind the saltieness, but I also wouldn't minds just a tad less.

review/text: I purchased these pretzels for our small natural foods store.  They were an instant hit.  The flavor is really nice - not too salty, and the sesame seeds are a nice touch.  And 100% whole-wheat?  Where can you find a nutritious snack like that?  Personally I don't snack, but I have been known to grab a bag of these along with a piece of fruit for a light supper if I'm in a rush. I will definitely be reordering these.
