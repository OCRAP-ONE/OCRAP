review/summary: Raspberry chipotle vinaigrette
review/text: One of the fastfood sandwich chains has a raspberry chipotle salad dressing that's pretty good, so I went looking for something similar. This product got lots of rave reviews on the Internet, so I thought that I'd take a chance.<br /><br />The verdict? I'm glad I took a chance. This dressing, which is low in fat but high in flavor, is an absolute winner. I even keep a bottle at the office for those eat-at-my-desk lunches. The combination of sweet and bold is outstanding.

review/summary: The best Vinaigrette I've ever had in my life!
review/text: This is the stuff salads were made for! So yummy.  I put lots of goodies in my salad - chicken, walnuts, green onions, tomatoes and on and on, and then top it with this, and it's a salad made in heaven! The ONLY down side to this vinaigrette is that it's pricey, but oh sooo good and so worth it.  I eat a lot of salads and so I can't use it each time I make one, but for those special salads and for company, this is what comes out! A perfect balance of sweet raspberries and balsamic vinegar, it's a home run! Would be a perfect item for a gift basket as well!

review/text: I had a salad in a restaurant for lunch and went crazy over the  roasted raspberry chipotle vinaigrette dressing. I decided  to recreate the salad myself at home. The salad dressing I found in my search on the internet was the Fischer & Wieser  Roasted Raspberry chipotle vinaigrette dressing. It is absolutely fabulous! I have made the salad  many times and for friends and have had to order extra bottles since I got them hooked on it too. This salad dressing will not disappoint and  deserves a five star review!

review/summary: Tasty gummies!
review/text: These are soooo good!  They are a bit larger than regular bagged gummi bears.  I can also confirm what the other person said about being "mushy," but I much prefer the texture of these to the regular gummies.  I would describe them as softer and tender.  But if you like the harder, more chewy version, you might not like these.<br /><br />I read in another spot someone complaining because they are yellowish instead of clear like they seem in the picture.  They are indeed slightly yellow (very pale) and not clear. So, if you are buying them as a decoration, beware!<br /><br />The only problem I have with them is not eating the entire bag in one sitting.

review/summary: Little Teeny Noodles but Great Big Taste!
review/text: I was very surprised when I prepared this for the first time. The pasta looks really large on the package illustration, but is actually very tiny, almost Spaghetti-Os size.  I wouldn't serve this at a dinner party, but it makes fun eating for lunch, a snack, or a side dish.<br /><br />All the Knorr-Lipton noodle dishes are quick and easy, though some are kind of boring in the flavor department. This one is really full-bodied. If you have used the Knorr Parma Rosa sauce mix, this is pretty much the same flavor: cheese, tomato and garlic. If you have kids that like garlic, this should go over really well.

review/text: I started buying Lipton Noodles & Sauce years ago, and find it to be a very reliable, tasty product.  When Lipton first started making Noodles & Sauce, the product I purchased then was Tomato Basil Noodles (made with shells); actually a far better product!  They have since changed them to the Tomato Parmesan, which is good, but not as good....One trick to try if you remember & love the original Tomato Basil is to use all water instead of milk-it makes the flavor more like the old style :) Many of the other flavors are big hit with my children as well.

The deep green luster of the leaves is beyond compare, and the plant is loaded with buds ready to bloom!  I have had the plant for four days, and already four fragrant and lovely flowers have opened and are just lovely!  The wicker basket is a perfect accent to this plant.  It is arrived well cared for and beautifully potted.  It responds well to morning (soft) sunlight, moist but not soaking wet soil, and seems to thrive on morning and evening misting!  I will be buying more of these plants from this seller for Mother's Day and House-warming gifts to share this pretty smelling masterpiece (I am NOT giving mine away - although I have been asked several times already since it first arrived!!).  I would suggest this plant and this seller again and again!!  I did have one SMALL problem - the wicker basket was unraveling at the bottom.  I contacted the seller, and they replaced it RIGHT away - no questions asked and extremely apologetic for the 'problem'.  Great product, great customer service!

review/text: I needed a gift for my mother on short notice.  I called the windox to see exactly what time frame I was looking at for delivery.  They were so friendly & helpful and took patience with care to answer all my questions.  I spoke w/ several people, one for delivery (it got there the next day), someone for plant questions, i was told it was beautiful w lots of buds, & someone to make sure they had my order & it was going out the door.  My mother loved it,said it was stunning, she has to touch it to make sure it was real.  Fabulous! Thank u WIndowbox.<br /><br />Just an UPdate:  My mother still loves her plant.  She said she takes care of it per instructions.  She has had it almost a month, she said the blooms were endless.  Just a few days ago we were talking on the phone, and she was commenting on it, and while we were talking she counted 15 blooms and she said maybe a dozen more in a week or so.  I am so pleased, it was worth every penny and she just loves it.

review/text: I was quite a bit nervous about ordering a live plant for a gift from online. But as I live in Europe and wanted my Mother to have a lovely Gardenia that would bloom because she loves the fragrance I had little choice.  I went with this one based on the mostly good reviews.  While it's a trifle overpriced compared to what you could get at your local big box home store, again I live in Europe, so not an option.  At $40 this is very competitively priced compared to other offerings on the web.  Most importantly though my Mother is thrilled with this plant.  It arrived in good time, well packaged with flowers on it, and LOTS of buds for flowers to come.  I am very pleased, my Mother is as well, and I would highly recommend this product from Windowbox.

After the plant acclimates, then tempertures between 70 and 85 F would be best (from spring to fall). These plants can handle down to 45 F ...which means it must come indoors here up north for the winter.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Mocafe Vanilla Chai
review/text: I love chai tea; however, finding a product that is the "best" has been a task. After trying the regular MOCAFE Precious Divinity Chai some years ago [purchased from TJ Maxx], I found it to be very good, but missing something. Since buying an espresso maker, I started adding some Torani syrup to give it a vanilla flavor. So, I decided to buy the MOCAFE Vanilla Chai to eliminate the syrup.<br /><br />I will agree with the the other review about the powder being sweeter, but I think it is well balanced when using steamed milk and froth the top. When frothing the milk [skinny], the drink is a sweet, creamy vanilla chai drink. I haven't drank a better chai powder up to this point.

review/summary: Riding the Fence...
review/text: ...recently had Colavita Whole Wheat Spaghetti at a friend's home and I liked it. Considering it a healthier addition to my meal plans I came home to see if Amazon had it at a decent price with FREE SHIPPING. I was lucky to find a wide range of pricing choices from different sellers BUT the shipping charges negated any savings. Luckily this purchase was an Amazon super-sale item, I'm not sure when these 20 bags are gone I'll purchase again unless there is a sale of some sort.<br /><br />Having grown up on the East Coast eating lots of pasta in many shapes and sizes, the sauce ingredients always took precedence over the pasta. Spices, meats and veggies were the premium items and the pasta was the vehicle for the ride. So moving toward paying a premium for pasta is a new experiment. The Colavita Whole Wheat Spaghetti is good, I'm not sure better than freshly made when available at comparable price, so I'm riding the fence.

review/summary: Yogi Green Tea is the Best!
review/text: My husband and I love this tea.  We drink several cups a day of this and Yogi Green Tea Energy.  I start each day with Yogi Green Tea Energy. I find it is a wonderful way to wake up and help me think clearly in the morning (and throughout the day).  Drinking the Pure Green tea has also had a beneficial effect in reducing the knee pain I was having. I had read that drinking green tea could be beneficial in helping build strong bones and reducing arthritic pain, so I looked for a tea that was organic and chose this brand.  After about 2 weeks of drinking 2-3 cups a day I discovered I could easily walk up stairs without knee pain.  This was the only change I had made in my diet.  My chiropractor was amazed!  I truly believe this is a greatly beneficial tea and the added bonus is that it is great tasting!

review/summary: Recommended with orange slices
review/text: For purposes of this review, I made a cup of Yogi Green Tea (Pure Green 16 Count Box) and now present my findings.  I used Chrystal Springs Distilled Water, which I brought to a rapid boil and then poured over the tea bag in a medium sized mug.  I dunked the tea bag ten times and then covered the mug with a plate for the three minutes recommended on the tea box.<br /><br />The freshly brewed tea has a faint, grassy smell.  The taste is mild, with a slightly bitter after taste.  The taste reminds me of the green tea served in Chinese restaurants.<br /><br />Next I brewed another cup of the Yogi Green Tea, added a teaspoon of orange blossom honey, and two slices of a honey-bell orange.  This is a delightful beverage.  The mild green tea allows for the full flavor of the honey and orange slices to be experienced.  This last cup of tea is the one I recommend.

review/text: Did I get a bad batch?  People here seemed to rate it so highly?  Very bland taste for me.  Strangely enough, whatever aroma is there almost more of chamomile or peppermint than actual tea.  Yes I tried a few different times -- steeping longer, less water, different temperatures.  Does a better job at replicating the color of tea than the flavor.  Don't know what else to say.

review/summary: Sheldon's favorite!
review/text: We were having a terrible time finding a food that our little shihtzu, Sheldon liked and liked him back.  I tried a few of the Castor & Pollux foods and he loved them all!  Plus, there wasn't any adjustment time with his system.  Within 2 days he was eating it completely without any digestion problems.  I have found that to be true with finding pets the food that agrees with them...if it does, it does quickly and if it doesn't, it never will.  At least that has been my experience.  This one and the turkey vegetable flavor are a firmer consistency that make it easier for me to cut up and for him to eat.  I tried Wellness and Natural Balance as well as Nature's Variety Instinct and Blue Buffalo and none of those agreed with him and even a small amount (a tablespoon) added to his regular food made his stool soft.  Not so with these foods.  I have talked with Debra Guenther at Castor & Pollux too and the company has excellent customer service.  This is a keeper in his rotation.

I was very impressed and you will be too!<br /><br />The filters are solid and I have not noticed any filters breaking.  I have even tried to damage these and make coffee and surprisingly I found they withstood the damage better than regular paper filters!  As for the taste I find that there is a small improvement in taste, but that might also be caused by the special Melitta style of filter (small pips throughout the filter that increase the filter surface area).<br /><br />When it comes to a name brand like Melitta's, you really cannot go wrong.  I am very happy with these filters and I am certain you will be happy as well!

Amazon was out of stock on the regular paper filters, so I crossed my fingers, and tried these instead.  I was immediately impressed by their performance, and received not a single complaint from the dozen or so fussy coffee-drinkers in our little club.  I have since purchased two more of the six-packs for the coffeemaker here at the office.  We easily brew 6 pots a day in our Krups dual-carafe machine, and have never had a problem.<br /><br />They work just like the "real" thing, and are made of sustainable fibers.  These *are* the filters you are looking for.

review/summary: Avoid
review/text: I bought these thinking that using bamboo was a great idea as it's highly renewable.  But these filters do not do a good job at keeping the grounds in the filter, which obviously is all important.  I tried using these four separate times and each time the filter leaked at the seam.  And it wasn't just the seam splitting.  They actually deteriorated at the seam's edges.  The combination of bamboo and paper pulp does not seem to be able to withstand the flow of hot water.  I use a pour-over method when making coffee, and I never have a problem with paper filters, so I'm confident that it's not what I'm doing.  It's the composition of the filters.  Maybe I got a bum batch, but maybe not.  I won't be using the 76 filters that I have left.  It's back to all paper for me.

review/text: I bought this product due to its eco friendly paper.  Big time coffee drinker so I could be a big source of deforestation if I don't watch it.  It does the job it is intended to do.  Have to say I noticed some crumpling at top edges that I need to smooth before brewing.  A few times coffee has leaked over the sides of the filter resulting in grounds getting in the pour and leaking.  Making sure the paper is open all the way and smooth around the top edges has taken care of the problem.  Can recommend bamboo based paper vs white chemically treated paper!

review/summary: Super seasoning for plenty of different foods.
review/text: Don't be fooled by the simple packaging of this mixed spice. This is not a simple flavor.<br /><br />If you like the steaks served at a certain "Australian" styled steak house you may well like this seasoning. A friend of mine introduced it to me at a little cook out, where he rubbed a generous amount on some new york strip cuts and grilled, and I fell in love. He then told me that this was the above mentioned steak house's secret seasoning for it's steaks, him claiming to know this by having worked their for a time. I know he had worked at just about every chain restaurant at some point, but that's about all I can confirm in regards to this rumor one way or the other as I've never had a steak there, nor worked at one. Regardless of the truthfullness of that statement, I can firmly attest to fact that this is an excellent mixed spice.<br /><br />I've used it on just about every type of meat except sea food, though I suspect it would be good on that too, with a noteable preformance on eggs. It is mildly spicey and fairly salty, but not overpowering unless you really load up.<br /><br />Reminds me of cajun seasonings in simular packaging, but is not as "hot". I highly recommend a good cut of beef, pan fried in olive oil with a generous amount of Cavender's Greek Seasoning rubbed in.<br /><br />It is also priced very well, and one container is more then enough to last a while. If you for some reason don't love it, you won't be out very much money and if you end up loving it as much as I do, you'll have plenty of it to last you a long time. A seasoning every kitchen should have!

review/text: You can create your own secret recipe with this seasoning and make people think you are a true grilling champ.  Wonderful flavor and just the right amount of spice on grilled chicken.  I ordered from the company because I could no longer find this product at my local grocery store.  I was absolutely amazed at how quickly the company shipped my package.  Won't hesitate to order from them again!

review/summary: A secret, yet delicate, ingredient
review/text: This spice blend is very useful in all sorts of situations, not many of them "Greek."  It is easily added to steak, chicken, spaghetti sauce, burgers, etc.  I've used it when I did not have pepper.  I've used it when I did not have garlic (in fact, it has both).  It is never a terribly overpowering blend, which is why it can be used anywhere, and (for some reason) wherever it is used, it seems to yield success.  It's very cheap, so it is advisable to keep it around...it's advisable to keep it around anyway, since it will do you wonders, when you are in a bind.  This is an ideal product.

Yes, you heard me.<br /><br />Anyway, I've used Cavenders for years and its my secret weapon for boiled shrimp and also<br />Low Country Boils. Its great on steaks and pork, and also perks up any green veggies. It<br />does contain salt so if you're sensitive to that then be judicious with its use.<br /><br />This is the original and its still the best from all the copycats out there from Konriko<br />and others.

review/text: I started using this years ago when it was in the condiment section of our health food stores. Having had Indian mixed pickle, lime and mango pickle in India, I was happy to find this in the states. My favorite by far is this Chili Pickle, now called relish. I add it to lots of quick meals for a taste treat. At some point the stores gradually stopped selling it and I assumed others did not share the delight (we have found it in Indian groceries in large city areas).  Anyway, even as my mouth waters in anticipation, I am grateful for the internet for helping me find a way to bring it home.

review/summary: Addictive, perks up dull dishes, not just for Indian food
review/text: Simple ingredients combine for a mouth-watering, spicy condiment that I keep finding more and more excuses to use.<br /><br />This is not just for Indian food. In fact, I don't eat a lot of Indian food. But I find myself putting it on pasta, Mexican dishes, salads, stir fries, fried rice, pizza, anything with tofu, vegetables, omelettes, etc.<br /><br />I'm a vegetarian these days, but I literally salivate remembering what it tasted like on a turkey sub. Luckily for me, this condiment also makes it easier to remain a vegetarian.<br /><br />The ingredients are simple -- Chile Peppers, Canola Oil, Salt, Ginger, Mustard, Fenugreek, Spices, Acetic Acid, Citric Acid -- but the blend is perfect. The heat isn't overbearing and there's no unwanted sugary taste, which ruins so many relishes for me.<br /><br />Everyone's tastes are different, but you should give it a try.<br /><br />I'm so happy I've found Patak's Chile Relish.

review/text: We were introduced to Robby's pancake mix by a friend several years ago.  Of all the many prepared and scratch mixes we have tried in the past, Robby's is by far the best we have ever had.  Although when prepared with milk Robby's tastes excellent, it is by far better when prepared with buttermilk! We use the same Robby's mix (prepared with buttermilk, of course) for waffles with the same wonderful taste experience.  You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: I just tried this mix for the first time today, as it took awhile for me to remember to buy buttermilk. It's quite tasty, but you can really taste the salt! I made it on my Villaware Belgian wafflemaker on setting 6, using 1/8 cup butter and 1/8 cup oil (recipe calls for 1/4 oil), and it came out dark-brown and crispy on outside and very moist on the inside - just delicious. Using two cups of the mix, I got about 5 waffles.<br /><br />I've also purchased the Carbon's Golden Malted waffle mix, which I've like, but I prefer Robby's because it's so much more flavorful - perhaps I should try buttermilk with the Golden Malted as well. The downside is Robby's calls for 1/4 cup of oil, while Golden Malted requires 2 tbs of butter - so if you're looking for something lower fat, you may want to look at the Golden Malted. By the way, I was surprised to see that the folks who make Carbon's Golden Malted make the Robby's mix as well.<br /><br />Tip: You can freeze buttermilk (just measure the correct amount and put in ziplock bags for the next go-around) to avoid wasting the leftover buttermilk....

review/summary: Not what we expected in taste.
review/text: When we tried Carbons Malted Pancake and Waffle mix, we were pleasantly surprised. The waffles are great, crisp and tasty just like the reviews stated. We always keep the waffle mix in stock. We tried making pancakes with the waffle mix and didn't like the results.<br /><br />That led us to try Robby's buttermilk pancake mix. What a disappointment. Now it could be us as we are used to Aunt Jemima and those are hard to beat. Robby's was definitely saltier, flat and had a strange taste. They seemed to be oily too, which the 1/4 cup of oil might be the cause I guess. We used real buttermilk but milk can be substituted. On the can, it's not recommended.<br /><br />I wouldn't steer anyone away from giving Robby's a try but I wouldn't order a 3-pack just in case.

review/text: This makes really very good pancakes.  It is a favorite of my youngest son who currently lives in Tokyo.  Now, I either have to ship it to him, or he takes some home with him when he comes to the US in the summer or for Christmas.  It would be nice if Amazon could ship this to Tokyo for me.<br />One of my daughters  has a very good recipe to make pancakes from scratch but I haven't yet  persuaded her to share it with me.  However in any event it is probably more time consuming and would not beat having the ingredients already mixed except for the egg, oil and buttermilk that one adds to this product.  I try to avoid using low fat buttermilk but nowadays all you often can find is those tasteless low fat or no fat products that serve to increase your appetite.  No wonder we are turning into an obese society.

review/summary: It's true pancake house flavor
review/text: After trying unsuccessfully to buy commercial mixes from pancake houses whose pancakes were superb, I tracked down the miller of Robby's mix who originally sold only to institutional customers. I bought directly from the miller in bulk until they decided to outsource their direct-buyers to worldpantry.com who now sells Robby's for more $. That's when I started buying from Amazon for less.<br /><br />Be careful not to over-mix the batter. It's better to FOLD the dry ingredients gently into the liquid ingredients rather than mix vigorously -- it's ok to leave small pockets of undissolved solids. Then let it sit for at least 15 minutes to allow the reaction of the ingredients to generate bubbles. Resist breaking the bubbles and dissolving every small pocket of powdery mix. Leave some lumps.This will ensure a light fluffy pancake.<br /><br />Breaking all the bubbles and dissolving all the solids completely, so that the batter is completely smooth like frosting, will cause thin, heavy pancakes.<br /><br />To the 3 out of 16 people who hated the taste, all I can say is that you may have developed a taste for blander, less authentic batters in childhood, which has become your standard. There's nothing wrong with that, any more than those who grew up on Vermont Maid imitation maple syrup who still prefer it to pure 100% maple syrup.<br /><br />But for those who know and appreciate the more complex flavor profile of the real deal (a bit salty, light and fluffy with a buttermilk tang, a bit yeasty), then Robby's will probably exceed your expectations.<br /><br />I noticed that some are reporting good results using the mix for waffles. Years ago, I asked the miller why it's not called "pancake and waffle mix." His answer: "We don't recommend it for waffles. It's a pancake mix."
