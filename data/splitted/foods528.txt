review/summary: Allergies Begone!
review/text: So far, this is one of only 3 dog food brands that I've found that my Border collie and adopted Australian Shepherd do well on. They used to itch and shed a lot until I switched to this food. Our australian shepherd had pink around his mouth and on his belly before switching. It has limited ingredients, less chance of food alergies. I have tried many high cost and probably high quality foods but nothing worked. I ended up having the best luck with this and with Purina one smartblend of all foods. I know, I know, that's not what you read when you research the internet but my dogs do best on Purina or this California brand.

review/summary: Relaxing aroma..
review/text: The strong flavor and scent of jasmine enhances this tea. I'm not sure how else to explain this but this tea generates a calm atmosphere when I drink it. The Jasmine aroma has a powerful, almost overwhelming after taste once you sip it. Initially you have to get use to it but once you do its addictive. I sometimes add some honey for a little sweetness. Give it a shot you will love it.

review/text: I ordered this tea knowing that it was sourced in Thailand. I thought I would just have to accept that it wasn't as good as the normal Japanese one that I get at the corner deli.<br /><br />However, I received a shipment about a week or two ago and to my delight found that the tea is once again from Japan! I'm drinking it now and the difference in quality is amazing! The one from Japan is so much better!<br /><br />THANK YOU AMAZON! You have made my day!

review/summary: Ito En Jasmine Japanese Green Tea
review/text: This is made in Thailand and does not taste the same. The old made in Japan drinks are totally superior in taste, after taste, aroma. Didn't listen to the other reviewer about the formula change with the made in Thailand drinks and ordered 2 cases but didn't want to go through the trouble of returning. If you had tasted the old drink, you will greatly be disappointed. If you have not had Ito En before, you may still find this drink good. Sorry, not for me.<br /><br />Update 7/14/12:<br />I saw a comment from other buyer that he/she received a Japan made batch. I went ahead and ordered 2 cases. Sure enough, they are now Made in Japan. The interesting thing is this batch tasted "watered down", exactly like another reviewer said!!! I now understand what he/she meant. Bottom line: there is definitely some quality consistency issue here (at least post Tsunami time). It is batch dependent, facility dependent ( have seen Thailand made, Japan Made, and have seen comments about Hawaii Made!). Good luck to all who seek good tea. I have switched to brewing my own tea and bought the tea from Eto En directly.

review/summary: Best tea there is, love the jasmin
review/text: I see two reviews saying this is made in Thailand.  I would like to know why people think this since it only says Hawaii on the bottles.  Could someone please let me know why people are saying this is made in Thailand?<br />On the first page of the Ito-En website it says it is imported from Japan.<br /><br />I find this to be the most delicious refreshing tea there is.  It is like drinking the delicate juice of the jasmin flower.  Jasmin is the most often used natural fragrance essence ingredient in perfumes.  The flower has a scent that carries far and is what heaven must smell like.<br /><br />You wouldn't ordinarily think that a tea flavored with flowers would be good but this is delicious.  It does say on the list of ingredients that real jasmin is used.<br /><br />I have been getting this at Whole Foods and paying almost two dollars a bottle for it.  I have no problem downing two bottles of this a day.  I checked the bottles from Whole Foods and they say Hawaii, no mention of Thailand, so I'm not sure exactly where this is actually made or if Hawaii is simply the import area, or it is actually made there.  But it's no problem as it is delicious and hasn't killed me yet so I am purchasing a case here to save money.  I also signed up for automatic delivery.  The only problem is I need more than twelve bottles a month.<br /><br />If I knew for sure it was made in Thailand I would still get it.<br />I'm not suffering any ill effects after drinking two bottles a day for the past month.

review/text: I highly reccomend his tea. Stick it in the refrigerator and grab it to go.<br />I read the two negative reviews on this..why  the bad reviews I have no idea but if your some Japanese aficionado then stick your nose high and walk away. ,. This tea is authentically delicious as stated by some snobby Japanese tea drinker friends...this tea has a fragrant jasmine flavor that is delicate yet powerful. The green tea has a nice kick to it so gets you calmed yet energized<br /><br />Perfect for everything from a nice summer picnic to eating tamales with<br /><br />I have this on the subscribe and save ship plan and find that it is  perfect to get every month.<br /><br />Now I wish that amazon would just offer TJ's kombucha for that too. I would be set then<br /><br />JUST A NOTE HERE,,,,, Ito en offers the tea in a different  square bottle which is cheaper, I don't think that is the same formula as I did test them both  back to back. The one in the teas tea square bottle  is probably more akin to a watered down American version that caters to the McDonald junk food culture. What does that mean, you  ask? Well it means many people In the us have watered down Taste for things and  wouldn't want a nice fragrant jasmine in their tea, just sayin. But it's ok if you don't eat mcDd and still like a softer version.

review/summary: Can't get over the texture.
review/text: I ignored the bad reviews because, really, I can eat and enjoy just about anything.<br /><br />The fish smell is pretty unpleasant, but the bulk of it does rinse away. There continues to be an unpleasant smell after, that's no longer fishy, but its there and impossible to get over with the horrible texture essentially forcing your mind to never get over the fact that you're eating something that's not quite right.<br /><br />Someone described these as bad calamari, which I find inaccurate because bad calamari still passes as food in my book. These feel artificial. It doesn't taste bad, but it feels like you are chewing on rubber bands, the noodle just will not break down. Ultimately, your natural reflexes take over and you just can't swallow a mouthful of rubber bands.<br /><br />I'm trying to find redeeming qualities about this to pull the score up to 2 stars at least, but I just can't. Sure, it works as a flavor carryng mechanism, but so do rubber bands.

review/summary: Got Fish?
review/text: These come packed in a bag of what I can only assume is fish juice. To put it simply, they reek of fish. Rinsing them off and boiling them only helps to some extent; you're going to need to drown them in something strong if you don't like your noodles to smell like week-old carp. Once you get past the smell, they are a reasonable replacement for noodles, though they are more chewy than the real thing and they have sort of a tangy aftertaste. They might be okay in an oriental dish, but they were ghastly by themselves (I tired both fettuccini and red meat sauce).

review/summary: Miracle Noodle - A bit overrated!
review/text: I guess it boils down to one's taste buds or the outright need to have pasta in your diet, both I can live without thanks to cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli...all which I shred to appear like either rice or "broccoli slaw" or eat my spaghetti sauce or whatever other sauce with other ingredients without pasta.  I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetic four months ago and despite taking insulin I couldn't get my blood sugar under control; I made the switch to LCHF and  less than a month later reduced my insulin by half and again by half and today I manage my diabetes without any insulin, pill or injection.  A reviewer used the analogy of eating rubber bands and another, cartilage and both are right.  I remember someone recommending me Dreamfield's pasta...except it tasted pretty darn good but falsely advertised it's product; it was no different than Ronzoni's Smart Taste which I allow myself to eat about once a month as a splurge treat.  I gave up long ago thinking this sort of stuff is low carb heaven and accepted it was better to retool my recipes then to allow myself to believe I couldn't live without starch; come to find out, I can.

review/summary: No. Just no.
review/text: This was a horrifying experience. I was really excited to see the noodles advertised on one of my favorite "deal" sites, and when the cost of noodles averaged out to about a dollar per package, including shipping, I decided to purchase them. I did some research on Wikipedia to make sure I wasn't secretly purchasing poison, but I should have done further research to understand what I was really buying.<br /><br />First off, these noodles smell like fish. Like nasty fish. They are packaged in water in what has got to be the most unappetizing presentation ever. The texture is disgusting and the noodles are this creepy, pure white. Do we have any Doctor Who fans here? Do you remember when the Tenth Doctor has opened up a Cyberman and those white cyber-innards come out? THAT IS WHAT THESE NOODLES ARE. Seriously, Google "Doctor Cyberman innards" and the first picture is of The Doctor getting ready to embark on what he doesn't yet realize will be the most depressing meal of his life.<br /><br />You can't even call them noodles.<br /><br />I tried. I really did. I washed them (ugh) and boiled them and sprinkled seasonings and alfredo sauce and shrimp. The noodles still smelled like fish, but I pressed onwards. I ate about two bites and threw the noodles out, then I went and threw out all the other packages of noodles that I had just spent about $30 on. That is how nasty these things are.

review/summary: If you enjoy rice noodles, can tolerate jellyfish noodles, and asian food - these are fantastic!
review/text: I just discovered these while looking for low carb snacks.<br /><br />I am so happy I did!<br /><br />First, if you are looking to eat these with red marinara sauce and meatballs, I wouldn't recommend it. I am not saying don't do it (I haven't tried it yet either), but the texture and flavor or these really isn't suitable for that.<br /><br />I eat mine with butter, salt, Parmesan cheese, and garlic.<br /><br />Basically if you ever ate jelly fish noodles and liked them you will like this too. If didn't like them, well, you may still like them because they are NOT fishy or crunchy (like some review say). I really don't see how anyone can call these "fishy." I even forgot to rinse them once and didn't mind.<br /><br />However, if you like rice noodles you will pleasantly surprised. They have the slightly slimy, slightly "Crunchy" (has a bite to it, but really crunchy but not swishy like regular pasta) that rice noodles have. That being said, these will be FANTASTIC in pad thai.<br /><br />The noodles absorb flavors wonderfully and cook really fast. They taste great too. My only complaint is that the bags are a bit small and they are somewhat pricey. But if you are craving noodles or starches they work. I've eaten them more than once as a "late night binge food."<br /><br />They do make a great substitute for carbs and starches (NOT a substitute for a "meat" as one reviewer said) and they are quite satisfying.

Still way to much sodium there, but I was just testing them out. They were just ok. I could tell they weren't real noodles. It was a texture thing. I haven't given up on them though. I still plan on trying some of the recipes out from the web site. I also plan to try some of my own recipes out using them in place of other types of noodles. Slightly expensive at Two dollars average for a seven ounce bag. But what diet food is cheap? I even decided to buy the rice noodles and want to give them a try as well.

The only problem I had was that the nutritional information on the package was incomplete.  I contacted Miracle and they provided.  There are approximately 2 servings per package with 1.5 grams of fiber per serving....and as the package says no other calories.<br /><br />I can't have pasta - Blood sugar problem - so for me this Noodle is perfect.  I give it 5 stars in spite of the nutritional information shortcomings...they were easy enough to obtain from Miracle.

review/text: I think these noodles are the best discovery ever!!!!  Yes, when you open it, they do smell fishy, HOWEVER, when you eat, no fishy taste at all.  I am doing the Ideal Protein Diet which has a lot of limitations and if I didn't discover these noodles to eat, it would have not been easy to stay on this diet.  The best way I found to make these noodles is stir fried with veggies.  The more water you can remove with paper towels, the better they taste IMO.  Great product that I wish I can get locally.  I find myself ordering these noodles every other week.  My picky 12 year old son who is on a gluten free diet thinks they are great too.  I make a marinara sauce with shrimp and throw over noodles and he loves it.  Great product!

review/summary: Best replacement for Asian noodle dishes for low carb dieting.
review/text: This product and all other variations of this is a god send for people on a low carb diet and given up eating regular Asian style noodles. The key word here is Asian. This noodle won't replace those who want it as a sub for American or Italian style dishes. It's not made for it and wont work. Besides buying it here, the only other places that carry this type of "noodle" are in Asian markets. That should tell you that it's only a good replacement for Asian style noodles.<br /><br />This goes great with any stir fry, cold mixed, pad thai, or Pho style broth.<br /><br />It's super easy to prepare, just drain, wash it in cold water, blanch it in hot water and it's ready for use.<br /><br />These noodles are tasteless on their own so you need to add flavor to it. Cold mix it with sesame oil, soy sauce, scallions, some veggies and mix in the noodles, or add some peanut sauce. I haven't had any smelly issues as these noodles absorb the smell of the dish you cook it with.<br /><br />They have a chewy consistency but not to the extreme of calamari. To make it less chewy, leave it in the wok a little longer.

The "noodles" are gelatinous like clear rubber bands (fettucini).  After eating I al so find not satisfying at all and I still want something to eat.  They are also EXPENSIVE.  Basically you're buying a cup of cooked "noodles".  Too good to be sure? yes. I agree with the other reviewer;  eat the regular noodles and ride your bike more.

review/summary: Not for everyone, especially me.
review/text: Let me start by saying that these ARE NOTHING LIKE NOODLES! While they have the shape of them they taste nothing like it. I was all for adding something to my HCG diet that would help with keeping me full but I could NOT get past the texture of the "noodles".<br /><br />If you are an adventurous person who doesn't have texture issues, then these might be for you. My husband will have to eat the rest of the 5 packages (and he will eat anything) and he agrees that they are weird and sort of have the texture of squid.  I even followed the directions to a T but still couldn't get rid of the "fishy" smell.  I even tried holding my breath while I chewed but I couldn't past the issue of what they feel like in my mouth. And I swear I could feel what I swallowed, sticking around in my throat. It took hours for the sensation to go away.

review/summary: best of the miracle noodles
review/text: I have now tried all the miracle noodles and have found these to be best. The consistency is closer to a chewy rice noodle, which I like and they are great with saut&eacute;ed veggies! The angle-hair is also good, but the rice is really gross consistency. I cant say I dont miss traditional noodles still but these are fabulous to cut those carbs and still fill a bowl with more than just vegetables.

LOTS of bacon. then add my favorite garlic, ginger, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes, whatever vegetables I have in my fridge..<br />Add them all together, cook until tender, add a whole pkg of noodles and then shut off the fire.<br />Throw in a large handful of fresh spinach and let wilt.  Throw in some hot chili paste and Ta-Da!!!<br />Nothing else needed..<br />You don't even need cheese!<br /><br />I have not found any other substitute that allows me my favorite pasta dishes without Gluten..<br />Now I can have my pasta and eat it, too!<br /><br />Cheap, easy, they absorb whatever flavors you're cooking with, and the best part?

review/text: I am SOOOOOOOO happy to have found these noodles!!! I've been calorie counting and these noodles have allowed me to more easily stay in my 1200 calorie daily limit....and also be gluten free! Prior to discovering these, I had taken pasta totally out of my diet. They're also so easy to prepare. For soups, Stir Fry's, etc....these are a wonderful replacement. And...I even put spaghetti sauce over them, etc....as well.....just be sure to do the last step, with the paper towel, before using them in that way or they'll be too watery.

review/summary: Definitely weird, but very filling and 0 calories!
review/text: There is definitely a trick to these and it took me a bit before I could really figure out how to properly prepare these. When they come out of the package they have a strange almost silicone smell and a rubbery texture. I dump them directly into a colander and run hot water over them for about 30 to 50 seconds while agitating them with my hands. After this I let them dry and sometimes even blot them with a paper towel a bit otherwise the sauce just slides off. Then I dump my favorite pasta sauce on there and I'm good to go! Not the real thing but still a very satisfying zero calorie replacement!

review/summary: Perhaps not a 'miracle', but close enough for me!
review/text: If you are looking for a pasta replacement that has the exact texture and flavor of white-flour pasta, you are barking up the wrong tree. If you are looking for a reasonable replacement for high calorie pasta dishes I think this fits the bill. First, when you open the bag there IS a definite 'fish' smell...which completely goes away when you rinse the noodles under some water. I used alfredo sauce and all I could taste was the flavor of the sauce. Second, the texture is definitely more 'rubbery' than traditional pasta...it kind of reminds me of squid tentacles. This was a bit off-putting for the first couple of bites, but by the end of the meal I was already pretty much used to the texture...I personally prefer this texture to the 'grainy' texture of whole wheat pasta, which is not even that much healthier than white flour pasta. I think after eating it a few times I won't even notice the odd texture. For me the trade-off is worth it...a bit of a texture issue for no calorie, no carb pasta? I'll take it!!

review/text: These take a bit of work; rise them off, then boil for a bit, then try to dry them off, then fry them till squeeky, then add them to your item you're making.  Good luck trying to cut them.  They have no taste so works well in stir fry, or soup, or even spagetti sauce.  I am used to dry noodles; these are slippery and wet when you take them out of the package.  I'm not impressed.

review/summary: You'd be surprised they are worth the try.
review/text: The texture might seem chewy and strange at first, but it's because inevitably you compare it to traditional pasta.  If you had never tried pasta, I'm sure you'd say it tastes great, and it does.  I mean, it doesn't really have a taste but it absorbs the taste of the sauce or the ingredientes you add.  I prepared the shirataki mixed with chichen and other vegetables and even with butter, herbs and spices; and I loved it.  I also had a psychological satisfaction too, knowing I was cutting down on a lot of calories and adding more fiber to my diet.  It's definitely more expensive to eat these noodles than regular pasta, but not for much.

review/summary: Too expensive
review/text: I canceled my ship and save on this item.  The package costs more than the local grocery store, per item.  And it's smaller in weight than the local store's product.  I was also surprised that the noodles are clear.  But in the picture, they do look clear.  The local product contains tofu to give it a more noodle-like look (and more calories).<br /><br />So all of that to the side, I do think this flavor of shirataki noodles are less smelly than other varieties I've tried.  And they taste like the others, which pretty much means no taste.  But they do give you somewhat the experience of eating a noodle while really saving on calories.  As with all shirataki noodles, they're a tad bit slimey and can be a little bit hard to eat at first.<br /><br />To use this product, I rinse it very well in a collander, trying not to smell it as it comes out of the package.  Then I heat them in the microwave 2-3 minutes to warm them up.  Rinse that water off.  Top with other things, like steamed Asian mixed vegetables.  I toss them in a little curry as well.

As other reviewers have stated...there is a fishy smell and the texture is so awfully RUBBERY....I cannot see how ANYONE (other than a desperate anorexic) would be able to stomach these things.....I had low expectations that they would be a fair substitute for actual PASTA, but really had high hopes for using them as a "rice noodle" in a Thai type dish with a peanut/pepper/ginger sauce.....well even as that....they are a NO GO in my book....I think the "If it sounds TOO GOOD to be true, it probably is" statement applies well with these.....No calories, no carbs and all that sounded great...UNTIL the first bite....

review/summary: FYI- BEFORE YOU BUY Miracle Noodles PLEASE READ THIS!
review/text: I purchased my 1st order of Miracle Noodle directly from: &lt;...>. I got them for my Mother because she needs to switch to a diet of less carbs and far less calories overall. I purchased the 10 pack of 7oz "Angel hair" noodles for $21.99 w/10.89 for shipping for a total of $32.76. A few days later I received the package. I was VERY surprised to find out that each 7oz package of Miracle Noodles ACTUALLY contained OVER 6 3/4 ounces of WATER and LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodles!!! While their marketing material does BARELY mention Water content, they are neither CLEAR nor particularly forthcoming about this fact nor the fact that it accounts for OVER 85% of the purchase product and considering the fact that they instruct you to IMMEDIATELY RINSE the Noodles before use, it's not as if your supposed to prepare the noodle using this WATER! - Well for a couple of reasons (including but not limited to the WATER volume) I decided to return them without opening even 1 package so they were COMPLETELY UNUSED). I was instructed (during a PHONE CALL to their main office) to MAIL THEM BACK  (AT MY EXPENSE) and WAS TOLD THAT I WOULD RECEIVE A FULL REFUND. Well it cost me approx another $10 to ship them back (due to the WATER WEIGHT)and a few days later I received a refund of $21.99. I PAID SHIPPING BOTH WAYS!!! So BASICALLY I PAID $20 in shipping to get a $22 so called REFUND - I PAID $42.00 and GOT BACK ONLY $21.99 !!! This may be legal but it is UNETHICAL and WRONG and when I spoke to the rep on the phone this was never mentioned! Especially for a company that claims to STAND BEHIND IT's PRODUCT 100%!!! When I contacted them by email they informed me that "THIS IS OUR POLICY" and cited the requisite schpeal on their website. I was NOT informed of this ON THE PHONE CALL at all! This so-called POLICY should be CHANGED! It may be legal but it's hardly ETHICAL or RIGHT! When is OK to get back ONLY HALF of what you spend when you return a product? IT'S NOT!! Not to MENTION THE FACT that YOU're getting LESS THAN 1/4 oz of Noodle in a 7 OZ "Package!!! RIDICULOUS!! Oh and to make matters worse: When I COMMENTED on their Shipping Policy and Water Weight on their FACEBOOK Fan page; instead of addressing the issues OPENLY, HONESTLY and DIRECTLY they IMMEDIATELY and REPEATEDLY DELETED my COMMENTS and then BLOCKED ME from making comments at all! What's that tell you???

review/summary: Slimy and Nasty
review/text: This seems like a great idea.  I have read other reviews that say the noodles take on the flavor of what you mix them with and the texture is close to that of regular pasta...this is not true.  These taste like something I already ate.  They made me sick just trying to eat them.  I had to eat something else just to keep this food down.  Do not buy.  Not worth the slimy texture.  Get low carb noodles and exercise a little.  What a waste of money.

review/summary: will help 4 sure
review/text: I first think it was very bad, but then I found the bright side: every time I think that I don't need to exercise or that I could "cheat" on my diet during the day because of the fact that this product will save me the pain, I re-think about having to taste this horrible noodles and I jump to the treadmill in a second and If I have to quit ice cream or a great hamburger for life instead of having this "fish intestines" I will have no regrets. They must be served to people in jail as punishment for their acts, so I found another motivation to behave (just in case). Don't think to much, if you are using tomato sauce and no salt,just buy whole grain pasta and you will be fine It is only 100-200 calories you safe and not worth the taste and the smell. But keep some of this noodles in your house in case of an unwanted neighbor kid wants to stay for dinner, take video of his face and make some money in AFV. So I hate the product but helped me to motivate myself to workout,stop eating calories and fats just to avoid the taste of the noodles, also to love myself as fat as I am and last to fear jail for the fact that food could taste like this.<br />Safe your money, if you want to waste it, buy me a nice plate of real pasta, the only miracle here is that some other reviewers liked it, "It is for taste is that colors exist"

review/summary: Very Disappointed :(
review/text: I wouldn't even have given this 1 star, but there was nothing lower. I read a lot of the reviews on this product (Fettuccini miracle noodles) before buying, thinking it was going to taste great. I was extremely disappointed. It was the nastiest tasting noodles I have ever come across! I don't see how anyone could think these are good. I prepared them exactly the way the directions said, and when I tasted them, I was gagging, they were SO disgusting! I actually tried on several attempts to tolerate them, but all it did was confirm of how awful these noodles are. The noodles are slimy and have a horrible texture and taste. I was going to throw them out, but my daughter saw them and I was telling her how horrible they were. She wanted to take them home and try them. I told her to go for it, but she couldn't say that I didn't warn her! My daughter and I both are NOT picky eaters at all. She called me the next day and said they were sick and she threw up after eating them. I hope this review helps others who are thinking of buying these noodles. I wish there would have been more reviews warning me of how horrible these are, because I never would have bought them! Very disappointed :( P.S. I hope the bad reviews of this product are being posted.

review/summary: A bowl of cartilage
review/text: I heard about Miracle Noodles on Dr. Oz recently and couldn't resist trying them out, because they were touted as a delicious low carb alternative to pasta. Yes, I'd read the reviews and heard a lot of horror stories about how weird they tasted and smelled, but in spite of the negative reviews, I still got a pack of these because I'm a fan of all things Asian and figured that the poor reviews were from people not used to exotic food.<br /><br />Well, I tried them and can now render my verdict. You know that saying, "The truth between two extremes lies somewhere in the middle?" Nowhere is this truer than when it comes to people's reactions to these noodles. They are neither what the haters make them out to be nor at all what the ravers claim that they are.<br /><br />Let's talk about the negative reviews first. Contrary to what so many people are saying, Miracle Noodles do not have a pungent fishy odor or the texture of squid, calamari, or rubber bands. When I first opened the bag I had to really sniff for a "fishy" smell, since it was barely discernible. However, I did smell something else, a mild aroma not unlike that of sweetened soy milk. Not to worry, as these smells easily disappeared when rinsing and boiling the noodles.<br /><br />As for the texture? Not at all "rubbery", but very... gelatinous. At first I thought it was similar to those chewy fruity bits you often find in Asian puddings and drinks. But after chomping on the noodles for awhile, the texture became unmistakeable-- it was like cartilage. And no, this is not an exaggeration. The noodles had the exact semi-gelatinous, semi-crunchy consistency of cartilage. Did the texture make these noodles inedible or the worst thing ever? Not at all. Just very... jarring.<br /><br />What about the rave reviews claiming that this product is a perfect substitute for fettucine or other types of pasta? No way, Jose. Because their texture has a "fleshy" quality to it, Miracle Noodles are more suitable as a vegetarian substitute for meat, fish, and poultry dishes, especially since they absorb flavors so well. (When I poured oyster sauce on mine, they really did taste like a seafood-like dish.) But as a replacement for pasta? Good Lord, no. Not in a million years. I can see someone hankering for these if they want to have something in lieu of meat, but there's no way someone would be craving these in lieu of pasta. There are no similarities whatsoever between the two.<br /><br />So basically, don't believe the hype about this product, because it's definitely been mismarketed to the wrong eaters. Miracle Noodles do have some potential as a staple in the diet of someone either foregoing meat altogether or trying to cut down on it. But as a substitute for pasta or carbs? Not a chance.

review/summary: A solid replacement for certain kinds of dishes
review/text: Like other reviewers I heard about the miracle noodles through Dr. Oz (Second hand as we don't have TV in our household) and decided to give them a shot.<br /><br />I got the multipack of the 7oz bags of the Fettucini style noodles. I prepared a test pack for my wife and I of the noodles exactly as described on the bag. (No microwaving them for me.)<br /><br />Opening:<br />First, I will say the noodles didn't have a pleasant aroma upon opening the pouch, but neither was really off putting. It wasn't especially strong or extremely fishy. The best I can do to describe the odor was close to that of a can of regular chunk tuna. But unlike opening that can of tuna and getting packing water on your hands the odor did all but disappear with the rinse, blanch, and a final rinse before drying on towels.<br /><br />Trying a single dried noodle was like eating the number zero if you can imagine it. It just didn't even register other than something had been in the mouth, chewed, and swallowed. There was minimal remaining odor from the fermenting and I had to really try to pick it up.<br /><br />Cooking:<br />While the noodles dried I heated a pan on medium heat with a half tsp of butter and added two or three cloves of minced garlic and cooked it until it was just browning and then tossed in the noodles. I followed this shortly with 1 1/2 Tbsp. or so of a teriyaki sauce. My wife is Korean so there is always crushed red pepper in the house, which I added three good pinches of to the mix and cooked while mixing for another couple minutes.<br /><br />I noted when the noodles hit the pan how they immediately took up the remaining butter and also a good portion of the teriyaki sauce when added. The color of the noodle went from white/semi transparent to more brown and reminded me of rice noodles in Phad Thai. There was no trace of the slight odor from their raw state at this point.<br /><br />Taste verdict:<br />Both my wife and I enjoyed them and plan to add them to other dishes as a substitute for other asian noodles. They picked up the flavor of garlic, salt, and pepper just how I wanted and expected. The next time I made them I added chicken to the mix for protein and some veggies which I felt the lack of made for a tasty but not entirely satisfying dish. (Though I did want to try them without the noodles competing with any other primary ingredients.) The next time I have left over kimchi jigae from a dinner out it will be getting a pack added to it rather than rice for my lunch.<br /><br />As a snack food or small meal I think they are good and even with my preparation here they are better across the whole nutrition label than going for a package of the Nongshim Kimchi Ramyun my wife likes sometimes. (We usually add fresh kimchi, egg, and whatever else to bulk it up a bit though. I can easily imagine doing the same with the Shirataki noodles.)<br /><br />Texture:<br />Ever had the Korean dish jabchae? The noodles give less resistance to biting than those cellophane noodles and so don't need the extra cutting with scissors before eating. Importantly it is not at all like wheat pasta. They also squeak a bit when you bite through which was unexpected but not unpleasant.<br /><br />Would I recommend them:<br />Yes, for certain dishes. I took two packages to my parents to try since my Mom was the one who told me about them but I am waiting to hear back what she thought. I am going to order some of the other shape varieties and do a test with marinara but I am not expecting a great result. The texture of the noodle is substantially different from wheat pastas and this leads me to think it won't work well, but hey I could be wrong.

review/summary: Miracle Pasta is the Best!
review/text: I have been a customer of Miracle Noodle for several months.  I have tried a variety of shapes of Miracle Noodles, including the fettuccini.  All of the Miracle Noodles are the same product, in different shapes.  I followed the instructions on the website, and did a little experimenting on my own.  My family now consumes at least one package of Miracle Noodles each day.  We started out with basic stir fries, but now, I try them in a wide variety of recipes, from soups to vegetable dishes to desserts.  The fettuccini works very well with sauces and soups, and once mixed with the other ingredients, affords a taste and feel very similar to flat noodle pasta.  I try to incorporate the noodles into everything I cook, because it provides filling, calorie-free fiber.  During the day, when hunger strikes, I usually crave something sweet.  The Miracle Noodles can be used to create sweet dishes that conquer the craving, filling me up without extra calories.  I love this product!

review/summary: Great stuff!  0 calorie and it stuffs you up!!
review/text: The noodle may smell fishy when you open it and after you wash a few times,  but just mix it up with some canned soup and voilaa you have your dinner right there!  I can't believe how this noodle just fill you up.  I can usually eat 1-2 canned soup and still need to eat some snacks,  but wew with this noodle in the soup,  I can barely finish a can.<br /><br />Just a warning.  Some people might not like how it smells at first,  and how the texture is like... (somewhat like eating jelly-fish,  chewy and almost tasteless)  but it's a great way to be healthy (I mean come on... 0 calorie?  soy free?  gluten free?) or when you are on a budget...  (eat it with whatever with sauce and it will fill you up!!)<br /><br />I am sure if you can cook,  you can probably make this noodle tastes so much better,  but for someone like me who can't cook,  heating up canned soup is as far as I can go.  Obviously not something that can fulfill your daily nutrition or something but this is just a point of view from a poor college student u know.  Survival and not being hungry is the priority :)<br /><br />So,  don't starve,  eat your vitamins,  and proteins!!!  :)

review/summary: OBVIOUSLY not the "real thing" but a great substitute!!
review/text: It cracks me up reading some of the reviewers that compare this to regular pasta. Being calorie free OF COURSE there is going to be some trade off on taste. My advice to those people is to stick to the real thing. For the rest of us this is a great option to help you feel full and offset a major amount of calories. Yes, there is some texture to them, but, considering the health benefits it is well worth it. A good option is to actually mix some into regular pasta to offset some of the calories. It is a good trick to help "trick" your mind while eating healthy. For me, a 50-50 ratio usually works. Add in even more to help feel fuller without any additional calories. Personally, for me, it doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No calories<br />Helps you feel full<br />Fiber<br />Healthy<br />"Almost" the consistency of real pasta<br /><br />Cons:<br />You need to wash the noodles in water for 30-60 seconds to dissipate the "open bag" smell<br />No taste (but it absorbs the flavor of your food)<br />Not the "real thing"

review/text: Well, I was worried after reading the reviews, but ended up pleasantly surprised with these "noodles."  If you follow the instructions, which are very clear, they taste like asian celophane noodles.<br /><br />Here is how these need to be prepared:  first, you open the package and place the contents in a strainer. Now, at first, the smell of a preservative like substance is present, but that goes away quickly once you run the noodles under cold water for about 30 seconds. Rinse them well. Then you drop them in boiling water for about a minute before putting them on paper towels to dry. Now they are ready to cook with.<br /><br />You must follow these directions, which are clearly printed on the package. Once you do, the consistency is not rubbery or like cartlidge as noted in other reviews. The noodles become much likecooked  ramen noodles.<br /><br />The one surprise to me was that these are packaged in a clear bag with a fluid. It was weird, but the fact that I can have these without fat, carbs or even calories is a huge bonus.

review/text: I got these noodles delivered about a week ago (pack of 6). I ate the last one today, so basically I've been replacing one meal a day with these.<br /><br />I really like them!<br />THE SMELL: Ok, these DO smell awful after you take them out of the package. I hate fish, so I was skeptical. But after rinsing for a full 2 minutes and patting dry with several paper towels, the smell was almost gone. The finished product was not at all fishy (see recipe at end of my review!).<br />The TEXTURE: They DO feel kind of gelatinous. Again, this goes away after cooking, and the texture is much more like a thin rice noodle.<br /><br />I literally just finished eating my daily noodle bowl- filling and delicious! Here's the recipe I've been using!<br /><br />Here's what I did:<br /><br />Rinsed the miracle noodles for 2+ minutes, and patted dry on paper towels. Cut with large kitchen knife.<br /><br />Sauteed half of an onion in pam no fat cooking spray.<br /><br />Dumped the noodles in with the onions and let cook over low-medium heat for a few minutes.<br /><br />Put in half a teaspoon of peanut butter (really, a very small amount), let it melt over the noodles.<br /><br />Put in about 2 T of ginger soy sauce.<br /><br />Put in about 1 Tablespoon of hot sauce.<br /><br />Chopped up about 8 leaves of fresh basil and threw them on top.<br /><br />Stir fried for about 2 minutes.<br /><br />And then I ate it! It was really really good- tasted like drunken thai noodles. AND, I estimate the calorie content at about 100 calories. I also feel like a few pieces of chicken breast would have gone with it really well, to add protein.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

I follwed the directions exactly: wash noodles, blanch in boiling water, and then cook (I sauteed with soy sauce and olive oil).  The flavor was ok (there really wasn't much flavor, but it soaked up the soy sauce nicely).  The texture, however, was along the lines of poorly cooked calamari.  It was rubbery and almost a little slimy - EW!<br /><br />Also - I didn't know that you can't return grocery items on Amazon, so you're pretty much stuck with what you buy here...

review/summary: Taste is fine but texture induces nausea
review/text: I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion.

review/text: First you need to get 'normal' noodles out of your head and think of these noodles as 'noodles' only in shape and size. Otherwise they are a completely different experience, one I personally like as much as wheat or rice noodles. If you buy these noodles hoping for something that tastes like normal noodles you will probably be disappointed. I bought these with an open mind - hoping that I would be able to add something to my routine without breaking my extremely low calorie diet. I have to say that these guilt-free noodles are fantastic - not rubbery or too chewy - the texture is more like mushrooms made into noodles. They don't taste like much of anything actually, and I didn't notice any smell in particular. They are perfect for adding bulk and texture to a meal without adding calories.<br /><br />I am ready to sign up for a subscription for these noodles to save a little money and because I know I will be using them regularly. Asian noodle recipes are particularly well-suited for these noodles (as opposed to Italian-style meals.)<br /><br />I highly recommend this product... for what it is.

review/summary: It's Great to Have Pasta Again
review/text: A quick look at the reviews of this product shows that people are divided as to whether this is a guilt free pasta dream come true or whether this is a nasty, smelly, slimy nightmare.  And I fall solidly into the "Dream Come True" camp.<br /><br />As a person with miltiple food allergies and type 2 diabetes, my diet had become a bland, monotinous string of meat and vegetables.  I don't like "fake" food and so I had opted out of substitutes like fake cheese, low carb bread, and artificial sweeteners.  Then I ran across these noodles (my doctor carries a line of low carb foods in his office), and decided that I would try them once, even if I probably wouldn't ever want to eat them again.<br /><br />I am really glad I tried them.  I like the texture, and the taste is so bland that they quickly soak up any flavor that is cooked into them.  The initial odor coming out of the package is kind of "fishy", but that goes away quickly as the noodles are prepared and they absorb the flavors and aromas of the foods they are cooked with.  The texture is slippery, stretchy, and chewy - kind of like I remember real pasta being.  Some reviewers said that they didn't like the "slimy" texture, but I didn't find it to be any slimier than real pasta.  In any case, it didn't bother me at all<br /><br />I started with spaghetti and meatballs, then I had buttered noodles, and then I had noodles with taco meat and a yummy mexican sauce with olives and avacado.  Then there was my allergen free version of Pad Thai.  The list goes on and on and I have never failed to love whatever I have used them in.  AND my blood sugar stays within the normal range!<br /><br />I tried several shape varieties, and I like the fettuccini noodles the best for pasta because they have substance.  I like the shiratake rice as a rice substitute.  I used the "fake rice" for a stuffed zucchini dish that was to die for - my whole family dove in and raved for more!  Shiratake noodles are now a part of my diet and long term lifestyle, and I have enrolled in the Subscribe and Save program because I use them so often.<br /><br />Shiratake noodles are something a person either loves or hates, and there doesn't seem to be much in between, so I recommend that anyone who isn't sure and wants to try it once should buy from the Miracle Noodle website because they accept returns if you don't like the product.  If you like them, you can then purchase from Amazon, but first time users should buy directly from the manufacturer.

review/summary: sub for pasta ?
review/text: You will never mistake this  for real pasta .  You must rinse  very well or the odor will kill . It absorbs water and is very difficult to dry which waters down the sauce you are using. Now onto the good stuff  0 calories 0 carbs , together with a low carb calorie sauce it is a winner . better than no pasta i wish they could figure out a way to dry them tottaly

review/summary: For zero calories, this is amazing
review/text: This is a great replacement for regular pasta. It's obviously not going to be exactly like traditional pasta, so if you're looking for something that's like the real thing you'd be wise to pass on this. But if you're looking for a substitute that's going to fill you up and you're open to new things, this isn't half bad.<br /><br />All first time Shirataki users should know this (and all Shirataki) comes in a horrendous smelling fluid which you have to wash off for a min or two. Once its rinsed and drained, you throw it into any pasta dish you'd normally make. I personally like to cook up a pan of fresh home made sauce and then cook noodles through the sauce for about 7 mins so they absorb some of the flavor. Just made some tonight and it was really quite good.<br /><br />I also want to add, the Miracle Noodle brand is also far superior to the refrigerated Shirataki noodles you see in the store. Much better texture in my opinion.

review/summary: Gross!! Don't waste your money!
review/text: I feel for all the hype on these noodles.  I bought the six pack of the angel hair noodles.  I followed directions on the package and then served them in my stir fry as my noodles.  They smell like fish, and have a texture like worms.  It is the most horrible thing I have ever put in my mouth.  Now I have five left and can't return these things.  I may try putting them outside to see if the birds or raccoons will eat them.

review/summary: NO CALORIES, NO CARBS & GLUTEN FREE
review/text: I had to write this review to balance out all the bad reviews for this product because I love these and haven't been able to find them at a decent price in FL.<br /><br />I discovered these in Tucson AZ at a Whole Foods. I really enjoyed the similarity to pasta with NO CALORIES, NO CARBS, and GLUTEN FREE. I got spoiled buying them very inexpensively, and using them with Alfredo sauce or soupy India dishes.<br /><br />They look like noodles but they do not taste like wheat-based noodles. They have a very mild nutty flavor with no odor at all.  They are almost gelatinous in texture but not quite, more like extremely over-cooked rice noodles. Not gummy, but a very loose version of a noodle. You have to cut them into pieces or they slide off the serving spoon.<br /><br />This type of "noodle" is definitely an acquired taste but goodness, you can eat a plate of "almost noodles" without consuming any carbs or many calories.  It is a compelling combination, but if you expect them to taste like noodles, you will be disappointed. If you eat them with an open mind, a good thick sauce, pieces of meat or shrimp or sausage as part of your dish, some vegetables as well, I think you might enjoy them.<br /><br />I love them now but it wasn't love at first sight. Just don't think of them as real noodles, because beyond the shape they have little in common with noodles and that's the good news. NO CALORIES, NO CARBS, NO GLUTEN.<br /><br />And more good news.  The smaller bags of Shirataki noodles I used to pay $.99 for are now $3.99 in the store. Buying these here is a bargain if you enjoy them.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: I heard wonderful things about these noodles, wish I had read all the reviews and not just the ones on the first page. They were awful! My daughter wouldn't even try them but got a good laugh at me trying to eat some. I had ordered 2 (6 pack) packages to get the free shipping and so sorry I wasted my money. I tried, I really, really tried. I so wanted them to work out but they just make me gag. I've tried them with 3 different types of sauces, with soup and a stir fry. Still Yuck. Bummer, and I know now I can't return them. When I first opened the box I could smell the fishy smell. And now my pantry has that fishy smell too. Don't waste your money!!!!!!

review/summary: Noodles? anyone?
review/text: I tried these and they are......different. At first they reminded me of.....ummmm......Nothing! The texture is weird and a bit slimy or slippery, they have no taste and are a bit translucent, so I was not thinking noodles when I saw them in the package or began preparing them, which is rather a quick process and I liked that. I got the Fettuccine style. They are rather long and do not like to stay on the fork, so I cut them up and that was better. I put them in stir fry and mixed them into the veggies and meat and it was OK. I felt satisfied with the meal and have continued to use them maybe once a week to boost the volume of certain meals. I think I might try a thinner style next time.<br /><br />Bottom line, these are NOT pasta but, if you must, try them and see how you like them.

review/text: Miracle Noodles were ok but the smell is just off-putting. Also, they have a weird, artificial feel to them (although it's just plant fiber) I tried them twice and decided against buying them again.<br /><br />I understand people buy these for a variety of reasons; if you are just trying to avoid empty carbs and overly processed foods and are not too concerned with calorie intake, try Black Bean Spaghetti or Mung Bean Fettuccini. These products are actually really healthy, high in protein and taste great!

review/summary: It's on our menu hit parade!
review/text: These noodles are similar to cellophane noodles in Asian food.  Thanks to other reviewers recommending rinsing thoroughly and dry frying in a non-stick skillet to remove water, my husband and I have both prepared really good noodle stir-fry dinners with these noodles.<br /><br />I have to eat gluten-free, I have to watch my carbs and I'm trying to lose weight.  These noodles are perfect for us.  Would I try feeding them to my sister that thinks boiled eggs have an icky texture?  Probably not.<br /><br />My favorite thing to fix is simply prep the noodles in one skillet and in another, larger skillet, cook a bag of frozen onions & peppers until the water is gone, add broccoli, whatever other veggies are handy and some form of protein (turkey, chicken or tofu -- whatever is handy) and add some sauce.  We've used soy sauce and chili paste but our favorite are the Tasty Bite Rogan Josh Simmer Sauce and a few other prepared sauces (look at the nutrition info, some are high in calories and sugar).  The noodles take on the flavor of whatever sauce you use so a tastier, more strongly flavored sauce works great.<br /><br />I believe you should try to know yourself.  If you don't like the texture of cooked mushrooms, boiled eggs or standard pasta, you won't like these.  It's not Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />Eating GF got me used to different pastas and other things a long time ago.  These noodles are a great addition to allow me to have noodles without carbs. the Subscribe and Save option makes it more affordable than some gluten-free pasta.<br /><br />Just a couple of sauces I've tried:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KWZHD2">Tasty Bite Rogan Josh Simmer Sauce, Heat & Eat, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046HEVBC">Seeds of Change Certified Organic Tikka Masala Simmer Sauce -- 12 oz</a>

review/text: Once you get past the bag opening/rinsing part, it's all good from there. I find that this Miracle Noodle brand seems to be the least stinky compared to all the many other shiratake noodles I've tried. You have to rinse them for a good 30 seconds in cold water and then cook them with something flavorful for a few minutes to get the stink out. Once the smell is gone, you've got zero calorie noodles that taste like whatever you've cooked them with.

review/summary: Perfect substitute for wide rice noodles!
review/text: These are a perfect substitute for wide rice noodles; I made a stir fry tonight and it was delicious! These noodles hold up much better than rice noodles - don't break and don't get soggy. Also I don't have to obsessively time these since they are cooked and really only need blanching to warm them through (it usually takes about 30 min to soak rice noodles and it's easy to overdo it; not a problem with these).<br /><br />I WOULD NOT use them in a "pasta" recipe like carbonara, marinara, etc. 'Cause you wouldn't use rice noodles in those recipes, that's why! Personally, I think it's a mistake that the company is labeling these as "Fettucini". This sets up a wrong expectation. They should label these as "wide noodles".

review/text: Read about these and despite the mixed reviews decided to give them a try.  Are they just like regular pasta?  No way.  But I think they are tasty when prepared as directed.  Mix them with a wedge of light spreadable swiss cheese and a sprinkle of salt and parmesan cheese and they are delicious.  They are smelly until rinsed and drained, and the texture is chewy, but overall a great option for those of us who have to watch our carb intake more.  I would not recommend eating more than one package a day because that is a setup for some gastric distress.

review/summary: Love these, so glad I didn't "listen" to the negative reviews!!
review/text: Okay, so I read all of the negative reviews, and was SO hesitant to order these noodles. I am thankful for the negative reviews however since they had me expecting the worst.  I was so pleasantly surprised to find that following some of the positive reviewers recipes, they were a godsend for someone like me, following a low carb diet. I've included one of my own concoctions at the end of this review.<br /><br />Fishy smell? Yeah, but like others have written, if you rinse them it goes away, and after drying them off (I dry them off on a hot frying pan with no oil) the smell is completely gone. The smell wasn't really an issue for me though, since I don't mind the fishy smell so much.<br /><br />True, the texture isn't exactly like the texture of traditional noodles, but I have to agree with the other optimists...It's an awesome alternative.<br /><br />So, my favorite recipe is for one serving, and a total of 5 net carbs. This includes an entire package of the Fettucini style Miracle Noodles (yes...I eat the whole package. hahaha):<br /><br />Get the following ingredients ready before throwing the noodles on the hot frying pan<br />2 tablespoons water<br />2 tablespoons unsweetened heavy cream<br />2 tablespoons Campbell's Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup<br />1 teaspoon of a low carb Szechuan seasoning (they're not listed as low carb, you just have to find one with a low to no sugar content. The one I use has less than 1 gram of carbs per teaspoon)<br />50 grams (1.8 ounces) of raw broccoli<br />30 grams (1.1 ounces) of raw spinach<br />113.4 grams (4 ounces) of chopped chicken (I like to buy the already cooked, rotisserie chickens from Costco)<br /><br />Rinse the noodles, and then put them in a hot frying pan to dry off<br />Once the noodles are dry, add the Szechuan seasoning until the noodles are coated,<br />add the heavy cream, the Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup, and then the water followed by the chicken.<br /><br />Allow the chicken to warm up before adding the veggies.<br /><br />I add the broccoli and the spinach last, but just enough to get them coated with the creamy sauce, 'cause I like my veggies crunchy. :-)

review/text: I found an article in a health magazine about this No Oodle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z4F56C">No Oodles Zero Carb, Zero Calorie Shirataki Noodles 10 Pack Angel Hair</a> product and could not wait to try this.  I am working the Weight Watcher Point Plus Program and love to try their recipes.  I took a 9 point Pad Thai recipe (available with the E-tools Membership) which called for rice noodles and substituted the angel hair No Oodle product.  I thought the results were outstanding.  They tasted exactly like rice noodles to me and really absorbed the yummy flavors of garlic, ginger and lime.  I did follow preparation tips exactly including copious rinsing and dry frying the noodles until all water was evaporated.  My son also enjoyed them, my husband not so much.  I felt full and satisfied and the noodles reduced that meal from a 9 point meal to about 4 points plus.  WOW  (My husband claimed he was actually hungrier AFTER eating dinner than he was before, but I think that was just an excuse to snack!!)  I am trying the flat noodles next, possibly with a creamy type sauce.  I recommend you give these a try.

review/text: Yes, these "noodles" DO have a fishy smell when opened. The texture is long and stringy and has the texture of some kind of eel, or ligament..... Not exactly appetizing. However, you can search around online and find how others who also did not like this product have learned how to rinse, sautee', and have made them taste a lot better. Rinsing is definitely key. And then cooking them with a few seasonings on med-low is also recommended. If you open the package and just dump them water and all into your recipe, you will NOT be happy.
