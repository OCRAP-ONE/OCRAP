review/text: Great flavor.  Beware... if you love cheezy-savory snacks, you might find it hard to stop at just one 0.5 ounce bag!  The "Grilled Cheese" flavor supposedly has the least sodium content compared to the other flavors, but it's still quite salty.  Would definitely buy again.

review/summary: Cheese - with c crunch!
review/text: This was a surprising product.  It has the look of little 'chips' of some type. But pop one in you mouth and start chewing, and a rich, wonderful cheese flavor fills you mouth.  If you love cheese, this convenient little package of goodness is for you!  The package is quite small and there is not a lot of product inside but it is just the right amount to satisfy a craving for a real cheese snack.

review/summary: Great crunch on a diet, but watch that salt!
review/text: If you are watching your carbs, this is a great little snack, it's what it says it is... baked cheese. It's actually pretty good, but very salty.<br /><br />They come in these little bowl shaped discs about the size of a nickle in little 1/2 ounce bags. Great for control of what you are eating so you don't just pour a big bowl of them (and because they are so salty). They are super crunchy but disintegrate in your mouth pretty quickly.<br /><br />So far, I've tried the Wisconsin Cheddar and the White Cheddar version. The white cheddar is basically the same, just has a little more "bite" to it. I'll be looking at the lower salt and popped versions soon to change it up a little and maybe cut some of the salt.<br /><br />Worth a try if you are low carb or if you just want something a little more healthy than chips - they are pretty low calorie per bag as well, but the bags are pretty small. They satisfy my mid-day crunch cravings though!

review/summary: Tasty, but tiny!
review/text: I was expecting something akin to cheese-flavored rice cakes. These were much tastier! Crunchier too. However, I was also expecting each bag to be the size of a small bag of potato chips. Wrong. The bags are just a little larger than those of gummy fruit snacks. Each mini round is about the size of a nickel and there aren't all that many in a bag. I bought the Classic White Cheddar ones, which I found to be very yummy. I just wish there were more to enjoy for the price.

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Okay, let me start by saying that these snacks will really appeal to those who have had some sort of bariatric surgery.  At only 75 calories, 5 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbs per serving I cannot think of a healthier salty "treat" to indulge in.  The package is very small only 1/2 an oz so its a good size for those of us who can only eat very small portions.  The taste is very much like the crunchy cheese that gets stuck to a pizza pan.  I have only tried the "grilled cheese" flavor which doesn't have any additional flavoring powder on it so I think it is less salty than other versions of this snack.  I will be ordering them again, for sure!

review/text: Like many on the Atkins diet, I needed something that I could put in my bag as a snack to keep me from buying any number of high carb snacks.  These cheese mini rounds are crunchy and tasty.  They fill the bill, but only get 3 stars are they are pretty pricey for the very small amount that each bag contains.  And if you are at home, there are a few sliced cheeses that you can microwave yourself and get and even better crunchy cheesey snack.

review/text: I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state.

review/text: I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving.

review/text: I was looking for something crunchy, salty and low carb after my vertical gastric sleeve.  These are amazing.  I am one of those people who prefer the burnt cheese from a casserole or grilled cheese, so these were appealing based on that preference.  I shared them with coworkers.  The other cheese-lover couldn't get enough.  Another co-worker hated them.  Another plus was that it is hard to get through the entire bag before filling up (but, I'm post-op bariatric surgery).  They may be a little pricey, but to me they are worth it.

review/text: I just adore these snacks!  I've only tried white cheddar so far but am coming back to try another flavor.  I bought them when doing Atkins, at just 1 carb per serving, yet crunchy and tasty, it was quite a nutritional bargain!  Now I've switched to Weight Watchers and these yummy little gems are only 2 points plus per pack.  There may be an acquired-taste period for the first pack, but it passes quickly. I can not say enough about Just the Cheese; whenever I get a craving to reach for high fat, high carb snacks (chips, buttered popcorn, whatever), I reach for these and I am satisfied without breaking the budget.  Love them.

It's difficult to find high-protein snacks that are easily portable for a briefcase or carry-on bag in case of getting stuck on a delayed flight with nothing available that she could eat (which has happened more than she would like!)

I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag.  I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to.  The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese.  Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors.  Oh well, it was worth a try.

review/text: Another awesome little snack for the diabetic, low carb dieter or post-op weight loss surgery patients.  Protein and low car/sugar is great and these come in little packages of bite size goodnees.  For WLS, they are very easy to chew and swallow and the packages are just righ to take along.

review/summary: Salty and a tad boring
review/text: I like the single-serving bags, and this is the second batch of JtC rounds I've bought, but they certainly aren't my favorite snack.<br /><br />They are crunchy, and have a decent texture, but they're saltier than I'd prefer.  They're what I reach for when I want something salty, or when I'm just bored with the rest of the snacks on hand.<br /><br />I'm not sure I can tell a difference between the Nacho flavor rounds and the "plain" ones.

review/text: I was kind of excited about this product before it came in.  I found them in a little Atkins carb counter brochure, and thought I'd give it a shot.  I was very disappointed to find out that they do NOT taste like cheese crust. They taste like salted cardboard, but being I am sticking to this low carb thing, I do find myself eating them just for the crunch and the fact that I have already wasted $17 bucks on them.

review/text: These are small and very salty. The taste is good, but very strong, so it's a good thing the package contains a small amount. It only takes a few little crisps to cure my salty/crunchy craving. I can snack on one package for an entire day. Of course these would not be a good snack if you're very hungry, because there isn't enough there to fill you up. For less than $1 per pack it's an okay deal.

review/text: I love that the snacks are good in protein, low carbohydrates, but the amount of sodium is too much.  I hope my letter to the company will help them develop a low sodium product.  In the meantime, I only eat one of the packages every two weeks of less.  I am looking forward to the more healthy product. If you are not concerned about the sodium content, then this is the snack to eat.

review/summary: Weird and gritty
review/text: They are hard and crunchy, very salty, and with a hint of a burnt taste. They are gritty after chewing and need to be washed down with some water. I was hoping for something more like cheetos, but that's probably not possible with pure cheese. I prefer my own chips made by microwaving slices of cheddar. A positive is that these are a low carb snack that doesn't need refrigeration and you can eat on the run.

I purchased the Wisconsin Cheddar, and I couldn't even eat all of one of the little bags, it was such an OD of sodium that I literally made a pucker face.  I'm not shy about salt, but these are pretty much unpalatable...and I have 15 more packs!  Maybe the other flavors don't taste as salty, but buyer beware.

Finding snacks that you can incorporate into a low carb diet is difficult sometimes. This is a very good low carbohydrate snack. These have No MSG, wheat and are gluten free as well. They would be good for any type of diet. Only 75 calories and 1/2 carb per serving. They taste quite good. I've made cheese chips at home and these taste very much like them. We are looking forward to trying another flavor next time.

review/summary: I love them, Great Low Carb Snack
review/text: When I ordered was somewhat nervous, because of other ratings that were negative.  So relieved when they got here and I tried them.  They taste like oven baked cheddar bites-which I really like.  If you ordered them thinking they were going to be exactly like potato chips, you would be disappointed.  I have been on a low carb diet since Feb now and look for snack type items, with crunchy being a big plus-these are very tasty and I will definitely be getting them again.  (as well as trying some of the other flavors!)  They are salty, which I like.  I have to disclose however that my DH is not as happy with them as I am -we do have a tendancy to like opposite flavors.  So for me that just means more for my lunch pail.  But if you are like me and scrape the cheese off the cookie sheet when your baking has some overflow-you will probably really like these.  Only rated them 4 star because of DH -who still ate them by the by and said he would rate them as ok, so since I would say 5 star.  Compromise, right?

review/summary: They are a great crunchy, salty, low carb snack!
review/text: These things are great if you're on a low carb diet, and I find them really satisfying.  If you're looking for some kind of gourmet cheese item, this isn't it; its a potato chip replacement that's more about crunch and a salty, tangy taste to satisfy an urge. However, I personally would eat them even if I wasn't on a diet! As for the amounts; each bag is only 75 calories!  So if you really want more, then open another one, but when you're on a diet, usually just one does the trick (see "urges" above)! They are more expensive than potato chips, but at less than a dollar a bag, you could do a whole lot worse! I've only had the "classic white cheddar" flavor and am trying a new flavor this week.  I'll let you know how it goes.

review/text: I have had some of the other cheese snacks, and liked the nacho flavored.  If you have not had these before, they are literally cheese formed into a small disk and baked until hard like a cracker.  Being a low carb guy, I like them because they are easy to pack along, and are reminiscent of the crunch you get from crackers.  This particular flavor though, is underwhelming, there is not enough jalapeno flavor, and the whole thing tastes a bit like bland cheese.  Still, they are ok, and I will eat them, but not as tasty as some of the other offerings.....

It tastes pretty fresh.<br /><br />Some reviewers noted they thought it was spicy, so I tried it alone the first time instead of adding my normal cayenne or red pepper flakes. My husband and I did not feel it really had any heat to it on its own, but again I do usually add spicy stuff in so it just may be it was not to our threshold of noticing.<br /><br />All in all, this has replaced my previous favourite curry powder!

review/text: As a life-long American, these were actually something I just randomly tried from a local specialty store.  Now I am addicted.  I like them better than traditional oatmeal, the taste is more creamy and hearty.  The funny thing is that the word "porridge" to me has a connotation of slop that is served as sustenance more than flavor.  However, I can tell you that I love this stuff and I feel like it is actually the gourmet version of oatmeal.  If you prepare it with water it is quite good, and prepared with milk it is simply amazing.

Then I found Flahavan's in a British shop and they were declared a success.  Not wanting to drive an hour each way and pay six dollars a bag for them, I am happy to find them on Amazon for around three dollars a bag and free shipping with Prime.  These are very tasty, although I'm more of a fan of the steel cut oats.

(I served mine up with a dash of cinnamon, and a sprinkling of coconut sugar- after tasting it alone).<br /><br />  ...This is hands down the best tasting oats my family and I have ever tasted!  It's not chewy or tough, and it doesn't require pre-soaking to get a smooth texture.<br /><br />  I don't recall having seen this brand in my local store, so when we run out, I'll be re-ordering!

review/summary: Perfect porridge! Finally found after 20 years trying others.
review/text: After my lifelong mission to find porridge that could please persnickety Goldilocks, I am relieved to say Flahavan's fills the bill.<br /><br />  As a kid I never liked oatmeal, but porridge was so storied I kept trying, since oatmeal was supposedly it. When I was 14, I visited England, finally tried the real thing, and it was love. Unfortunately, back in the States I could never find anything comparable. So I just kept looking. One restaurant had a tasty and properly textured version, which they claimed was a proprietary porridge blend, but they didn't sell the oats, just the meal at breakfast. I've had the discussion many times: you'd expect all oats are oats, and therefore taste similar if prepared in similar fashion, but they simply don't. I tried every kind of oats I could get my hands on, from German and Scottish imports to bulk hippie/health food co-op organic. Steel-cut, rolled, slow, quick, everything! I soaked overnight and boiled stovetop; used milk, water, cream, and mixtures of them in varying amounts. In spite of wasting a lot of time and oats over the years, I didn't give up.<br /><br />  Like another reviewer here, I found Flahavan's at a Wegmans. A brand I hadn't seen before! Surely it would be a failure like the rest, but it's a pretty small package, why not just try? Thank goodness I bought it. I can't speak with authority for those in the UK, because as demonstrated by my not having seen Flahavan's in 20 years of US oat shopping, you must have many brands I won't encounter here. In the US, Flahavan's is the only brand I've been able to find to make porridge oats that taste like the delicious porridge I had in England. And that's just their simple, microwave in 3 minutes oats! Crazy to imagine after all the trouble I've gone to trying to stew up the perfect porridge. Wegmans is foolish for discontinuing Flahavan's, but I'm thankful they had it for me to find when I did.<br /><br />  For anyone out there looking for creamy (oat-creamy, even made with just water), tasty, tender, truly porridge-y oats, do yourself a favor and try Flahavan's. Even if you think you've got something decent---I used to eat McCann's sometimes, but even though other people in my family still buy it, to me it now tastes so bad in comparison I simply can't settle for it. I'm still open to trying new oats, but for me the lifelong fantasy porridge oats quest has found a firm footing in reality with Flahavan's fairytale deliciousness.

review/summary: OMG....THE BEST!!!!!
review/text: I have been eating ONLY Flahavan's brand for about 4 years. I noticed by accident as well, in Wegman's, and now nothing else will do! I just went online to order directly from the Flahavan's site in Ireland since Wegman's just discontinued selling it......not enought of us true Irish porridge eaters I guess. I was excited to see Amazon sells it. It is the best/quickest method when done in the microwave. I do the 1/2 cup porridge to 1 cup 1% milk, nuking for 2:15 minutes [make sure you use a deep bowl, as directed] and it's sensational.....creamy, hearty, great flavor.  I add walnuts, Splenda, and sometimes raisins or sugar-free Log Cabin if I'm in the mood. Even if you're not an oatmeal afficionado, try this.......good for you, and soooooooo yummy too.

review/text: If you think you know oatmeal but haven't tried Flahavan's Irish Porridge Oats, then you aren't living yet.  Our "porridge" is so flavorful and hearty that I feel like it's the "good mood" breakfast.  Of course my favorite way is with butter and brown sugar, but a spoon full of blackberry preserves or a handful of Craisins and we're into a whole new experience.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Peppers ready whenever you are
review/text: Have used dehydrated green peppers for many, many years.  They used to be readily available in grocery stores, then they just sort of disappeared.  Knowing Amazon comes through for me all the time, I was able to locate them through Amazon and am again ready for any recipe requiring green peppers.  I seldom re-hydrate them and generally use them in recipes that have enough moisture to begin with.  Very happy to again have this product.

review/summary: Nasty after taste!
review/text: It would probable be good in chili, but it sucks mixed with instant rice.  There was a bitter after taste that lasted long after the meal, as well.  I'll try pre-washing the dust off, and rehydrating in a seperate pot, next time.  Part of the problem might be that the pepers were not cooked before dehydration.

review/text: Over the past year or so I have come to appreciate the depth of flavor in many dried and dehydrated vegetables.  They are great in anything that requires a long cooking time.  I was, however, disappointed in these peppers.  They are quite bitter and the container has many seeds in it.  If you are looking for the flavor of sweet bell peppers, it is not to be found here.

review/summary: Always a tasty snack
review/text: If you love Cheez-It's as much as I do, then you will simply love these.  They are the exact same product as the smaller cracker, but over twice the size.  Because they are larger, air seems to form in the center of the cracker, making them even more crispy than their little brother crackers, the traditional Cheez-It's.  Once you try the large size crackers, there is no turning back, trust me on that.  The flavor is explosive and they are the best cheese cracker on the market.  Now, if only they could offer a Cheez-It in a "well-done" version, where all the crackers in the box were a little burnt, my favorites, I would be ecstatic!

review/text: I love these big cheez-its, but, the boxes I received were all ground up.  At least 30% or more of the contents were ground into very small pieces, and the rest was broken up into larger pieces.  The salt flaked off most of the crackers that were big enough to look at, and they had an odd taste to them.<br /><br />While I will buy Cheez-Its again because I do like them, I will not ever buy them over the internet again.

review/text: These are great cookies - a treat when a treat is what is needed. Can't eat just one. Unless it is the one bag of them. I don't like crunchy cookies in general but these are the exception. The are not completely crunchy - they have a bit of a shortbread texture to them to soften that crunch a bit. Lovely chocolate - and that is very important to me. When I make homemade chocolate chip cookies (that my Dad says are the best of everyones) I use only the best chocolate chips (Ghirardelli or Scharffen Berger. These are a great substitute when I don't feel like baking!!

I've opened two canisters so far and have a grand total of 2 unbroken cookies in one canister and 3 whole cookies and 2 more half cookies in the other.  The rest is tiny, tiny crumbs.  It should make good pressed pie crust.  It really is so yummy and I do have two more canisters to open, but I'm so disappointed that they are too broken up to serve to guests.  ADDENDUM...just opened another canister and these cookies are fine...and very delicious.
