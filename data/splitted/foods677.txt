review/summary: I did not like these at all
review/text: To my taste, I found there to be almost no cheese flavor at all. There was also an odd background flavor that was not at all to my taste.<br /><br />This, of course, is my personal view, probably skewed by my own eating habits. Your experience may vary.<br /><br />For the record, I don't think that Cheetos taste like cheese, either!

review/summary: Organic Orange !
review/text: Organic ornage juice is difficult for me to find until Amazon offered this.  Rocky Mountain organic frozen ornage juice is awesome.  Its only 100 calories for 8 fl ounces and theres no added sugars or chemicals.  It arrives frozen and feshly packed on ice packs.  Shipping is extremely expensive so order many to get your money's worth.  I was very pleased with this purchase and the company gave me free samples ot their grape & lemonade flavors too.  No pulp and mix with flitered water with just 24 ounces per 8 oz frozen.<br />Its USDA certified organic and you won't be dissapointed in the product.<br />If the shipping was cheaper I would buy this on a weeklty basis.  Something you must try if you are into healthy living/foods.<br />5 stars

review/text: We have an 18 year old tortoise shell cat and she loves Pinnacle.  She can't eat chunky/shredded wet food or dry food any longer and is quite finicky. It's a bit more expensive than dry or even the store bought brands, but the vet says that canned food is the only way to go with an older cat to make sure they are getting enough hydration.

review/text: Oh man, I do adore this flavor of Luna Bar.  And yes I'm a boy.  Come out of the closet, gender-defiant Luna eaters!<br /><br />One concern.  As of August 2012, this listing doesn't specify how many bars are in the box.  If you're paying more than 99 cents per bar, you can do better at Trader J's or BB and B (if your BBB carries items like this).  Targ&eacute;e has them for about $1.15 each in bulk.  I think there are bulk places that might beat these all.  Caveat emptor.<br /><br />But this flavor is delicious.

All of the figs in that bag were soft and full of flavor, perfect for eating straight from the bag.<br /><br />I came here hoping to find them and I see that the Subscribe and Save deal on this is excellent (I paid 70 cents more per bag locally today). Pity the 10-ounce bag isn't currently available.<br /><br />The other reviewer's experience really surprised me. They didn't say what the best before date was. The bag I bought today has an expiration date of Aug 2013 and the figs were not tough or dried-out at all.<br /><br />I can't wait to make bread with these delicious little figs.

review/text: I really enjoy eating mission figs as a healthy snack when I am in the mood for something sweet.  Orchard Choice is the only brand of mission figs carried by my local grocery store.  With no other choices, I have bought these several times.  They are always tough and dried out.  I know they are "dried fruit", but they don't have to be this bone dry.  I recommend the Sun Maid mission figs for sale here at Amazon.  They are always very moist and delicious.  Don't waste your time with these figs.

review/summary: a bit coarse
review/text: Sadly, I first tried Fireworks brand popcorn salt. It clung well to the popcorn, and was it was quite fine. I came across it in a gift pack, so when I ran out, I was unable to find more as a stand-alone product.<br /><br />So I picked this 6-pack up. The salt is more coarse, thus it doesn't stick to popcorn as well. I would've probably been happy as a pickle if I had tried this first, as popcorn salt has disappeared off grocery store shelves (beggars can't be choosers). So, if this is all there is to find, it works. If you can find something more fine, I would opt for that choice.

review/text: I admit that I am only reviewing this here because of my frustration with this product.  My store stopped carrying the old standby brand with the adjustable sift top and only carries this fancy labeled alternative now.  The holes are simply too big for fine salt; you cannot get good control if you seek perfection in your seasoning.  I have ruined more than one batch using this dispenser.  Unless you are extremely careful, you will oversalt your popcorn.

review/summary: My Dog Loves These
review/text: I have a one and half year old Labrador Retriever that is still nuts. You probably know how desctructive a big dog can be. These take about two to three weeks until its at the point I need to just throw it away. My local SuperPetz used to carry these, and then they stopped. Here I am online buying them. My dog seems to prefer the shape of the Brontosaurus to the T-Rex. I think this because he will just chew on the T-Rex, but he actually plays with the Brontosaurus. Also, I have two other dogs that are older (around five), and they won't touch these toys unless they are playing with the young Lab.<br /><br />Sidenote: At Walmart, I have found the Hartz Chew'N Clean Dog Bone Country Bacon Flavored Large. He also loves that one, and it is $5. I have to get him a new one every other week.

review/summary: Updated: Durable So Far--Not Really
review/text: I ordered this for my 15-lb Jack Russell. We got the stegosaurus toy and so far, it's held up. She's a ferocious chewer--we can't buy her anything but Nylabone-type toys or they immediately get torn to bits. The only problem I foresee is that the stegosaurus has four legs sticking off of the body, and I know those are going to get worn down very quickly as she can fit that whole part in her mouth at once, meaning she can't play with this unless we're there to see her least she chew off a leg and choke on it. It would've been nice to be able to have seen this variety and choose which one we wanted prior to ordering. I was thinking we would get the T-Rex pictured, which only has two feet that seem to be attached to the tail. The good news is, steggie doesn't have a small projectile head or tail, but rather it curves to give the impression of head and tail, so no worries about small pieces coming off there. The toy itself I would probably give 3.5 or 4 stars, but I am only giving it an overall 3 because the ordering process is inflexible.<br /><br />UPDATE: I have lowered my rating to 2 stars. She has had this less than 5 months and I had to take it away from her after she managed to chew away the legs, tail, head, and half the body. I don't mind if she ingests tiny shreds of a Nylabone on occasion, but I can't imagine eating 4 ounces of plastic is doing anyone's digestive tract any favors.

When I got this in the mail, she was so excited, she took it in her mouth and ran in the other room to chew. She loves this and it keeps her (somewhat) from chewing on the furniture, etc.  Just make sure and pick it up before heading to bed at night - I've stepped on it in the dark - ouch! LOL

review/summary: Great chew toy
review/text: This looks like an awkward and not very amusing toy, but both of my dogs are crazy about them.  They've had one for months and they chew on it everyday, so we ended up getting another one so that our two dogs won't have to fight over it.  They are avid chewers but only are able to break off little harmless shreds off of these toys, so they are really durable.  A great buy!

review/summary: torn...
review/text: I'm a little torn between 4 & 5 stars...Daisy (25-lb. terrier / minpin / border collie mix) absolutely LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  I actually had to stop her from chewing it when I first gave it to her.  If I had let her, she probably would have chewed for another hour (since she had gone a full hour without stopping for anything).  The only downside (and I don't know if her teeth are still setting, but I know she has all her adult teeth so it can't be that her baby teeth are still falling out) is that her gums were bleeding after.  I found traces of blood on the toy as well.  I'm sure it is natural for her gums to bleed a little as the toy is pretty sharp, but I am limiting her use of it regardless.  If we are talking about how much she loves it, however, it's 5,000 stars.  lol....

review/summary: Paws down, this is a favorite!
review/text: My two terrier mixes (20 lbs. and 32 lbs.) love to chew, and their paws-down favorites over the past five years have been Nylabone Dental Dinosaurs. We go through 2-3 sets per year and have have no problems, with the exception of an occasion bit of gum bleeding (very slight) when someone gets a bit carried away. Well, that, and having to confiscate the toys when we're trying to sleep, since their chewing enjoyment is a bit too noisy for nighttime!<br /><br />After months of use, I take the worn down toys away and replace them, and I regularly check to make sure there are no sharp edges or larger parts that look as if they could break off and be ingested.<br /><br />If you have a dog that loves chewing, I've say to give them a try, at first with supervision. If your dogs are like mine, these toys will offer many hours of entertainment and cleaner teeth to boot.

review/summary: Not for Powerful Chewers
review/text: My dog (45lb terrier mix) loves to chew on things, and can go through even the "virtually indestructible" bones. With that said, he LOVES this bone (we got the stegosaurus), but he made a dent in it within the first 5 minutes. I wish Nylabone would take the "virtually indestructible" material and shaped into fun shapes like this. Luckily the dino chews are rather inexpensive so I don't mind getting these for him but be wary if your dog has big strong teeth and don't want to keep buying them.

Okay, they still fight over them, but not as much, but whoever looses the battle can easily find another dinosaur to claim.

review/text: The first time I bought this for my rottie/hound/lab mix he didn't stop chewing it for an hour which was the longest by far anything had held his attention.  It's extremely durable - I didn't need to buy another one for 5 months and that was only because it started getting small enough where it was about to become a choking hazard.  I bought one for my mother's cavachaun who is an avid chewer and it's also kept him content.  It does a great job of keeping plaque build up off his teeth, as I just noticed now that he has been without one for a couple months and I'd gotten lazy on the brushing.  Needless to say, another one has been ordered and is on the way courtesy of prime shipping.

And while you might think that my pup wouldn't know the difference, she doesn't seem as interested in this one as she was in the one that I have in another shape.  Maybe because there is nowhere to grab that isn't pointy?

review/summary: Best Chew Toy for a Lab!
review/text: If you have a lab as a pet, this is a must buy. Sidney, my yellow lab, has had her share of chew toys --beginning with ropes, moving onto squeeky toys, stuffed animals, and tackling all types and sizes of flavored nylabones. And, I haven't mentioned the things she's not supposed to chew (believe it or not, it's bluetooths....that's her favorite alternative). She quickly grew bored off all, but one --Nylabone's Durable Dental Dinosaur. She absolutely loves it!!! And, it's taken her months to break it down. She loves it so much, I purchased one for our home, the dog walker's house, and the car. I don't ever want her to go without it. And, you won't want your dog to go without it either.

Both of my dogs LOVED this bone as soon as it arrived.

If you have smaller dogs who don't have a shepherd's powerful jaw, then this bone is for you.

review/summary: The best for my Super Chewer
review/text: I originally purchased one of these for my puppy when I brought her home.  By six months she had chewed the dino's head and tail off but it was in good shape.  We lost her dino at about 9 months and I found that she was becoming destructive in her chewing.  She can destroy a stuffed animal in 2-3 minutes, sometimes less.  She has a new dino and is very happy.  We tried other chews but they don't have the nubs on them which she seems to enjoy.  I purchases back up dino's in case we ever lose one again.  It's kept her out of trouble with her chewing.  This is a great product.  She is a Cavalier, I would not give this to a large breed dog because I think it would be to small for them.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E6V">Dental Dinosaur Nylabone</a>

They seek these things out and it satisfies the need for a good long gnawing session.

review/text: I'd been eying the Nylabone Dental Dinos in our local pet store for awhile but put off purchasing one for our four month old sheltie figuring it'd be too hard or too heavy for him at such a young age... but then we revived one from my mother (non-dog owner) as a gift for the puppy and he loves it!  It's his favorite chew after the Nylabone Edibles (he's a little glutton) and he can spend hours chewing on it from all angles.<br /><br />He wasn't so keen on it to start out with, but a little playing (hold it out and then pull it back- not mean just to get him to chase it) has turned it into one of his favorite toys.  It's durable, easy to clean and the shape is quite engaging.  He can manipulate it, chew on the various limbs and carry it all around the house.

review/summary: Dog loved it, but it wasn't that durable
review/text: I have a large dog who's normally very soft-mouthed and doesn't destroy his toys -- he has cloth chew ropes and fuzzy animals that are several years old at this point.<br /><br />He went through this dinosaur like an eight-year-old through Christmas morning, though. Chewed it absolutely to bits in just a few weeks, and it came apart into twisted, jagged chewed bits that I feared might present a choking hazard.<br /><br />Might just've been him -- he has strong jaws, he just normally doesn't use them: something about this toy triggered his destructive lust, though. Not sure if that's good or bad from his point of view, but from mine this didn't hold up as well as I was hoping.

review/text: I was so excited to get this toy because it is very cute. We got the Stegosaurus version of the toy, and as soon as I opened the package my dog was just as excited as I was. Up until this point she had been barking at the UPS man who delivered it!<br /><br />This toy says it is designed for active chewers up to 50lbs. My 5 year old Clumber Spaniel is a very active chewer, and weighs 50lbs - I thought it was perfect! However, within twenty minutes, she had chewed it to the point where it looked like a giant wad of used bubble gum.

review/summary: If you want white plastic pieces all over your floor - get it
review/text: After a week of having them..... Really don't care for this product. My dogs (2 4 year old mixed breed) were not excited about them. The girl had her's for all of about 3-4 minutes, then said thanks but no thanks and walked away. The boy chewed for about 7-8 minutes, then had enough. They stayed on the floor for them to enjoy at anytime, but they rarely have. And when they did chew them - well, I had small hard white pieces all over my rug. Needless to say, can't walk barefoot on the rug.<br />Sorry I made this purchase - especially at the price ! I do not recommend this product.

review/text: I have three dogs.  Two cocker spaniels and a jack russell terrier.  None of them like this toy.  They have had several Nylabone toys, but this one is the least favorite.  Each of them tried it out, but they all got bored with it fast.  It is very heavy and the points are somewhat sharp.  That may not be what turns my dogs off though because they have had other textured toys.  After handling it myself, I would be worried about it being to coarse and causing bleeding gums or injuring their teeth.

review/summary: DO NOT BUY- WARNING!!!!
review/text: My wife & I religiously bought dental dinos for our corgi. He is a powerful, obsessive chewer that tore anything else apart that we gave him. He's been through many over the years. Recently, on a routine visit to the vet, they found that both of his molars on top were cracked & infected. They are currently performing root canals on each. If the root canals do not work,they'll have to pull his most important chewing teeth. The vet (who is a dental specialist) said that the injuries were directly related to this product. A $2000 bill and a pup with no molars. Sad day. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT

review/summary: Not impressed and neither was our vet
review/text: We purchased the Stegosaurus at a local pet store the day we adopted our cattle dog mix. At the time she was about 45 pounds and 8 months old. We did not know what kind of chewer she was, but felt that a product designed for "powerful" chewers up to 50 pounds would be a safe choice. It was not. She worked to remove the head and tail of the dino and while we were able to get the larger pieces from her, she swallowed several very small pieces. And much to our embarrassment, at her first vet visit (3 days after adoption) we were told to stop giving her whatever "white plastic" toy she was chewing and eating. Enough pieces had gotten into and through her system to cause the vet concern she may not pass all of them.<br /><br />I am giving this product 1 star because:<br />1) It is described as a product for powerful chewers - it did not hold up<br />2) It is rated for dogs up to 50 pounds - while on the upper end of the scale, our dog fits into that category and the product did not hold up<br />3) the vet warned us to stop using the product as the size and shape of the pieces were potentially harmful to our dog.

review/summary: Broke my dog's tooth!
review/text: I wanted a Christmas gift my Pit Bull Terrier would love, so I got this dinosaur, something different from the regular bones. Long story short, we opened it on Saturday for Christmas, she chewed on it for a half an hour and started whining and excessively drooling. I looked in her mouth and saw she had fractured a canine tooth. My dog was in excruciating pain for two days because of the stupid shape of this bone. She was chewing on it's tail, and it literally broke a slab of her tooth off. The whole tooth had to be removed, costing me $300, and a day off work to get it fixed, not to mention all the pain and anxiety my dog went through. JUST STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE!<br /><br />I've been giving my pitty the Nylabone brand chews since she was little. We've tried the Big Chews, Regular and Wolf size, and even the smaller ones and have never had a problem before this one. She loves the liver and bacon flavors, but I've been hesitant to give her any of these bones since our incident. She loves them though, and they keep her teeth clean.

review/summary: Finally a good Nylabone
review/text: Our Silky Terrier is part dog/part pirana.  We bought a regular Nylabone and it was completely destroyed within a couple minutes.  Huge pieces were torn out of it and swallowed.  I was terrified he would have serious ramifications from it.  I contacted Nylabone immediately and they sent me 3 toys more suitable for my "strong chewer".  One of those was the dental dinosaur durables.  He LOVES LOVES LOVES this toy.  And after 4 months it is now time to replace it (the head and tail are now missing).  I am so please that this toy worked for our pirana dog! :)<br /><br />Other good toys that they sent as replacements were the Nylabone Wishbone and the Nylabone Puzzel Bone.

Now we have a new lab and she loves the natural ones, which she basically wears down slowly.<br />We also had some white nylabones that hadn't been used and our lab almost eats them.  First we saw pieces about the size of 1/4 a rice in her feces.  Then I found her with a piece about the size of a dime in her mouth.  It was irregular and did not look like something that would pass easily.<br />We chucked the white ones and now I'm trying to find the good ones.<br />Not so easy since websites show pictures of both so I'm not certain what we'd get.<br /><br />I would never give my dog these white Nylabones.<br /><br />I did not buy Nylabones here.  I'm searching for a source of the good ones that don't break into large chunks.<br /><br />I asked for advice at the Nylabone site but have not heard from them.

review/summary: Best dog toy purchase I've made
review/text: I was very disappointed in the "regular" Nylabones - my 20 pound dogs chewed them into sharp, dangerous chunks within a matter of minutes.  I was wary of Nylabone products after that, but the durable ones have turned out to be great, and I'll only buy durable from now on.  My dogs like the bone-shaped durable Nylabones, but they LOVE these dinosaurs.  They never seem to get tired of chomping on them.  They do wear down, but slowly and in tiny pieces that appear to be harmless.  After about a month of three dogs working on two dinosaurs, the toys are missing their heads, but there's plenty more to chew on.  Their irregular shape makes them easy to hold onto and fun to go at from different angles.  My house will never be without these things.
