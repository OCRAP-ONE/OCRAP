This stuff tastes great and is actually a healthy addition to the diet, in moderation.<br /><br />Why would anyone continue using the "white death" table salt that is void of so many essential elements?<br /><br />I also use this to make an all-natural facial and body scrub!

review/summary: used to be the best 70% chocolate
review/text: Now that the new "improved" bar is made in NH, USA they seem to think that it has to have soy lecithan and be made for the so called "American taste" as in sweeter and smoother. They really ruined a good thing. When the new version appeared at the local store I bought some and did not tell my family that it was a different ingredient list. The comments went like this: "This isn't the same" "This tastes like a cheap chocolate bar" "Do you have any Lindt 70% chocolate?" and so it went. When my current stash of the old style is gone I will be looking for a new favorite bar. I still find the old style once in a while, but I am afraid that it will be gone for good unless it can be ordered from a European supplier.

Very, very Swiss.<br /><br />I have been enjoying this chocolate bar for the past twenty years in Europe and the USA.<br />We just finished our old stash of Lindt Excellence 70% dark chocolate bars.

review/text: The flavor is now bland and boring (think Hershey Kiss), and the "new and improved" smooth texture reminds me of plasticizers.<br /><br />I spent probably hundreds of dollars on Lindt 70% chocolate bars over the years, but as soon as I tasted the new version, I will never by another Lindt product of any kind until they bring back the old one. Looking at all the other reviews, Lindt has made an identical mistake to Coke of releasing a new version and discontinuing the old one.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if its cheaper to make (soy emulsifier wasn't on the original ingredient list and it tastes like they are using inferior coca), but this bar is an insult to the intelligence of every person who's tried the original.

review/text: Lindt's original recipe was the gold standard of dark chocolate. Mother Temptation's favorite child. But what is success in today's world if it can be exchanged for failure? And failure itself is the success of this new recipe. Lindt soyed the taste to where the experience of flavor is completely overtaken with the question of: "What have I just eaten?" Remember the world in the movie Soylent Green? This is the chocolate for them.

review/text: I'm not sure I'm reviewing exactly the same Lindt 70% bar as shown here, but it's the best match I could find. Here goes:<br /><br />What's good: Silken texture, the Lindt trademark, and strong chocolate flavor.<br /><br />What might be good for some: Intermediate "dark" chocolate flavor, richer than traditional "dark" chocolate, but without the bite of 85% or 90%. Personally, I like the sharp edge that this only hints at.<br /><br />What's not: Vanilla. I meean, I like vanilla, and the warm vanilla musk fills my nose more than with anything else I can remember - including most vanilla ice cream. When I want serious chocolate, though, I find it a floral distraction.<br /><br />Nice, I'll never turn it down, but it's not at the top of my list.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

I'd rather eat a Hershey bar.  No idea what Lindt is thinking.  Their website says they made this change after extensive consumer tests showed folks wanted a "smoother" taste with a "less intense cocoa flavor."  Who on earth would buy a chocolate bar advertising 70% cocoa content and expect it not to be intense?

It's what we grew up with. But they're not going to pay $2 for one in a fancy dancy euro-style package.

I might not be a chocolate expert, but I definitely love good Swiss chocolate and I think this product is great (even though it is made in the USA - by a Swiss company). This stuff tastes great, is not too bitter for a 70% bar and gives me my chocolate fix without sending me into a sugar shock. The reason it melts in warm weather is because it is real chocolate - that's what it does. Anyhow, wanted to put in a good word for my favorite snack.

review/summary: They ruined a Good Choclate Bar!!
review/text: Well, once again a great product has been cheapened in the name of "American taste".  I find it hard to believe that anyone would prefer this "new" recipe that Lindt is using for its Chocolate sold in the USA.  I should of known something was up because I noticed that the Lindt bars were on sale for far too long at the supermarket.  That is often a sign of a product being cheapened some time after an acquisition from a conglomerate or private equity company; Kettle chips come to mind.<br /><br />Those who were previously in charge of marketing and merchandising Lindt bars in the USA had to know that their market was a little more upscale and refined than those who consume a Hershey or a Reeses.  I bet some new (American) management got involved.  That "market taste test" someone referred to is mostly BS; they already knew that Americans in general have unsophisticated child like tastes, that pander to the overly sweet, artificial and creamy.  Sweet artificial and creamy pretty much sums up American food with the exception of meats.  However in the case of meats sweet artificial sauces and fake smoke flavor abound for "dipping"; Americans love their finger dipping food!  Coming off the diatribe, it is clear that Lindt is now more interested in competing with Hershey for the taste of the "average joe".  After all it costs less to produce chocolate for their taste.  So the gamble is this; will they profit more by making a cheaper bar and competing against Hershey for the taste of Joe average or by keeping their quality high and catering to those who know better?  American management is notorious for pursuing the "quick money", and I know this is a pretty audacious assumption but i bet that Lindt hired on a few Americans to run local manufacturing / Marketing and this change is being conducted at their behest.  Short term, these American managers look good (the quick win) because they lowered their cost basis by decreasing production cost.  Long term, American management mostly moved on and Lindt is now a cheapened brand that just barely survives (in the USA) competing with the likes of Hershey.  We shall see, but I will not buy another Lindt product while Stateside.<br /><br />Can anyone advise of an alternative European dark chocolate bar (70-90%) that is reasonably priced and available in the States.  My favorite bar,  Neuhaus is very expensive and limited in terms of availability.

review/summary: A guilty pleasure
review/text: I read a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307460169">cookbook</a> recently where the author, in addition to giving recipes, interviewed famous and influential chefs of all sorts.  One of the questions that the chefs were asked was "What do you eat when no one is watching?"  In other words, what is your guilty pleasure that might not jive with your being a renowned chef.  The answers were honest and amusing.  Although I am only a foodie and not a chef, if I were asked that question my answer would be "Hormel Corned Beef Hash."<br /><br />Fist, let me be honest about what this is: this is not something that you would want to eat very often if you were worried about fat or sodium content; the potatoes are dehydrated; and the corned beef tastes a little like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0025UCGKK">potted meat</a>.  Still, it is a real comfort food for me and I love it.<br /><br />I almost always add some freshly diced onions or shallots.  I also add either diced bell pepper or minced Serrano.  I put in it a hot skillet over medium heat and let it cook until crispy.  I flip it and while the other side is cooking I cook an egg or two in a separate skillet and place them, sunny side up, on top of the hash.  I like to finish it off with a generous dose of hot sauce.<br /><br />I buy this large size when I have guests (I have to admit that not all of my friends or family share my love for this product.)  I also purchase the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S04X4W">15-Ounce</a> and also the 7.5 oz can when it's just for me (and when I'm not having it for my main meal.)  This is something that I always have on hand (I just hide it from my judgmental foodie friends.)  :-)

Cook it in a couple of drops of clean light oil and it'll still taste great but be healthier.<br /><br />I like it cruncy and this crunchs and brownsvery nicely thank you.I may add some ketchup or fresh tomatoes to the side of the plate.<br /><br />I don't see these nice  large cans in the Supermarket --so I am glad I can purchase them here !

I used the Starbucks espresso before this, and before that I had the Lavazza decaf packaged in a green can, I like this one the best.<br />I love the taste, it is not bitter, it smells wonderful, the foam doesn't dissolve after 5 sec which is what happens with the Starbucks espresso.<br />I was very skeptical about buying the product with almost no reviews but it worked out great for me. I'm a coffee lover and I am very particular about it.<br />This is the best Decaf espresso I've had and I highly recommend it. I also like the Lavazza regular espresso the best of all the Espressos I've tried so it may be that I'm a Lavazza fan.<br />Shipping was fast, it got to me way faster than what it said on Amazon and I was thrilled since I had run out of decaf and need it badly.

I understand that ganoderma is a type of mushroom, but I didn't expect it to be so forward. The drink was neither sweet enough to be enjoyable as a lighter chocolate drink, nor rich enough to be a good dark chocolate drink. All in all, I really wouldn't recommend it. I give it two stars because it's not completely undrinkable, but it is close.

review/summary: Best deal on AMZ for bottle pumps
review/text: These pumps are very durable.  I've been using the same pump for over a year for my Torani coffee syrups and have no problem with them whatsoever.  The fit is perfect and I never have syrup running down the side of the bottle. The only thing I make sure I do when changing the bottles is rinsing out the pump as sugar crystals can dry around the pump mechanism and cause the pump to get stuck.  Cleaning is easy:  just let the pump soak in clean, warm water (no soap necessary) and then pump water through it a few times to blast away the remaining sugar residue.  Maintaining these pumps this way prolongs the life of the pump.<br /><br />This five-pack is the best deal on Amazon.  Others sold separately cost more by other shippers because of the added shipping costs.  A five-pack now allows me to keep several bottles of different syrup flavors available to chose from while making my morning cappuccino.

If you pump it full of syrup (2 pumps on mine) before inserting it fully, you won't waste any syrup.

review/summary: Works pretty well on Torani glass bottles
review/text: These pumps fit perfectly on my glass Torani bottles (bought from another site, not through Amazon).<br />I haven't tried cleaning them yet, but in my past experience (working at a coffee shop), they should come clean with a good soaking in warm soapy water (don't forget to pump them to clean the inside & use lots of clean water to make sure you get rid of any soap residue).<br />The only issue I have (& why I gave it a 4 star rating) is that when I first use them on a bottle the syrup tends to spray out a lot from the air in the pump. I'd be okay with that, but it seems to be a problem for longer than it should on some bottles. I'm not sure if the seal is bad on those lids or if those pumps have holes in them somewhere? It may even be an issue with the syrups themselves rather than the pumps (which is why my rating isn't any lower). It's not a big problem since I can just place the glass right up under the pump, but it's not quite as convenient as placing the glass down on the counter. It's still better than using a measuring cup, though, so overall I am happy with these pumps.

review/summary: Great deal for 5 pumps!
review/text: These pumps fit the 25.4oz Torani syrup bottles perfectly.<br /><br />I do want to mention that with a brand new Torani bottle you may want to dispense by pouring the first splash of syrup.  I've had new bottles be so close to full that when placing the pump into them, it caused a slight overflow and spillage.  This was quite a while ago and it may not happen now but pouring new bottles has become habit to avoid any mess.<br /><br />Other than that, I've never had any issues with dripping, clogging or spraying when used.  These are simple to clean and reuseable between bottles.  This truly is a great value for the number of pumps you get with the durability of these pumps.

review/summary: Great deal!
review/text: After purchasing a 6-pack of Torani syrups, I realized pumps would make everything much easier and cleaner. I was ecstatic to find that not only did Torani offer their own brand of pumps, but they were also offered in a multi-pack!<br /><br />The one downside of this is they sell their syrup packs in quantity 6 and the pumps are sold in a pack of 5. No big deal if you don't mind holding out on a flavor to use later on.<br /><br />The pumps feel very durable like they will last many uses. I have almost gone through my pack of syrups, and there is no question the pumps will be used on the next set.<br /><br />This item is highly recommended if you use Torani syrups.

They were a very fair price, and worked perfectly.<br />We did use them with Torani syrups, so of course the bottles and pumps were sized to fit, but I was still very happy with how well they connected - nothing was leaky or made a sticky mess.<br />They are just a good quality, and well-made. They fit well, and have yet to get all jammed up with dried syrup. Why didn't I find these years ago?!?

review/text: These are a must have for syrups.  It makes measuring a lot easier and it eliminates a lot of mess rather than pouring right from the bottle.  My only complaint would be that it's nearly impossible to put a pump into a full bottle of syrup.  It has overflowed every time I have tried.  Other than that, they work great.  Just make sure to clean them regularly :)

review/summary: Use TVP instead of Boca or Morningstar "Crumbles"
review/text: TVP is the same base ingredient used for Morningstar "Crumbles" and Boca "Ground Beef" substitute.  The difference?  Pure TVP doesn't have the HUGE amount of added sodium in the aforementioned products (check the labels), plus it is cheaper.  Also, you don't have to freeze this product, and it will last a long time if stored properly.  All you have to do is rehydrate it and use it.  It takes on the flavor of whatever you are cooking and adds welcome protein to the meal.  For our household, this is a staple product.

review/summary: Much, much better than I expected !
review/text: An avid home cook that is a collector of both cookbooks and cooking gadgets writes this review.  My husband and I have been following the "Eat to Live" plan for about 4 months now.  I purchased this product to give the illusion of meat in my chili and marinara sauce.  Both my husband and I were dubious about how this product would taste and what the texture would be.  We were both pleasantly surprised by this product.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. Very easy to use<br /><br />2. Can be stored in the cupboard while dry<br /><br />3. Texture is very similar to ground meat<br /><br />4. Absorbs the flavor of the sauce it is placed in<br /><br />5. Soy product, which is good for your health<br /><br />6. Good source of vegetable protein<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1. It isn't going to fool anyone that it is beef or pork it used alone, but it does replicate the texture<br /><br />Overall I recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a vegetable protein.  I have used it both in chili and marinara sauce.  I plan to try adding it to my lentil veggie burgers where I think it will work fine.  I have been pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend it to anyone that is trying to reduce the saturated fat that his or her family is consuming.  If you aren't vegan I would suggest that you mix the rehydrated TVP into meatballs, and hamburgers.  I can't imagine that your family would even know that it is there if you used a 50/50 mix.

review/summary: Simple ingredients, works well.
review/text: After trying another brand of TVP (which had some less-than-healthy ingredients), I tried this one.  The only ingredient is defatted soy flour.  I add a handful sometimes to soup or stirfry and it works very well.  It easily soaks up the flavor of whatever I am cooking and adds a very nice texture.

review/summary: Super--Even if you aren't vegetarian
review/text: I never thought I would like this product at all--after all I am not a vegan or a vegetarian.  However, knew I needed more protein, and I thought I would try to use TVP to get additional healthy vegetable protein into my diet.  I now sprinkle it on yogurt, over a bowl of berries, I use it as a binder in my turkey meatloaf instead of breadcrumbs, and I add it to a bowl of cereal.  Using this as a part of a healthy diet helped me to lose 25 lbs in 12 weeks!<br /><br />It has very little taste, but if used in its natural form (right out of the bag) it adds a nice crunch.

review/summary: Not Very Gluten Free.
review/text: This is good basic TVP.  If you have celiac, the canary-in-the-coal-mine-type that reacts to 18 ppm gluten, this is not for you. It will make you sick, or at least uncomfortable.<br /><br />(My theory about Bob's Red Mill, is that they're great if you get their items that are once-milled; you're not getting exposed to the 10 ppm that is probably in the air when they mill other things in the wheat and oat containing part of the mill.)<br /><br />For reference:  I've been gluten-free for eleven years, and I have no other noticeable food allergies, except kiwis and uncooked corn.  I'm pretty sure this has things in it other than soy.

review/summary: Dynamite hot not so hot
review/text: There is nothing better to me than a nice homemade chili. It does take some time to make however so I decided to look for a good canned chili to have on hand when I needed a quick fix and didn't have time to make from scratch. I chose this chili because I like a spicy chili and was drawn to the habanero peppers.<br />First of all, there is no way there are habanero peppers in this chili. I was shocked when I took my first bite and there was almost no heat at all. So the dynamite hot label is extremely misleading. On a heat scale of 1 to 10, I would honestly give this a 1 or 2 tops.<br />The chili also has a strange greasy taste and feel in your mouth when you eat it. After adding hot sauce and cheese,it was not so bad when eaten with tortilla chips. I will eat the other 5 cans doing the same thing but will not eat it out of the can as is.<br />In conclusion, I give it 2 stars because it is edible but not very enjoyable. I will not buy this product again and will look elsewhere for a good canned chili or just make big batches and freeze it.

review/text: First time buying this and won't buy it again. I've tried the low fat Silverado chili and it is just as mild as this one. Difference is it's not loaded with unnecessary lard and I can add my own heat. This one is not the least bit hot. If a company is going to market something as 'Ignited by Habanero' it better have Habanero in it. I've had Campbell's Firehouse Chili and that one is a little bit spicier and has less calories. Still prefer the low fat Silverado though.<br /><br />I'll be giving away the rest of this 6 pack.

review/summary: Interesting taste at first, but now I like it. Perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert
review/text: This Ghirardelli Peppermint Bark chocolate has 3 component to it which makes it taste very interesting as you take a bite at it. Chocolate layer (available in milk or dark or 60% dark), white chocolate layer, and peppermint crust. It's kind of unorthodox to use peppermint (or replace mint) with chocolate (as you might be tired of the peppermint candy cane), but they didn't put too much peppermint crust so it is good. but enough to give the kick of the mint taste (and mintier than the regular mint chocolate)<br /><br />If you like mint or peppermint, there is a good chance that you will like this peppermint bark chocolate (maybe not at the first bite). This is perfect for the holiday time, after dinner and dessert.<br /><br />I like the Dark Chocolate version compare to the Milk chocolate version because the white chocolate layer is already milky and sweet, as well as the peppermint crust, so the dark chocolate will give more balance and reduce the overall sweetness of this chocolate<br /><br />If you like this chocolate, you might want to try the after eight mint chocolate which is also very good. You might also want to try (if you haven't already) the Ghirardelli Mint Chocolate (Dark Chocolate with white mint filling). It's really good.
