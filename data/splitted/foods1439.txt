review/summary: A tasty traditional british soup; Amazon's shipping destroys it
review/text: VERY Good product. Its tasty and its also relatively low cal (check out the nutritional data). Its something served all the time in the UK that most Americans have never heard of. Most of my American friends kind of turn their noses up at the idea of it till I actually have them try it, and then they like it a lot and want to know where they can buy it. This stuff really is very tasty, think of it as being sort of like hot vichyssois only not quite.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY Amazon ships these not bound together in any sort of a secure way, they just put them in a box thats too big, with a few of those air pillow things. The weight of the cans is such that the first time they squash the pillows, the pillows pop, meaning 8 heavy cans are now in a box that is way to big for them flying around and slamming into each other. By the time the product arrives it looks like someone was using it to play kick the can, and the air pillows are now all flat.<br /><br />Food in dented cans does not have the same life expectancy (think days rather than months depending on how bad the dent is), and in fact its important that you eat it right away because botulism can develop and that stuff will kill you.<br /><br />Considering this is not a cheap item, as in seriously not cheap, its really disheartening that Amazon persists in not doing a better job of packing it before shipping. I've ordered it from them 3 times now and each time, the condition of the product is the same. The first time, I called to complain and Amazon reimbursed me for the damaged product but had none in stock to re-ship. The second time, same problem, only this time they still had product, so they reshipped it only again it arrived completely dented -- I was handing out cans to all my friends saying... "here great soup, only eat it in the next day or two 'cause its about to go bad."<br /><br />So the product is a great one, but how Amazon packs it for shipping it destroys it.<br /><br />Edit: April '09, I just noticed a NEW feature on Amazon's page where you check the status of your shipments. There is now a specific link for complaining about bad packing that resulted in a damaged product. YAY! They're listening!

review/summary: DAMAGED GOODS
review/text: Every can you receive will be dented significantly. It is obvious that these were set aside by the vendor as unsellable to the normal markets and grocery stores, and Amazon must have gotten them at a huge discount. They then turn around and sell them on their website. The fact is that damaged cans are supposed to be disposed of or donated to a food bank or shelter. You do NOT sell them. Don't make the mistake I made.

review/summary: Cough NO more
review/text: A friend gave me a few of these to try four years ago.  THEY WORK!  I have tried many different cough drops over the years and most work for a few seconds to a minute or so.  These work for hours.  They are not icky sweet, don't stick to your teeth and probably don't cause cavities, as they are sugar free.  I have been unable to find them in a store near me, so I order on line and love the convenience.

review/summary: Fresh, tasty, herbal/salt blend
review/text: Herbs de Provence can bring many dishes to life. Baked chicken and root veggies are a good place to start, for those who are not familiar with this herb mix. Then expand the horizons by searching all the wonderful online recipes. Winter is coming; it's time to enhance those savory stews and one-pot dishes --- to take the plain to the extraordinary.<br /><br />I personally like this French gray salt and herb combination because I don't like to overdo it with the herbs. I prefer a more subtle flavor. However, if you prefer more herbal punch, you may want to stick with purchasing the herbs alone, or make your own mix, which is quite easy to do. Otherwise, you will be fighting with the salt.<br /><br />If you need to watch your sodium intake, you need to know that this product is heavy on the salt --- and the crystals are very large, so it is easy to over salt your dish. You will be fine, if you make adjustments for salt required for your particular recipe. This is just something to consider, when ordering this combo product.<br /><br />I can attest to the freshness of this product.  Upon opening the glass jar, the fragrance was very potent and lovely. I also prefer having the herbs in a jar with a twist-on-lid.  This will help maintain freshness.<br /><br />All said, I highly recommend this product, with the reservations mentioned. These concerns are manageable. Just remember that this product is predominately salt, with herbs as the secondary enhancement, but the herbs won't go unnoticed.

review/text: These are not the best gluten free brownies I've tried, but they are far and away the VERY best gluten free, casein free, egg free brownies out there.  They have a texture that is a tad light for brownies- more like chocolate cake, but good flavor.  Be sure to either eat them the first day or freeze leftovers.  Like most gluten-free goodies, they become gritty after sitting out for a day.

review/text: My kids LOVE this product!  It can be crumbly, though, so I started pouring the batter into a cupcake pan, and the brownies turned out perfect!  They hold together much better, can easily be frosted and can be kept for days!

Perfect if you are going to cut and serve on a plate with a fork, and again, the taste is awesome!

review/text: These dog treats are great, especially if you have a larger dog who can chew any toy or treat to pieces in a minute.  This treats are tough, I have a pitbull and a boxer mix and they are strong and usually chew through a treat real quick but these last and last and they keep them entertained.  I highly recommend these for all dogs.  Plus the filling isn't gross sticky stuff that leaks out and gets on your carpet like some of those other filled dog treats.

review/text: These bones are my dog's absolute favorite.  He is a SUPER strong chewer, although he only weighs about 60 lbs and is otherwise completely gentle.  It's sometimes hard to find bones and toys for him since he always chews them to bits within 5 minutes.  These bones last him forever, at least 3-4 months at a time.  He loves the filling and will lick it for hours.  Would recommend these bones to any large dog owner.

review/summary: Hard Candy by Werther's
review/text: I learned that many people thinks the world of these hard candies. I know the person I bought it for gets kind of emotional when describing the quality imbedded on each and every one. Creamy, delightfully caramelly (I know its not a word but just had to throw it in) and buttery. Enough to make me, for one, shy away from them. I rather have a soft toffee with those qualities than hard candy, but since it is not me but the happy recipient of this bag that I am basically speaking for, I have no choice but to rate it at 4 Stars. There are definitely a little more expensive at the candy aisle but since its rewards are in the taste department must oblige and give them credit for that. Yes, Big Mama is so happy. Who cares if she has lost all her teeth and replaced with new fake ones, candy is an addiction she will never control while on God's Green Earth and since she has already paid a dear price for her vice and will not be deterred from her chosen path of candy please more candy, I have to give Werther's Original Hard Candies, 34-oz. a serious 4 Star rating, for even though it represents all that can go wrong with the world of teeth, specially if consumed every hour of the day including sleeping time can and will cause irreparable damage to the point that they will simply fall off, who can tell such an avid fan that perhaps some healthy fruit might replace that powerful craving? Certainly not me, I tried several times and failed each one. Big Mama is happy with 2 or 3 of these morsels at the same time and like a doctor once told us: if it keeps her happy we will worry about the rest later! 4 Sweet Stars!

review/summary: Absolutely Awful Cat Food
review/text: I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy they catchy jingle from the commercials. My cats did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first three ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are chicken by-product meal, corn gluten meal, and ground yellow corn. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. Basically, corn is just a filler and causes pets to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more (more for us to clean in the litter box), and retain less nutrients. Most inexpensive low-quality foods have lots of these fillers and cheap ingredients with little to no nutritional value. The only meat in Meow Mix at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful cat food. I suppose you get what you pay for. I recommend to stay far away from Meow Mix, as it is simply a very low quality food. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat meat, and there just isn't real meat in this food. High-quality foods tend to be more nutritionally dense, meaning you will be feeding a much smaller amount for the same number of calories. If you do the math to figure out the cost for the number of calories you need to feed your pet, many premium foods are CHEAPER than the awful crap you're buying at the grocery store. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself- provided that you eat a typical (non vegetarian or other restricted) diet. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo, Wellness or Natural Balance. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or corn.

review/text: I have a 15 year old gray short hair kitty who is prone vomiting hairballs. Anyone who has been awakened at night with the sound of a cat throwing up a hairball or has found one staining their nice wood floor in the morning knows how annoying this can be. Not to mention how stressful for the poor cat. The Meow Mix hairball formula seems to help a whole lot with her problem. I've tried giving her a wide variety of other dry food, some supposedly very healthy and expensive, but I always go back to this product because it works. I vary her diet with wet food twice a day and let her nibble on the dry food when she wants. She looks terrific. My other cat is 13 and eats the same diet, she is also very healthy.

I felt lied to as my bottle was not USDA organic but had some obscure international rating. Sorry, I don't trust the Chinese to raise truly organic plants or run a clean, organic processing and packaging operation. Further, the best organic garlic comes from California so why import such an easily obtainable item?<br /><br />Amazon's sales blurb above says this is a USDA organic product -- I assume they are correct. Let's hope so. However, it's the manufacturer who supplies the sales info, not Amazon, so this product might come from China afterall.<br /><br />I want USA organic food that is grown, processed, and packaged under USDA supervision.

review/summary: "Organic" garlic from China?
review/text: Skip eating questionable food from China and demand USA grown food. You can get garlic grown in the USA at your farmer's market. You can also get it from farmers online and distributors such as: spicesinc.com. Or you can search under "garlic not grown in China" like I did. It does exist.<br /><br />Please join me in encouraging Amazon to get an organic source of garlic that is from the USA; they currently have none. Let's help our own economy and not buy food from communist China.<br /><br />UPDATE 1/14/12: spicesinc.com carries USA garlic whenever possible, but they can't always find it. When I wrote the review, they had it in stock. I spoke with Greg, the CEO, today and he is searching for more USA sources. Just call to verify when you place your order.<br /><br />Another way to search the internet is to list a state such as: "California organic garlic powder".

review/summary: I swear it's the healthiest anywhere!
review/text: The food this company makes is the closest I can find to raw until I actually get to feed mine raw more often. The value is amazing... actually because it is so dense with nutrients, my cats eat less and I spend less feeding them this brand of food than the other premium brands I was feeding them before.<br /><br />They love the flavor, their coats are magnificent! Their stools are small and odorless, similar to what it would look like if they were on a raw diet. My oldest cat who had mild digestive issues doesn't have them anymore. Hooray! I also noticed that while on this brand of food, the crusty sleepies in their eyes are just about non-existent. I hardly have to groom their faces anymore. And they are so active I can hardly believe they have that much energy for their ages.<br /><br />I honestly believe that having no synthesized vitamins makes a world of difference. I had to go back to my old brand of kibble for a short time because I was waiting for my next Nature's Logic order to arrive. On their old brand the cats were producing so much extra waste and it wasn't nearly as healthy-looking. The difference really is amazing. There is no doubt to me the Nature's Logic foods are truly easy to digest and the nutrients are absorbed and used! I hope they continue to grow and the product becomes more well known and available.<br /><br />Pros : Improves Coat, Increased Activity, Good Value, Likes It, All Natural, Good Taste, Nutritional, Easy To Digest, Odorless Stools<br />Cons : Few Flavor Selections

I quickly purchased their coffee to bring home.  When I ran out, I searched the internet for the same brand they served - Sidamo Ethiopia Decaf Coffee and found a great company Orleans Coffee Exchange on Amazon.  I have ordered (usually 10 bags, at a time) on multiple occasions and I am always surprised and happy how quickly and efficiently it is delivered.  After trying Decaf Ethiopia Sidamo, I canceled my monthly order with Illy!

review/summary: My dogs love it!
review/text: I am so glad Amazon had our brand! After our distributor went out of business, I couldn't find Hi-Tek anywhere! We switched our two Cattle dog mixes to Hi-Tek from Blue Buffalo after it made our 9-year-old gassy. This food is all natural and made in America (even the packaging is made in the USA) and I can get a huge bag of Hi-Tek for $20 less than other natural brands in the pet store with Amazon's free shipping. When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!<br /><br />I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek! Natural food on a budget.

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.

review/summary: Tasty, drier than other brands
review/text: These 6 oz packs of organic California prunes have more flavor than the non-organic brands. They are also drier and firmer, which I wasn't sure I liked at first. I quickly grew used to it and now I prefer them this way. They are sweet and chewy.<br /><br />The freshness date is 16 months in the future, so these would make a good addition to any emergency preparedness stock one might have.<br /><br />You can't go wrong at this price for 12 bags. This is one brand you can trust<br /><br />Update 10/31/10  I bought some more of the prunes recently and they are not dry and firm anymore. Now they seem like they've been steamed because they are very moist and the inside of the bag has prune gunk stuck to the sides. If you stick your hand in the bag, it will come out pruned, so I use a fork.  They taste fine, but I was a little taken aback when I first opened them.

review/summary: Nice price...but sadly, not potent ...:(
review/text: I purchased these mushrooms after taking cordyceps for about a year.  Previously, I was supplied by my father who always ordered them online from Mushroom Harvest.  I figured that this price was better so I decided to buy my own.  I should also state that I take them for 2 specific reasons.... 1. They eliminate my allergies and 2.  They significantly  help my endurance.  I gave half of the NEW cordyceps to my father and kept the other half for myself.  At first, I thought that perhaps it was me because I did not feel any effects at all.  I took them exactly as I had in the past for 2 weeks and sadly, my allergies resurfaced which prompted me to be extremely tired.  I had some of my OLD Mushroom Harvest cordycep supply from my dad so I took a teaspoon.  Within that day, my allergies cleared which indirectly effected my energy level.  I was back to running/gym and my regular work routine at my usual pace.  I did not want to believe that these mushrooms were not potent so I would still take the NEW ones periodically for a week at a time.  At one point, I even tried increasing the dosage..... but still rendered the same disappointing results.<br /><br />  Months later, I mentioned the differences in mushrooms to my father.  He said that he noticed the same effects or lack there of but did not tell me to avoid offending me since I bought/gave them to him. :(  He had already ordered himself more cordyceps from Mushroom Harvest.  I had to do the same thing which bothered me because somehow no matter how old I get, he is always RIGHT!!!!!!!<br /><br />  I really wanted these cordyceps to be effective and am sadly disappointed that they were kind of a waste............ On a positive note, the Kismet Kreations Cordyceps came in a timely fashion and had a nice hand written thank you on the invoice!!!! :)<br /><br />P.S. No, I am definitely not an endorser for Mushroom Harvest.... If anyone can tell me where to get equally potent but less expensive Cordyceps, please let me know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)

You have to wiggle it back and forth to cut just a simple potato while applying pressure.  It slips and then your potato is half down the cutter on one side and mostly at the top on the other then you have to slam it on the table to get it to half straighten back and and you're left with a wavy potato (not in a good way) and parts of it are still stuck in the cutter.  Then you're trying to get those pieces out and you cut yourself.  It's just AWFUL don't buy it.

review/text: I have just received a fresh supply of the Ice Breakers Wintergreen gum. You all have been a source of great relief to me. This is the only gum my husband likes and I used to have to drive all over town trying to find it. Everybody it seems quit carrying it. When I asked about it I would just get some blank stares and an unsatisfactory answer. So I started searching for the gum else where and there you were. I am so very thankful to have found you and have been able to keep my wonderful husband supplied with his favorite gum. The only problem I have is that there are times I come online to order and discover you out of stock, then I begin to worry...but lo and behold it isn't long before you have them if only a limited amount. I know once I click the order button Joe will be getting his gum shortly. I have it gets here pretty quickly. Thank you for being there and keeping us supplied....please, keep this stock going into the future, you will have a loyal customer in our online orders.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CH21U4">Ice Breakers Gum - Wintergreen, 15 stick packs, 10 count</a>

review/summary: Dogs love them, and so do I!
review/text: Dogs love these delicious treats. Essentially, Pup-peroni is a SlimJim for dogs. It's a thin, soft meat stick that tastes absolutely delicious, and a package of these is far cheaper. I haven't yet seen or even heard of a dog that refuses Pup-peroni. I usually go with the 25 oz. twin pack advertised here on Amazon because I tend to indulge once in a while too. I know they're for dogs, but SlimJims are expensive, and like I was saying before, these are comparable.<br /><br />In any case, these aren't the healthiest treats for anyone, canine or human. I would recommend giving them to your hound in moderation. Furthermore, as delicious as Pup-peroni is, it will destroy a dog's breath. I, for one, won't curl up on the couch with any dog that has eaten these beforehand nor will a dog curl up with me if I've eaten one.<br /><br />I have yet to try any flavor besides the traditional beef sticks, but the bacon ones sound extrememly promising. Eat and enjoy!

review/text: I'm a velveeta lover, don't get me wrong, I like 'real' cheese too.. but Velveeta is handy to have in the fridge for grilled cheese or a quick hot dish and, unopened, can be kept in the pantry.<br /><br />Ordering three at a time, delivered to my door, was a convenience and a great help when our car was acting up and would be a while to fix. This gave me some meal options to go with food already stashed in the pantry and freezer to jazz things up a bit...<br /><br />I just ordered a second pack to keep a good stash in the pantry... I prefered to be prepared.. you never know what might happen, ya know??<br /><br />The packages were well packed and arrived promptly, in perfect condition...not so much as a scuff mark or crease in the cartons.

review/summary: Pretty nice
review/text: The product consists of an approximately 10 inch (25 cm) long piece of meat with 1 or 2 smaller (approx 1 1/2-2 inches, 3-5 cm) pieces thrown in.  The meat is about 1/4 inch (6-7 mm) thick and comes in a fairly easy, peel open package.  Taste is good though on the salty side (it carries more than 1/2 the daily recommended amount of salt).  It does not actually taste like steak, just jerky, but the meat is pretty tender and I didn't feel like I was wrestling with shoe leather.  I appreciate the fact that the pepper bits are not "loose" like some other jerkies, so crumbs are not much of a concern.  Per the box, store in a cool, dry place.<br />Nutritional info:<br /><br />Servings per container: 1<br />Calories: 120<br />Total fat: 2g (3%)<br />Saturated fat: 1g (5%)<br />Trans fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 50 mg (17%)<br />Sodium: 1360 mg (57%)<br />Total carbohydrates: 4g (1%)<br />Dietary fiber: 0g<br />Sugars: 2g<br />Protein: 22g

Instead, it is mild. Still really good, however! One word of caution, although it's addictive, eat in moderation, or your sodium levels will be off the chart.

review/text: After trying the teriyaki flavor of these beef steaks, I decided I would try another flavor so I ordered these peppered ones.  The flavor is really like throwing a salt and pepper shaker into your mouth.  You never really get a chance to taste the meat since your tongue is overwhelmed by this cloyingly salty, stale pepper flavor.  The worst part? There is 1470mg of Sodium in a single package, which is a whopping 61% of your daily value of sodium for the ENTIRE day.

review/summary: Good snack!
review/text: Have order three boxes in total now. I bring one as a snack to work almost everyday. Soooo much cheaper to order from Amazon than to buy at a gas station. Some reviews say they've had 'moldy' packages. So far I've only had one single package that tasted a little off. The rest of the box was fine. Some jerky strips will have a bit of congealed grease on them, I just wipe it off. Perhaps those folks with the 'moldy' packages were mistaking grease for mold? I will continue to buy this product from Amazon and will always have a box on hand in my pantry. (Oh, of note, these strips are made from WHOLE strips of beef, not the "chipped, chopped, pressed and pattied" variety, and it is very lean. Lots of protein and only 70 calories a package. 'Beats a package of potato chips any day! They are a tad salty, but so are potato chips - and I always have something to wash them down with too!)

review/summary: Eww
review/text: These things are terrible.  They have a waxy coating and some sort of chemical on top.  The taste of the chemical is very prominent.  I can't even give these things away.

review/summary: Good price, and just the right size
review/text: These are perfect for my bf and myself. They are perfect size for a snack or for myself I have sugar issues so this is a good source of protein when my sugar is getting low. For the price and when you do the subscribe and save it is even better. They work great on the go or just when you need a quick snack and the flavor is tasty!
