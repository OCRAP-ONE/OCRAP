review/summary: YUCK !!!
review/text: I am compelled to warn you coffee lovers out there.  I read the reviews of so-called coffee aficianados regarding this particular brand.  I believed that organic coffee has to be better than the others I've tried just because of how its grown.  Not so, buyer beware.  This is the absolute worse coffee I have ever had the displeasure of polluting my palate.  I now believe that the first reviewer must have some personal stake in this brand, or some of your taste buds have been dulled.  I tried to return this product [[ASIN:B000GAO9WO Caffe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown Espresso Roast, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)to Amazon, but was told that food items are non-refundable. My spouse and I tried to drink this coffee and after having 3 bags of this sludge in our cabinets, we finally decided to throw it away.  I thought of re-gifting to friends, but I like and want to keep my friends.  The only thing this coffee can possibly compliment is the garbage.  It's just so wrong that it sucks so bad.

review/summary: A Tasty Expresso for Iced Coffee
review/text: I enjoy this coffee for iced coffee: it is really gooooood!  Cafe Appassionato Organic Shade Grown has a nice roast on the beans.  The flavor is strong,smooth and doesn't dilute with ice.  I drink it black so taste is really important, and this product holds up!  It is also important that the beans are organic and shade grown(supporting the ecology and farmer coops).

review/summary: Not for espresso
review/text: I own fairly decent espresso equipment, an Astra Gourmet machine and a Mini Mazar grinder.  Regardless of the setting of the machine and grinder the espresso was terrible. Burnt taste, bland and bitter.  The grounded coffee looks and smells burnt.  I suppose that the beans are roasted incorrectly for espresso.  I never had espresso this bad not even from beans that cost half the price.  I have tried to use this coffee in a drip machine the result is acceptable however in my opinion the generic coffee sold by Costco for that purpose is comparable and much cheaper.  I have purchased this coffee based on the many positive Amazon reviews, only after buying I checked the negative reviews and realized that in the future I should start reading negative reviews first...

review/summary: An excellent espresso bean -- no matter how you make it!
review/text: We make our espresso using either a french press or our Saeco "Easy" Automatic Espresso machine. These beans are full-flavored and deep, making excellent after dinner coffee. We use a rotation of Altura Sumatran Dark roast, Altura Biodynamic French Roast and Altura Peruvian<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSPX7C">Caf&eacute; Altura Organic Coffee, Sumatran Dark Roast, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSTYBS">Caf&eacute; Altura Organic Coffee, Biodynamic French Roast, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSTY86">Caf&eacute; Altura Organic Coffee, Peruvian Dark, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a> to keep our taste buds alive at breakfast, saving our espresso roast for after dinner.<br />Given that our Saeco will always make the first cup of coffee from what ever bean was last in our machine, one cup of espresso will be made with one of our breakfast coffees before the just added beans reach the grinder. So we have a daily comparison of "real" espresso with other dark roasts.  There is a difference! This bean makes excellent espresso! At breakfast we split the first cup (which will be made with the prior night's beans)combined with our breakfast coffee of the day. In summer, we make our after dinner coffee in a French Press outside to save running back and forth from the kitchen. Again, excellent coffee!<br />We have tried Starbucks espresso, and once used Green Mountain coffees in our rotation, as well as myriad supermarket offerings before we began buying from Amazon's "Subscribe and Save". This bean makes great coffee and you can taste the difference! It's not, as one reviewer suggested, just a another dark-roast coffee!

review/summary: Unbelievably nice!!
review/text: i guess the title sums it all up. I like to consider myself a slight "coffee snob" but, i don't own a roaster (nor have the time really to roast my beans). Although i woud love to do so at some point. Anyhow, somehow i stumbled upon these beans here at Amazon and after reading the reviews, decided to give them a whirl.  I was pleasantly shocked at how fantastic they really are.<br /><br />Normally i would order the Vesuvio blend from Batdorf and Bronson which is a great espresso blend but, runs almost twice the price for 32 oz of beans. The Appassionato though cheaper and also the fact that for about 60% of the Batdorf price i get a little more weight in beans, is superior by far.  It is very smooth and clean, grinds wonderfully and it provides a wonderful crema.<br /><br />We use a gaggia carezza machina and a breville conical burr grinder (not the greatest burr grinder but, it does the job well enough).

review/summary: Good Coffee, Bad Espresso!
review/text: These beans are not meant for your espresso machine!<br /><br />Caffe Appassionato beans are roasted very dark and are oily just like a French Roast.  I would not be surprised one bit if this is French Roast.  I think many Americans like Dark Roasted Coffee because they are used to drinking crappy burnt drip coffee that sits on the burners too long.  This coffee has absolutely no character what so ever.  My opinion is that its way too dark and taste burnt.<br /><br />The espresso shots brewed very unevenly.  I pulled a double shot in separate cups on my Expobar espresso maker and ended up with one cup having a significant more espresso than the other.  The beans were ground very evenly in my Gaggia burr grinder at setting 4 just like any other bean I've used for espresso.  There was barely any crema!  I will try a coarser ground the next time around just to see if I can pull a more even shot.<br /><br />I prepare several shots per day on my Expobar Espresso Machine, have experimented with numerous varieties of beans over the past 3 years of owning this machine and have always made excellent espresso drinks.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with Caffe Appassionato.<br /><br />Caffe Appassianato Espresso Roast makes a good cup of coffee in the french press but these beans are the worst for espressso.  4 stars as coffee, 1 star as espresso.<br /><br />If you want to buy espresso beans here on Amazon, go with Lavazza.  They have a $17 bag that is very good.  I just ordered another bag of Lavazza after tasting my first shot of Caffe Appassionato.<br /><br />Don't let all of the 5 star reviews fool you, this is not espresso!<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Good Coffee
review/text: I live in a rural area, and I could not find any shade grown, fair trade, organic coffee in our local stores. I am happy with this coffee. It has a rich, non-bitter flavor. I'm not a coffee snob, but I do like it better than the espresso I was using before. I really like that I can have it shipped every two months automatically, and it costs about the same as what I was buying locally. Good coffee, good price and I feel better using a fair trade organic product.

review/text: I've had this coffee on automatic re-order for over a year now.  The subscribe and save price...makes this coffee a bargain, when you consider it's shade grown AND organic.  Better than Sbux espresso roast by far...and getting three bags at once (in a house where the morning just won't start without as strong cup of coffee) means we have coffee all month.  (It's comparable to Black Cat Espresso Roast.)<br /><br />Great deal.  Good coffee.  Good for the earth and the people who grow the coffee.  (Yay shade grown!  Save the rainforests!) After 17 months...I'm not tired of it in the morning.

review/text: I have had the fortune to dine in the best restaurants in America and all over Europe. I have also had training by some of the finest chefs (primarily French, Italian and Indian, with some training in Catonese cookery). My taste buds are spoiled, at worst, and highly-refined, at best.<br /><br />Coffee is crucial to my health and the my aesthics. THIS COFFEE answers all my needs. I am highly cricitcal, and use only the best (Kitchen=Aid) Grinder... French Press only. This coffee welcomes me, every morning, as much as I hate waking, welcomes me to the day. The beans are, as they should be, oily, dark, and produce a perfect cup. Though, I might add, I often blend them with other select beans I have found at local organic markets.<br /><br />But lacking a blend, these beans stand on their own. I've bought others online, and found them dry, lacking, etc. These beans have proven consistent in top quality, for a very hard to please palate.<br /><br />If you like a good, serious cup of coffee, especially if you ascribe to my style, grind your own, brew withing minutes and consume, I cannot imagine that your response will make anyone less than a devoute customer.<br /><br />Timothy

The shower has already passed, so I ended up having to buy 20 bags of M&Ms to get the amount of red ones that I needed. It is not a very popular color in the mixed bags. The seller states that the order is on the way, and therefore, I cannot cancel it. Now I am stuck with a ton of multi-colored M&Ms and a maybe a bag of red ones and I had to pay $20 in addition to the $10 that I originally paid. Overall, this experience was horrible, due to the extremely slow shipping. Also, when I ordered the M&Ms, it said that they would be delivered in 5-7 business days, and I never received a notice that they were out of stock or on back order.

review/summary: Not a premium cat food
review/text: My cat loves this food, I don't. I thought it was a premium cat food, and for the price it really should be, but looking at the ingredients label revealed it to be full of the same rubbish that supermarket brands have. It probably is better quality than most supermarket food, but it still contains all the things cat food shouldn't. My cat is just going to have to get used to eating the good stuff!

review/summary: ROHS packaging & food safety
review/text: This raw organic cacao powder came in one of those electronics static bags you'd normaly see a chipset or hard drive with a recycle symbol 7 & 11-PET, ALU, PE. I was told it was "food-safe" by the seller and that "nestl&eacute; uses the exact packaging."I don't see how ROHS (the restricted use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment) can be food safe. I cannot return it for a full refund as there is a restocking fee and shipping charge so I'm writing this review.<br />  At the least, common sense should tell you that organic powderd foods should not be in contact with impregnated aluminum plastics--especially when it's stamped on the bag itself stating (ROHS compliance) "that it contains the minimum acceptable levels of hazardous substances such as cadmium, mercury, and lead." This is no joke. Industry cares not about your health and therefore uses recycled materials containing these hazardous metals. A packaging containing acceptable levels of hazardous materials for a landfill is not food safe!!

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: Like the other 1-star buyer, this powder was shipped to me in a ULINE static shield bag which indicates that it is "ROHS Compliant." ROHS compliancy means that certain metals are banned from being used in packaging, but not necessarily lead! There is no indication this bag was not used previously for electronics, there is no origin marking anywhere on the bag and there is no nutrition label. There also is no "organic" label on the bag aside from a shoddily printed sticker that says "Organic Herbal Essence". Because of all of this I can not be sure this product is not adulterated, let alone organic. I will not purchase this product again from this seller and suggest that other buyers beware. The product itself may be fine, but why take a chance (especially if you are looking for what is supposed to be an 'organic' product free of contaminants)?<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/12:<br />I complained about the improper packaging and submitted photo evidence of the static shield bags to both the seller and Amazon. Originally the seller claimed the product was shipped in food-grade ULINE bags, but after I sent photo evidence to the contrary I heard nothing further from the seller. Amazon granted me a full refund today. If you do order this product, I recommend you double-check that the packaging is safe before opening it!

review/text: The chocolate flavor of it is quite light compared to what I'm used to. However, I haven't been doing the raw thing for too often, so I don't know if that is just a consequence of it being raw and I may not be used to that. I'm going to look around and get some opinions on others, but I will probably come back to this one because the price is great, and it DOES make things chocolatey. . . just not like I'm used to.

review/summary: WOW for flavor
review/text: I was not sure what to expect with cacao versus processed cocoa. The first thing I made I put to much powder in, alot to much...lol. The second thing I made...yup, to much again. My kids and I are loving this stuff. They are much more willing to drink homemade raw almond and rice milk with a bit of cacao and honey in it. And...so exciting...my 12 year old drank her green smoothie this morning with no fuss at all. She told me that if I would let her drink chocolate almond milk, she could handle raw vegan, but she had to have milk to drink that she enjoyed. This is definitely a new pantry staple, and the fact that it is nutritious just sweetens the decision.

review/summary: Hard to believe that this cacao powder is raw
review/text: Raw cacao is bitter, there is absolutely nothing bitter about this stuff.  I have to wonder if the lack of bitterness means that it has been alkalized.  I'm also not to thrilled about their packaging.<br /><br />Edit: I just bought some alkalized (i.e. Dutched) cocoa to compare the taste.  The two products have very very similar tastes.  The Saaqin caccao is not raw, it is a very highly processed cocoa.

review/summary: Really nice product
review/text: Aside from the fact that this product is so reasonably priced and that the delivery was very prompt (about 4 days before the estimated delivery date), it has a really nice flavor for being "raw". I had tried one other brand before and it was quite bitter tasting. This cacao tastes fresh, and when mixed with a fruit, walnut and greek yogurt salad for dinner as well as with a hefty morning smoothie (loaded with raw, organic hemp powder and kefir, etc.),it lends a really delicious chocolate flavor. I use 2 tablespoons with the smoothie and 1 tablespoon with the fruit 'n nut salad. It is recommended that you get at least 3 tablespoons a day of the cacao to maximize its benefits.

review/text: I think they call it "cacao" as opposed to "cocoa" when it's less processed and more pure or something.... this is good stuff: very pure and chocolatey. Not positive it's much better than your standard cheap cocoa powder, but it seems that it was processed without any junk and it's organic.

review/text: I'm not a fan of hot candy really, but have to give these a five star rating! Actually they are not that hot. They have just the right amount of heat and are dusted with a sugary coating for extra yummy goodness. They're delicious and totally addicting! There is something about the gumminess, the heat and the sugar that adds up to make a wonderful combination. I use to be able to find them in candy shops sometimes but now the only place I can find them is online. I usually order these around the holidays every year. The only problem I have with them is I can't stop eating them. Yum!

review/text: If you like cinnamon bears, try these and you will never want the ones at the nearest convenience store again.  They are to the other cinnamon bears what the authentic jelly bellies are to the stale grocery store imitation.  Amazon should set up a subscription order for these as they will be arriving at my  house monthly.  Also, I know they are costly, but due to their intensity and the satisfaction of something that truly sates your appetite you will eat a lot fewer (which in essence makes them much lower in calories per serving than the poor imitations. Also, they do not contain high fructose corn sweetener (just regular sugar and corn syrup).

Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

review/text: Another non-diet food with artificial sweetener.  I tasted the bitterness of the sucralose, checked the label and sure enough,it was there at the end.  The first ingredient is SUGAR, why ruin it?  Skip this unless you're not on a diet, love sucralose, and not a chocolate lover.  Gross.

review/summary: Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product
review/text: I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn"t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!

review/text: Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/text: This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/text: I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

review/text: My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.

review/summary: Good hot cocoa mix, but....
review/text: I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".
