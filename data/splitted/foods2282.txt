review/text: I have put 3 stars because my dogs are old and don't like cookies.  I'm sure other people have had a better response from their pets.  I didn't check the product description well enough to notice it.  Even broken up into bits, my boys leave them sit.  I guess it's back to jerky made for humans, so that I have a little USDA inspecting to make sure it's not Chinese poison.

review/summary: Disappointed, Brownie does not like it at all
review/text: I figured this would be great since Brownie loves Salmon, but he doesn't even want to touch it.  I got him the Salmon and sweet potato one. He'd rather eat regular dog food than this which is quite weird for him.  He eats everything he can get his paws on, including non edible stuff. It might be because the smell is not very strong.  When I put it up close to my nose to smell it, I barely got a light whiff of salmon. Dog treats usually have a stronger smell which makes it more tempting for dogs.

review/summary: Pretty Good Treats
review/text: These are hard treats shaped like hearts that you can break in half if necessary. They have decent ingredients though I try not to give my dogs anything with grain, the oatmeal and barley flour is not too bad. I only give one a day as a late night snack. My Doberman likes them but she is not too picky. My picky Shar-pei will eat them but is not enthusiastic about them (he prefers Merrick sausages). Overall, these are a decent snack for dogs as long as your pet does not have dental issues, these should be okay for them.  I want to make a comment about the packaging. This is one of the few "zip-loc" type resealable bags that actually reseals without having to mess with it a bunch of times. It stays nice and tight and keeps the treats fresh.

review/summary: small - not medium - sized treats
review/text: I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog.  When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6.  Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats.  Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item.  I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats.  I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium.

review/summary: Good Treats
review/text: My dog loves these, and I believe (and hope not to be disappointed) that the Newman's Own Organics brand is to be trusted.<br /><br />The treats are small, and no doubt healthy, but I wish they listed the calories on their package. The ingredients are all good, but I'm trying to control my older dog's weight, and if these were very high-calorie, I wouldn't feed them to her. I'd look for something else. (I know, carrots and other veggies, but she won't eat them. She's a 9 year old rescue with terrible teeth, and set in her ways. My past puppies found baby carrots a great treat, but not this girl.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll contact the manufacturer and ask for the calorie count. But I do think it should be on the package.

review/summary: A Caution
review/text: My three dogs really love these treats.  They are made in the USA and reasonably priced.  One word of caution - I use these to stuff a "Waggle" bone and let my Dal go at it.  He loves it, but if he lays down with the Waggle on a light colored rug, the crumbs that fall out will discolor the rug if they get wet.  No big deal as the discoloration seems to wash out just fine.

In a sense, it's a liquid campfire.<br />It is indeed a strong tea but some of its edge can be knocked down with the addition of a little honey, cinnamon, or perhaps even a marshmallow-flavored syrup.

review/summary: Not enjoyable
review/text: I have used sugar-free Da Vinci syrups in coffee, protein shakes, and cheesecakes without much of a problem, but for some reason the Sugar-Free Pumpkin Pie Syrup had a horrible aftertaste. Very Splenda-y. The pumpkin pie flavor didn't really shine through, either. I could sort of tastes the spices, but they weren't very rich or appetizing. If you want to make pumpkin pie coffee, use a Da Vinci sugar-free syrup of another flavor, like plain, vanilla, French vanilla, hazelnut, etc., and then add a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (usually sold at grocery stores all year round), as well as a splash of heavy cream. I make a no-sugar-added pumpkin pie-inspired cheesecake with pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice only and the taste is much more reminiscent of a real pumpkin pie than this syrup.

review/summary: not starbucks but close
review/text: I always look forward to holiday season just for the pumpkin spice lattes from Starbucks. I have tried many syrups in pumpkin spice flavor. So far this one is the closest. I have also mixed some of the pumpkin spice creamer from coffee mate, with it it's almost a perfect match. I would recommend this but don't use too much and you might want to mix it with a vanilla flavor syrup also.

review/summary: da vinci sugar free pumpkin pie syrup

review/summary: For Mixed Drinks Only
review/text: I've been a fan of the original Starbucks VIA Colombian since its release, and had been keeping a close eye on my local retailer for the flavored varieties to be released, which they have inexplicably stocked roughly two weeks before the release date.<br /><br />The notably larger and heavier packages are sold alongside the original VIAs, featuring only six servings per pack. VIA fans will note the "lightly sweetened" remark on the front of the box, along with the addition of cane sugar in the ingredients list. The packaging is otherwise nearly identical to the standard VIAs, so you'll have to look closely to notice it.<br /><br />Mocha VIA dissolves quickly, much the same way as the original VIAs, but with a slightly milky hue. The mocha-coffee aroma is present, but the actual flavor of the coffee differs notably from the smell; both the coffee and mocha components are low-grade, with the sugar element coming in quite strong ("lightly sweetened" means the same thing here as it does with Iced VIA - almost as sweet as soda.) The overall impression is office-quality bitter coffee with some condiment chocolate powder thrown in and a remarkably heaping spoon of sugar.<br /><br />This does not mean that Mocha VIA is useless; part of what made the original VIAs so popular was how many different ways they could be used in mixed drinks (VIA dissolves in cold water/milk/etc as well as hot), and I would wager that over time, there will be a sizable list of unique mix recipes for these flavored varieties as well. But without those recipes, most Starbucks fans who expect a rather complex quality blended coffee drink will be disappointed by trying to drink this straight.

review/text: I religiously ordered my caramel macchiato every day around 3:52p. But now that I'm a mother and work from home the Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee are my practical substitution because: 1) I don't have the extra time to go to Starbucks and 2) a line item for espresso drinks is not in my budget -along with my heels and fun outfits have been replaced by diapers and more diapers.  BUT what gets me through that sorrow is my new love for Starbucks VIA Ready Brew Flavored Coffee. These ready brew sticks conveniently fit my bill - just as delicious as my caramel macchiato (especially when I add my own steam milk and caramel syrup to the vanilla or caramel flavored coffee).  If it weren't for these beverage sticks, I'd be dragging my poor child to Starbucks at 3:52p every day regardless if it's her nap time or not.  They are just THAT delicious!

I used to drink caramel macchiatos regularly but gave them up when I eliminated dairy and soy from my diet. The caramel VIA packets fill that void more conveniently, with less calories and at a fraction of the cost.<br /><br />I wish the packets were scored better for easier opening like the unflavored packets. But seriously, grabbing a pair of scissors to cut the packet is a lot easier than loading a 10-month old into the car for a trip to our local Starbucks.

review/text: I'm surprised to be in the minority on this, but the Vanilla flavor of VIA is just too sweet.  It tastes like liquefied marshmallows.  I couldn't even finish the first cup, and I also gave one to a colleague with the suggestion to add a little extra water and maybe a little milk to dilute the shock of syrupy coffee, but she couldn't finish hers either.  I love a Vanilla Latte made at Starbucks, and am also a fan of the Vanilla brewed coffee, but I wouldn't purchase the VIA (at least the vanilla flavor) again, and I gave away the remaining 4 packs. I am still on the lookout for an excellent instant coffee, so if I try any more flavors, I'll update this review.<br /><br />Update:  Also sampled the Carmel flavor which unfortunately I also find overbearingly sweet.

review/summary: Burnt Caramel
review/text: First, I should state that I regularly buy other VIA instant coffees, Colombian and House Blend. Colombian is better, but I don't think they're too different. I even get the regular iced VIA every once in a while.<br /><br />Second, when I used to go to Starbucks (which was for over a decade until I switched to mom and pops and small chains), my drink of choice was the caramel macchiato ("iced grande upside-down" to be exact).<br /><br />So when I saw they made a caramel flavor VIA, I was excited to try it out. In short, it smells fantastic - but tastes nasty. I'm throwing the rest away it's that bad. It has a burnt taste to it, and while I think Starbucks frequently overroasts their beans (one of the big reasons I left), I believe the caramel flavoring is to blame. It tastes artificial, and that horrible taste stays with you. I guess I should have remembered the time, years ago, when I tried the Torani caramel syrup, which had a weird taste that was more butterscotch than caramel (avoid that, too).<br /><br />In short, there's just no substitute for the real (?) caramel sauce they use in the store. If the caramel macchiato is your drink, too, buy the squeeze bottle of the thick caramel drizzle along with a bottle of vanilla syrup and use that with the VIA Colombian and some milk. A little more work, but much better results.

I have tried all of the flavors and they are a nice way to start the day. I have been "into" coffee for almost twenty years and I have no problem with these. They wake me up just as well as brewed coffee. For those of us who need a cup of decent coffee to get us going in the morning, and aren't just drinking coffee as a fashion statement, these are great.

review/text: I got a free sample of the mocha flavor at Starbucks. The employee told me it was quite sweet and I probably wouldn't need any additional sweetener. When I tried this at home, I got quite a surprise and not in a good way. I love bold, rich coffee and this was NOT pleasant. It tasted watered down and weak. The "mocha" flavor was artificial and barely palatable. I added cream, thinking it might make things better but it only marginally helped. I added a tiny bit of simple syrup and that made it drinkable. All in all, I was disappointed and would not purchase this. I have had the original VIA (Columbia and Italian Roast) and they were far superior to the flavored stuff. If you already drink flavored coffee, maybe this will appeal to you. Otherwise, save your money! You can get instant coffee granules from Trader Joe's and their sipping chocolate for a better instant mocha coffee. Just make the hot chocolate (instructions on the tin of sipping chocolate) and add some instant coffee to taste. Ta-da!

I have had trouble finding the time to brew a real pot of coffee most mornings and it's even more of a challenge to keep a pot fresh until I get around to drinking it.  I have almost switched exclusively to Via packets for my morning caffiene and have found the sweetened, flavored packets to be a welcome treat.  The caramel flavor has quickly proven to be my favorite.<br /><br />The flavor and consistency is much higher quality than you would expect from instant product and it requires absolutely no special effort to prepare.  I keep a packet in my pocket and mix it with a cold bottle of water for iced coffee.  I think most people will be as surprised as I was to find the flavor remarkably similar to what you would get at your local Starbucks.  I have never had an issue with the getting the mix to disolve and I find that the drink keeps the same profile from start to finish.<br /><br />While it's not the cup of coffee that a barista would hand you, it's so close that you probably won't notice.

review/text: Starbucks VIA Vanilla is a great way to enjoy a morning coffee without having to run out to the local shop for a vanilla latte.  I don't drink plain brewed coffee, but have become a fan of latte and other types of flavored mix coffee drinks, mainly for the cream and sugar blending into the coffee.  The VIA packet is a good home substitute for what I get when I'm out.  Unlike the regular coffee VIAs, which my wife uses and splits between two cups, the flavored VIA packets can be used in their entirety.  In fact, if you use too much water or milk, it really dilutes the flavor down.  I've also tried the Cinnamon version and didn't care for that variety as much.  Flavor on those was very slight and not really the variation from a regular VIA that you'd want.

It's easy for me to make it in my office at a moment's notice, and I like the flavoring of the mocha--not too chocolately and sweet enough to skip the sugar. (I never have sugar around in the office, so this is nice). As another reviewer said, the mocha VIA also has great potential for mixed drinks. I'm planning to add it to a blender with ice, plain yogurt, and a tiny bit of honey to see how it works for a quick mocha smoothie.

review/summary: Disgusting artificial sweetener flavor
review/text: I have enjoyed Starbucks Via on several camping trips - what a life saver!  Recently someone gave me the Mocha flavored Via to try, apparently because they could not stand the taste after one sip.  Well I thought perhaps they were just too haughty, and I offered to take the rest.  I finally tried one last night, and now I know why it was given away by the previous taster.<br /><br />The Mocha flavored Via is disgusting.  Rather than having any flavor of chocolate at all, it has a strong artificial sweetener taste - as if someone dumped in a package of saccharine and called it cocoa.  It ruins what would otherwise be a usable cup of coffee.  Far superior is using the regular or Columbia flavored Via, and adding a few small squares of real Hersheys chocolate!

review/summary: I like the concept of an instant coffee....
review/text: I picked up a package of Via out of curiosity. For the record, I am the owner of a coffee roastery and a cafe which has won "Coffee Bar of the Year" for the past 4 years in CT. We roast coffee for other cafes as well so I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what a good coffee should taste like. Here's my impression of Via:<br /><br />It is certainly easy to prepare. I generally drink a 16oz coffee so I used 2 packets (they are sized for an 8oz serving) to prepare my cup. The coffee is ready to drink as soon as it is stirred.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black and what I taste is only the coffee (my preference for brewing water is a neutral pH of 7, a Langelier Index of zero and no chlorine, fluoride, or lime).<br /><br />On to the coffee:  A good Colombian should be very balanced, with good body, brightness* and a nutty flavor. Truth be told, most Colombian coffee on the market is a bit boring, and most are at best a simply decent, clean cup with almost no aftertaste. Unfortunately this is only true if it's fresh** from a roaster which is unlikely.<br />The Via Colombian that I tried might have started out as an Arabica coffee from the low end of the Specialty Coffee spectrum. Since I don't know the timeline for production, it is very difficult to say how old the coffee was to begin with but there is definitely a "woody" note that I associate with aged beans. The actual flavor might not be terrible if you where able to separate out this woody note but unfortunately Via has a very objectionable mouth feel and aftertaste. After a few seconds, there is a very noticeable residue left on your tongue that is bitter and astringent. I typically associate this with a brew that has had coffee grounds siting in it such as when a coffee filter collapses while brewing.<br /><br />Bottom line for me: I would drink it only if my only other choice was a widely available and well known "donut" shop coffee (which I am mystified why anyone would drink...just terrible). As for the flavored versions of Via, I am really not a fan of ANY flavored coffee since these flavorings are typically unhealthy and serve mostly to mask the objectionable tastes of the coffee. I drink coffee because I like the flavor. This was my second tasting of Via. I tried it when it was first released in 2009 and was hoping to see an improvement but my notes from that tasting are very similar. I really think that a high end instant is a good idea, but unfortunately for me, Via misses the mark.<br /><br />For a quick and relatively convenient cup, I would suggest investing $30 in an "AeroPress" made by Aerobie and widely available. Armed with a freshly roasted coffee from your local micro roaster, you get a tasty, easy to prepare cup, and a very simple cleanup..<br /><br />* We use the descriptive term "acidity" to describe brightness. This is not to be confused with the often heard term "acidic" which people lament about a coffee that upsets their stomachs. This is thought of by many people in the industry to be the result contamination of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, molds, fungus, and other contaminants often found in non-specialty grade coffee. We believe that most of these complaints would disappear simply by trying a better quality coffee.<br />** Fresh = less than two weeks from roasting. Most coffee is WAY beyond this timeline....

Let me start out by saying that this is the first Via product I have tried and I expected something a little more latte-ish than coffee-ish given the Mocha label.  Which is not what the labeling and ingredients imply, nonetheless that's what I had in mind.  I tried it this morning and it was good once I added milk.  I usually add milk to coffee, I just expected this to be milky already.  To me it tasted like slightly sweet, fairly bold coffe, I couldn't really detect a lot of mocha flavor.<br /><br />An hour later I was so buzzed out on caffeine I could hardly focus on my work.  I felt like I had just drunk a triple shot of espresso.  I was obnoxiously jittery, which is something I do not like.  Perhaps it was just me, or the brew I got, but whew!  I know from past experience that Starbucks is usually fairly high in the caffeine department but this was a little over the top, I only had one cup.<br /><br />So I took one star off since I couldn't taste a lot of Mocha and another for the jitters one cup gave me.

review/summary: Does not qualify as coffee, bleh!
review/text: I've had bad coffee and instant coffee before, this is terrible and I do not want to call it coffee.  I have only tried the Caramel flavor because I got it for next to nothing and I figured it was worth a try.  Some coffee is bitter and it is pleasant, this is bitter in a terrible way and the sweetening combined with this special bitter makes it repulsive.  I've tried it as a flavoring in brewed coffee, also disgusting.  You cannot escape the bad taste that lingers after each sip.  Nobody should drink this and form an opinion of coffee or Starbucks coffee based on this product.

review/summary: Not as good as unflavored Via
review/text: I love Starbucks Via Italian Roast, and when I'm out getting coffee I often order French Vanilla or Hazelnut. I thought I'd try the flavored Via to see what it was like, but I hesitated because it already has sugar in it and I don't like my coffee to be very sweet.<br /><br />As it turns out, the sweetness wasn't the problem - the flavor is just really off.  It tastes like those powdered instant coffee drinks that come in a tin. The vanilla flavor was a bit artificial, but I think it was really the instant-coffee taste that was off in this product. Somehow, the regular Via doesn't taste too much like instant coffee, but the flavored version does.<br /><br />I'm giving it three stars because it's convenient and it was worth a try, but I won't be buying it again. I'll stick to the unflavored Via.

review/text: I bought this directly from Starbucks thinking it would be somewhat close to the Mochas that I enjoy getting from there.  It is just OK.  I can say that it's convenient if you feel like having a mocha flavored coffee during the day or in the evening but I would still prefer the mocha's directly from Starbucks.

review/summary: Solidly a 2.5 drink
review/text: I found myself getting tempted by the little packages of instant Starbucks, so I figured that I would give the caramel flavor a try.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting the taste equivalent of a fresh cup of coffee with caramel syrup added, but I didn't really like that this was as bitter as it was. The caramel flavor is present but is so mild that I couldn't help but feel a little cheated. The overall flavor was still decent and better than some of the other instant coffees out there (the non-Starbucks instants, I mean), but I admit that I was disappointed. I did like that there was more than enough sugar to sweeten the drink, though. It was nice to not have to hunt for a packet of sweetener, although the caramel flavor didn't really soar through.<br /><br />I've liked the non-flavored instant coffees out there in the Starbucks line and was pretty impressed by those, so I think I might give the flavored varieties a skip for right now and just stick with the non-flavored and non-sweetened VIAs. I'm still going to give the cinnamon flavor a try so hopefully that'll be a little different.

review/text: Okay- I wasn't crazy impressed by the Mocha flavor on it's own, but I don't prefer coffee in general without cocoa.  However, add a pack of Swiss Miss Dark Chocolate Sensations instead of plain sugar...  JUST like ordering something decadent from Starbucks.  I normally do this with Gevalia Kenya, but this is even more tasty!  (If you don't want SWEET, you might not like this combo.) I feel like I've just come back from a Starbucks when I drink my morning Via mix- with a tiny bit of half & half?  Yum!!!  I find it so delicious I may need an intervention.

review/text: Ordered this product because I wanted a cup of instant with real coffee taste and it does make a full bodied cup of coffee, the rub comes over two issues.<br /><br />First is the cost, about a dollar a cup, sorry a little to rich for this retired person. Second each packet contains 60 calories worth of sugar. That means only one packet per day on my diet.<br /><br />Starbucks please make an unsweetened version and the price lets just say, I guess I'll have to find another brand.

review/summary: Convenient, okay taste, WAY over priced
review/text: I bought the Vanilla flavor to have a convenient cup of coffee for 1 person without having to brew a whole pot.  The taste is extremely artificial.  It's not a bad taste, but it is not a true coffee experience.  I wouldn't normally note that save for the fact that Starbucks markets their VIA as an identical taste to their brewed coffee.  I don't think I will be spending $7.00 for this product again.  My three stars are for the convenience.

review/text: I mix the mocha via with vanilla soy milk and ice and it makes a great Soy Iced Mocha. I have also mixed the vanilla via with chocolate almond milk over ice and it tastes good too (for those who have dairy sensitivities). It has a little bit of a bitter after taste, but I add 10 oz of milk per packet intead of 8 oz, and it makes it taste pretty good. If you want to reduce the sugar taste, use unsweetened soy milk or unsweetened almond milk.

review/text: Forget all that you know about instant coffee.  This stuff rocks!  I don't always have time to brew a cup of coffee, so when I don't, it's VIA to the rescue!  Of all the VIA flavors, mocha is my favorite.  It's very similar to a mocha beverage from Starbucks with the convenience of instant coffee.<br /><br />What makes it better is it's ALL NATURAL!  No chemicals, no artificial flavors, no high-fructose corn syrup.  A lot of mocha syrups (and many other flavors from brands) have artificial flavors, so it's refreshing to find one that does not.<br /><br />GO STARBUCKS!

review/summary: For those transitioning from soda
review/text: I have been a soda drinker in the past for my caffeine fix. I'm trying to acquire a taste for coffee because, although still containing caffeine, it is not quite as bad for me as all of the artifical sweeteners in the diet drinks I was buying for myself.<br /><br />I would normally swing by Starbucks and get a nonfat Caramel Macchiato. Since I am an ex-soda drinker, my tastebuds crave a lot of sweetness and I cannot handle normal coffee's strength. I decided to try the instant, since I am not a coffee connoisseur and it is a lot cheaper.<br /><br />This does not taste like the Caramel Macchiato that I had been getting at Starbucks - it is a lot stronger. I know it's not a one-to-one ratio because this is a Caramel Flavored coffee, not a macchiato, but my coffee naivete thought it would be close enough.<br /><br />What I try to do is make it with 12-16oz of water to temper the flavor down, and I fill about an inch and a half of my mug with some nonfat milk. It still does not taste as caramelly as the Caramel Macchiato, but it is healthier for me than the aspartame in soda. I should probably cut back on the sugars anyway.<br /><br />I'd rate it 5 stars if it really tasted like Caramel, but it's more of a subtle overtone.<br /><br />I see other reviewers saying it's too sweet, but if you're like me and you're trying to get off of soda, give this one a try. It's not as sweet as soda but still enough to satisfy your craving.

review/summary: Practically All Sugar - Yuck!
review/text: I'm the type of person who gets lured in by samples; samples always taste delicious to me (seriously, what's the psychological explanation for this?!). A barista offered a sample of the caramel-flavored coffee and I thought it tasted great. There was a $1-off-Via-plus-free-tall-beverage offer and I gave in. But it wasn't until I looked at the nutritional facts that I discovered there is an overwhelming amount of sugar. And sure enough, when I made my own cup of coffee, it was disgustingly sweet.<br /><br />I am never going to pay such an exorbitant price for packets of sugar. It doesn't make sense for my wallet or my body. For the same convenience and lower prices, I'd much rather buy Nescafe's Taster's Choice, which I find much more aromatic and rich with coffee flavor.
