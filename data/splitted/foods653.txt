review/summary: Bold French Roast flavor
review/text: I really like these French Roast k-cups.  I was concerned having read other reviews and ordered the Fog Lifter first (which I like as well but it is not as strong).  I ordered 80 k-cups which is a great value.  I have no issues with the "cupless" k-cup. I also do not find the flavor "burnt" or "bitter" which I read in other reviews.  I find it to be a full bodied bold coffee.  It works great in my Keurig and the coffee strength is perfect.  Flavor is robust and I look forward to having a cup.  I would recommend this coffee to others who enjoy the French Roast bold coffees.

review/text: I found that not only was keeping these pods fresh by keeping them in zip locks bags a pain, but that this roast was really too bold for me.<br />I can't get anyone at home or work to drink these.<br />I will stick with Green Mountain Nantucket blend in the future.

review/summary: Great coffee, reasonable price, compares well to other brands
review/text: I purchased "San Francisco Bay Coffee One Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, French Roast" about 2 ï¿½ weeks ago. Since then I've compared it to "Green Mountain Nantucket Blend", alternating between the two with an occasional "Tully's Italian Roast" mixed in.<br /><br />My wife prefers the slightly bolder blend of the Tully's; I prefer the Green Mountain. Both of us have found the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast" to be a good blend that's robust while not overwhelmingly bitter. It may well become our coffee of choice.<br /><br />Personally, I find the "Tully's Italian Roast" and "Newman's Own Special Blend" to have a bit of a biting after taste that I don't experience with the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast".<br /><br />I have friends who only use K-cups. I've given them samples of the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast". Their taste runs more to the bolder coffees. Both of them love the coffee.<br /><br />Several reviewers have commented about the sediment left in the bottom of the cup from the "San Francisco Bay, French Roast". I agree with them, there is sediment; it's just like I experience with the "Tully's Italian Roast" and "Newman's Own Special Blend". That seems to be typical of some of the bolder blends and especially the darker roasts. It may also be that the beans are ground finer on these blends to extract more flavor in the brew cycle.<br /><br />These are not traditional K-Cups but they'll work just as well in your Keurig coffee maker. I actually think I get better water flow through the coffee with this new design. My only complaint is the need to keep them sealed rather than in the carousel where I normally store my K-Cups. The cups are packaged in a very heavy plastic bag, which is properly vented for storing coffee. I cut the top enough to remove one cup at a time, then fold over the top and put a clip on it. We drink enough coffee that the 8-cup bag only lasts a couple of days. It's really not a big deal.<br /><br />Should you try it? Probably.<br /><br />I enjoy good coffee, even more when it's reasonably priced. I'm not a "coffee snob" and I'm willing to try new things. For me, the "San Francisco Bay Coffee" has been a good experience. I'll probably try some of the other blends as well. And, although I bought an 80-cup pack for this first try, I'm happy I have the choice of 36 or 12 count packs to try on the other blends.

review/summary: Great packaging idea, too bitter on the finish
review/text: The concept for packaging this coffee was great.  Simply putting the coffees in a ziploc bag preserved their freshness and the idea that I was putting less plastic in our local landfill was great as I live in a little village on the Yukon River.<br /><br />However, I found this roast to have a very bitter aftertaste.  I generally enjoy a full, dark roast and I like the bitterness of coffee.  That's the whole point.  But I was really unhappy with the finish in this particular French Roast and won't purchase it again.  I am slowly working my way through the 80 count I bought, on days when I have a taste for added creamer flavors.  This isn't a comment on any of the other San Fransisco Bay products, as I haven't tried them, just this particular roast.

review/summary: Great strong coffee, Waste-avoiding K-cups!
review/text: I love the fact that this delicious, strong K-cup ready coffee comes with an exposed filter.  I'd been trying to cut the bottoms off of the K-cups I had been using, in order to recycle them. (good intentions, but not realistic!) The fact that they don't even have the bottom portion of the "regular" K-cups while still maintaining excellent, rich flavor makes me a convert.<br /><br />This flavor, French Roast, is bold, strong and just what I'm looking for as a morning coffee, and holds up very well as iced coffee as well.<br /><br />I'll be buying many more of these!

review/summary: Give it a chance
review/text: After reading the reviews we jumped in with both feet and ordered this and the Fog Chaser. Here's my take on the French Roast after drinking all 36 cups:<br />* I prefer this to the Fog Chaser, but I like a darker roast.<br />* Don't be scared by the look, it's just a K-Cup without the plastic case. I love that this seems more eco-friendly.<br />* Okay, it's true, they smell a little funny. Not quite sure why they don't just smell like coffee, but who knows what other K-cups smell like without the plastic cover, right? Our solution was just not to smell them before brewing.<br />* The taste is bold, and my first cup tasted bitter and not so great. We don't use sugar or sweeteners so there was nothing to mask the taste! But, like most new things, after a couple of cups over a couple of mornings I found the taste was fine, especially for the price. I don't know if I would serve this to company though, I like really dark roasts but most people don't.<br />* I read a tip that said to prevent grounds in your cup, close the brewer lid slowly and gently. Works for us, we've had NO grounds in our cups.<br />So there we go, I'm ordering them again to take advantage of the Subscribe & Save option. I'm not going to say that this is the best coffee I've ever had, but for that 1st cup in the morning it's just fine.

review/summary: Great tasting, less waste
review/text: I did not buy these from Amazon, but apparently will in the future.  I was in my local membership-required-big-box store (am I allowed to say Costco?) when I saw this stuff for about 27 cents per serving.  Since it's very easy to return stuff there, I bought it.  As others have commented, it's unusual looking, in that just the familiar looking K-Cup ring and foil at the top are there.  The plastic cup around the bottom is missing.  But that doesn't matter and it actually creates less waste and probably costs less to manufacture.<br /><br />Off course, being green doesn't matter if the coffee tastes bad.  In this case, it does not.  It's got to be one of the two best French Roast K-Cups I have ever had.  Full of flavor, without being bitter or burnt.  I went back to the store a few days later and they had sold out and they are not sure of plans to get more, so it looks like I will continue to buy my coffee from Amazon, but instead of my usuall brand (Green Mountain French Roast), I will be buying these.

review/text: This has become our daily coffee. We were previously Starbucks (brewed at home) coffee drinkers, although I will say these are not quite as strong as Starbucks brewed coffee...not weak either though. I usually buy them at our local wholesale warehouse, where the price is a little better, but I come to Amazon when I am needing it fast and don't have time to go to the store. It makes a good cup of coffee, that I happily serve to guests. The only down side is that the individual packaging does not allow for display. Not a big deal.

review/text: I'm generally a fan of dark roast coffees, and this is one of the better K-Cups of that variety.  Perhaps not as strong as Emeril's but better than the Starbucks French Roast K-Cups.  (None of the K-Cups I've found are as tasty as a well-made Aeropress cup, but the ease-of-use, cleanup, and ability to change varieties for each person more than make up the difference.)<br /><br />The form factor doesn't seem to have any significant disadvantage for my.  This box contains 3 12-count sealed plastic bags (each with one of those one-way air valves).  I've kept the "open" dozen in a Gladware tub.  All's well.

I was worried about the weird shape at first but it still works in the brewer. I like that the packaging is trimmed down so I don't feel as guilty about the environental impact of overpackaging  (told you I live in SF!)  The French Roast is very bold and at first I was unsure...I think I like  it just fine but plan to try another roast next time. It also tastes a bit more acidic than other brands but that isn't such a bad thing either. I think I am getting used to it. My problem is that I switch from several different brands all the time so I may y always notice that difference. I recommend this and plan to order this many more times!  I would give it another half star if i could!

If you notice the bags are vacuum sealed and a zip lock bag would not work people. If it is not broken don,t fix it, and this is not broken so just keep these prices affordable, and keep the quality of the coffee just the way it is.

review/text: Yup not a K-Cup. If you don't like the non-plastic cup, then don't buy them.<br /><br />For our family, we like the taste, and the price. We've tried both this French Roast and the Fogchaser, and enjoy them both. We have not had any issues with grounds in the coffee. We keep them in a zip-lock bag after opening the 12 pack bag, so we have not had issues with them tasting stale (we drink them in about 2-weeks). I'm guessing that these cost less since they don't have to pay a royalty to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for using the K-Cup name and design.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fairly inexpensive alternative to the K-Cup, these are a great choice!

review/text: I bought these in an attempt to get some Kcups at a reasonable price that were NOT instant coffee. While I'm not picky about coffee, I'm not going to waste my  time with instant-coffee Kcups no matter how cheap they are. Using Subscribe&Save, these are half price compared to what I pay at Costco for my husband's favorite Kcup: Starbucks Cafe Vienna. They do not have the white plastic "cup," instead the part under the foil top is coffee-filter material in a curved-bottom shape. So only the foil top is pierced when the machine brews. I like to think this means less waste! They are packaged in thick sealed plastic bags in groups of 12. Aroma is extremely fresh, taste is great, just as strong/rich in my opinion as the Starbucks ones. Wish they came in more flavors and larger quantities!

It definitely needs improvement for filtration.<br />Due to too much remnants, I would not buy this again.

review/summary: Great Aroma
review/text: This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price.

review/summary: Everything we want!
review/text: Function: these cupless k-cups work perfectly in our Keurig B130 (the business version of the small personal brewer) which makes only a small cup.<br /><br />Less waste: We were really disappointed when we discovered that the plastic k-cups aren't recyclable. These are a terrific low-guilt, more responsible alternative.<br /><br />Less storage space: they take up much less room to store. I buy k-cups in quantity to save money, but then I had to dedicate a large cabinet to storing them! Not so with these, partially because they're less bulky and partially because...<br /><br />Great Price: these k-cups are much less expensive than other brands, especially at the Subscribe & Save price. At this price, I can buy less at a time and still pay less per cup than I could finagle with coupons & sales & bargain-shopping the major brands.<br /><br />Taste: Amazing!  I love a good dark French roast, and these are the best I've ever had.  Dark & rich but not bitter.  In fact, this morning I forgot to pour the creamer before I took a sip and I was amazed that it tasted really great.  I've tried to go without creamer before - I'd like to get used to coffee without it - but could never stand to...until I did it by mistake this morning and it was so smooth I drank the whole cup that way.  Trust me, this speaks volumes.<br /><br />Conclusion: I'm keeping my subscription, and I just increased the frequency of my deliveries because we found we drink these more than the regular k-cups. How can you beat cheap, tasty, less bulky, and less waste?

review/summary: Not a K-cup but works in a Keurig
review/text: As the other reviewers have said, this is not a K-cup! I uploaded an image of one of these pods next to a K-cup for comparison. The difference is the filter is exposed in these pods as opposed to being fully sealed in a K-cup. Since the coffee is exposed to the air when you open the package, you will have to seal them with a clip or put them in an airtight bag or tupperware to prevent the rest of the pods from loosing freshness. Having said that, in my experience they are a great inexpensive alternative to use in your Keurig brewer. The 36 count boxes arrived as unmarked brown cardboard boxes, not the colorful retail packaging shown on amazon. Inside each cardboard box, there are three clear heavy duty plastic bags, each of which holds 12 of the pods. The bags are not resealable!

review/summary: Very good coffee, packaging needs a bit of work
review/text: This coffee is very good, it has a nice aroma and a good strong flavor.<br /><br />I also like the "minimalist" k-cup design, but have a couple complaints with it.  Since the individual pods aren't sealed, you have to keep them in a sealed package to prevent spoilage.  It would have been nice if the plastic bag they came in was re-sealable.<br />Also, since the coffee doesn't just come out of a small hole in the bottom of the pod, the first cup you make with these will wash all the stray grounds out of your machine and into your cup.  Be forewarned that you should wash the pod holder before using these.<br /><br />Overall I like the product, just be careful about the different pod shape.

review/summary: A Truly Great Cup of Coffee
review/text: Unlike many others, I haven't paid much attention to the price of K-cups because I've been on Amazon's Subscribe & Save for K-cups for over a year now. Wanting to try another brew for a change prompted me to try these. I'd used this brand before in whole beans because they were at Costco so I knew I would like. Wow! These are very different from regular K-cups. Like another reviewer said, the aroma wafts like real brewed coffee and the flavor is rich and bold. I am so happy I took the chance on this. Subscribe and Save is the way to go!!!!!!!

review/summary: A new type of K-cup
review/text: I have been purchasing San Francisco Bay Whole Bean French Roast for years, for the money it has been a very consistent good cup of coffee. I bought a K-Cup brewer to please my guests. K-cup brewing really provides something for everyone without throwing pots of coffee down the sink.<br /><br />But I must admit that I didn't fall in love with all the K-Cup selections out in the market no matter what the price, brand or blend. They were generally hitting a 6 to 8 on a scale of 10. I tried the San Francisco French Roast last week and I really loved it. For me, it is the best out there in the K-cup world.

review/text: At first I wasn't sure but I figured, at the price i'd give it a try.<br />I was pleasantly surprised at the flavor and quality of this coffee.<br />The K-Cup design is somewhat different and you will need to store<br />the coffee in a zip lock bag after opening the bag containing the<br />coffee. Other than that, it's quality coffee at a very nice price.<br />We are talking $0.41 each rather than $0.50+ each.<br />You can't beat it!<br />I'm now buying the 80 count and enjoying it even more as<br />the price is now $0.35 each.<br />Try it...you'll like it!

review/text: I ordered this to see how it compared to the Fog Chaser. It is a good French Roast coffee and is comparable to the Tully's that came with my machine. French Roasts are good for K-cups because you stronger flavor out of one, however, for overall flavor this is not as good as the Fog Chaser.<br /><br />Price is excellent and the packaging is great as it has a much lower waste profile. It's also much easier to compost the grinds with these.

review/summary: not bad for "shelf stable".
review/text: So I'm a pretty big fan of GT Dave's Trilogy and Synergy lines of bottled kombucha, and, as anybody familiar with true, natural kombucha knows, it has to be kept refrigerated, or else so-called bad things could happen (like continued fermentation).  This brand does not need refrigeration, as it has gone through some sort of processing (pasteurization perhaps, yeast removal, I don't know really) to negate the need for storage and shipping complications.  Of course, the downside is that health benefits attributed to natural kombucha are somewhat lost here, since processing kinda tends to that, but it still contains bacteria cultures (at least according to the label), it's still "organic" and most importantly, it still retains that vinegary kick that sort of defines the kombucha taste.  Make no mistake, this product is far sweeter than GT Dave's, 60 calories for an 8.4 ounce can (vs. 60 calories for a 16 oz bottle of GT's ), but it's still got some kombucha-y flavor.  It's perhaps not as "yeasty", and is certainly missing any hint of alcohol from the original fermentation - I'd need a bottle of GT's to compare to be sure - but it goes down nice and easy anyway.  It would be a good way to get into drinking kombucha for someone that isn't used to it yet.<br /><br />So, it's not a replacement for GT's or any other naturally fermented and bottled kombucha product (several come to mind that have pulled from shelves), but it *is* tasty, organic, shelf stable, and convenient, and I like it for that reason.<br /><br />As for the flavor, I've tried two (of many) from this brand now, the "traditional" and the "green tea and lemon".  So far my preference leans to the "green tea and lemon" just because I like the tartness of the lemon.  The "traditional" hints at stereotypical sweet tea, with that kombucha-y vinegar kick, but it's just a little sweet for me.  Of course, it's better to find a sample around town before committing to a case, if possible, at a health-food store, or more progressive grocery chain.  I'll probably order another case of the green tea and lemon when I finish off the first one.

review/text: This is way too sweet and artificially fizzy.  Somehow the pasturization process took out the goodness of the real Kombuchas. I've found that GT's Synergy is one of the best.  It also contains raw Chia, an outstanding energy food. Watch out for others, like this Wonder Drink, that try to use the same words and imitate the quality companies that produce Kombucha the way it is meant to be drank. Find one of the GT's Kombucha products and compare for yourself.

Yes.<br /><br />If you are looking for a funky tasting beverage where the taste horrifies yet refreshes and leaves you wanting more then give this a try.  The citrus/vinegar combo is weird at first but now I'm hooked.  As I am on a diet I like that the cans are small so I can get my taste fix yet not go crazy on the calories.

review/summary: Good, but not really kombucha
review/text: This drink is tasty and made with some pretty simple and natural ingredients. However, carbonation is added (in true kombucha it is a natural part of fermentation) and the drink is obviously pasteurized, which destroys any live culture (and thusly the probiotics that make kombucha popular as a health drink).

review/text: When I first tried this, I shrugged my shoulders and went "eh".  Wasn't sure about it.  Then I started sipping more, then a little more until I really understood the Kombucha thing!  I'm not a Kombucha connoisseur by any means but I do enjoy drinking it.  I don't have any idea about the whole pasteurized, non pasteurized concept, but what I do know is that this particular Kombucha makes me feel great.  Can't explain it, but I guess you can say it "wakes me up" or makes me feel more "alert" or something.  Whatever it is, I enjoy it and I enjoy the way it tastes!  It's definitely an acquired taste but my husband and two daughters love it, and that's saying something!!<br /><br />We have it on subscribe and save.  Love the fact that we can satisfy our need for something bubbly while receiving the added health benefits from the green tea and enzymes!  Good stuff!

review/text: Do Not Buy!<br />I bought this case of 12 bottles 2 months ago and have consumed a few of them. At first I noticed that the bottle looked different than the ones I've seen before. The bottles are opaque instead of the clear plastic I have seen in the past and is pictured. Secondly I thought the taste wasn't as strong as I had remembered but I didn't have any other mustard to compare it to. The more I used it the more convinced I became that it was not truly Grey Poupon since it just tasted like cheap dijon mustard to me. At Christmas I received a jar of real Grey Poupon and compared the two, no question they are not the same. I cannot return this item and I have used a few bottles. I would not buy again and I would not recommend it to anyone.<br />One note, I purchased this product through Amazon but Sold by: J&M Goods, LLC<br />Not sure if that makes any difference now you can buy direct.

Most have an ingredients list along the lines of "Pumpkin seeds, salt, (maybe some kind of oil)" and that's it, and usually taste as bland as paper to me. I like salt, nay...I love salt. These have a nice roasted flavor, and salt you can actually taste. They are not overly salty tasting, you don't feel the salt on your fingers, and there isn't a layer of salt in the bottom of the bag like you see in a bag of pretzels. It was nice not to have to get out the salt shaker and dump some in the bag.<br /><br />I wound  up eating nearly a whole bag in one sitting. If you like nuts and seeds, and enjoy a tasty salty snack then you will most definetly like these.

review/summary: Sumatra's the best and extra bold
review/text: Okay, the doctor said, after the second heart attack that some changes could help. Caffeine was one area. But I did not want to give up my coffee, and it was always Starbucks (home brew), no store in our small town. I've been hooked on the strength and goodness of Sumatra for years. No restaurant in our area makes coffee as good as my wife makes my home brew Sumatra. So I give Decaf Sumatra from Starbucks a try.<br /><br />HONEST, NO LIE, I COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE. I even tried mixing half regular with half decaf. It always comes out tasting great and tasting like Starbucks Sumatra. There was a couple of days of headache that goes with caffeine withdraw, the reason for the 1/2 and 1/2 mix. But now, Decaf is as good as Regular. We keep the regular available for company, and I imbibe when that is made, but I never really know unless I see the bag and read the label. Honest!<br /><br />True, Starbucks costs a bit more. But you get what you pay for.<br />Stock up when you see a sale. I've had Starbucks in the freezer (we always use the whole bean and grind weekly) for over a year and it tasted fine. I've even bought outdated Starbucks, and it tasted better than the popular shelf brands, even past its sell-by date.<br /><br />No I don't work for Starbucks. They don't pay me for this ad. But they do make plenty of profit from my personal demand that I buy only Starbucks Sumatra--be it Regular or Decaf.

review/summary: Outrageous pricing
review/text: The La Lechera item immediately preceding this on the page was priced at 4/$12.53. The Dulce de Leche, which is usually a few cents more expensive than the condensed milk was priced at $14.95.  I thought that was also for four, but when the order arrived there was ONLY ONE.  $15 for a $3.30 item (Walmart price) is outrageous.<br /><br />Returning it would cost over $6, so I guess my wife will enjoy a few gold plated sundaes and I will have to learn to read descriptions more carefully.  I feel that many Amazon Prime items are overpriced to recoup the cost of free shipping.<br /><br />The product is delicious, but a dollar an ounce is way out of line for a product that usually sells for under 25 cents per ounce.<br /><br />P.T. Barnum was, unfortunately, right.

review/summary: No hydrogenated oils, but too sweet
review/text: I love that this is a no-stir option without hydrogenated oils. I really hate stirring natural peanut butter. Plus, oily peanut butter - yuck! My only issue is that it's far too sweet. I got used to peanut butter without sugar. I also think the company is being a little deceptive. They say that there's "no added sugar," but then admit in the description that there's cane juice. The carb count, for anyone who's interested, is 8 grams (3 grams of which are sugar) per 2 tablespoons. Whether it's cane juice or sugar or corn syrup, it's really all sugar. Because of the over-sweetening and higher carb count, I probably won't be ordering from this company again, but if they ever make a no-stir peanut butter without any kind of sugar, I'll be the first in line.<br /><br />Fortunately, I was able to turn the peanut butter into low-carb peanut butter cookies. The sweetness doesn't bother me as much in cookie form.

review/summary: Good Natural brand
review/text: I like all the flavors in the Peanut Butter Co. line. The Maple one is fantastic -- not one I thought I would like and it turned out to be my favorite. The smooth operator tastes like most other natural pb's - nothing out of the ordinary. The price is higher than some other brands. It's worth a try and definitely better than the non-natural brands, but don't expect too much difference from other natural brands. (There is some added oil and salt.)

review/text: This has become my absolute favorite peanut butter.  Buying by the 6 pack and also with my Amazon Prime membership, it's a great bargain.  I just wish they made this in bigger jars.  My family eats a lot of peanut butter so 6 jars do not last us very long.  I like that this is all natural, and you don't have to stir it.  It's not that sweet tasting, so if you like a sweet peanut butter this might not be for you.  I think it has a really good taste and texture.  Their other flavor the PB and Dark Chocolate is amazing as well!

review/text: I love that this is a no-stir natural peanut butter. It has no trans fats and no cholesterol, no hydrogenated oil and no high fructose corn syrup. What I didn't expect was the extra sweetness provided by the evaporated cane juice and palm fruit oil. I prefer pure, ground peanuts. Nevertheless, I would purchase this again. I think children would probably prefer it over natural, oily p.b. too.

review/text: I don't know about you, but when I go looking for a product that explicitly states it has no added sugar, I mean sugar in the general, anything-that-is-chemically-sugar sense.  These folks make the "no added sugar" claim, and then follow it up with (oh by the way) "a little bit of cane juice for sweetness."  Which is to say, added sugar.  3 grams per serving, in fact, if my online search for this product's nutritional information is correct.<br /><br />Who are these people, unemployed politicians?<br /><br />I'm sticking with the Fifty50 brand.  Not only are they not lying through their teeth about not adding sugar, but they also donate half their profits to Diabetes research.

review/summary: Delicious, if a bit fragile
review/text: My wife and I used to eat these all the time back when I lived in Central Illinois. Strangely, when I moved to Chicagoland, we couldn't find them any more. So, I was thrilled to discover I could get them from Amazon.<br /><br />These are incredibly tasty. And, unlike many other brands, they are free of trans fats. My only criticism is that they're a bit more fragile than some other brands, especially after heating them in the over per the package directions. You have to be careful biting into them to prevent your entire taco from falling apart. If they were a bit more robust, I'd give them 5 stars.<br /><br />One thing to note: being preservative-free, they have a relatively short shelf life. The case I got from Amazon had a "best by" date about 3 months in the future. So, before ordering 12 boxes, make sure that you can go through at least a box per week.

review/text: When you live in Kalamazoo it can be difficult to get taco shells without preservatives.Sounds weird I know. Even so I was delighted to see Little Bear Shells on Amazon. Unfortunately, there was a severe communication issue. My shells arrived -- 1 box of 12 shells. I called customer service and tried to explain that more than $20 for one box of taco shells was crazy and that clearly there were supposed to be 12 boxes of 12 shells each or 144 shells in my order. The rep did not understand. She was confused by my complaint, after all the site said 12 and I had received 12. We agreed to disagree. To her credit, she was very kind about refunding the money. I may order these shells again (they are yummy tasting) but I'll wait until they change the number in the package or the number of packages in the order.

review/summary: My water alternative!
review/text: I must say I am not someone who usually writes reviews, but I am making an exception because I finally discovered the perfect healthy drink product on the market and trust me when I hear about a new beverage I am quick to try it, kinda like the inner researcher in me ;) .<br /><br />I am an avid food and beverage label reader and Amara's ingredients are legit. The drink isn't 'fake healthy' like a lot of other 'healthy' beverage companies. It is the perfect mixture of health in a can and it's low calorie (low cal's are important to me, since I don't like to drink my calories). I love how Amara is like "water +". I am someone who tries to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day and water can get boring, but I have found Amara to be my go-to as my water with a kick. I like that it is low in sugar, has a light zing of carbonation, and that I can drink multiple 16oz cans (can't do that with any liquid besides water) and it's never overwhelming nor boring. It truly is my water alternative and it is sure addicting.<br /><br />I will admit I was nervous to try Amara for a few reasons, one because it looked like an energy drink (I really dislike those). Two, because I am sensitive to caffeine, but I've never felt glittery or weird from the amount of caffeine in Amara (maybe because of the electrolytes it has and so I never feel dehydrated or off from it), and three because I am a runner and thought the carbonation would hurt my stomach, but surprisingly it never did and made me feel great during and after a workout! I even like to drink Amara in the morning on my way to work!

Not only the green color of the drink is obviously artificial; when louched, the potent green is still present, making the final product greenish instead of the white it should be.  You can only taste a strong anise flavor, and a burning sensation when you are finished.  No hint of wormwood at all!<br /><br />I would not recommend this absinthe even to beginners.  Don't waste your money on this one.<br /><br />P.S. I refuse to discuss thujone content and other non-sense and myths in my reviews.  If you are interested in thujone, go eat sage and forget absinthe altogether.

review/text: Initially ordered this at slightly over a dollar per can. These are big cans (22 oz) instead of the smaller ones, so that was a good deal. The dogs loved this (Chicken flavor) and the T-bone Steak flavor as well, so if they're happy and jumping around to gobble it down, that's good enough for me. I mix it in with dry crunchy food and they lick their bowls clean. I haven't tried it myself (just can't get hungry enough to eat dog food...)  but it smells good. I see the price has roughly doubled since the first order however, so I'm going to have to look elsewhere for a better price or find something else. No problem with the item itself, just the price, and even then, only because it was a good deal before.

The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

review/summary: Feed my two dogs only Wellness brand. Consistently on top ten canned dog food lists
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: This is the ONLY food my dog will eat
review/text: I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Wellness is excellent!
review/text: My pups LOVE this food!  WELLNESS products have consistently proven to be top of the line food for dogs and cats and their Chicken Stew is no exception!<br />This is so well made and although the sauce is kinda slimy, it is a healthy slimy and one that nourishes my dearest of creatures!  Please note that this food is not meant as a dish all unto itself, but rather, it is a food topper to go with dry food nuggets.  Together the nutrition abounds!

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/summary: Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans
review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/text: The ratings for this food are among the highest and my Labrador LOVES this stuff!  I feel very good giving him this high quality food and am glad that my picky eater wants something that is so good for him.  It's chunky and you can see peas, carrots, potato, and, of course, the chunks of meat.  I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!
review/text: I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.

review/summary: Tasty topper my dog loves!!!!!
review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: Wellnes Dog Food
review/text: It is a good dog food.  Our dogs stools have become normal since using it.  My only complaint is when you open the can there is a gell similar to when you open a can of Spam, which has to be scraped off and you lose some dog food because of the space taken by the gel.
