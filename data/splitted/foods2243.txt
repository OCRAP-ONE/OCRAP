review/summary: Amazon sent the wrong item for the second time
review/text: Three times I have attempted to purchase Kraft Viva Italian Dressing from Amazon.com and I have only been successful once.  Twice Amazon has substituted Kraft Red Wine Vinaigrette Dressing for my desired purchase.  While this dressing is decent, it is a flavor of dressing I could easily purchase at my local grocery store.  The Viva Italian that I desire is not.  That is why I order it through Amazon, which seems to be the only place it is available.  However, twice Amazon has substituted Red Wine Vinaigrette.  This incompetence makes me extremely reluctant to use Amazon.com for future purchases.

review/summary: Best bottled salad dressing, ever!
review/text: To the point, there is no better "store-bought" vinaigrette. In fact, the only other bottled dressing products we buy are blue cheese and caeser. The bad news? You can rarely find it in grocery stores any more. I'd been having my daughter mail it to me from Alabama until I discovered it here at Amazon. Thank you, Amazon!<br /><br />This dressing is delicious on fancy mixed greens or, the way we often have it in the summer, just plain crunchy iceberg with a sprinkle of Seven Seas.

review/summary: Best Bottled Dressing
review/text: Excellent dressing!!!  It is also very hard to find.  I live in the Pittsburgh area and cannot find anyone that sells it.  They have the light version, which does not taste nearly as good as this one.  To make this light you can just pour off some of the oil while it is still separated before shaking it, and retain the flavor.  I hope Amazon continues to carry this because it is the only thing other than homemade we will use.  This is low in sugars so it does not taste sweet at all.  It is a true vinaigrette.  It is tasty on all kinds of lettuce and also on cut up tomatoes or cucumbers by.

review/text: I am a chive addict.<br /><br />I use them in cottage cheese, on cream cheese, potatoes, rice, meat and more.<br /><br />As a volume user, the high cost of buying in the small jars in grocery stores is not an option.<br /><br />Not only do I save a lot of money buying in large containers, but as a bonus I get a better quality product than any other dried chives that I have tried.<br /><br />When you look at the contents, you will immediately notice that they are a more vibrant green than other bottled chives.  And in this case, looks are not deceiving.  These chives have a noticeably fresher taste than I have found in other brands.<br /><br />The only way to get better chives would be to grow them fresh in your own garden.

So, the last time I ordered Tone's dried mushrooms (which are also excellent, BTW), I was going to order some of these too.  However, I discovered that they're $8 here on Amazon, whereas they're only $4 for the same size container in Sam's Club.  Just a heads-up.

They're a vibrant green (hint: store them away from the light to maintain color and fresh taste), very flavorful and natural-tasting. I use them in scrambled eggs, potato dishes and all the usual places one would sprinkle some tasty chives. I keep a small amount in a refillable airtight container for daily use, and store the large container in a dark cupboard. Get these, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: OK Coffee
review/text: I purchased the coffee maker based on being able to get Starbucks. I purchased boxes of Starbucks, Columbian and Breakfast Blend, but am now running low. I decided I would try some others. I hated Grevalia, the Maxwell House is OK coffee, but like drinking flavored water, when I saw the French Roast, which is supposed to be DARK and assumed stronger and fairly inexpensive, I thought I should at least try it. It is hard to replace Starbucks, but the French Roast is OK, not wonderful. I tried the Narob and several different others, but FOR ME this is going to have to be my Starbucks replacement.<br />I had heard that Tassimo was supposed to get a better choice by mid to end of summer and it appears they have fallen short. I had heard that Starbucks was to partner with Cruinart, but so far it's not showing up. I'm not sure these single cup guys are so great, when you are forced to a limited brand of coffees. We are back to Corporate America manipulating our morning cup of wake up.

review/summary: Oh's what a cereal! (^_^) ...Oh's what a price (O_o)
review/text: Man I love Oh's cereal. It is really great to the last bite, but the size of the box its so small compared to all the other cereals out there. The price is crazy for such a small box...but oh's is one of the best cereals I have ever ever eaten. It keeps me coming back despite the small box, and crazy price. If you never had it you should try it just once. It is wonderful I give it 3 stars only because of the price and how much food you get. If the portions were more fair even for this price it would be five star gold...

review/text: This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!<br />Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores.

review/text: Oh yes. This cereal is delicious. It's O-shaped corn pieces with "good things in the middle", like real oatmeal. This is a Quaker product, after all. The caramel-like taste, which I'd compare to Cap'n Crunch or old school Mr T, Gremlins and Batman cereal, is sweetened with honey, graham (cracker) flour and brown sugar.<br /><br />It's not a good-tasting but a great-tasting cereal, easily one of the best I've ever tried. But; get this; it's too crunchy. No, it wont get soggy in milk, at-least not in any reasonable amount of time, but that's the problem because it makes for a hard chew. If it had the texture and consistency of, say, Cheerios, it'd be perfect.<br /><br />marcellee.com

review/text: I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that "the site who has everything including a church" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small.

review/text: I tried these on a whim several weeks ago to offset the amount of chocolate I had eaten that week. It was nice and sweet for a few weeks with that first box. But then I tried it again this week and the aftertaste was so strong. The overall texture and layout of each piece is like Fruit Loops but with tons of honey add and less fruit or frosting. One box should be more than enough.

review/summary: Things you must understand about OH's
review/text: The 5 stars is based on 1)the taste which is amazing and 2) the price which is $1.99.<br /><br />HOWEVER  there is much to dislike in OH's.  They are NOT healthy, in fact they are the only cereal I've seen made with hydrogenated vegetable oil which is basically margarine.  The lard will coat your spoon and roof of your mouth and probably arteries with a white oily film that does not rinse off with water alone.  It must be diluted in soap and scrubbed.<br /><br />It is captain crunch shaped in a ring with bits in the middle and somehow sweeter and rougher on your mouth.  Oh's virgins WILL have bloody pallates if not careful.

review/summary: Mold?
review/text: I just looked at an unopened bottle on my shelf and saw crap floating around in it which looked like mold.  You know, the stuff that looks a little dark and a lot slimy.  Gross.  There were also crystals floating around.  The expiration date was in 2014 and we ordered it about three months ago (June 2012).  No more liquid for us.  We just threw this one away and canceled our subscribe and save order.<br /><br />Makes me wonder if this is why my wife has been ill for the last few weeks.  Threw what was left of that bottle away, too.<br /><br />By the way, my lot number was 1203123, best by 03/14.

review/text: I was disappointed with this product.  It is very watered down.  One serving is 5 drops, and a big mug for me is like 15 drops.  Even 5 drops seemed like less than a serving to me.  I have used a previous brand that was not like water, but like glue, and it only took 1 drop per serving.  For the premium price, I was not impressed.

Now I enjoy iced tea sweetened with stevia knowing that I am not adding any calories or artificial sweeteners to my diet. And there are actually health benefits to using stevia! Once you start using it you won't ever want any other kind of sweetener! Oh, and the price was REALLY great... much less than in our local stores.

review/summary: First time user :)
review/text: I decided to try the liquid form of sweet leaf instead of the powder this time. I love my ice coffee and iced tea, and with the powder it would clump. It was still ok, but I felt like I was using more just to get the sweetness (powder it totally good with hot tea or coffee)...This is my second day using the liquid form, and I LOVE IT!! I'm hoping it lasts longer compared to the 3 pack box of sweet leaf packets which would last me exactly 2 weeks and that would cost me $20. So I'm hoping by spending $10 more for the liquid, that this lasts longer :)<br />Also I read about people complaining of the taste or aftertaste...you get that with anything you try differently..I know when I used splenda and i switched to sweat leaf I wasn't thrilled with the taste. Not that it was horrible it was just different from what I was used to. After a little while I was used to the taste. I know now after using sweat leaf for over 6 months if I run out and use splenda or even regular sugar, they taste bad to me now. I totally recommend this product it's a much healthier alternative to no-calorie subs. Thanks for reading. Have a great day :)

review/summary: Love this product
review/text: In an effort to greatly reduce our sugar intake we tried a number of non-sugar sweetners. Then started taking note of the glycemic index since some alternative sweetners are as high as sugar and therefore evoke basically the same response in your body. Started using stevia products and discovered that many are only a little bit stevia and a lot of other unacceptable ingredients. Sweet Leaf is great on all levels, including the biggie: taste! Best of all, the drops. At first the price seems prohibitive because it is a little bottle, but we were going through the packets (which are nice when you travel) way to fast, and realized how many more servings were in that little bottle. My husband likes to use stevia in ice tea and the packets were a little tricky to mix in cold drinks. Voila! The drops are perfect for mixing in any drink. We love this product! Oh and one more plus, the gassy reaction some people have to xylitol and other sugar alcohols? Not a problem with stevia. Specifically Sweet Leaf.

review/summary: Great product, and great price!
review/text: I use Stevia every day, and my last bottle was running low. So I ordered the 4-ounce 2 pack of the SweetLeaf SteviaClear. I guess I was thinking that the bottles I usually buy at the health food store were 4 oz. Boy, was I wrong! Imagine my surprise when I opened my package yesterday to find 2 much larger bottles than I thought I was going to be getting! These are the large 4 oz. bottles that I USED to be able to find locally, but the store that sold them closed down, and now I can only get the 2 oz. Getting a 2-pack of 4 oz. bottles at this price is unheard of (at least for me), because I used to pay $18-$20 for just ONE bottle! I love this product, and am pleasantly surprised that I was able to get it at such a great price! I'll stop looking for them locally now, and just get them from Amazon from now on..... thanks Amazon for the wonderful value, and for delivering it right to my door, thus saving me from going on a 'wild goose chase' to find them, and also to find them at a reasonable price!<br /><br />Additionally, I've tried many different types and brands of Stevia, and out of all of them, I find SweetLeaf to be the best. With Stevia, a little goes a long way.... otherwise, you can end up with a bitter taste. This doesn't happen as often, and not as strongly, with SweetLeaf (you'd have to practically pour it into your drink, rather than using it by drops, in order to end up with a bitter taste from this brand). But I still recommend that you use it sparingly. You can always add another drop if it's not sweet enough. I also buy SweetLeaf stevia in the small squeeze bottles to take along on travel; I always have one in my purse.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00604VM6Q">SweetLeaf SteviaClear Liquid Stevia, Travel-Size - 6 ml, 5 pack</a><br /><br />That way, if I stop for coffee while I'm out, I have my stevia, and don't have to resort to using real sugar, or even worse, chemical (artificial) sweeteners....

review/summary: Great Product that has Helped Me Make Healthy Changes to My Diet
review/text: I'm a big fan of SweetLeaf Stevia. A year ago, a few of the flavored varieties (Lemon, Root Beer, Chocolate) helped me make the transition from Diet Soda to water. This was a huge deal for me as I've disliked water my entire life. I love it now, and no longer use the flavored Stevias in it. Now the SteviaClear is helping me to add Green Tea to my diet by sweetening it enough to make it palatable to me. (I use about 6 drops in a 16-ounce cup.) I hope that, as with the flavored Stevias I used in water, I'll be able to reduce and then from eliminate the SteviaClear from my tea over the next few months.<br /><br />This is a great product that I really feel has helped me to make healthy changes in my diet.<br /><br />I've seen the SteviaClear for sale locally for $24 for ONE 4-ounce bottle which makes the Amazon price incredibly attractive, particularly with the Subscribe & Save option.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Coffee lover is VERY disappointed!!!  YUCK!!!
review/text: I purchased this specifically for using in my coffee, which I happen to like with a lot of cream & a lot of sugar (figuratively.)  I've been using Splenda for several years with great results and decided to give Stevia liquid a try considering there's just not enough information about whether sucralose (Splenda) is potentially harmful for you or not.  All I can say is YUCK!  Disgusting!!!  If you only use a little, you can hardly tell you've used any.  And if you use more it NEVER gets sweet, but instead turns bitter.  I'd rather drink non-sweetened coffee.  I'm not sure how this stuff works with cooking and other uses, but since I only purchased it specifically to use in my coffee...what a waste of my money!  YUCK YUCK YUCK.

review/text: Okay I only left 1 star for this item not due to it actually being bad but due to the fact that I was only able to use it once. I tried this for the first time yesterday morning in my coffee. I added 5 drops (recommended serving was 5-8 drops). I had an allergic reaction within a couple of minutes of taking literally a few sips of my coffee. The sips were small enough that you couldn't even tell I had any. It started that my hands got beyond itchy and felt like they were on fire and red. Then it went to my feet and my heart began racing and pounding so hard I could hear it in my ears as if I had just been running at full speed. Very scary feeling. I also broke out in hives and was very itchy for a few hours. Needless to say I am now stuck with a ton of this that I can not use plus the money.

review/text: I love this Stevia brand. Always good, never any fillers - especially not vegetable oil!  Yuck!  My only complaint is the price. Amazon still has the best deal around but, geez!  Since Stevia has become popular the price has skyrocketed. Using Amazon's auto ship saves the most money, but I still think it's too high. Once you sign on for the auto ship, I don't think they should raise the price as a reward for customer loyalty. But then, Corporate America doesn't seem too concerned with the "Little Guy" anymore.

The dropper makes it very easy to use and with just a couple drops I have a delicious cup of healthy tea without any excess calories.<br /><br />I also use stevia for cooking but for measuring purposes I prefer to use stevia powder -<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006QRU5ZQ">100 Grams (3.5 Oz) Stevia 95% Steviosides Bulk Powder</a>.  The powder is actually a bit sweeter than the liquid so just remember the golden rule when measuring, a little goes a very long way.  One teaspoon is equal to about a cup of sugar!

review/text: This was my first time buying a stevia product and I'm very pleased. I've been using it for over a month for our lunch time beverage like lemonade, jamaica tea, cucumber lemonade and ice tea. Nor my husband or my children have noticed the change from splenda to stevia. I have also used it in my morning oatmeal, coffee, and just today I baked some cornmeal blueberry muffins using stevia instead of sugar asked in the recipe and they came out great! Artificial sweeteners all contain chemicals as opposed to stevia which is all natural so I fully recommend this product for anyone on a long term sugar free diet.

review/text: I have 4 bottles - use it mostly for coffee.  It is less bitter than artificial sweeteners but certainly bitter compared to sugar.  The 1st bottle lasted a month but the 2nd lasted about 3 weeks.  The bitterness causes some variance in "dose" whereas I always used the same amount of sugar because I'm balancing sweetness vs bitterness. My 3rd bottle has several "floaters" in it that I believe/hope are harmless - big enough that any filter should have caught them so I wonder about quality...  On balance, I like it - I have stopped using granulated sugar in my coffee and have started to lose a few pounds which I'm fairly certain is because of SweetLeaf.<br /><br />Update: I contacted SweetLeaf directly through their website and they replaced the questionable bottle - they responded very quickly(rare in my experience)

review/summary: Simply the Best Stevia Product!!!
review/text: I've used this product for quite a few years, after trying MANY other brands and forms, and still find this to be the absolute best stevia product--hands down!  I don't know what we would do without this product.  We use it every day, all day, for coffee, tea, sweetening yogurt fruit, etc.  All our family members like it, too.  One bottle lasts for over two months, usually three.  It has no aftertaste, a few drops is all it takes and finally, we've been able to almost eliminate sugars from our diet without "suffering".  There are 2,880 drops in a 4 oz or 120ml bottle, according to the manufacturer.  We love it!<br />UPDATE:  Received new shipment and bottle label has changed.  Now states there are approx. 600 servings per bottle at 5-8 drops per serving or to taste.  Last few bottles seemed slightly weaker, but still the best of all the other brands, by far.  We still love it!

review/summary: Everything but coffee.
review/text: It's great in everything but coffee, & now I know why. If you use it in relatively bland food, you need to use VERY little, so all you get is the sweetness. If you use it in something with a stronger flavor (like coffee), it takes more of the product to overcome any bitterness & you start getting into the area where the stevia starts contributing a bitterness of its own.  So I use Ideal in coffee only. But this liquid fine in everything else I've tried it in, and it lasts FOREVER. So I think I'll probably keep getting both. I still give it 5 stars.

review/text: I've tried stevia from other manufacturers, but always come back to SweetLeaf.  There is just no comparison.  It's easy to use in all recipes that call for sugar or other sweeteners.  It's also better for you than sugar and Splenda.  No after taste. I use the liquid Stevia in beverages.  It only takes a drop or two, depending on your taste. So if your looking for a calorie free sweetener you simply must try SweetLeaf Stevia first.  Don't waste your money on anything else.  It's the BEST.

review/text: Tip I learned - you don't have to keep it in the fridge! Even though it's recommended, it's not necessary.  2 drops equal one teaspoon of sugar.  I keep my bottle at work in a desk drawer and sweeten everything from tea to coffee.  I love the sweet taste of sugar, so I put in 8 drops per cup - and the drink is never sour, it's as sweet as real sugar, if not better.  At home I make lemonades.  About 20 drops per one large water bottle [24oz], a nice squeeze of lemon juice, and a few drops of lime juice.  If you don't have real lemons and limes, just use concentrated juice.

review/summary: Not Even Close to Sugar Taste
review/text: We moved our family from sugar about three years ago and had settled on Splenda as our sugar substitue.  We use it to sweeten Lipton iced tea which we make in one-gallon containers.  We'd love to move to a sweetner that is all natural and thought this might work.  Yuck! is all I can say for the taste.  We've used about half of one of the bottles and Yuck is the feedback from our entire family and extended family.  The taste starts off kind of sweet but has a really weird aftertaste that just ruins it all.  I haven't tried it in anything else but this will simply not work for us.  We have tried Truvia and it is almost a perfect substitute taste wise, but is still a bit expensive and does contain the sugar alcohol.

review/summary: No, it's not the same "sweet" as sugar but may be a good natural alternative to artificial sweeteners.
review/text: The flavor of this stevia blend reminds me of artificial sweeteners.  The more you use per serving, the more distinct the "not sugar" taste is pronounced.  Of course, it has its benefits as it is a natural sweetener rather than a chemistry experiment.  Given the choice of an artificial chemical sweetener or this product, I'd go with this product even though it's a little expensive.  Those with diabetes or who are GI conscious may also want to explore using agave nectar.  Where stevia has no calories, agave has a caloric load similar to that of honey (though it has a very low GI). Agave's flavor is fairly neutral (in the light varieties) so its "sweet" flavor is less at odds with the flavor of sugar.<br /><br />I think this product is "ok" - but I can't say that I like it well enough to give it 4 stars.  There's no way I'd use it as a sugar substitute for cooking.  It's fine in beverages, but if you have a penchant for over sweetening your drinks (southern sweet tea is traditionally very sweet, for example) you're likely going to notice the "it's not sugar" taste.  If you use artificial sweetners already, I'd say give this a try.  But don't switch from sugar to stevia and expect to be delighted.

review/text: I started using this product at the recommendation of the HCG Diet. The liquid form is better than the packets on the market because those use a chemical to freeze dry it to powder.  This product has no chemicals at all. I have given up all other artificial sweetners and have been using liquid Stevia for a few months now and absolutely love it.  I order these larger bottles because it's the best deal out there.  I pour a little bit in a smaller glass dispencer and take it with me where ever I go. The first time I ordered this I received it in a few days, but the 2nd time it took a little over a week so next time I'll order earlier if I'm running low. I convinced my mother, who is diabetic, to start using Stevia and she loves it.

review/summary: Tastes Good But Expensive
review/text: I bought two brands of stevia.  This brand and the Stevita packets.  Of the two brands, I think the Stevita packets tasted better.  I used 8 drops of sweetleaf liquid in a cup of tea and I would say that it tasted like the equivalent of 1 teaspoon of sugar, which is the amount I use.  One packet of the Stevita was too sweet.  I think I could get by with 1/2 of a packet.  They probably cost around the same amount per serving since the bottle of sweetleaf has supposedly 600 servings.  But that's probably based on the 5 drops per serving rather than the 8.<br /><br />If you've never tasted a stevia product before, I would say that it tastes a little better than nutrasweet or splenda, but not as good as sugar of course.  But it's definitely better for you than sugar, nutrasweet, or splenda.

review/text: Its so hard to find a sugar sub that doesn't have an aftertaste. This stevia really doesn't if used in moderation. I had some powder from a local health store and that was awful. With SweetLeaf, I have used it in smoothies, plain yogurt w/berries, sodas, spaghetti sauce, tea, and hot cocoa (pure cocoa powder w/milk). The cocoa wasn't great but the rest of the items came out wonderful. I did notice that if a slight aftertaste starts to form, that a few drops of lemon juice can cancel out that flavor. That I learned on accident when I tried using that old stevia powder in some chocolate cake recipe I was making. I noticed lemon tends to counter work a lot of odd flavors. Anyways, for miscellaneous sweetening, this works great!

review/summary: AN INGREDIENT CAN INTERFERE WITH MEDICATION
review/text: NOTICE TO ANY PRESCRIPTION DRUG PATIENTS ... it is not clear on most liquid stevia products how many of them (this one included) utilize "grapefruit seed extract" as an additive (typically as a natural preservative). If you take any medication that restricts or suggests avoidance of grapefruit "juice," I strongly recommend that do a bit of research before relying on the "seed extract" issue as not be included as a concern. My research has shown that grapefruit "seed extract" can have the same impact as grapefruit "juice" relative to interfering with how some medications are metabolized or absorbed. It appears they (grapefruit juice and/or seed extract) actually have the ability to render some drugs almost completely ineffective.  I have been a long term user and advocate of the positive benefits of grapefruit seed extract as a supplement (natural anti-fungal, anti-yeast, antibacterial, etc.); however, really had not expected that grapefruit "seed extract" might, in fact, end up as an unexpected additive and, more specifically, that it (seed extract) would end up showing the same evidence of drug interference as grapefruit juice does with two of the drugs I am required to take. I already knew about "no grapefruit juice" at all, but no mention of the grapefruit seed extract connection. Of course I understand that this product includes an incredibly small percentage of the seed extract, unfortunately, I haven't found any conclusive information regarding any "acceptable" amounts of the seed extract or data addressing any sort of "volume" thresholds of juice or seed extract.  I'm disappointed I can't use this product anymore (and wish I'd known this sooner and/or even thought to ask my doctor or pharmacist sooner); however, I FEEL SO STRONGLY that I should introduce this issue to anybody else this might effect regarding health recovery, maintenance, or quality of life. --  PLEASE ALSO NOTE:  I only gave one star to enable this to post (and hopefully get any appropriate individual(s)' attention). This was a five star product for me for quite some time as far as quality of taste, overall value, and excellent "blend-ability" with any kind of fluid or food ...  it really is one of the best if you have no restrictions. I'm sad I can't use this type anymore. I do now, however, use some stevita packets that I like, and am trying a couple liquids that are available that don't have the grapefruit seed extract additive (or at least not listed) ... I'll post a review if/when I find one I can confidently verify as grapefruit seed extract free.

Now this this product was a surprise it is really good if you follow the recommended portion it is not bitter and I am really enjoying it... With this product I don't need sugar anymore.
