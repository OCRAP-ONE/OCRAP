review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: Our dog, Valentine, might be a tiny baby Chihuahua, but she has TEETH! So we absolutely need to get her durable chew toys that aren't too big for her. Antlerz are PERFECT! We saw them at a local pet supply store, and the store owner showed us an antler that his french bulldog has been chewing for three months. After THREE MONTHS it was just the fat end. So we went ahead and bought two. Now our dog has one in the car and one at home, and she chews on them WHENEVER she has a chance, and there is barely any damage. They don't splinter, and they are MUCH better than Nylabones, because after our dog chews on a Nylabone for 2 hours, its shredded, but with antlers she needs to put some effort in. And they are healthy! I would recommend Antlerz to any dog owner.

review/summary: Doggie Heaven
review/text: My "chihuahua's" can't get enough of these!  One of my dogs is very prissy and dainty and the other is an athlete, so the athlete gets them started and softens them up then lets the dainty one have it...so they are in doggie heaven.  However, I know our dainty one can do it herself...but she just enjoys being catered to because she is a princess.  We buy the small size and they are great products that are worth the price...although I have seen the price increasing gradually over the months, so more people must be buying them now...We do highly recommend them.  So far, this is the best resource to get them from that we have tried.

review/summary: Good sauce, but in bad plastic container
review/text: Purchased 2 varieties of this apple sauce recently. My kids like it, and it's good to know that it's made of organic ingredients. The only thing I do not understand is why the manufacturer uses a #7 plastic jars for this apple sauce. #7 is generally regarded as "unsafe", and could potentially be  BPA type of plastic. There is plenty of information on internet about numeric symbols on plastic jars, and their risk/safety profiles. I probably will not be buying this sauce again unless the plastic container is changed to a more safer type.

I've been using them for many years now and when I make cookies, the smell and taste are to die for.  My neighbors know when I'm baking and just HAPPEN to drop in when the aroma hits the front door.

review/summary: The oils are different than the extracts... but I like them
review/text: I wanted to try oils over extracts, so I ordered this product.  Technically, it is supposed to compare to extract at 4x the density.  1oz of oil = 4oz of extract.  When I used it for the first time, I could not smell enough of the essence in my recipe while mixing.  This bothered me, so I added more.  I ended up using 1/2 a teaspoon of oil as compared to 1 teaspoon of extract that the recipe usually gets.  This ended up being about twice as much flavoring as usual.  It seems that the extracts, suspended in alcohol, are much more aromatic as the alcohol evaporates and distributes the aroma to the air better.  Once the batter began to warm up, the oil was very strong in aroma... more so than I expected.<br /><br />One note... the oil was solid in the container.  It seems it needs to be above 70'F to liquify.  Once warmed, it was a nice oil consistency.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very nice product and works well.

review/text: I've tried 15-20 different k-cups and would rate Timothy's Parisian Night (can you say French Roast) in the top third.  At the 7.25 oz setting it makes a full-bodied, dark brew with a nutty, almost earthy taste.  It's very much a European-style blend, and with a dash of half and half makes a passable Viennese 'brauner.'

review/summary: Fancy name; boring coffee
review/text: I've found Timothy's K-cups to be consistently good, better than the Green Mountain varieties I've tried (with the G.M. exceptions of Nantucket and Newman's Own.) But Parisian Night is the first Timothy's offering that didn't impress me. I bought two boxes of it from Amazon and have tried using different brew strengths, but it always tastes bland. It's bold and strong as advertised, but plebeian. To someone who's just bought a Keurig and had this blend as their first cup, it might taste pretty good; but compared with all the other, better K-cup varieties that are available, this one is better off skipped. I think it's just a fancy name for a boring blend that has nothing distinctive about it at all. Their "Midnight" dark roast is definitely more tasty, and even better than that are their Columbian and Italian K-cups, which are very smooth. I think Timothy's has the best Columbian K-cups on the market. But Parisian Night, well...let's just say that everybody makes mistakes!

review/text: I loved the flavor of this coffee....I have tried many flavors/brands over the past few months and I truly did love this coffee. MY PROBLEM with this coffee is that I spent $20 for 50 pods....out of the 50 pods, I might have only gotten 30 "drinkable" cups of coffee. I kept getting grounds in my cup. It wasnt the machine because I tried other brands/flavors and it didnt happen with those. ONLY the Parisian Nights! (AND YES, I know how to operate the machine AND NO, I didnt "open" the pods) I was so disappointed. As much as I LOVED the flavor, I would never purchase this product again....I couldnt stand the gamble of whether I would get a good cup of coffee! I am not a big fan of GROUNDS in my coffee!

review/summary: The absolute best K cup coffee available
review/text: I love espresso in the evening, and good dark American coffee in a french press in the morning. I thought Starbucks was good until I tried Alterra, which is the best for whole beans. I tried about 30 kinds of K cups after buying the machine for something faster.  I learned that the extra bolds are the only ones with much flavor, that the "espressos' are certainly not espresso, that some are too bitter and almost muddy, and I settled on the Green mountain Sumatran. It was not nearly as full flavored or as good as my french press using Alterra Brazilian bourbon coffee, but in a hurry it was much faster than grinding beans, boiling water, mixing it in the french press, and waiting 5 minutes to push down the plunger and drink the coffee. But recently when I tried to reorder, Amazon was out and I searched for a new K cup coffee. I was scientific, as I read all Amazon reviews on extra bold coffees that received almost unanimous 5 star ratings, ordering 4 of them to try: Tully's Sumatra, Van Houtte Taste of Europe 100% Colombian (I never knew Colombia was in Europe?), Caribou Mahogany, and Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights coffee. I have rated and tried them over and over and they always rank Parisian #1, Mahogany a not too distant #2, Sumatran #3, and Colombian (the lightest one) a distant #4. I then later tried Parisian against my old favorite Green mountain Sumatran, and clearly Parisian is the absoute best. It is still not as good as my french press coffee, but it has good deep flavor without bitterness and I do not feel deprived when I drink it in the morning.

If you are looking for a weak gum, this brand is not for you. It is so strong that it can clear your sinuses. The fresh, minty feeling you get from chewing a piece of this gum is simply amazing. It can quickly rid the odor and taste of even the strongest onion and garlic aftertaste. This gum also lasts for a very long time. I often grow tired of chewing before it loses its flavor. You could chew one piece of gum for 3 hours or more, and it still retains the wonderful flavor! All in all, freakin' awesome gum.

review/text: Arctic Chill.... whew!! My husband calls this one the mint bomb. It instantly made us both cough because it was so intense. We agreed we would offer this to our friends only with a preceded warning. If you wanted to clear your sinuses and all flavors (good, bad, anything, everything) chew on this. The mint bomb settles in the back of your throat (and I told him it tasted like that cooling-sensation cough syrup you can buy for sore throats). It was just so bad. The worst part, next to the intensity, was that the flavor was gone after a minute of chewing. Within 60 seconds I felt like I was chewing a tasteless blob that started to break apart. I had to find a tissue to dispose of it because there was no gum wrapper. I Love the new packaging (Split2Fit -- but no gum wrapper like my usual gum. :( I will say that i'm confident I can go into any situation smelling like I just drank strong cough syrup, rinsed with very strong mouth wash, or ate 3 pieces of average gum at once. Rest assured, you will not have bad breath. However, initially you will smell like you were doused in mint!

review/summary: Dentyne Artic Chill--BLAST away bad breath
review/text: About a week ago my husband and I were running late to meet some out of town family members. We have found our life is slightly (ok that is an understatement--ha ha) more complicated now that our daughter is a toddler and so we seem to always be in a bit of a rush.<br /><br />We were all packed into the car when I asked my husband if he brought gum (I wanted to make sure my breath was nice and fresh and I also wanted something to chew during the 1 hour drive). He did not remember to bring it, and so I had him rush back into the house and get it. I had not specified which flavor (we had a mulipack of Artic Chill, Spearmint, and Peppermint that we just bought that week to try) so he just grabbed one pack from the 3 choices.<br /><br />I did not take the time to see what flavor, and just popped 2 pieces into my mouth. I almost spit it completely out! The Artic Chill was so very VERY strong! I would describe it as Listerine flavored.<br /><br />My husband tried the gum after me, and was happy/grateful that I warned him about the extreme intensity. I would have to say that this Artic Chill flavor was my least favorite flavor. I think it should be saved for when you need to blast away offensive breath or when you are seriously worried or concerned that you will have bad breath around someone. After the initial first 10-15 minute shock of the full strength was over, I was able to enjoy this gum and my mouth felt really fresh.<br /><br />I do want to mention though, that I timed the flavor strength and it was a good 10 minutes of full blast flavor, the kind that could knock you over. If I previously had any foul or even "not freshly brushed" breath before trying this, it was certainly gone after chewing this! The flavor eventually went back to a normal minty strength within about 15 minutes and the overall flavor lasted about 30 minutes (right about the time when you want to remove gum as it begins to get harder to chew and more bland).

I have been unable to find this particular gum in my local groceries, gas stations, or other outlets (Idaho) with any regularity, so being able to order a case or two makes all the difference for me.  Thank you Amazon.com and thank you Dentyne.

review/summary: Cutter Bug-Free Concentrate is Effective on Mosquitoes
review/text: I live in an area in Minnesota where mosquitoes are numerous and extremely bothersome.  Since we have relatively short summers, I look forward to the summer season to enjoy the outdoors, but mosquitoes will literally ruin the summer season if not treated.  In addition, mosquitoes carry West Nile Disease, and a dear friend several houses away contracted this disease while working in his yard.  He was severely ill for months, and was lucky to survive.  To protect my family, I decided to take my yard back from the blood-sucking, disease-carrying demoms.  I first tried one of the mosquitoe magnet devices, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000094YKM">Mosquito Magnet MM4000 Defender Mosquito Trap</a>,but despite its great hype (and price!), it did not eliminated the biting tormentors.  I then sprayed the yard with an application of Cutter Bug-Free Backyard.  The results were stunning!  For the first time in many summer seasons, the yard was virtually free of mosquitoes. I have been using this product ever since, and am quite satisfied with it.  For me it works better than any other product I've tried.  The best feature of this product is that it both kills and then repells mosquitoes and bugs.  I have found that it lasts about 3 weeks maximum, and that is dependent on the weather.  If it rains hard after applying the repellent, I know I will have to reapply the chemical to the yard.  A light rain does not seem to affect the repellant quality. Although Cutter advertizes an 8-week mosquito-free period, this is entirely inaccurate; the product must be applied every 2-3 weeks for effective mosquito control<br /><br />The active ingredient is Permethrin.  Permethrin is extremely toxic to fish and aquatic life, so if you have a backyard pond, avoid spraying this area.  It is also highly toxic to cats, since they lick their fur and ingest the toxin.  Cutter warns to keep all pets off the lawn until the application is completely dry.  Spray the yard from the outside perimeter in.  You don't want to get the chemical on your feet, as it will cause a tingling sensation (it is a neurotoxin and is classified as a "likely" carcinogen.  There is also a link to Parkinson's disease).  Wear heavy shoes or rubber boots when applying.  Cutter instructions say to wet down the yard first, but I usually apply in the early AM when dew is still present. Avoid applying in windy conditions as you don't want this stuff blowing back on you.  Cutter says to not apply more than 14 treatments per year.<br /><br />The product is applied by using a sprayer, like Ortho, SCOTTS ORTHO DIAL N SPRAY HOSE END, and setting the dial to 1/2 oz./gallon.  Spray every single piece of greenery possible, as well as the sides of dwelling, window screens, etc.  The wider the perimeter, the better the control of mosquitoes.<br /><br />While there are risks in using any chemical, I apply the chemical carefully per instructions and avoid getting any on my body. The danger of West Nile Disease is significant in this area, and I'd rather apply Cutter's Bug-Free Backyard than avoid going outside.<br /><br />konedog

review/summary: Only solution I have found for mosquitos
review/text: I live on a salt water tidal pond on one side and deep woods on the other which breeds mosquitos like a bad dream.  I tried the mosquito magnet for a year and caught a bunch but still could not be out in the yard during the day without being attacked.  When I apply the Cutter Backyard concentrate I am able to work and play out in the yard all day without any mosquitos.  After dark the mosquitos are still pesky but my bug free time is good up until the sun goes down.  I can only treat the perimeter of my home and not all the other places they breed so I am satisfied with this product.  Also I did try malathion which works but is washed away after the first rain so I only would get a few days of protection.  Cutter Backyard lasts 4-6 weeks as long as there is not lots of heavy rain and even with that you still get 3 weeks out of it.  Been using it for 2 summers now so I know it is not a fluke.

review/summary: Killed some
review/text: This bug stuff works. Well, mostly. It killed most of the mosquitoes hovering around the windows and doors. It seemed to reduce the bugs lurking in the bushes.<br /><br />However, it wasn't anywhere near 100% effective. I'd guess closer to 60% effective in the yard, and 50% up close to the house. Also, the "staying power" was non-existent. The entire area that I sprayed down with this product was fully swarmed with mosquitoes within the next 24 hours. This was without any rain or other environmental changes.<br /><br />So, it's better than nothing. But not better than just deciding to stay inside when the bugs are thick.<br /><br />I will grant, though, that I live within 500yards of rice farms. In a more normal suburban environment, you could probably expect better results. I know I've gotten better results in previous residences.

In the past this concentrate version of the product contained .5% active ingredient and required a mixing ratio of .5oz per gallon of water.  This new version has .16% active ingredient and requires 1.5oz per gallon of water.  Reformulation by Cutter now requires the consumer to use 3 times as much to achieve the same result.

review/summary: Unknown poison shipped to residence
review/text: Cutter Bug Free Backyard is an excellent product. Use it yearly and it always helps. That's not necessarily what Amazon shipped to my home.  I received an improper bottle with a label on the front and no Manufacturer's Safety Data Sheet or any other markings, warnings, instructions that were supposed to be on the bottle.  The serial numbers were unreadable.  I didn't open the bottle in case there was tampering with the chemical inside.  Called Amazon and spent hours on the phone trying to get them to handle a potentially dangerous situation at my home.  After several hours, they agreed to refund my money but could find no way to help me get rid of the unknown substance in the bottle.  They kept referring me to "oversized packaging",which is a section of Amazon that wasn't even open for business. They also insisted that UPS could just pick up the bottle to return it.  I had to explain to them, repeatedly, that that is not permitted.  I also called UPS to make sure they knew that Amazon wanted to ship the unknown product using their service.  After hours of calls, I received an e-mail stating that they can't take the product back for health and safety reasons but were finally willing to give me back my money.  I, however, would be stuck with the product. Even after calling the manufacturer's emergency health line, they couldn't do anything without the EPA numbers that are supposed to be on an appropriate bottle.  Amazon's corporate HQ in Seattle was even less help.  They told me that they can't handle this type of issue and that no one at their HQ would assist.  I was told to call a HAZMAT removal company.  Again, I would have to pay for Amazon's mistake.  Everyone at Amazon considered it my job to pay for removal.  According to them, all the other bottles are marked properly.  They can't explain why this one wasn't or whether it had been tampered with.  I want it taken care of so that no one is injured by the contents.  Amazon suggested that offering my a $50 credit would solve the issue.  I declines their offer.  I am considering paying for the removal and filing a claim in Small Claims Court for the expense plus my time.  Perhaps public embarassment will make someone from Amazon take some responsibility.

review/summary: Finally, A Cat Grass That Grows Well!
review/text: Most cat owners know the benefits of grass for their feline's digestive health.  Animals that are strictly indoor residents don't have easy access to grass, so it's up to their owners to supplement this need for their pets.  Most pet stores carry some type of 'ready to use' oat grass, however a combination of overwatering and artificial light in stores causes heavy mold growth at the base of the grass and on the root system, limiting life of the product and producing health concerns for both pet and owner.<br /><br />To avoid such issues, I've been in search of a good cat grass to grow at home.  After going through several other exceptionally poor products, I gave the Petlinks system a try.  The system comes enclosed within a round white plastic tub and contains everything you need to grow grass (container, soil, oat seed) except water.  The instructions are simple and clear, and allow individuals with 'brown-thumbs' to produce a lush, thick green product.<br /><br />The first step is to poke some small holes in the bottom of the container.  The product instructions indicate 4-6, however since I used a very small object (turkey skewer) to make the holes I ended up making ~15 holes across all areas of the container the bottom to allow for sufficient drainage. In the second step, you plant the seeds; the product instructions indicate you "stir in the seeds, ensuring most are covered".  If that is followed as stated, it could cause variability in the extent of your yield; while you may get sufficient growth, it probably wouldn't be optimal as it would be difficult to get sufficient soil coverage of the seeds.  A better idea is to remove about 1/4" to 1/2" of soil from the container (using a tablespoon) before sprinkling the seeds on the surface of the remaining soil in the container; lightly cover the seeds with the soil you removed to complete the planting process. By doing this, it ensures all the seeds are sufficiently covered and will grow to their maximum capacity.  The final steps are to place the container on a small saucer, water the soil with 1/4 cup water, loosely place the lid on the tub, and place the entire thing in a warm dark place (I used a kitchen cupboard).  Expect to see sprouts emerge in ~3 days (it will be quite evident as they push the lid up with their growth); once that happens just remove the lid, move the entire unit to a sunny location and keep the soil slightly moist.  You'll get full growth in ~7-10 days, though it will vary as some of the seed germinate faster than others.  This is actually a benefit as it makes the system more robust and provides a thick growth of the product due to the staggered sprouting.  Best of all, cats love it!  I've had to break up a couple fights between my two cats already over the first harvest.  :)  I've posted some photos of a 10-day growth (with a ruler included for scale) so you can judge the end result for yourself.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - Easy to use<br />  - Goof-proof instructions<br />  - Thick, healthy product that grows fast<br />  - Cats love it!<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - None

review/text: My wife and I as well as other family members really like this brownie as a low calorie snack. No, it does not taste the same as the mouth watering chocolate brownies with hundreds of calories that my local bakery sells. But for a low calorie brownie it tastes pretty good. Here is why we like it.<br /><br />1. This has a soft texture, but it's not too crumbly.<br /><br />2. This has a good chocolate taste unlike some of the other low calorie chocolate items that I have tried.<br /><br />3. For me this is not too dry, but rather is moist enough.<br /><br />4. Although this is not a health food bar, it does have 5g fiber, only 8g sugar, 100mg sodium and 1.5g saturated fat. So beside being low in calories, it is not junk food.<br /><br />Shop for price. I currently buy a 38ct Box at my local Costco for just under twelve dollars.

review/summary: Nice rice!
review/text: Once upon a time, I used cheap rice for dishes.  Over time, I have discovered that there are preferable products.  This Jasmati long grain American jasmine rice exemplifies. It is one of a series of rices produced  by Rice Select.<br /><br />It has a nice texture and a nice taste once you prepare it.  When I make my recipe for fried rice from my copy of "Joy of Cooking," this is my most often used selection of rice.  The end result is tasty!  As I pour my stir fry over the fried rice, a delicious meal (well, normally) results. But a good rice base is necessary for a successful stir fry.  That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.  Yummy!<br /><br />All in all, then, this is a useful product for those who enjoy using rice in their cooking adventures!

review/text: This chai is simply fabulous. All of the flavors are delicious, but I especially love the ginger. It has a lovely lingering spiciness that I really enjoy. I am not lucky enough to have traveled to India yet, but my friends who have that have tasted this tea say that it reminds them of the "real" chai of India. It's hard to believe that a powdered drink can taste so authentic, but it really does! Yum.

review/summary: A great tasting candy bar
review/text: The 3 Musketeers bar has been a staple of the Mars candy company since it was introduced in 1932. At that time, the 3 Musketeers were three little candy bars with different flavored nougat - chocolate, strawberry and vanilla. Well, it was found that the chocolate was by far the most popular, so the other bars went away, and the 3 Musketeers became one bar.<br /><br />3 Musketeers is a great, soft candy bar that weighs in at 2.13 ounces, and has 260 calories and 8 grams of fat. It does not contain nuts, which makes it a good choice in case anyone you know has a nut allergy, and it does not contain caramel, which makes it a good choice for kids with braces. (Heck, when I had my braces, 3 Musketeers became my candy bar of choice, and it still has a favored spot in my sweet-tooth!)<br /><br />This is a great tasting candy bar, and a good choice if you are buying candy bars for others - such as a soccer team, or whatnot. I highly recommend this classic candy bar!

review/summary: Chocolate coating doesn't stick anymore
review/text: Well, I haven't really noticed a major increase in the chocolate flavor.  Personally, it was fine as it was and considered it a 4 or 5 star bar at that time.<br /><br />What I have noticed is that the outer chocolate shell doesn't seem to actually stick well to the nougat.  It peels right off.  Normally, this isn't a problem for me cuz I like to eat this candy bar in pieces, but I've noticed that the nougat seems to be dried out more times than not.<br /><br />Either, the new formula is preventing good cohesion with the chocolate shell, or we are getting the crappy rejects in our neck of the woods.

review/text: I've been eating 3 Musketeer bars for over 55 years and though they have never been my favorite, they were certainly delectable.  No more!  The new "formula" has eradicated the malt nougat and replaced it with "more chocolate."  Quite honestly, it tastes more like a bad Tootsie roll than a Musketeers.  Too bad Mars has lousy corporate judgement...I mean, do we REALLY need more chocolate?!  Frankly, I think everyone's taste-buds are selectively jaded.  I loved the creamy nougat center, and to replace it with "whipped chocolate" is selling out to marketing oversell.  I won't buy them again....ever!

review/summary: New Addiction
review/text: I'd long since given up my 3 Musketeers addiction.  I hated the "new and improved" version they switched to a few years back.  It was "1/3rd less calories" and you could definitely tell the difference.<br /><br />Enter the truffle crisp.<br /><br />It is a bizarre cross between a 3 Musketeers bar and the chocolate freeze-dried space ice cream, which I personally love.<br /><br />Since finding them around here are harder than finding real truffles, ordering online isn't a bad option.  I disagree with the previous post.  for at $0.26/oz, these come in at roughly $0.60 for the 2-stick pack. With free Prime shipping, it still works out to be far less than I do pay in the store when I can find them.<br /><br />Now, if only we could get them to make it with strawberry 'space ice cream' as a flavor too, I'd be in heaven!

review/summary: A staple in my seasoning cupboard
review/text: I buy this locally at a discount store. I have been using this flavor for years, it is my favorite. When I run low, I make sure to buy a back up. A few things I add this to: I cut up potatoes and place them in my vegetable steamer. I only use this seasoning on them, they taste incredible! I love making baked BBQ chicken. I cut up chicken breast and place it in a baking dish with a bottle of BBQ sauce. I then add this seasoning over the chicken, it is so good! I have added it to my egg salad mix, garden salads, tuna steak, you name it. You can't go wrong with it. I do not have high blood pressure but it does not hurt that it is salt free. The flavor is so full on so many items. The other day I had a friend over and he uses sour cream when eating any chips. He asked for the table blend to shake over the sour cream. Seemed odd to me but actually tasted good!

If they will be used in a sauce, dip in hot water for a minute and then into the sauce they go - quick stir, stir, and then you are done. Don't overcook.<br /><br />Enjoy!

My dog loves this as he munches up all the little noodles bit that break apart to the floor. To make this less annoying...<br />1)Put a large tupperware dish in your sink that will fit the remaining dry noodles and the pot you will cook them in next to your sink<br />2)Pull the whole clump of noodles out of the package over the sink and place in dish<br />3)Tear out the portion you want and place it in your pot then cook as usual<br /><br />This greatly cuts down the mess of noodles all over the counter, floor, stove top. My pup isn't quite as happy with the results but I am :)

review/summary: genuinely tasty whole-grain pasta
review/text: My 7-yr old even loves this pasta (sometimes complains if we're not having "brown noodles!")  I'm a big fan of traditional pasta, but if I'm working to get some, oh, healthy calories into at least one meal out of the day? this is a very easy way to do it.  A full day's worth of whole grains in one serving--doesn't get better than that!  There are several types of grain in the ingredients, not just whole wheat.<br /><br />It should be noted that this does not have the taste of regular pasta--I doubt that could ever be done.  But it does taste good!  It is its own kind of noodle, and for some dishes I don't know how I'd like it (baked pasta, for instance, though I haven't tried.)  It goes well with sauce. It is very good with just a little butter, salt and pepper (go for sea salt for the best results.)  The texture is similar to regular angel hair, which is in my opinion essential. It's just a little more fragile uncooked and slightly less chewy.  Five stars for a terrific product!

review/summary: This is an exceptional beef bouillon maker that is healthy for you to use!
review/text: We use this bouillon to add to our meals for multiple reasons. You can add this beef flavored bouillon and it adds flavor to your meal without adding fat and provides an ideal bouillon to use to make gravy with or to use as a basting sauce to roast or broil your meat in. You are buying all the flavor and you add your own water to make it as concentrated as you would like. You can dissolve the bouillon powder in hot water and pour it into you food to cook it or simply stir it in without any water at all. You can even add it to vegetables to get a beef flavor added to them.<br /><br />This is great tasting, fast to make, and it is made by Hormel. It contains only 2 carbs, 1 sugar and 1 protein per serving. But here is the best part, it is:<br /><br />* Gluten free<br />* Sodium Free<br />* MSG Free<br /><br />If you are on a low salt and low fat diet then this is the ideal product for you. We use it all the time and it tastes good and we like the benefits that it brings to our meals as far as added flavor without some of the negative factors that you can get with other brands. It lets you use less oil and butter while cooking and still make a tasty meal. We like this product and we believe you will to.

Here's a little treat:<br />I dump the product into a Tupperware container and flatten the box for safekeeping in case I need to refer to it for instructions or nutritional info.<br />I place 4 heaping tablespoons of mix in a small microwave bowl. (A Pyrex bowl seems to work better for this, as there is less sticking.) Then I add 4 heaping spoonfuls of water. (With this snack method, you don't need butter or oil.) Batter will be a bit runny, but mix well until all batter lumps have dissolved. Microwave on high for approximately 1 minute. Microwaves vary so you'll have to rely on trial and error to make the right time choices. Anyhow, the finished product is yummy with a few scoops of fat free frozen yogurt, some spoonfuls of cherry pie filling (or cherry preserves in a pinch,) topped off with a bit of chocolate syrup. The combination of these ingredients make a highly 'naughty' tasting lowfat treat. Enjoy!

review/text: No dissapointments here. It is low fat but tasty. I have been making individual portions so far with the first box and then serving it warm from the microwave with ice cream. A delicious treat and a controlled size.It arrived in excellent condition and we will enjoy this product for the next several months, perfect for a picnic treat also.

review/summary: Yum
review/text: Items arrive promptly and in good shape<br /><br />These are very tastie for boxed brownies, probably the best of the bunch.<br /><br />This is a different formula for the low fat, now sure how they differ, but they differ from the regular<br /><br />I got so much guff from people because i ordered a dozen brownie mixes, but I don't care

review/summary: Simply the best
review/text: I have been loyally making only this variety of brownie for several years but can no longer get the mix from local grocery stores, so I buy it here in bulk.  I always get compliments - I bring them to practically every function - and nobody can ever guess that they're low-fat.  The only down side is that it's easy to eat more because they're so delicious and you tend to justify that they're better for you!

review/summary: Great flavor, consistent quality, outstanding chocolate.
review/text: If you are considering ordering a 12 pack of the Lindt Excellence Intense Orange Dark Chocolate Bars, you probably already know they are extremely tasty and very satisfying. They are my favorite decadent treat right now. I've ordered several of the 12 packs over time because my local stores in Upstate New York keep going out of stock on this item.<br /><br />The 12-pack is well shipped in box that is suitable to break open for display in a retail setting and it works great for home use too. I've never had a broken candy bar in my orders from Amazon and the bars are dated almost a year in the future so they are fresh and will keep for a long time to come. I've been ordering in the fall and winter this year with no problems. If you order in the summer just keep a look out so the box doesn't sit out on a hot doorstep in the sun where the candy might get too soft.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with ordering these bars from Amazon and will continue to do so in the future as long as the conditions remain the same. Highly recommended!!!

review/summary: OMG! This is heaven!
review/text: OMG! This is heaven! Dark creamy chocolate with slivers of almond and orange zest. This is an intense chocolate experience. Someone gave me a taste at work, and I just ordered a dozen so I can have it all to myself!<br /><br />It has an exquisite taste!<br /><br />Updated 5/12/11<br />I came back to order another batch, when I saw that the price went from $27(eligible for free shipping) on 3/17/11 to $47 plus shipping. When the price on the on the product fluctuates I use a price alert tool. This is a nice online tool that I use to help catch a good price on Amazon, this tool is called "Online Price Alert". This tool will send you an email when the Amazon item price reaches the target price range that you specify. If you search on "online price alert" in Google it will be come up at the top. I find this tool to be very helpful.<br /><br />Updated 7/6/11<br />I discovered that Lindt Stores sometimes have a shelve with 'seconds' which means the mixture of ingredients is a bit off but you cannot detect the difference in the taste unless you are a professional taster. I could not. These seconds go for 10 bars for $15. Can't beat that for a totally amazing chocolate.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: Great chocolate but these are available for $1.99 in any decent supermarket. Paying $3.50 - $8.48 per 3.5 oz plus shipping is simply foolish.

review/summary: Intense indeed!
review/text: Recently I made some homemade lip balm with a chocolate/orange/truffle scent, and since I use it all the time, the intense scent was driving me mad; I kept wanting to eat the lip balm.  So I came to Amazon to see what they might have to help me out with this problem, and ordered this product.  (I know Lindt is high quality; I used to eat it all the time when I was younger.)  Delish!  It is a perfect thing to nibble on when I've just put on the lip balm!

review/text: I too am from NY and this is by far the best brand on the market. I wish they sold it locally here in NC. I miss just being able to buy it at the grocery store. You get a lot for the money too. it's a BIG jar not those itty bitty ones they sell here at the market. You get Quality and Quantity! BEST buy!

review/text: Yep, another displaced New Yorker.  Californians can't even imagine what Duck Sauce is!!  This is a wierd state.  I grew up on Dai Day and my family has been sending me jars now and then.  Well it's summer BBQ season.  Dai Day on ribs and pork chops is just killer. I'm glad Amazon has the "Good Taste" to sell Dai Day.

review/summary: Best duck sauce in America
review/text: My wife and I originally were introuced to Dai Day Duck Sauce in New York over 40 years ago at a barbaque.  The ribs and chicken had the most wonderful sweet and punjent taste ever in our memories.  For many years we lived in South Florida and were able to purchase it at our local supermarket.  We now live in Asheville North Carolina and none of the major chains carry it.  We purchased Dai Day from Amazon and were thankful that we still can get this great item.  There are NO substitudes for this item.
