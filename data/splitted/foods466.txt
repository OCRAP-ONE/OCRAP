review/summary: One of the VERY BEST!
review/text: This is a very dark, rich, unsweetened cocoa from Italy that has a great fat content (20-22%) with the added touch of vanilla beans. It is like no other cocoa you have ever cooked or baked with. It is Dutch processed. It has the most intense, immediate chocolate flavor when you smell it, so you can well imagine what it does for all your recipes.Treat yourself and keep this cocoa powder in your repertoire.

review/summary: Best Baking Chocolate
review/text: I bake about 5-10 times a month.  This is the most intense chocolate I have ever used.  Even when opening the bag, the smell you are met with tells you what high quality chocolate this is.  I have already used this for two different cakes, and it provides a rich, well balanced flavor.  It is worth the investment for baking.

review/summary: pernigotti cocoa very good
review/text: I was looking for an above average cocoa powder for baking. I ordered pernigotti cocoa from ChefStop through Amazon. It took longer to get here than I expected; I would not order from them if I was in a rush. However, the cocoa is very good, and is definitely superior to the run of the mill brands that you find in an ordinary supermart. I have used it in both baked items, as well as candy. The flavor is rich, and a bit "dark", making it impossible to eat just one piece. I definitely recommend the product, and I would (and probably will) order from this vendor in the future as long as I am not up against a deadline.

review/summary: Awesome Cocoa
review/text: To compare this product, I made two batches of Chocolate Ice Cream.  Identical recipe, only one had Ghiradelli cocoa and the other, this Pernigotti Cocoa.  We could immediately taste the flavor difference. The Pernigotti ice cream had a much more "chocolaty" taste to it. Well worth the money if you're a chocolate fan.

review/text: Kicking Hershey's Dark to the curb. Turning my nose up at Scharfenberger. Pernigotti rocks. I use it to make my own paleo type chocolate. Tastes like Oreos.<br /><br />Did a blind taste test amongst the three- weighed the chocolate, measure everything to keep it a legit trial. Pernigotti wons hands down.<br /><br />Just what I needed- another expensive habit.<br /><br />The shipping took awhile but Amazon advised that it would. However, it did arrive 1 day earlier than anticipated.<br /><br />So good!

review/summary: Great Chocolate Flavor
review/text: I used this to make some high quality chocolate ice cream using David Lebowitz recipes. The smell of the powder is beautiful and gives you an impression it will contribute wonderful flavors.<br /><br />I used this on a recipe that included 6 ounces of high quality chocolate from El Rey. The chocolate came out tasting chocolatey, a little bitter from the chocolate itself, and slightly sweet. Overall I was happy with the chocolate flavor in that it was extremely dominant. I prefer to get a true chocolate taste rather than a super sweet chocolate taste. So if your looking for dominant chocolate tones buy this chocolate!

review/text: If you like to bake; as I do, quality ingredients are a must!  This cocoa powder is the best.  From the first time I tried it from Wms-Sonoma, I was hooked!  There was no turning back for me.  I could not imagine using anything else.  Yes, it is expensive, but so worth it.  I am not a chocolate enthusiast like some, but I do make chocolate desserts from time to time, and Pernigotti does not disappoint.  I don't know how good this is, but I store mine in the big freezer, wrapped up several times.  I have a smaller, air-tight container, that I keep handy in my little freezer, that I re-fill as needed.  A bag usually lasts me a year.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Best Dutch-Processed Cocoa Powder!
review/text: Honestly, this is the best Dutch-processed cocoa powder out there.  I was introduced to this product many years ago at Williams Sonoma.  They no longer carry it, but I did find it on a few websites using the search engine.  This cocoa powder will give your baked goods that deep, dark, intense chocolate you are looking for when your recipes call for Dutch-processed cocoa powder.  I use it not only for baked goods, but in uncooked recipes as well.  I make a homemade version of a chocolate Lara Bar that I use this cocoa powder for.  The taste is one of rich chocolate fudge.  Give it a try - I know you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Knock-your-socks-off cocoa!
review/text: I feel so lucky to work near the ChefShop store. A few years ago I was there, shopping for Christmas gifts. They had a hot chocolate machine going and I helped myself to a cup - it was so delicious and amazing! Well, there was no better sales pitch for this cocoa powder. Though the bag looked generic and unpromising, I bought 2 for gifts and one for myself. Since then I won't buy any other cocoa powder. Yes, it makes incredible hot chocolate but maybe even more importantly, dramatically transformed my chocolate baked goods into sublime, luxurious treats. The intense chocolate flavor is well balanced, with no bitterness whatsoever. If you like sea salt's purity of flavor, you'll probably like Pernigotti Cocoa. It seems a little expensive but a little goes a long way and is a great value. Just try making your favorite chocolate cake recipe with it and you might find it as indispensable as I do.

review/summary: NOT for ice cream
review/text: I'm here looking for a Dutch process cocoa because I want it for ice cream.  Was considering this one until I saw it was lightly 'dutched'.  The problem with regular cocoa and, I assume this as well, is the oils from the cocoa remain in the powder.  When you try to make ice cream, the oils cause the cocoa to 'pill' leaving specks of chocolate globules in the ice cream.  Tastes OK, just doesn't present well.  The search continues.

Texture reminds me of a bean sprout-crunchy, not rubbery. They soften a bit when cooked. I stirred some into a bok choy stir fry, and they kind of disappeared into the crunchy veggies. Very filling. The bag recommends them in salads. That makes sense. I can imagine a sesame ginger dressing and some shredded carrot, no problem. $2.99 a pound where I am, from Sea Tangle Noodle Company. I think these will definitely replace some or all of my shirataki purchases. But don't plan to put spaghetti sauce on them.

review/text: These noodles are great. I don't like pasta, but I love these in the way that people use pasta, not with spaghetti sauce,though. They are refreshing, have a great consistency and texture, and are filling (even though they have hardly any calories/no carbs). I tasted them raw and they were crunchy, like bean sprouts and highly enjoyable; but I wanted to put them in veggies and saute in broth. I added them to a little chopped onion, garlic, sun dried tomatoes, roasted red pepper, frozen spinach and chicken broth. Cooked for a few minutes-absolutely delicious. I just ordered three more packs.<br /><br />Along with the original order of the Kelp noodles, I ordered the Shiritaki noodles-they are awful. Will probably toss what I have left and never order them again. I have to find a store that sells Kelp noodles near me, because now I'm pretty addicted to them.

review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/summary: Best cookies in the world
review/text: These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.

review/summary: broken cookies
review/text: I bought these cookies for myself and as a gift for my dad for his birthday. Unfortunately, 2 out of 4 of the boxes I gave my dad as a gift had mostly broken cookies, and were stale tasting. Not a great gift idea, and not really packaged or handled well. I have bought the delice cookies in the past and had no problems other than a random broken cookie in a box. I have not opened all of the boxes yet of course, but will hope to find a couple that are not all broken up to give to my dad.

review/summary: Light, Flaky & Tasty GOOD Cookie!!
review/text: I really like these cookies.  They are made with pastry dough - lots of thin, flaky, crispy layers with a very light coating of honey (or something like honey).  The jelly center rounds the cookie out with a delicious bite of sweetness. It's a robust burst of flavor that makes you want to smile. I am rapidly getting addicted to these fine flavorful confections -- bet you can't eat just one!

review/summary: Rather Bland
review/text: I am an adventurous person who likes new things and when Amazon began selling the Bahlsen line I tried a number of their products and found them to be enjoyable and tasty, but the Hannover Wafer Cookies are, to my palate, rather bland and tasteless. The texture is pleasing, though a little grainy tasting and the creme filling has little flavor. They're very high in saturated fat, and  devoid of flavor..Think I'll stick with the Bahlsen Delobas'.

review/summary: These "Butter Leaves" are addictively wonderful!
review/text: Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!

review/summary: Delicious but Hot!
review/text: I have been looking everywhere for some Homemade Hot & Sweet Pepper Relish like my Aunt used to make. I have tried several brands when I ran across this brand made by Amish Buggy. I knew that it probably would taste about the same after I read about it and its ingredients so I decided to give it a try. It arrived today and while I have not eaten any of it with a meal yet, I did open the jar and taste it and it was exactly what I was looking for. It has to be the closest that I have ever came to my Aunts Relish. I will be ordering again in the near future! Let me warn you though that it is extremely hot! I would not recommend it if you have Ulcers or IBS or some other stomach issues and definitely would not recommend it for Children as it is just way too hot for them. But if you like a hot relish then you would absolutely love this one! Great job Amish Buggy, you have a repeat customer here!

review/summary: Spicy and sweet, perfect condiment for spicy tuna salad, etc!
review/text: I've ordered 3 of these jars so far. I fell in love with the first jar and followed up with an order of 2 more jars. My brother tried it and loved it, too. It does have a good heat kick to it. I love to put it in the tuna salad that I make. Sometimes I want it pretty spicy so I put a heaping tablespoon in. At other times, I only want a little spice, so I put maybe half that amount.  It is also good as relish on hotdogs! I can't see myself not ever having this delicious stuff on-hand ever again.

review/summary: A Touch of Elegance
review/text: It's absolutely amazing how adding a simple dab of sugar can make a cupcake pop! The thing about this product is its vibrance, which quite frankly makes the grocery store brand seem dull. It's as if they infused in granule with as much Red-5 that they could pack in. Mind you sugar and artificial coloring aren't the best things for you, but they make for fun times with food. Would I recommend you to buy it, sure would. After all what do you have to lose, the bottle is cheaper then your store brand and with amazon prime there's no trip to be made to the store.

review/summary: Suprisingly creamy, refreshing
review/text: When you see a diet soda, it usually implies a funky taste.  However, sucralose sweetened beverages such as this Hansen's don't have such a problem.  As an added bonus, the ingredients in this soda have a quality taste to them.  A premium soda that doesn't sock you with a lot of calories that may come back to haunt you.  If you are a fan of root beer, try this one for sure!

review/summary: Dang good root!
review/text: This diet root beer has earned a rock-solid four stars. The only reason I'm withholding a star, is that I recall the authentic root beers of my youth [e.g., Hires], and reserve the ultimate rating for them. This beverage delivers a crisp, clear, and creamy sasparilla taste, and does it with no discernible aftershock. Try this stuff...you'll like it. Delivered to your door, at 75 cents a pop, you can't go too awfully wrong!

review/summary: The BEST root beer!
review/text: It is great tasting, in fact the best root beer I have ever had. My doctor and physical therapist both strongly suggested that I remove all aspartame from my diet, including my beloved Diet C-- to which I was 'addicted'. While searching for a non-aspartame, no sugar soft drink, I found Hansen's Diet Root Beer while visiting in the great North West. The cane sugar version is available in my area in the health food section as it is all natural but I have been unable to locate the Diet Root Beer. No worries - I simply order it from Amazon. I do wish they would replace the Splenda with a stevia sweetener, making the Diet Root Beer all natural also.

It's easy to experiment with by adding more spices, veggies, different meats, and even usable with TVP (not my thing). Try it and enjoy.

review/text: Very easy to fix with a can of tomatoes and some chicken, pork or shrimp.  The seasonings are flavorful and the rice cooks up nicely, unlike instant rice which has an odd extruded look and feel.  It is quite salty though - more salty than I like.  I have been using sodium free tomatoes and, of course, not salting the water.  I will eat the boxes I have but will not order more due to the excessive salty taste.

Of everything I have tried, Maynard's Wine Gums are by far my favorite. I have even tried the other brands, like Bassett's Wine Gums, but they simply do not compare. The flavors of Maynard's are more tart, and the gummy consistency is perfect. I am so glad to have found them here on Amazon!
