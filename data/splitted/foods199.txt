review/text: Yeah, I know i spelled artesanal wrong, but too lazy to look it up. PB & Co in NYC is awesome, and I visited the store all the time when I lived in Greenwich Village. I am currently backpacking and these packets are excellent for on the go. I highly recommend for hikers and other travelers as they provide protein, calories, energy, etc. Otherwise, if you buy the jars, this is a great flavor, but slightly better are the white chocolate and the maple syrup (very best).

review/summary: Taste is okay, squeeze packaging is not recommended
review/text: The item itself is in a squeeze pack and that does not work very well with peanut butter. The instructions say to knead the individual package before opening... whatever that means?  I did move the content of the package around before opening.  But so much of it remained in the package when I tried to use it. Effectively I got about a spoon full out of the package and could not squeeze the rest out.  So I opened the package and licked the insides to enjoy the rest.  It got quite messy.  The taste was okay, but not great, and no funny aftertaste of anything. If I tasted it in the store, I would not have purchased it.  I will eat the rest of the squeeze packs, but I have no plans to order them again or recommend them. To others that feel the need to eat this stuff, I would recommend a bottle and specifically not the squeeze pouches.  I also believe it would be too difficult for a child to use at school, even a middle school child.  With normal items such as juice/toothpaste in a squeeze pack, when you squeeze the contents move away and your fingers come very close to each other.  With peanut butter, you squeeze your fingers but the peanut butter does not move towards the top. So it just does not work well.  I wanted to love this stuff -- oh well.<br />---<br />A month later I have come back to re-rate this product.  I have about 13 packs left out of the initial 20.  I hate eating them, it makes a mess, it is hard to use, and the taste is not that great.  I will likely be throwing them out soon.  I do not recommend this product.  And I LOVE chocolate!!!!!!!!!!!

This is great for anyone watching calories or on Weight Watchers since it's 1/2 the calories of regular mayo but still it's all natural and much better than regular.  Use to make chicken salad, put some on chicken and broil or pan "fry."  A little goes a long way so you get all the pleasure of mayo with none of the guilt.<br /><br />I want to marry this product I love it so much!

Just the shrimp and the mayo. I'd forgotten how great mayo could be since I've cut back so much on it with the full calorie stuff. I agree it has a lot of cracked black pepper as others have mentioned, but that's what makes it so good. Can't wait to put it on a turkey sandwich!

review/summary: The Ultimate Condiment
review/text: Kraft Mayo with Olive Oil and Cracked Pepper takes a little getting used to. It is a "lite" mayo so it has that slight difference from regular mayonnaise. It is not quite as rich and has more of a lemon flavor. The cracked pepper is prominent in the mayo. I can see why some reviewers were put off. Only order this if you are used to a heavy black pepper dose on your food. That said, I find this condiment a fantastic replacement for regular mayo in nearly every application. It is mind blowing on a sandwich and just as good on salads and veggies. If you are partial to sliced tomatoes in your sandwich, then you are in for a real treat. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Best tasting condiment besides Heinz Ketchup
review/text: First off I'm a huge Heinz Ketchup fan and never thought I could like a condiment as much as that but let me tell you this ranks right up there!! I believe the balance of Mayo, Olive Oil, and Black Pepper is perfect, not too spicy like the previous reviewer stated and this is coming from me who cannot eat anything spicy at all.  Sometimes I'll combine both Heinz Ketchup and the Cracked Black Pepper Mayonaise to create a very tasty addition to plain and boring sandwiches.  I also like to add Soy Sauce or Terryaki Sauce to add it to make an Asian Style Creamy Sauce to add to Chicken or Steak dinners.  I'll just add on a closing note I was not a huge fan of Mayonaise before I tried this but I have to say I am a HUGE fan now!

review/summary: This is nasty!!! Even if you like pepper on your sandwich! Beware!
review/text: I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.<br />I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey, turkey bacon, avocado, tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and then this mayo... The only thing I tasted was this mayo!!! It overpowered the whole sandwich. I didnt even use that much either... I was starving so I choked down this sandwich. Then I sat and drank, drank, drank some more just to get the pepper out of my mouth!! This was horrible...<br />Then I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he spit it out!! He was like man what are you trying to do, poison me with pepper! I told him that is the mayo you had me buy with the cracked pepper in it. He said throw that jar away and get the regular olive oil mayo. This stuff is nasty!!<br />I understand that everyone has their own opinion of food but this is really hot and overpowering with pepper. Like one reviewer said that it has cracked pepper in it so why would you buy it if you dont like pepper. I like pepper and my boyfriend loves pepper but this went in the trash!

review/text: If you love mayo and a touch of black pepper then this is not for you. You are better off with just your regular mayo and adding your own sprinkle of pepper. This stuff is downright hot. There is so much pepper that you can not taste the mayo. The mayo flavor is lost even if you only use a little bit of it. However some like it hot, so they may fall in love with it. It was too strong for me.

review/text: I bought this on a whim at my local grocery store, and to my surprise it is the best alfredo sauce I have ever tried!  It has a great texture, a little thicker than common store brands, and a big peppercorn kick.  I've also found a lot of store brands are a bit too "cheesy" for my tastes; this sauce is robust and deep without making your pasta taste like Mac n' Cheese.  If you're not a peppercorn fan, this sauce may not be for you, but otherwise give it a try!

review/summary: mediocre taste, hilariously misleading packaging
review/text: I admit I bought a box of these at an Organic Sensitive Aware Health food grocery store, so I expected it to be expensive. However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4"H x 6 1/2"W x 1 1/2" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2" inch long) foil packet is just under 3" long, less than 1/2" wide, & 3/8" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.<br /><br />Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.<br /><br />In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says "Still Hungry?"  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar-lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box.

To my 8 year old who has a life threatening allergy to nuts and can't have bars with tree nuts or made on shared equipment with tree nuts, he thinks they are great.  He actually likes them and that's what matters.  He can have peanut butter (legumes) but all the bars are made on shared equipment with tree nuts!  So Enjoy Life is our pricey brand of choice for convenience snacks and granola.  They should make a pumpkin seed bar or mix the two.  And up the protein for a protein snack bar since that's what the kids who can't have the nut bars need.

review/summary: Where's the beef?
review/text: I've purchased a few of the Enjoy Life faux-cookie products and although the price and quantity were hard to digest, I thought the taste was more than tolerable. I returned the faux-granola because it was too hard; a bowl of pebbles, literally! But it may have been on the store shelf too long. BTW, you can't see inside the package, or any other Enjoy Life package for that matter. Then, the Perky's Rice Crunch I purchased and enjoyed for months changed, the label had the Enjoy Life logo on it--and 2 ounces less product at a higher price! Okay, the times they are a'changin' and I moved on. Last week I purchased the "Chewy on the go Bars, Sunbutter Crunch." The taste was good; what more do I deserve! However, it was a marketing triumph: four dollars and forty nine cents for 5 diminutive bars, at least compared to the packaging. The bars are about two thirds the size of the foil wrap they come in! Add in the dead space in the box and you got what used to be referred to as "a rip off." In a health food store no one can hear you scream.

I expected bull pizzles, but it seems all of the "Red Barn" brand Chew-A-Bulls are reconstituted and not real pizzles. They have gone to great lengths to make the product look like a real bull pizzle, but they are not the real thing and do not last like the real thing. I knew something was wrong when my dog had devoured it within minutes. Close inspection revealed flashing from the mold used to form them and the ends were smooth and uniform, unlike a real pizzle.<br />Bull pizzles aren't particularly cheap, and neither are the cheap imitations like these.<br />I truly felt like I had been deliberately deceived, enough so to warn others.

review/summary: Beware: this is doggy junkfood, not a bullystick
review/text: Bought one of these from a pet store for my dog. I always try to give her natural minimally-processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews.  The label didn't say what this was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried bull anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor-free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort of soft & chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick.  My 20lb bicha-poo ate the whole 12" stick in about a half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that it's not natural meat at all but a man-made "fake" bully stick.  Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid.  I won't be buying these again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last.

review/text: Be careful that you know what you are getting.  i have a bichon frise, and a 12" bull stick is a bit long for her to handle.  the written description says each bull stick is 6", which is what i wanted.  the package shows more than one, whereas i received one 12" stick for that price.  much too long for a smaller dog.

review/text: So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that "Almond" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to "Buttery French Toast", as this would be much better fitting.

review/summary: Unique product, well executed
review/text: The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

review/text: If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are "meaty" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!

review/summary: Not the same as the canned version
review/text: I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond "Roasted Almonds - Honey" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very "off" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and "other natural flavors", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond "Honey Roasted Almonds" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not "slivered" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned "Honey Roasted Almonds" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased.

review/text: This is basically candy masquerading as a "healthy" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack.

review/summary: Yummy in my Tummy :)
review/text: I ordered these lovely almonds a few weeks ago, as I often find myself jonesing for junk food, and I thought that if I had something that was good for me around, I would be less likely to grab something terrible.  These nuts are packed with nutrition, and they taste amazing.  They have just enough flavor to make me want more, but the fact that they are high in fat makes it difficult to eat too many in one sitting; I'm satiated with two handfuls.  I go through one little container every week or so.  They are perfect for anyone concerned with nutrition or trying to put on or keep muscle- they pack 6 grams of protein in 1 oz.  I will definitely be re-purchasing these nuts. I wasn't so keen on the idea of the canisters, as I don't like producing so much waste, but I have purchased nuts (peanuts etc) in the past in bulk, and they did go bad before I finished eating them.<br />These nuts have kept me out of the icecream, chocolate chips, and other naughty sweet things that have little nutritional content.  These nuts taste like they should be bad for you, but they are more similar to vitamins than junk food; read the back for the nutritional content: 35% Vitamin E, 15% Phosphorus, 20% Magnesium, 35% Manganese....the list goes on...:)<br /><br />Update: I ordered my second shipment of these.  I love these and I eat a handful of these almonds after my morning banana yogurt shake and with my vitamins :)

review/text: These are incredible!  Eating these makes me not want to eat candy.  I love these!  The price isn't that great though.  I think Blue Diamond should save money by packaging them in something cheaper than plastic.  I did notice it on Amazon in a box, but the price looks odd - over $50?  Too bad Amazon doesn't stock this, so no Free Shipping.

review/summary: Butter Toffee almonds are sooo good, but hi-carb
review/text: I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception.

review/summary: The best almonds on earth!!!
review/text: I must say, these almonds have made me a lover of nuts!!!  I have always been a cashew girl and never cared that much for almonds. Well, being on a low carb diet made cashews a no no.  Almonds roasted only with sea salt are soooo good. Blue Diamond makes the best tasting and these are hard to find in stores.  I love the 1 lb bag of these, but can't seem to find them. Buying these in bulk was the best deal out there and I will have to purchase again.  Thanks, Blue Diamond for a superior nut!

review/text: So the hottest-hot-off-the-press recommendation is an ounce of almonds a day will help keep the doctor away.... and for good reason.  They're full of B (and other) vitamins, fiber, --not-cholesterol, not-sodium, not-empty calories, and not tasteless wallpaper paste....<br /><br />But these --- these new Blue Diamond almonds (I've so far tried both the Brown Sugar Cinnamon and the Vanilla -- are soooooo good that it's hard to stop at an ounce.  This has become my after-dinner treat.<br /><br />To help fight the sodium bugaboo, they've instead coated them with a velvet dairy whey based powder (take note, lactose-intolerant folks) that is loaded with flavor.  They're not sweet -- except the sweetness of the lactose.  And they're not the least bit salty.  They taste like a great dessert in both flavor and texture.<br /><br />Thumbs way up -- licking my fingers kind of up.

review/summary: NOT as good as the ones in the tins
review/text: Local retailers stopped carrying the Blue Diamond Honey Roasted Almonds in the small tins for some time now.  Not planning ahead enough to buy another case, I picked up these in hope that "oven roasted" + "honey" = that same goodness.  NOT TRUE.  These almonds are cloyingly sweet.  They also taste a bit milky, but there are no milk products listed, which just makes the flavor even stranger.  They don't have that crusted on goodness of the tin ones.  However, my 6 year old really likes them and, while I don't have a container to compare, I'm thinking that the lack of crusty goodness *might* make these a somewhat healthier choice for her.  So I give the product 3 stars -  an average of 5 from her and 1 from me.

review/text: These wintergreen mints are my family's all time favorite, and they don't contain the additives we're trying to avoid. My friends and family have had the hardest time finding these at our local health stores, so subscribing to them is sooooo convenient. Organic & Tasty, THANK YOU Amazon & Newman's Own!

review/summary: Best mint ever!
review/text: Newman's Own Organic Mints in Wintergreen are my all time favorite mints EVER! I was a frequent Trident bubble gum chewer up until I found out that it contained Aspartame and was on a rabbit hole chase ever since to find a gum replacement that could hold the taste (minus Aspartame)and not harden after a minute. I still have not found one but then I tried Newman's Own several months ago and now it is my all time favorite product. It tastes refreshing, freshens breathe, all natural ingredients and safe enough to give to my young son. This is an AWESOME little mint that is hard to find in stores, so I'm very grateful Amazon carries it.

review/summary: These are the best mints and no aspartame or BHT
review/text: I was so shocked to find out that almost all gums have BHT.  I went to the health food store and got gum with Xylitol but I didn't like the taste.  B Fresh was the only one with Xylitol that didn't taste like aspartame.  I saw Newmans Own Organic Mints and was happy to see no aspartame or BHT and they are really good.  I hope the company starts making gum.  The only problem is the mints are made in Mexico.  What is the matter Americans can't make mints?

review/text: after using Altoids for some time, i decided to try these, as the polar bear attracted me to the tin. they mints themselves look like little home-made cylinder peanutbutter cookies. did not expect them to freshen my breath. wrong. they freshen your breath (as long as you did not just eat sushi, in that case you'd need at least 3) but they taste amazing and do freshen you up

review/text: These mints come in a beautiful tin and are fresh-tasting wintergreen.  Try wintergreen over peppermints or spearmints and you will never go back!  Organic too from a reputable supplier (Newman's Own).  These are a regular in our household.

review/summary: Munchkin Love
review/text: These little toddler meals are simple, easy, and best of all, loved by my little munchkin (17 months old).  She lives two hours away with her mother, who is in college, so I send these meals to her apartment so that she has them there, as well as when she's with me (every other week).  They may be a little costly and not on a college student's budget, but I'm happy to ensure that my little munchkin has healthy meals that she loves and that make her feel independent (she can feed them to hershelf).  The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler to pick up with tiny fingers or a spoon and put in their mouth.  No "choking" incidents to date.

review/summary: For the Carrot Lovers!
review/text: My 1 year old LOVES carrots.  Raw, cooked, mushy, firm, it doesn't matter.  This tray has cooked carrots that can be heated up to make warm, slightly firm carrot chunks that she can pick up by herself.  She also loves to feed herself and this is perfect to just give to her.<br /><br />We love the Gerber Graduates.  They smell great and taste great, yes I have eaten them too.  These are just plain cooked carrots in water.  I haven't found anything from this line that she will not eat.

review/summary: YOUR DOGS WILL LOVE THIS FOOD! IMPRESSIVE INGREDIENTS
review/text: My 11 dogs love this so I say it is great! The tiny ones (toy poodles) get the almost straight food. The others get this mixed with their Bil-Jac. I am impressed with the ingredients. Not full of corn! Another thing I noticed... Every time I have fed my dogs any brand of straight canned dog food, with the exception of Science Diet, they had diarrhea. Not with this one. Not even one of them had it. That's a good thing. I ordered two more cases and will continue. The price is reasonable too and free shipping with Amazon Prime or free shipping with purchase over 25.00. I also ordered the chicken with rice and the dog food for all life stages.  My dogs love them all the same. I had never purchased food with lamb in it before but the one for life stages has it. i do not like the way veal or lamb are treated and have never eaten it myself either. However,having said that, I will be ordering this monthly for my dogs. Just wish there were more choices without lamb. It is impressive that their cattle are free range grazing cattle and fish are ocean not farm raised. I believe my dogs are eating better than us! Seriously, you will be impressed with the ingredients list on these foods.

review/summary: Warning this product may contain a doggy stimulant
review/text: First things first, unfortunately there is not an option for "Dog Loves It" on Amazon's reviews so I hope this is not misleading...I personally have never eaten the stuff so this should not be viewed as "I like this" and I haven't been able to teach my dog to verbally communicate yet so I'm going to have to go off of body language cues. That being said....15 month old, female German Shepherd with a sensitive stomach seems to love it. Had her on it for 5 months now. Half a can mixed with your dry food of choice 2X a day and you'll have a pretty darn wild dog at and post feeding time. Just bought a pack of the chicken grain free to see if it elicits equal enthusiasm. Inevitably, some of the cans always wind up at my doorstep dented, but I don't think that has any impact on the product.

review/summary: My dogs love it, and love the combination beef and fish!
review/text: I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan "all the time", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it.

review/summary: All but 2 cans in the case were severely damaged
review/text: I purchase most of my dog food from Amazon and, until this shipment, have been very satisfied. When I opened this shipment, all but two cans were severely dented -several cans were dented in multiple places. Even the inside cans were damaged. So this does not appear to be an issue with the case being damaged during shipment.  Had to inspect each can for bulges or small openings, as I was concerned about contamination of the food. A lesser, but still frustrating, issue than risk of contamination is the difficulty I have trying to scrape all of the food out of each can (due to the depth and large number of dents in the cans). It is simply unacceptable that this case was shipped to me in such horrible condition. Looks like its time to start picking up this dog food myself at the local pet supply store. At least then I can be sure that the cans are not damaged.
