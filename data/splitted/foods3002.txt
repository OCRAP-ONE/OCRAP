review/text: I bought this because I heard about the benefits of Sage tea. I got used to the taste pretty quickly and love to pour it in a glass of ice to enjoy during the summer days.<br /><br />I took a star off because I've been drinking it for several weeks and I'm not seeing the work of benefits that is claimed of Sage tea (but then, I've always believed that you lose some benefits when the teas are in bags as opposed to still being in leaf form?).

review/summary: Not as rose-flavored as you might think, but still good
review/text: I bought this tea thinking it would taste like a rose. I was only half right. While the rose flavor is still there, you have to really search for it. I think it takes a few cups to do that because this is primarily a fruity tea. After you knock the first few cups down and find the subtle rose flavor, you'll find that it tastes like what a rose would taste like if it were a fruit. Which is basically what rose hips are. After drinking this entire box, I found that I really liked it. I was sad when the box was gone and I do intend to get some more soon.<br /><br />Just as an added note, I feel this needs to be mentioned. If you're like me and like to suck on the teabag, I do not recommend doing it with this tea! The bags themselves are not very thick and will break and you will have an explosion of mushy rose hips in your mouth!

review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

review/text: I have one cup a day and it really decreases my night sweats. I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/summary: Yogurt Powder - The truth
review/text: Do not buy this!!! I love boba tea drinks. I've spent a small fortune buying them. To save money I realized it would be cheaper to find the ingredients and make it myself so I bought this powder. This is not yogurt powder! This is yogurt creamer, BIG DIFFERENCE! Tastes nothing like the drink I'm use to. The powder itself barely tastes sweet. Imagine buying creamer and adding it to black tea that is what you will get, gross. This creamer is not sweet nor does it taste like yogurt or at least the fake boba yogurt flavor that most Asians are familiar with. If you want to make real yogurt black tea or green tea boba drink then buy the syrup and not the powder. Trust me you will thank me!<br /><br />I think this powder is used for making yogurt milk tea or the yogurt ice blended drink but you have to add the yogurt syrup, sold separately.

review/summary: Shattered expectations
review/text: I thought something was a little odd about this company's marketing strategy.  No savvy business would think to advertise a California wine as a Hawaii wine.  So why did they choose Santorini, a popular tourist destination not known for its olive oil, to advertise an olive oil originating from the most prestigious olive growing region in the world, Messinia, home of the famed Kalamata olive?  Buyer gullibility?  Ignorance?  To drive this point home, Messinia is to olive oil what Bordeaux is to wine.  So this advertising gimmick was a real head scratcher...until I tried it.  Then it all made sense.<br /><br />To be fair, I'm a descendant of this region of Greece, so I had high hopes of procuring a top quality olive oil, especially given the price.  Instead, this olive oil was little different from the lower quality varieties sold by large food companies.  It is very light, an attribute on its own....if that were enough.  But it isn't, and there was a noticeable lack of aroma and flavor typical of olive oils from this region of Greece.  In fact, it was downright funky.  Maybe the large plastic jug it was shipped in was the culprit.  Olive oil from Messinia is traditionally packed in large cans.  So who knows?  All in all, this is not a terrible olive oil; it's just a very average, overpriced one.  There are several better Kalamata olive oils sold in local supermarkets (Iliada, to name one).  Consequently, I wouldn't recommend this oil to those that know the difference.

I consume it raw every day on salads and other dishes that require extra virgin olive oil and the taste is out of this world. This oil is as good if not better than the other much more expensive brands on the market.  It has a super low acidity level and at that price you can't go wrong.

review/text: My kids and I love these granola bars although I will admit that because we are gluten-free, the bar is set pretty low.  That being said, these bars are soft and chewy without being too sticky, there are plenty of mini-dark chocolate chips to appeal to the under-5's, and the almonds, quinoa, chia and flax (protein! omega 3 & 6s!) make me super happy.  As far as uber healthy snack foods go, these are one of our favorites.

review/summary: IF they work, I'll continue with them
review/text: I'm going to have to disagree with the previous review of this product.  They obviously have a large cat??  These treats are actually a bit too big for my Persians and I have to squash them so that the cats can get their teeth into them instead of just rolling them around and losing them.  I would actually rate this product much higher except for several things.  I rate it high because my cats ALL love them (8 cats), I rate it high on ingredients because it's very difficult to find cat treats that aren't just dry food in disguise complete with corn and wheat ingredients, and lastly, I would LOVE to rate these for effectiveness in keeping the teeth clean, but I just don't know if they work worth a darn... it's too early to tell.  The product does not get top rating from me because of the high price for low quantity and for the difficulty my cats have in eating them without my intervention.

review/summary: Cat tested, vet approved!
review/text: Every year at the vet office, we would be told that one of our cats had a problem with dental plaque.  After going through the trouble to have her teeth cleaned, we figured these would be worth a try even though they are expensive.  The cats love them!  The only problem is that they are too big for either cat to eat so I cut them in half.  The treats have an outer casing though, which is important in helping clean the teeth and is unfortunately very fragile and likely to tear.  To slice the treats, I very carefully poke through the casing and the treat all the way around with a knife until it comes apart - a regular slicing motion would tear the casing and reduce the effectiveness of the treat.  This is quite time consuming when I open a new package (I split all 50 treats at once to make dispensing easier later), but we have been plaque-free and the cats are happy!

review/summary: Eucalyptus Oil, really?
review/text: My cats loved these treats.  I loved these because they are cheaper than the CET brand, and neither of my cats had any trouble eating them.  Why the single star then?  Well, because I can no longer give them to my cats in good conscience.  They just recently changed the formula to include eucalyptus oil, which is toxic to cats.  And it's listed not once, but twice.  I have an elderly cat who has chronic renal failure, and there is no way I am giving her anything that is even the tiniest bit toxic.  Maybe if I had 2 young cats I would be less concerned, but as it stands, there is no way I will buy these treats again unless they change the formula back.  I still have the packages from the last order I bought, and there is no eucalyptus oil anywhere in the ingredients.  I have no idea what they were thinking when they added a well known toxin to their formula, but I will be buying the CET treats from now on.

review/summary: Description, Summary, Review -- 6 lb cat, several years of these treats
review/text: I have to admit, I'm not really sure what some of these reviews mean. I have a 16 year old cat.  I have bought these treats on and off over several years of her life, and she loves them. I feel good about the ingredients (primarily dried fish) and the tooth benefit (though I am neither a vet nor a dentist). The only reason I have not bought these for other years has had to do with my proximity to a PetSmart, where I used to buy them. Tonight, I came to Amazon to order some for her upcoming birthday, and I read what I think may be misleading reviews. To help people with their purchases, let me add a little bit here.<br /><br />First, a description. These look, feel and sound a lot like pieces of strofoam packing peanuts, only about 3/4 the size. They are wide in circumference, maybe a half inch or a bit more. They are difficult to get into a mouth of a cat, ie. the reviewer's Persian, true. The way they work is to have the cat work the fishy styrofoam through the teeth several times in order to scrape off plaque and tartar. Although my old girl is only 6 lbs, I also have had a 20 lb calico and an 11 lb Persian. All three cats did well with these treats. They seemed to chew them for a while, and the squeaking sound on their teeth as they ate made me feel like they did their job.<br /><br />Second, cost. These are definitely more expensive than several kinds of cat treats. I would not give them as treats, frankly, but more as a tooth brushing.<br /><br />Third, I cannot verify if they are effective or not empirically. I know that the vet is routinely surprised by my 16-yr. old cat's teeth. 1. She still has them all. 2. They look great with very little tartar. I don't brush her teeth. Maybe it's the treats, the 14 years of dry food, or genetics. Either way, I'll order these for her Bday, and I'll feel good about the purchase.

review/summary: My cats love these
review/text: I can't 100% verify the "dental value" of these treats, but both of my cats do love these. I do not think these treats are too big or too small (I have a 9lb burmese and a 13 lb ragdoll mix) and they eat these up fine. My burmese breaks it up into pieces and then likes eats all of the crumbs. My Ragdoll kind if eats it in one bite (not sure if he even chews it--but I don't worry about him choking on it)...<br /><br />My 5 year old Burmese has been eating these off an on (when I get around to buying these). I also occasionally use pet teeth wipes to clean his teeth. I've recently had his teeth checked out by my Vet a few months ago and she's told me he has relatively clean teeth for a 5 yr old. He is getting his teeth cleaned for the very first time in a few weeks (for preventive care).<br /><br />Of course, all cats have different tastebuds. If you can get a sample or try a bag to see if your cat likes them, it's worth a shot.<br /><br />Even if this doesn't work as a preventative dental care, I'll continue buying this as both of my cats love this treat. Plus, I found out that Amazon is much cheaper than petsmart (which sells for $13-14).

review/summary: small cat chews this well
review/text: I have a small cat(8.9lbs)who we adopted through a shelter. She had very little history other than her approximate age and came to us gulping her food, not chewing. Although she has been a delightful cat for over a year she still does not chew her food so we decided to try something bigger to force her to chew. The dental treats disappear and her tarter is under control. We have found no problems with the size of the bits and in fact I think they are doing a marvelous job.

review/summary: Kittty Crack
review/text: My cat's love this stuff - but more importantly, it works to keep their teeth clean.  Originally I would hand them out as I thought about it - maybe a couple times a week (if they were lucky). Than the vet told me one of my cats was getting a little tarter build up and would need to have his teeth cleaned in about 6 months. That's when I started them on the Petrodex every morning. Seven months later the vet said there is not tarter build up and no need to have his teeth cleaned at this time. Now they get them every morning and depending on how loud they yell whenever I get close to the "treat drawer", potentially twice a day.<br /><br />I started buying Petrodex Cat Dental Treats these over 5 years ago at Pet Smart. Their MSR was about $8.00. The last time I looked for them at PetSmart, probably 3 years ago, they were over 13.00. I've been buying them 6 at a time on line for several years now. I'm glad to see Amazon.com has them on subscribe and save. I'm set up for a 6 pack every 4 months. (2 cats)<br /><br />FYI, I checked the ingredients for eucalyptus oil on my last bag and it's not there. I purchased 6 of them maybe three months ago. Exp date is Oct 2013. I did found it on the ingredient list of the newest packaging posted online. A white bag instead of a red bag.  I don't see the need for the change. Let's see if it's still kitty crack with the added ingredient.

But dispensing the treats when they are really starting to get hungry has just done the trick for Annabelle.  And they get good vet reviews on their teeth and gums.  Unfortunately I have just read another review on Amazon stating that Petrodex now contains eucalyptus oil which is toxic to cats.  I am thinking I will have to switch to the more expensive CET.

review/text: I haven't tasted one myself, but both of our Siberians wait for them showing eager anticipation -- they are gone quickly each morning (just 1 for each cat).  We feed our cats both the Petrodex (mainly because they obviously enjoy them) and the less pricey Temptations Dentabits; our vet remarks at each yearly exam that their teeth are extremely clean and free of tartar.  The pricing of the Petrodex treats has gone over the top, but this supplier had a truly fair price (more than 50% less than most suppliers) and delivered the ordered supply promptly.

But even though they are big my 7 lb girl goes for the whole thing to bite it although 1/2 goes on the floor but she cleans that up.  She is a 2 year old I just got 2 months ago and the vet said her teeth had plague build up so I'm hoping these help, she's not the type to let me brush her teeth, although I have wanted to buy those dental wipes to use along with these.  My girl has a small mouth and she handles these so I think if the cat likes them enough they will bite through to get the benefit.  Ultimately it would be better if they were a little smaller, and I also give her some greenies so I hope it helps.

review/text: Black Jewell brand is my favorite popcorn.  It does pop smaller than major brand popcorn, but it tastes so much better.  Not sure why some reviewers complain about the size of the popped corn. This is my first experience with the crimson, as I usually buy the black kernel, but it tastes just as good.  I recently couldn't find Black Jewell in my local supermarket and I had to buy regualar popcorn.  I hated it. So glad I found it on Amazon! You'll realize what crud you've been eating all your life if you eat this for a while and then have to eat supermarket popcorn again.

review/text: Do not like regular yellow corn; because of tough hull.  Two table spoon of olive oil, and I can eat these pop corns without butter.  Slight nutty flavor is an added bonus.  These pop up to have less volume; but I find them just as filling.

review/summary: Just as tasty as Black Jewell Popcorn - Maybe Better
review/text: My friend recently got me hooked on Black Jewell Popcorn. I make a daily batch in my stovetop Popcorn Kettle which I make with simply Olive Oil and salt. Love the little white kernels and nutty flavor. I bought the Crimson Jewell Popcorn online to give it a try  and I actaully might like it a bit more then the Black Jewell!! Looks the same, tastes the same, but I think the kernels might be oh-so-slightly puffier than the Black Jewell. I now use half Black & half Crimson in each batch and I am tickled pink with my popcorn. This popcorn actually stores well once popped, & I always have a large ziploc bag of popcorn at my desk...wil last all week and taste fine, unlike microwave popcorn that tastes nasty once it cools off. Icky!

review/text: This is the best popcorn I've ever had. It's perfect fir the way in which I make my popcorn; on the stove, in a kettle with either coconut oil or olive oil.<br /><br />It tastes great; it's fluffy and doesn't get caught in my teeth. Besides the great taste, this popcorn is actually healthy for you. It contains antioxidants that you will not find in commercially grown popcorn or microwave popcorn.<br /><br />It really is the best popcorn I've ever had.

review/text: Dubble Bubble is the best tasting sugar free bubble gum made.<br /><br />I am a type 1 diabetic for 34 and Dubble Bubble and have tried numerous brands of sugar free bubble gum but not one comes close to Dubble Bubble.  I first discovered this gum at Wal Mart wiping the shelf clear of all packages.  Approximately a year ago Wal Mart stopped selling it and I tried other sugar free gums but nothing took the place Dubble Bubble.  A friend of mine ordered the gum from Amazon and surprised me with 12 packages.  I have ordered the gum on-line since but I do find it more expensive than Wal Mart by $1.00.  Since I have no options I will continue to order the gum from the Amazon site.

review/text: My little Maltese will do anything just for a broken off piece of a "cookie."  He likes the peanut flavored heart shaped ones.  I must never, ever run out of them.  They seem to be everything they are advertised to be. I can see pieces of carrots and peanuts when I break one in half.  He only gets an entire cookie once a day because he is so small.  They last him quite awhile, but as I said, he's addicted and would be one sad pooch if I didn't have extra bags of them on hand.

review/text: If you're not familiar, these are definitely one of the more elaborate chocolate bars on the market. There's a centre of wafers and "cream" (no idea of what it's actually made of), with lots of peanuts around that, and then milk chocolate coating the whole thing.<br /><br />Hey, at least the peanuts are healthy, I guess... ;-)<br /><br />These are pretty good, and they're also one of the more chewey and filling chocolate bars around. That might be a plus in that it should help stop you from eating too many!<br /><br />One final word of advice: while the range of packages available and pricing does vary over time, do make the effort to check out the different deals available. I have found in general that with the chocolate bars for sale here on amazon, there can be considerable variation in the price per bar you end up paying. So it is worth doing your homework here.<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Does the Job
review/text: I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.<br /><br />I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIER.<br />As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder, it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.<br /><br />OTHER CONCERNS<br />Sometimes you get a bright blue stream and a few seconds later a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer.  After a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue---but it is probably just as rich in fertilizer as long as there is a tablespoon or so of undesolved fertilizer in the container.  The blue pigment is more soluble, but is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.<br /><br />TIPS ON USE:<br />Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.<br /><br />When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it "used up".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.<br /><br />FEEDING SCHEDULE<br />A good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.<br /><br />FOLIAR FEEDING<br />Part of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.<br /><br />DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMS<br />Despite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.

review/summary: Used it for Years
review/text: Some of Scott's products contain ingredients not disclosed on the label.<br /><br />Although I've used this product for a long time I've switched to Jack's Pro Water Soluble Fertilizer 25-5-15.  Not only is it cheaper it comes from a company I have no reason not to trust.<br /><br />Apparently not only does Scott's quality control seem to be lacking they seem to be valuuing profit over honesty and safety.  Right now there is a multi-state lawsuit in the courts over bird seed products which were treated with pesticides known by Scotts to be toxic to birds.  Some of the seed was fed to domestic birds, which it killed.  It is unknown how many wild birds were destroyed.  The evidence is that pesticides were added to the seed to preserve the product during storage, even though staff told management about the toxicity.  Scott's has offered to pay a fine, an amount they came up with, which is a fraction of the profit made from 75 million units which continued to be sold, that is until employees notified the EPA.<br /><br />I've also seen various other complaints about insect egg contamination and ingredient inconsistencies in their bag fertilizers.<br /><br />So I don't know what might be in this stuff.  It seems clear that if there's a problem I won't be hearing about it from Scott's.

review/summary: I Love Sugar Free Candy
review/text: Ever since I began getting headaches from regular candy, I've been searching for high-flavor sugar-free candy. So much of it seems to start out well then bite you back with a nasty aftertaste. I discovered too, that aspartame was also not good for me, so the search began for candy made with Splenda.<br />This package of Crystal Light Chewy Candy contained strawberry, raspberry orange and lemon. They were square like Starburst, but not quite as intense or as tart, which was a little bit of a let down. The berry flavors were tasty, as was the orange. My favorite flavor was the lemon.<br />I've been a fan of Sorbee hard candies because they have a great taste and texture and no bitter aftertaste, or any kind of head pain. I was thrilled to find chewy candy!<br /><br />If you aren't used to eating sorbitol based candy, however, they are slightly laxative, so you should try to limit yourself to no more than six. The more often you enjoy this type of confection, the less if seems to have that effect. I live with a diabetic who enjoyed the texture and taste of the chews as much as I did, and no spike in sugar numbers was definitely a plus. I would like to see a blend of tropical flavors.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone trying to watch calorie intake, sugar levels and it also has an exchange for those on Weight Watchers. I loved them and will be getting more soon!

review/summary: Really fresh, but water plus no bone or skin makes more like tuna.
review/text: So, these were sort of bland, but I sure can't complain about the quality.  If you want your sardines firm and fresh without all the oil and without the scales and the bones, this is a great choice.  I'll bet if they were mashed up and mixed with mayo and relish and served to me, I'd think I was eating tuna!

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: These are the best canned sardines I've ever bought. They have a good flavor and are so non-fishy and non-oily it's almost like canned chicken. Versatile and healthful.

review/summary: These are my favorite snack bars!
review/text: Mrs. May's Trio bars are my favorite snack/energy bars.  I love them.  They come in four flavors.  Blueberry is my favorite of those flavors; the blueberry ones seem a little sweeter but the sugars content is the same so it may just be because I like the blueberry flavor.<br /><br />The name comes from the ingredients.  The bars have a trio of trios:  3 nuts, 3 seeds and 3 fruits.  The nuts, seeds and 2 of the fruits are the same in all the flavors.  The nuts are cashews, almonds & pistachios.  The seeds are sesame, pumpkin, & sunflower.  The two fruits that are in all the flavors are dates and raisins, but you don't really see or taste them so I wonder if they are cooked down into the "glue" that holds all the other ingredients together.  Dried blueberries are the third fruit in the blueberry flavor.  The only other ingredients are rice malt, natural flavors, cane juice and sea salt.<br /><br />These are great bars for anyone who has issues with wheat or dairy.  The label says they are wheat free, gluten free, dairy free and kosher.  They also have no preservatives.  If you have peanut allergies, the label says they are packaged in a peanut free facility that processes other nuts.<br /><br />Because of the nuts, they have 12 grams of fat per bar, but I've been reading articles that say nuts are a great snack and the fat in nuts is "good" fat.  The label says there is 1.5 grams of saturated fat which surprised me but I guess some of the fat in nuts must be saturated.  To round out the rest of the nutrition facts: calories, 170; total carbs, 15g; dietary fiber, 2g; sugars, 6g; protein, 5g; cholesterol, 0g; trans fat, 0g; and sodium, 45mg.<br /><br />I love the nuts and seeds and the bars don't have the mealy texture that  a lot of energy/snack bars have.  They are low sodium but high in taste and they are really satisfying.  I used to get granola bars but these are so much better.

review/summary: WAY overpriced - Deceptive Description
review/text: I love all natural or organic products that are good for you.  This Mrs. Mays Trio Blueberry product seemed to be such a product.  The taste is good.  I like the combination of berries, seeds, and nuts.  But when I received the product, the image shown on the webpage description is not the same as the product I received.<br /><br />The actual product is VERY small -- only 1.2 ounces.  About twice the size of a 5-stick pack of gum.  Certainly NOT worth about a dollar each!  In fact, it is not worth even 50 cents each, in my opinion.  The image on the website shows a 1.7 ounce bar.  What I received was 1.2 ounce bars.  That's about 30 PERCENT smaller than the advertised product.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was not happy at all.  I was deceived.  I do not believe a 1.2 ounce bar of nuts is worth close to $1 in cost.  Although I like the taste and nutrition, I would not consider purchasing this item again unless the cost falls to around $5 for a 12-pack or $10 for a 24 pack. That's about the most I can justify paying for what you get.  Right now, the price at amazon.com is $23.57 for a 24 pack -- or about $1 per small 1.2 ounce bar.  Outrageous.
