review/text: The packaging isn't the same as in the picture, I've been buying these boxes from Sam's Club for years and have never seen the package that this came in.<br />The gum is also stale, it is very hard to chew. I don't think it's worth the savings in the end.

review/text: Got a great deal on this so I ordered a ton.  Love the taste and the quick freshening of breath, but disappointed that the flavor is gone so quickly.  I have also noticed that after chewing two pieces a day for a couple of weeks my tooth enamel feels weakened...more sensitivity than normal.  I'm giving 3 stars because of value and the great initial taste, but probably wouldn't be ordering this again at any price.

review/text: This gum has Maltitol in it which can cause gastric distress to people sensitive to this ingredient.  It also has Mannitol and Sorbitol, these are all within the first 4 ingredients of the gum!  Be careful if you are sensitive to these sweetener replacements.  Just chewing 2 pieces gave me an upset stomach within an hour of chewing.  My mistake, I should have paid better attention to the list of ingredients on package.

review/text: I have been purchasing Trident White sugarless gum for some time, and I'm quite satisfied with it.  I do prefer the Wintergreen over the Peppermint flavor because it is a little milder, but only the Peppermint was offered when I made this purchase.  It does clean well after eating when you can't brush, and I believe it does whiten some.  I never chew gum with sugar, so this is another plus from Trident.  I will continue to buy it.

review/text: Don't know what it is, but the tell-tale crunch you get when you bite down on one of these little pieces of gum is annoying.  It's like Chicklets, but worse.  The gum does taste good after the preliminary crunching ends (10-15 seconds).  The pieces are small, and last a good 2-3 hours.  They do work well when you don't have time to brush after a meal or coffee (at work, school, etc).

review/summary: Excellent quality chocolate bar
review/text: I have two great food loves, chocolate and tea. This is my favorite regular chocolate bar and I always keep a few in the cabinet. The flavor is intense and satisfying enough that it's easy to eat 1-3 squares and put it away. The cocoa content is high and fair-traded so considering the high antioxidant properties of pure cocoa (four times that of wild blueberries per 100 grams, USDA), it's nearly a guilt-free treat. (Add that to the recent research findings that cocoa is more effective for treating colds than echinacea, and I'm pretty sure I can justify eating 1-3 squares a day, which is 28-80 calories.) The rhino chocolate bar is the perfect blend of bitter and sweet, of dry and creamy. I highly recommend it, however, I understand that like wine, chocolate is a matter of personal taste.

Everybody seems to like muffins and these packets are just right to make for two people for a couple of days breakfast or to make several packets of different flavors to have a mixture of different muffins to have for a larger group of people.<br /><br />With this mix you just add � cup of milk and bake and in 14 to 17 minutes you have a fast and delicious muffin to enjoy.  Each pouch makes 6 servings and they are really good.  Eat them warm with a little melted butter and you will get a smile on your face.<br /><br />I have included a photo of the nutrition data for your review.  Making these muffins is fast and easy and it will make your breakfast something special to start the day with.  We love this product!<br /><br />Just a note, the product is very good but the price here is high in comparison to other sources.  When combined with the shipping costs it is less expensive at other outlets.

review/text: Just bought a bag of the plain variety at Whole Foods for $7. As a diabetic with limited snack choices (no meds), these healthy crackers have great flavor and are fairly low in net carbs - 4g of carbs for 5 crackers (1 serving). Great snack in moderation for diabetics succeeding on diet alone or in combo with meds. Just be conscious when you are eating. Set yourself a limit, say 5 or 7, whatever you can accept. At 5 crackers per sitting, the bag will last you 9 sittings. Digging into the bag, hand to mouth, while your attention is somewhere else, phone or tv, and these bags will start costing a lot of money over the long haul.

review/text: This soup is DELICIOUS!  I have tried "bagged/boxed" soups and they usually aren't very good.<br />Plus they usually have maltodextrin and yeast or other things in them I want to avoid.<br />This soup is VERY simple, tasty and healthy. The ingredients are:dehydrated black beans, corn, red and green peppers, onions, garlic, epazote, and chili spices.  It seems that they got the balance of spices and veggies just right.  I find that difficult to do on my own.  Also since it packaged up nicely you don't have to go "scavenging" in your spice cabinet for all the spices.  I use my own chicken broth I make after roasting a chicken and it's a very healthy meal. (There is no added salt so if you are restricting salt you decide how much to add and what type of salsa you use.)So hurry up Amazon and get this in! :0)

But it took a lot of time to shop for and cook with all those ingredients and the cost was much higher.<br /><br />This soup tastes great and all you need to have is 6 cups of broth, pre-cooked chicken breast and some tortilla chips to throw on top. (FYI- I'm glad it's not hot/spicy. Throw in chili powder if you're into that.) These are really healthy, tasty ingredients. I ran into this in a nice local market and it was $7 or $8! I figured it was worth a try because making it on my own takes so long. I'm really glad I checked Amazon and can get two soups for that price.<br /><br />I need to try other flavors now...

review/text: This soup I tried at a fair and have been addicted ever since.  I like that you have the flexability to chose the spiciness with the salsa that you add.  We have made some additions where we add avacados and queso fresco.  I saw that amazon now carries it and I can get it cheaper than from the actual company big win.

review/text: I'm a tortilla soup nut anyway but have never attempted it on my own.  I just search it out on menus at Mexican restaurants.  This soup mix is not only quick and easy but it is downright delicious!  It rivals the soup I find at the Mexican restaurants for twice the price.  If you're on the fence, try it - you will not be disappointed and as another reviewer said, it makes a great gift.  I wish someone had gifted it to me years ago!  Serving suggestion: alongside a frozen Margarita.  Cheers!

review/text: Finding anything that is gluten free that the whole family can enjoy is reason enough to rejoice.  Soups have been a let down in the past because usually you want something just as quick as it is tasty.  This soup fit the bill perfectly for quick and delicious AND gluten free!  SO tasty my husband and I both had seconds and quick enough to make a difference to the usual lengthy cooking time for us back to basics gals.  I will definitely be reordering and have put out the good word to all my gluten free soul sisters.<br />You won't be disappointed..

It's not easy to find no salt added mixes & the Frontier line is one of the best. I also used no salt tomatoes & put crumbled whole grain baked Tostitos tortilla chips in the bowl. Topped with a little shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Delicious & healthy.

review/text: Great soup!!!  I put in the recommended amount of chicken broth but eliminated the cup of water because I don't like my soup to be watery.  I sprinkled some shredded Mexican style cheese on top and then put the tortilla chips on top of the cheese (the directions tell you to put the tortillas in the bottom of the bowl, but this would cause the chips to be too soggy).  I garnished the soup with chopped tomato and green onions.  It was delicious!!!

review/summary: delicious, nutritious, and no mess! LOVE them.
review/text: We absolutely love these. My son (11 months) would never eat processed baby food.  I tried many different kinds--organic, fruit, vegetables, different brands, jarred, non-jarred, meats, etc.  I gave up and started just giving him "real" food diced up in teeny tiny pieces.  A friend of mine had these and said her baby and toddler both loved them so I decided to give them a try. I ordered using the Subscribe and Save option to save money, assuming and hoping my kids would love them and they do! My son smiles when he sees me grab one from our pantry and immediately opens his mouth like a bird. Makes me laugh.  My 3 year old likes them too, especially if they're cold. She can just grab one from the fridge and suck on them after playing outside for a refreshing and healthy snack.  The S&S option makes them much more affordable, and the free shipping is an added bonus.  There is a wide range of flavors to choose from, and we'll be trying them all.

I always keep some in my purse and in the car when we're out and about.  They are not messy, unless of course they decide to squeeze the pouch, which only happens for us when she's not hungry.<br /><br />The Plum Organics line also includes some varieties with fruits and vegetables mixed together.  They taste surprisingly good and are one way to get my picky eater to eat some veggies.  You can find some varieties at reasonable prices on Amazon, others are more expensive for some reason.  Babies R Us has had a sale every other month or so where you can get them for $1 each if you buy them in sets of 8.  That is usually when I stock up for the next two months. :)

review/summary: a good start to your day-even when you don't have much time...
review/text: This is one of my favorite in the Erin Baker line of Breakfast cookies, the cookie has an oatmeal base but is not a "heavy" cookie. It is nice and moist and has little pieces of caramel in the cookie. I like the fact that the cookie packs a lot in a little package- 280 calories for this cookie, no transfat, 20% of your daily fiber, no cholesterol and chock full of healthy ingredients to get you started (it does however have 23 gr. of sugar, so if you are looking for low sugar, this probably isn't for you). I have to say I was skeptical that this would carry me to lunch because it is just one large cookie, and not like one of those overly heavy, hockey puck like items you expect when you see something is full of fiber, it also didn't have that saw dust kind of texture you get from some power bars. This definitely has enough of the right stuff to keep me full for several hours. My favorite way to eat these cookies are to stick them in the microwave for 20-25 seconds so they get soft and the caramel melts just a little.<br /><br />I pretty much like all of the flavors, but overall this one is probably my most favorite. The other nice thing is that these cookies are meant to freeze and can freeze up to a year. The box of twelve cookies are all individually wrapped and I take them straight from freezer to microwave, for a quick, nutritious breakfast that is both satisfying and delicious.<br /><br />I'm happy to see that amazon seems to be carrying more of the Baker line, which also saves tremendously on the shipping costs!

She lives in MO, I live in TX so I can't run over to take her breakfast.  I have ordered Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies and had them sent to her a couple of times.  She has enjoyed all of them.  I have to eat gluten free so I have not personally tasted them but she says all of the flavors I have sent were very good.  They make a great "gift" for her - once you are that age, there is very little that you need as a gift for an occasion, birthday, Mother's Day, Christmas, etc. - I have found that giving her something edible makes way more sense than giving her something that will just clutter up her house.

review/summary: Gooey Caramel!
review/text: My husband and I have tried to change our eating habits this year and part of that has been making sure we have something for breakfast.  I don't know about everyone else, but we are not friends with our alarm clock.  We have a slap fight every morning with it until we realize we must obey if we want to keep our jobs.  Needless to say, there is no time for breakfast before we rush out the door.<br /><br />This is where these cookies come in very handy.  The first time we bought them we kept them in our pantry (I think we bought 60 that time to try a variety of flavors).  Unfortunately, by the time we reached the last dozen, they had gone bad and were a bit fuzzy.  Now this is actually a good thing!  Mold can't grow without moisture, so this tells you the cookies are moist!  Because they are all natural and are not made with preservatives, it is only reasonable that they would have a shorter shelf life.<br /><br />Next order we popped a weeks worth in the fridge and put the rest in the freezer.  We did this because my husband likes to eat them in morning traffic on his way to work so frozen cookies wouldn't work for him.  I on the other hand work in a very small office so I brought a variety to work and put them in our freezer.  In the morning I just pop one into the microwave for 45 seconds and I have a warm, tasty breakfast.  I especially like the gooeyness of the melted caramel and chocolate from those varieties.<br /><br />At an average of 300 calories it is a good meal alternative and is very filling.  It is a nice alternative to drinking a slim fast for breakfast, though I do sometimes still do Slimfast for breakfast and have a cookie for lunch.<br /><br />I would like to see them come in a variety dozen.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Good Breakfast Cookies-- and BTW, corn syrup is not HFCS!
review/text: My wife and I have tried just about all the flavors of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies.  They're all good -- moist, filling, and they keep well in the freezer as well as in tins.  They're easy to warm in the microwave, too; about 30 seconds if frozen, about 12-15 seconds otherwise. Just clip off the end of the individual package and zap. (Those who complain about about dryness may have put one in a toaster for too long.)  As to the ingredients, I looked at the list on the back of the 'Caramel Apple' version to see the dreaded "corn syrup" someone complained about. First, it's NOT HFCS. Second, it's in the caramel!  Most of the cookies don't have any.<br /><br />The only reason we don't give this cookie 5 stars is that they are very, very sweet for our tastes.  The sweetness may even prevent some from being able to detect all the other flavors.  Dried apples and unsweetened apple sauce are good ingredients, prune puree isn't bad either, the apple pie-type spices are very nice, and a little molassas is traditional.  It's the evaporated cane juice and brown rice syrup in the cookie and the liquid sugar and corn syrup in the caramel bits that may take the sweetness over the top for some.  The way we see it, this is a highly portable breakfast for when you're in a hurry, and it may be low fat/high fiber, but don't kid yourself -- it's a cookie.  We'd recommend drinking something like V-8 as well as something hot like tea with milk or a skinny latte to round out this quickie cookie breakfast. (Just watch your sweet intake for the rest of the day ....)

review/text: Bought these so I could eat them for breakfast when I'm really short on time or to eat during break time from work and wow, they are so good!!  Also brought a couple of them over to a trip to Europe and they were perfect!  I never got tired of these at all!  I haven't tried the other ones but this Caramel Apple breakfast cookie is so delicious!  The ingredients that are in here are the real thing: whole grain oats, dried apples, caramel bits and apple pie spice, to name a few.  No high-fructose corn syrup, trans-fats or artificial anything will you find in these, which is even more awesome.  Nice that they're individually wrapped and just the right size!  Since there's no preservatives, you may want to freeze them so they'll last longer - just heat them up in the microwave and they'll taste great!  I do not regret buying these at all - very happy to have bought these!!

review/text: This is one of my favorite Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies. I freeze them as soon as they arrive and microwave one each morning for 20 seconds. Seconds that don't come fast enough when you want one. Toasting then in the toaster on the Darkest setting is pretty good too. These make me WANT to eat breakfast every day even though it's not IHOP or a fancy breakfast!

review/summary: Great substitute for a bowl of oatmeal, just don't let the word "cookie" fool you
review/text: Judged as COOKIE cookies, Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies would be heavy and dense. But they're not. They're an alternative to a bowl of oatmeal (and MUCH better than the almost-as-expensive Quaker Oats Breakfast Cookies, which to us are practically inedible). According to my wife, they're indispensable for anyone with hectic mornings who CANNOT skip breakfast. She says they last her about as well as a standard size bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Based on reviews, we tried the Caramel Apple ones first. Heating benefits these more than the other varieties because it melts their little caramel "bombs". I don't like nuts, so I didn't try the Fruit & Nut ones. My wife says they're good too, but more along the lines of traditional hippie fare. They have a higher fat content than some flavors, as do the Double Chocolate Cherry. She would love to see these sour cherries make a solo appearance, without chocolate as a partner. The Gingerbread flavor is quite gingery, enough to overcome the inevitable molasses (which she doesn't care for). These last two flavors, along with Pumpkin Spice, are seasonal. She says of the three, she gives the Pumpkin Spice a very slight edge over the other two. When it comes to the sweet spices, we like them strong, and the Pumpkin has plenty cinnamon.<br /><br />Interestingly, the primary sweetener in all of these cookies is prune puree. My wife, who is not especially fond of prunes, doesn't notice it. Ditto for the chicory extract, which is also in all varieties.<br /><br />One important note: the instructions say to freeze the cookies right away, and that's what we do. If they could all be eaten within a few days, this might not be necessary, but since they last us awhile and are preservative-free, we want them in tip top shape. All we have to do is snip open the wrapper and pop them in the microwave for fifteen seconds. They're labelled "toaster friendly" but we haven't tried that. During wintertime, placing them on the dashboard with the defroster on high might even do the trick.

review/summary: Keep in the Freezer
review/text: I was hoping for a quick and delicious, easy to grab-n-go breakfast. These were definitely quick and easy, just not exactly delicious. When I kept them at room temperature, they tasted a little card-boardish. Microwaving didn't help. The packing recommended that they be kept frozen, so I did, and I actually liked them better from the freezer. They didn't need defrosting, they weren't rock hard, and I think the flavor improved.<br /><br />I probably won't try this flavor again, but I am willing to try one of the other Erin Baker Breakfast Cookie flavors to see if I like one of them better.

review/summary: I LOVE THEM ALL! PARTICULARLY THIS ONE.
review/text: I am so addicted to these cookies! Love them! They are great for a meal substitute or snack .  Not too sweet-just right. They are good for you too.  What else could you want?  No more dessert store bought cookies for us. We have disabilities in our home so 'easy' is a word we love. At first we tried the Morning Glory Cookies and loved those so ordered 4 more different kinds, caramel apple, banana nut, peanut butter with chocolate, fruit and nut . We all loved them all.  The Caramel Apple went first though. My son's favorites are caramel apple, peanut butter with chocolate and banana nut. Frozen we heat in microwave 25 seconds.  I love the gooey flavor and texture of the caramel apple.  I want one right now but unfortunately we are out Darn it! Do not hesitate to try these in any flavor.  They are a bargain.  We are getting the automatic monthly shipping next month  which is even more of a bargain and will order probably 10 packages at least, for 3 people. I told you we love them!

review/summary: Caramel Apple Delicious
review/text: Delicious is a word that perfectly describes this cookie. I absolutely love Erin Baker's Caramel Apple Breakfast Cookie.<br /><br />I do not just eat this cookie for breakfast, but for an all the time snack. When I am hungry and I want a quick pick me up, I grab one. I for one, throw it into the microwave for 15 seconds so that I get that hot "just baked" taste.<br /><br />Amazon Prime makes everything so easy that I recommend it to my family and friends. I cannot think of a better way to have snacks stocked than by using Amazon Prime to deliver. In doing so, you do not have to worry about lines, traffic, and finding out if what you are looking for is still stocked on the store shelves.<br /><br />To the people out there who are looking for something that is great to eat in the morning or anytime, you cannot go wrong with Erin Baker's Caramel Apple Breakfast Cookie.

review/text: I put one of these cookies in my lunchbox as I leave my house for work. I am gone from home an average of 14.5 hours a day and I have a 1 hour comute each direction. I usually eat this cookie as soon as I leave work and by the time I get home I can just change and go for a run and I dont have to worry about how much I have eaten. This is a great way for me to get some good nutrition before a run. I love this product.

review/summary: Erin Baker Breakfast Cookies
review/text: So far, I have tried caramel apple, fruit & nut, morning glory, and banana walnut flavers. I have also ordered, (but not yet received) the pumpkin spice cookies. All of them are an excellent meal replacement or nutritious snack. The ingredients are wholesome, there is no high fructose corn syrup, and they have a good supply of protein & fiber to stave off hunger for several hours. The caramel apple is probably my favorite because it seems to be the moistest, but I really love all of the flavors. Like other reviewers, I freeze them, and then microwave a cookie for 20 seconds when I am ready to eat it. I find the cookies taste best warmed up. Even though the calorie count is higher than many cookies, I think you get a lot of nutritional "value" with these.

review/text: Gooey to the point of being appalling.<br /> I fail to understand how or why anyone could justify paying over a dollar a piece for these things. Sure, the instructions are dead-on with the freeze-before-toasting method, but they have more ingredients than healthy cookies I can make at home for MUCH cheaper, and with superior texture and without the garbage. If you think these are healthy OR a good value, you've been duped.

review/summary: Surprisingly filling and larger than expected!
review/text: I realize that the product description said 3 oz.  however, in my mind these were going to be smaller cookies than they are.  Big, thick and wonderful.  When the instructions state that the cookies hold up to the toaster, they are serious and when toasted (I was a skeptic and stood hovering about the toaster expecting **flames**, which sadly, there were none of) this cookie became even better.<br /><br />It is possible to eat this cookie quickly (I observed my son do so), however, it took me 10 min or so to finish mine while enjoying my cuppa coffee.  Wonderful breakfast alternate!

review/summary: A nice alternative to other breakfast bars
review/text: After eating cereal and breakfast bars for so long, I wanted to try something different so I ordered this. Of course, I questioned the idea of a breakfast cookie however, I was pleasantly surprised. The cookie is soft and tastes like apple. The texture is kind of like a oatmeal cookie. Only downside is that I can't find the expiration date on these cookies so I had to stick some in the freezer like it said, which didn't really change the taste.

The cookie is a good size, and it kept me full until lunch.<br /><br />I also like my bar to be healthy, and this one fits the bill.  I only wish it was organic.<br /><br />As for the taste - it was slightly above average.  I have had better, but I have also had MUCH WORSE!  There were big chunks of apples inside, and I tried one toasted like the wrapper suggested and it was even better!

review/text: I had read about these cookies, not sure where, but decided to try them as I'm always way too busy for a good breakfast though I try and eat oatmeal at home when I can.  I ordered both the Caramel Apple (love anything with caramel) and the Pumpkin Spice as both of these had the best reviews.  I was pleased with both flavors, though of course, partial to the Carmel Apple.  While not a true "cookie" taste/texture, which was mentioned by Erin Baker in the article I read, it fit the bill for a healthy breakfast on the go.  Will definitely order again.
