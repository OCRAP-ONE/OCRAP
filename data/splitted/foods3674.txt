review/summary: Pretty Disappointed
review/text: I like others tried this coffee on the basis of Consumer Reports recommendation so I was very disappointed with how poor I found this coffee to be. I tried these beans in a drip coffee maker and French press. It lacks any kind of body and I found I have had to use 50% more beans per brew to get any decent level of body and taste, so any hope that this would be great-tasting reasonably-priced coffee was also not to be. I bought 4 packs and am half-way through the last bag and can't wait to be done with this bland, bland, bland coffee. (I'm obviously too cheap just to dump it)!<br /><br />I also gave these beans a test in my espresso machine; forget about it! You will get zip in the way of "crema" from these beans (not that they are intended for espresso). An interesting thing I noticed when brewing the beans in my espresso maker was that the coffee stream went to very waterey very fast giving visual evidence to my taste experience of blandness.<br /><br />So in a word, would I recommend these beans? An unequivocal "NO".

review/summary: Good coffee good price
review/text: Based on our own comparisons and consumer reports, we've been drinking 8 o'clock coffee for several years now (whole bean, original or colombian) and I'm always looking for a good price.  The best I usually do at the store is around $4.75 a bag, and sometimes I have a coupon that gets it down to $4.25.  Buying it thru amazon under a subscription is slightly cheaper and I don't pay sales tax.  This is the only item so far that has made sense for us to do a subscription, but it works great-- I can change the delivery date anytime, increase, decrease, etc.  I highly recommend this coffee for everyday morning joe, and also the subscription service.

review/text: Eight O'Clock Original is a good medium roast coffee, which is probably why some reviewers gave a low rating.  Most low ratings mentioned Starbucks or Peets as favorites; I haven't tried Peets, but Starbucks is roasted too dark for me.  If you like Starbucks, you might like Eight O'Clock French Roast better.

review/summary: Does not meet the hype
review/text: We bought this coffee spurred by the hype brought on by the Consumer report rating of it as being the best coffee out there.  The fact that it was also much cheaper that the Peets or Starbucks whole coffee we ususally buy was also very attractive.  We were however very disappointed.  This coffee was neither as tasty nor as strong as either Peets or Starbucks coffee.  Even the Costco brand coffee is more flavorful and stronger than this coffee.  My wife is a hardcore coffee drinker armed with a french press, and I am a recreational drinker (the type to ad either cacao, sweetener or cream, or all) yet we both agreed that we'd rather spend the $3 or $4 more a bag and get either Peets or Starbucks.

review/summary: Overrated
review/text: When I saw this coffee rate top with Consumer Reports, over Dunkin' Doughnuts and other boutique coffees, I thought I would give it a try. I like exotic starbucks and peets coffees but I am not too snooty to enjoy a can of columbian coffee from the grocery store. Dunkin Doughtnuts coffee, for example is very good.<br /><br />Eight 0'Clock sucks grinds. It is a very dull, boring coffee with little to recommend it. I guess I could say that there is no off flavor like in some of the canned coffees.<br /><br />Other than that, not much to say. If you are indifferent to flavor and just like the ritual of grinding and drinking hot black liquid, this might be your brand.

Because there's so much that unless you're feeding a crew of Vikings it'll last a very long time.<br /><br />It's not as good as real fresh pasta but it's a much better deal and it lasts a whole lot longer.

review/summary: Almost unbearable to drink.
review/text: I recently purchased one can at a grocery store to try. It has a nice, light fruit taste in the beginning, but then there is a horrible aftertaste that is hard to get pass. I am guessing this aftertaste is caused by the green coffee extract, which I have never had any beverage with green coffee in it before. So if you like the taste of green coffee, then you should be fine with this beverage. If not, the taste becomes somewhat more bearable as you drink it. To me, the fruit taste is almost barely discernable as strawberry and I could not detect any lemonade taste. The taste is similar to no calorie or sugarless "sparkling fruit water" which, to me, tastes fine.

review/summary: Good flavor, gets slimy in milk
review/text: We bought this cereal for my daughter who happens to love anything Dora related. After one bowl she wasn't interested in eating another. She said she liked it but never wanted to eat it. Instead she asked for our shredded wheat (first red flag) for breakfast.<br />After a couple of days of this I flat out asked her, "Honey, does it taste bad?"<br />She said, "I like Dora but I just dont think she makes good cereal. Is Dora going to be mad at me?"<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Kids can be so adorable you wanna eat them up, right? So I told her Dora was fine blah blah, loves you anyway blah blah. All is well with the world. Afterward I tried a bowl myself because I despise wasting anything. I can tell you firsthand that the flavor is good, kinda like cinnamon Kix but star shaped (which can poke your mouth somewhat). It doesn't taste super sweet either, which is advertised on the box so that's truth in advertising. The main issue I had was that as soon as the cereal hits the milk it turns...SLIMY - but only on the outside. The inside stays crunchy. Together it makes a gross feeling cereal out of what could have been a pleasant experience.<br /><br />So, recap. Great taste, but slimy in milk. If you don't mind slimy stuff in your mouth then this is the cereal for you. If you don't like that kinda thing, stick with cinnamon Kix.

review/summary: My FAVORITE Low-Carb Cereal
review/text: Hi-Lo Maple Pecan Low Carb Cereal is THE BEST low-carb cereal I have found in 8 years of living a low-carb lifestyle.  If it didn't say "Low-Carb" on the box, you would never know it was a low-carb cereal; the flavor is better than many of the usual grocery store cereals that are loaded with carbs and sugar.<br /><br />Although I have tried the other flavors of Hi-Lo Low Carb cereals, this flavor is my personal favorite (the others are also very good, but I am a sucker for maple - the maple flavor in this cereal is excellent).  The cereal contains both flakes and puffed crunchy pieces similar to Rice Krispies as well as chunks of pecans.<br /><br />I enjoy this cereal with Hood's Calorie Countdown 2% Dairy Beverage (used to be called Hood's Carb Countdown), or with heavy cream if the Hood's is unavailable.  I also enjoy it dry as a healthy between-meal snack.<br /><br />I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product for anyone living a low-carb lifestyle.

review/summary: It's okay to have cereal again!
review/text: Sweetened with sucralose, this is a terrific cereal for low-carb enthusiasts.  Actually, Hi-Lo Pecan Low Carb cereal is a little too sweet for my taste (though that won't bother those of you with a sweet tooth), though the unsweetened pecans even things out a little.  In the end,  it's great to be able to have a decent serving of cereal here and there with minimal impact to my daily carb intake.  Two or three bowls of Hi-Lo during the course of the week has had zero negative impact on my Atkins weight control program; in fact, I may have to eat a few more bowls each week, as I've reached my weight goal and don't really need to lose anymore!  Enjoy this cereal- with some naturally low carb half and half- and you'll see the benefits of Atkins without craving an old standby like cereal in your diet.

review/text: I love this cereal!! I just don't feel right if I can't start my day off with cereal. Being on Adkins makes that impossible. Hi-Lo makes that POSSIBLE!! I gave some to my friends children in a cup when they came to visit and they kept asking for more. It's great stuff!! My fav so far is the vanilla almond. They're all great!

review/summary: Taste like cardboard
review/text: I'm buying lots of stuff from Amazon.  When it is cheap I don't complain, just toss the stuff in the trash.<br /><br />This Hi Lo cereal tasted like cardboard.  I have not complained to the supplier, not Amazon.  I hate to bother with refunds.<br /><br />I'm on a low calorie diet, tested the cereal dry out of the box that arrived, then served to myself with milk as advised.  I could eat it, but I threw both boxes I had just received -- out.<br /><br />Terrible taste. Maybe the calories are low but the taste is worse.<br /><br />Karl

review/summary: Expensive and overly artificially sweet
review/text: I found this low carb dry cereal cloyingly sweet and extremely expensive for the amount in the package.  I wouldn't buy it again, and would prefer to keep the breakfast glycemic load low with a whole grain hot cereal such as steel cut oatmeal.  To use up the package I have, I add a bit as a crushed topping on a diabetic friendly pudding or fruit dessert.

review/summary: Average taste, nice container, nice as an occasional novelty treat
review/text: These little packets are a nice idea.  For those who have had freeze-dried ice cream in the past, the flavor is pretty similar although I found these tasted a bit more chemical-y than I remembered other kinds tasting.  Overall though it was good enough that I would buy it again flavor-wise.  I did like the size of the packets and the drops, it was nice for snacking, it was resealable so you could have just a taste without wasting, the plastic containers protected it from being crushed, plus a bit neater since the larger blocks tend to crumble, these were easy to pop in your mouth a few or a lot at a time.  There was some breakage/crushing which appeared to be due to rough handling, the stuff was packaged decently--could have been padded better but that may not have helped much given how fragile it is. If not, this is a fun and different thing to have once in awhile and would work well as party favors for children's parties.

review/summary: better, but not the best
review/text: I like the Senseo system; very fast, very hot. But the coffee pods are air and water permeable - of course - and they're packed loosely in a foil and plastic package that isn't air sealed. The coffee would taste fresher if after making the pods, they vacuum-packed them in an air tight pouch. This is great for a quick cup, but for the perfect cup, you need to buy fresh beans and grind them yourself.

review/summary: Thank goodness for SF creamer I can hide at work.
review/text: If all of our creamers or coffee flavorings were rated by their good-for-you factor, we would probably have to stop drinking simple coffee to begin with. (I've also used the sf vanilla syrup, which doesn't have the same creamer effect; to achieve that you'd have to add another dairy product, which defeats the purpose for some specifically restricted diets like mine.) (I don't have to worry about fat content, though.)<br /><br />On my planet, I'm just really happy to have found a sugar-free alternative to the coffee creamer I thought I'd have to give up forever. The powdered form guarantees that I can take this to work without having it stolen from the community refrigerator (and for the fat-conscious people who don't want to give up their creamer, there is a lowfat/fat free version out there). The sugar free version doesn't stray too far from the original vanilla Coffeemate. The only complaint I have is that Amazon doesn't carry the SF liquid vanilla version that I can keep at home.<br /><br />Coffee in and of itself can be a guilty pleasure (caffeine, added sugar, dental stains...); I would recommend this product to anyone who wants the effects of a regular powdered creamer who has very strict natural sugar limits.

The first item on the list (which means that it is the highest mass ingredient) is partially hydrogenated oils.  If you have any problems with cholesterol, I suggest talking to your doctor.....  Or maybe you might want to be like many Americans and just increase your Lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers.  Godspeed.

review/text: Excellent powder creamer. Tastes great and cuts calories and carbs.<br /><br />The review that said the lower calorie and carb counts only came from smaller portions is innaccurate. It is true that portions are smaller, but that is because the flavor is mroe intense, so you add less for the same effect. not to mention, if you add the same amount, the calories don't change and the carbs are cut in half. If you stay with suggested portions this creamer cuts calories in half and brings carbs from 9 per serving to 2 per serving.

review/summary: The kids LOVE them (and so does Mom!)
review/text: In the spirit of helping my children learn that healthier eating DOES NOT necessarily mean no more treats, we got a couple of these on a Buy 1, Get 1 deal at a local store. We packed them for lunches on a few different days as a treat, and they have been requested ever since. They taste delicious, according to the kids.<br /><br />As for Mom, I like them because they are much more healthy than the standard high-fructose corn syrup laden "fruit" treats that are typically marketed for kids. We tried the Clif Z-bars first (rave reviews) and then moved on to these. It says a lot to me that these children's treats were among the first to comply with California's more strict school-lunch laws. I have no problem keeping these stocked in the pantry for an occasional treat, and the kids have no problem eating them!

That is some rarified fruity madness.<br />I don't have kids, but if I did I'd sneak these into their backpacks every morning; instead, I keep these in the car and in my purse, for when I get so busy I forget to eat. It happens. I'm blonde. My husband snacks on them before *and* after meals; I can be convinced of their desert-worthiness with a hunk of high grade chocolate sharing their plate.<br />These snacks are a good source of potassium (great for writer's cramp or lost-weekend-recovery), with almost no sodium and very little sugar.  At 70 calories each, they're just the thing when you're too hungry to decide what you want to eat for dinner. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This is an amazing tasting product. It is real fruit, no artificial ingredients. It has a great texture. The size is prefect for a purse, pocket, brief case, or lunch box. It only has 70 calories, which is equivalent to two organic fruit strips. It is the perfect size for a snack in between meals or for a nice energy boost. The only caution is if you have dental work (braces, crowns, loose fillings, etc), you might want to stick with fruit strips. This is very chewy and may cause damage. I found that out the hard way. Otherwise, highly recommended!

review/summary: Fruity and easy to take along :-)
review/text: These fruit snacks come in individual wrappers, so they are good for lunchboxes and travel. They are moist, sweet and fruity - probably high in carbohydrates, but also concentrated with micronutrients. It's a pleasant way to get a serving of fruit when you are not close to a fruit stand.

Sure, a whole apple might be a little better for you, but these sure beat other snacks if you are looking for a little chewy, tart snack.

review/summary: Tart but tasty, my 20 month old loves them too
review/text: I got these through the amazon Vine program. It was nice that they sent a whole pack this time since it allowed both me and my son to try them out.<br /><br />If you look at the ingredients there is no added sugar, the sweetener is apple juice.  There are also some added vitamins in there which is an interesting idea for a fruit snack.<br /><br />When I tried them I thought there were very tart, almost sour, and definitely not overly sweet.  I liked the tartness though, as I am not a big sweet person.  They require a small effort to chew off a bite; not like jerky but tougher than a fruit roll-up.  I was worried that my 20 month old son would have trouble eating them because of the chewiness.<br /><br />Well, my 20 month old would give them 6 stars if he could.  He loves them.  I was surprised he liked them so much since they are a bit sour.  He does have to work some at chewing them; but he seems to like that, he kind of uses them as a teether.  Also they are coated in a light layer of oil so they aren't too sticky in his hands.  I don't know if I will get to eat any more of them because he got the box of them off the counter and has declared that the "Fruities are mine!"  I finally had to hide the box after he ate two of them, so he would lay off and find something else to do :-)<br /><br />All in all a great snack.  I like that all of the sugar is from fruit, that there are some added vitamins, and the taste is great too.  Great snack for my toddler too!

review/summary: Like a Tasty Organic Twizzler, way better than other so called "Fruit Snacks"
review/text: The Clif Kids Twisted Fruit rope is a great product.  It can replace those nasty "fruit flavored" roll ups and "fruit snacks" that are made primarily of corn syrup and artificial color and usually no fruit at all.  The twisted fruit rope is made out of actual furit, and even provides one serving per rope.  The ingredients are simple: apple puree, apple juice concentrate (makes it sweet), flavors, pectin, and fruit and vegetable colorings.  None of the chemicals from those bright "fruit flavored" concoctions, and everything is organic!<br /><br />The taste is great, too.  It's a bit tart, but with a nice berry flavor.  The texture is chewy, and it looks, tastes, and feels like a big Twizzler.  The ropes are packaged individually to throw in lunch boxes or backpacks, but I found myself reaching for at least 2 at a time.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I didn't like.  The strips are a little sticky;  it helps if you hold them by the wrapper instead of taking them out.  The sugar is also still fairly high.  There are 9 grams of sugar, a whopping 45% out of each 20 gram rope.  It's not added refined sugar, but the sugar comes from apple juice concentrate, which is much sweeter than natural apple juice.  Combine that with the sticky nature of the product and it's probably a good idea to have your kids rinse their teeth after eating one.<br /><br />Those drawbacks aside, these snacks remain far superior to candy or those gooey little "fruit snacks" as a tasty treat for kids (or adults!).  Keep in mind actual fruit is always a better choice, but if you need something portable, these are a great option.

review/summary: Awesome, heathy, low calorie boost for the active kid or adult.
review/text: I don't have any kids--that I know of--and I'm not a health nut but I eat a lot of Clif Bars while cycling.  It's the only real food that's truly portable and it comes in a great variety of flavors.  And now they've come out with the same sort of thing for active kids, at a portable and properly sized 70 calories of fruity fueling deliciousness.<br /><br />The thing that Clif understands that most people don't is, snacks are like kindling for the fire that keeps your internal engine going strong.  If you're sitting at your office desk drinking Gatorade and chomping down sports nutrition bars, you're really doing nothing more than producing fat and consuming too much salt (which is what electrolytes are), which increases your blood pressure, adds to stress, et cetera.  On the other hand, if you're out even just walking around the town or city that you live in for more than an hour at a shot (shopping, sightseeing, whatever), and eat something while continuing to move, your body will immediately use that to give you an energy boost, and will burn more calories--given that the activity level continues and is high enough to burn more than you are consuming--by turning to your fat stores next.  People know this instinctively, but tend to overconsume in those times of need.  The sudden influx of calories, particularly sugars, is like spraying lighter fluid on a fire that's already burning--which of course will suddenly burn hotter--ergo, you will lose weight or at least your endurance will increase if you're already thin--but if you consume too many calories at those times your body's systems will be overwhelmed (getting you ready for a recovery nap).<br /><br />I tested these out while cycling, where I usually go an hour before consuming anything but water, then eat a Clif Bar, and go on for another hour for my average ride or several hours during an event such as a 100 mile "Century" ride.  I found that because the twisted fruit rope is just sugary enough and has a good amount of carbs for fuels (with only 70 calories per serving), it gave me an immediate boost that lasted a good half hour.  I only consumed a 70 calories--the calories in one Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry--but during that 30 minutes I burned at least 250 calories (if it was a casual ride, which it wasn't).<br /><br /> (During a recent 100 mile bike ride, I burned about 900 calories per hour on average, for 6 hours, which is 5,400 calories or 1.5 pounds of fat, or 2.7 large pizzas worth of calories or 42 Hostess Cupcakes--or 36 PINTS OF GUINNESS!  I would need to eat 77 of these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit, Strawberry ropes to stay even at calories consumed vs. burned, and then add 2050 calories more to account for my resting metabolism.)<br /><br />But I'm not on the bike every day like I used to be, so like any office worker/weekend warrior, I have to do both--consume an enormous amount of calories while at play, and consume a minimum of calories during work days (Wall Street job, power sitting a good 10 hours a day).  This seems the perfect snack for both because it has an extremely reasonable amount of calories--only 70--and yet it's a refreshingly sweet item that will give me a nice little boost maybe twice a day.<br /><br />For a kid, this effect will be far better since kids are more active.  You could give a child two or three of these for the day and tell her/him to eat them whenever they like--which more than likely will be a bit before lunch, another in the afternoon, and another around when they're heading home.  Perfect.  Conversely, if you give your kids money for whatever snacks they like, inevitably they'll get all their calories at once, with lunch and likely from the highest calorie source (and the schools should be sued for selling candy in their cafeterias--so friggin irresponsible).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This kid sized snack is great for even us big kids who sit around all day working.  I don't have any children, but I'll be buying these for myself from now on.  Perfect nutrition for both work and play.

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Certified Organic. Kosher Parve. Sweet 'n tangy strawberry flavor. Wonderful fruity aroma. Fun. A single "rope" in an individually wrapped package. Perfect for on-the-go, a quick healthy snack, or your favorite anyone's lunchbag. 70 calories per snack. An organic healthy version of the red twizzlers I used to enjoy when I was a boy. Made with organic apple puree, organic apple juice concentrate, organic flavors, pectin, and fruit & vegetable juice colors. Clif is a trusted brand and leader in healthy organic energy bars and snacks. Another winner just for kids. Hide the box well from any 'big' kids and still young-at-heart adults. Highly recommended. [Received one box of 18 pieces at no cost through the Vine program.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices.

review/text: I give it credit for being organic but the flavor is off. I got the strawberry and I don't think it tastes like strawberry at all, maybe it's just me but I found that I don't really care for the flavor. The ingredients say everything is organic but it is made from apples and not straberries. It says it has organic flavoring but does not state what the flavoring is from. I don't think I would buy this again only because I didn't like the taste.

review/text: I really like the taste of these as well as the nutritional values. I know it says they are for kids but after trying them I think I might end up finishing them off myself J/K! I like to find snacks that are nutritious to give to the kids because I don't think starting a habit of eating a lot of junk food all the time is the right message to send. With these they taste good enough that its almost like giving them junk food without them knowing that its good for them.

review/summary: Awesome taste -- and no added sugar!
review/text: I like that this entirely made from organic ingredients, each serving has an entire serving of fruit, and it has no added sugar.  Even the coloring comes from fruit and vegetable juice.  The best part?  It tastes wonderful!  It has a tart strawberry flavor, and the texture is great.  It's not gritty at all, like some natural fruit snacks are.  I got Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruits to keep around for my grandchildren.  If they're lucky, I *might* still have some left when they get here!  I've definitely got to buy some more.  If I didn't already know these had no added sugar, I never would've guessed it from the taste.<br /><br />I've tried all the flavors.  They're all good, and they all have good texture, but strawberry is my favorite, probably because it tastes purer to me (only one fruit flavor, instead of two or more fruits competing for my taste buds).

review/text: This is a great item to keep in a desk drawer, brief case, glove box or purse to hold you over until the next meal.  Not only is it organic, but each stick is the equivalent of a serving of fruit.  (Another bonus: no artificial colors or preservatives.)<br /><br />I don't even LIKE strawberry flavored items...I prefer fresh strawberries. That's why this product came as a real surprise. The taste is tart and sweet and fresh.  Excellent!<br /><br />Also, the twisted stick form is easier to eat than the flat fruit "leathers" I tried.  Therefore it would be less messy in the hands of little ones.  (The wrapper can be slid down or pulled back like a banana peel, preventing sticky little fingers...a very helpful feature for snacking in the car.)

review/summary: Chewy Goodness
review/text: This Twisted Fruit is billed as a healthier alternative to other snacks targeted at kids.  This snack boasts one serving of fruit, a good source of vitamins C and B, and tastes almost as good as a less healthy alternative although the strawberry has almost a more grape taste than strawberry.  It also says it is fun it untwist and eat but it really isn't that easy to untwist and the snack itself is a little greasy to hold and you will be reaching to wipe your hands after eating.  Plus the snack does get caught in your teeth like other snacks of its ilk.  But the organic make up and the fact it does leave kids fairly full, adults may want two or more to be satisfied, makes this a much better alternative to the sugar snacks that currently flood the market.

review/summary: Tangy, Convenient, AND It's Healthy
review/text: I got these Clif Kid Twisted Fruit snacks because I'm a fan of other Clif brand products (Clif Bars, Luna Bars, Luna Minis) and I'm always looking for healthy food that's easy to eat on the go.  Even though I'm not a kid, I do enjoy having convenient, go anywhere fruit that I can eat.  I have tried various dried fruits and fruit leathers, but they are always either too dry and tough or too overly sugared.  Clif Twisted Fruit is a nice compromise, while still being all natural.<br /><br />Each twisted fruit is about 70 calories and has the "nutritional value" of a piece of fruit (so says the label).  I'm not sure how they really transfer the nutritional value of actual fruit into a processed product, so I wouldn't recommend this as a fruit substitute, but it does taste good.  The Strawberry flavor I tried is tangy and not overly sugared like most processed strawberry flavors.  The twist is brownish red, like natural strawberry preserves, not bright red. It is sort of gummy like fruit snacks, but the texture is not dry and tough.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed these fruit snacks.  My husband did too.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good lunch/snack food for either kids or adults--both sometimes need to be tricked into healthy eating!

review/summary: Not Just for Kids
review/text: Food is one of my obsessions, so I'm always happy to sample something that's possibly delicious AND healthful (and, to conform to my dietary restrictions, vegetarian). This turned out to be a good choice, with organic certification thrown in for good measure.<br />Clif Kid Twisted Fruit contains only fruit puree, fruit and/or vegetable juice, organic flavoring, and pectin. One serving contains a modest 70 calories and, considering the size of the serving, a fairly impressive daily percentage of several vitamins (mostly B's) and minerals. It's definitely the sort of snack you'd encourage your child to eat.<br />All of this, however, is meaningless unless the snack in question, shall we say, exceeds "palatable." No problem! The strawberry flavor explodes in your mouth as soon as you bite in, and it just gets better from there. The flavor is just sweet enough and very tangy, and the texture is chewy and smooth. I imagine that if soaked overnight in some water, a Twisted Fruit would be an excellent addition to a smoothie as well.<br />Twisted Fruits also work for grown-ups. They're easy to toss into a bag for a "whenever" pick-me-up and would be a nice, tasty way to take in some light nutrition after a workout. A versatile, healthful means of satisfying a sweet tooth (or, in my case, "teeth") that's appropriate for all ages.<br />BTW, MANY thanks to Clif Bar and Co. for providing such a generous sample for our review. I like to think that what goes around, comes around.  :)<br />Update: My friend's fruit-loving five-year-old went nuts for them. A hit with the target audience!

review/summary: Great for Adults
review/text: I have long been a big fan of Clif bars (Chocolate Brownie flavor), so I was eager to try this product. I was pleased to see that just one of these ropes equals a full serving of fruit, and that the added sweetening comes from fruit juice.<br />Texture is pleasingly firm, although a friend who tried it wondered whether kids would like it because it the "chew" didn't last long enough. The flavor is intense mainly because of the concentrated fruit content and there is an interesting "sweet-sour" flavor probably due to the added pectin. Kids who are used to very sweet fruit treats may not like this aspect, though.<br />Here's a Pro/Con list to summarize:<br />PRO<br />-Certified USDA organic<br />-Full serving of fruit in each rope<br />-No added sugar or high-fructose corn syrup<br />-Convenient (see comment about packaging, below)<br />CON<br />-Kids may not enjoy the sweet-sour flavor<br />-Individual packaging (it's a compromise between being convenient or being green)

review/summary: These are FANTASTIC...just not quite strawberry.
review/text: Delicious fruit-twists with a great, chewy texture - the twist is thick enough to feel substantial.  Way better than those "Fruit Roll-ups" of old times.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with kids or infants instead of other sweetened snacks (that would probably contain some kind of weird chemical)...this stuff is all natural.<br /><br />The 9 grams of sugar may be a bit much for an 2-3 year old to have more than one or two per day (unless you don't mind them running around with their arms above their head, bouncing off walls, and yelling with a big smile on their face.)<br /><br />On a final note - this review is for the Strawberry flavor.  While it does have sweetness and light strawberry flavor, it is rather "tart" for a strawberry.  In fact, the ingredients don't actually list "strawberries" anywhere in them:  Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.  With that said...the apple puree/apple juice taste like they were Granny Smith or maybe Gravensteins.<br /><br />So, while not exactly tasting like a fresh picked strawberry by any stretch of the imagination (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), they are very tasty.  (If given a Strawberry one without knowing which flavor it was prior, I don't think everybody would agree that it's strawberry.)  At any rate, I will certainly buy these in the future - will try other flavors to see if they all have "tart apple with hint of &lt;flavor>" flavored.

review/text: I'll be short and to the point.  This is a very good product.<br /><br />Each Clif Kid Organic Twisted Fruit serving has only 70 calories, but is all organic with no added sugar.  I think it's a great snack for adults as well as kids.  I'm one of those people with a sweet tooth and I've got to have some form of sweets around at all times.  One thing is for sure, munching on one of these is a lot better for you than reaching for that candy bar.<br /><br />The only slight criticisms I have is that it's a touch more tart than expected and the primary ingredients are "apple puree" and "apple juice concentrate" with no specific mention of strawberries.  Also, while the price is a reasonable value, it's not a terrific one.  I'd strongly recommend that you consider the "Subscribe and Save" option, which knocks an extra 15% off of the price.  You can always cancel S&S later if you change your mind, so there's no downside to signing up and it will save you money.

review/summary: Sadly, one of the only sources of fruit my son will eat!
review/text: I can not express how surprised (and happy!) I was to find out my son loves these fruit ropes.  The Mixed Berry were the first we tried and they are actually pretty tart.  I did not think that would go over well with a kid that really only tolerates a bland banana or apple every now and then.  But he LOVES them.  I added them to Subscribe and Save and almost every month I have to order more before the scheduled delivery.<br /><br />There's not much to them as far as a filling snack, but they apparently satisfy the little ones.  They are "dense" and chewy so they take a few minutes to eat and satisfy the craving to have a snack.  With a full serving of fruit and added nutrients, it seems like a no brainer.  When you include our neighbors that visit all the time, these are a hit with at least ages 3 to 10!<br /><br />I am anxious to try more flavors and will go for the Variety Pack next.

review/summary: My toddler LOVES them and so do I!
review/text: I gave my toddler one tonight after dinner as a treat...he got extremely excited and immediately went to work on it. It's not very big, but it certainly is a healthy choice and lasted him a few minutes! I love them too!

review/summary: Very good and very good for you
review/text: Usually, these products have way too much sugar and are not that healthy.  This one is organic and is low in calories.  I like it as much as my daughter does.  We purchased the variety pack on Subscribe and Save for extra savings too.

review/summary: Used this for our party favors
review/text: My son loved this healthy snack.  It comes in fun flavors, and looks like licorice.  It seems easier, i.e. less messy, for kids to eat than some of the other fruit strips out there.  And because of the packaging we were able to include them in the favor bags for his party as an alternative to candy.

review/summary: Not Sticky
review/text: The kids and I love this product. It is one Weight Watchers point. It is also not as sticky as some flat fruit leathers. Why eat high fructose corn syrup, sugary "fruit" snacks when you can eat the real thing.

review/summary: Yummy, Healthy Anytime Snack
review/text: I like to keep snacks on hand, but not the classic junk-type snacks.  These are perfect for our family.  The kids are able to grab them anytime they need something to munch on, and I don't worry about them OD'ing on chips or candy.  We love all the flavors; they're tart and chewy, just right for a sweets craving.

review/summary: These twists ROCK
review/text: These are awesome.  They are organic and one full serving of fruit.  They aren't flat, they are wide chewy twists, and they taste like CANDY!  I also love that they are fortified with some extra vitamins because my 3-year-old is a very picky eater.  Since they are pretty thick and a so chewy, I don't give them to my 1-year-old yet.  With him I stick with the flattened fruit.  Don't tell the kids, but I sneak a few of these to work to help get another fruit serving into my own diet.  I love the sour apple.  I just subscribed to get a box every month.  I didn't know you could do that.  Cool!

review/summary: My daughter loves it !
review/text: We tried this product sample at my daughter's daycare and she loved it. So I ordered a pack from amazon (along with another item to get the supersaver s/h discount) and its a nice treat for her. She calls it "fruit jelly". I tasted it and like it too !
