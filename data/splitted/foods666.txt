review/text: This is a very good tasting tea that steeps nicely into a light colored beverage. However, about 50% of the bags had tears in them or were otherwise unsealed.  I would buy again only as loose tea, as that is basically what came.  :-)

review/text: I have purchased this tea before and just love it but my latest purchase have inferior bags.  They break no matter how carefully you place them into the hot water or pour over.  The former bags were not the flow thru type and never broke.  These flow thru bags are very thin and cheaply made.  The tea still tastes great.

review/summary: Surprise!
review/text: I'm kind of an amateur when it comes to tea, but I've tried several kinds of oolong tea, mostly because of the supposed visceral fat-burning benefits.  [I can't really comment on the fat burning because I'm also dieting and exercising.]  But I can comment on the flavor of the tea.  I use one tea bag in an insulated mug of about 14 ounces, add a heaping teaspoon of Splenda, and leave it in the mug as I drink it over two to three hours.  Probably not the best way to drink tea, I know. Nevertheless, this tea has a good, moderately strong, pleasant flavor; holds its flavor; and does not have a bitter aftertaste like some of the others I have tried.  Best of all, this was very economical [$7 for a hundred bags, and eligible for free Prime shipping].  I highly recommend this tea and plan to buy it again.  Do watch to make certain it is specifically this brand and kind, since Foojoy has several that sound similar and I have tried one of the others that I did not like as well.  [...]

review/text: Most of the bags were broken and unusable... however, I eventually found a good bag and brewed some of this tea, and it was dreadful. It has tons of floating powder in it, and really sticks in your throat. The flavor is bitter and acrid, and nothing like what I have ever had in any Chinese restaurant. It's truly awful.

review/summary: Never recieved my whole order
review/text: I usually do not leave negative reviews. But I was so excited to order this tea at such a good price. I ordered two boxes. One for me and another for my friend. Well, I would just like to say that this was the worst experience I ever had with an online order. I ordered two boxes of this tea and only received one. Then I got one box of the tea, me thinking this is weired. I sent an email to the company. I had to wait at least 2 1/2 weeks to get a response from my email. Granted, the owner emailed me back and said he was out of the country and did apologize. His wife was helping him. The thing is, if the help is not good or don't know what they are doing. It is like leaving your business on auto pilot and hoping nothing goes wrong! Well it did, things went terribly wrong! I did not even try the tea. The box I did get I just put it to the side. The owner did refund my money for the one box I never got, I thank you for that to say the least. But over all next time please do not leave you business unmanned. The results are not good at all!

review/summary: Musty cardamom not fresh
review/text: I ordered this on 7/30/12. It came on 8/25/12 (not super fast, but not unreasonable coming from India). I wanted to be excited to get this product, but was initially worried about my cardamom because the small cardboard box was very warped and appeared as though it had gotten quite wet at some point. I hoped that the product inside had been packaged in a way that allowed it to remain dry. Boy was I disappointed (I've bought on amazon for years, and this is my very first review. Yep, I'm that unhappy). I cut the tape and looked inside. All of the pods were loose inside the box! They were not contained in any protective covering whatsoever. I removed the pods from the box and did locate a split plastic ziploc bag. Nothing else. It appeared as though it had no hope of keeping my product safe through the shipping process, and not just because of the split in the bag. Nope. It also was completely unsealed. I took pictures but there is no way for me to attach them to this review. The cardamom smelled musty, and I had to throw it away. I was very disappointed. I know accidents can happen, but placing my cardamom into a low quality plastic bag, failing to seal it, and tossing it into a cardboard box just doesn't cut it. This is a poor practice when shipping from so far. I cannot tell if the cardamom would have been fresh otherwise, I will not order again.

review/text: I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.

The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase.

review/text: I keep these in the house at all times.  They are a fabulous cookie- nice taste, not hard or crumbly.  I also use them as a pie crust.  I put them in the blender to chop them up, then mix in a bowl with melted butter.  I spray my pie dish with non-stick spray before pressing it in the plate.  My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc.

review/text: These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again.

review/summary: Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.

review/text: I purchased these cookies blind, I had not tasted this brand. They were a little crumbly, but not enough to affect the taste. I thought they were wonderful, with only a few broken ones in my delivered box. I would order these again.

review/text: I really struggled  finding a decent replacement for Oreo's. This is the closest thing I've found. It is a bit more grainy, due to the rice flour but the crispness is there and the chocolaty sweet taste of and Oreo is satisfied. Use it for recipes as well.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The "chocolate" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as "bite-size," they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.

review/summary: Gluten free, really? They taste AMAZING!!
review/text: Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste "good" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including "regular" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!

review/summary: Sometimes, they will gluten you.
review/text: I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.

review/text: We love these cookies, better than "K" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the "K" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the "K" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price.

review/text: Both my kids (8 and 4) love these cookies.  They have always been really crunchy.  We've never had them mushy like in another review.  They are not too sweet and have fun shapes.  Great for anyone gluten sensitive, and everyone else in the family.

review/text: These cookies were AWFUL!  Really bad.  My co-worker and I each bit into one and we couldn't finish it.  I tried one a week or so later when I was really hungry and it was still terrible.  Not only do they not taste good, but instead of being bland, they actually taste BAD and leave a horrible aftertaste.  I buy a lot of Gluten Free products and almost everything is really good but this was far from it.

review/summary: Excellent Quality - last a long, long, long, long time.
review/text: Purchased two of these from seller "Penguin Mints" (fulfilled by Amazon) and they arrived in fresh condition.  These are better than having 12 regular sized pops (approx an equivalent total weight) because they are so thick it takes literally an hour to get a piece soft enough to chew it off!  Great for satisfying a sweet tooth with actually very little sugar (per hour of enjoyment that is).  Of course, brushing after any sugary snack is important and these more so, since they take so long to consume (even a small portion of them) that you will be bathing your teeth in sugar for long periods of time (which is taking the fast lane for cavities).  Also, it's best to quickly rinse them and wrap them in wax paper or plastic wrap and place them in the fridge for storage between nibbling sessions.

review/summary: An extremely flavorful light-roast coffee
review/text: One of the pleasures of a Keurig is that you can serve a friend or a guest a cup of coffee that will please them and their tastes, not just what you brew for yourself everyday.  I happen to enjoy strong, deeply roasted blends (the kind that you usually find at the specialty coffee shops which seem to be all over the place now).  However, not everyone shares my enjoyment of a strong, full-bodied cup of coffee.<br /><br />I have many friends who often say something like "I love coffee but Starbucks is just too strong for me".  Enter Donut Blend.  I have purchased many boxes of Coffee People's Donut Shop Coffee and it is a favorite for many of my friends and family.  When Timothy's announced that they were coming out with the "Original Donut Blend" I got in line to try it.  Here is my take on it:<br /><br />It is certainly a little lighter than Coffee People's version but the taste is more complex with clean, bright notes of spice and low acidity.  Surprisingly, it reminds me a little of the Peaberry Kona coffee that I brought back from Hawaii.  It is a perfect blend for those who like their coffee black or with just a little cream and still want it to taste like coffee.  If someone drinks several cups a day I think that Timothy's Donut Blend will not overwhelm their taste buds and will still taste fresh cup after cup.  Mind you, I drink Newman's Own Bold Blend on a regular basis and will continue to do so, but if I am having more than two cups (for those "special" mornings when nothing seems to go right) or if I am having a cup later in the day I will drink this one.<br /><br />Just rating it on what I want in a coffee I give it four stars, but judging it for what it is (and not just what I like), it fully delivers and deserves five stars.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK">Coffee People Medium Extra Bold, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>]

review/summary: Our Top Choice Coffee
review/text: When my wife and I had to make a selection from more than 100 varieties of<br />K-Cups available for our new Keurig brewer, we made a rating sheet copied<br />from the Keurig listing of all the brands and types.  We marked a rating<br />of one to five points for each cup we drank for several months. A rating<br />of one point meant "Perfect, couldn't be better", and five points<br />indicated "Don't like this one".  We rated one to nine cups of each of 30<br />coffees evaluated.  Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights came out on top<br />with the most number one ratings.<br /><br />We found that our preference was for the Extra Bold Roasts.  We do not<br />prefer the weaker strengths.  The Parisian Nights has great flavor and<br />aroma with no bitterness.  This is a great cup of coffee.<br /><br />We're now on our sixth Subscribe and Save shipment of 4 boxes every two<br />months which proves our satisfaction with this coffee.

review/summary: Best Chocolate Flavor by Far
review/text: I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.  Enjoy!!

review/text: I bought a Keurig coffee maker for Christmas this year. We all enjoy different coffees in our household and making a pot of any type coffee is a waste. My husband is an espresso drinker, so I purchased Timothy's World Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso coffee to be made with the small setting on the coffee maker which uses 5.25 oz water. This makes it stronger, and he really has enjoyed this coffee. I really recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bold espresso coffee. He was born and raised in Italy and has purchased his coffee grounds from Italy for years to make an authentic cup of espresso. He is fussy about his espresso, so if he likes this one, it must be good.

review/summary: Need to brew small cup size.  Check the price!
review/text: I have been getting the Coffee People Extra Bold Donut Shop K-Cups but I used to buy and enjoy some of the Timothy's coffees too so I thought I'd try this.  Our family are Dunkin Donut coffee fans.  We even fill the my k-cup with preground DD coffee occasionally.  I found the Timothy's Donut Blend to be very bland, almost watery.  I have the Keurig that allows 4 sizes of cups to be brewed.  I usually brew on the 3rd largest size.  I decided to try this coffee with a smaller cup and it was better, but I wish it worked well at the larger sizes.<br /><br />This probably explains the discrepancies in the reviews.  Those who can only brew (or choose to brew) smaller sizes probably like this coffee.<br /><br />Make sure you check the price before you buy.  Click more buying choices to get to Amazon's price which is almost half the price of Liquid Nation's and it is eligible for prime.  Why doesn't that show up as a default?

review/summary: If you prefer a smooth cup of coffee
review/text: I purchased this item after reading through the reviews on Amazon.  I have to say that I haven't been disappointed. The cups contain a blend of arabica and kona coffee.  They brew with a nice aroma and color.  I would describe them as a medium roast with a medium strength.  Depending on your mood you can adjust the strength by adjusting the cup size and changing your creamer.  I've had success using whole milk, half and half, and light cream, with light cream being the best in my opinion.  The taste is mellow and very smooth.  I have read other reviews here that have described them as weak or tasteless.  This is simply not the case.  I would compare it to the coffee from Dunkin Donuts.  If you prefer your coffee extra bold, dark roasted, or strong (Starbucks) then you are just not going to be happy with these.  Also, if you prefer to "double brew" your cups to get the most for your money, you will be very disappointed.  These will brew a delicious cup of coffee, but only if you use them as directed.  Finally I have to say that Amazon is the best place to buy these.  They have the best prices and fast shipping.  Add this to your subscribe and save to get 15% extra off.

I add it to many of my dishes and it always enhances it. Especially, if my dish turned out a little sweeter than I wanted it. This spice evens it out. Of course, the more you use the hotter it is. Go light, taste & sprinkle more if needed. You can always add but you can't take it out once it's in there. My whole family likes it.
