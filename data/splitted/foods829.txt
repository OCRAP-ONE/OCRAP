review/summary: Best almonds ever!
review/text: These Salt and Vinegar Almonds are one of the best snack foods I have ever tasted!  They're just tangy enough to give you a good kick.  Hard to find in my local stores, so I came to Amazon and bought a case  :-)

review/summary: only for lime lovers
review/text: I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi.

review/text: I originally found the big jar of these at Costco. They had them for about a minute and then they were gone. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I'm hooked on these almonds. If you like anything salt & vinegar, you'll love 'em! Now if Amazon could offer the large economy-size jar, all would be right with the world.

review/text: I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel "mouth-satisfied" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value.

review/summary: Full of flavor
review/text: To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor.

review/summary: Wasabi Soy Flavor is too salty!
review/text: I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, "hey that happens, no big deal..." A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, "hey that happens, it's hot out..." But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, "hey these are really salty" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty.

review/text: I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought "When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too.

review/text: We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!<br />By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here.

review/summary: A good flavor but not bold in comparison to some of the other flavors and more salt!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word "Bold" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.<br /><br />If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a "Bold" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

review/summary: Fast, Simple, Delicious
review/text: I am constantly on the lookout for new ways to cook fish and avoid a bit of red meat.  This curry paste tastes great and is so fast.<br /><br />No one yet has detailed the preparation so here goes, take notes, it's complicated:<br /><br />1. Dump 1 lb of firm white fish into a pan.<br />2. Put in the paste and 2/3 cup water.<br />3. Bring to boil then reduce to simmer for 10 minutes.<br /><br />Serve over rice (what I did), roti,or naan(?)<br /><br />I put some coriander in at the last minute to give it some color, and added some onions.  Very good. Hot (I sweated a bit) but good hot.  They suggest adding 2 tbs grated coconut as a variation, I think it will be just as good with shrimp or shellfish as with the cod I used.<br /><br />Very pleased.

I may try making a potato curry using a bag of those pre-diced-potatoes-with-onion (not sure if I can Simply say the brand name :-) that you find in the deli case at the supermarket.

review/summary: A bit too salty, but other flavors are nice
review/text: I love Indian food and often buy various curry pastes in a local Indian store.  I decided to try Kitchen of India Curries, and this Fish Paste was the first one I have tried.<br /><br />I am attaching 5 photographs I took along my preparation.<br /><br />The paste comes in a silver blister pack that can be stored without refrigeration for a long time.  So these packages are good to keep on hand when you need a quick meal. Photo shows blister pack just taken out of the package.<br /><br />The second photo shows the paste removed from the package, so you can see the amount you get in package.<br />The recipe on the box tells us to add 2/3 of the cup of plain water and dissolve the paste.  Dissolved paste is shown on the next photo.  The paste dissolved easily, it only took a few minutes.<br />The fourth photo shows salmon covered with the fish sauce about to go into a microwave.<br />The fifth photo shows the cooked dish ready to be consumed with some rice.<br /><br />Overall, I liked the flavors, however I found the sauce too salty for my taste.  I had scrape it off the fish to enjoy it more, however what penetrated the fish and a little of the sauce that was left mixed with rice tasted very good.<br /><br />I think next time, I will try dissolving the paste in 1 cup coconut milk or 1 cup of water  (upping the amount recommended on the box) to dilute the salty flavor more.<br /><br />The box said that there is enough paste for 4 servings, and in fact this was exactly right.  The amount you see in the photos will be 4 servings of fish.  Each serving of sauce is 45 calories.  I suspect it was less for me since I did not eat all of the source due to saltiness.  The amount of Sodium per serving is 580 mg.  I bought a variety pack, so I compared the amount of Sodium in Fish curry to other flavors from Kitchens of India, and Fish curry has the second lowest amount among the 6 flavors.  So this tells me to dilute the next one I try more than I plan to dilute this one.<br /><br />So bottom line: I found the flavor to be pleasant, and the I believe the saltiness can be improved by using more water/coconut milk to dissolve the paste than recommended on the package.

review/summary: Stupidly good!
review/text: I -love- curries and I'm not even Asian. I especially love strongly flavored curries. When I first picked the fish curry paste up I didn't expect much from it being pre-made and packaged but MAN...so good! The curry itself doesn't need anything added to it, just water. As for the fish, I've tried several and I found that swai works the best. I've yet to try salmon, though. The most prep you'd have to do is lightly season the fish even if it's just salt and pepper. I don't know how exactly this changes the flavor notes, but when I skipped this step, it wasn't as good. The fish didn't take to the curry as well. I don't add anything extra to it, but if I'm feeling adventurous I chop up a fresh tomato and toss it in about 2-3 minutes before serving while it's still simmering. Then I garnish with finely chopped cilantro---Let me stop. I can go on about this stuff for HOURS o____o.

We were using brands of dog food you find in the grocery store until a trainer opened our eyes to the difference in qualities of dog food & the effect it can have on behavior as well as overall health. There are 2 websites we checked before we chose Premium Edge Healthy Weight II, one was  the Whole Dog Journal 2010 Approved Food List ([...]),the other was Dog Food Analysis ([...]). On both websites this food is recommended. Both dogs absolutely LOVE this food & I feel so much better knowing that they are getting quality food.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery.

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

review/text: Actually until the recall I was very impressed w/this dog food, & I have used it for a long time.<br />So I ordered this dog food and I also ordered professional cat food, and just my luck as it usually is with these dog food recalls, I happen to have a bad bag. Actually, I'm not sure why but I guess I assumed that Amazon might have dropped me a line to let me know that there was a recall & that i may have received a bag (or two) of the bad pet food.<br />Now my question is, what do I do with it & how can I get reimbursed for it? Or can I?

review/summary: Great For Dog With Allergies
review/text: My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/summary: Looks like good stuff!
review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/text: Our source for this dog food went out of business. It was highly recommended by our dog trainer and wasn't out of line on cost. We couldn't find it anywhere and I jokingly asked my wife to check at Amazon. To our shock, you had it, at the same price and you had it delivered right to our front door, all at the same price.  Unreal.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend.

review/summary: Superb, top of the line dry dog food
review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

review/text: I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!

review/text: My dog is 3 and he has been chewing and licking his paws for as long as I can remember.  Probably half his day was spent chewing and licking.  He has had many steroid shots and has been taking claritin twice a day for several months.  Nothing has worked....I decided to try this dog food before taking him to a specialist and it has been amazing.  He has been eating the salmon and potatoes formula exclusively for about a week and a half and now he is hardly ever licking his paws!!!  Today I even skipped his claritin and he has not licked his paws all day.  No more grains for my dog!

review/summary: Not so great..Expiration date soon..
review/text: I decided to try this dry food on my two dogs, because of all the great reviews.<br /><br />However....Neither dog will eat it.  One dog took a couple bites, and refuses to eat it..The other dog wont even take a bite.<br />I tried mixing it with their favorite can food, but this only made matters worse.  They would not even touch it.<br /><br />I was confused about this, since one of my dogs will eat just about anything, while the other will eat dry food mixed with cannned.<br />The reviews were all good, so...<br /><br />I checked the package...And, I think I may have found the answer...There is a last sale date of April 11, 2012....That's only about 6 weeks away.<br />I would never purchase a food that was going to expire so soon, even on sale in a store.<br /><br />I now have a huge bag of dog food in the kitchen..I have tried daily to give each dog a little, but no go.  They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

The only improvement he mentioned is that it is a bit too sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to order some for my family  to try too, but as of now, it is not in stock directly from Amazon and the prices from the sub-sellers are ridiculous!

review/text: I literally could not live without the Monthly Comfort tea. A friend recommended it to me for "the time of the month" and I tried it skeptically - especially as I am not a mother, a soon to be mother, or motherly at all. I start drinking at least a cup of this three to four days before my cycle, and find that most of the monthly annoyance of being a woman subsides. What was a week of unpleasantness, with two days of insomnia because the pain is so bad has no turned into a day or two max of light cramps, with no bloating either.<br /><br />To me it tastes like cinnamon and ginger, with raspberry undertones. It tastes delicious enough that I often have it all month long, not just on my cycle. It's especially pleasant on a chilly morning.<br /><br />I buy this in bulk now, because running out is simply not an option!

review/summary: Exceptional product!
review/text: I've battled horrific periods for years, especially after the birth of my second child.  I wish I would have known about this many years ago!  This tea is absolutely fantastic.  I typically have issues with gaining upwards of 10 lbs of water weight during my menstrual cycle - not this time.  Cramping is significantly reduced, water weight is non-existent, even my husband commented on my much improved monthly demeanor.<br /><br />The tea is easy to make, though I would certainly recommend steeping for a solid 15 minutes for best results.  I drink two cups of this tea each day (morning and afternoon) starting a few days before my cycle and all the way through.  I do not normally enjoy tea, but I have to say, this is delicious.  I didn't even need to add sugar or other sweetener to mask the taste.<br /><br />I have used most of the Earth Mama tea products, and have been impressed by the high quality, delicious flavors, and natural remedies for my ails.  I highly recommend giving this product a try.

review/summary: Uhm um good and really spicy!
review/text: If you like it hot - this is the soup for you.  Lots of good taste, but be aware that it is very spicy hot!  One of my favorite soups with chunks of chicken and sausage slices. Very good!

review/summary: Great Soup!!!
review/text: This soup is packed with great tasting chunks of chicken, sausage and vegies. It has a mildly spicey taste and an excellent balance of broth to meat/vegies ratio.  This is one of the best tasting soups I've ever eaten out of a can. Excellent gumbo soup that will make you will eat like a pig!

review/summary: My favorite from Campbell's.
review/text: My friend that lived in New Orleans for 10 years and worked in restaurants there makes an excellent, authentic gumbo, the best I've ever had.  If I could convince him to keep me well-stocked with his homemade gumbo I probably wouldn't buy this soup.  Unfortunately, this is the real world and you don't always get what you want.<br /><br />That said, this gumbo I thought was surprisingly good, and I've gone through a couple cases of it.  Lots of spice and flavor.  Obviously homemade soup by an experienced cook is always preferable to canned, but this is a very reasonable and quick alternative.

review/summary: a hearty soup
review/text: This is my favorite soup.  It is so chocked full of meat and rice that it makes a great meal.  My husband likes a soup with more liquid and I like a full bodied soup.  We are both happy when a can of water is added and one chicken bouillon.  The bit of "heat" gives it extra character.  Stock up on this one.  It is a great price.
