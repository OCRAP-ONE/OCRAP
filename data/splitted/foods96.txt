The image here is an old one that should be updated.<br />The packaging was great with thermal insulation and cold packs for the chocolate not to melt in the hot summer.<br />the price is really the lowest. I searched the internet to find a better price and the best I got was 7.50 usd per each + shipping.<br />That's why I said it is JUST PERFECT. It made my day

review/text: I'm a long time fan of Lindt chocolate which I like the most among inexpensive and widely available brands.<br />This mikl chocolate is very tasty. My only small complaint is that there are far fewer hazelnuts than the packaging makes you believe ... probably on average one nut per large quadrant (the picture on the packaging shows 4 nuts per quadrant)!

review/summary: Le Cabanon Harissa
review/text: Harissa is a very spicy North African red-pepper paste condiment, typically made at home or bought in jars. This is an item to use sparingly, brushed on grilled meat or vegetables, or mixed into sauces and marinades.<br /><br />I had bought a tube of this brand at a specialty store in Berkeley, but was not able to find it again. The other brand I could find was adequate, but the texture was too pasty and the flavor not so fresh. I was delighted to find Le Cabanon offered for sale here. The shipping price for one tube was in my opinion prohibitive, but the product stays fresh indefinitely in the sealed tubes, so I had no qualms about buying six at a time. This brought the price per tube to about a dollar less than I'd paid in the store!

review/text: Either I got 15 tubes that came from a bad batch lot or they are not selling the right Harissa. I bought 15 tubes thru Amazon from Parthenon Foods and used 4 of them so far and after putting the whole tube it still isn't spicy at all. Normally a whole tube would get you to sweat a bit!!!!! This seems to be a case of false representation. I buy these tubes in Canada at the grocery store all the time when I am up there and they provide a nice kick and spice (as they should). What's up with dat?

review/summary: Bought in quantity, tubes deteriorated within 6 months
review/text: To purchase these, you must buy 6 tubes and pay expensive shipping costs.  I was excited and willing because I love this flavor, but over time, I realized the unopened tubes were leaking on the box and the boxes were sticking to my pantry shelf.  I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16/11/2012. (European labeling)  The tubes appear to be about to explode which leads me to believe there could be possibly be bacterial contaminants?  I don't know, but something made these packages leak on the crimped edges. Obviously, I would not recommend OR buy them again.

review/summary: This is flavored tomato paste, not Harissa
review/text: I wish I had taken Tamdidelam's review more seriously before ordering. My family has a vacation home in Tunisia. I always bring some Harissa home with me, either in a glass jar or in a tube. I was excited to find this on Amazon, but it has nothing in common with the original Harissa. Harissa is a pasty substance that is very hot - way hotter than Tabasco or other brands of hot sauce common in the US. Harissa contains seeds of chili peppers. This product is barely spicy at all and the consistency is more like tomato paste. Tomato is listed as the main ingredient, hot pepper (piment) less than 8%.

review/text: I've sampled several varieties of Eden Organic beans; this is the only one which i found to taste truly awful.  Of course taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary.  My advice, before committing to a case purchase, is to first sample this variety by buying a single can from a local store.  If that's not an option for you, then you might consider moving on to another variety.  I can recommend their black, pinto, and great northern beans.  If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, you might consider their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMUOE">Aduki Beans</a>.<br /><br />I like the fact that all Eden Organic beans are in BPA free cans.  Too bad that not all their canned products are BPA free (e.g. as of this writing, Eden canned tomatoes, soups, etc. have BPA linings).

review/text: I like these peas for having nothing but the pea in the can. Read the sodium levels on a can of beans these days, might as well drink sea water. Yes these are bland, no bacon, salt or artificial flavors, simply peas. A pinch of salt, some spices, rice & hot sauce or mayo like my granddad adds and I can make lunch or dinner from a can of these puppies. I keep these to wolf down on days I have gone too long without food and need something fast. Stock trading does not lend itself to eating healthy or at all most days. Canned blackeyes are fast, filling and healthy but will not rock your world flavor wise. For me they fill the nutrition hole and keep junk food from finding my mouth, that alone makes them 5 star.

Great for quick meals and a very reasonable price compared to the cost per can at a regular grocery store. Other pros include: BPA free can,organic, no added salt, limited ingredient list (peas,water,seaweed). Please note that you can't even tell the seaweed is in the can. I flavor mine with a little onion and garlic powder, a pinch of sea salt, and freshly ground black pepper. Add a little liquid smoke for a smokey taste without added fat,sodium,or meat. All in all a good product.

review/summary: Best Graham Cracker I've Ever Tasted
review/text: I bought these on super sale because I needed them for a pie crust and they were cheap.  I got the 3-pack and was at first dismayed to find that they were not packed like other graham crackers are usually packed, they were loose in a bag, not stacked in bricks to fill the box  -- this meant there were many less per box than I had anticipated.  But when I tried one I was immediately impressed, they taste fantastic!<br /><br />These taste nothing like the kind of graham crackers we were fed in kindergarden, they have actual flavor and are much more than just an ingredient or child's fare.  What these lack in volume they make up for in quality.<br /><br />I immediately ordered three more 3-packs while they were so cheap, I have a toddler at home and am happy to supply us all with these wonderful graham crackers.  They do not have any scary fillers or ingredients; they are made with butter and not trans fat, and you can snack on nine of them with your coffee for only 130 calories -- not bad!<br /><br />They also make a pie crust that is noticeably better than what I used to make dessert crusts with.<br /><br />I was so impressed at what Stonewall Kitchen could do to a graham cracker that I am going to check out other products they make.

Because these were not near as good as the other Virginia Peanuts I've had or ordered from Amazon in the past.  The "Royal Oak" in the blue can is what I got last time and they were much larger, not broken, crunchier, and just better tasting.  Seemed silly to return 2/3 of the order, and they are not really awful, completly fine actually, but my expectations were for a premium product. Fairly decent peanut, but these are suposed to be the best.  They were not.  Going to order the Royal Oak next time.

review/summary: OK peanuts
review/text: I have bought many brands on peanuts on Amazon. I was a tad disappointed in this brand. The Peanut Shop Of Williamsburg. The over all flavor was ok. Not a strong flavor but not weak. I found the salting to be a little on the light side. That's fine with me, I use most of my nuts in kung-pow type dishes, and the lower salt is fine. The crispness was very poor for a hand cooked kettle peanut. It really should have more crunch/snap.  Over all this is a step up from Planters cocktail peanuts. But you can do much better with other brands.

review/text: The peanuts were of average quality. They were large enough and salted properly, but they were hardly crisp. In my opinion, they are still better than those that you will find in a supermarket, but nothing really exciting.

review/summary: Change in size of product
review/text: I have been receiving Peanut Shoppe of Williamsburg peanuts through the Subscribe and Save plan.  When I first ordered them, each can contained 12 ounces of product, but the most current shipment reduced the size of the product to 10.5 ounce cans and kept the price the same.  I think that is a bit misleading. If there is less product, why isn't it less expensive?

review/text: I opened the box with the 3 cans of peanuts and all 3 cans had a large dent on the side. There was no damage to the box so obviously the cans were damaged prior to the packaging. At least the peanuts were OK. Maybe we are being sold "seconds" through Amazon by this company. Buyer beware or you may receive peanut butter rather peanuts from this company.

Upon researching some other food products, I found it on your site.  It was about 1/3 the price of the in store packets. Over time we have also started using it with chicken, even on baked potatoes, and it is delicious and makes anything you use with it taste more "special".  I will buy again and again!

review/summary: Amazingly Lifelike
review/text: I grew up in a diabetic household so I have always been aware of the difference between "people" food and "diabetic" food. Of course it was only recently that I was put on the non-people stuff exclusively.<br /><br />These candies are surprisingly satisfying. I have a doc who says artificial sweeteners are for those who haven't yet admitted that they aren't allowed to have a sweet tooth any longer. May be true but these little candies are quite nice.<br /><br />They are, in fact, hard. That is a nice change from diabetic candies when I was a child. They have a decent mouth feel and an almost caramel taste. I don't catch an aftertaste. So, when I "need" a fix, these are nice to have around the house. Won't mistake them for "people" candy but these really are amazingly lifelike.

review/text: In trying to cut down on sugar, I have tried several products that contain sugar alcohols and found that I do not tolerate them well. As in gut wrenching pain and embarassing gas attacks. I know that some people can consume these products with little effect but I am not one of them. I don't know what I was thinking except that maybe it has been a few years and perhaps they have made new strides in sugar alcohol technology.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, these are so tasty, I ate several in the first setting. In a car with two other people. On a long drive. Let's just say I won't be doing that again any time soon. For those who are not troubled by sugar alcohols, enjoy!

Well, sometimes I'll try a candy substitute and on my last trip to the grocery store, I spotted some bags (2.75 ounces) of Werther's Original Hard Candies (Sugar Free). They're very low in calories. Okay, are they any good? Well, they taste a little like a very weak creamy caramel hard candy. I tired of them after the third one. They have a bit of an illusion of candy, but just don't match up. I doubt that I'll finish the bag. Oh well, maybe it's for the best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

Unfortunately, the candies -- while very tasty -- played havoc with our systems. We couldn't eat more than 8 at one time (5 for me) without getting crampy & gaseous. At first we didn't realize it was the candies causing the effect, but that changed quickly. We had to discard the rest of the product. What a shame.

Unlike most sugar free candy, these taste exactly like their sugar cousins and there is absolutely no after taste - none. You don't realize that they are sugar free unless someone tells you they are. Perfect for diabetics who want a snack but can't handle the sugar. Keep a package handy and you'll not be sorry.

review/summary: My new favorite cookie from Pamela's
review/text: I've been eating gluten free for about seven years, and a couple of Pamela's cookies with a cup of decaf have gotten me through my 4 p.m. "low" many times in those years. When I first discovered them, I loved all the shortbread styles. Then I moved into the chocolate chip versions. Most recently it was the peanut butter, with and without chips.<br /><br />I love them all, but this raisin and walnut cookie may be my all-time favorite. It's tender, chewy and generously studded with nuts and raisins. Unlike some of the others, which can be a little sweet for my taste, this one seems to rely on the raisins more than sugar for sweetness. After eating one or two, I feel like I've eaten something that might be good for me (and not just totally self-indulgent).<br /><br />Like all the Pamela's cookies, they're a little pricey, but the prices here on Amazon are definitely the best I've found. (Likewise for the Bob's Red Mill GF bread mixes, which are also wonderful.) Thanks, Amazon, for your great selection of GF foods.

review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

review/summary: excellent superlight substitutes for palmiers
review/text: Many of Bahlsen's cookies are too sweet and floury for my taste, but these light flaky cookies don't taste stale and are not too rich but are nice and do not taste like sugared cardboard.  I don't crave these but when you eat them, you realize that these are better than the average boxed cookies and unexpectedly delicate and fresh tasting given the supermarket price.

review/text: The title says it.  Some of the cookies arrived with the chocolate melted.  Others were stuck together or had the wafer separated and stuck to the chocolate top of the cookie below.  It appears that the box was a little overheated and banged around somewhere along the way here.  It was 65F here when the package was delivered.

review/summary: The perfect cookie
review/text: Rich, dark chocolate thinly covering a tart orange marmalade-like substance on a soft sponge cookie. It melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. Chocolate and orange are an addictive combination.  There are other brands out there of these sponge cookies, but the Bahlsen brand is by far tops in the quality of the ingredients used.

review/text: Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida. We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now).

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/summary: Great cookies--don't buy in the summer
review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/text: I don't know what Bahlsen was thinking over the last several months, but I looked high and low for these cookies in supermarkets and specialty stores...none were to be found. Then, after checking with Amazon (and its tracking mechanisms), Voila!

review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.
