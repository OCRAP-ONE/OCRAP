review/summary: Tastes Great and is helping me lose lots of weight!
review/text: Love the taste, first off!  I have only tried the vanilla flavor and it has been wonderful.  The idea behind me taking this protein drink is actually two-fold.  The first is to not eliminate but lower my coffee drinking addiciton (i.e. starbucks use ot be a morning ritual!) and also because it has some calories but not too many, I've been using it as a meal replacement for breakfast time.  I'm trying to lose weight, and this is helping me get closer to my goal weight.<br /><br />Since each serving is only 100 calories, you should be prepared for that you will feel hungry about an hour after you drink it.  I started taking Yohimbine Powder, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005XOUOA4">5 Grams Yohimbine HCL 99% Bulk Powder</a> shortly after starting to drink these shakes, and if you are trying to cut back on calories, I highly recommend some kind of natural appetite suppressant, you have no idea the difference it makes, basically a life-saver for me as I'm what you would call a snacker of snacks!<br /><br />I know some other reviewers have said that stiring the mix works for them but I'm sorry if you really want to enjoy this shake, you need a blender, plain and simple.  I could sit there in my kitchen and stir for an hour and it still won't taste nearly as good compared to blending it for thirty seconds.

review/summary: Subtly Sweet Vanilla with a KICK.
review/text: Vanilla is close to the top of the list of my favorite flavors -- my fave protein supplements have been mostly vanilla based.  Add espresso to that, this HAS to be a winner.  I got my hands on an advance sample of CLICK Vanilla Latte.  And, completely ignoring the fact that my espresso machine is dead, this was the perfect day to try it out.<br /><br />As with any CLICK protein flavor - the suggested method of serving is to add the protein powder to 12-14 ounces of water, and mix well either cold, or warm it up.  I added 14 ounces of steaming water from my hot tap on the water dispenser.<br /><br />It was lighter in color than the Mocha Flavored CLICK, more like a cappuccino.  It even frothed, but that could have been from the psycho blending I do to it.  It definitely tastes like a vanilla latte, perhaps not the way I order it (Hi there extra shots!) but very taste-friendly to the espresso virgin.<br /><br /> The verdict.  HELL YES.  Thank you CLICK, I loves it.<br /><br />Product - CLICK Espresso Protein Powder Vanilla Latte Flavor<br />Price - Amazon varies.<br />Via - Amazon<br />Pros - 15 grams of ass kicking protein that you could never guess was a protein drink.<br />Cons - Not as strong as it's big sister.<br />Rating - Pouchworthy, MM.

review/summary: Tasty protein. Watch the carbs.
review/text: Very nice tasting protein powder. Tastes like a nice iced coffee. Doesn't dissolve completely, though. I mixed mine well, and it was still a little clumpy. Not enough to ruin the drink, but enough to get a couple surprises of powder.<br /><br />One thing I don't like is the amount of carbs. 12 grams is a lot when you're only getting 15 grams of protein. I do like that's it's low in calories, though. One of the lowest I've seen, and for a decent sized shake.

review/summary: Excellent product (a little tweaking makes it better).
review/text: I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using.

review/summary: Oh CLICK, where have you been all my life??
review/text: I had gastric bypass surgery 16 months ago, and have spent all this time searching in vain for a tolerable protein powder to meet all my nutritional requirements.<br /><br />Then I found CLICK, and everything changed.  Yes, it was THAT MAJOR.  I add 6 ice cubes and milk, some sugar-free white chocolate and peppermint syrups, a couple of stevia packets, and top it with a dollop of whipped cream.  It is so good that I feel guilty drinking it - better than anything I've ever had from Starbucks.  I am obsessed.  OBSESSED, I tell you!<br /><br />Try it, people.  You won't regret it.

review/summary: MM runs on CLICK
review/text: Espresso, chocolate, and, PROTEIN, 15 grams in one serving.  It can be made hot or cold, I tried it both ways about eight times now, and I love it.  (You know I don't just throw that out there, I am a tough cookie.)<br /><br />For the sake of a simple review, I tasted it AS THE PACKAGE DIRECTED and it was just perfect.<br /><br />I prepared it cold, and look, I sucked this down, and then I cleaned the bathroom in a single bound, I did!<br /><br />As a hot drink, it's also delightful - you literally just mix it as you would any hot powdered drink like a cocoa.  I highly suggest a whisk, and do it well, and you get the best results.  This mix really has a smooth mocha flavor.<br /><br />I've been drinking it hot in my morning cappuccino - I whisk one or two scoop into some hot water to mix, then a shot of espresso and then top it off with steamed unsweetened soy milk, and it makes an AMAZING morning cup.<br /><br />I've already thrown it into protein shake concoctions in the blender, and it's OMG!? DELICIOUS with blended ice and additional flavors.  (THINK ABOUT THE OPTIONS HERE PEOPLE!)<br /><br />The nutrition:<br /><br />  * 2 scoops contain:<br />  * 120 calories<br />  * 1.5 grams of fat<br />  * 115 mg sodium<br />  * 290 mg potassium<br />  * 12 carbohydrate<br />  * 1 fiber<br />  * 7 sugar (fructose)<br />  * 15 protein<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with Click Protein.  There is NO telltale protein-y taste, you that icky tongue-feel and after taste you might get with other protein products?  I don't know how it's possible, but it's true - you cannot tell that this is a protein drink by any stretch.<br /><br />Add that to the fact that it contains my two main food groups, espresso and chocolate?  It's a clear winner, and my new thing.<br /><br />[...]

review/summary: Wow. WOW! So Good!
review/text: This is, so far, my very favorite protein shake.<br /><br />If you love coffee then you should follow the directions- the mocha flavor is nice and strong in 12 oz of fluid (I do milk, to up the protein content; more on that later).  If you like coffee with chocolate flavor then this is the mix for you!<br /><br />Personally, I like putting 16 oz of milk in a Blender Bottle (with the genius blender ball) and then two scoops of Click powder.  I personally love mocha when the chocolate is predominant with a hint of coffee, and this tastes like chocolate milk with a delicious coffee undertone.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the protein content is a little bit low (15g per serving) and it's $1.50 a serving.  Honestly, it's so good that the money is worth it.  It's also way less spendy- at least half the cost of your average drink- than getting a mocha at a coffee stand and far healthier.  As far as the protein goes, if I do the 16 oz of milk then I get 33 grams of protein in a shake.  Not too bad, and again, it tastes so great!<br /><br />As an RNY gastric bypass patient I find it difficult to in 80 grams of protein from shakes per day, particularly because most things just don't taste that great.  This is the first protein drink I've had that is genuinely good, not just, "Meh, I guess that's ok for a protein drink."  I fully recommend this to anyone!!<br /><br />Lastly, you can search around for other recipes- some people add a scoop of vanilla protein powder and a splash of drip coffee, or drip coffee and sugar free vanilla syrup, etc.  I also hear Click makes DELICIOUS protein ice cream, and I plan to give that a go in the upcoming weeks.  If it is delicious I'll leave this as is.  If it's nasty (which, based on how great this stuff tastes, then I doubt it will be!) I'll edit my review to reflect that.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: I live off this stuff!!!
review/text: I've tried many protein powders, shots, and suppliments over the last 4 years.  I finally decided that a coffee flavor was the only one I could enjoy.  I used Whey Gourmet Artic Cappuccino Frappe but had to add ice, vanilla almond milk, extra instant coffee, and even a splash of creamer to get the desired "fresh from starbucks" flavor.  That's a lot of additional cost and calories.  I decided to give Click a try and purchased both the Mocha and the Vanilla Latte.  I'm hooked on the Vanilla Latte.  The Mocha was too sweet and heavy feeling for me, but my husband loved it.<br /><br />I use a Magic Bullet...load the cup with ice and WATER (yes, just water) to 1 inch from top, add my two scoops of Click, and blend.  If it's a special day, a dash of caramel sugar free syrup or spritz of whipped cream.  Seriously, everyone thinks I've got Starbucks.  It keeps me full until lunch!  If I'm feeling especially snackish in the evening, I'll have another to feel full until bedtime.  Seriously, sweet and satisfying for this few calories????  It can't be beat!!!

review/summary: Really Yummy...taste like the "mocha java lite frappucino"  that I get at Starbucks
review/text: This was surprisingly nummsy. I followed the directions (first for the larger quantity of water) and was less than thrilled. Then I did it with the lower recommended amount of water and it was great. Try the lower amount first. And ice. Shake well.<br /><br />I shook it in a blender ball bottle for the 60 seconds...and I had no powder blobs or residue. It was really delicious. Nice smell. Very chocolatey. The espresso portion is very coffee-ey, but it does have that "instant coffee" sort of taste.<br /><br />If you like mocha javas, this is a really good protein shake to try. It's got some nice nutritionals. I'm not happy about the fructose (I'll admit it, I'd rather have sucralose and not deal with fructose or sucrose), but I'm happy to add this to my protein shake snack arsenal that keeps my hunger at bay between meals and that I can use pre and post workouts.<br /><br />Really  yum!

I drink CLICK as a recovery drink after my training runs, as well as on my rest days for a pick-me-up in the morning. CLICK has a great taste, not the chalky taste you get from most protein drinks.

review/summary: The only protein drink II make sure I don't run out of!
review/text: I LOVE my CLICK in the morning... I buy both and I have both on subscription orders through Amazon --I can't run out!  My day just doesn't start out right unless I "click" first!  I have been drinking the Mocha flavor for the past year and couldn't wait for the vanilla to be released, I just knew I was going to love it.  I was right, it's yummy! I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.  I love the smell of the vanilla when you open the canister, but thankfully it does NOT have an overpowering sweet vanilla taste to it.  I actually prefer my Click Vanilla Latte to the "[...]" v. latte--it's great.  I am so thankful for both Click products, it helps me get my daily protein requirements each day, it has helped me reach my weight loss goals, and it gives me a little kick of energy in the afternoons when I need it and I don't know what I would do without it to start my mornings.  Do yourself a favor and Click!<br /><br />p.s. I wish Amazon sold the "CLICK" shaker cup --it's my favorite shaker cup too but I don't want to pay the S & H to get another one -that makes it too expensive!  Although if I lost mine I would probably break down and buy it anyway...

I use 1 1/2 scoops of Click and a full scoop of a GNC brand of plain chocolate protein powder.  I have frappucinos 2-3 times a week in the morning.  The caffeine really boosts my energy. I can tell the difference in energy/hyperness between the days I have Click and don't have it. I was hesitant to buy this at first because I don't like coffee, but it's just perfect the way I make it!  I've had Gastric Bypass surgery which is one reason I need to get in my protein. This is an easy and tasty way to do it.  I'm going to sign up for Amazon's automatic shipment soon so I can get it cheaper and keep it coming. Don't want to be without it.

review/summary: Best protein drink ever!
review/text: I have tried many (and I do mean many) protein drinks and I must say that CLICK is far above any of the others. What's not to like? Mixes quickly and easily (a common flaw with other powdered protein drinks). Low calories (120). Zero saturated fat. Negligible sodium (105mg). Low carbs (12g). Decent protein (15g). All of this with a 31g/2 scoop serving.  And, most importantly, superb taste PLUS a caffeine kick for workout momentum. You just cannot lose with CLICK, whether it's the Mocha or newest Vanilla Latte flavor. I must sound like a sales rep for this product, but in reality, I am just a regular guy at the gym who enjoys lifting weights and fat-burn cardio. I simply do not have enough superlatives to describe how much I like and enjoy this one-drink-does-it-all product. As far as I'm concerned, it is not only the best of the best, but the only protein drink I need or will ever want!

review/summary: And I don't even like Vanilla . . .
review/text: I don't like vanilla as a stand alone flavor. Usually, it is just a pale imitation of the rich smoothness of a real vanilla bean.  I have been loving on the Mocha Espresso flavor CLICK for at least a year now and was excited at the thought of another flavor.  I didn't think Vanilla Latte could measure up to the Mocha and boy, was I wrong.  The vanilla is a sweet smooth flavor with a hint of caramel in the background. It is not the cloying fake vanilla and sweetness overload I have experienced with other vanilla flavored proteins.  It dissolves perfectly, has caffeine, and doesn't have that offensive sour protein shake smell, either.  Mocha Espresso and Vanilla Latte are a winning twosome and I look forward to enjoying them both for a very long time.

review/summary: My &lt;3 goes Clicky Click with Vanilla
review/text: I be so clickin'!! Just moments ago, a knock at my door, my heart skips a beat - my order of the New Vanilla Click JUST ARRIVED.  I prefer to make it with a cup of milk, 1 scoop of click (half serving) shake and drink.<br /><br /> Oh so good - but lets doctor it some more to see what taste sensation I can create.  So I added  1 click scoop, 1 cup milk, (some plain vanilla whey protein to increase my protein intake and keep sugars stabilized longer)  then a 1/2 cup of my decaf espresso cold brewed coffee I keep handy in the fridge, a couple of ice cubes, shake some more. OH - it was heavenly.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the mocha - however typically I'm more of a coffee flavor girl, and pure vanilla go together better on my palette.  I love chocolate, love coffee - together not so much my thing. The Mocha Click though works well together, and I have enjoyed it but wished for a more coffee flavor Click.<br /><br />The vanilla click is just that  - it's a richer coffee flavor, stronger but in a good way. For me I find the vanilla click is just smoother - in taste.<br /><br />Now my heart goes clicky Click every single morning.

review/summary: Lovin the Vanilla Latte
review/text: I usually drink the Mocha Click and it is my morning ritual I love it.  Well I have so patiently waited for a new flavor to arrive tonight I had one for Dinner and it was so Yummy.  I can't wait to start putting bananas, Raspberries and other fresh fruits to ad a wonderful variety to my morning routines.  I love the Click product we are going to Cancun for Vacation in May and I already ordered my travel Mocha packets so I would have them.  I can't do a morning with out my click and my CO-Workers will vouch for that.  Thank you for a wonderful product it is unlike any other protein drink I have tried and I am in Love with it.

review/summary: Clean your house - your whole house.
review/text: I've been using Click off and on since I had RNY surgery on March 4 2009. Think I had my first shake sometime in April. I started out with 1 scoop because I really noticed the coffee buzz. Now I have the shake about 3-4 times a week usually in the morning. Mixed with water, ice, and a little sugar free syrup is my favorite way to have it. I was glad to get set up on autoship because of the price break. My husband loves this shake too and makes a double batch for us so we can start the morning off with a lot of energy. I've not yet tried the vanilla but am looking forward to that. If you like coffee, chocolate, and need protein - click is a good choice. I love how this stuff tastes!

review/text: This is seriously the best tasting protein drink I have had, hands down (and I have tried a LOT of them).  I can't recommend it enough.  It's got a very nice strong coffee flavor (if it's too strong for you, just add more water or milk) and gives a nice little caffeine punch - great alternative to the vending machine for the afternoon blahs.  The Blender Bottle makes it perfectly.  Having tried a single serve sample, I am now buying two canisters...one to keep at home, and one to keep in my desk at work.

CLICK is the best morning additive for my diet.  It is not only rich in protein and low in calories, but it is also very delicious.  I compare it to a Starbucks mocha latte.  I even added a little cinnamon and made it a cinnamon mocha latte.  I've been drinking this in the mornings instead of breakfast.  I highly recommend this beverage to other GB patients and others that like an added boost in the morning.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I've tried a lot of protein shakes and this one tastes great! I put it in the blender with ice, water and a little soy milk and whip it up. Provides a much needed boost after a workout or as a midafternoon drink at work.  I highly recommend trying this. I'm on my fourth cannister now. Another bonus is it has helped me cut my calories so I've dropped a few pounds:)

review/summary: non refundable-waste of money and scam
review/text: I was happy to find a high protein chocolate beverage that I could take to work every morning instead of coffee.  I ordered 2 cans.  It arrived on time.  I followed direction to prepare a cup of chocolate.  The powder was very hard to dissolve.  After I worked on it using an electric mixer (since manual mixing failed, I thought to myself that is great, I can do that, no problem.  Time to taste the drink.  It tasted horrible.  The sweetness is artificial and chemical.  So I turned to the label to read ingredients.  Far from being all natural.  I dumped the drink in the sink and I was amazed that all the protein was at the bottom of the cup.  I went on line to return the product.  I was shocked to find out it was not returnable.  So I decided to write this review to help others not fall in the same trap.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.

review/summary: Turns into plastic
review/text: Bought vanilla and chocolate for myself and daughter since so many good reviews.  It was so bad we could not get it down.  Tried adding milk etc, hot or cold. Could not do it.  Took it to work, no one there would drink it either.  We made some in a french press coffee pot trying to get rid of chunks that do not mix in even with blender.  Left it  over the weekend and Monday when we went to clean it the product had seperated. Into three different colored layers, all solid with texture of styrofoam and the smell was beyond words. Scary to think of it turning to a solid form and forming bowel obstruction. Would rate it lower than one star if I could.

review/summary: Not great
review/text: This shake tasted decent if warmed up however I was hungry after 3-4 hours, other shakes I have tried lasted longer. Mixing with milk was better than water and definitely mix before heating up, it would not mix at all if you just add hot water. I didn't quite get the energy boost that other reviews provided, definitely more of a morning drink with breakfast not a breakfast replacement.

review/summary: Better off making your own blend.
review/text: I really wanted to like this one-stop-shop for my morning run out the door. However, the taste is getting in the way. I prefer making a similar mixture with a packet of Instant Breakfast mix (no sugar), a half packet of Via (your choice of brew) and a half scoop of premium Chocolate or Vanilla Whey protein powder. You end up with something better tasting, higher in protein and lighter on the e-wallet.

review/text: Do not expect the vanilla latte. This taste more like super old expired cocoa mixed with flour. Powder IS IMPOSSIBLE to mix thoroughly with hot or cold water, no matter how hard I try it still leaves the chunks behind. Taste is so gross, that it made me want to vomit when I tasted it first time. DO NOT BUY. I just wasted my money on a product that will not be even refunded.

review/text: This stuff was just a mess of clumpy bad tasting muck in my cup. Plus if you read the ingredients you will see sucralose is an ingredient. They claim "no artificial flavors but if you do a simple search on sucralose you will find in unbiased resources that it is in fact not natural and is made in a chemical process that of course can come with side effects; one of which being headaches which I get when I have artificial sweeteners. Just a heads up.

I do not want to get out the blender every time to make this stuff - it's supposed to be a quick, convenient, mess-free, mix-it-n-go deal . . . at least that was my goal. Oh well, moving on.

review/text: I tried the click espresso mocha flavor after reading all the rave review on the gastric bypass boards. I thought it would be great, I LOVE my mochas!! First I made it hot with just water (followed the directions to a 't' and measured everything out), horrible... terrible smell and taste, couldn't even drink it, I have to dump it down the sink. I thought, well... maybe I am just not preparing it right so I made a cold one.. yucky too. Blended with milk... a little better but still had a fake coffee flavor with tons of artificial sweetner and the funky protein taste. I've tried really hard to make it taste good to me but It's horrible in my opinion. I really really wanted it to be good... mocha and protein, it would have been so nice.

review/text: Urg.  This stuff was just nasty.  I made it with water.  Then I put the jar in the kitchen at my office hoping somebody would take it.  Maybe it would have been a little better with milk, but it still would have been a mess of undissolved clumps of bad-tasting stuff.  I have the Blender Bottle (the one with the little whisk-ball), and I shook it for a long time, and then I shook it some more, but it never dissolved.  Nevertheless, dissolved or not, I didn't like the taste.  Love Andrew Lessman's "Secure" protein drink, but that isn't available on Amazon.

review/text: Nothing--and I mean nothing--compares to Click. The creater of this product is a genius-espresso AND protein? And chocolate? Wow.<br /><br />Don't buy this expecting it to taste like a SBux iced mocha, cuz it really doesn't compare. However, for what it is (a bona fide protein shake) Click is a darn close second.<br /><br />I haven't tried it hot yet (you kidding me? It's 110 in the shade where I live!), but I mix it with cold water when I'm looking for "iced coffee" and skim milk/couple of ice cubes when I want a meal replacement (around 30 grams of protein/280 calories when made with 14oz of skim milk). It is tasty either way. Click mixes very well in those blender bottles (with the little metal whisk ball). I've never had issues with clumpy shakes.<br /><br />I am waiting on delivery of the new Vanilla Latte flavor, but I bet it's just as good.

review/summary: Bye-Bye, my local coffee shop...
review/text: My sister turned me on to this protein drink two weekends ago. I am an excessive coffee-drinker. It's my vice. I love espresso drinks and coffee. And spend far too much $ at my local coffee shop I have frequented for 10 years. Usually the first thing in the a.m. on my list is to brew a pot of coffee and mix a soy protein shake from GNC. But not here lately. Now first thing I do after my feet hit the floor is to pour 10 oz of milk into the handy shaker and mix 2 scoops of Click, shake it up and voila. It's delicious! (Did I mention I no longer brew coffee in the a.m.?)<br />Another important factor for me is that I don't eat meat. I am a Pescetarian. So, as a rule, I don't get enough protein in my diet. That's probably one of the reasons I drink so much coffee, is because my energy wanes during the day. I used to get a stomach ache daily that I just sort of got used to - was it too much coffee on an empty stomach or the soy in the protein shake from GNC?? Who knows.<br />What I do know is that today, for example, I drank two Click shakes back to back with my supplements I take every a.m. (Omega 3, multi, Acai, B complex...) and I feel great. No stomach ache, no jitters, energetic and content.<br />I would highly recommend this product. I've just ordered two more canisters! Enjoy!

review/text: This makes a excellent cup of iced coffee or frappuccino... (the hot coffee is ok too). Milk is already an ingredient, so just add water if you're watching carbs.  Also try one scoop Click and one scoop of your regular vanilla protein mix in the drink or frappuccino if you want a lighter taste and less carbs.<br /><br />I've used it in the morning when I don't have time to brew coffee (or eat) and have to run out the door. It's actually a good post- exercise recovery with the carbs and protein if you want to switch your mixes up.  Plus to me it's kind of like a guiltless pleasure for those days you just don't feel like downing a protein drink.<br /><br />At my house a McDonald's Frappe/Starbucks Frappuccino drinker and the kids both love it!

review/summary: Helps make the protein go down
review/text: I like the flavor of good coffee. I do not bother with coffee that is less than tasty.  Now when it comes to getting protein in, that has been a challenge.  Most protein powders have a terrible taste and smell to them making it less than desireable to drink.  With Click Mocha, I add it to a cup of milk, half cup of water, ice cubes into a blender shaker bottle with a scoop of protein powder (such as EAS or Syntrax Chocolate or vanilla) and one Click scoop of Click - two scoops is a serving.  Shake it up and go, this is my morning routine every single morning. And I do mean every single morning.  I am NOT a breakfast eater, so this helps me get some protein in and lasts me until I'm either ready to eat breakfast or lunch depending on the time.<br /><br />The coffee flavor is not strong in the mocha,  so I do add some instant decaf espresso ( I try to limit my caffine daily, if your not limiting your caffine then add leaded instant espresso) Bustello is my decaf instant espresso of choice and is more economical than Starbucks Decaf Via (Got a box of this for my birthday so I have tried using half a serving and still get AWESOME coffee flavor)<br /><br />If I just want a little afternoon pick up, I will use cold brewed coffee and add some milk and a half a scoop of click to make my iced coffee creamier.  Yes, there are many ways to make click - I prefer mine cold - shaken not stirred!

review/summary: Sorry, but I don't agree...
review/text: I have tried many protien drinks, and there are loads that I like - the taste, texture and mixability.  This one was spit out.  I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant. I did give it several tries - cold, luke warm, hot. Used a blender, a shaker cup, an immersion blender - all with the same taste and consistency results. Sorry to sound so negative, but I did felt the need to share my experience - as it differs so much from the norm!

review/summary: I'm in love!
review/text: I purchased this because of the reviews, the low calorie count per serving, the caffeine, and the protein.  I then decided against it but I couldn't cancel the order (I was a minute too late).  But I am SO GLAD I received the item.<br /><br />The Taste:<br />Imagine a Starbuck's Frappachino with added vitamins.  Yes, there's that vitamin taste, but that's the nature of shakes like this.<br /><br />The Caffeine:<br />I usually eat this with my lunch to give me the added boost I need to make it to my 530pm class and back home.  I tried having it for dinner one night.  Bad idea.  I was up until 3am.  Yes, there's plenty of caffeine in there but I won't drink it after 1pm.<br /><br />The fill-up factor:<br />Fiber is the best filler.  Protein is great with those who have to watch their glycemic level.  I developed gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with my twins and was borderline diabetic at one point.  I NEED protein in high amounts to keep my blood glucose levels at an even keel.  This works.  It staves hunger and has the fiber and protein to help me forget about being hungry for an hour or two.<br /><br />I would recommend this to those who are looking for a way to stave hunger or get caffeine with added vitamins and/or protein.<br /><br />I would also suggest getting a mixer bottle with the wire wisk ball.  Click makes one, but here on Amazon, you find find it a little cheaper (and free shipping if you do it right, either super saver or for Prime members like myself).<br /><br />Again, I highly recommend this and am about to do auto-ship!

review/summary: Tastes too fake/"metallic" is right on...
review/text: One of the 1 star reviews says there is sucralose and hence metallic? i didn't look at ingredients (i guess i will), but i agree that it doesn't have a good after-taste.<br />I really wanted to like this. I bought it, right? but i think it's just "meh". It tastes fake. I made it with milk to make it nice and creamy - consistency is fine; (i blend it in blender with ice).<br />I just finished mine and these few minutes later i still just think "i don't like it!"<br />Sooo... that's great that there are tons of 5 star reviews, but it's definitely not for the taste. :)<br />blech.<br />ETA - i came back after a week. it's not all THAT bad, it's just not as yummy and creamy as i would like. It seems like a large majority of the 5 star reviews are from weight-loss surgery patients? that might influence them b/c i guess they are limited by what they can have?<br />i will confess i actually look forward to my shake now -but i AM on a diet and i look forward to the caffeine also. I stand by the slightly metalic-y aftertaste. It's probably 3.5 stars. I LOVE My source of life energy shake. that's not chocolate though. that's the kind of drink i give FIVE stars!

review/summary: doesn't mix well
review/text: I read such great reviews of this stuff, so I decided to try it.  The flavor was good, but it doesn't mix well.  Getting clumps in your mouth is just so gross, I will not order this again.  Also seems quite over priced for the amount you get.

review/text: I'm always in a rush in the morning, getting a suit on and a toddler to preschool doesn't leave much time to eat. This shake fits nicely, easy to mix, tastes awesome, and gets me buzzing. I'm not satisfied through lunch, but that expected. Great product all in all, thinking I will add some additional protein tomorrow.

review/text: I was looking for something that would satisfy my iced mocha craving each morning but with a healthier twist.  Enter Click espresso drinks!  In place of my breakfast and iced coffee I now have a Click mocha espresso.  I make mine with half milk & half water.  I also bought a shaker cup to mix it & it works great, tastes great and is actually healthy!  I love it so much I signed up for the automatic delivery each month (2 canisters) where you save an additional 15% through Amazon :)

review/summary: Great Espresso Drink
review/text: I found this product a few years back, then lost it.  Thanks Amazon for having it available at a wonderful price.<br />If you like a mocha, chocolaty drink, then you will love this.  On the days where hot coffee is not what you want, this<br />will fill the bill perfectly.  I am a Weight Watcher and this is only three points, and well worth it.

review/summary: Warning-Highly Addictive!
review/text: First of all, I NEVER write reviews, and nope...I'm not an employee of their company either. But if I'm going to write a review about anything...CLICK is it. If you like coffee, strong coffee like Starbuck Coffee, you'll LOVE CLICK Mocha Double Cappuccino. It's strong, but without the choking bitterness of too strong coffee. CLICK makes a perfect morning wake up, and I've been a "gotta have a pot of coffee to wake-up" person for many years. CLICK is great! Two scoops, stir it around in your cup...zap it in the micro for 1 minute, stir again...another 30 seconds, and all done...simply perfect eye opener. I drink this first, while my pot of coffee is brewing, and within 15 minutes I'm human again. No guilt either, because this has 15 grams of protein and all your vitamins and good stuff to get you going. It's like one of those trendy 1 oz. power shots, but only better because it's also a meal replacement.<br />After buying two canisters at my physician's office for 24.00 apiece, 16.00 per canister (plus free shipping) when you buy from Amazon scheduled shipping, is quite a deal. That averages less than 1.25 per serving, far less expensive than a Starbucks daily, or even a local fast food coffee. That's my justification anyway...and I'm sticking to it :-)<br />Coffee and Chocolate...who could ask for more!<br />~Nonna-Deb

review/summary: My favorite morning drink - OH and it's healthy too
review/text: This stuff is so good that I would drink it even if I wasn't trying to lose weight.<br /><br />I started drinking it 18 months ago and have lost 116 lbs.  True, I have had to do other stuff also, like eat less and work out, to lose the weight, but I start every morning with Click.  It gives me the caffine shot I want and the Protein I need and it is yummy.<br /><br />I know that a few people have said that it was difficult to mix.  I use one of those mixing bottles with the little metal whirly ball in it and it mixes in seconds without any problems.  The final drink is rich and flavorfull and not at all thick.  It has that smooth creamy texture of a mocha latte.<br /><br />I have, on occasion, added sugar free vanilla flavoring, but usually I am in such a hurry that I just mix and drink.  It is the perfect breakfast for someone on a tight schedule.<br /><br />I recommend this to all of my friends and have even handed out samples.  Everyone thinks that a protein shake should taste "proteineee", but believe me, this one is great.<br /><br />[ ... ]

review/summary: For a great tasting Iced Caramel Latte...
review/text: I pour about a cup of Calorie Countdown into my Vitamix, 2 scoops of CLICK Mocha, about 2 ounces of sugar free Caramel (Torani brand)and about 6 ice cubes.  Blend this for about 30 seconds, pour it into my "Starbucks" plastic cup, top off with a little bit of sugar free whip cream and I could swear that this was just purchased from Starbucks, without suffering the ill consequences of fat or in my case, dumping syndrome, since I'm a gastric bypass patient.  Try it you won't regret it, even my husband who never purchases these drinks from Bucks or Dunkin, loves this imitation.  Doesn't hurt that you get added protein and a burst of energy.

review/text: This is the first protein shake I've ever had that tastes yummy.  I've tried lots of different protein shakes and have found some to be tolerable but this is one I can actually crave.<br /><br />I did take the suggestion of another viewer and mix it with milk instead of water and I've only purchased the Vanilla flavor but I'm ordering the mocha now.<br /><br />You won't be sorry for trying.

review/summary: click is my crack
review/text: I've been using this product for over a year now. Wouldn't do without it. The taste is great and I've consumed many types of protein drinks. The caffeine boost is perfect. Not enough to get jitters,but pushes you through a workout. Also, easily digests to be able to workout within 45 minutes of consuming.
