review/summary: Delicious!!
review/text: These noodles are wonderful!  Rinse well and they have absolutely no taste or odor. I've made them with Tomato Sauce and then with Olive Oil & Garlic, both ways they are delicious. They seem to absorb the flavor of whatever you put on them. Trust this fussy Italian, this "pasta" is really good. I just signed up for auto delivery, that's how much I've enjoyed them. Great for Diabetics, Weight Watchers-it's a free food, Gluten Free... you can't go wrong. Again, follow the directions and you will love this product!

review/summary: Learn How To Cook Them
review/text: First off, I read the other reviews here and elsewhere, and was worried about the much-talked about smell. Well, I got my order, and even sent a an order to my mother. The so-called smell was pretty mild. Once the noodles were thoroughly rinsed in a colander (preferably in hot water) they were just fine and ready to cook. Now, if you try making spaghetti, or any Italian dish, these noodles will fail you. They are not Italian pasta. They are made for soups, stir fries, and basically Asian cooking. In case the name didn't give it away - let me advise you that these noodles originated in Japan. I stir-fried these noodles with my own mix of vegetables  in minutes. They were awesome! This is the absolute best way to have them. Since April I've lost close to 50lbs by moving to a more vegetarian diet, and these noodles have made my meal planning even easier. I would strongly recommend them - but for people interested in making Asian pasta dishes (Lo Mein, Stir-fry, soups, etc).

review/summary: the "GAG ME" diet
review/text: Do not buy these!!!!<br />And if you think you can ignore all the negative reviews, just because you so sorely wanted a pasta substitute, you'll be extremely disappointed. What's amazing is that even many of the 4 and 5 star reviewers admit to the things tasting horrible. But still, because they're labeled as 'noodles', some people will maintain a willingness to force them down.....such is the lure  of Pasta!<br /> I suppose you could freeze fecal matter and sell it as ice cream and  some people would choose  to eat it if they desperately craved ice cream and wanted to believe the packaging.<br /><br />These are shaped like noodles.<br />All resemblance to any type of real noodle ends there.<br /><br />Horrible smell....as noted here,gags many people.Smells like a fish that rotted in a beaker of benzene<br />Horrible texture....like a scary foreign body in your food.<br />No flavor (beyond the obnoxious smell) They don't really absorb any flavor either. The sauce just coats the outside, and in eating, any  sauce  quickly departs the  noodle surface and you're left with this disgusting mass of  slimy rubber  worms in your mouth. Even well rinsed, the weird fishy smell remains in your olfactory memory throughout the meal, thereby  eliciting a constant, low order,  gag reflex as you try to chew these things.<br /><br />Somehow I pushed the order button twice...so I'll be throwing out $60 worth of 'food',. Not sure I want them in my garbage can. I may have to drive them straight to the local land fill.<br />I didn't expect greatness from a zero calorie noodle, but I really hoped these things would  at least be a palatable substitute.....not even close.<br /><br />Proving again; there's no such thing as a free lunch.

review/text: I purchased these noodles thinking they would be a good replacement for pasta.  I had hoped that I could recommend them to my weight loss clients.  Unfortunately things just did not work out.  First of all, the liquid they are packaged in smells horrible!  Does not set the stage for an appetizing meal.  The texture of the angel hair noodles which we tried was very rubbery. Even with my favorite marinara sauce, I just could not force down a full serving.  My feelings were echoed by the 3 other people in my office who tried them.  Even my husband who will eat almost anything, found the noodles unpleasant to eat and suggested that we NOT offer them to our clients.  If you have texture issues with food or you are buying them thinking they will replace pasta, forget it.  Despite the fact that we all eat a mostly vegetarian diet, these noodles gave us terrible gas, bloating and diarrhea the day after we ate them.  On a positive note, the company was very nice and allowed us to return unopened bags.

review/summary: No more noodles!
review/text: First, I never ever ever leave reviews on products.  I either like them or I don't, but I figure since I order them blindly, I have to only myself to blame if I don't care for it.  This, however, was EXTREME!  I saw the noodles on an episode of "The Talk" with a guest chef talking about how great they were..no carbs, no calories, great taste.  Wow!  I ordered 18 packages of the stuff without hesitation!  I was so excited, I even paid for the extra shipping cost to get it here faster!<br /><br />The product arrived on Thursday and I was so excited.  I called my husband at work to tell him we were having spaghetti with the Miracle Noodles!  Oh boy!!  Neither of us could wait!  I followed the directions carefully and was not surprised with the fish odor that I first noticed.  "It will go away after rinsing and blanching just like the chef said" I told myself and it pretty much did.  What killed us was the texture of those noodles.  One bite and we were both  like...maybe it will get better.  Second bite...maybe we can get used to it.  Third bite...down the garbage disposal it went!  Bleakkkk!  Too gross for words!  I am not even sure how to describe what it felt like biting into those noodles.  Some have said rubber bands, but I think that would be an improvement.  I also heard gummy bears, but this was nothing like gummy bears.<br /><br />I am only hoping now that since they are plant based, I can throw them outside---somewhere far from the house----to be of some benefit to my yard.

review/text: I see how these are supposed to take the place of normal noodles. They come no where close. I followed the directions for cooking, they are awful. I find you would have to put so much sauce and flavorings to cover up the chemical taste that you probably arent saving that many calories.<br />I tried it with spaghetti sauce, once w/ chicken and alfredo. I even did ranch dressing on a few. still Nasty. They are tough to bite and just taste weird.<br />I will stick with whole wheat pasta or a blend from now on. I would rather work on portion sizes than eat these. Absolutely horrible.

review/summary: The Secret to cooking Shirataki
review/text: When I discovered these noodles in 2006, I was really excited.  But, I had no idea how to cook them in a way that'd make me want to actually eat them.  The liquid they're packed in stinks, they have a very strange consistency, and they have no flavor.  It took me about a year to figure it out.<br /><br />Drain the noodles and rinse them really well.  Place them in a microwave safe bowl and microwave them (I use the potato setting).  After the first round, drain them in a colander and check the texture, do they still have water in the noodles?  If so, put them back into the microwave and zap them again.  This process removes all of the liquid, and gives the noodles an actual pasta texture and consistency.  And, it allows them to reabsorb whatever sauce you're pairing them with to give them flavor.<br /><br />Once they're ready, you can combine them with ingredients to throw in the oven for an amazing tuna casserole, or throw them into a reduced pasta sauce for an amazing dry spaghetti, or add them at the end of cooking a phad thai.

We drained it in a colander, then put it in a large bowl of water and swished twice, then drained it in a colander.<br />Then boiled it in water for one minute.  Put it back in colander and PATTED IT DRY so attached water would not dilute sauce.  Then COOKED IT in tomato SAUCE for 30 seconds.<br />It was slightly al dente.  It did not upset my stomach.<br /><br />Capitalized words are essential for success.

review/summary: Healthiest Noodles you can buy
review/text: I gave these noodles a try and although they are not the tastiest they still get the job done.  I am amazed at the nutrition label.  Calories?  Zero.  Total Fat?  None.  Cholestrol?  Absolutely not.  No sugars, no protein, no guilt.  I have been trying to lose weight for quite some time with different diets and these noodles are getting the job done.  They do have a scent when open but that goes away once you rinse under cold water as the cooking instructions states.  I wouldn't recommend eating these noodles by itself.  Instead, add to a pasta sauce, a salad dressing or soup and it'll taste fine.  They absorb the sauce very well.  Perhaps the best thing about them is they make you feel full after eating just one 7oz package.

review/summary: DO NOT waste your money
review/text: If something sounds too good to be true, it is. These Miracle Noodles (should be called Nasty Noodles) are exactly that. Although the fishy smells washes off with proper rinsing and boiling the texture of the noodles is nauseating. I was literally gagging as I tried to swallow them. When you chew them they break a part like some odd watery substance. I tried the noodles twice, two different ways (once stir-fried and the other in a soup) and both times I was absolutely repulsed by their texture. I ended up throwing the remaining 3 packs in the garbage. Miracle Noodles may have no calories, but they also have no place in my mouth. They were disgusting and I caution you all! Plus, you can find them in your local grocery store for much cheaper (they are called shirataki noodles)

review/summary: Miracle Noodle=WOW
review/text: I have used the noodle in several recipes and truly impressed with the versatility.<br />  I started with stir fry and was satisfied with the taste but found the leftovers fantastic.  The flavor of the sauce soaked into the noodle and wow.<br /><br />  I used them in a chicken Tetrazzini and again they took in the light flavor of the sauce and very satisfying.<br /><br />  The most appreciated (by my sister) was as an extention to spaghetti noodles.  She has been just been classed as Diabetic and a 1/2cup of pasta just does not look right so used the noodle as an extender.  I did soak the noodle in flavored water(powdered garlic,onion and water) while making the sauce just to bump the flavor and it worked very well.<br /><br />  So I guess you could say five stars is just fine with me.

review/summary: better than expected
review/text: Ok these things are pretty amazing if you are on a low carb diet and want the pasta "experience."  They are quite versatile.  WE have used them in Italian dishes, asian, and indian/thai.  They absorb flavor well, I think just as well as regular pasta.  The package of 6 angel hair bags is great, but I have to admit the bags are quite small.  Really an individual portion for most appetites.  The price I think was a bit high--17 per package--when I bought.  At 14 bucks/6pack its a better deal...just as good as you'll find at your local asian grocery.<br /><br />For you paleo types out there, it went well with "italian sauce" (ie, ground turkey sauteed with onions in tomato sauce).  But frankly it goes even better with Asian dishes.  Open bag, drain, run hot water over them, and throw in wok with a bit of oil and tamari.  add chicken or whatever you eat and its delicious.  Added them to coconut curry last night=amazing.  But the all time best was adding them into our Pho that we got from local restaurant.  We asked them to hold the noodles and give extra basil/bamboo shoots, etc.  they thought I was crazy, but its pretty darn good.<br /><br />I dont miss pasta at all.  These come a lot closer than other options like spaghetti squash. Get them!

review/summary: Great for me
review/text: I must say that for me these noodles are perfect. To be clear I am a guy(lazy, messy, tired after work etc who does not like to cook much and also was diagnosed with a gluten allergy).  I would highly recommend these noodles to anyone who trying to avoid gluten and at the same time those trying to lose some weight. They are an excellent source of fiber. I am not however a huge pasta guy so the taste or lack thereof is not a huge factor. I usually order from Amazon or asian food grocer online (Both are fine). FYI I eat these noodles nearly every day since they make good leftovers.<br /><br />How I prepare them:<br />Rinse them in a stainer under HOT water for two minutes(kills the smell)<br />Pasta sauce out of a jar brought to boil<br />Dump in the noodles.<br />I also add a few spices and grill up some chicken a few times a week.<br /><br />These noodles can be made in under 5 minutes as I just mix it with pasta sauce that I get from a jar. It is quick and lets face it 0 calories. Add some sauce and a piece of chicken and we are talking about a 200-250 calorie meal. There are some better ways to make these I am sure but I really just want something quick and low calorie. I hope this helps.

review/summary: HERE'S THE REAL SCOOP ON SHIRATAKI!!
review/text: Okay, so I heard about the amazing Shirataki noodle and decided to give it a try.  After MUCH research and deliberation I decided to try both the "miracle noodle" (zero calorie, glucomannan, no tofu) and the House Foods (40 calorie per bag, tofu and yam flour) varities.  BOTH arrived today, so I decided to try both and give an unbiased review.<br />#1 - Anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive odor, has never eaten fish before.<br />#2 - anyone who says these noodles have a repulsive texture, has never eaten ramen, or udon noodles before.<br /><br />I put a small pot of boiling water on the stove, brought to a boil.  Opened the bag, put noodles into a strainer, and rinsed 10-15 seconds under cold water.  Then I put the noodles in pot of boiling water.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the bag.. and yes.. it has a medium to mild "fishy" odor, nothing worse than salmon.  If you don't like this, then don't sniff the bag.  The "miracle noodle" had slightly less of this odor.<br /><br />I purposely sniffed the boiling water after about 1 minute, and yes, it had an odor, not so much fishy anymore, as almost plastic-y.. kind of hard to describe... again, don't sniff the steam if this bothers you.<br /><br />After 3 minutes of boiling (for the House foods brand), and 2 mintues (for the miracle noodle brand), I poured into the strainer again, and rinsed with HOT water for 10 seconds.  I then drained, and put back into the small pot, and added half a flavor packet from a pack of ramen noodles (chicken flavor).<br /><br />IT TASTED JUST LIKE RAMEN!  I was very excited.  The noodles (as other reviews state) have no flavor on their own, but take on asian flavors nicely.  As for being a "spaghetti substitute," these would probably do the same as if you put ramen noodles under some spaghetti sauce.. not quite right.. but not the fault of the noodles, just not the intent of an asian noodle.<br /><br />As for the texture, these noodles actually get FIRMER as you cook them, instead of softer (like regular noodles).  If your're a fan of "al dente" pasta, then this is for you.  YES &lt; they are a bit firm, but not hard like rubber bands (like other reviews have said).  And not slimy in the slightest, I don't get why people have said this (again, felt just like ramen noodles in my mouth).  I love al dente pasta myself, and found the texture preferable to normal ramen noodles.  The "miracle noodle" is slightly firmer, and more transluscent (like more tradition ramen noodles).<br /><br />I ate one bag of each, and loved every bite of both.  This was also about 4 hours ago, and I felt full this whole time (not uncomfortably full, just not hungry).<br /><br />I'm VERY glad I took a chance on this.  Perhaps if you have a picky pallet, this isn't for you.  But if you like Ramen noodles, then I'm telling you give these a try.  One bag (of either) is about the same volume as one packet of Ramen noodles, but at a fraction of the calories (or zero in the case of miracle noodles).  I plan on experimenting with other spices, such as bullion, and asian "flavor packets" found at the grocery store.<br /><br />Hope this helps!!

review/summary: Fishy and satisfying
review/text: So I bought these for my wife because she is into fitness and had heard about these noodles from people she works out with. Apparently they are zero calorie fillers and make it easier when cutting to lower your carb intake. When she opened the bag, there was a definite hint of fishiness. I was skeptical that they would be good, but she cooked them up and added a decent sauce and I couldn't really taste anything awry. I can't really say they are good or bad tasting, because they pretty much take on the flavor of whatever you eat them with. They were pretty satisfying and made me feel full for quite a while. I guess they are just fiber. Overall, I find them to be a bit expensive as a means of taking in zero calories. If I want to do that in the future I will just eat less. If I were a weaker person, however, that needs to feel full all the time, these might be a great solution.

I would rather go without the pasta than ever eat one noodle let alone a serving of these again. Just nasty, at least they were cheap enough for me to not care.

I was raised on 'scratch' cooking,might be a personal issue.<br /><br />Reporting back: I used a new pair of scissors and cut noodles up in 1/2 inch pieces. The solution is to swallow the bits w/o chewing. I couldn't throw product on compost heap as I believe the MIRACLE noodle would not break down.<br /><br /> The Miracle in the product name is-if you can get them down without the noodles wrapping around your tonsils,it's a miracle. My father said a hungry man will eat anything,if he is hungry enough/ first time my father was wrong. I also have a sneaking feeling that there might be paid reviewers for this company. Also, I haven't watched a Doctor Oz show since.

review/text: People who complain about smell need to read and educate themselves. Yes when you open it smells that's how they are packed. All you have to do is rinse, yes read instructions. Then i throw in a skillet for a bit usually with garlic and  seasoning because i did find hard to pat dry. If you throw in a skillet for a few it takes the step where you pat dry away. There is no smell. just eat however you want. Just don`t write negative comments if you don`t read the site or directions. The site alone will answer any questions quickly. M

It also smells weird. I thought it was too good to be true, and it is. It made me nervous to swallow, like how this nasty thing qualifies as edible food!

review/summary: Miracle Noodles Really Are!
review/text: I've bought Miracle Noodles for the past couple of years and aside from being thrilled I can now get them on auto-ship thru Amazon, I am beyond satisfied with them.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I don't have a lot of patience for whining.  When I introduce people (usually claiming they want to lose weight) to Miracle Noodles, I frequently hear concerns about the taste (since they are almost zero everything) or the fact that they come packed in water or whatever.  I usually dismiss those people and do not share my food with them because (1) it's not my job to convince them to lose weight or be healthy and (2) hey taste so darned good, I'm happy not to share.<br /><br />I've invented a few recipes and they are all delicious.  The noodles pick up the flavor of whatever you have cooked and they are super easy to prepare. The only downside might be (and it's a very small might), is that they require plenty of running water to prepare but as I am a vegetarian, I already do more than my part to eliminate wasteful water use so I'm over it.<br /><br />These are AWESOME.  Enjoy.

review/summary: Not Pasta, But Not bad!
review/text: It definitely helps to try these out not expecting a perfect pasta replacement. These are way more like the noodles you find in instant cup soups. And yes they did have an odor when first opened, but nothing terrible, and it was gone after a few min. of washing them in cold water.<br /><br />Some have said they can't work as a substitute in spaghetti, and maybe that's true if you're expecting an exact replica for a flour based pasta spaghetti dish, but I did try it, and I was happy with the results. I followed the advice of rinsing them then patting them dry, I did 2 packages of them at once. While that was going on, I was boiling water. I am a stickler for calorie counting and portion control nowadays, so I pre-measure and freeze most of what I eat. I had a measured portion of low cal. spaghetti sauce in a ziplock bag I was heating up in the water, but put it in too soon, as the bag broke and I ended up with spaghetti sauced water. So I made use of the accident to flavor the noodles. I boiled some pearl onions in the spaghetti sauced water, then added the noodles. Let that all cook for about 7min then heated up a second pouch of spaghetti sauce. I strained the noodles, put them in a bowl with the onions and now heated sauce and added some diced tomatoes and a couple shots of hot sauce. I wanted the tomatoes to cook a bit so I further nuked the lot for a few min in the microwave. Then topped it with a slice of fat free american cheese. It was actually pretty good. The noodles were on the chewy side, but not in a bad way. And they do soak up whatever you flavor them with. So as long as that part is good, the whole dish should be good. I think with these noodles anything spicy will work best. Which is why I added the hot sauce, something I wouldn't do with reg. pasta. I'll probably try a hot asian dish next.<br />But it's really nice to know I can eat twice the amount of the low cal/carb pasta I have been using which was 175cal a serving, and actually cut the calories of the dish down to basically just the 40cal in the sauce and 25 cal in the cheese!!!

review/text: I was so excited to receive this item.  STAY away!  I opened a package and followed the instructions.  I rinsed thoroughly in a collandar.  They stink of fish.  Ok, I like fish so I ignored it.  I plunged into boiling water for the time specified on the instructions.  I was getting excited.  Put them in a bowl with some plain homemade low fat, no salt marinara.  Sat down with my new found treasure.  Twirled up a fork full, put it in my mouth, chewed well but the texture was just nasty.  I swallowed, ignoring my gag reflex.  Picked up my dish and dumped it in the trash.  The rest of the unused packages followed them to the landfill.  They are expensive and I felt like I had been totally ripped off because of the price.  Dont waste your money!

review/summary: What Were They Thinking????
review/text: What were they thinking? Not the makers of Miracle Noodles, but the people who rated Miracle Noodles anything less than 5 stars! You are not a real 'pastaholic' on a low-carb diet if you don't LOVE the satisfaction Miracle Noodles give you. Yes they smell fishy when you open the bag, but as EVERYBODY has told you, that smell goes away after you rinse and boil. And there is NO fishy taste whatsoever. The Fettucini noodles are my favorite even though the Angel Hair is the best seller. I love how substantial the Fettucini noodles are and how their shape helps sauces hold on. I'm finding myself eating about 1 bag a day (I put anything and everything on them just to satisfy that carb craving), so I'll probably join the automatic shipment program so I'll never be out of them! See [...] for more information on the recurring orders program.

review/text: These honestly taste like absolutely nothing. I have no issue with the texture or flavor. Yes, they smell a bit fishy coming out of the bag, but rinsing (for a while) in cold water cleans them off and leaves you with a completely blank canvas for whatever dish you're making. I just used them with spaghetti and honestly thought they were fantastic. They more closely resemble ramen noodles, but seriously, for the health of these noodles, it makes next to no difference - especially when the alternative is having no noodles at all. In addition, they were extremely filling. Just follow the instructions left by other reviewers and you'll have no problem at all (the secret is a good rinse!)

It may have no calories and be healthy for you because it's fiber but why didn't anyone warn buyer's about the SMELL!  I had to hold my nose to taste it!  Needless to say, it went in the trash can.  Hubby came home and wanted to know what stunk in the kitchen.  Had to take the trash outside to the can it was so bad.<br /><br />I swear I'm not exagerating!  I write reviews on good things all the time but felt compelled to write this one.  Keep in mind, it's my opinion so you can try a bag for yourself and see if I'm right or wrong.  I followed the instructions as written just so you know. I won't be having a "Miracle" in my home again.

review/summary: Caveat
review/text: I must say up front I have not tried these noodles.  I ordered them and, when they arrived, I opened the box to find bags of white, squigly things suspended in a clear fluid (water).  It looked like something I would order from an elementary science teacher's supply catalog.  So I set it on my counter and spent a week trying to get past the way they look.  I visited the web site again.  I read the -good- reviews.  But the bottom line, for me, is that they look repulsive.  On day 7, they went into the trash.  I have a similar issue with Barilla Plus.  I think they taste fine, but they look very unappetizing to me after they are cooked.  If you are trying to find a good noodle (pasta) alternative, try Dreamfields.  It's real pasta; it tastes like real pasta; it looks like pasta; it's good quality pasta. But it has a higher fiber content, which makes it more filling and lowers the glycemic index.  You'll never know you're not eating regular old pasta.

But I was running out of options, I needed a miracle.<br /><br />You see, ever since my wife left me for the door greeter at Wal-Mart, my life has been a mess. I fell into a deep depression and began drinking heavily. This habit spiraled out of control and after getting drunk and crashing my car, I was jailed for 90 days. This led to being fired from my job. Since I was incarcerated and my wife had left, nobody was around to feed the dog. I came home to find him mostly decomposed on a grassless patch where my trailer used to be. Needless to say, things couldn't get much lower.<br /><br />I was now lonely, homeless, and starving. I needed a miracle. Thats when it clicked! I remembered that a couple weeks before I was jailed, I had ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLCEDE">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I rushed down to my post office box and BAM! there it was, staring back at me as if to say "things could be worse, at least you have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLCEDE">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />I quickly started a trash-can fire and heated up an old hubcap full of water from a recent storm that was teeming with what appeared to be mosquito larva. As the water came to a boil as per the instructions, I dumped the bag full of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLCEDE">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> into the steaming hubcap.<br /><br />The ground beneath me began to shake and the skies above parted. A beam of light shot through the clouds and illuminated a what at first appeared to be a bag of refuse, but upon closer inspection, it was FULL of aluminum cans!<br /><br />I quickly grabbed the scalding hubcap full of mosquito larvae and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CLCEDE">Miracle Noodle Shirataki Angel Hair Pasta, 7-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a> and downed it.

review/text: I just made my first dish with Miracle Noodles and I love them!  By themselves, they truly taste like nothing.  But, all I did was add a touch of butter, a bit of garlic powder, and few chunks of chicken breast and I had a pasta meal fit for queen!  YUM! I can only imagine the possibilities.<br /><br />I gave some to my hubby to eat, and he wanted more. He loves angel hair pasta and didn't even notice that these were a "different" kind of noodle.  It is filling, warm, and takes on the taste of what ever it is served with.  It has that satisfying toothiness of pasta that is cooked just barely beyond al dente.<br /><br />There are NO calories according to the nutritional informational.  So, for me, this is all the taste with none of the guilt.  We can have our pasta and eat it too.... just like that in that Meryl Streep movie, Defending Your Life.<br /><br />Cons:  The fishy smell before it is rinsed and cooked<br />  Preparation is a bit more intensive than regular pasta, but not bad<br />  Small packages (two very small pasta servings per package<br /><br />Pros:  Taste<br />  Texture<br />  no calories<br />  versatile<br />  can easily be passed off as "normal" pasta<br />  filling<br /><br />Overall.... this is a BIG FIVE!

review/text: Are you a big fan of Hot & Spicy "cup of noodle" products?  I am too and these are the perfect solution to avoid getting an entire day's worth of sodium and about 400 calories from a simple bowl of spicy soup.<br /><br />I take one package of the noodles and rinse them in cold water and put them in boiling water for a minute or so (basically following the directions on the package).  Then I soak it in chicken broth overnight in the fridge.  The following day I dice up some chicken and drain the bowl of the broth until there's the amount of liquid I prefer for my soup.  Add in some texas pete buffalo wing sauce (anything similar will do just fine) and mix it around and you have some delicious, guilt-free hot & spicy soup!  Just as filling as anything you'd get in a styrofoam container with a fraction of fat and salt!  Next time I'm going to drain the broth into a pot and bring it to a boil before re-adding the noodles and adding the hot sauce and an egg.

review/text: I was prepared for an awful smell when opening the bag based on the reviews. The water smells like fish, not a big deal to me. I rinsed the noodles for 2 minutes in hot water, then placed in boiling water for another 2-3 minutes. I then mixed the noodles with the sauce only from a popular Spicy Szechuan Style Vegetable & Chicken weight loss frozen food (softened it in the microwave, then cut the sauce from the noodles packaged with it). I put the noodles with the sauce in the fridge for 22 hours before eating them based on the suggestion of other reviews.<br /><br />The texture is.....strange. There is no food product on the market that I can 100% compare it to. They are rubbery and somewhat hard to break down with your teeth when you chew them.<br /><br />Marinating the noodles did not help, they were still flavorless, but it didn't matter very much because the sauce itself was spicy enough to mask the fact that the noodles had no flavor.<br /><br />I'd suggest the noodles to anyone trying to lose weight or cut down on carbs. They are not something I would want to eat otherwise.

review/text: They aren't really like spaghetti, more like a rice noodle.  Yes, they do smell bad at first.  There is nothing rubbery about the texture in my opinion.  I decided to try these to cut back on carbs.  I put milk in a pan and added butter, fresh garlic, and a little parmesan cheese.  Then I tossed the noodles in.  We really liked them.

review/summary: Couldn't get past the consistency
review/text: This product is supposed to help you manage your weight loss by allowing you to eat "noodles" without the carbs and calories in real pasta. The idea is that it fills you up with zero calories because it is made only from plant fiber. I was excited about the idea and didn't mind paying over $2.00 a bag since it's cheaper on Amazon than on the company website. When the noodles got here I followed the cooking directions and seasoned them using my favorite sauce. Then I took the first big bite. This was a mistake! The noodles have a slimey, rubbery texture that kind of pops when you bite into it. All I could imagine was that this is what eating worms must feel like. I managed to choke down the first bite and tried one more time just to be sure, but I just couldn't finish another bite. I was so disappointed. I guess maybe it's my fault for expecting these "noodles" to taste like real pasta. Now I have the other 5 bags just sitting in my pantry. I won't be buying these again.

Maybe it's the nice cool Fall weather creeping in and thoughts of warm soups and pasta dishes sound really good right now.<br /><br />I have ordered from Miracle Noodle directly and appreciate their newsletter that has great recipes and tips.<br /><br />I have to admit that the first time I received my Miracle Nooddles, not knowing anything about them, I thought I was sent a bag of worms - LOL!<br />Although it took some getting used to; I read various comments from other consumers on their website and took their suggestions.<br /><br />I mean really..the name Miracle Noodle is very appropo - no calories, or carbs and non-bloating - who wouldn't love that?<br /><br />A great way to get your pasta and 'eat it, too'.

review/summary: Hard to beat for 0 calories.
review/text: I found these noodles while searching on amazon for low carb bread/tortilla options. I went back on my keto diet a few weeks ago and did not realize pasta was even an option. They don't taste like the real thing, but that was expected from a 0 calorie gelatinous strand of soluble fiber.<br /><br />I only gave it four stars because it does not "easily absorb the flavors of any soup, dish, or sauce" if you follow the instructions on the bag. The first time I made these I followed the instructions on the bag and decided to cook with alfredo sauce.. big mistake, texture was horrible and could barely eat it.<br /><br />The best way to make these is in an asian dish, stir fry is great. After draining and boiling the noodles for a minute or so, take them out and put in a dry pan. Let them cook until they nice and shriveled up. Once most of the moisture is gone, add your ingredients. They will now soak up any sauce you put in the pan and not be so hard when you bite into them.

review/summary: Expensive diet!
review/text: It's not entirely obvious from the photos here on Amazon but these 7 ounce packages aren't like normal pasta, they're basically "precooked" noodles that are in bags filled with water so the actual quantity of noodles is maybe a small scoop per pricey bag. The noodles themselves have a texture that's (naturally) better suited to asian style noodle dishes (i.e. a ramen bowl) and upon initially opening the package there is definitely a vaguely fish-like scent-it's not a horrible pungent scent but more reminiscent of noodles just cooked in fish soup (really hard to describe to be honest). Thankfully this does go away nicely after rinsing and blanching per the instructions, and even when eaten with just red pasta sauce there weren't any weird flavors but the textures just didn't really feel at home here.<br />Honestly these noodles would feel most at home in making a low carb ramen noodle bowl or something similar, but the real reason I'm not going to buy these again is simply that the price is insane for the quantity you get.

review/summary: Taste and feel like bean sprouts
review/text: I'm really confused by the reviewers claiming they couldn't wash the smell off.  When first opened the bag smells EXACTLY like old edamame.  The fact that it smells like something that is also food helped me get past it a little. I put the noodles in a colander and ran hot water over them for less than a minute while tossing them around with my hands.  That removed the smell completely.  I think the assertion that they taste "rubbery" is a little strong.  There certainly chewy, but in the same way that bean sprouts or limp celery is chewy.  It's basically true that they take on the taste of your sauce, though, having prepared them in beef broth with hot sauce, it didn't really seem like they were absorbing the flavor so much as they were just coated in it.<br /><br />The only real criticism I have is that you really don't get all that much volume for your money.  A whole package makes slightly more than a brick of Top-Ramen soup--at 2.50 a package the calorie savings are really the only thing it has going for it.  For the same price, I could eat a whole ton of carrots or green beans, which I find way more satisfying and would be only a trifle more caloric.  I guess I figured shiritaki noodles would be better than carrots at answering my carb craving, but they're really not.  So ultimately, I liked the product, but I probably wouldn't buy again for price reasons.<br /><br />Also, and I'm not sure how this should influence buying decisions overall, but one of the bags popped and leaked its smelly juice all over the box in shipping.  To make matters worse, the noodles were part of an order that contained some electronics that were (thankfully) shrink wrapped.  Still, unpacking everything from a pool of shiritaki juice was nightmare.

review/summary: Much better than I expected
review/text: After reading the reviews I was a bit skeptical that these would be edible, but after trying them I think the bad reviews are based on an unfair expectation that these are a replacement for wheat/flour pasta.  These actually are a fairly good substitute for Asian style glass noodles and work well in stir fry and soup dishes.  After rinsing I tossed them into a stir fry pan with various veggies some spices and a bit of soy sauce and except for the slightly tougher texture the dish came out tasting like noodle take out from our local Chinese restaurant.  I wouldn't think they would hold up as well in a traditional spaghetti style dish but when prepared with a thinner sauce and left to cook long enough to absorb the other flavors of the dish they can be quite tasty.  One of the most filling meals I've had since trying to watch my calorie intake.

review/text: Yes, they stink - like rotting fish! You can rinse the smell away and add whatever you like, BUT the consistency of these noodles (I got the angel hair and prepared with my favorite homemade spaghetti sauce) is very rubbery. After smelling them initially, and then feeling as though I was chewing on tiny earthworms, I managed to down two forkfuls and threw the rest away. Color me crazy, but I'd rather have half a cup of real, delicious, high-carb pasta than a gallon of Miracle Noodles. What's that you said? Would I care for more Miracle Noodles? No, thanks, I'm having portion control.

review/summary: Love my crazy noodles!
review/text: I'm a gluten intolerant cook with a family of carb addicts; normally, I cook up a spaghetti squash for myself while they enjoy their whole wheat pasta. However, spaghetti squash takes up to an hour to cook, and I don't always have it on hand. I read about these noodles and decided to give it a shot. After all, you can cancel subscribe & save at any time, right?<br /><br />No way am I canceling S&S on this product; in fact, I upped my S&S schedule so I could make sure I always have some on hand. I don't use them for pasta dishes alone anymore - they're a staple in my Thai chicken soup, dry-roasted with chicken, sun-dried tomatoes and feta cheese; dry-roasted with garlic and parmesan for a quick lunch, etc.<br /><br />I have two ways of cooking it, depending on the meal: rinse thoroughly in colander, then cook for 1 minute in microwave with about 1/4 c. (homemade) chicken stock (good for spaghetti type meals) or dry-roasting (basically, rinse thoroughly and drain; heat a small skillet on med-high, then add drained noodles and cook, flipping noodles around, for about 3 minutes.

review/summary: These noodles are great!
review/text: I bought these noodles after reading the book "Wheat Belly" based on the author's recommendation. I was pleasantly surprised after making a Shirataki noodle stir fry. They don't really have a taste, but they take on the taste of whatever sauce they are in. The texture is similar to Ramen noodles and if you follow the directions on the package, they will not taste like fish even though they smell a little like fish when you first take them out of the package. (I was a little worried about that after reading some reviews.) You really can't go wrong with these noodles since they have no calories!

review/summary: Fantastic addition to stir-fry; delicious if you cook them right
review/text: I heard about these noodles years ago through Hungry Girl, although they weren't available in my area's grocery stores until just a couple of years ago.  When I learned 2 years ago that I am gluten-intolerant (borderline celiac), I started using rice pastas and the like, but they weren't all that satisfying and still had a ton of calories and simple carbs.  Remembering the stories I'd read about shirataki, I thought I should give them a try.  I had initially tried a different brand (one of the tofu varieties).  I must admit, the first few times I tried shirataki noodles, I was really unimpressed, but I was pretty much just rinsing them and adding them to whatever I was making, but once I learned how to properly cook them, even the other brand was really good.<br /><br />The best way to prepare them that I've found is a little bit involved, but they are still very quick and simple.  I put about a teaspoon of oil (grapeseed) in my 9" nonstick wok and preheat it on high.  I open the package of noodles directly into a colander, letting the liquid drain out (it smells a little like shrimp to me, but YMMV), and then open up the hot tap over them for a couple of minutes.  I then shake/squeeze out the excess water, sometimes blotting on some paper towels, then snip them with kitchen shears until they are a more manageable length on average (although sometimes I do this directly in the pan, just because I'm weird and that seems fun).  Transfer the noodles to the pan.  The oil should be hot and the noodles should sizzle when they hit the pan; grapeseed oil has a very high smoke point, which is why I prefer it for stir-frying.  I tend to use silicone-covered kitchen tongs for cooking my noodles, as it seems easier to grab them and turn them than trying to just stir.  I let them cook for a couple of minutes until they are more or less dry, then add my other ingredients in order of how long they take to cook.  You really can't overcook shirataki noodles (in my experience), though - they don't get soggy like wheat pasta.<br /><br />My favorite recipe is to add 6 oz. medium raw shrimp (usually I just rinse/thaw the shrimp and noodles together in the colander, then separate them as even raw shrimp doesn't take very long to cook), 1/2-3/4 cup of chopped green onion, 2-3 tsp of liquid aminos (or light soy sauce), a beaten egg or two, and a dash of ginger & garlic powder at the end.  The noodles take a back seat to whatever ingredients you add, and are just a nice addition that also tends to be very filling.  I calculated this recipe in a diet log, and it checks in at under 400 calories for what amounts to a HUGE bowl of noodles with 6 oz. of shrimp and two large eggs.  Tons of protein and very filling for very few calories.  Even my exceedingly picky husband likes them, and he isn't rummaging through the fridge & cupboards 10 minutes later like usual.  Last night I added some frozen grilled red & yellow peppers in place of the shrimp, and it was outstanding.<br /><br />I like these because they are not only gluten-free, but soy-free.  While I don't actively avoid all things soy, I do try to keep my intake in check, mostly because of how ubiquitous it is in nearly every other prepared food product (especially gluten-free).  I'm still curious about the nutrition measurements, considering the package describes them as being made of soluble fiber, but lists &lt;1g of fiber in a serving.  In any event, I am always full and happy after a meal containing these.

review/text: I have not eaten pasta in over six months, during which time I have steadily lost weight on the Dukan diet.  I kept reading about these "noodles" in the Dukan newsletter and now I finally tried them.  Found them to be versatile and delicious -- the flavor comes from whatever you mix them into.  Satisfying texture.  Easy to prepare, just be sure and rinse them thoroughly before you do anything else.  I found you don't have to blanch them in boiling water, which is what the package instructions say.  After rinsing, I simply soaked them in very hot tap water, then added them to my recipe.

review/summary: Pretty darn good for what it is
review/text: I first heard about this product perhaps six months ago, after reading a lukewarm review of it on a website. Out of sheer curiousity, I came to Amazon and discovered lots more lukewarm reviews, along with a few scathing and a few glowing ones. At the time I didn't have any particular need for zero carb pasta in my life, so I just kind of laughed at how goofy it was and forgot about it.<br /><br />That was then; this is now.<br /><br />I have since read several books and a myriad of articles in support of a low-carb diet for weight loss, improvements of blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and prevention/improvement of diabetes. For the sake of my own long-term health and vitality, I became convinced that a low-carb diet is my best chance. Of course the catch is that one cannot return to the normal American diet after the initial objectives have been achieved--it must become a life-long way of eating. In other words, bye-bye pasta, along with almost all my other favorite foods.<br /><br />But then I remembered the shirataki noodles and figured it was worth a try, even though my expectations were really low. I'm not sure how they make a pasta-like food product from nothing but water-soluble yam fiber, but they are remarkably like regular Asian glass noodles when prepared as directed on the package. Last night I fried up some meat in some peanut oil, threw in some frozen broccoli, added a bit of soy sauce and a little peanut butter, and then, after rinsing and boiling them, added the Miracle Noodles. Yum! As advertised, I found the noodles really didn't have a flavor of their own but took on the peanut and soy sauce flavors beautifully.<br /><br />They do stick together, so it requird a knife to cut off bite-sized pieces, but wow. Loved it!! And the addition of the Miracle Noodles also made the meal more filling than it would have been otherwise.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're low-carbing it like I am, you gotta try this.

I'm guessing they cooked them wrong.<br /><br />These have nearly zero flavor and are very thin and light.  They don't work well as a noodle substitute in foods where the noodle/pasta is supposed to be the main ingredient, like spaghetti and meatballs.  These noodles are good in thins like oriental cooking where meat and veggies are the main stars and you put them on top of noodles.  Great for Thai dishes with curries and coconut, giving just enough noodle feel to make it more satisfying but keep carbs at bay.

review/summary: GREAT AFTER A FEW RINSES!
review/text: I am currently on a No Carb diet and bought these noodles. I think the important note here is that you MUST rinse them at least 3 times before cooking them and then again after. They are shipped in a liquid filled bag (which doesn't smell too pleasant) and before I prepare them I rinse them at least 3 times and separate them with my hands under running water to make sure I rinsed off all of the liquid. They take a minute to cook and are basically flavorless. They soak up the flavor of whatever they are cooked in so I like to cook them in broth or salty water. After they are cooked, I drain them, rinse them again and then lay them out to drain some more on a towel. I know this sounds like a lot of work, but being able to enjoy a bowl of "pasta" after a long week is definitely worth the effort and there's no guilt afterwards! There are two servings per bag, but I eat both of them as they actually count as a vegetable serving. If you are used to angel hair sized pasta, this should be an easy adjustment. ENJOY!

review/summary: WOW :-)
review/text: I use a large variety of Asian noodles in my cooking.  This is the best one yet !  Was surprised to see them come packed in water.  The pre-boiling, and rinsing is very important.  While they are draining, I prepare the  rest of the ingredients for the meal, usually shitaki mushrooms, chopped green onions, grated carrot,garlic,<br />and Bokchoy or Napa cabbage for stir frying in chicken broth along with the noodles.<br /><br />For additional flavor, I add roasted Sesame seeds and low sodium soy sauce or a little chopped seaweed.  The meal is delicious and very filling.  Most of the time after a nice meal like that, you get a craving for another serving a few hours later.  Not this time.  Felt like I ate a giant meal that stayed with me all day.<br /><br />No cravings.  Day after, still felt full, could only eat a small meal.  Still had lots of energy.  When  you dump the noodles in the pot of boiling water, take a pair of scissors and cut the noodles into shorter lengths.  This will make it easier to serve and eat.  They are a lot longer than most of the other noodles on the market.<br /><br />Since the noodles are so filling for such a small amount, it's very deceptive, I am now adding a package of mung bean noodles to them, to add volume. You can't tell the difference in the taste or looks.  Just subscribed for a monthly order.

review/summary: Not a big fan
review/text: My husband and I are on Atkins and decided to try these "noodles".  I'd rather make "pasta" out of zucchini or some other veggie.  I prepped it as per the instructions.  I rinsed it longer than necessary, boiled it for a minute and then decided to pan fry it for good measure.  I made an alfredo sauce for it and tossed some in while in the pan since it's supposed to absorb flavors.  My husband took one bite and said no way.  He couldn't get past the texture.  I mixed it with the sauce and some grilled chicken, but had to stop eating it.  It made me gag after a while.  I tried so hard to like it, but just couldn't.  I'll wait a few weeks 'till I can have the low carb pasta.  This is totally not worth it.  Sadly, I ordered it from the Miracle Noodle site so I have several bags left.  I may try again, but most likely they will end up in the trash.

review/summary: AWESOME! These helped me lose over 100+ lbs in less than a year!
review/text: This is the year I vowed to lose 100 lbs. I did that and more and still going. I discovered these gems by accident through an ad online that boasted about a zero calorie noodle. I was suspicious. I read and researched it and put in my first order.<br />I rinsed them thoroughly and prepared my first meal with them using tomato sauce and eating them like spagetti. I was HOOKED! I eat these in several meals a week. I usually throw in some veggies, some low sodium soy sauce and a few ounces of protein and feel like I'm eating like a queen. They keep me full and I feel like I'm indulging. Ignore the negative reviews, honestly, I think these people are expecting the same old starchy heavy noodle they are used to eating with regular pasta. I haven't gone back to wanting or eating "regular" pasta since I started buying these! I even throw them in my Ninja blender to make the noodles very small and mix them with a fat free yogurt and some honey and it tastes like tapioca pudding. (after they are rinsed and patted as dry as possible with a paper towel) Miracle Noodle also makes a "rice" size that is perfect for adding to yogurt and enjoying like tapioca pudding.<br />The biggest secret is RINSE them and even boil them in water for a few minutes and it really does remove any fishy smell. My diet is a priority and I don't mind the couple of extra steps because the results really are amazing. I've also made a Vietnamese style Pho soup with these noodles. Very versatile. It's my secret weapon of weight loss!

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: After reading several reviews, I picked up a package of these at my local Whole Foods (didn't want to buy a 6 pack without trying them first).  I expected a weird texture and taste, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I did a lot of research on preparation, so I ended up rinsing the noodles for a couple of minutes, boiling them for about 5 minutes, and then pan-frying them until there was no more water coming out of them.  I tasted them at this point, and when people say they taste like nothing, they're right on.  The noodles basically taste like water shaped into pasta, which is fine by me because pasta is more of a vehicle for delicious sauce (in my mind).  I mixed these into some homemade alfredo sauce, and I didn't have any issues with texture, taste, or smell.  I actually thought the texture was very very similar to regular, slightly overcooked spaghetti. If I had it my way would they have a bit more of an al-dente texture?  Sure.  But given these have no carbs and no calories, absorb flavor well, make your meal feel more satisfying, and stand up to sauce much better than spaghetti squash, you'll hear no complaints from me!

review/summary: Packed in water, was a surprise.  Tasty.
review/text: It's not too widely mentioned that this product is packed in water that has to be rinsed away. So at over $2 a mugful, this is a very pricey noodle. But dieting is about dealing with denial for a longer term reward, and this product makes dieting feel like less of a sacrifice.<br /><br />Once prepared PROPERLY (follow the package instructions folks) and introduced into a tasty stir fry, it becomes (to my palate) almost indistinguishable from a 200 calorie serving of rice noodles.  I find it has a nice slightly chewy texture.  It's not alien or gummy as some have implied here.<br /><br />I don't think I would use this in Italian dishes, it's more reminiscent of glass noodles. I'm very happy for this pricey little miracle.<br /><br />UPDATE - I'm downgrading this to 3 stars.  A good product but I have since discovered kelp noodles and like them better. Kelp noodles are a much better value, and aren't packed in a briney liquid, and they are easier to prepare.

Thanks to reading all the detailed reviews I knew what to expect and how best to cook them.  My spaghetti was great and very filling.  I ate it before a very stressful night at a Christmas production dress rehearsal.  I stayed full and had no hunger or blood sugar drops well into the night.  I cooked them just as the package recommended (drain and rinse with cold water then parboil). After that I cooked them with the sauce for 2-3 minutes.  My whole bowl was 70 calories about 3 carbs.  Those calories are from 1/2 sauce and a 1/2 cup mushrooms.<br /><br />The next meal I did the first two steps on the package and then dry cooked them until they "squeaked" (saw that idea in a another review).  Then stir fried them for the last 2-3 minutes with chicken, spices, onion, garlic, and peppers.  Delicious!  I found the texture fine and the noodles take on the taste of whatever dish I have cooked them with.  As many other reviews said they do stink when you open the bag but that dissipates quickly when you rinse them.

review/text: There was a person who reviewed this product that said those who rated it 5 stars are exaggerating, and those who rated it 1 star are doing the same.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The noodles does smell fishy right out of the package, but rinse it under hot water for a minute and the smell will go away.  As far as the texture is concerned, it is exactly like the Filipino noodles that are made of mung beans called sotanghon.  It is NOT like eating cartilage.  It absorbs the flavor of whatever you are adding to it which makes them versatile.  The possibilities wiht what you can make out of them is endless.  The best thing about it is that it has zero calories, zero fat, zero sugar, and zero carbs.  Whoever invented this should get an award.

review/text: Fishy smell yes, weird texture yes. The smell really gets to me I have to hold my breath while im rinsing them. Then I boil them. And then put some light Alfredo sauce in them and the smell goes away. Texture is like they burst with water in your mouth... maybe im not patting them enough with paper towels.

review/summary: Definitely not Ramen but good enough for bodybuilding dieting.
review/text: I compete in bodybuilding and crave carbs while dieting. I can't have pasta so when I discovered these I thought I had hit the jackpot. Zero calories? Heck to the yeah!<br /><br />I tried these immediately when I received them and was disappointed at first. I tried following the instructions exactly and then mixing in different seasonings for flavor but nothing could get me over that gelatinous texture. I bought the 6 pack so I figured I'd change how I cooked them. I followed the directions again; rinsing and then blanching in boiling water. However, this time I threw them into a hot skillet after boiling and drove off some of the moisture for a dryer texture. I added in a random assortment of seasonings I had on hand and they ended up tasting like chicken flavored ramen noodles! I also tried boiling them in beef broth and throwing them in with some beef broth in the skillet. These definitely tasted and felt more like the ramen noodles I had been craving. I had definitely hit the jackpot with these. The only thing that could make them better for bodybuilding contest dieting is lowering the price.

review/summary: LOVE THESE!!
review/text: I purchased these after watching a youtube video of a woman using them to make spaghetti with ground turkey. WHen they arrived, I already anticipated the smell upon opening the package and the texture possible being "weird". Must say, I have already eaten all six packages in different ways but my favorite dish was the spaghetti.  When I opened the small bag, The smell was fishy but I allowed them to rinse while I chopped my veggies. The texture was very similar to noodles but more like an asian noodle (like the noodle used for pad woon sen or ramen noodles)They really soaked up the flavor of the sauces I used. I will be ordering my next shipment today! I am completely impressed and will probably use these for my spaghetti from now on!

review/summary: Excellent Zero Calorie Noodles!
review/text: These gems remind me of thai "glass" noodles, they're s bit stretchy and slightly chewy. Made in the USA, they're a great base for quick healthy meals, stir frys being my favorite. I stir-fry veggies, chicken base and cilantro, add protein (chicken or egg), microwave the noodles for 60 sec. and top them w/ stirfry.  Note these noodles aren't made of semolina, so don't expect them to be the same as semolina noodles. They do have a slight smell that I find it appealing, but other some reviewers have found it undesirable. Give them a try- they're a smart choice for anyone who's health and taste conscious. Unbelievable that these are ZERO calories!

review/text: From the other reviews, I expected these to stink up my kitchen. They didn't, there is just a bit of a fishy smell like you'd get if you opened a bag of frozen seafood. No big deal. They aren't like pasta noodles, they have the same kind of feel in my mouth as the seaweed salad I order at sushi restaurants. To prepare these, I dried them really well with paper towels (they come in a bag of water), then sprayed a pan with Pam and basically stir fried them with cilantro and soy sauce. For no calories, utterly fantastic!

review/text: I am from a generation which does not throw away food. But these noodles went in the trash.  Some of the 1 star reviews were correct in stating the texture as being the primary problem. This is a great way to ruin a good meal by using these noodles as a base. Rubbery describes them well. It's like your mouth does not know what to do with them. I don't gag easily, but this had me close. There are other ways to lose weight, which do not include this kind of food torture. They do not even deserve a single star. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Five star reviews - really?
review/text: I wasn't expecting a lot, but I do not understand the five star reviews.  When you are on a restricted calorie diet you will eat, and even enjoy, things which normally you would not care so much for, perhaps that is it.  Maybe some of the reviews are marketing plants by people who have a financial interest in the product sales, I do not know.  Perhaps some people do not find the rubbery texture offensive - I have friends who enjoy squid, octopus and eel - which I do not care for unless it is battered and deep fried.  With respect to the smell of this product, the strong fishy odor can be reduced to a light vinegary odor with proper rinsing.  The deal breaker for me was the rubbery texture.  I DID read the instructions, and other reviews, and recipes posted elsewhere.  Boiling for a minute, and even longer, did not improve the texture.  I tried drying them in a frying pan as one reviewer suggested, and that did not help.  I even tried frying them, but the best I could do was to take the "bounce" out of the rubbery texture to where they were merely tough and fibrous like the stringy strands in a celery stalk.  If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  I once tried zero calorie chocolate sauce, marshmallow creme, and even peanut spread, based on highly positive reviews posted on Amazon.  That stuff tasted like toxic waste to me, and unfortunately these "noodles" are just as inedible IMHO due to their texture.  There is an old Three Stooges short where they are trying to eat pancakes that accidentally had some glue (or something similar) mixed into the batter and this "pasta" immediately reminded me of those rubbery pancakes.  I do highly recommend this product to those who enjoy pulling April Fools Day pranks, as this would be perfect to serve to friends and family on April 1st.

review/summary: Delightfully surprised, DELICIOUS!!
review/text: I have never reviewed anything before but this deserves a special shout out. I saw something similar on Groupon but did not want a years supply, since I assumed they would be horrendous. I did not believe that something so low calorie, low carb could taste good. I went to Harris Teeter, where  they sell single servings, to try it out.<br /><br />The package does smell like fish right when you open it, as I was warned by other reviews. I ran the noodles (in a strainer) under cold water for a few minutes and the smell was gone. I put the noodles into boiling water (with a little salt) for 1.5 minutes then dried it with paper towels. I stir fried the noodles with some general tso sauce and cubed steak; YUMMMMM!!! It tastes absolutely delicious. It's a little more work than normal pasta, but very worth the end result. A little more chew factor than normal grocery store type pasta, but I actually like it better that way. Very similar to the consistency of pad thai.<br /><br />I would highly recommend these noodles as part of an asian dish. A lot of the negative reviews I have seen used Alfredo or marinara sauce. So if those kinds of dished did not work out for you, try it this way before you give up!

I did not boil the noodles like it says, i simply placed them in a stirfry pan in a little bit of oil and water until it was boiling and than added quarter pack of cheese from a kraft mac and cheese with some salt. Ate them just fine, consitancy is not bad, its not exactly like italian noodles more like japanese rice noodle. tasted delicious with the cheese, and its freakin zero carbs!

review/text: I think this Miracle Noodles brand smells less than others I've tried but your still have to really rinse them with cold water before cooking to get that fishy smell out. Throwing in some sauces and flavorings when you cook them helps too as they'll absorb the good flavors and the fishy smell will be gone. I think these noodles are a very healthy food and can be eaten even if you're not dieting. Once you prepare them correctly you'll find they work just as well as regular pasta noodles in recipes.

review/summary: Best Brand of Shirataki Noodles
review/text: I am a very picky eater with a very adept pallette, so I was a bit skeptical about the whole shiritaki thing, but I'm glad I gave them a try. I was very pleased with these noodles, I have had other Shirataki noodles before (can't remember the brand exactly) but these were much better. Don't be alarmed at the horrid smell when you open the pouch (I certainly was lol), that as I understand it, is the odor given off by the presearving agent, and has no affect on the taste of the noodle. Simply rinse them thoroughly in a collander until the smell is gone/extremely faint. Once boiled as instructed the smell will not be present in the noodle, and as I said the noodles do not taste like that smell. Miracle Noodles are completely flavorless and the texture of this brand is much more palatable than the other brand I tried. I think the Miracle noodles are akin to "Ramen" noodles as far as texture goes (this only applies to the angel hair variety, I have not tried other shapes). I had these with my homemade tomato sauce and they took on the flavor of the sauce entirely. I love them, I will deffinately be ordering them again. Pasta was the absolute hardest thing to give up when I switched to an ultra low carb lifestyle (over 2 years ago), and I am thrilled to finally find a substitute that fits into my diet! I would reccomend them to anyone on a low carb diet or just looking to lighten up their meals occasionally, great product!

They, however, make a nice addition to any sauce that you care to put them under to add bulk to your meal and substitute for high carb and calorie pasta.<br />Read the directions and prepare accordingly by boiling, then carefully draining or drying in a hot skillet.

review/text: Okay so I was searching for a pasta that I could use in low cal cooking. 0 calories per serving seemed amazing. Worth a shot. I knew by looking at it that it was going to be more like a rice noodle, so I was prepared for that.<br /><br />Now, be aware that if you're looking for something to replace spaghetti or something, this isn't the one... This is more like a rice noodle. Good for quick sautee with something... I wouldn't use it in a spaghetti sauce or an alfredo, really.<br />If you're looking for something to replace RAMEN noodles, this would be good... If you're looking for something to replace regular pasta? Forget it. Try Fiber Gormet or whatever it is. But if you're looking for a replacement for a rice noodle or something of that sort, this is a great product.<br /><br />They do smell horrible when you open the package Rinse it!<br />I used a little bit of lemon juice just to make sure the smell went away faster, and rinsed again, and it was perfect.<br />They have NO initial taste. (This is of course after the rinsing very well, i didn't taste until the smell was gone)<br /><br />Basically the most amazing thing about these miracle noodles is that they absorb the flavor of what you put on them instantly. A quick sautee with a brothy spicy sauce and it was like wow... Definately something I'll get again. Glad to have purchased it.

review/summary: Low Carb Pasta!!
review/text: I've switched to a low carb lifestyle and one of the most challenging things to eat is things that I would traditionally eat with rice or pasta... like mac and cheese or thai curry. For years I've been getting konnyaku noodles from the Asian grocer but I was happy when I found these as a I have a little more faith in their actual contents. The trick to shirataki/konnyaku is to let them sit in a flavor rich sauce so they absorb the flavor. Don't prepare them plain and expect them to taste good, cuz they won't. They don't really taste or smell fishy to anyone who actually knows what fish smells and tastes like, but they do have a different odor. Lately my favorite preparation is to parboil them, then soak in an Alfredo sauce prepared with Cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan. A ramen restaurant near me recently started giving the option of shirataki noodles in place of wheat noodles, so I've been meaning to try them as an instant ramen or instant udon replacement because they are awesome in ramen!! There are some really rich Korean stews that would do well with these in place of rice as well. Be creative and experiment, but most of all, keep your mind open!!

I let them sit in the soy sauce marinade for about 10 minutes before adding them. They totally soaked up the flavor of the sauce. They tasted like rice noodles would. Not sure I would try them in a traditional pasta dish but for Asian or Chinese style dishes I think they are great. Since they are filling and have no calories they are definitely magic in my book!!

I tried them plain and no taste at all then I reheated some chili I made for dinner last night and it came out great mixed in. I would recommend that you start out with a smaller or thinner product when first trying them. Just realized I did order the Angel hair but received fettuccini but will be keeping them anyway since I already ate some. They do have a weird texture but with anything new it will take some getting used to & it's not so weird you can't eat it. I saw others claiming it was like jello but it's more like a noodle not cooked completely.

I got the variety pack and tried the Angel hair today and the fettucine yesterday.<br /><br />Don't go into this expecting it to taste like Pasta. Think of it as a substitute for pasta. You have to get used to a lot of things when you switch to a healthier lifestyle. Skim milk instead of 2% for example, when you first try it, it tastes like white water, but later on as you adjust to it, you can taste it as milk. Sweet and Low doesn't taste exactly like sugar either, but it gets the job done in a cup of coffee or tea. Like those, Miracle Noodles is not going to be exactly pasta, any more than say, spaghetti squash is pasta.<br /><br />It doesn't taste bad, it doesn't taste like anything at all. Part of the pleasure of pasta is in tasting the noodles themselves, but this isn't going to be the case for you with Miracle Noodles. You will only taste the flavors of whatever you put on the noodles or whatever you put the noodles into.<br /><br />The texture is rubbery (not as bad as that 'instant jellyfish' I tried from the Asian market, but still rubbery). This is tolerable and I do think I can get used to this. Apparently there are some recipes or techniques for making them less rubbery, I haven't tried those yet. The noodles in my two times eating them have tended to stick together so I have to eat them in clumps. I think this may not be the case if I had them in soup though, but I'll be trying that soon.<br /><br />One thing that was immediately apparent after I ate them was that I had a full, satisfied feeling. It made me feel content and as if I had been well fed even though the only substantial calories had come from the sauce I had put on them. I don't really believe they're calorie free completely, so I log them as 3 calories in my diet log. Still, for the way they fill me up for so few calories, they really feel worth it.<br /><br />So if you want something that is a decent substitute for pasta, which may be something of an acquired taste, then this is for you. If you really care about losing weight you will try whatever interesting foods you need to try in order to do it. This is a way to fill up with very few calories.<br /><br />Even if you don't like it, I think using it once a day is a good option to help people lose weight. Even if you don't like it, just eat it anyway and you'll be full and not hungry anymore. That alone is worth the price. If you do like them, then that's a bonus.

review/summary: Pretty good....just a little different
review/text: After reading some of the reviews I knew what to expect when I received these:<br /><br />1. Shirataki's made of a Japanese yam-like root and packaged in fluid. Hence, they do have an unpleasantly fishy odor until you rinse them. I found that 10-15 seconds was not long enough. For me, it was like 30-45 seconds of rinsing. This is before you blanch them for a minute to cook them/heat them.<br />2. Know going into this purchase that the texture is less like pasta and more like asian glass noodles. So too is the appearance. I made pasta my first try at them and enjoyed their texture more when I liberally added Parmesan cheese to give them a little more texture.<br />3. These noodles have no flavor of their own. So, they need to be cooked inside of whatever flavor you want them to have.<br />4. I wouldn't take the negative comments as your own opinion without trying these for yourself at least one time. Since I have to have low carbs, these noodles are the second best to the real thing. That's why I gave it 4 stars....only because the texture was different than I'm craving.<br />5. These would be great in a spicey pad-thai stir fry with peanuts!<br /><br />Good luck!

review/summary: Perfect substitute for spaghetti noodles - you can't tell the difference!
review/text: These noodles are so wonderful.  They have the taste, texture and consistency of regular noodles but have no carbs, calories or fat!  I am very picky and these noodles are the closest thing to regular noodles and I am so impressed.  The only difference is that they have a more clear color than yellow.  I use them in a marinara sauce and they are wonderful.  They do smell bad when you open the bag.  You need to rinse them and boil them for a minute.  Then drain them and add them to your dish.  I don't ever taste anything bad - I look forward to my "mock spaghetti" meal once a week as I'm on a low carb diet.  These are helping me get through it easily.  I eat a bag once a week!

review/summary: Rubbery
review/text: THe noodles were very rubbery & the texture was not at all like food. You could bury it in sauce to make it taste like food, but cant get away from the rubbery texture. I do not recommend this product.

review/summary: Um wait this is actually enjoyable...
review/text: After a few attempts with shirataki noodles over the years (horrible every time), my expectations were not high for these.  However my jean size required I do something, so I ordered these.  They taste and smell NOTHING like the other noodles and they were so easy to use (I have only done asian foods so far).  They were also really filling, I completely expected to eat the whole bag in one go, but half a bag left me stuffed.<br /><br />I'm so impressed with these I'm ordering the rice now.<br /><br />Btw no these are NOT like proper pasta, if you want to be able to eat proper pasta to your heart's content taking up marathons, you will never find an exact replacement for it.

review/summary: Miracle Noodles -- Excellent
review/text: I have to admit that I was a little apprehensive about trying these because of a couple of the reviews here. One person even said they were disgusting and she had to throw them away.<br /><br />But I was pleasantly surprised to find that IMO these are excellent, and very easy to use. Just drain and rinse, make any Asian noodle dish from Vietnamese soup to Japanese stir fry, and they are wonderful!<br /><br />Once when I was lazy and didn't feel like going to a lot of effort, I just pan-roasted them, sprinkled on some grinder garlic pepper seasoning, and they were good even like that.<br /><br />There are a lot of recipes I found online that I would like to try. The possibilities are endless.<br /><br />I think I could eat these every day. And I just might.

review/summary: Great product, but kind of pricey
review/text: This is great because it doesn't have any calories. However, it is kinda of pricey for noodles. If you buy in size, you can get a better deal at online Asian stores.<br /><br />Edit: If you go to a local Asian grocery store they are super cheap. ~$1 per bag!

review/summary: Definitely worth trying
review/text: I was very apprehensive about trying this product given the mixed reviews, but I have to say I'm glad I did. So here's the skinny:<br /><br />- the product does have a kind of weird fishy smell when you first open the package. It says to run it under water for 10-15 seconds. That's not enough. I usually leave it under running water for about a minute, then its totally 100% smell free. The smell doesn't linger in the kitchen or leave traces on the strainer or anything like that<br /><br />- they recommend drying the noodles before use. I've tried them with or without drying, I see no difference.<br /><br />- you do have to let them sit in whatever sauce or whatever you're cooking them in so they can absorb the taste. I've read on some reviews that you shouldn't just boil them and add pasta sauce, but I've done that, and as long as you let them cook on the stove in the pasta sauce for a few minutes you should be good.<br /><br />Bottom line, for zero calories, they are definitely becoming a staple in my kitchen for those times that you're hungry late at night and need a bite, now I just boil these and use some sauce, and i'm full without the extra calories

review/text: I brought this last week and just opened one bag. As a lot of reviews mentioned, they smelled like bad fish when you first open them, but anyway, it didn't bother me that much after i rinsed them a few more times and cooked them in the boiled water for a longer time like 5 mins(this noodle/rice are great, they wont get sticky or mashy after a long time cooking).....As the information you can find online about this Shirataki food, it can help reducing carb and calories intake, increasing fiber, reducing cholesterol,promoting your digestive system,lots of advantages.....so far, i only had one bag and i am not sure how long it will take me to reach all the above good results, but the only thing i m sure for myself was that, it really help digesting!!! more amazing than drinking Honey everyday!!! b/c i felt stuffed and needed to go to bathroom rite after the meal. I just finished one bag, and i will keep eating them instead of the regular rice/noodle, i hope that<br />i will finally lose some weight and reach my target shape!!best wishes to me!!! and hope this would help anyone that wanna have a try on this product!!!:)
