review/summary: Superb when you can't take whey or even when you can
review/text: This product has 24g of protein per serving and is ideal for getting lean because it has only about 110 calories and practically no fat. The taste is fairly forgettable but not regrettable. If you need a pure bulk, as fast as you can, I recommend cyto-gainer but we all know whey is tough on the stomach of many people, including myself.<br /><br />There's been a lot of controversy regarding the high protein for muscle gain/weight loss and the jury seems to still be out. However, what I can say for sure (because Doctors and nutritionists have told me) is that more than 1g of protein per body weight is going to cause health issues over the long term. Also, the ideal ratio for carbos/fat/protein varies by body type and desired goal, the best way to learn is through trial and error. Personally, a diet relatively high in fat and protein works well for me, but that's only ideal for the short term.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product for either people who can't take whey or for those wanting to get lean. Pure egg is a purely brilliant idea...

review/summary: a tip for improving consistency
review/text: I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found.

review/summary: This is a great alternative to whey
review/text: I've been a fan of HnF's egg protein for a while now as whey bloats me and gives me indigestion (that being said, the ONLY whey I've found that doesn't bother my stomach at all is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BOTGTM">Optimum Nutrition 100% Platinum Hydro Whey Turbo Chocolate 1.75 Protein</a>).<br /><br />The chocolate tastes pretty good with water (although I don't really care about taste), and is actually pretty darn good with rice milk. It also tastes good in smoothies (I use frozen bananas and rice milk).<br /><br />Only downside is you may get gas initially and you're going to smell things that no human should smell. This passes pretty quickly (huhuh) though.<br /><br />Oh and don't buy the vanilla flavored powder because it tastes like soap. I use it in smoothies and it lends a little vanilla flavor but it's still not very good.

review/summary: tasty...but too sweet
review/text: compared to other egg proteins I have recently used, this one is very sweet.  It is sweetened with splenda, so still very low in actual sugar/carbs.  I prefer to use an unsweetened version and put fruit in the blender with it to naturally sweeten it, but my wife likes this one b/c its easy to instantize in milk (we use almond milk) with a spoon.  No blender required.

review/summary: Low calorie, high protein, great taste
review/text: I really like this protein drink. I'm pregnant and trying to increase protein in my diet without adding a whole lot of extra calories or fat. This is the perfect solution. I usually mix it with a combination of 1/2 plain almond milk and half water. I also usually add a little more liquid than it says in the directions, otherwise I find it too sweet. The nice thing is that it is sweetened with stevia instead of a calorie-filled sugar of some sort. I prefer egg protein to other proteins because soy is often GMO and not recommended in high doses in pregnancy (or for anyone actually), and whey protein is a dairy product, which I generally don't tolerate well. Egg protein is perfect for my needs.

review/summary: It's good once you doctor it up a little bit!
review/text: I use this as a whey/soy protein alternative. I am allergic to soy and have sensitivity to whey and this product seems to be free of both. I actually haven't used it as a shake, but I use it to make protein pancakes. I find I have to add extra cocoa powder to make it more chocolatey and stevia to make it more sweet. At first I came out with some really awful pancakes, but after I found the perfect ingredients to doctor it up, they all come out amazing!!! So if your looking for an alternative to whey and soy, I definitely think this is a good choice!

review/summary: The Best Protein Out There
review/text: In my opinion, this is the best protein powder out there.<br />I've used a lot of different protein products, from Dymatize to Optimum Nutrition (Gold Standard) and CellTech (MuscleTech), BSN, many others as well.  The reason that I tried this one is because I've been doing a lot of research, talking with my doctor and nutritionists regarding the subject of protein and protein suppliments in general.  The conclusion that I have come to is that the whey products are ok, but they are not the magic dust that everyone thinks it is.  Sure it is good, and the protein is not bad, but it can be better.<br />For those who have issues with dairy, whey is not an option.  Whey is a dairy product, and actually a bi-product of diary production.  Dairy is not the best choice of protein out there, many may disagree with this but it is a fact.  America has an infatuation with dairy and sweets.  If you look at any tables that show protein absorbtion effeciency in our bodies you will see this fact.  Eggs and Fish are rated at the top for best absorbtion and usage in the human body.  Eggs are around 88% effeciency, while fish is around 70% and chicken around 60%.  Whey and dairy are below all of these, this is precisely why whey is so cheap, and that is why it is so popular.  Sure the egg protein is going to be more expensive, but it is a better product.<br />As far as taste and texture, I find it just as good as the whey products that I have used, and even better then some.  I've tried some whey powders that were just aweful.  I have a 5lb tub of "Metabolic" whey that I tried, it is still sitting in the back room.

review/summary: Very good nutritionally, but expensive and clumpy
review/text: The Healthy 'n Fit egg protein is a very good product. It's almost all protein, the taste is good, you can cook with it (my favorites are oatmeal and Russian-style cottage cheese pancakes). And the price *used* to be great, even cheaper per ounce than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>. However, since I bought my first tub earlier this year, the price jumped significantly to more than the Optimum Nutrition chocolate-flavored egg protein, so I bought a 2-lb. tub of that. I found that while the ON protein has a little fat and more carbs in it, it was much easier to mix into liquids with fewer or no clumps, unlike the Healthy 'n Fit product. I also like the taste just fine. So I found that I enjoy my shakes with the ON more, and it's faster and easier to mix my oatmeal in the morning with the ON.<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong -- this is a great product. But I just don't think it warrants a higher price than the Optimum Nutrition protein.<br /><br />So, to recap, as compared to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIST86">Optimum Nutrition 100% Egg Protein, Rich Chocolate, 2 Pound</a>:<br />Pros:<br />Lower in carbs<br />Lower in fat<br /><br />Cons:<br />More expensive<br />Clumpier/harder to mix

review/summary: A Protein Powder to make you Gag.
review/text: I have tried many different protein powders over the years, and while it is hard to write a review based on taste alone (since everyone's taste is different), I'm going to go ahead and say this is the most rancid tasting gunk I have ever had the displeasure of putting in my mouth.<br /><br />I mix my protein shakes with a hand blender, so I rarely have any mixing problems - and even this protein mixed well.  The fun really began when I tasted it.  It tastes sour and acrid at the same time, absolutely horrendous.  I could not finish the shake I had mixed up, and had to wash my mouth out with apple juice to get that sick taste out before I could actually eat or drink anything else.<br /><br />This is a terrible protein powder from the standpoint of taste, in my opinion.  Of all the types I have tried, which is many, this has taken seat as the new "worst" one.<br /><br />FYI, I had ordered this with another brand because I am testing egg protein powders due to casein sensitivity.  If anyone has an egg protein powder recommendation, PM me.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product.

review/summary: Best Natural Protein
review/text: Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.

review/text: I like this product, and i agree with any post, who says it mixes well, i bought a sample case just to test the waters, and i dont feel bloated or anything after i drink it, i think i feel my body is responding to it very well, i am going to finish up the muscle milk protein because i bought it and i pay over 30 for it, lol, but when i finish up the other proteins i purchase, i am going to stick with egg white protein, since i dont like eating them, everyone taste buds is different, some may like it, some may dont, then depending on your body chemistry some responds well to egg whites, some dont, but as for me personally i like it so far, might try out the strawberry passion protein, but the vanilla kind taste very good, i would suggest this protein should be used for edurance athletes, or people who are into calistenics such as push ups and pull ups,

review/text: I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT TO TRY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR JAY ROBB EGG WHITE PROTEIN SHAKES, WHICH IS WHAT I PREFER BUT DOESN'T FIT MY BUDGET - TO EXPENSIVE FOR EVERY DAY USE.  I WAS LOOKING FOR AN ALTERNATIVE AND CAME ACROSS THIS.  SINCE ONE OF THE REVIEWS SAID THAT IT WAS SOY FREE I DECIDED TO TRY IT.  I DON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH THE TASTE WITH ALL OF MY HEALTH PROBLEMS OVER THE YEARS I HAVE LEARNED NOT TO EXPECT A LOT IN THAT DEPARTMENT.  IT JUST TASTE LIKE WATERED DOWN CHOCOLATE TO ME.  I DRINK IT WITH WATER OR SOMETIMES WITH RICE MILK BECAUSE I NEED THE EXTRA CALORIES ON DAYS THAT I CAN'T HANDLE SOLID FOODS.  HOWEVER,ON RECEIVING THE PRODUCT, IT DOES CONTAIN SOY. HOW MUCH I COULDN'T SAY AS IT WASN'T LISTED ON THE INGREDIGENT COLUMN.  I FOUND IT MENTIONED ON THE BACK OF THE LABEL STATING THAT IT CONTAINED SOY LETICHEN(THINK I SPELLED THAT RIGHT).  I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH.  IF SOMEONE COULD SHED SOME LIGHT ON THAT I WOULD APPRECIATE THE INFO. ALSO,I NOTICED THAT IT HAS GONE UP ABOUT $10.00 SINCE I PLACED MY ORDER LAST MONTH,SO IT MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE ANYMORE, BECAUSE THAT PUTS IT ABOUT EVEN WITH WHAT I WAS PAYING FOR THE JAY ROBB EGG WHITE SHAKES.

review/text: So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint.

review/text: This syrup is a graet value!<br /><br />The bigger more expensive coffee shops use this same syrup to flavor their coffee drinks, with "additional" expense to the consumer.<br /><br />Bottles are plastic instead of glass for easier shipping to consumer.<br /><br />Have these auto shipped to my home every three months.

review/summary: Torani Syrup, Classic Hazelnut
review/text: I bought it particularly for my wife who enjoys the flavored iced coffees when we are on ther road.  Now wnen we are home and she gets in the mood for an iced coffee with the hazelnut flavor....no problem.  I just make an extra amount of brewed coffee in the morning and put the extra in a bottle and place it in the frig. Then I use 1&1/2 ounces of Torani Syrup, 1&1/2 ounces of milk and fill the rest of the typical water glass with the chilled coffee.  My wife loves it, I do not have to drive out to the store and it is very cost effective.  I will definitely purchase more!

review/summary: How sweet it isn't
review/text: Most of the coffee houses I have been to use Torani syrup(s). And by coffee houses not the K-Cup or pump dispenser ones.<br /><br />Some Torani flavors are better then others but the Hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />This is the same high end stuff most coffee houses charge 50-75 cents for.<br />Just using one bottle of syrup will save you a small fortune.<br /><br />Some feel it tastes artificial. Just make sure you are not ordering the Sugar free variant, like diet anything, its pretty bad.<br /><br />And don't compare it to Starbucks. They use 5 or more pumps for what you would call a shot. The coffee is so muddy you would need that<br />much sugar syrup just to taste the sweet and not much flavor there at all.  If you like, you could get the same effect buy dumping in 5 bags of sugar and one teaspoon of Hazelnut syrup.<br /><br />The old bottles used to be made of glass but the plastic bottles are easier on the counter when dropped and haven't broken yet.<br />Out of the three pack I keep one in the office and one at home all the time. The third is a back up when one runs dry and before the next order can arrive.<br />A lot of enjoyment for less than a $20 bill.

review/text: This is a great product for those who love the sweet taste and aroma of classic hazelnut in their coffee. I assumed it contained corn syrup, but it isn't among the ingredients on the label. In fact, first ingredient is "pure cane sugar." It comes in sturdy plastic bottles (I'd prefer glass).

review/summary: Adds Depth, Flair, and Dimension to Your Coffee!
review/text: Torani, the flavored syrup often presumed to originate from Italy, but actually manufactured in South San Francisco ("The industrial City"--their motto, not mine) makes many delicious flavors, and hazelnut is one of my favorites.<br /><br />The hazelnut refers to any nuts from the species of the genus Corylus. While raw hazelnuts can have a bitter taste, their culinary uses are many, extending from common pralines and other candies (including "Nutella") to the rarified confections of Europe, such as the justly famous Viennese hazelnut torte. Hazelnut is no stranger to the coffee house scene, and when mixed with vodka, hazelnut liqueurs (Frangelica, most famoulsy) enjoy widespread popularity , both straight and as a topping. Even hazelnut butter is making a stand in the United States and Europe.<br /><br />ALl this is to say that adding hazelnut syrup to your coffee (especially) or perhaps to ice cream, can be vigorously defended against specious attack by foodies: It enjoys a widespread and international esteem. Torani'z hazelnut is a non-alcoholic sweetner whicih imparts discernable hazelnut flavor, and it can add a great deal of depth and flair to an otherwise ordinary coffee drink. It's not as sweet or one-dimensional as the Vanilla flavor, although a higher ratio of hazelnut to sugar would certainly improve the experience. It's relatively inexpensive, so that you can find your favorite flavors for various concoctions. A nice bright bottle, too, often left out for display purposes in the unpretensious bohemian caf&eacute;. There will be those black coffee drinkers, gloating over rejected poetry and stinking Galois, who will scorn the use of such a sweetener; it is perhaps best to leave then alone.

Amazon takes the work out of shopping for my favorite cereal and saves me a bundle too.  By the way, if you've got IBS with constipation this cereal plus Activa once a day REALLY makes a big difference.

With exception of Similac, which one of the kids did not seem to like, they can take any brand, so we mostly use Kirkland. I buy Bright Beginnings when it's available, and on sale (I bought it for $7, $5, but current $10 seems to be a decent price, too). The kids don't have a problem with it. I'm not sure if it's any better or worse than other brands, but since all manufacturers are supposed to follow the same FDA standards, I see no reason to overpay for a more recognized and overpriced brand.

review/summary: Can't Tell the Difference
review/text: Taste tested this brand against Heinz.  My son thought Organicville was Heinz and vice versa.  Hubby couldn't tell the difference.  I could tell the difference and named the ketchups correctly, but the difference is so minor that I didn't care.  The lower glycemic index of agave versus corn syrup is what makes me buy this product over Heinz.  Good ketch!

review/summary: Love this ketchup
review/text: The title says it.  I love this ketchup.  For years after using one sugar laden brand, I'm trying to cut down on the sugar in foods.  I use agave nectar as my sweetner for alot of things so was really surprised to see this ketchup.  It tastes great and I'm kind of a ketchup snob.  In our family we used to get teased "like a little hamburger with your ketchup" so you know I had to find one that tasted as good as the popular brand I was using.  Thanks for the product.

review/summary: Good Product
review/text: I really like the taste of this ketchup and I'm glad I found a ketchup that isn't made with corn syrup. My only problem was one bottle was damaged during shipping and leaked. Amazon issued a prompt refund for the damaged bottle, though. Amazon really needs to work on shipping methods. I order bottled products from other sites and have never had a problem because they take simple steps to ensure products are delivered intact, such as taping lids to bottles to prevent cap unscrewing and wrapping items in bubble wrap.

review/summary: The best non-HFCS organic ketchup out there!
review/text: Organicville is simply amazingly delicious ketchup. It is sweetened with agave which is much sweeter than sugar but better for you because of its low-glycemic index. I wanted to buy a 4-pack of Organicville Ketchup from Amazon.com hoping that it would be cheaper. It's not! It's a lot cheaper at my local supermarket!

review/summary: Tastes like Heinz!
review/text: I bought this ketchup at my local health food store since I've started a "Whole Foods" diet. I was afraid that it wasn't going to taste anything like our beloved Heinz ketchup since a lot of natural/ organic products don't taste as good as the stuff we're used to. Well luckily this tastes the same, maybe even better! I'm very happy I found it & have even shared it on my blog I like it so much. If you're looking for an alternative to the HFCS laden ketchup (which has HFCS & regular corn syrup!) this is it.

review/text: This Ketchup is wonderful!!! Tastes just like any "sugary" product on the market, but without the sugar and the calories. I purchased this when Amazon carried it as a Prime product. I am so sorry they have discontinued. The only replacement they have with Agave is a product from Mexico, where there is absolutely no oversite as to what is truly in the product, how the product was produced or the labor conditions with which it was produced. Come on Amazon, bring this one back....a USA produced and FDA regulated product!!

review/summary: Disappointed - it IS sweet
review/text: I ordered the ketchup on the basis of some of the other reviews that gave me the impression that it was UN-sweetened, since I've always thought most U.S. ketchups (and mustard, tartar sauce, baked beans, and coleslaw, for that matter! but don't get me started...) contain way too much sweetener.  When the ketchup arrived, however, I was disappointed to taste - and find that this was, IMHO, just as sweet as any other ketchup on the market.  The key is that, NO, there is no added sugar, no corn syrup - but the product uses agave as a natural sweetener.  So I would recommend this ketchup for people who want to avoid processed sugar and chemical sweeteners - but not for those individuals like me who bemoan the tendency of American food producers to pour sugar and/or corn syrup into anything they can get away with.

review/summary: Does it rate?
review/text: This is a ketchup I've been really looking forward to trying. Having read the reviews, here and elsewhere, there is pretty good agreement about its merits. Depending on where you look, some people concentrate on its similarity to Heinz, while others talk about how different it is. Here on Amazon, a lot of reviewers feel it's similar to Heinz, some even say it's the same. I expected it to be comparable. It isn't, except that both are good.<br /><br />The difference is in the taste and consistency. The taste of Heinz is much more aggressive than Organicville. You could say it has more zing or kick. I'd imagine its vinegar and sugar content is pretty high. The consistency of Heinz is thicker, and yet smoother, sort of like paint. The Organicville feels lighter, and looks "grainier", though it is smooth, of course. It looks more "natural", while Heinz has a processed, technicolor look.<br /><br />Neither is better than the other. They're two different animals. Having said that, I'm not sure I like the Organicville, at least on the hamburger I tested it on. I also tried it plain. So while I seemed to be enjoying the new and different taste and texture, and letting myself adjust to the more laid back material, by the last bit of my burger I wasn't dipping it in--and enjoyed that better.<br /><br />Rating the item is actually easier than I thought. One star means "I hate it", two stars means "I don't like it". I certainly don't hate it, and I wouldn't say I actively dislike it. Five stars means "I love it", four stars means "I like it". I don't love it and I really can't say I like it, leaving 3 stars or "It's OK". I think it's better than ok. But somehow, it doesn't grab me.

review/text: My two black labs love this, I mix the Eagle Pack in with their dry food and they eat like they are starving.  I was looking for canned dog food that I could order online and have delivered quickly.  Shipping was fast and I tried the Eagle Pack beef right away (before I had used up my other brand cans).  I found out about it on one of the dog food reviews that listed five star and down dog foods.  My dogs had been leaving food in their bowls and it wasn't like them so I started looking at reviews and ingredients and pricing.  This was one of the best for everything.  Doesn't matter what I think, my dogs love it and they look healthier! Another plus was that two of the flavors were Amazon Prime eligible.  Fast and convenient.

review/summary: Full of vitamins & minerals, made with ingredients I can actually pronounce
review/text: I'm allergic to soy protein, and it breaks me out terribly. I'm very glad to find a nut-based bar w/ a little chocolate that tastes (and is) natural. They are SO addictive. We have literally bought over fifty boxes of these in only four months! I never get tired of them. Fabulous post-workout food. You get crunchy, chewy, salty, sweet in perfect balance, with nothing too strong, in this bar. The box of bars is very fresh. There's no chemical or artiffcial taste w/ these. They aren't huge, but are bigger than modern-day granola bars, and they're perfect as a snack or w/ a light lunch. Carrying one in my purse as an emergency snack is something I'll do in all but the summer months. Way better, and far less dry, than all the granola bars I've eaten, too. Seriously, compare their ingredient list, protein content, sugar content & vitamin/mineral content to other protein or granola bars out there. I've eaten a lot of those different bars over the years- Quaker, Nature Valley, Pure Protein, Balance Bars, Zone Bars & more. These are superior in every way possible. I highly recommend them.

I think there's about an equal likeability for the Milk Chocolate, Milk Chocolate w/ Almonds, Dark Chocolate w/ Almonds, but no one likes the Toffee and Almonds one.  Don't get me wrong (I love toffee), but there was just a big miss on their Toffee and Almond one.  The bits are so small that you can't even taste them.<br />But other than that, the rest of the nuggets are delicious (my personal favorite is the Dark Chocolate Almond).

review/text: OMG These taste so fantastic! They are dark, dark chocolate and sweetened with organic maple syrup which is one of my favorite sweeteners; maple syrup is not raw but very nutritious for a sweetener and is probably one of my favorites second only to fresh stevia grown in my garden. This product has raw oils and was dehydrated on low termperatures. It is certified gluten-free, certified vegan, and has no refined sugar or emulsifiers. Whole Paycheck sells these for $7/2 or $3.50each so I'll buy them there until Amazon can offer a better price. The big downside to Merry's Choco Macaroons (Pack of 8) is that I can not eat just one they are sooooooooooooooo delish!

review/summary: This Product is Not Raw.
review/text: These Macaroons taste fantastic; but they are not raw. Hail Merry is advertising this product as raw and it isn't. Out of six ingredients only two are raw. The Coconut oil and sea salt are the only raw ingredients in this product. See back of package for Details.

review/summary: Delicious and Only 2 Weight Watchers Points Per Bag!
review/text: I LOVE these apple chips!  I started eating the bulk Bare Naked Apple chips.  I loved those!  Then I ran out and came back to Amazon to buy more.  They were out of the bulk so I bought these instead.  A little different apple, but with cinnamon - which I love!  I got them and tried them right away.  Totally fell in love with them.  Not only are they organic, but there are only 2 ingredients - organic apples, organic cinnamon!  No preservatives!  A whole 2.6 oz bag is only 2 Weight Watchers points.  There are 4 apples per bag.  Great low calorie, low sodium snack!  Great for kids, dieters, or just anyone who loves a good tasty snack!  You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: Delicious, but mostly crumbs
review/text: These chips taste delicious, but if you're going to eat a lot of them (and you will, once you open the bag), I would recommend buying them in the 1 lb bags from Amazon instead - a much better deal.  The flavor is crunchy and I love to eat them as a substitute for regular chips.  The only problem is that they are pretty small.  I have bought a bunch of bags and there has never been one single full apple chip, they are just pieces.  Still, you can't beat the flavor.
