review/summary: Atkins All Purpose Bake Mix
review/text: I purchased the Atkins All Purpose Bake Mix at Amazon.com.  I found that the pancakes I make with it were hard to flip.  I almost had to overcook them to get them to flip in one piece.  The biscuits I made didn't rise like they would have if I used Bisquick.  Since I am on the Atkins' diet, it is the best subitute for Bisquick I have found.  The taste  is like whole wheat products.

review/summary: Back to the drawing board on this one
review/text: I found this baking mix to be horrible, to be blunt.  It has a bad smell and taste and bakes up gummy and spongy.  I know it's a low-carb product, but honestly, I can make my own up and it tastes MUCH better than this stuff.  Not to mention, it's ridiculously over priced, especially for what you get (the aforementioned poor taste and smell)<br /><br />If you have an extra $12 - that's what I spent - to throw away on a few cups of flour, go ahead.  But, don't say I didn't warn you! :)

review/text: Read all the reviews and wanted to love this.After a few months living low carb I was craving blueberry pancakes.First,I was surprised (maybe I'm cluesless)that I had to add baking powder and half and half just for pancakes.We followed directions.Hubby is a pro on pancakes.Although they LOOKED fine when served after a few bites we realized they were raw inside.We arent sure if the blueberries threw it off or what.We got some decent pancakes making them smaller and thinner.(We added water)Not in love with this product but still willing to experiment with it.

review/text: This makes some of the best low carb pancakes around. If you use it to make cookies, be careful not to overcook. If you think they are a little undercooked, they are probably done. Otherwise, they crumble and fall apart. My nutrition students likes the almond cookies the best.

review/text: I was nervous about trying this mix but it is really good. Cant wait to try to different recipes. The pancakes with josephs sugar free syrup tastes just like regular pancakes. Low carbing can be challenging when trying to come up with different recipes but being creative and trying different foods that i have never eaten before is mind opening. Bread ande sweets were my weakness before low carbing, but now i have the perfect product to provide me with both. Make sure after mixing ingredients that you allow mix to sit for 5 min so the baking powder can take effect.

review/summary: Meh
review/text: I couldn't really stand the taste of this bake mix. I tried using it for pancakes (as per the instructions on the package), and it made this really thick dough. I had to add twice the amount of liquid that it said it needed in order to get something even remotely similar to a pancake mix. It tasted kind of gritty, and overall just wasn't my favorite. My husband also didn't like it. If I had to eat it, I would. But overall I probably won't be purchasing it again.

review/text: Works great in recipes from many low carb books. I've tried the chocolate chip muffin recipes in one of the Stella's low carb cookbooks.  It worked and tasted wonderfully good -- my kids even at them without a snide comment or any complaints at all.  We try to eat veggies and protein but if you're in a pinch and need a baked good -- this is a great item to have on hand.

It tasted so so gross. I wish I could describe the taste well but I can't. I would say it was a wheat germ, green dirty taste. I know that is vague but I'm not sure I have ever tasted anything so horrific.I threw it all out.<br />I made the same receipe and used whole wheat and the mix tasted great. I will never get this again. I thought it would be too good to be true with all the protein and it's true. Yuck!

review/text: I wasn't expecting anything spectacular, but the positive reviews on this product made me hopeful. While mixing the ingredients, a foul smell filled the kitchen. When I poured the batter into the waffle iron, the smell improved slightly. Again... hopeful. Yet while the texture resembled a waffle, the taste was so bad I spit it out immediately. No syrup/whipped creme/fruit can cover up the taste. Skip the batter and try the Atkins Caramel Chocolate Nut Roll instead. Tastes just like a Baby Ruth :)

review/summary: Not so good
review/text: After being on the Atkins diet for a few months, my partner and I decided to move from the induction phase to one that would allow for more carbs. We were craving pancakes, and after seeing this mix, I ordered it. The taste - was slightly bitter, and no where near what the traditional ones are like. I'd get it, if you want to try to add your own ingredients, potentially altering the nutritional content but enhancing the taste - but honestly, steer clear and just take a bite of a real muffin if you feel you can't go without.

There are good ways to eat healthy but this mix is not one of them.

review/summary: You must add regular flour to this
review/text: Atkins all purpose flour alone bakes like a hardened stone so for nice fluffy biscuits I would add a cup of regular flour to an equal amount of Atkins flour, 1 tablespoon baking soda and a teaspoon of salt. I would sift this all together with some oil (& a prayer) and the mix should bake up into something edible. Alittle pricey and no way of knowing whether the less carbs from the Atkins will make a difference to your waistline....but it tastes ok....with alot of sugar free jam.

review/summary: Best gluten free cake mix available!!
review/text: Both my mom & sister are gluten intolerant, so I have used many gluten free products to make cakes or other recipes for family get togethers. This is the best cake mix by far....This cake mix is just as good as wheat-based mixes. I modify it to make various kinds of cakes: coconut cake, red velvet cake, etc. It always gets rave reviews, even from those used to eating wheat-based cakes. (My mom & sister can tolerate vanilla pudding, so I add one third to half a box of instant vanilla pudding - regular, not sugar free - per bag of cake mix to make it extra moist.) I also use The Gluten Free Pantry's chocolate truffle brownie mix; it is better to me than any wheat based brownie mix.

review/summary: The BEST white cake mix, yet!!!
review/text: Myself and my children have Celiac Disease and we LOVE this mix. I use it to make cupcakes and cakes. I haven't tried the cookies yet. I did have to fiddle with the recipe to make it taste the way I wanted it to (like the real gluteny version) and it comes out better!!! My husband and all my friends say they are the best cupcakes they have ever had.<br /><br />My changes for cupcakes were:<br /><br />Veg. oil instead of shortening (use the same amount as you would shortening)<br />1 whole egg and 2 egg whites (instead of 2 whole eggs)<br />3/4-1 cup of water (the batter will look a little soupy)<br /><br />I beat the eggs 1st, then add the oil (beat some more), add water and vanilla (beat again 'till mixed), then add the dry mix (beat until fully mixed). I bake them for 12 min. The centers will still look slightly raw but take them out anyway. Because they are gluten free they have a tendency to dry out. That is why you want them to take them out at 12 min. and not allow them to cont. to bake until fully cooked. Trust me they will finish cooking after you take them out. Allow to cool in pan for 2 min. then take them out of pan but cover them to retain moisture. After they are fully cooled frost and then recover. If you have a cupcake holder/carrier w/ a lid that is perfect.<br /><br />For cake:<br />Same ingredient change as cupcakes except I bake the cake for about 23-25 min instead of 28 like the recipe says. Also, grease and flour the pan.

review/text: I tried both the cookie and the cake from this mix.  The cake was dry and had a flat taste.  It did not taste like a normal yellow or white cake at all. I had to use lots of frosting to get this cake to stick together somewhat on my fork.  As for the cookies, they were extremely crumbly and fell apart the minute you bit into it.  I have several mixes left that I am going to experiment with to try to get them moister. Covering after baking normally works for regular cakes to retain moisture, but did not for this mix. If you can stand the crumblies, the cookies did taste good.

I can send one as a treat to school when I know that other kiddos are bringing in birthday goodies.  Other mixes I have tried basically turn to powder when thawed after freezing.

review/summary: Love the snickerdoodle recipe!
review/text: There is a recipe on the back of the package for snickerdoodle cookies.  The recipe calls for 8 T. butter or 4 T. butter plus TOFU.  Who knew you could bake with tofu?  I was curious so I tried it.  Outstanding!  Even my very-picky-eater children loved these cookies.  We will definitely be baking these again and again...

review/summary: Flavor good, but a bit dry
review/text: This cake mix is flavorful but tends to be a bit dry. What is really handy though is the COOKIE recipe on the back of the package. I think this mix would make a good cookie. I haven't tried it yet but I will since I recently purchased a case of this brand. What we did with the cake is serve it with ice cream and that helped the dryness factor. Also you can put it in a bowl and pour milk or cream over it and eat it with a spoon and it's pretty tasty that way. Thank goodness for frosting and milk!

review/summary: Combine with Simply Organic Mixes for Delicious, Moist cakes
review/text: I've been looking for a simple way to enjoy gluten-free banana bread for months and came upon Simply Organic Banana Bread mix. So I took half a pkg. of Gluten-Free Pantry Old Fashioned Cake and Cookie mix and half a pkg. of Simply Organic Banana Bread mix and combined together with 2 eggs, 1 tsp of vanilla, 3/4 cup of milk and half a stick of butter. I used a mixer on medium speed as I added 3 over-ripened bananas(you need 3 bananas instead of two for moisture) and pecans. I poured the mixture into an 8x8 glass pan and baked for 45 minutes. The end result was the BEST banana bread, with or without gluten, I have ever tasted!. We ate our slices with butter and cream cheese and devoured it in less than two days. I look forward to using the same method with the Simply Organic Carrot Cake mix and Lemon Cake soon!

review/text: There is no such thing as a bad Nutter Butter, DC. Even stale. Even wet. Even in crumb form. From the fine peanut form, to the oh-so-creamy and delectably sweet/salty center, to the vintage advertising (who doesn't want yet another Nutter Butter Peanut Butter Sandwich cookie?), the only other competition in the field is Oreos. And only if you replace the chocolate cookie with a peanut butter one. And the disgusting white stuff with peanut butter. And change the boring circular shape to something more reminiscent of an infinity symbol.

Amazon ships these well packed so that they don't get destroyed, in four boxes of twelve - four cookie packs (so 192 cookies for your).  Each of the four boxes were the same you would find in a store like 7-11, so they also would be perfect for bake-sale/fundraiser/whatever type stuff.  Not a whole lot more to say, if you like the product and you need a large amount, or want to use them over time, it's a pretty good deal.  If not, look elsewhere!

These guys come close, so if I run out of Girl Scout cookies, these are nearby. I've been buying these for years, about 20 to be exact and even with some changes, they're still very good.  A great tip - if  you love chocolate and peanut butter together, smash these up and sprinkle them on some chocolate ice cream!  Anyway, be sure to try these if you love peanut butter cookies - they're pretty hard to find here in Ohio! Recommend!

review/summary: A FIVE star product with only TWO star shipping
review/text: I use this oil for a number of recipes and for sauteing any veggies or meat. It is very hard to find, especially at an economical price. So I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon for about $5 per tin. The fact that the item is fulfilled by Amazon and qualifies for free shipping clinched the deal for me.<br /><br />Amazon shipped my order very quickly. Unfortunately, they used a box that was twice as tall and twice as wide as the four tins sealed in their plastic bag. Amazon used "air bags" as the padding...most of which were not inflated. You could hear the tins clunking around in the box when it arrived.<br /><br />Needless to say, all four tins were badly dented...one won't even stand up. So I notified Amazon of the problem, explained it was the result of inappropriate packaging, and they immediately notified me that they were processing a replacement shipment of four tins. Great!<br /><br />The replacement shipment arrived within days. Again in a box four times the size required; again padded with the same barely-inflated (and totally useless for this heavy item) "air bags"; again clunking around as the UPS delivery man scanned the box and handed it to me. LUCKILY, the tins have only minor dents this time.<br /><br />I tried to leave packaging feedback on the replacement shipment, to advise Amazon that they STILL aren't packging this item appropriately...but it turns out you can't leave feedback on a replacement shipment.<br /><br />I really don't know if the denting is a result of Amazon's poor shipping, or if the product they have to sell is in dented cans. Either way, Amazon should do something about it. They should either warn customers if the product is available only in dented cans, or package this item in an appropriately sized box so that it doesn't bang around in transit and end up damaged.

review/text: If you like to use Garlic Oil in your dishes, go no further.  This oil is the BEST!  I discovered it at Big Lots and loved it. I stocked up on it until they no longer sold it.  What to do???? Go to Amazon.com, they have everything.<br /><br />Sure enough, it is here!  This Tuscan Sun Roasted Garlic Oil is strong and great.  One only needs a little while cooking as the oil is permeated with garlic oils.  The flavor is fantastic.  Everyone loves my roasted vegetables.  I brush the vegetables with Tuscan Sun Roasted Garlic Oil and grind Kosher salt over them.  That's it and it's a great hit!<br /><br />Mix your mashed potatoes with this oil and your guests will come for more.  Spread the oil on sour dough bread, sprinkle some parmessan cheese and parsley on the bread, put it under the broiler until golden brown and voil&eacute;. . . Another hit.<br /><br />Marinade prawns in the oil and put on the grill.  Brush it on steaks while the steaks are "resting" to give a wonderful taste and make the steaks glisten.<br /><br />I can go on and on.<br /><br />You will NOT be disappointed with this product.

review/summary: Tasty Garlic Oil!!
review/text: Great tasting garlic oil.  The label in the bottle indicates it's a blend of canola, soybean, and olive oils.  My preference is to have a healthier/higher dosage of monounsaturated fat as this is found in both olive and canola oils.  Since the label indicates more polyunsaturated fat than monounsaturated fat, there must be more soybean oil in the content than the other two oils.  In any case, both types of unsaturated fats are better for you than saturated fats, so this garlic oil is good to use for all dishes!

review/text: I actually love the product itself, but do not recommend ordering through Amazon. I got my first shipment, and the cans were leaking and looked like someone beat them with a baseball bat. Amazon sent a replacement, and they were only a hair better. Still leaking and dented up. Not sure if it is just this product or if it is just cans in general, but I would not order again.

review/summary: Just so you can't say "No one told me"!!!
review/text: To paraphrase an earlier rewviewer's comments..the product is fine...the packaging is horrible!!<br /><br />First...the product: It is just what is says it is,with one minor caviat.., it's Olive,(Pomace)oil! It's a distiction with a difference.<br />If you're thinking this is EVOO...(or if that is important to your purchacing decision), it's not.., and you should know this.<br />As far as garlic flavored product for frying or sauteing..,it's perfectly fine...and that's just what I wanted!<br />The price overall,(especially if you get free shipping)...is great!!<br /><br />Now...the pagkaging!!<br /><br />This is terrible packaging..,(almost non existant interior protection)that's really the best you could say!!<br />As you can see...I'm not the first to complain. No one in their right mind would assume this is an acceptable method for packaging these containers!! One(of my four), was already leaking...the other three were severly dented! I transfered them to glass containers as I could'nt be assured they wouldn't leak in storage.<br />I would send them back if I had any thought that I wouldn't receive another identically poorly packaged shipment in return!<br />As was mentioned by another reviewer...DO NOT order these as gifts!!<br /><br />Are there humans packing these boxes...or primates? Just wondering!!!!

review/summary: The best!
review/text: In 2007 my husband and I were in France so  he could ride his bicycle in the P-B-P--an amateurs' ride. We discovered Lavazza coffee at a nearby Mall--where I asked the barista to show me what coffee she was using. I began looking for the coffee, and found that Amazon offered it. I've been buying the 1.1 pound bricks through Amazon's Subscription service ever since. It is not bitter, and has a deep coffee taste. We put 4 expressos (now you know why I use decaf!)  into 20 oz. cups with heated, foamed milk and a teaspoon of brown sugar. Ambrosia!

As a person that can not tolerate, Gluten, corn in any form, soy, any form of emulsifier, or food color, I have to be carefull. I tried this and it really improved the texture of the bread I baked. My family is happy with it, The only reservation I have is that I was a little dizzy the day after I ate it so I will wait a week and test it again. I really hope I am NOT sensitive to this as non gluten bread is not so good with out it. I will continue to use it for the family as every one else have had good results from it.

review/text: I read the one glowing review of 1883 Pumpkin Spice Syrup and decided to try it, as I love the pumpkin flavored coffees in fall and winter! I recieved and immediately tried a spoonful to taste, ugh, tasted like cough syrup, very medicinal and not at all like a lovely pumpkin flavor I was expecting. To give it a fair shake, I made a cup of my favorite dark roast and added a few pumps, still awful, no pumpkin flavor just medicinal again! Too bad I have a whole bottle now, and beleived the one reviewer. Please try another brand!

review/text: I would recommend this salt more for aesthetics than for taste.  Though this salt isn't my favorite sea salt flavor-wise, every once in a while I appreciate its 'high-pitched ping' aftertaste.  The hunky, flaky crystals can be as large as a single die and can be crushed in between the fingers, if one has strong fingers.  Taste:  3.75 stars.  Aesthetics: 4.5 Stars.

review/summary: Good Clean Taste But Wet Salt Requires A Special Salt Mill
review/text: I didn't realize that this was a wet sea salt or that wet sea salt doesn't work well in regular salt mills.  My salt mill produced very little volume when using this salt and even after washing the mill thoroughly it had to be replaced because of what I assume to be resulting corrosion.  I did some research and learned that this is typical when using wet sea salt in a regular salt mill and that Peugeot has developed a wet salt mill to address this problem, however, it seemed to me that the reviews were mixed and I purchased a regular salt mill and dry sea salt.

review/text: I like to be able to offer coffee to my clients, or tea, so a Keurig coffee maker has become a tattoo studio essential. This tasty flavor means I don't have to keep half&half or creamer on hand, you get a perfect mild creamy brew instantly. Much of the time I like a black tea, but if I'm feeling like something more sweet and milky this hits the spot.

review/text: I was going to say the same thing the other buyer said (I placed my order before her review.)  Was hoping the suckers were 6" not the sucker and stick combo.  Other sucker descriptions on Amazon say the sucker is 2.5" and the stick is 4" which is the case here.  I'm disappointed in the description but still able to use them.  Also the box and suckers have stickers that say "Oriental Trading."
