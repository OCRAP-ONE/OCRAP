review/summary: Good price, good stuff.
review/text: I usually order 4 boxes of 6 of this a month, and buy 1-2 of the powdered formula from the store. This is cheaper than if you were to buy it at the store (about $6 in store, about $5 online) and I like how it's delivered right to your door so  you don't have to fill your cart up and lug them back and forth.

review/text: Great formula my grandson has been on this since his mother had to stop breastfeeding.  He seems to think it is just as good and is growing very fast.  He has gained 13 pounds since he began drinking this and he is not chubby.  He is very tall.  Better to have delivered than to buy at store and have to haul it home.  Too heavy for a grandma.

review/text: I was using the RTF bottles to go for supplementing breastfeeding on the go and for night feedings.<br />After returning to work, this is more economical. My son drinks 5 ounces every 3.5-4 hours. I pour these so his caregiver is able to feed him when I'm at work. This usually comes to 2 feedings during the day. I try to feed him before I leave. Occasionally, I'll leave a 2 ounce bottle just in case he needs more than I breastfed him for the next four hour span.<br /><br />Similac Feeding Guidelines are on their website, but I've copy and pasted them below:<br /><br />Birth-1 week: 6-10 feedings per day (approx every 2.5 - 4h); 2-3 fl oz per feeding<br />1 week-1 month: 7-8 feedings per day (approx every 3 - 3.5h); 2-4 fl oz per feeding<br />1-3 months: 5-6 feedings per day (approx every 4 - 4.5h) ; 4-5 fl oz  per feeding<br />3-6 months: 4-5 feedings per day (approx every 4.5 - 6h); 6-7 fl oz  per feeding<br />6-9 months: 3-4 feedings per day (approx every 6 - 8h) ; 7-8 fl oz  per feeding<br />9-12 months: 3  feedings per day (approx every 8h); 7-8 fl-oz per feeding<br /><br />Every baby is different. My son is currently 10 weeks old. He should be eating every 4 hours. He's usually screaming at me by 3.5h (not at all ready for 4.5 hour stretches). So I feed him every 3.5 hours (sometimes even every 3 hours). He's healthy and happy. He used to wake up multiple times during the night for more feedings. He now sleeps through the majority of the night. If he wakes up, I breastfeed him at night. If he's still upset, I supplement with about 2 ounces.<br /><br />In looking at their recommended feedings, I can't imagine my son eating every 8 hours, because I eat more frequently. At a minimum, I eat every four hours during the day. After dinner, I don't eat again until the morning. This is the only potential 8 hour stretch I'm seeing... but who knows! My doctor says we should start discussing the addition of foods to my sons diet on his next visit. He'll be 3 months by then.<br /><br />In regards to his poop... Diapers look the same as they did when I was breastfeeding. When speaking with Similac about "shipping temperatures" .. they mentioned that  their carrier was aware of proper temperatures to ship their product, which could cause delays in shipping during extreme temperatures. I'm not sure if Amazon does this. But... I can say, Amazon has never let my baby go hungry. This is the fastest shipping item on Amazon. I have never had to go elsewhere to buy overpriced Similac.

review/summary: Formula is great, packaging needs improvement
review/text: My daughter likes both Similac ready to feed formula and Enfamil's ready to feed formula.  I chose Similac because I find it to be less expensive than Enfamil.  My only issue w/ the Similac Advance 32 oz bottle is the seal.  It's a thick, aluminum and plastic? seal which you have to use the cap cutter to open.  Your fingers really need to be kept dry to get the cut out circle out which is hard to do after shaking the bottle in preparation to feed your baby.  I've wrestled w/ getting it off the bottle lip even though it's only on by a hair after using the cutter so many times.  Last night I sliced my thumb open on the tin, about 2 inches across, just trying to get it off the bottle!  I'm going to try Enfamil now which comes in cans; I can't afford to lose the use of my thumb for days while it heals again.

review/summary: This milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(
review/text: Sorry to give this 1 star. but this milk really makes our baby really sick!! :(, literally!!<br />if your baby can take it, I guess it's a good one but for us, we had the worst experience with it.<br /><br />Here is our story.<br />My baby had been solely breastfed. After 9 months my wife was running short of her milk. She didn't have enough breastmilk for the baby and he didn't take as much solid food as we would want him to.<br />We gave him Similac Advance, it was recommended by the hospital. First Similac Advance Liquid, he threw up 9 times within 2 hours after half an hour of feeding. That happened twice. A few days later, we tried Similac Advance power, he threw up again! This time 5 times plus serious diarrhea for 5 days. He has lost 5% of his weight within 2 days. That's really bad.<br /><br />We were desperate. We took him to the hospital twice that week. The doctor though it was stomach flu.<br />However, I didn't quit agree with him. What a coincident that 2 different formula milk feeding incidents would throw my baby off balance. I'm a computer engineer and dealing with solving and debugging problems all the time.<br />I was firm with the doctor that this was not a coincident. I thought it might have something to do with the protein in the formula that my baby couldn't digest. We decided to try Lactose free formula (Nutramigen from Enflora). It smell and taste really awful (my wife tried it and she gagged.<br />As we thought, my baby rejected to drink it. Then I tried Good Start soy. Same story, smell bad but not as bad as Nutromigen. My baby also rejected to drink it.<br /><br />Now we were really desperate, not enough milk for him and he doesn't like to eat solid food!! He would throw up + diarrhea if he gave him normal formula milk. Phone call to 4 advise nurses, no luck! I finally search on the internet and found a lot of similar story to what we experienced (including this on Amazon reviews).<br />I decided to give it a final try, crossing our fingers really tight. Good Start Gentle Plus is our last hope or my baby would not have any more milk to drink. He's losing weight!!<br /><br />And then miracle happened!!! This milk works wonderfully for him. The only complain I would have is that it doesn't smell as good as the normal cow milk-based formula, however, doesn't smell or taste awful like the other two.<br /><br />My baby didn't quite used to the tasted in the beginning and didn't really want to drink it at first. So we tried mixed it with breastmilk for a few days.<br /><br />Now he is a happy baby, gaining weight, doesn't throw up and used to the taste of it.<br />My wife and I are now happy again :)

It was certainly better than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OWR0XU">EIGHT O'CLOCK COFFEE 100% COLOMBIAN 96 K CUPS</a> that I tried before this cup.<br /><br />For twenty years, Eight O'Clock Colombian, ground fresh at A&P, was the only coffee we drank.  So I ordered both it and the dark Italian just as soon as they became available.  Either my tastes have changed or the coffee has changed but I found the Colombia version weak and lacking in character.<br /><br />The Eight O'Clock Italian Roast, however, was stout enough and should be to most people's liking.  I brewed it at the 7 oz (middle button) size and tried it without cream and then with a single squirt of coffee creamer.  It was strong enough to not let the cream taste dominate.<br /><br />The bad news is that it does not come up to the standard of either <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OLKF6K">Barista Prima Coffeehouse, Italian Roast, 24- Count K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig Brewers</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0IZAS">Timothy's World Coffee Rainforest Espresso K-Cup (48 count)</a>.

review/summary: You'll either love them or hate them
review/text: There's no true middle ground as far as these go. I've passed these around to others and have found that you either adore this new flavor or it's something that you just want to avoid like the plague.<br /><br />In true Tic Tac fashion, there's a hint of mint here in order to try to give lip service to the idea that this product was originally supposed to freshen your breath, or at least some version of the brand are. This didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of the candy, although it does sort of give you a little pause when you first eat them. As far as the strawberry flavor goes, this is as far from a real strawberry flavor as you can get while still tasting decent. If you're hoping for anything other than an artificial flavor that resembles something berry-ish, then you might want to stick to the other flavors of Tic Tac. This is strawberry enough to recognize it, but I can't help but think that if I were to have this placed into a pile of other flavors, I might not be able to immediately identify it as such. I do like these, but I want to really stress that if you're looking for strawberry-strawberry flavor rather than the candy companies' interpretation of strawberry over the years, you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Overall though, I liked this enough to buy it again several times. That there's a cute nod to the Beatles via the name is nice and will no doubt pull several people in to purchase them.

review/text: I absolutely LOVE these Strawberry Fields tic tacs. I found them at a Walgreens in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina while I was on vacation visiting my brother and his family. I bought 2 packs, and then went back and bought 5 more. Then I got back to the little town in Alaska that I live in and can't find them here anywhere. So here I am ordering them from Amazon. So happy to have found them here. I don't like mint or peppermint, I don't like the orange or melon or grapefruit, etc. The one and only tic tac flavor I like is the Strawberry Fields, although I haven't tried the cherry, so I may try them.

review/summary: Strong and In A Class Of Its Own
review/text: I love this brand since discovering it 6-7 years ago, (and I have hooked my father on the cranberries & almond bar, and chocolate and raspberry bar), and this brand is amazingly among the lowest priced for "natural" chocolate (it's less than $3 a bar at my local grocery stores). I don't drink coffee because I'm sensitive to high amounts of caffeine, but I love the smell of it, and coffee ice cream, so I LOVE this espresso chocolate!  This flavor is rich and strong, with a subtly bitter finish from the espresso beans, so a little goes a long way!<br />A warning: if you are not used to dark chocolate, then this is probably not the flavor to begin with, unless you are a coffee fiend.  I suggest maybe starting with an Endangered Species milk chocolate flavor first, and working your way up (too bad they don't still make the Panda bar, a blend of dark and white chocolate!). It may even be better for some novices to first try a different brand of dark chocolate with 55-60% cocoa content, like Godiva or Chocolove, and then gradually work their way up (since to my knowledge E. Species doesn't have any dark chocolate with less than 72% cocoa content).

review/text: I am a foodie - grew up in the restaurant business and have a penchant for sweets. I exercise regularly and eat a clean diet for the most part, so, loading up on sweets or junk is not an option for me. But, when I do get a craving for chocolate, I try to be as healthy in my choices without compromising flavor.<br />I'm also a coffee-junkie (my one remaining vice), so, once I tasted the ES Tiger bar with espresso beans, I was hooked. I can have two to three squares in between meals with some raw nuts, berries or some other fruit and I'm satisfied. The espresso beans are crushed, so, they sort of melt in your mouth along with the chocolate. Very satisfying and for a great cause - you won't be disappointed. Never a stale piece.

I was looking for a jar sauce that I could use and enjoy when I didn't have the time to prepare my own sauce recipe.<br />Vincent's is good but not great. I've tried a number of premium sauces and at this point I prefer Michael's of Brooklyn marinara sauce. It can be purchased either on line at their site, at Amazon or at Whole Foods Market where occasionally it's on sale for $5/jar ($10 regularly).

review/summary: Great value, good company service
review/text: This is a great help with my reduced-carb diet plan, and more. I use this about half-and-half with cornstarch, or sometimes by itself, to thicken sauces. (Note: By itself, it only takes about one-half the amount to thicken as cornstarch, but when used alone, it has a tendency to "flatten" the flavor of the liquid it's thickening.) I also sometimes use arrowroot powder to thicken fruit-based sauces -- unlike cornstarch, arrowroot powder doesn't cloud whatever liquid is used. And, buying this form, in bulk, is far less expensive than those little bottles in the spice section of the grocery store -- compared to this product, those are an extreme ripoff in price. The company is always great to order from too.

And of course I LOVE Barry Farms; their delivery has always been trouble free and the communication is excellent.  The product is always exactly as described and I'm fully confident in all their gluten free products!  Love you guys.

I do not know if it is the product or the cans but I wanted to make my own and find a way to freeze some of those products.  Since sauces and gravies break down when frozen (really nasty), I had to find something besides flour and cornstarch.  So far I love this for thickening things like chili, spaggetti sauce, etc.  I am still experimenting and haven't perfected the proportions yet but I will get there.

review/summary: Buyers BEWARE!
review/text: I placed an order online with Barry Farms on December 29th.  Their website stated that orders would be processed and shipped within 48 hours or at most 7 days. After my initial order confirmation, I heard nothing from the company about when my order would be shipped. I emailed them to ask about my order on January 9th and was responded to on January 12th (14 days after my order was placed) stating that one of my items was back-ordered. Their website specifically states that they do not hold orders for back-ordered items. I then called the company and told them I needed the items (with or without the backordered items) no later than January 22nd.  They ensured me that it would arrive by then.  I received an email on January 18th informing me that my order had shipped without the backordered items and I would be receiving a refund for the missing items.  However, the package did not arrive on the 22nd as promised, forcing me to purchase the items elsewhere.  I then emailed the merchant and asked for a refund of the shipping charges since they do not accept returns.  I was refused, stating that since the error was with UPS, they were not at fault (even though their website says they ship within 7 days, which they did not, and do not hold for back-ordered items, which they did).  This is unacceptable behavior from any merchant.  I should have been able to return my items for a full refund or at minimum received a refund for the shipping charges.  Now I am out $28 for items I no longer need and cannot use.

I saw this in the pet store and decided to try it and that's what they have been eating now for two years. I love buying this big bag and putting it in an airtight storage bin because it saves me a lot of money rather than buying the small bags at the store all the time. They both have nice solid poos that don't smell horrible and they are both very regular on this food. I will not buy anything else for my boys! :-)

review/summary: Gentle ginger taste
review/text: 5 packets of this tea was included with my order of Gold Kili ginger tea. I tried them both to see which I like better. They actually taste about the same, but this is more expensive and the packets are bigger. The tea is pre-sweetened with honey and sugar but it is not too sweet if I use a 6 oz mug. The flavor is not strong so those who like a little bite to their ginger tea may find this a little weak. Still, on a cold rainy day, this would be nice to sip while relaxing.

review/summary: The best Chai ever!
review/text: I have been drinking Tipu's Chai religiously for over a year now. I prefer the Chai now simple life. It has the most wonderful flavors an allows me to add almond milk and my own sweetener (stevia). I had to stop drinking coffee for health reasons and Tipu chai has made the transition so easy. I need to get some decaf too so I can have it at night. The price point scared me at first but you barely have to use any of the powder to make a nice cup of tea. I use less than the recommended amount. All in all I highly recommend Tipu's Chai. It is authentic, has simple ingredients, and is affordable.

My favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's: Clearly superior ingredients, the most malt flavor. My husband's favorite.<br /><br />Bissinger's Pumpkin:  Very good but not what I expected. Instead of using pumpkin pie spices they use real pumpkin.<br /><br />All arrived carefully packed with cold packs (shipping is expensive).<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Great flavor - too much chocolate
review/text: I have to agree with the other reviewer.  As much as I love chocolate, there is way too much on these.  The ratio of chocolate to malted milk center is crazy.  These would taste so much better if they had a normal amount of chocolate on them.  You end up tasting more chocolate than malt.  It would be nice if they would come out with a modified version that had a larger malted milk center and a regular amount of chocolate coating.  The flavors are great just, the overall size is great, just the ratios are off.

review/text: Hoping this condiment would be a better tasting, higher quality "dijonnaise" - a dijon mustard and mayo hybrid, low calorie creamy mustard spread. Grey Poupon dijon mustard is a great product so I was disappointed in this product. While zero calorie, it tasted a little "off", slight bitter and stale aftertaste. I prefer the French's version of a dijoannaise over this product. Has more zing and is creamier.  The offer here was affordable and we did use the product but would not purchase again.

review/summary: Canidae Often Given High Praise
review/text: Canidae makes lots of flavors and types of dog food.  My Goldens have had endless issues with allergy problems.  Professional breeders and dog show people have recommended Canidae for it's grain free relative low cost dog food.  I have more "faith" in the quality of this brand than most and prices are reasonable in the higher priced group.<br /><br />My Golden "Amber" (eyes) does not seem to relish this flavor.  She is much more particular than any dog before so the search goes on.  So far I have four small bags of dog food and still searching for her preference.  Salmon is next.  At least Amber shows no problems with allergies which is common among pure breeds.<br /><br />Did notice since I adopted her coat which was fairly thin and easy to see the skin has changed dramatically.  In about three months mostly on this food type she has grown a thick undercoat which was normal on my last and missed Golden "Arrow".<br /><br />If you want an ANGEL personality in your dog choose a Golden Retriever but only if you can give generously of your love and kindness.  My Goldens get very stressed if I get stressed and speak loudly.  Most Goldens think all people are family relations and can't wait to run and greet but your still number one.  But she is not enthusiastic for this particular food.
