review/text: I was somewhat hesitant to purchase cookies via amazon given the fact that another person had complained about receiving broken cookies, but I was delighted to see how much care the seller took in properly packaging the product; I opened a pack last night and there wasn't a single broken cookie and the cookies were fresh. Just as the description says, you receive 4 12 oz packs of Chips Ahoy! chocolate chip cookies. I would definitely purchase again.

review/summary: Great gluten-free lasagne noodles
review/text: Tinkyada brown rice pasta lasagne noodles live up to the description on the packaging - they cook up firm, not mushy, in the context of lasagne. In my lasagne, the pasta is not at the forefront of the ingredients; I use marinara, multiple meats, and spinach (no cheese as Bucky is also allergic to dairy). My husband, who has no food allergies, happily eats lasagne made with this pasta without noting any off flavors or textures.<br />For dishes where the pasta is at the forefront of the ingredients, our go-to pasta is typically quinoa pasta, mainly because of the greater nutritional value, more protein and fiber, but also because the texture is similar to wheat-based pasta; however, I have not been able to find quinoa-based lasagne noodles and am very happy that Tinkyada makes these noodles.

review/text: This is the best gluten-free lasagna I've had!  It doesn't break apart in the boiling process; it doesn't get mushy after baking.  It also tastes great after reheating it in the microwave, which is very rare for gluten-free pasta.  My husband, who is not allergic to gluten, also thinks the taste and texture of this pasta is great!

review/summary: Unusual colors, large crystals
review/text: It's a bit pricey with shipping, but I bought this because this brand has unusual colors.  I needed purple for a King Cake, and here in Illinois you just can't find purple sugar.  I actually like this brand quite a bit, and would recommend it.<br /><br />The colors are nice and bright compared to some cheaper brands I've seen.  The first thing I noticed, however, is that the sugar crystals are LARGE compared to the near-shavings I get from the colored sugars I got at the local grocery store.  I guess I'll have to go buy the Green and Gold ones too, so they match next time.

review/summary: This granola packs a healthy punch as a daily meal OR as a snack while I'm on a photo safari
review/text: Hands down, this granola is just what I need for a great start to my day or as a snack while I'm kayaking in Florida, on a wilderness canoe outing in the Boundary Waters of Minnesota, snow skiing in the Rockies, or on my way to teach one of my college classes. My students love it too. I like it because it's healthy and not overly sweet. What makes it my on-the-go snack of choice is it tastes great right out of the package -- the snack size packs are ideal for travel OR I just make my own with resealable sandwich bags. I've been enjoying this granola for over 20 years, and I'm glad it now comes in other flavors for variety. I've never tired of the taste of the original flavor, but I do love cinnamon and honey so the new ones seem like they've been made just for me. Thanks Mona! You're a gem! I also like how I can write to or call Mona and she is actually on the other end. She's a real human being and stands behind her wonderful products. -- How's THAT in this day and age of huge corporations that are out-of-touch with their customers? Not so at [...].

I've not seen another vanilla extract that has the beans in the bottle as well (a brilliant combination).

I LOVE this product, but cannot justify purchasing it at this rate (plus the insane shipping). I am rating this product based on the quality alone, not the price or processing.

review/text: I use the product almost daily (swim, bike, run)- I like the fruit punch flavor better than the lemonade oddly, because I LOVE lemonade.  The primary reason I use this product is for the "lite" version that is is.  The decreased sugar content compared to regular-strength Accelerade is key - but still provides a small amount of protein.  I have not had any GI issues with this product which is also key for me.  I wish the Hydro version was fortified with Vitamin C like the regular strength is....otherwise, it does the job.

review/summary: From my Blog
review/text: [...]<br /><br />I picked up 2 packages of Accelerade Hydro today.  Accelerade is the direct competitor to my favorite drink powder; Endurox R4.  Both Endurox and Accelerade use the 4:1 ratio of carbs to protein.  There is a version of Endurox R4 called "Restore" which has fewer calories and less sugar than the original but I have yet to find it when I need it so instead I will be reviewing the competitors product:<br /><br />Accelerade HYDRO<br />Usage Instructions: Mix 1 packet with 12oz of water. Use before, during, and after exercise.<br />Copy: All the rehydration and endurance benefits of a regular sports drink with: 30% fewer calories; 55% less sugar<br />The secret of Accelerade Hydro is the patented and proven 4-1 carbohydrate-protein ration. Studies show that Accelerade Hydro:<br />Enhances Rehydration - Rehydrates athletes as effectively as a regular sports drink and twice as effectively as water.<br />Extends Endurance - Extends endurance as much as a regular sports drink and 48% more than water.<br /><br />Calories: 60<br />Calories from Fat: 0<br />Total Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 5mg<br />Sodium: 180mg<br />Potassium: 55mg<br />Carbs: 10g<br />Sugars: 8g<br />Protein: 2.5<br /><br />Warnings: Contains milk and soy. Manufactured in a facility that processes eggs, wheat, tree nuts, fish, crustaceans, and shellfish products.  Wait what?!?<br /><br />Honestly that is a strange mixture of products to be pushing through the same facilities.<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />I tried this product according to the instructions and can report that the product desolves fairly easily into cold water and definitly tastes like lemonade although there is a hint of creamy flavor on the backend that is neither welcome nor a deal-breaker.  there is a certain weight to these drink powders I notice with Endurox as well which is why I never mix it into just 12oz of water,  typically I will mix it into 21oz or more; besides who carries around only 12oz of water?  I dont know if dilluting it into more water has any kind of negative effect on the product ability to produce results but I doubt it.  All in all I find this product just as useful as any other recovery drink and the packaging very convenient to throw in the gym bag; although I find throwing a shaker bottle with a servings worth of dry powder into my gym bag just as convenient and much cheaper than the $1.75 I spent on this one serving.<br /><br />Comparing it directly to Endurox R4 I can appreciate the benefit of lower calories and sugar however I would like to try Endurox R4 Restore and compare the Nutritional info on both before making any blanket statements as to my preferance of one over the other.  That being said Accelerade is the only one available in a lemonade flavor which is a nice change from the barrels of fruit punch Endurox I have been going through.

review/summary: I Have Definitely Noticed A Difference
review/text: I bought Accelerade Hydro (Lemonade Flavor) because it seemed like the best substitute for the P90X Results and Recovery Formula. It features the same 4-1 Carbs to Protein formula to allow for quick muscle recovery after a taxing workout, and the taste is very easy to get used to. I haven't tried the P90X Results and Recovery or the Fruit Punch flavor of Accelerade Hydro, so I have no basis for comparison on that topic.<br /><br />However, I can definitely say, I've noticed a huge difference in how I feel after my workouts. Before Accelerade Hydro, I had the all-too-familiar muscle soreness the next day - where almost any time I moved - I would experience some form of pain in my muscles (what the trainers like to call, "that good pain"). While I'm used to that - being someone who's played sports my entire life - it's not fun, and it makes pushing yourself hard the next day, less desirable. I like to be excited for my workouts, not dreading them. The soreness is still there, but it's nowhere near as prevalent. I'd say it went from an 80% down to about 15%...Seriously.<br /><br />The label says you can drink this before, during or after your workouts, but I definitely prefer right after. The only reason I don't like drinking it during, is because it doesn't rinse my mouth of that thick saliva like water does. Plus, it's kind of like a little treat right after I'm finished.<br /><br />Be sure to drink this within an hour of finishing your workout. It'll benefit you the most in that time period. Also, to respond to what someone else mentioned about a scoop not being in the tub, it's supposed to come with one. When you get the tub, it should have a seal underneath the screw-off top (similar to ketchup, kinda...you get the idea). So if you get your tub and it isn't sealed, I would send it back for an exchange.<br /><br />Overall, I love this stuff. I'm thinking of stocking up just so I don't have to worry about ordering for a few months. Also note: it's 50 servings! Results and Recovery tub is half that and about twice as expensive on Amazon.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Amazing Jelly
review/text: This is the most amazing rose petal jelly I have ever eaten.  I was first introduced to this Jelly at Harad's Tea Room in London and have been yearning for it ever since.  I made a batch of scones and put this amazing jelly on them.  They were delicious!!!!!  This jelly is so good it is almost magical.

review/summary: Yum!!!!
review/text: I had picked up a jar of rose jelly at Marshall's a few years ago, and fell in love with the wonderful flavor. If you love the way roses smell, you'll adore the taste of this sweet, delicate jelly.  I kept searching for more of the amazing jelly, but was always disappointed. Finally, I found it here on Amazon, and even though it's not the same brand as I had before, it is just as delicious. There are little shreds of real rose petal in the jelly, and the rose aroma fills your palate. Yes, roses are among the many edible flowers. It is a little pricey (compared to something like grape jelly), but so worth it! I've made jelly tarts with this, along with the jasmine flower jelly, for guests, and everyone was blown away with the novelty of this delicious treat.

review/text: I was so excited to try this based on the other review here but to my disappointed surprise, this is just terrible tasting jelly.  It MUST be an acquired taste. Several of my coworkers tried it too, because I thought I would just give it to someone, and not a single one liked it. Four of us tried it and one described it as like walking into a room recently sprayed rose scented air freshener and getting choked up on it. Definitely do not recommend.

review/text: I like this Tulsi tea but it is not ground very fine at all. It kind of looks like they just dried the plant out then crumpled it up into the bag. I think most people would find it hard to fit this into one of those metal tea balls or a teabag even. I have a metal straw I use that I originally got for drinking Yerba Mate. I can just throw this in a cup with hot water and drink it through the straw. Anyone buying this might also want to buy an herb grinder of some kind or a metal straw like I have which is called a bombillla.

The mix contains pretzels in different shapes (it would be nice to have fewer pretzels and more of the other stuff) with variety of rice crackers, honey sesame chips (my favorite!), cajun corn sticks, chilli cheese corn twists, and wasabi peas(another of my favorites). the blend will satisfy those who want the sweet/salty combination and then the bonus of a spicy kick. I just wish there were fewer pretzels, since they are not my favorite (hence, the 4 stars). Great party snack, I think if you added some of your favorite nuts, e.g., almonds, peanuts, or cashews it would be good also! The packaging is great and the canisters (barrels) can be reused for other snacks if you are so inclined.

It gives the stew a very rich, delicious flavor. The flavor of the carrots, potatoes, and peas in the stew really seem to pop, and the beef acquires a delicious taste. My kids love my beef stew.

They have a depth of savory flavor that teases the palate like a good wine.

review/text: These San-J Black Sesame Rice Crackers are so good that I just eat them by themselves. I also like the San-J sesame brown rice made with regular sesame seeds instead of black sesame seeds, but like these black sesame variety a bit more. They are especially helpful for me if I'm too busy to eat in general (I need to be relaxed usually), but I can digest these with no problem and eat them while working at the computer, and the sesame seeds give more nutritional value. They have a lot of sesame seeds on them.<br /><br />I just wish Amazon still sold them directly (preferably in Subscribe & Save) at a cheaper price. This price is out of my range, even before shipping is added. I know that I got the San-J sesame brown rice variety by the case from Amazon in summer 2009 for about $35 (free shipping), but the only ones sold now by Amazon (in Fall 2010) seem to be the plain tamari rice crackers (no sesame). Will have to keep searching to replenish my pantry with them at a better price.

review/text: I have been using this flavor wheatgerm for 37 years and now find myself living in an area where it is not sold anywhere. I have asked 2 managers of 2 different grocery stores to order it for me and they said they couldn't. When I was in Florida a couple of years ago I bought every jar they had in the local grocery store just so I would have it for awhile. A few months ago I ran out and decided to see if it was on Amazon never imagining it actually was. I was so pleasantly suprised to find it here. Now I never have to worry about running out again! My son and I use this product to sprinkle on stew, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese and macaroni salad. It adds a nice flavor and texture. It is a staple in my life just as much as pepper or ketchup.

I am NOT a doctor.  I am just telling you what works for me (and I have told many friends about this secret.)<br /><br />For "D,"  I take one teaspoon and chew it up.  It is very dry.  I drink some water with it to get it down.  I wait 30 minutes and repeat.  I have found it to stop the "D" without stopping the need to get rid of waste.  It just makes things solid.  That way, you are still getting rid of what needs to go, without all the cramping and running and misery.<br /><br />The Honey Crunch has more flavor than the plain and a slightly sweet taste.  I ALWAYS keep some in my home.  Sometimes I even throw an unopened jar in the suitcase when I am traveling--just in case, unless there is a food store nearby.  Of course, if you have a wheat allergy, don't use it.

review/text: The stores around here quit carrying Honey Crunch Wheatgerm, so I turned to the great Amazon. Because I've got to have my Honey Crunch Wheatgerm fix in the mornings! I use it on cereal, yogart, toast with peanut butter. It adds crunch and more nutrition without altering the taste too much. What would I do without it--and so what would I do without Amazon?

I'm relieved that, for now anyway, I can find a source of supply online. With fruit and juice it makes a wonderful lite breakfast that is good for you.

review/summary: Product is exceptional, shipping charges are insane.
review/text: I've always loved Kretschmer Honey Crunch Wheatgerm, not only from the standpoint of nutrition, but the taste, too.  I put it on everything I eat!!  From peanut butter sandwiches to yogurt to a bowl of cereal to ice cream.  It's just yummy.  I had start buying it online because a lot of grocery stores stopped stocking it.  However, every place I looked online (including here) charged the same amount for shipping that it charged for the product itself which, in effect, meant that I would be paying twice the amount for it than normal.  I just didn't think it was worth the extra bucks, but recently while shopping for a friend, I discovered that the really big Albertsons markets still DO stock it, so I am once again a very happy consumer.

review/summary: Will be a loyal customer for life (my cat's life that is)
review/text: My cat was biting at himself and leaving open wounds all over his body. After many trips to the vet, prescription Hill's Z/D low-allergen food stopped his itchiness, irritation and self-mutilation. However, at $60 a pop (10lb), I wanted to try alternatives. A couple types of food from the local pet store made him return to his previous behavior so I ordered this online based on the positive reviews. I have been feeding him this for 2 years and he has shown no problems since. His sister is forced to eat it as well but she seems to like it just fine. In my experience this food is a good alternative to Hill's Z/D prescription food at one-third the price.<br /><br />Update: May my little buddy rest in peace. He had urinary blockage which took his life at age 4. No way to know if the Natural Balance food played any part. His sister age 13 who has been eating it is still very healthy and happy. I believe he was prone to health issues in general and I still stand by this brand, but I crowdsource this info in case others discover the same result.

review/summary: So far so great!
review/text: My poor cat has terrible allergies and even the more expensive varieties of Diamond cat food would give him digestive problems so the vet recommended Science Diet Prescription d/d Venison & Green Pea Formula.  It did work, but the cost was extreme!  After doing some research I came across this cat food and it was much cheaper, by almost half, but would it work?  It's been at least a month since my cat started eating it and so far it's worked very well and doesn't seem to make him as bloated as the Science Diet.  All in all, this is a good product and I plan to buy it again.

review/summary: Finally! A cat food that my allergic cat can eat!
review/text: Just about every dry cat food on the market has chicken in it. After months of dealing with a cat who was scratching himself bloody and hurling his cookies all over the place, it was determined that he is allergic to chicken. Thus began the search for something that both my cats could eat that could be tolerated by the allergic one.<br /><br />After having to replace a couple of wireless keyboards that my allergy boy barfed into, I discovered Natural Balance Green Pea and Duck Formula. Voila! As long as he is confined to eating only this formula, he's fine. No scratching. No more minefields of cat barf to navigate in the middle of the night. Whew!<br /><br />Amazon's got a good price on it too. So I'm a happy camper.

review/summary: Quality is evident and price is nice
review/text: I'm not kidding when I say this food LITERALLY smells good. As in, human-food good. Cats were a little picky at first; I'm fairly confident it was because of the high protein content. However, a few days in, they were eating it, and additionally, my fat cat gets full on less of it than the carb-loaded ones from the grocery store. Time will tell if it addresses the vile smelling poo of my other cat. The alternatives are much more expensive e.g., Royal Canin, at more than twice the price for a lighter bag. Its protein, fat, fiber, and moisture are all within 1.5% of Royal Canin's as well. Considering the ingredients, it's quite the bargain.

review/text: I began feeding Natural Balance Green Pea & Duck several years ago when we suspected food allergies.  My 5 year old calico LOVES this formula!  I've tried mixing it up from time to time, as is sometimes suggested when dealing with sensitivities, by buying the salmon or chicken variety of this food.  She will eat those, but seems to prefer the duck.  Upon the advice of my vet, she gets a small serving of the wet food each day, supplemented by the kibble.  Her coat is THICK and shiny, she has a good activity level, and is healthy as can be.

review/summary: one cats loves it, two kinda like it
review/text: our cats don't have allergies or need to lose weight anymore.  no serious health probs but they do tend towards constipation so the vet suggested duck and pea food.  we started with the expensive stuff for one of the cats and left the other two on their old chicken and corn low-cal food to use it up.  i really wanted all three on the same food so when we realized three pets on duck and pea would be pricey we decided to try natural balance instead of royal canin.  cat #1 went from the royal canin to this new food very fast.  we tried to introduce it slowly but he was picking out the natural balance and leaving the royal canin in the dish!  he had a few loose stools but after a couple days things looked good.  in our house, a soft poopie is a good poopie, better than those dried up little cow-paddy looking grainy stools from the corn food.  cats #2 and #3 took a few days to get used to this duck and pea, probably because the old chicken and corn smelled more meaty and less vegetable-y.  at first they picked out their old food and left the duck and pea.  we didn't want to give in, so we sort of hand fed them the new stuff and praised them a lot for a few days when they ate it, petting them while they were eating, and now they've pretty much forgotten about the old food!  tiny walnut-brains...  if they're hungry enough, they'll eat. yes, their stools do smell a bit more strong but that is not a bad thing, i've decided.  hopefully we won't get a bad batch of food in the future or one of the cats gets bored of this stuff, cause i really like all of them on the same food now.  they seem energetic and healthy still, two of them at 10 years old, and we'll just keep monitoring their intake so they don't put weight back on.  i don't think it's the food so much as the amt. that matters when it comes to weight.  a woman at our vet office swears by natural balance and i'm glad we listened to her.

review/summary: Kitties will not eat it.
review/text: I feed my cats Solid Gold Indigo Moon but Petco was out of it and I picked up a bag of this in the meantime. My cats will not eat it. They simply turned up their noses. And I am talking about three tubby cats who attack my salads and drink cranberry juice if they can get it. So I picked up a piece of kibble and decided to do a taste test. I know y'all will be like ewwwww but I like to know what my cats are eating. I have tossed out several brands of cat food because just by tasting them I realized what a ridiculous amount of salt they were adding to their formula. Compared to Solid Gold, this food tastes like nothing. There is no flavor. Solid Gold has a definite meaty flavor to it while this tastes like dry unflavored cereal. Luckily Petco took the opened bag back and I bought my fluffies Solid Gold again. They loooove Solid Gold and it is a no-salt, no-grain, no-artificial dye formula but for some reason it gives two of my cats smelly/runny poo. I am thinking of transitioning to Blue Buffalo because of the lifesource bits that contain dried enteric bacteria.

review/text: I have a cat who is allergic to just about everything and every meat in normal cat foods on the market.  Our vet put him on Hill's Prescription Diet DD-Venson and Green Pea. ($45/bag)  This was getting VERY expensive because he continued to have skin out-brakes and I had vet bills of $200+/mo.  I did not have the heart to put him down because he was less than two years old and he was not really in any pain.  In reading about his illness, I found Natural Balance LID as an alternative and decided to try it.  He has been on it for three months and has not had any serious out brakes.  This is the best cat food for the money!!

review/text: Our cats are, at various levels of severity, allergic to the regular dry foods.  We'd been feeding them raw chicken for the last year or so, but it had gotten a bit too messy and time consuming, especially because one or two of them never really took to it.  We decided to try the duck formula and after a week they have all remained as full of energy as they had on a raw diet.  This food has actually helped increase the fullness of their coats and has helped heal their dry and itchy skin.

review/summary: Works for my allergic cat and the price is right
review/text: I was feeding my 3 cats with the expensive Innova brand, thinking to avoid the pet food scare from not long ago. They liked it and for awhile everything was fine. Then one of my cats started having a reaction; she kept scratching her face and eventually made a bloody bald patch. I took her to the vet and he was immediately able to identify it as food allergy (red spots in the ear canal was another indicator). I searched on Amazon for allergy sensitive food and this popped up. I didn't want to have to feed my 3 cats separately, so I was planning to make them all convert to the new food. Thankfully they all love this food and with Amazon's awesome pricing, it's actually cheaper than the Innova food I was previously buying. I highly recommend this brand and ingredients for allergy sensitive cats.<br /><br />Now if only Amazon offered it as a Subscribe & Save, everything would be perfect *hint hint*.

review/text: After feeding my cats friskies for two years, I grew concerned over the quality of their food. One cat became morbidly obese, while the other had dull fur and little energy. I did research on grain free foods and switched over to wellness core for a while, but that gave my older cat a urinary tract infection due to high vitamin c content. So I switched them over to this formula to see how it is, and it's wonderful! My cats are happy, healthy, and full of energy. It's also much cheaper than wellness and only slightly more expensive than friskies. So worth it!

review/summary: Great for cats with and without food allergies
review/text: One of our cats suffers from eosinophilic granuloma complex, which is a food allergy that would cause him to get lesions on his gums, nose, and skin.  Once it was diagnosed by the vet, switching him over to Royal Canin Veterinary Diet Green Pea and Duck formula did the trick and his flare-ups went away, but it costs around $60 for an 8.8 lb bag and you can only buy with with a prescription.  A few months later we discovered the Natural Balance LID Green Pea and Duck Formula and tried it, and it works just the same for keeping our cat's allergic reactions away.  And on top of that, it's only $21.49 for the 10 lb bag from Amazon - roughly 1/3 the cost (and Prime shipping is great)!<br /><br />We recently switched our other two cats over to this food as well at the suggestion of the vet (a different one), who said that it is lower fat than some of the other normal cat foods we were feeding them and we wanted to watch their weight (one was already on Blue Buffalo Weight Control, which is also more expensive than this stuff).<br /><br />This food has a great nutrition profile and is very healthy and high quality.  It's perfect for cats both with and without food allergies.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: what a difference!
review/text: One of my cats has bad diabetes so we switched them all to a mixture of diabetic friendly wet food and this NB dry food. The difference between this and the premium store cat food like iams and purina is astronomical! I use a considerable amount less as this fills their bellies fast and lasts them longer! All of them seem more vibrant and playful and no one throws up anymore (unless they have eaten too fast). It's still more expensive even though I don't have to use as much but its well worth the price when I see them so healthy! I tried several other dry foods (including prescription) before this one and although others worked well, this one is the cheapest high quality dry food I have found that works so well with my cat's tummies and none of them complain about having to eat it (as they have with other high quality brands)!<br /><br />Try it out, your cats will love it!

review/text: I've bought the Natural Balance salmon and green pea and chicken and green pea, but this one is their favorite.  I'll put out a bowl of chicken and green pea and the duck and green pea, and the chicken and green pea sits there until the duck is gone and they are hungry enough to eat it!

review/summary: Finally, no more diarrhea!
review/text: Got this for a kitten who has had diarrhea for 7 months. We had tried four other foods--Two science diet from vet, two that were free of soy, corn or wheat; none worked. He had been on antibiotics+Benebac, prednisone, an anti-inflammatory that is also a chemo drug (kinda scary) and had surgery to see if he had cancer. This seems to be working! Still don't know WHAT he is allergic to, but this food seems to be good for him. My other cat eats it fine, too.

review/summary: Try a smaller amount first to see if your cat will eat it
review/text: I'm sure this is a quality product and there are alot more positive reviews than negative but I would suggest if you've never tried this product before, to get a smaller amount and see if your cat will take to it.  My cat eats ANYTHING that I previously would put before her but with this product, she progressively started eating less and less of it to the point where I now have half of the bag left and she won't touch it at all - and it's not like this is the only thing I feed her.  I give her a variety of wet and dry food and I often give her whatever I cook up for myself whether it is chicken or fish or fresh vegetables, she'll eat anything but she won't touch this dried food anymore.

review/summary: good but pricey
review/text: I was a little surprised by the problems experienced by Soulwriterchick per her review. Four adult cats in our house, two with sensitive gut or skin, have been eating this stuff for two months. They like it (after several tentative days) as well as the similar-quality (but too expensive) "Halo Spot's Stew Natural Dry Cat Food." Their preference for this food is the same as their preference for the much cheaper (by the 20-lb bag) Iams Adult Active Maturity. Natural Balance has better ingredients, though. Comparing these 3 products with Science Diet: They like the new Science Diet Age Defying Senior Dry Cat Food best by flavor (costs almost as much as Halo) BUT the Science Diet foods have ingredients no better in quality than the far cheaper IAMS and the cats, all of them, eat far too much of the Science Diet (or act like they're starving), making it the least economical of the bunch. It's clear the "scientists" at Science Diet have developed some kind of kittie-cocaine. grrr.<br /><br />update:  after another month of use, I find the gang, after getting used to the non-standard taste, have migrated to this dry food and have not been eating as much of the IAMS or a sensitive-cat Purina product. They also like the Halo product a lot now.<br /><br />5-month Update:  A recent emotional blow for the cats, losing their older brother, seems to have made them very fussy about food. I had also made the mistake of giving them some canned food a few months back--a BIG mistake. Anyhow, at present, they are refusing to eat this Natural Balance Dry food. It is good stuff. I just have to figure out how to get them back on track.

review/summary: Great cat food
review/text: My two cats love this food.  One of them had a suspected gluten allergy - he would lick himself to the point of forming bald spots - and after a few months of switching food, his hair has almost all grown back in.

review/summary: cleared up chronic diarrhea overnight
review/text: My cat suffered from chronic diarrhea for years. I tried blood tests, antibiotics, nutritional supplements, and every variety of cat food on the market. Finally I tried this one and it worked overnight -- no more diarrhea. It is truly a miracle worker!
