review/text: After 40 years of taking many brands of Brewers yeast regularly and recommending it to anyone who would listen, I never expected to find a forumlation that is comletely unpalatable. The taste of this brand is so foul, the manufacturer should be ashamed to put their label on it!

review/summary: IF IT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD IT IS HARD TO GET PEOPLE TO ADD IT TO THEIR FOOD OR DRINKS
review/text: SEEMS LIKE THEY FORGOT TO DEBITTER THIS OTHERWISE EXCELLENT PRODUCT<br /><br />While I have found one can get use to the awful taste of this particular brand of Brewer's Yeast, other brands, such as Twin Labs offer a more palatable product for less. This is the only "NOW" product to date that has been a disappointment. In essence, what good is it if it ruins the taste of anything you put it in. I can stand it, but the rest of my family typically stops taking Brewer's Yeast until I get the Twin Labs product. I would have given it 4 stars, since after all it is a terrific food supplement, [just with an awful taste], except it is uncharacteristically expensive compared to the "NOW" brands usual high value at very reasonable cost.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY]

review/summary: A vegetarian Slim Jim
review/text: I grew up eating meat and switched to vegetarian about 10 years ago.  My cravings for a nice smoked sausage still remains.  I found these Primal Spirit Meatless Sticks on Amazon and took my chances.  Usually a vegetarian product trying to imitate meat falls far short when it comes to texture.  These have the texture of a Slim Jim and have a nice spice to them.  Since ordering them, I have also ordered several other of the Primal Spirit products.  These are, by far, my favorites.  They scratch that itch for us one-time meat eaters.

The size, 1.5 ounce is perfect as well, not too big, not too small.

review/text: I have bought and enjoyed the other Primal products, so I thought that I would give these a whirl. Overall flavor is not bad, I just find these dry and kind of blah. They do not have the intense flavor of the Primal jerkies. I suppose the other thought is that perhaps different lots or batches of these products are better than others, who knows what the quality control in Taiwan is comprised of? These items are very difficult to open without a knife or scissors, so don't plan on opening away from home. Overall they seem a bit too dry, they actually break apart as you try to remove them from the package. Pros: Another Veggie option for us. Cons: Hard to open, only okay flavor and a bit on the dry side.

review/text: These Primal Spirit Meatless Sticks are vegetarian and delicious.  They have a sweet pepperoni favor (I haven't tried the smoked favor yet).  They are almost a foot long and � inch across.  Contrary to what some reviewers are saying, the sticks I got are moist and soft, not dry and chalky.  Perhaps I was just lucky.  They taste and have a texture just like their meat counterparts.  That proves vegetarians can eat well and show compassion to hapless animals at the same time.

review/text: I love the primal strips jerky, and when I saw these I thought even if they didn't taste anything like pepperoni they would still be good.  I was wrong.  The flavor profile is off, the texture so dry you need glasses and glasses of water just to eat half of one strip. I even tried eatig one after the gym and then it was only palatable, not good.  Since we bought a box, we're going to save the rest for hikes and back-packing. But I wouldn't advise gettig unless u like the texture of tree bark.

review/summary: BLECH!
review/text: These would be great if it weren't for the awful taste and texture. :P<br />The texture lacks any sort of stringy interior or snappy exterior that would make these similar to a Slim Jim. Instead, the texture just has this kind of grainy, mushy-yet-firm thing going on. I could forgive that with no problems if it weren't for the downright awful taste. The closest thing I can think of to compare it to would be cardboard with lots of black pepper in it. I'd rather eat plain tofu than these sticks. I don't know how Primal Spirit managed to mess these up so bad when their other stuff is so good. I highly recommend getting Primal Spirit Meatless Jerky instead of Primal Spirit Meatless Flavor Sticks. They are two completely different products.

The texture was not bad though they break easily.  Since I used to eat meat (about eight years or so ago) I know what a meat stick would normally taste like.  This is not it.  It may be the slight sweet taste throwing it off, I'm not sure.  Now I have another 23 sticks left to figure it out I guess.

review/summary: Ken's Steak House Raspberry Walnut Vinaigrette is VinaiGREAT! Absolutely delicious.
review/text: First, let me start of by saying that if you don't like other vinaigrette dressings, you're not going to like this one either. It's still made primarily with oil and vinegar. Some people can't stand the way it tastes on a salad, much preferring the creamy dressings. (Which have their place.) But if you like vinaigrettes in general, and raspberry vinaigrette in particular, then this stuff is freakin' spectacular. It has a nice sweet fruity flavor, but almost no sugar. It has that vinegar zip and zing, but not overwhelmingly so. A little bit coats a LOT of lettuce, and it's so delicious that I often find myself surprised by the fact that it has so few calories. This stuff is so good, I'm able to stick to my salad and soup diet, and lost 93 pounds when I first started, which was before I got sick. Since I got sick, I've lost a LOT of weight, but I STILL stick to this dietary plan because the dressing is so good.<br />  Another nice twist, though it has a bit more calories, is Ken's Raspberry Pecan dressing. I've been unable to find it here on Amazon, but my local store carries it. Their other vinaigrette's are just as delicious, though this raspberry walnut remains my favorite. (Another good one is: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00374WLNU">Ken's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette - 6 Pack</a>) Again, if you like vinaigrette dressing in general, then this is one of the best ones I've ever tasted. Ken's makes a pretty good line of dressing, whether you're in the market for the vinaigrette's, or just looking for some pretty darn good Ranch. (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MZ2GZW">Kens Ranch Dressing (Case of 60)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00436SF7C">Kens Fat Free Ranch (box of 60)</a>) If you're looking for a vinaigrette that's a cut above the rest, then give this stuff a try. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Thanks for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell

review/summary: Its not bad, just not on its on.
review/text: I purchased this for a quick to eat lunch stand alone. The rice itself is really sticky and kind of gummy and has no real taste. The addition of seasonings and toppings might help, but I havn't come up with the right combination yet. Eaten alone with a bit of salt is by all means managable, and is thus far where I am with the rice.

review/summary: Good or bad?
review/text: First I must say this arrived very swiftly with the student amazon prime. As a college student, I love the ease of this and how filling it seems at 2 in the morning. The issue is with the taste. I don't know either I like it or not. Bits are gummy and bits are a little hard. The aftertaste is so much better than the present taste. It's sour and not the best of taste but the after taste is sweet and cooling.

review/summary: The Best Rice Ever!
review/text: This has a rich, nutty taste, nice and moist, and wonderfully sticky--does really well with tossing some sauteed chunks of chicken breast,  and fresh baby spinach; adding other spices or not.  Great plain with just a drop or two sesame oil or olive oil.  Or as a sweet breakfast cereal with milk and a dash of sweetener or fruit of some kind.  Has the same versatility that all rice has.  Nice for those of us who either don't like spending time in the kitchen, or those needing just one or two servings at a time.

review/text: Hi! I bought the 6-pack from Warehouse Deals. Rice needed sauce to bring up the flavor. Perhaps because rice was nearer to expiration date some flavor has been lost over time. Otherwise, this item is easy to prepare. 1 minute in microwave and done. I would buy again. When package arrived I was out of any Asian style sauce. I put bar-b-que sauce on the rice. Tasted okay. A healthy food choice. I am very satisfied with this product.

review/text: I purchased this rice on a whim because I'd never heard of black rice.  When the box arrived, my kids declared they wouldn't eat black rice, so it sat in the cabinet for a few weeks.  I had some leftovers for lunch one day and needed a little side dish so I took this to work with me.  It was delicious!! I love how easy it is.  Just peel back the cover and microwave for 1 minute. The texture is a bit like couscous or something.  Hard to describe.  The flavor is great.  I am now kind of glad that my kids won't eat it because it's a little something special just for me!

Prepare the rice as per the directions, add 1-2 tablespoons of sugar (to taste) and a touch of pandan flavor (vanilla or coconut if you don't have pandan) and a tablespoon or two of coconut milk.

review/text: It would be this rice.  I can't compare this to any other Black Pearl rices because I've never had them.  It's tasty to me and the connivence is amazing.  Honestly on a really lazy day I would probably eat this with a little butter and call it a meal.  Right now, I'm eating half with other items.  It's blending really well with my other foods. Amazing for portion control, amazing for a single person, amazing to add to a plate to get a complete meal in no time at all.  I'm looking forward to using this in a can of soup come fall and winter.

review/text: I didn't look closely enough at the description of the rice packaging.  I thought from the photo it would be in a pouch... but instead it's in a bowl with a cardboard sleeve around the bowl.  Granted, most of it is recyclable, but it's WAY too much packaging to be environmentally  friendly, especially when buying a multi-pack.<br />So even though we enjoyed the rice, and found it convenient, I won't be purchasing it again.

review/text: This is a high quality cumin at a very reasonable price. I use a lot of ground cumin, and this is clearly the best for the price. Unlike many preground cumins, Tone's activates and blossoms very well if tossed into hot olive oil with crushed garlic which eliminates the need to grind your own seeds to get this effect. If you're using it in stews, hold back half for the last half hour of cooking. Great flavor!

review/summary: Wonderful flavour and GINORMOUS in size.
review/text: I was surprised how huge this bottle is. It's far bigger than I expected, I must say: it's gonna last me a year (and I love this flavour and use it every day everywhere... this and turmeric, with me, they do not last long).<br /><br />The bottle came very carefully packed in a box with plastic bladders for protection, and the cover was carefully taped over (even though the bottle has a usual paper-and-foil impermeable seal underneath the cover, a quite sturdy one). Such care and mindfulness on behalf of the maker made a good impression on me.<br /><br />And then, of course, the stuff itself: it's great -- obviously fresh: fragrant and still moist (you can see the powder clump together a bit). Wonderful stuff. Now, the best cumin I know of in stores is McCormick's. So let's see, it's about two bucks an ounce, whereas this thing here is 0.75. Great-tasting cumin -- and a steal too, can you beat that? Thanks to the maker; I'll be back.<br /><br />Bottom line: very highly recommended.<br /><br />PS. Watch the prices. I got it for about twelve bucks; now it's higher. Moreover, a few days back I was browsing in my local Indian store (where I buy turmeric and other similar things) and discovered they sell ground cumin for four bucks a pound. One has to marvel at how these little mom-and-pop stores manage to offer a better assortment of better quality produce at a fraction of the cost of similar stuff in large stores, including online. You'd think online prices will be best, but they're not. Watch out.

review/text: While we certainly enjoy Pamela's chocolate cake, this vanilla cake is exceptional.  I always add to my recipes; just can't seem to let them be, so I add an extra egg or some sour cream or some organic grated coconut with some coconut or almond flavoring and this just can't be beat. Frost it with the vanilla frosting to which organic grated coconut has been added or the dark chocolate frosting and watch it disappear!! I am surprised that some cooks have found a poor texture.  This always turns out perfectly and I am a high altitude baker (Colorado Springs).  I do use coconut oil instead of butter; maybe that is the difference.

review/summary: Okay, but don't expect too much
review/text: The Pamela's Products chocolate cake is heaven.  This vanilla cake is... well, bearable if you have to eat GF food.  Honestly, there are many GF recipes out there to make a sponge cake from scratch that taste way better, so if you don't have to have this product, make your own or buy the chocolate one.  This cake is tough and chalky (and yes, I've made it several times and followed all the instructions). It also has a faintly bitter, salty flavor that gives it an unpleasant aftertaste.  The chocolate cake can pass for a wheat cake with my non-Celiac friends, but this one is easily recognizable as GF. Maybe if it was modified with other ingredients/flavors as other reviewers have commented, then it might taste better.  As a plain white cake, though, it's just not great.

review/summary: Yes!!
review/text: Yes! This is it! I have recently had to go gluten free by doctors orders. I was fine with this as I had experimented somewhat in gf cooking in the past. I knew baking could be tricky though, and have had bad luck baking gf mixes before. I learned to rely on recipes that had their own previously tried and tested flour mix formulas. My husband asked for a gf carrot cake for his birthday (so I could eat it too). I panicked when I realized I no longer had my gf carrot cake recipe and could remember which flours in which proportions to use. I tried Pamelas for the first time and followed the carrot cake variation on the package.(added some nutmeg to it too). I also got her frosting and added cream cheese. It was phenomenal! So easy, and so delicious. I don't know what the reviewers who said the texture and flavor was off are talking about. It was just as good if not BETTER than a run of the mill gluten flour based cake.<br /><br />So glad I found this. Will definitely be trying the company's other products.

review/summary: A little spongy
review/text: The flavor on these is good but the texture, as prepared according to the classic vanilla cake direction, is a bit spongier than a wheat based cake. It's actually almost too sweet for a cake with butter cream icing but I think it might make a great muffin with blueberries or some other fruit added.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Natural Evaporated Cane Sugar, Tapioca Starch, White Rice Flour, Potato Starch, Chicory Root, Sea Salt, Grainless & Aluminum Free Baking Powder (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate, Potato Starch), Organic Vanilla Powder (contains corn derivative), Rice Bran, Gluten-free Natural Vanilla Powder (contains corn derivative), Xanthan Gum.<br /><br />I probably would buy this again if I had to be 100% gluten free. (I was looking for a way to reduce the amount of wheat I eat but I do not have outright wheat or gluten allergies.) The directions for turning this into a carrot cake do look pretty good though and I'll probably give it another try prepared that way.<br /><br />The directions do call for eggs to prepare this so it would not be vegan or for those who have egg allergies.

review/summary: Pamela's just doesn't make a bad product
review/text: I am a sworn from-scratch baker. With the possible exception of the Bacardi rum cake I used to make every Christmas when I was a teenager, this was the first cake mix I have ever used in my life. I bought it because it was on sale at the local store and I won the Pamela's vanilla frosting mix in a giveaway, so I thought what the heck.... Well, my husband, who is not gluten free and not a "cake person" ate a huge piece of this with ice cream and claimed it was the best cake he has ever tasted in his life.<br /><br />I made it according to package directions but used four eggs instead of three (the package says to do this if you want a fluffier cake). I also added extra vanilla extract. The cake was moist and fluffy and amazing. I am so impressed. I may have to do Subcribe & Save on this one. So much for from-scratch baking.<br /><br />The frosting mix worked nicely too, by the way, although I found it got airy pockets in it so didn't spread like tub-based frostings, and didn't look as pretty.

review/text: I was expecting this to be delicious based on Pamela's Chocolate cake mix (which is outstanding!). I did find that it had a strange taste (can't quite tell what it is) and it was very strong. I also found that I had to bake it for 15-20 minutes longer than the directions said, even though I followed the mixing directions precisely. The texture wasn't the greatest either, but it was flavor of the cake that put me off. I will not be buying this again, and it was a very disappointing experience. Too bad because Pamela's other gluten free products are pretty awesome.

review/summary: Excellent taste--are you sure there's no gluten?
review/text: We have tried every cake mix product there is that is gluten free, since my spouse (in his forties) has been gluten-intolerant his whole life.  We have come a long way since he was a kid (and even since I started baking for him 20 years ago), and finally we are getting some mixes that actually taste like the glutinous versions (in a good way).  This one is not grainy, is fluffy, and has a deliciously sweet taste.  It is the best cake from my kids' perspective, too (even my kids who can eat gluten and know what the glutinous cakes can taste like actually prefer this one).  We bought a case of the mix as we love it so much.  We freeze the packages and they last a super long time, baking about one a month on the average throughout the year.  All of us can now enjoy the same delicious cake at the same time, whether on a gluten-free diet or not.  And it bakes great every time (you don't have to be a great baker--just follow the directions).  It's the mix that is phenomenal!

review/summary: Used for coconut cake recipe on the Pamela's Site
review/text: I did not use this mix as just the vanilla cake, but I used it to make the coconut cake recipe that is on the Pamela'e website. We love the chocolate cake mix but this one is not as great. The cupcakes that we made turned out bad and as my brother in law said, it was like eating saw dust. The texture was horrible and we probably will not buy this mix again.

review/summary: disappointing; use Pamela's baking mix instead
review/text: I buy Pamela's gluten -free bread mix, baking mix, and cookie mix and nothing compares! I serve it to all my company, gluten lovers included and they love it all. When I made cake from this mix however, it had a strong gluten-free taste, so I had to add other ingredients to the mix to make it palatable. Even after testing  the cake with different additives, like chocolate, coconut,etc, it still tasted weird. Texture was not good at all. If you're going to make a cake, use Pamela's baking mix. There is a cake recipe on the Pamela's web site for this. It is very good. Don't bother buying this mix.

review/text: I have tried this cake mix 3 times and each time it turned out disgusting.  The texture is rubbery, gummy and a very unusual non-appealing flavor.  My family finally said "please mom don't try it again".  And, I won't! Their chocolate cake is the best by far.  I was told to stick to that one.  Since I have to be on a gluten free diet I was really hoping that this vanilla cake mix would be good.  Unfortuantely it's the most disgusting vanilla cake I've ever had.  Even tried disguising the taste with vanilla pudding and fresh berries.  Didn't make it.  The awful taste of the cake was front and center.  My recommendation - Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Never knew a tea could taste this good
review/text: Its pricey, true. but after trying over a dozen other lower priced teas, and others that were only lower because of a pre purchased certificate, I decided it was less expensive just to buy what I wanted than try to save.  If I didnt think it was a good value in the long run, I would have had to go with 4 not 5 stars, no matter how much I love it.  But it earns that last star when you get down to it.  I first tasted this at a mall walking by a teavana shop.<br /><br />I was so dazed that this was a tea I was tasting...it just didnt seem real.  I didnt buy any that day, and kept hurrying to my destinatation.  Later I couldnt get it out of my head, and finally went back to be sure, and to buy it.<br /><br />then i went shopping around.  I can usually find things for waaaay below retail, without sacrificing quality.  But not with this.  I wasted a couple of hundred dollars on less expensive blends with no luck.  Eventually I found one that was a close second.  But the same was true in price... other than a prepaid half off certificate I had for that store.<br /><br />I was almost "enchanted" by the runner up.  But once I tried the Teavana again, the other just wasnt in the same district.  It was just too floral.  The teavana tea is more delicate and balanced. If I ever find a deal like that again, I'll try the other tea for use in blending with the distant third place winners.  If even the youthberry is a bit floral for you, tevana sells a lighter blended version with orange.<br /><br />But for me , by itself in the youthberry, you taste each flavor as a separate note, fruity, warm, then aromatically fragrant. I know they say taste is mostly smell.  I actually smell the roses more than taste them... Then at either the beginning or the end of the sip (or so I found, varying by whether hot or cold, may not be there at all for you) there is a brief moment when the notes make a chord or perhaps symphony.  All too short, leaving you wanting more, but at the same time, perfectly filled.<br /><br />If I sound like I'm reviewing a wine..  I have had that pleasure, and I think out of the hundreds of wines I tried, including most of the wines considered among the finest, I never enjoyed a wine more than this tea for flavor.  And at almost no calories!<br /><br />Then again, once I had to pay for the wines myself..for some reason my love for them waned. This tea is one of the few things I think is worth paying retail for.<br /><br />If you hate all things floral, including the scent of flowers, perfume etc...this isnt for you.  I dont know many who do, other than allergically.<br /><br />This is like drinking a cup of sweet fruit tea while visiting a fine florist.  sitting in a garden, or holding a rose.  But somehow it isnt girly, unless you want it to be.  I just found something totally new and different for me when I tasted it, and it was an unexpected pleasure that brought me into the tea afficiando world like never before.  I only like herbals I make myself usually.<br /><br />Oh the other two of my 4, had nothing in common with this, were just herbals I picked up to qualify for free shipping in hopes of finding something I could tolerate that had the benefit of some of the herbs within.  I actually found two I like for two things I knew I should either drink or eat, but hated the taste.<br /><br />The youthberry may have beneficial things in it.  (In fact it does, or so my herbal books say of the ingredients) but its a drink for pure pleasure.  I recently had to give up all forms of soda. diet or not, and was using tea for a flavor substitute.  It didnt really do the job, until I found this.  I like it better than the soda and dont miss it at all now.  I really only switch out from the youthberry for plain water, or something I need the benefit of, and to cleanse my taste buds to go back to this.  Leaves easily yeild two batches of water. I find that adding only about 25% as much I can stretch that to 4 or 5.  In the long run, I'm actually saving money vs soda.

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: So, some friends said this was the best tea ever.  As a tea lover, I thought I would give it a shot.  First, the tea leaves and bits of fruit and what not, are large.  It's probably best to brew this tea loose in a small pot and strain it into a cup to let the flavors really develop.  However, for the size of the tea product the flavor was not very strong.  I have never been to a Teavana shop, but apparently they really sweeten the teas they serve.  I used a little agave for mine and I found it to be just OK.  In summary, not the best tea ever, but not bad, it certainly beats Lipton by a mile.  It's also costs a lot more than Lipton...so, there's that.  As for shipping, my products arrived quickly and safely packaged.

review/text: This is definitely an acquired taste.  You will either like it or hate it.  In my family only I and one of my 3 kids like it.  We like it more than peanut butter and only eat it on sandwiches.  I like it with a dark purple or red jelly, more subtle jellies like apple or orange marmalade just didn't work.  As the other reviewer stated it is dark green and very easy to spread.  If you are worried about addiction don't be.  My preschooler and I ate it 4-5 times a week for a month ( We ate about 1 can every 2 weeks) and when the store ran out and we stopped eating it for a while neither of us had any reaction.  Some other parents had weird reactions to the concept of hemp but I know it is healthy, legal and much better for you than peanut butter or sandwich meat so I ignored their looks.

Health food stores sell Hemp seed butter for way more. I used this nut butter with a sliver of honey on my toast and it was great. If eaten by itself, it surely does not taste good. I will buy again primarily due to the benefits of nut protein.

The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game.

Japanese tea drinkers have been using stevia for years with no ill effects she said.  It's quite a bit sweeter than sugar, so you need less of it as a replacement.<br /><br />I like this brand and put two packets in my iced coffee every morning with almond milk and 1 T cocoa--it tastes like a coffee milk shake for only about 70 calories as the Stevia is calorie-free! The stevia makes it taste like an iced dessert drink and is a great, refreshing treat for the day.<br /><br />This multi-pack offer for this price is about 30% lower than what I can get NuStevia for locally.

review/text: Was delighted to be able to taste Euromild after discovering it was recommended for acid-related health issues. It is indeed "mild" but to be fair it is probably just a bit boring for all that!  Having been a black coffee drinker of the french roast persuasion for years until I found the acidity of regular coffee too challenging for my bladder, I was eager to find a good substitute. I would certainly recommend it to coffee fans who miss their java, but don't expect the deep rich flavor the "old grind" used to give you.  In my opinion, it is worth the trade off for bladder comfort!

review/summary: Mexican Coke Cola 12 pack review
review/text: It tastes great. Made with real sugar, not high fructose corn syrup. So this is healthier compare to the American Coke Cola but still don't drink too much of this stuff. I give this pack a 10 out of 10.

review/summary: Mexican Coca Cola
review/text: I was SO looking forward to the taste of "real" Coke with sugar<br />(not corn syrup).  Alas, the Coke was somewhat "flat" so I could<br />not get the true flavor.  All 12 bottles.

review/summary: This rating is for the shipping cost, not the product itself
review/text: As the title says, please consider that this is more of a comment on the shipping cost, not the product itself.  For the record, I'd rate the product at 5 star, I don't know if it's just the use of sugar over corn syrup, or if the formula is a bit different, but these I feel taste much better then corn syruped based coca cola classing in the USA.<br /><br />Anyway, I was going to order these, since sugar based Coke and Pepsi both are sometimes hard to get in my area, and their price per bottle is a lot cheaper then the other resellers here.  Until I saw that the shipping was a good $26.00 or so, at least as of March 21, 2012.  So, the REAL price is about $37.00 or so.  Yes, I do understand that 12-12 ounce bottles is heavy.  BUT, one can get, including shipping, 24 bottles of the exact same product for only about 10 dollars more from one reseller here, albeit one has to be an amazon.com prime subscriber.  Still, with the shipping this goes from a decent deal for ordering soda pop online to a terrible one, even for mexican coke made with sugar IMO.

review/summary: DESERVES 10 STARS, IF IT WAS AVAILABLE!
review/text: YES, YES, YES !!!<br /><br />Recommend this, even if you are someone NOT watching your sodium intake.  I even make sure I keep this in my car for whenever I eat out at some restaurant--much, much better than any other kind of salt combinations or spices.  Wish the BACON SALT people would see about getting their product into places like: LONGHORN STEAK HOUSE, CHILI's, APPLEBEES, BOB EVANS, OLIVE GARDEN, FUDDRUCKERS, etc.  People would be placing orders for it like crazy!<br /><br />Thanks, BACON SALT dudes!
