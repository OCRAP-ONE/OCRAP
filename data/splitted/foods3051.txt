review/summary: Almost what I was looking for...
review/text: These coffee pods looked like a dream come true, especially at the price offered. However, they are just a bit bigger than the normal pods and I can't brew 2 pods at a time like some of the Senseo brand pods. This basically means i have to brew one pod, and then change out pods again before brewing the other half of my beverage. A bit of a hassle but not obnoxiously so. The actual coffee flavor and strength was top notch, though. Far better than most other pods I have tried thus far. Product came in on time and in good condition. Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.

review/summary: Extremely weak coffee
review/text: I am very disappointed in this coffee.  Generally I use 2 pods for my travel mug; this coffee is so weak I tried stuffing 3 pods into the machine and it' STILL extremely week.  The pods are smaller in size compared to the Senseo or Wolfgang pods but seem stuffed ... just so very unhappy and now have 3 full boxes!

review/text: I cant understand how some reviewers find this coffee weak! In my opinion as a lifelong coffee drinker these pods are bold, strong, but not bitter. Absolutely wonderful! I get these pods with the subscribe and save deal which means at $5 a box of 18 they're also a bargain. I recommend you give them a try and see for yourself. Otherwise you'll be passing up a great cup of coffee.

review/summary: Great coffee for the price
review/text: This coffee has become my morning ritual because in my opinion it is the best coffee pod for the price out there, though I haven't tried the other Melitta roasts (those are next on my list). It is so dark and rich, with a chocolate taste and a great body- reminds me of a good Americano (blows a Starbucks Americano out of the water). I've found the best method to getting the best out of this pod is to brew it using about 7 ounces of water with my BUNN MC pod brewer, on the 'tea' setting. This makes a very strong brew, so I add about 2 or 3 ounces of hot water to round it out. My only complaint about these pods is the consistency. It seems like I get a bad, bitter tasting pod here and there. There is also kind of a dry aftertaste. But in all honesty, it could be something I'm not doing right in the brewing process. I'm only taking off one star since I don't know what the issue is. Otherwise, I'm very very pleased with this coffee. I've not felt the need to go to a coffee shop since I purchased it. I will definitely be buying again.

Melitta are the first pods that I've found that are the perfect cup. Very good strong cup of coffee.  They are individually wrapped so each retains their freshness.  The Senseo ones are packed all together in one pouch.  And you get 72 pods for a great price w/ the subscribe & save.  Much better deal than the K cups.

review/summary: These pods are not designed for Senseo
review/text: After receiving a shipment of four boxes of the "Buzzworthy", not only were only half torn open (inside the individual packages), but the coffee was not brewing correctly.  I called Melitta, as I have used their pods purchased at Walmart in the "soft" packages and they were fine.  (I still think the "Senseo" brands are better, but now mostly unavailable)  Melitta's rep. said these are only designed to be used with their machines.  However, the box is clearly marked "fits all coffee pod brewers".  Amazon quickly issued a refund and Melitta has offered to send one replacement package of replacement pods.  The Melitta rep. said if you checked their website, you would see they are only intended to fit their machines.  I believe the boxes/info. should be more appropriately marked!

review/summary: Does not fit a Senseo Very Well at All
review/text: The coffee is pretty good but it does not fit a Senseo well. The pod is too big for the single pod holder and is too small for the double pod holder. The result for me is I get either a too weak full cup or a too strong half cup. I end up having to turn the machine off about 3/4 through a full cup cycle to get it the way I like it. Granted, it takes 2 Senseo pods to make a good full cup but at least I can make a good full cup without having to guess when to turn the cycle off. I find it puzzling that these guys wouldn't just make their pods in the right size for either a half cup or full cup the way a Senseo was designed.<br /><br />There may be other pod machines out there where these pods work well, but that is not a Senseo.

review/text: This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Sparkling Clementine.  It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book

I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review/text: When I was on amazon one day I had a craving for white chocolate and raspberries. When I saw Raspberry White Chocolate Truffles, I knew I had to get it. I ordered it right before Thanksgiving time. The shipping was pretty good. It arrived when I was expecting it to. I thought the product itself was awesome. I gave some to my brother and sister and really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this product to anybody that loves white chocolate and raspberries.

These bones help keep their teeth healthy and keep them occupied without creating a mess.  Long after the filling is gone they still gnaw on the bones with delight.<br /><br />Makes me happy that these are made in the USA. I think these are great. Try them out for your pup!

review/summary: Contains chicken!
review/text: Why does this bone have to contain chicken meal and poultry flavor???  It's a PEANUT BUTTER bone.  The reason I purchased it is because it was advertised as PEANUT BUTTER.  My dog has a chicken sensitivity and would've gotten the runs like mad had I not read the label before giving it to him.  Rather than return it because the shipping would've cost the same as what I paid for the item, I took the filling out and gave him the plain bone.  I'll refill it with some regular Jiff if need be.  It would've been helpful for the company to disclose the ingredients in these so-called peanut butter flavored things.  Chicken is not peanut butter.

review/text: These sterilized and filled bones are great for heavy chewers.  I raise labs for Guiding Eyes for the Blind and they recommend these bones for all their pups and dogs.  They are safe and give great chewing satisfaction and last nearly forever!  I add peanut butter to them once they are empty when I am leaving the house to give my dog something to make him happy to see me leave.  I have about 8 of them around the house and probably should just throw some away but they last soooo long!!

review/summary: Not bad, but not my favorite for my med-large dog
review/text: My Rottweiler/German Shepherd mix (85 pounds) loved this bone!  He licked all the peanut butter out in about a day, though.  He is still carrying it around, but I imagine within a couple days he'll be bored again.  I tried this bone as an alternative to the messy but meaty mammoth bones.  It wasn't a totally failed experiment...he does like the bone, but the mammoth bones are only a bit more expensive and last ages longer.  This is a nice solid bone, though.  My dog chews through rawhides in less than an hour, so we don't get him anything too soft or it's gone immediately.<br /><br />In short, very hard bone that will last a while, but the filling can be removed very quickly.

review/text: I just fostered a dog a few days ago, and he loves this toy.  It definitely keeps him distracted in his grate when I'm either at school or work.  I would however recommend you keep an eye on your dog when he plays with this.  Mine finds it enjoyable to toss across my hardwood floor which creates a lot of noise and can also scratch the flooring.  Ultimately, I would strongly recommend this for all dogs.  Some treats have a filling that is very sticky and can cause the dog to choke, this dose not, and I don't have to worry about his safety when I'm away from him.

The recommendation was to get him comfortable in my home then have the treatment.  This requires him to be confined in a crate for most of the day for at least a month.  I have been getting him adjusted to the confinement and the Redbarn Filled Bone has been a lifesaver!!! He is kept occupied and challenged for hours.  As I need to I refill the bone and even freeze it to give him even more satisfaction.

She sniffed it and that was all folks..For a 7 month old Labrador Retriever that says a lot to me because my baby can chew through anything. We got through toys almost on a daily bases and then all her chew bones and raw hides don't tend to last as too long either.<br /><br />She has chewed on it a few times but i think its because its been laying around for so long its just something else in the house. I'm not quite sure what the outside part is made of either because it does not seem to be real raw hide.<br /><br />I would definitely not buy again and will not recommend.

review/summary: Lasts a long time for small dogs
review/text: My 7-lb yorkie developed lymphangiectasia which is essentially a protein allergy.  If she eats normal food, her digestive system will reject it all, act up, and she'll basically slowly die.  So she's on a hypoallergenic prescription venison diet, and all things like rawhide and her regular treats are gone.<br />For treats I give her fresh vegetables (no protein) now.<br /><br />She so sadly missed chewing, so I searched high and low for something she COULD have.  The completely inedible chews were of no interest to her and the things she wanted weren't allowed.<br /><br />This was a good compromise.  She's definitely interested in it and wags her tail for it and chews it, but she doesn't make much progress.  The bones basically just get that gnawed-on look.  Anything she's swallowing is too little to harm her.<br /><br />I'm really happy and this will be the only bone she has for the rest of her life.  Thanks N-Bone.<br /><br />For non-sick dogs, it's still a good, flavorful, long-lasting bone.  And for my dog, the only non-rawhide chew she'll take.

Make sure to get the original (not the pupper nutter) for adult dogs. The pupper nutters are much too easy to chew through.<br /><br />I like the 6.5 inch size for my 16 pound dog who likes to chew, but my sisters shih tzu's, who are around 10 pounds prefer the smaller size.

review/summary: finally a bone that provides extended chewing instead of high speed gobbling
review/text: My dog chewed Booda Bimple bones from puppyhood and he LOVED them. He'd chew for what seemed like hours and drift away into a doggy Zen state. Then Booda changed the formula. They made the bones softer and "more digestible" and my dog could eat the largest size in about 10 minutes (he's only 25 pounds!) and the next day it was bad, bad tummy trouble. Instead of chewing pleasure it was gobbling and looking for more. I tried the N-Bone yesterday. I was a little anxious that it would be the same situation, but the N-Bone seems a good bit harder and my dog really had to work at chewing it, which is a good thing. I'm still not sure the N-Bone will last longer than a single chewing session, but at least it didn't get eaten in minutes. I had the package in my briefcase and when my dog passed by, he did a u-turn and started sniffing and pawing at the bag, so I know it is definitely appealing to him.

review/summary: these are great!!!!
review/text: I think Altoids are wonderful, and when I heard that they had them in liquorice you know I had to try them!  These are great.  They have a lovely, mildly spicy flavor, freshen your breath, soothe your sore threat and taste very "natural."  Liquorice is known for its healing and calming properties and I can honestly say that these wonderful candies make me feel happy whenever I eat them.

review/summary: We Love Altoids!!!
review/text: We love these liquorice Altoids!  While they are a very good breath mint, we use them mainly for flavoring our coffee and sometimes, tea.  One, in the bottom of the cup, or a few in the coffee/tea pot makes life more interesting!  Also, good with just a touch of hot cocoa, added along with Altoids, in coffee.  And yes, they are good in hot cocoa, too.  Very inexpensive, easy way to flavor coffee or tea, much cheaper than alternative.  Almost no calories, but big on flavor!  We've used these for decades!

It was great to get them straight from the company.  The little bit of postage is well worth having a good supply.  Delivery is always prompt and the product is always in great shape!

If you're not familiar with the Altoid brand, start with some of the more traditional offerings like cinnamon, spearmint, etc. as an introduction.  If you have a palatte for (black) licorice, these Altoids are for you.

review/summary: HORRAY  !
review/text: Finally Altoids made a most tempting Altoids flavor of liquorice !  I have tried almost all varieties & since liquorice candy is my favorite I tried this and loved it.  Its especially strong  ( which is great ) and since the mints are white as all of Altoids falvors are;  they do NOT stain your mouth like other black liquorice candy.  Everyone in my family loves these.  I bought a whole case.  Horray for this item.  5 stars.  Nutritional label is as follows :  Calories  ( for 3 pcs ) is 10, total fat zero, sodium zero, total carbs 2 grams, sugars 2 grams.  Ingredients are: Sugar, natural flavors, gum arabic, gelatin.  I highly recommend these to anyone whom loves liquorice without the black stain.

review/text: The past 5 years or more, my wife and I have purchased and enjoyed Altoids...liquorice flavor.  For the past few months, we could no longer find the liquorice flavored Altoids anywhere; and believe me, we looked.  There were new flavors added, but no liquorice flavored Altoids could be found.  Finally, we decided to look on the Altoids website to see if they were still manufacturing this flavor.  To our surprise and our delight, we are still able to enjoy your product because we were able to make our purchase through Amazon. We decided to stock up....couldn't pass up the good deal!

review/summary: Liquorice Altoids
review/text: I was hesitant to order this product, not knowing how strong the mints would be, and with it being a whole case of 12.  But they are very tasty.  I've shared them with at least 15 people, and most of them liked the flavor.  Some found the licorice flavor to be strong, but if you like licorice jellybeans, you will like these.  It is best to let them dissolve slowly, rather than chew them quickly.  The flavor does have a soothing effect on the throat.  The scent is very strong.  People notice that you are using them if they are nearby.  If you leave them in a drawer or cabinet, the scent will surround the space.  But I think they are worth it because they are different, not quite a mint, and leave a good feeling in one's mouth after you have had one.

review/text: Liquorice Altoids are the most versatile "candy" I have ever tasted. They are delicious as as a candy, breath mint, help with nausea and stomach acid. Since I take many medications, I cannot take the usual anti-acids. I have found out that if I take some liquorice altoids my stomach problems go away. The liquorice taste is awesome - and I should know, having grown up in Holland where liquorice is big business. The only wish I have is that I would like to see it in sugar-free, because I am a diabetic.

review/text: If you haven't tried Altoids Liquorice mints, you have no idea what you're missing. Sadly, this flavor is not available in my area, so I've been resorting to buying in bulk when visiting other parts of the country where Altoids sells the liquorice flavor. But I enjoy them so much over other mints that I finally broke down and bought them online. Do yourself a favor and make the same purchase. If you like regular Altoids, you'll love liquorice - curiously awesome.
