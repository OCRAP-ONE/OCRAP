review/summary: Melts in your mouth
review/text: It really does melt in your mouth.  It is so much lighter and more delicate than I expected, even given all the other reviews and descriptions.  I ordered a small quantity (6 ounce jar) to see if I liked it.  I will be ordering a pound well in advance of finishing the jar!  Give this salt a try.  You won't be disappointed.

review/summary: Best tasting soymilk around, and very convenient to bring to work
review/text: Silk Very Vanilla Soy Milk is yummy and consistently good, with each case I purchase. Buying the 8 oz containers of shelf stable soy milk by the case means that it costs a lot less than buying it at my local health food store. My only objection to this product is that the straws are really narrow. So a big hint to all the Very Vanilla Soy Milk fans out there - buy a box of wide straws and use those to drink from the container. Somehow it tastes even yummier like that.<br />Also, it this product can be used to make Chocolate Egg Creams.  In a tall glass put about 1/2 inch of chocolate syrup and about a third of an inch of Very vanilla on top of that.  Stir together with a long, large straw until well blended.  Slowly pour in a seltzer from a freshly opened bottle of seltzer. Yum.

review/summary: Convenient for work lunches
review/text: Silk may not be the healthiest soymilk, but it does taste really good.  These little 8 oz. tetrapacks are super convenient, with the little collapsible straw taped on the side of the box.  Great for work lunches or school snacks.  Too bad this is not available at Costco, they only have chocolate. I can only buy this in the winter months due to summer heat spoiling the product during shipping.

review/text: I think I'm addicted to soy milk lol, so when I saw the price of a Silk pack of 18 I couldn't resist. I buy Silk in the carton or the little bottles you get in the store, but never knew it came in convenient travel sized container packs of 18,24 etc. until now. It was EXACTLY what I wanted. It tastes great, and with free shipping it was still delivered sooner than I expected. I'm completely happy with my purchase and will be getting it again. I'm going to try the chocolate next time too.

review/text: I have a 5yr old that can't drink cows milk, but can have cows milk like cheese and cows milk cooked.  The doc said that she still allergic to cows milk. She us now in kindergarten and at her school they don't offer soy milk the parents have to provide the milk. I have looked all over and this was the best buy for me. She needs 3 sent with her every day. I first was buying at the store and it was getting to be so much to pay. With the free shipping we get it ar our house in about a week. She gets really excited when the boxes are at our front door. The best part of this product is that it doesn't have to be refrigerated until it has been open and it can just sit on our selves until she needs to use it.

review/summary: Almost perfect...
review/text: My son has a severe dairy intolerance, so I have to have these on hand all the time.  The size is good, and the amount per box is plenty.  I just wish they would make the boxes in a regular juice box shape so I can put them in a juice box holder.  They get squeezed way too often.  I usually have to take a sippy cup with me to transfer the drink into before I hand it over.  This isn't that big a deal, but kind of annoying when you're a mom looking for ease and convenience while out and about.  It is also very nice that they don't have to be refrigerated - very convenient when going out.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm very happy with this product.

review/text: I am lactose and tolerant and this is the onLy milk I can tolerate. At first the taste was a little different ,but once I started drinking it more often it worked out. This milk is a little bit on the sweet side so if I eat cereal with it i try to make sure the cereal doesn't have to much sugar or else I will have a sugar attack. Very yummy milk and the price is not bad compared to other lactose milk that taste oh so nastyyyyyyyy!

review/summary: Not Organic...
review/text: I place a couple spoons of organic coffee plus organic soy milk, bring it to boil and then enjoy my coffee. My place is full of coffee aroma using soymilk and can even smell the coffee after I return to my place few hours later. Soyilk is very time consuming to make, so not my gig. SILK soy milk was the first SM that I tried few years ago and it was the worst soy milk I ever tried. Watery, awful tasting. Furthermore SILK did not sell organic soy milk. I even tried to contact SILK to find out if their soy was a GM , they would not respond. Sweeteners are added to all Plain soy milk to change the bitter taste of soy but vanilla does not since vanilla is a sweetener itself so calories are the same but vanilla tastes better. I even tried my coffee with almond milk, whole organic milk, etc. and none comes close to the taste of soy milk.

review/summary: Crown Royal Cask 16 is a more evolved Canadian Whiskey.
review/text: Spiced plum pudding in a glass: Crown Royal Cask No. 16 takes the normally sweet and simple genre of Canadian whiskey somewhere new and more sophisticated.<br /><br />Cask No. 16 is a stunningly beautiful dark bronze hazelnut color.  I've never seen a darker more lovely dram.  The aroma is sweet and rich with figs and prunes (sweet dried black fruits).  There is a subtle floral and woody aroma too - with extended time in the glass.  Entry is sweet and light, but expands beautifully on the tongue with figs, both fresh and dried, more floral perfume, nutmeg and allspice and toasted pecans.  Finish is long and adds complexity with the wood showing up to add tannins' dryness to counter all the fig honey.  Just lovely and yummy.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Canadian whiskey in general.  I find it too sweet and too simple and the spirit flavor inadequately integrated with the grain sweetness (unlike sweet examples from Scotland, Ireland, and the USA which put the spirit better in the mix in my opinion).  Crown Royal Cask No. 16 is an exception.  It's sweet, sure, and there's spirit heat, indeed; but Cask No. 16 brings a wooded sophistication and mixes the figgy fruits with floral perfume and oaky vanilla in a way that is inescapably seductive.  I didn't think I'd love this one - but I do.  I LOVE it.  Bravo, Crown Royal.  They have elevated Canadian whiskey and produced something that can stand with the great spirits of the world.

review/summary: Summer in a Bottle
review/text: Schweppes Bitter Lemon is our family's favorite soft drink.  We drank it regularly when living in the UK.  Having transferred back to the USA, it is much more difficult to locate.  When we found this product via Parthenon Foods on Amazon Marketplace, we jumped at the chance to have it, just in time for a family celebration.  It arrived very nicely packed and was a very large bottle!  YES!!!!<br /><br />The only difference we could see between the UK version and this Greek/German version was the color.  The UK version is a sort of green, while this was a beautiful yellow.  It looked like bottled sunshine.  We're not sure if it was the different color or the actual recipe, but it seemed an even better lemon flavor - the best thing about Bitter Lemon is the fact that it is NOT sicky-sweet.  We love it for the light, refreshing lemon flavor with that touch of quinine (think Tonic Water).  It was difficult, but we made the bottle last for a whole two days. We will definitely come back for this again.

Unfortunately, even with sugar as ingredient #1 and high fructose corn syrup as ingredient #2, Nestle thought it essential to add sucralose (a sugar substitute, Splenda equivalent) as a final ingredient. That makes for a nasty, saccharin-y, hypersweet and artificial aftertaste.  Nasty.  Guess I will have to go back to Costco for Milk Chocolate Swiss Miss.  Adios, Nestle.

review/summary: Packaged goods--not so good.
review/text: I LOVE Nestle Rich Hot Cocoa and I was so excited to find it on Amazon for a reasonable price, but I was really disappointed with the condition of the cans once I got the box they came in opened. Two of the six cans I ordered were crushed on top and one can had a massive gash in it which caused some product to spill out during shipping. This was really disappointing as chocolate isn't cheap. I was also incredibly nervous about using the product not knowing if the gash was man-made or if it was the result of improper handling from the warehouse? Consumers cannot be too careful these days with past cases of product tampering. Overall, I was satisfied with the length of time it took for me to receive the product. I just wish the presentation would have been better. Canned foods should NEVER have holes or gashes in them and crushed cans are usually caused from poor packaging.

review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

review/text: I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn"t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!

It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/text: This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/text: I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

review/text: My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.

This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.

review/summary: Still Not Twice as Good
review/text: I've bought this product from Amazon for almost two years for $20.19 shipped by Amazon as an Amazon Prime product.  Amazon no longer carries it directly and the reseller is charging $44 for the same package plus shipping(down this week from $49 last week).  The cocoa is not twice as good at these prices and I wish Amazon would find a reseller whose price is somewhat closer to the old amazon price. This is a very disappointing message from Amazon to its loyal customers.  W. Grace

review/summary: If you like hot chocolate you will LOVE this!
review/text: I have tried hundreds of hot chocolates from the really expensive and really cheap and this is by far the best you can ever have. It is creamy and the wonderful taste of Butterfingers. It is like a candy bar in a mug. However it is not overpowering.<br /><br />If you want to try something delicious this is perfect.

review/summary: Way over priced.
review/text: This vendor is clearly attempting to take advantage of consumers.  A 4 pack used to be sold for about $20 and has since doubled in price.  If you look elsewhere on the Interned, you can find a MUCH better price.  I just placed an order for the same product with iHerb.com.  A DOZEN 7.33 oz cans only cost me $68,97 and is being shipped 1-3 day for free.

review/summary: Sipped By a Blazing Fire..
review/text: Nestle Hot Cocoa Mix has always been a part of my family as a child and into adulthood. This stuff is chocolaty and tastes great when sipped on a cool Winter night with family and friends, next to a blazing fireplace while reminiscing about the years gone by. If only those years could be relived.. there would be time to enjoy more of this memorable drink.<br /><br />Please rate this review if you found it helpful.

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

review/summary: Nestle's Hot Chocolate Disappeared!
review/text: I had been purchasing these large cans of Nestle's Hot Chocolate all through last winter and even the summer months at my local grocery store. In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week. Very satisfied with the item and the service I received.

review/text: I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate.  We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!
