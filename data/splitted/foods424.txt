review/summary: Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!
review/text: At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.

review/summary: Food for my picky puppy
review/text: I am feeding her this currently while mixing it with the Innova (which is very expensive and hard to find) that her breeder is feeding her. I love that the price is slightly less than other premium, holistic foods and I can get it shipped to me on Prime 2 day shipping.  It's also for all life stages, so I like that if this continues to work for her, I won't need to switch to a different food as she gets older.<br /><br />The ingredients in the food are great, and I especially like that there are pro-biotics.  Because the nutrients are so concentrated, I know that one of these 35 pound bags is going to last me a very long time with one growing puppy. At the same time, I had a difficult time getting her to eat the food (I guess it just didn't smell appealing to her).  I have had to mix it with a little pureed pumpkin and a tablespoon of the Canidae canned food of the same variety to make it a bit more appealing. At the same time, this could just have to do with my picky Lhasa-Shih's taste buds and not the food.  I know that several people who use the premium food are thrilled at the small amount of stool.  Personally, my puppy has still had larger stools at least twice a day (some of this could be from the Innova which she is being weaned off of).  Lhasa's are known for having sensitivities to allergens, and I love that this food is so gentle on her stomach.<br /><br />Mostly, I love that this is carried by Amazon and it can get to my house so quickly and easily. It is hard enough for me to pick up a 35 pound bag of dog food while I'm putting it in a plastic bin (let alone carrying home from the store as I live in a metropolitan area where I take public transit).  Great service and good product.

We were using Diamond Naturals, but I suspect they must have changed the formula because suddenly his allergies flared up and he ended up with an ear infection. We switched to this dog food and he LOVES it. Not only does he love it, but his ear infection is now gone and he's itching/scratching/chewing MUCH less.. We're grateful to have found it and hope they do not change the formula!

review/summary: Dog developed GI problems
review/text: Our 6-year old Vizsla has been eating Canidae for 3 years. A month ago we switched flavors from Bison to Sea Salmon.  We gradually transitioned the change even though it was the same company.  Within four weeks on the new flavor he developed a set of distressing systems including soft, mucus covered stools, horrible gas,low energy, staggering walk, excessive drooling, licking and constant neck extending (difficulty swallowing).  A vet visit confirmed these as diet related.  We put him on a chicken/rice diet and his symptoms stopped after just two days.  Doing research to decide whether to switch back to bison or go with another company, I found a great deal of  information about other pet owners having issues with all flavors of food from Canidae. Consumer Affairs reports a pending class action suit.  We have decided to switch to another company.

review/summary: three empty dishes can't be wrong
review/text: My two Rhodesian Ridgebacks and one Labrador Retriever are no pushovers.<br /><br />Even other varieties of highly regarded Canidae food have left them looking up at me over lightly rearranged bowls of food with that 'Why have you turned against us again?' look.<br /><br />But whenever I bring home the thirty-pound bags of Canidae Chicken Meal and Rice, the dogsters nose hungrily around the car before I can even get the stuff out of the trunk. I've long since settled on Canidae (for its reputation as nutritious and high-quality) and on the Chicken Meal and Rice (for the predictability factor with my threesome).<br /><br />Things just got better, however, when I realized that my Amazon Prime membership allows me to order a thirty-bound bag for second-day delivery at no cost (in fact, it usually arrives the next day) at a price lower than what I was paying locally.<br /><br />This has allowed me to move to a just-in-time delivery service, which cuts down on the storage needs and may be attractive for other owners of multiple and/or large dogs.

review/summary: Dog loves it; no tummy problems, but I've eased the transition
review/text: I've been feeding my dog (75 pound Golden mix, about 5 years old) Canidae for 3-4 days now, and she absolutely loves it! She's always been a picky eater, often ignoring food in her bowl, but she laps this up as soon as I put it in.  I've been mixing it with her old food to ease her into the transition.  For the first two days I did 75% old food, 25% Canidae.  Today I've done half and half.  No tummy problems.  If anything she seems to have more energy.  The only thing is that now I have to really police how much food I give her, whereas with her old food I knew she would only eat it if she were hungry. But I'm happy she's happy! I'm also happy to have found a food that seems to be much better quality, and for a price that's within my tight budget.

review/summary: Great Quality Dog Food
review/text: My Boxer have tried various dog foods. He started with Nutro as a puppy but after a year, he started not liking his food so we switched to Science Diet. After much research, found that Science Diet did not use the quality products... so we switched to Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Adult Dog food. My dog loved the food but realized he had allergies to one of the ingredients. So we changed to Canidae and he loves this and has no allergies.<br /><br />When My husband and I researched good quality dog food, we found a lot of great quality dog food and most of them were pretty pricy but we found Canidae and Chicken Soup to be the best quality for a good price. I would recommend Canidae Lamb Meal and Brown Rice to any dog owners. My dog has been on it for about 6 months now and its been great!

review/summary: Excellent for large breed dogs
review/text: Our Rhodesian Ridgebacks were on this food some years back and we moved, thus losing access to it at the new location. I am very glad to see Amazon carrying Canidae and that it's available using the Prime Membership! We have fed many, many dogs the Canidae when we we were fostering rescue dogs (an average of 3 new dogs a month for years) and it was the only food NONE of them ever had any trouble eating & digesting. Our own pack has a couple of members with soy allergies, so I'm careful about what we feed. They have been back on the Canidae for a few months now with no drama at all. The switch from their old food back to the Canidae was easy and stress free and all 6 dogs scarf it down like it was prime rib. (or you know...a squirrel) Even my father's Chihuahua likes it and that little diva used to think she could only eat human food! I have been able to cut back by a half cup on the daily ration for our largest dog as he was putting extra weight on with his previous amount from the old food. Everyone's coat is soft and shiny, they all have loads of energy and are generally in excellent overall health - that doesn't happen with the grocery store bargain foods. Again, I am VERY VERY glad to see the big bags of Canidae available from Amazon!!

review/text: About 4 years ago we were told that our dog Grace had Chronic Kidney Failure, and that we should switch her diet from a dry diet to a wet diet...I researched wet processed canned dog foods and most of them had potato as an ingredient. Our dog reacts to eating potato, sweet potato, yes she can eat, but not regular potato! So I then figured that I had to cook her food for her! Living in Alaska, fresh is not always available year round, so I found this product, Canine Caviar dehydrated vegetable mix, and it has been a part of her diet now going on the fifth year now...I have a vet friend and she helped me come up with a mixture of this super product, ground turkey, eggs, and salmon, millet, barley, and quinioa... A dog stew ! People would never even guess that Grace is 16 now, and going strong... Thank you Amazon for carrying this product... By the way I have heard that this product can be used to make great human soups too!!!

review/summary: YEARS OLD AND DISGUSTING, TEXTURE OF HARD CANDY
review/text: If I wanted to eat rock hard, expired candy I would just go across the street to the gas station. These are the OLDEST, grossest sour punch straws I've ever tasted. They are as hard as a jawbreaker and they taste rotten and plastic-y. Do not order from amazon! I just basically threw $22 in the garbage.

review/text: The strawberry is undoubtedly the best flavor of sour punch straws. Sadly, they don't seem to sell them anywhere in my new town, so I decided to buy in bulk and have them shipped.  Shipping was awesome, received it within 2 days.<br /><br />If you are a sour punch straw junkie like me, you can't go wrong ordering this product.

review/text: This is the only flavor of this product that our dog will eat (11 year old Female Tea-cup Poodle) and trust me we have tried the others to no avail.  We have also tried seperating the beef from the beef and cheese and she will not eat that either.  The Beef and Chicken are more than her snacks (it is her primary food) when she is being finicky or when the Grandchildren are around.<br /><br />We received exactly what we needed and are very pleased with dealing with the seller....excellent experience!!<br />Thank you!!

review/text: The other reviewer must have been in a bad mood or feeling a bit above it all. This is a fine meal and keeps you from going hungry. Very convenient; you just nuke for 2 minutes right in its own container and then you tear the film top off and can eat it right out of the container with a spoon. It keeps for a couple of years at room temperature and is fresh as a daisy when you open it. Yes, it contains a lot of salt. Big deal. Recently they have found that eating a lot of salt is not in the least a detriment to persons in normal health.<br /><br />Like all of the Hormels Compleats it has a fine flavor and texture, contains nothing that is tough to chew, and is well suited to persons living alone who have poor/few teeth.

review/summary: Not recommended
review/text: This could be better labeled chicken and dumpling soup.  It does not look like the picture on the label.  The one that I tried had an excessive amount of liquid.  You need a spoon to eat it.  The flavor was OK, but the nutritional value is questionable.  It has a reasonable amount of protein but, like similar products, has a large amount of salt, 990 mg., not much fiber, and not much in the way of vitamins.  It has potato starch added, which is not good as a dietary item if you are watching your weight.<br /><br />On prepartion, it is easy to microwave but the liquid boiled through the slits in the plastic film.  It is necessary to place in on a microwave safe plate - otherwise you will have a mess in the bottom of the microwave.  The plastic film is a little hard to peel loose after cooking.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend it.  There are better products available.

review/summary: Tasty and free of nasty fake sugars
review/text: This gum is old school.  It doesn't believe in all those fancy, new fangled sugar alternatives.  Ingredients are simple: cane sugar, glucose, gum base, rice syrup, beeswax, carnuba wax and flavors.  It also doesn't mess around with synthetic color agents (no Red #40 or Yellow #5 lurking in these boxes).  Bonus is that it tastes great.  No it doesn't stay flavorful for an extra, extra, extra long time, but its delicious for long enough to get a nice minty taste in my mouth and satisfy my desire to chew.<br /><br />I had discovered Glee Gum years ago and enjoyed it, but hadn't thought much about it again until I became pregnant last year and realized EVER gum at the corner store or gas station had either aspartame or saccharine in it.  Even the tried and true Juicy Fruit has turned to the dark side.  Thank you Glee Gum for offering this delicious, all natural alternative to the neuro-toxin laced sticks sold by your competitors.  I appreciate it and I will continue to buy your fine product for many years to come.

review/summary: Works for us!
review/text: This is the only kind of gum my kids have ever had, and they like it. Their favorite flavors are cinnamon, tangerine and "very berry".  The squares are tiny, so I always let them have two at a time. The flavor doesn't last long, but that's OK, because I prefer that they not chew it very long anyway. So far, they don't have any fillings that might cause sticking, and it doesn't seem to stick to their sealants. We're glad to have an all-natural option when it comes to gum!

review/summary: Good alternative to what's out there.
review/text: This is a good alternative to the vast majority of gum in the marketplace if you wish to stay away from artificial sweeteners. Adults will probably want to chew two pieces at a time. With 18 pieces per box, this is fine. The gum does lose its flavor more quickly than other gum (I'd say it loses most of the flavor in about 10-15 minutes, all of the flavor about 5-10 minutes after that). I'm OK with this, as I'd rather just add another piece than have to use a gum with an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Overall, very good choice for someone looking for an alternative to artificial sweeteners in a market dominated by them.

review/summary: Wish Glee Gum had a little more "glee"
review/text: I'm now on a restrictive diet and only allowed specific "natural" sugars; I have been on the search for gum and mints which do not contain fake sugars (sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, xylitol, etc.) I was so pleased to find "glee". The pieces are reminiscent of Chiclets brand. Glee pieces are not as soft as brands with fake sugars (dentyne, eclipse, etc.) The gum can stick to dental work, but as another reviewer mentioned, chewing more than one piece usually resolves that issue. My biggest complaint is that the flavor does not last....at all - in comparison to other gum. I was pleased to find that Altoids mints are made from real sugar and if I chew an Altoid at the same time, it extends the mint flavor slightly AND prevents the sticking to dental work. Altoids used to market a gum, but it is no longer available. Glee is ok for now, but I'll still be on the lookout for a real sugar gum with longer lasting flavor.

review/summary: Great alternative to chewing gums that contain artificial sugars and ingredients
review/text: The peppermint Glee gum is a great alternative to mainstream, artificially-flavored chewing gum. The taste is pleasant, with a great balance of peppermint and sweetness. While most other gums use plastic and foil packaging, Glee gum uses a simple and natural cardboard packaging.<br /><br />However, working with fewer artificial ingredients does have a few drawbacks. First, as other reviewers have commented, the flavor does fade quickly. Second, the gum tends to be a bit sticker, which may be an issue for those with sensitive teeth.<br /><br />Overall, Glee gum is a great product and is the only gum I chew. Highly recommended for those who are looking for an alternative to artificially sweetened gum.

I like how it stays firm when chewing for hours and still stays not hard but not soft where as other gums become really soft (making it stick to teeth and braces) or really hard (making it hard to chew over time). The only downside is that the flavor only lasts a couple of munites but other than that I love it.<br /><br />P.S - The Amazon price is great and with free 2 day shipping with Amazon Prime I got it in one day.

review/summary: does NOT stick to fillings or crowns/great flavor
review/text: I have enjoyed chewing gum for decades but a recent anti-inflammatory diet kick meant I either had to ditch 'chemically laden' gum or find an alternative. Glee has more sugar than I'd like but none of the dangerous chemicals I ingested when chewing my old standby brands. Flavor is great although it doesn't last but I didn't expect chemical enhancement. It does NOT stick to fillings or crowns (gold or porcelain). If it weren't for the high levels of sugar, I'd consider ordering again.<br /><br />WARNING (2/2011) - after several orders from amazon.com I am now refused delivery of additional units...so keep this in mind. Amazon.com does not apparently want to provide continuous service as a source of this product.

review/text: The best thing about this gum is the packaging.<br /><br />Where to begin on what is wrong with this gum? About 30 seconds after the start of chewing, the flavor is gone. The gum devolves to chewing flavorless cud. Each piece of gum quickly reduces to nothingness while chewing. I had to chew about three to four pieces just to have an approximate equivalent to a "normal" piece of gum. If there's any benefit to the all-natural ingredients, I don't know what they are. It's not like the gum is being digested and absorbed.<br /><br />I won't make the mistake of buying Glee gum again.

Your money is better spent sucking on lollipops or eating (what I have found) the only gum that doesn't have artificial sweeteners, dentine gum, cinnamon.. this is never-ending disappointment.. or never-ending calories as you try to keep up with the flavor.

We initially ordered these to replace 'large flakes' from another processor.  The others were more of a 'shaved' form, while these are more like long shreds.  They are delicious crunched up on their own, or on top of a special treat =)  I've enjoyed making my own low-ingredient 'truffles' by mixing a bunch of flakes with unsweetened cacao and water and mixing it with our stick-mixer.

review/text: When they arrived the dogs were smelling the box as they knew what was in there.  When they hear the bag opening they come running and take theirs into the other room.  It is like a stick lollypop for dogs as it keeps them quiet and calm and a great reward.

review/summary: Carbonated apple beverage from Mexico!
review/text: Recently I made yet another stop at JIM'S APPLE FARM (just south of Jordan, MN), and this time I found this wonderful apple flavored soda made in Mexico.  In essence, it tastes like a very light apple juice that has been sweetened with cane sugar and carbonated.  Simply put, it's a good product!  According to information that I've read, this product was first introduced to U.S. markets in the late 1980's.  However, at least in this part of the country, it hasn't made much of an impact.  Now that I've been introduced to this beverage, I'll be keeping an eye out for it.  I highly recommend giving it a try.

review/summary: Simply the best...
review/text: My wife and I are thorough "feta foodies".  We've tried just about every feta available to US consumers and this is the absolute best we have found so far -- smoother, creamier, and seasoned the best.  Far better than Bristol Farms, Trader Joe's, or any other grocery store selection.  This is the stuff whether you use it on salads, in scrambled eggs, or just as a table cheese.  I think the difference may be that this feta doesn't seem to be brined which can oddly dry out, mush up, and give the cheese a completely different texture than this brand.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Amazon charges twice as much as a  Walmart store
review/text: I discoved this drink two weeks ago at a truck stop on my return home from Virginia. A cool can from their refrigerated diaplay cost $2.49. I liked the flavor and kick from the Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Coffee drink and the Starbucks Doubleshot Energy Plus Mocha, also $2.49 a can. I couldn't find either type in the local grocery store, so I automatically began my Amazon.com order then, right before I checked out, read the customer reviews from the other Amazon sites about the high price Amazon was charging $79.95 plus shipping charges for a 12 pack of the Starbucks Doubleshop Energy Plus drink. I checked with my local Walmart grocery store, and bought both kinds for $2.50 a 15 oz can which comes to only $30.00 for 12 cans (no shipping charges).  I am very disappointed that Amazon.com is charging in excess for this product and will definitely do some comparative price shopping in the future before I automatically shop at Amazon.com.

review/summary: Spicy and sweet!
review/text: Theo's milk chocolate coconut curry bar is not for everyone -- it is very spicy and the sting of curry powder is the highest note in the taste, at least initially.  But this is my favorite of Theo bars, not just for the spiciness, but also because the spice quickly dissipates as the chocolate melts on the tongue, and the sting is soothed by one of the best milk chocolates I've ever tasted -- silky as it dissolves.  The coconut adds a bit of crunch to the texture.  This is a highly unique bar, and very rewarding if you like sophisticated taste combinations.

But no ...<br /><br />Two great tastes do not always taste great together.  I thought I was really going to like this, but I thought it was terrible.  There is almost no blend of the curry/chocolate flavors.  It tastes like putting a big spoonful of dry curry powder in your mouth, and then taking a bit of a chocolate bar.  I couldn't taste the coconut at all.<br /><br />I have had some of the other Theo Chocolate bars, like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VUETIA">Bread & Dark Chocolate</a>, and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VUGQG8">Fig, Fennel & Almond</a>, and they were great.

review/summary: If you like curry...
review/text: I agree that the curry is very dominating in this chocolate bar but then again, I love curry. I first came upon this bar at Whole Foods. They had a little sample table set up and I normally don't buy chocolate so I just walked by but I overheard the woman at the table say coconut curry and I ran over to see what they were talking about. I tasted the bar and my eyes rolled into my head. For me, this is the best mixture of tastes. I even told the woman at the table that this is by far the best chocolate bar I've ever had. The coconut is not a prominent flavor it is so mild that I don't taste it much if at all. The grittiness that someone mentioned, I believe, is the coconut so it adds more texture than taste in my opinion. This is not a mild bar with just a hint of flavor so if you are not a curry fan, this most likely isn't for you.

I hate the texture, I hate the taste, I hate how it gets oily after a few days.  I'm always trying new brands in the hopes of finding one I like - and I finally have a winner!  Planters crunchy peanut butter is remarkable in that it doesn't taste like peanut butter...it tastes like peanuts.  Most crunchy brands I've tried still have the same texture and taste issues for me as creamy PB - but I was amazed by Planters. It tasted like eating a large spoonful of yummy roasted peanuts.  I actually find myself craving it sometimes.  Well done, Planters.

Normally, he eats very little, but give him these crackers, fruit, and cheese and he is a happy boy.  He will eat other brands, but this one is by far his favorite.  It is true that the crackers fall apart easily and don't have much taste for an adult, but if you have allergic children, give them a try.  Somehow, they have great appeal.

This cracker is not made from brown rice flour; instead, it was made whole kernels. I suppose that I should have been able to figure out the texture from the ingredient list: brown rice, salt. Yes, there is no baking soda, oil, or sugar to give the cracker any flavor.

review/text: I love these crackers! So many gluten-free crackers, I haven't been able to stomach the taste of. These remind me of a gluten-free "Triscuit." They're crunchy, ridged, and nutty-tasting. I love topping them with cheese, or little bits of lunchmeat and mayo, or any other topping.<br /><br />I don't understand how people could rate them a "0," except by understanding that everyone has different taste.

review/text: Rice Sticks by Mondo Food<br /><br />I use these in my homemade chicken noodle soup, stir fries, etc.  They are tasty and wonderful, and this bag is easier to separate the noodles if needed than some are.  I currently have three or so bags stored in my pantry.  I keep them on hand, as I cannot have gluten, dairy or soy, and these are an allergen free kitchen basic.  I just open the bag over a large container and slide the noodles into it, then run very hot tap water to cover them and let set for about ten minutes.  Then I take my kitchen shears and cut them into smaller lengths.  When ready to add or use them, I drain off as much of the water as I can without losing the noodles, then lift them by hand into the soup or into a serving bowl.  When I get near the end, I drain off the rest of the water and then pour them into the soup or lift them into the bowl.  If I have leftovers, I store them, covered, in the refrig.  (Use within three or so days.)<br /><br />GREAT!

This honey met my best expectations, it has very nice texture and aroma to it. For this price, I couldn't believe it, it does taste like a gourmet honey. I disagree with one of the previous comments. This honey's taste is NOT overbearing at all. Good quality honey should have a distinct flavor (that's what sets apart honeys coming from different areas and flower types) and that easily recognizable flavor is what is valued in each type of honey.

review/text: For several years, I've been purchasing local honey from my local Natural Food Coop. Unfortunately, as the years have passed, not only has the price gone up but they have moved away from the unusual and toward more generic "let's please everyone" products. The local honey, star thistle, that I preferred, has a wonderful strong, earthy flavor to it and I've been missing it. Orange blossom honey is just, well, just sweet.<br /><br />This honey--Honey Tree's Organic Rainforest Honey has that nice strong, earthy, flavor that I have been missing. To me, honey is not just a sweetener but a flavor to add wherever I want. If I want just a sweetener, Splenda is just fine.<br /><br />Truthfully, I purchased this honey because of the price. I wish that it were available as a Subscribe & Save, but, regardless, I will be purchasing it on a regular basis.

I was a bit skeptical about ordering honey online after reading reviews from other users regarding the poor packing and how their honey spilled over. Guess what - now they have an extra seal under the cap of each and every bottle! So even if the cap is broken the honey wont spill. The honey tastes good. Goes perfectly well as a sweetener for my green tea. Also I thought it would be worth mentioning that the bottles do not have any expiry date (best before date) specified on them - this is unlike the highly processed honey you get in the super stores.

review/summary: Odd taste
review/text: I had high hopes for this organic honey and even started a subscription, but I found the taste just slightly odd and off putting.  I can't quite put my finger on it, and maybe I got a bad batch, but it's not good. I've cancelled my subscription and am continuing to look for a good organic honey.

review/summary: Can't get any better.
review/text: This is the best honey I have ever bought. (.) Although this is also the least viscous one too. I never knew we could pour it so easily.<br />I have tried BusyBee's too and that tastes great too, but in my opinion Rainforest is better.

review/summary: nice....but........Honey Tree's Organic Rainforest Honey
review/text: I bought this product through Amazon...<br /><br />it is a nice tasting honey....but....when I got the information about this honey that...it was not only for consuming but for the face treatment, in the daily mail, uk, due to be affected by the wheather factors in the very south of Chile where it was suppossed to originate....I was disappointed that is bottled and labelled to be produced here in the US...and says nothing of being originated in Chile...which in the daily mail uk was one of its publicity strenght...<br />either the publicity is misleading or the label is incomplete...
