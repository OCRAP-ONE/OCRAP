review/text: since i am borderline diabetic, i try NOT to use sugar products at all.  many web sites recommend using brown rice syrup for recipes for diabetics, though, so i've decided to give it a chance.<br /><br />with the purchase of this product, i feel empowered to start baking things that i would like to eat but have not been able to eat because of their high sugar content.<br /><br />blessings to all at NOW for being the wonderful company that it is.

review/text: This is very fresh and good quality sumac. I use it whenever we make persian rice with kabobs. It has a wonderful tang to it and the price is very good. It's hard to run to the international food store just for some herbs so I love purchasing them from amazon because of the convenience factor.

review/summary: Substandard quality
review/text: I was looking to try some premium nuts that gave me more than what I could obtain at a regular Grocery store.  The packaging is beautiful and you are sure you are in for a treat.  However at least a quarter of the nuts were not open and so tough to try to open that it was easier to just throw them away.  The size ranged from extra large (maybe 15%) to small (most of these unopened).  In conclusion this product was far worse than even the most commmon grocery brands.  The person in charge of quality control was probably at the dentist getting their chipped tooth fixed after trying to open some of these nuts.

review/summary: Bad buy of nuts from Setton
review/text: I have been buying Pistachios all my life and was pleased to order from a Calif. Farm.<br />We are totally disappointed in the product.  Beautiful bag but the nuts are terrible.  Many not opened, lots of shiveled meat to the extent that no one ate them.  The meat we did get is probably last  years crop because it was such poor quality.  Really got burned on this one and Amazon should do a check up on these people because we trust you and normally all is O.K.

review/summary: In My Opinion The Gold Standard of US Pistachios.
review/text: I hesitated to pay 'so much' for a pound of pistachios but after peering into the canvas bag to look at the nuts packaged within I couldn't help but purchase them (and anyway, I only discovered later that the bag is actually 21 Oz. making these inexpensive).<br />For, these nuts really are extra-large and virtually all of them are open wide enough so that the two halves can be pulled apart with minimal effort (thus perfect for snacking on even whilst driving; although, this is definitely not a recommended usage).<br />I now know that the reason they are so easy to open is that these nuts were tree-ripened such that the hulls opened naturally just as God intended for them to do.  Many, if not most, other unshelled Pistachios have been machined-opened which makes it more likely that the shell will be partially opened and tough to crack.<br /><br />I prefer just about everything with a little more salt so I wouldn't have complained if these had been more salty; still, these are plenty good as they are.<br /><br />What I like most about this product is that the nut meat is actually sweet and flavorful.  In other words, if you would like to know what a premium California Pistachio nut tastes like, you should certainly buy a bag of these.<br /><br />The very best Pistachios I have ever had was in, of all places, Iran, and I think these the best Pistachios I've ever had since then.

review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I absolutely love these. I have a 15 lb mini aussie who is notorious for devouring things that should take him days or weeks to chew through in a matter of a couple hours. I decided to try these after trying a different dental bone that lasted 2 days. These looked harder, so I had high hopes.<br />It took about 5 minutes to get him started chewing on the bone, I'm not sure if it didn't smell like food or if he was just unsure about the density, but after that he was hooked. He chews on it quite often, but it's lasted 2 weeks and he's still got about 1/3 of the first one left.<br />The best part about these are that they REALLY freshened his breath. He's always had a breath problem, it just stinks! But these bones have made it perfectly tolerable. They've also cleaned his teeth, although not as much as I'd hoped (hence the 4 star rating instead of 5) however, I do not expect a bone to take up all the slack in hygiene, so I am quite content letting it freshen his breath and still getting his teeth cleaned regularly.

review/text: I ordered the product and had my parents send it to me in Denmark. It cost a lot in shipping fees and upon arrival, I was left disappointed.<br /><br />The product wasn't Trolli brand gummy worms, but rather some gift shop type knock-off. Furthermore, Trolli's sold in-store do not contain gluten (I have celiac disease) but these did. It made it obsolete.<br /><br />In their defense, it could be old Tolli brand worms (as they used to) but then they would be old. These looked new but didn't have the same taste and consistency as normal Trolli worms.

review/summary: Fruity Tea
review/text: I have been drinking tea for about 50 years or so, and Stash makes a great-tasting full-bodied tea.  This tea has a smooth fruity taste (peach).  It is not overbearing, but a nice subtle peachiness.<br /><br />Individually sealed in a paper/foil pouch for added freshness, this tea is listed as having 100 % natural ingredients.  They are, in the order listed, wuyi oolong tea<br />orange peel, lemongrass, and white peach flavor.<br /><br />It has been said that oolong tea was named after the part of Wuyi mountain, in China, where it was originally produced. It is among the most popular types of teas served in typical Chinese restaurants. (I have also found Jasmine tea and varieties of green tea in typical Chinese restaurants&iexcl;Xand plum wine.  Yum.)<br /><br />It is also suggested that oolong tea is useful for weight loss.  In my (non-medical) opinion (I am not a doctor), like anything else, it can HELP but won&iexcl;�t carry the load.  Oolong appears to be a diuretic, helping you to loose excess water.  If you lose too much water, you might dehydrate or lose valuable potassium.  So, I suggest that you limit yourself to 24 oz a day.  As with anything else, seek guidance from your health care practitioner.<br /><br />I suggest adding agave cactus juice, unbleached natural brown sugar, or honey, if you want a sweetener.  I like fruity teas often in the evening, and instead of dessert.<br /><br />Darn it!  Now I&iexcl;�m craving Chinese food and am snowed in--in a blizzard&iexcl;Xwith over 40 inches of snow on the ground.  I wonder if they will deliver? �

review/summary: Best chocolate tea I've had
review/text: Generally, I don't like flavored tea. And the experiences I've had with chocolate flavored tea left me convinced it really couldn't be done in any palatable way. I was wrong. I don't know what led me to try Stash's Chocolate Mint Oolong but this tea is outstanding! It does NOT taste like Palmer's chocolate coins dissolved and diluted in too much water, which is what most chocolate tea tastes like to me -- not even a Hershey's kiss, but Palmer's -- yuck! This tea has a very light yet distinct chocolaty flavor followed by sweet mint. It's refreshing in the evening after dinner when I want something sweet but don't want to load up on sugar right before bedtime. And, truth be told, it's a delight any time of day.

review/text: This Stash flavor is so deliciously tropical I love it hot or cold.  Made with 100% natural ingredients of :wuyi oolong tea,  orange peel, and flavors of coconut, pineapple, and mango.  It's caffeine free and I like this espeically as a cold drink in the mornings vs coffee in the summer time;  very refreshing and tropical.  Takes 3-5 minutes to steep and if making iced tea Stash recommends using double strength...2 bags per cup.  As with many of the unique Stash brand varieties ; licorice and pure peppermint,  this is difficult sometimes to get at the local stores so I buy either direct from the company or here on Amazon. Delicious. 5 stars to a great brand of Stash.

review/text: Love this tea.  Unlike a lot of (supposedly) flavored teas, this one actually has a strong flavor; more coconut "tropical" than mango but really tasty, with a strong smell too.  I think it tastes best with a touch of sweetener (honey, agave, etc.) to further enhance the flavor.  After finding it once, I haven't been able to find this flavor at any of my local grocery stores, so I ordered the box of 6.  Everyone I have shared this tea with has loved it too!.

They give you something that you can crunch on that has high protein and lower carb content.  They also don't use any scary additives like MSG.  To me, they are almost like a crunchier version of Cheetos.  Okay, they are a bit different, but I love them the same.  My only complaint is that one bag is 1.75 servings.  This is rather strange to me.  Either make the bags one serving, or give the nutrition information for a whole bag.  I'm still giving it 5 stars because the product far outweighs this shortcoming.

Depending on the item, the bags are usually 1.5 to 1.75 ounce when the single serving is 1 ounce.  So that 130 calories is NOT for the entire bag.  If you eat the entire 1.5 ounce bag it just shy of 200 calories.  That's a significant difference for me.  I still enjoy Kay's Naturals but I wish they would bag them differently to make it easier to eat the correct amount.

I've been on the Medifast diet plan for 3+ months now and the plan entails keeping carbs low and protein a bit higher.  Unfortunately, Medifast food is very expensive.<br />I happened across a mention of these in one of the medifast discussion threads  and decided to give them a try.  I WILL NEVER buy medifast parmesan cheese puffs for more than $2 per serving again!! These are so much better - and while they have slightly less fiber - they have fewer carbs as well - and nearly equivalent protein.  Less sodium too.<br />Best of all - they have a light, non greasy texture, suberb crunch and a good cheese flavor.<br />Just ordered 2 more boxes so my kids can have some as well!<br />Woohoo!!! Yay Kay's!!! Keep 'em coming!

review/summary: Great snack with the protein Gastric Bypass patients need!!!!
review/text: After gastric bypass surgery, you have to eat 50 or more grams of protein EVERY DAY.  Sugar-free Protein shakes give you most of it.  But you do like to get it from other sources also.  You have a very small 1/8-1/4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value.  Also, you can't eat sugar., but you can eat sugar substitutes.  So KAY'S NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE GREAT!  They have tons of protein and they taste great!  The kruncheeze are like cheetos and you like to be able to have a snack when other people do.  Also, the cinnamon toast pretzels are great...the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it--because there isn't much of it.  Thank you KAYS!  You help us take casre of ourselves while we ENJOY food and make eating a little more normal.  Lisa

review/summary: A worthwhile alternative for WLS patients.
review/text: hey are a crispy, highly noisy crunch of a snack, that tastes like parmesan cheese and a touch of herbs.  I am trying to think of something on the market that they are most similar to, but I'm at a loss.  They're more like a super crunchy cereal in mouth feel, crossed between a Frito, if that makes any sense.  The fact that I went ahead and ate the entire bag and enjoyed every bite is enough for me.  I liked these a lot more than the golden butter twist pretzels, a lot.<br /><br />As a stand-alone snack, they're just perfect.<br /><br />They also have a cute shape that begs for a little skinny dip action, maybe The Fage Onion Dip or hummus for a protein wollop?  OR, crush them in a plastic bag, and make some lower-carb chicken parmesan, yes, I'd try to use these in place of bread crumbs.  The kids would definitely also eat these, plain (or with fun dips) as the baby showed me when she ran away with my "Mmm, was dats?"

review/text: This is a good alternative to regular chips is you have to watch calories and carbs, however, this wasn't really as good as other brands of soy or low carb.  I bought the 12 pak a while back, and still a bunch in the cupboard.  I guess that I am the not the only one here (Family of 5) that didn't care for them.  I prefer the Robert's Gourmet as did the rest of the family.  Expecially the Ranch.  Really good.  Texture and flavor is much better

review/text: I ordered these based on the positive reviews on amazon as well as I had been satisfied by other products by Kay's naturals. I found the cheddar cheese taste to be ok but the problem was that over 50% of the crackers in the bag have been crunched and it makes it difficult to eat. I canceled my subscription to the crackers. The box arrived intact and well packaged but the inside items were still crushed.

review/summary: Product is barely edible & packages do not include the amount advertised.
review/text: The quantity information on this product is inaccurate. The ad says each bag is 1.5 ounces, (even 1.75 ounces per bag, if you read further on the description), but it has actually been downsized to 1.2 ounces.<br /><br />For the case of 12 that I bought I received a full 3.6 ounces less than was advertised. Customers have a right to know how much product they are getting when they order. Although I have informed them of this error they still have not changed the promotion to read the correct 1.2oz. Buyer beware.<br /><br />Edit: I didn't realize while I was complaining about the downsizing that they also changed the formula. The product is less crunchy, almost stale, and far more crumbly than before. I am removing my subscription to this product.

The little bag contains 1.5 servings.  That is true "word-magic" rip-off.  Such distortion may be legal but it completely skews the information for those of us on low-carb diets.  Shame on Kay's!  I will never buy anything from this company again, and urge you to do the same.

review/summary: Very good and very very hot!
review/text: But thats what you would expect and thats exactly what you want with a real<br />jerk marinade!<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating the heat level of this stuff, its probably more than<br />most can tolerate. But, being a front line chilihead from way back, the heat<br />blends perfectly with the other spices to make either your chicken, fish, or<br />pork come alive.<br /><br />The directions say to use 1 Tsp per pound of meat, but I use considerably more<br />than that, and let marinate for an hour. Actually you will get better results<br />if you go for 24 hours in a ziplock bag in the fridge. You don't need to use<br />salt and pepper, this has all the spice you need, and its all natural. Maybe<br />the best thing about this wondermous stuff is that its available locally almost<br />everywhere for under $4.<br /><br />BTW, the other commercially available jerk seasoning comes from Walkerswood.<br />They are both fantastic, the Walkerswood is a little saltier however so if you<br />have any sensitivity to sodium then this is just the trick for you. But with the<br />Grace seasoning, your finished product will have a green color, if you've used the<br />grill you probably wont notice... the oven is another story.

review/text: When I got them, I was disapointed that the tiny treats were soooo small. I even tried to use other treats in my Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Dog Toy (ball), and Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy. Then I found that the other treats got stuck, and would not come out. When I put the small Buddy Berries in the ball - yes - it was just right! And, more importantly, my poodle absolutely loves them, and works hard to get every last piece out! They are extremely crunchy (which I think helps to keep the ball dry so that moisture doesn't gum up the opening).<br /><br />Great product!!

review/summary: Crushed and dogs don't like them much
review/text: The first think I noticed (besides that the bag is smaller than I'd imagined) was that my bag of treats had a lot of "powder" from crushed treats in it.  I opened the bag and offered the tiny brown lumps to my toy poodles.  One of them reluctantly ate it and the other refused.  I do like that these are tiny since I wanted to use them for training and don't want to overfeed my dogs, but in order for training treats to be effective, the dogs have to LOVE them.  These are not going to motivate my dogs to do anything.  I have the toy that they go with, but I don't think they will even care enough about these treats to work at getting them out of the toy.  I'll be going back to Zukes and cut them in half.

review/text: For some reason, I thought these contain some berries (my dog loves picking blackberries off the bushes in the late summer).  They don't. Just plain old cheap, small training treats.  Cheap, good alternative to something like Zuke's for training (which I cut in half for my dog's training class, since it is a clicker training evening where he stuffs his stomach with tons of treats).  I'm sure they're not as great nutritionally as some other treats, but comes with quite a bit for $4.  My dog likes them, but he's not very picky either.  They're smaller than a centimeter in diameter, and would not be good for a kong because they'd fall out wayyyy too quickly.  I think they're just good training treats, or good for a food puzzle with only a very small hole (akin to the kong wobbler with maybe a tennis ball inside along with the treats).

I was looking for something to entertain her but the treat dispensers were not holding her interest.  Instead, I scatter a small handful on my rug and she really enjoys sniffing them out... she cannot see them because the detail of the oriental rug is so intricate so she has to rely on her nose - it's fun to watch her get excited when she catches a whif of one!

review/summary: Buddy Berries Biscuits
review/text: My dog is a little chihuahua and he is normally a very fussy dog when it comes to food. When I opened the packet and gave him one biscuit to see if he would like it, he gobbled it straight down. I gave him another one and he still enjoyed eating it. I was very happy that my dog enjoyed eating the biscuits, so they were not a waste to buy. Even a fussy dog has his weakness!

review/text: I was surprised when I opened the box & these Buddy Berries didn't look at all like the photo. They actually look & smell like cat food, small bland tan pellets. So far my dogs don't mind eating them but I won't buy again. Would not recommend to anyone.

review/summary: Tasty..but really tiny.
review/text: I bought these to fill the Busy Budy Puppy Waddle Treat Dog Toy.  I have to say my Pomeranian puppy LOVES the taste of them, but they are almost too small for the toy and the fall out without him even having to work for them.  I wish they were a little bigger, but I still use them.  Also, a ton come in the bag, so they should last a while.

review/summary: Too small for their intended use
review/text: These were linked with the Waggle -- there may even be a photo of the toy on the front of the treat bag.<br /><br />I'm still using these, just to get rid of them, but when used with the small Waggle they provide no challenge for my 12-pound mix. They're too small and fall right out with almost no effort on her part, which -- I want her occupied! The pieces are also too small to be used as treats; each is about the size of a small pill or long grain of rice. To keep the pieces from falling out immediately, I usually seal the opening of the Waggle with peanut butter before I give her the toy.<br /><br />The chicken flavoring grosses me out; it reminds me a little of cereal "icing" the way it coats each piece.<br /><br />Regardless, I'm not disappointed in the product per se, we're still using it, and my dog has no complaints.

review/summary: Great- no artificial sweeteners at all !
review/text: I can't do artificial sweeteners (medical issues), so was so pleased to find a naturally low calorie sweetened drink mix.  There is a very slight aftertaste, but nothing as bad as the artificially sweetened stuff.  It dissolves very quickly, and is a nice change from plain water.  I am most fond of the grape, which is odd, as I don't generally go for grape flavored drinks of other types.  The lemonade is also good.  Much more healthy than the Monsanto-based aspartame products.

review/summary: It may be cat food, but my dogs love it.
review/text: After noticing my dogs LOVE to eat from cat bowls of friends/neighbors, I got them some. I've generally heard that ~most~ cat foods are richer than most dog foods, so if true, that makes sense why dogs like it too. Although you may be able to feed cat food to dogs, you're not supposed to give dog food to cats. I don't want them getting doggy gout from overly rich food, so I trained them to understand that they can split one of these (2.75 oz plastic cup) AFTER they finish their regular dry food. I've given them Friskies too, which is a larger size (5 or 5.5 oz), and they love that too. One of the dogs grabs the cup and holds it in his paws and licks every last speck out. If they're happy, so am I.

review/summary: Cats love it but a powerful smell!
review/text: We decided our cars were getting a little hefty and wanted to switch them to wet food. We ordered this based on the ingredients being mostly fish and it being affordable compared to some of the other healthier cat foods. Our two female cats immediately devoured the first can, while the male cat gave us a mournful look like "Why did you foresake me??", we've since switched him to healthier dry food and he is happier. The one caveat with the whitefish and tuna flavor is that is has a very very powerful fish smell that seeps into your fingers and wafts through a kitchen and living room.

review/summary: Best Dark Mint Chocolate
review/text: This is fabulous chocolate - one of the only mint-flavored chocolate bars available that is at least 70% cocoa. However, for some reason a number of bars in the box that I received weren't terribly fresh. Some of the bars had that light, chalky color on the outside. This doesn't mean the chocolate has gone bad, just that it's been around for a while - though these older bars were also a bit more brittle than the newer ones. Maybe the company is having inventory problems, or manufacturing problems. I used to be able to get the Endangered Species dark chocolate mint at a couple of local stores, and then for several months none was available. That's when I decided to buy it online.

review/summary: REAL chocolate with a hint of mint
review/text: This is a nice bar.  It's about 1/4 inch thick and about 2 3/4 x 5 3/4 inches in size.  The 72% cocoa is nice because it is bittersweet without all the added sugar but not as harsh as the higher cocoa content ones.  The mint taste is light, just a hint of mint. The higher cocoa content like this bar is supposed to be good for you (but does not mean you should eat a whole lot.)  The bar says it has 2 servings, and honestly, half this bar is enough.  (I found that usually the first mouthfull satisfies the urge anyway.  So, unless you can afford all the calories, eat half the bar and put the rest away for another day---OR, better yet, share with friends.)<br /><br />Ingredients are nice--like real food (chocolate, beet sugar, vanilla, etc.--not a bunch of chemical names.  Only 12g sugar.  Also contains 3g protein and is 10% iron and 2% calcium.  10% of the profits are donated to help support species, habitat and humanity.  An all natural, 3 oz/85g product and it is delicious.

review/text: I've had quite a few mint chocolate candies in my life, and this is definitely my favorite.  Not only is the bar 70% chocolate, but it's not where it's a case of chocolate surrounding an overpoweringly sweet and minty center like the Ghirardelli ones.  The mint is actually infused into the bar, which makes it so delicious - you get a deep chocolate taste and subtle mint flavor in every bite!

review/text: This chocolate was absolutely amazing. It's rich and dark and creamy, definitely something a dark-chocolate lover would find a treasure to savor. The bars come in a neat little box in a design similar to what one typically sees in a chocolate containers for individual bars in markets. The outer paper wrapper contains some info on various environmental causes. Pretty nice.<br />Again, chocolate was better than I expected. I read reviews about how some people had aged, possibly expired, chocolate, but I went ahead and bought this and the expiration date was a year away and tasted great, so I was very pleased. It's dark chocolate, alright. Smooth and slightly bitter, just how I love it. The only problem I had was that it didn't have as much mint flavor as I would have liked. It's still there, alright, but it's just not very strong. Overall, these are some lovely chocolates.

review/text: I am a dark chocolate fanatic (and I mean a good brand, not Hershey's), and this brand's mint is my absolute favorite. It has just the right balance of silky, smooth dark chocolate and just the right amount of mint. I eat other brands also, but only because they have certain flavors that Endangered Species doesn't carry (such as orange). If they had all the flavors I like, I would buy only this brand.

review/text: Love these bars, great taste for high-cocoa chocolate mint. However, just had a package shipped and it was a melted and rehardened mess. It is cool where I live, but it was shipped from the east coast where it's been hot. I have to return them and then wait for a refund which is kind of a pain. So, I think I would only buy these online during cool weather in the future. However, the product itself, when it is shipped without incident, is great, my whole family enjoys them.

review/summary: Where is the flavor of the Rainforest
review/text: This is the third product by this company I have tried.  First was the one with the chimpanzee on the label.  Fine chocolate, but alas no chimpanzee flavor.  Then the one with a bat on the label.  Can you guess the outcome?  Again, the chocolate itself was good, but no flavor of bat!  So fine, I figured since trees are stationary and not moving like chimps and bats, maybe third time is a charm.  Perhaps there is some sort of exotic Brazilian wood flavor in this chocolate.  So, I bite into it..and what do I taste?  Chocolate and mint!  Now who knows, maybe the mint leaves was lugged about by some native in the rainforest.  But really now, a forest is the trees!  Even if the mint was grown in the Amazon, that's not what I expect at all!  I want this chocolate bar to taste like honest to god wood!<br /><br />Well, I was fooled again.  Chimpanzee chocolate bar, no chimp flavor.  Bat chocolate bar, no bat flavor.  Rainforest chocolate bar, no tree flavor.  So again I am forced to give an otherwise quality product one star.  It's a shame, if they would stop their false advertising and just advertise this as a mint chocolate bar, I'd give it four or even five stars.  I'm not normally a fan of mint but I did like this chocolate bar.  Or would have if it had tasted like a tree!
