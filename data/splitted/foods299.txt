review/summary: Not as advertised
review/text: Rice noodles taste pretty much alike, but this is the second time I have ordered rice noodles from Amazon in the last two weeks only to discover they are not as advertised on the website. In this case the website states that these noodles are made in the US. They are not. The box states they are a product of Thailand. I do not appreciate this misrepresentation at all.

review/summary: Very Poor Quality Tung Ting: No Fragrance, No Taste
review/text: All the times I have had Tung Ting tea, from many different sources, the leaves have been a lovely green, yielding an infusion from pale yellow to gold with a deeply floral character, much more complex and mysterious than jasmine tea, although with tung ting it is the smell of the leaves themselves, no flowers. In fact this is the general characteristic of Formosan teas.<br /><br />Typically, the first infusion can be very sweet with the pronounced floral qualities presenting themselves more with each subsequent infusion.<br /><br />Well, sometimes you get what you pay for. This stuff appears to be quite old and of poor quality to start with. The leaves are dry and brown, not fresh looking and greenish. There was not expiration date and the box is not air tight, the bag inside is not sealed.<br /><br />The leaves have no fragrance at all, and the tea was brown with about 2% of the normal floral character or sweetness. Actually it tasted more like the very cheap oolong tea at the tiny tea houses in the outer Sunset district, S.F. where the tea is free with the $1 fried bread.<br /><br />I would spend just a little more from one of the reputable companies on Amazon like Tao of Tea, and get what you pay for. Thank you.

review/summary: Incredible soda!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: I first came across Ramune in college when the student union started selling it.  I was instantly hooked!  First, it tastes really good and comes in a variety of unique flavors (at least unique in the US).  Secondly, it comes in a very unique package which is fun to open and use.  I never got to try all of the flavors, but I remember really liking melon, green grape, and strawberry.  I'm very happy to find that Amazon is selling them.  I only wish they were sold in cases.  Give it a try.  You won't regret it.

Kids will definitely love this.<br /><br />Just try to figure out how to open it without checking the instructions!

review/text: Ramune is sure to refresh you and you can never get enough of it! The bottle is very unique and there are many designs. Most of them focus on the same principal. Push the marble down in the bottle with the special peace of plastic, when drinking use the weird and unique curves to stop the marble from closing the bottle, and with some (Not one shown here) you can take the marble out once done. Over all it's a great price, everyone should try it, and you got nothing to loose when buying Ramune!

review/text: It was very hard to find a gum that does not use Aspartame. Even the "sugar" gums have this chemical in it. I found this product made the way we used to get gum, with sugar. Also, it has a very good taste and freshens breath. The only draw back was there wasn't very much "juice" in the center, not like it was when I was younger. That's ok, because I would rather that than the Aspartame.

review/summary: Best sauce (except my own of course!)
review/text: My husband made me get this when we first moved in together 3 years ago while being stationed in Charleston, SC. He's originally from Florida so he was, needless to say, obsessed with Sonny's. First used it while I was making ribs for the first time. OMG I almost died! This sauce was amazing! I totally agree with the other reviewer saying that this sauce has ruined any other sauce for me! Now I still make my own BBQ sauce, but it is a totally different style sauce (vinegary and thin with lots of onions and celery chunks and a bit on the spicy side).<br />Now we live in Las Vegas and the distance makes it hard for us to find the sauce locally, which sucks because I used it for everything! Baking chicken breasts in it, on turkey sandwiches, in burgers, on meatloaf, I even add it to the Velvita  Zesty BBQ dinner to get more of that yummy BBQ flavour!

review/text: I love Sonny's Sweet Bar-B-Que sauce and haven't found it locally here in Alaska. I ordered four gallons, which came fairly quickly, but was marked "damaged" by the USPS. The shipping box did not show any physical damage or deformity, but there was sauce on the outside of the box under the clear wrapping tape.  When I opened the shipping box, two of the four gallon containers of sauce had split seams that allowed the sauce to leak out.  The four gallon containers had no padding around them internally and were a tight fit into the shipping box.

review/text: The manufacturer, Faerie's Finest, has confirmed with me, that there are "TRACE ELEMENTS" in this product that may cause an allergic reaction.  I have been using this product for some time now and really like it and I wanted to make a peanut butter flavored cake for a friend who has allergies to peanuts, so I called the manufacturer as to what the actual ingredients are.  I waited almost 2 weeks for an answer.  I finally had to call them back and had to wait for the owner to reply later in the day.  The person answering the phone read me the ingredients stating there were natural ingredients but this is NOT WHAT THE LABEL STATES. The label says ARTIFICIAL flavors. But she "assured" me it "should be fine"!!  I waited to hear from the owner/manufacturer.  When I got the call back I was informed that the ingredients were naturally derived and contained trace elements that may cause an allergic reaction!  I am SO GLAD I CALLED!  The labeling is not accurate and poses a severe health risk to those with peanut allergies.  The product should be discontinued/recalled until proper labeling can be established.  Otherwise - if you have no allergy to nuts it is a good extract.

review/summary: Original Idea---Kombucha from a Tea!
review/text: *****<br />This Organic Green Tea Kombucha from Yogi Tea is certainly unique. It tastes like a mixture of passion fruit, plum, ginger, and green tea. It is mild, and not bitter at all, even when you leave the tea bag in the whole time you drink the tea, as I do. Best of all, it is an easy, convenient way of benefiting from Kombucha, if you don't grow your own (and I don't anymore, as it is not easy or convenient for me). I have never before obtained my Kombucha from a tea; this is a tasty way to do so.<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with this tea and with Yogi Teas in general. Organic Green Tea Kombucha comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: "Green Tea Kombucha is based on an ancient remedy and offers a convenient form of Kombucha designed for daily use. Legend has it that some 2,000 years ago, Kombucha originated in Russia, and from there it traveled to Japan. Since then it has been used to detoxify the body, enhance the immune system, fight fatigue and soothe an upset stomach. This special healing formula is made with  Organic Green Tea (Camellia sinensis), which is organically grown and, unlike other green teas, has a delicate flavor with no bitterness. Green Tea has excellent antioxidant properties. To it we have added a concentrated purified extract of Kombucha-Pure(tm), which is produced without the use of refined sugar or black tea, and is made from Kombucha grown in a unique medium of 32 supporting Chinese herbs. The recipe is complemented with Organic Spearmint, which can help to relax the body and aid digestion; Organic Licorice Root, to support the adrenals and enhance the effects of other healing herbs; and Dong Quai Root, a well-known tonic. Once the benefits of these ingredients are released by hot water, you are ready to enjoy a delicious, delightful and soothing cup of tea - and one that is naturally rich in antioxidants and other health-supporting qualities."<br /><br />Yogi Tea's use of "Kombucha-Pure", grown in 32 Chinese herbs and WITHOUT black tea or sugar is very, very appealing, and a new and exciting way of producing Kombucha.<br /><br />Note that Yogi Tea also makes a decaf version of this tea that has exactly the same ingredients except that the organic green tea is decaffeinated---naturally, of course!<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Not what I had hoped for
review/text: This tea is okay but not what I had hoped for.  Seems as though low quality tea leaves were used as there is a definite lack of depth to the flavor.  If left to steep for a much longer time than normal, flavor develops, but it is not what I've had with other brands.  I wouldn't really recommend this brand if you love this type of tea.

review/summary: Heaven in a teacup
review/text: The roasted brown rice in this tea adds a distinctive flavor that can't be compared with anything. I love to start my day with a cup of this tea...the aroma...the exquisite taste. Mmmmmm. I had to drive far to find this tea at a Japanese store in Seattle, and now I am thrilled that I can get it conveniently through Amazon. Yamamotoyama makes this in tea bags, also, but I think the loose leaf version is much richer. The tea bags are nice to take along in your pocketbook, though.

review/summary: good fresh-smelling tea reasonably priced
review/text: I was skeptical because of the economical cello packaging, but ordered anyhow. The tea was fresh as new cut hay, brewed nicely in a filter-cup. Pleasant golden hue to the drink. The brown rice adds a mild popcorn aroma I quickly got used to, and now like. I can see why green tea with toasted rice is a favorite beverage in Japan!<br /><br />Less caffine than coffee, won't stain teeth like coffee, and has health promoting qualities ... do try.<br /><br />BTW, read a study that coffee can lower IQ by 10 points, but tea does not.<br /><br />Since you aren't supposed to sugar your tea,(it ruins the subtle experience of a brew) you save many calories, too. Taste it plain first. (steep 3 minutes only - you can brew a second time)<br /><br />My purchase lasted for months in an airtight plastic storage jar. It's even decorative (like dry beans or pasta in a jar).

review/summary: Steep It Only Briefly
review/text: Green tea is my favorite tea--and of green teas, genmai is the one I find most delicious.  It's almost sweet, has a bit more body and a less sharp taste than the typical "green tea" you get here in the US.  This one has some of the qualities of a good Genmai tea, but do not steep it for long or it will become quite bitter.  With a brief steeping it is smooth and flavorful.  You can probably get at least two, maybe three, steepings per serving.

review/summary: Expensive but delicious!
review/text: I brought these as a result of my desire to add "good" nuts to my daily diet.  I had been purchasing the Planter's "energy" mix but they were out of stock so I thought I'd give these a try.  They are fresh and delicious with whole nuts - the walnut pieces are very large (two bites at least).  The mix seems to be mostly almonds and walnuts, which is fine with me because those are good nuts for you.  Unlike the Blue Diamond smoked almonds, these nuts aren't overly salty, which is a plus for me!  On the downside, the little sticky paper that they include to "reseal" the package (after opening) doesn't work very well - I ended up putting the nuts into a container to keep them fresh because the package wouldn't stay closed after I opened it.

review/text: This tray makes a perfect monkey platter for a toddler! Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some brown rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that. The monkey platter approach is a great way to encourage small children to try a wide variety of foods without overwhelming them and this tray is PERFECT. It's also cute and easy to clean.

review/summary: Works, but expensive
review/text: Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.

review/summary: Great product but not airtight
review/text: This product is a must-have for any parents making their own baby food and looking for an easy and convenient freezer storage solution. The 7 compartments can hold 2 oz each and the frozen food easily slips out of each compartment, thanks to the flexible silicone.<br />The only downside to this product, is that the plastic lid isn't airtight, despite claims that it is exactly that. Instead of the lid snapping onto the tray all around the edge and closing tightly, it only clicks into place in 5 different places, allowing air to get in and resulting in freezer burn. To prevent this I plastic wrap the tray before putting the lid on.

review/text: I am a mom concerned about BPA and wanted to find something I could safely use in the freezer, and found this one among others and I liked that this one came with a lid and they style of it is pretty cool.  The only thing I don't like is that when I am freezing things that are more dense, like my homemade rice pudding, they are hard to push out when they are still in their frozen form.  When I freeze the same thing in a traditional ice tray, I don't seem to have that problem (I think because it is flexible rather than ridged, the tray flexes rather than releasing the food)...  things that are more watery like frozen juice are not as hard to get out.  Over all, I like it, and it makes really fun round popcicles!

review/summary: Great product, but carries a bad odor
review/text: I have the Beaba baby food maker and two of the trays.  I also use my food processor to make food.  I have twins and make a lot of organic food to freeze.  I freeze the food in the trays and then transfer then to FoodSaver bags so they never get freezer burned.  The one thing I HATE about the trays is that they have a weird, unpleasant odor to them.  The odor does not smell like the foods I stored in them.  For the most part, I wash them by hand. I tried soaking them in vinegar and figured the steam from the dishwasher might help, but nothing gets rid of the odor.  When I first got the trays, I had to run hot water over them to pop the food out.<br /><br />Now that I've been using them for a while, I can easily pop the food out without water.  I do try to transfer the food as soon as possible b/c the seal on the trays is not perfect and freezer burn can happen if you let them sit for too long.  I do feel the trays are overpriced.  I have 2 trays and could easily use 2-4 more to freeze the batches I make.  It's annoying to have to keep rotating the food to try to freeze it before it goes bad.

review/summary: LOVE THIS PRODUCT!
review/text: We have 6 of these trays in various colors.  My husband and I both work and make our daughter's baby food instead of buying jars.  We make large batches on the weekends and having multiple trays allows us to make a variety of foods that we can then combine when defrosted during the week.  I love that they stack neatly in the freezer, have a lid (which a lot of other baby food trays don't have), and the frozen portions pop out easily.  Another reviewer wrote they use it as a serving tray for baby instead of many bowls--I will most certainly try that when baby is ready to feed herself.<br /><br />As a tip...the lid isn't completely airtight (as other mentioned) so I wouldn't recommend leaving the food in the tray until you're ready to serve.  We pop food portions out after freezing over night and store in labeled bags.  This is very handy for grabbing foods quickly.

review/summary: Easy to get food out
review/text: I have several types of baby food molds and this is my favorite. It is soft and rubbery so I am able to push up from the bottom of the mold to remove the food. I don't like having to run hot water over the back, like I have to with my other molds, because I don't like tap water getting on the food. (I'm a little obsessive, compulsive) Just make sure not to fill the molds all the way to the top because the food expands and then you'll have food on the lid. Makes for easier cleaning if you don't get food on the lid.

review/summary: Total waste of money
review/text: I am a total sucker for kitchen gadgets, but this just goes too far. The price is insane for what is essentially a glorified ice cube tray, which does not work as well as your basic ice cube tray. It's difficult to get the cubes out of this tray, it has an odd shape that wastes space in your freezer, and it makes 2 ounce servings, which are fine if you know you want 2 ounces, but I prefer to make 1 ounce sizes so that I can combine different flavors, or make just 1 (or 3) ounces if my baby is not as hungry and I don't want any waste. The only reason I gave it any stars at all is because of the lid - that IS handy, I must admit. But you can buy ice cube trays with lids too, that will actually fit in your freezer and stack well. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. Okay, it IS cute. I wish it wasn't so cute...

review/summary: One of my favorite baby products
review/text: The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is one of our favorite baby products.  We use a steamer and a food processor to make baby food.  We put the food in one of these freezer trays, freeze for a couple of hours, and then pop the food out and store it in the freezer in Ziplock bags, labeled with the type of food and the date.<br /><br />I saw a previous comment that the serving sizes were too large.  Um, no they are not.  If you want less - don't fill the cup all the way.  Crazy how that works!  I fill the cups to the top, and my son eats almost the entire serving.  I am glad that the cups are as big as they are.<br /><br />Clean up is a breeze - we don't put it in the dishwasher, we just run it under hot water.<br /><br />To prepare the frozen cubes, I pop them in the microwave for 15 seconds - then stir.  Another 15 seconds, and another stir.  Sometimes, another 10 seconds if I want to serve it warm.<br /><br />Great product for those who want to make cooking their own baby food even easier.

review/summary: Worth the expensive price
review/text: I bought this product because I needed freezer trays and was trying to use up the remainder of a gift card I had. Im glad that I had the gift card to go towards this product because I know that it is very expensive. here are the reasons that I enjoy this product:<br /><br />1) I use it often, every 3-6 days. If I think about it like that then I feel like Im really getting my moneys worth<br />2) The silicone makes it not only easy to clean and durable but a breeze to pop food out without having to worry about breaking the device<br />3) I like that it has a lid, and for the most part I really feel like they did the best that they could to make the lid fit on properly and snuggly<br />4) The size of the cubes are perfect for my needs. they are a good helping size and I never need to feed my baby anymore at one sitting. I dont waste a lot of food, if any, and my baby doesnt leave wanting more<br /><br />suggestions to this product and its use:<br /><br />1) I have a small freezer, its not standard size and therefore things freezer burn in my freezer at double the rate. Due to this issue that has nothing to do with the product, I overfill these cubes so that the top is touching the lid and no freezer burn is able to form before I can transfer them over into a freezer bag<br />2) because the cubes are bigger I thaw them out the night before in my refridgerator so that by midday they are thawed all the way through and i can easy heat the food evenly from there.<br /><br />I gave this a four instead of five stars simply because they could have devised a snap lock lid system for the money they are charging and made this an overall outstanding item and also because the price point is a little high, Im sure that its not even close to that much money to put together some silicone! i think baby items should be reasonably priced so that even those that are a little less fortunate can enjoy quality baby products such as a way to freeze food.

review/summary: I love these, price aside
review/text: I got these as gifts and absolutely love them. Yes, you can use ice cube trays to freeze baby food & other things but these are so much more convenient for me since they're = a jar of baby food, plus the reason I really love them is that I have continued to use them all the time after we were done with purees. I have 19 month old twins & made all their purees & continue to make a lot of their food and freeze things ahead for easy defrost & prep at the end of my work day when we get home & they're starving.  I'm not sure why another person was trying to scoop the portions out with a spoon (?) but all you have to do is run hot water over the back side for about 30 sec and everything pops out no problem. I have the same issue w/ ice cube trays so I don't really understand the issue others have reported.<br />So, in addition to purees, I have frozen things like the following in these to = 1/2 or full portion sizes for my kids (depending on how old they were, obviously I need to defrost more of them as they get older): risottos, ground beef/turkey, small meatballs & sauce, mac & cheese, small portions of elbow macaroni (when they were younger & couldn't eat as much), and anything else really that can be smooshed into the container. These are things that would not work in an ice cube tray & freezing in a million containers or one big one is not practical, at least for me.<br /><br />It's too bad they're not a little more affordable but I do think they're great.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: I have two.  I like this product for a few reasons and dislike it for only one reason.  This is a good product because it gives you perfect 2oz portions.  It is easy to clean and store and fit in the freezer.  The only down side is that the plastic scent is a bit strong and sometimes the food scent stays on it even after I wash it in the dishwasher.  Maybe it is because I do not take them out once they freeze and place them in ziplock bags.  I just leave the food in and take 1 or 2 out at a time.  I still make and store my little one her apple sauce even though she is a finger food baby and not a puree baby anymore.  I still use this product and recommend it.

review/summary: Used it twice, won't use it again
review/text: This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!

review/summary: Great little freezer tray for baby food
review/text: The Beaba freezer tray is flexible and very easy to clean. It has seven slots which is a good amount of storage for a week worth of 2oz puree portions. I make a lot of food for my 9 month old boy and I like to use this tray to store various fruit purees. The top closes securely and feels like it wouldn't come off if dropped.

review/summary: GREAT BABY FOOD STORAGE!!!
review/text: I was just making my 7 month old son some brocolli baby food when I realized I hadn't written a review for the Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray.  I have two of them and I absolutely love them.  I make the baby food then freeze it.  If I have too much food and not enough tray space, I freeze some and then pop them out and put them in another tubberware container.  Whenever it is time for him to eat.  I pop one out, put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and we are good to go.  I even freeze my homemade rice cereal which makes it so much easier.  I would recommend this product because it is easy and cleans really well.

review/summary: Useful but not perfect--and pricey
review/text: I like this item because it enables you to freeze baby food in larger portions than ice-cube trays, which is a good thing if your baby is a little pig like mine is.  My biggest complaint is that it is difficult to get the frozen items out of the tray once they are done.  I usually have to run it under hot water for a few minutes, which is not a big deal but just one more step.  Also, the price is very high for what this is.  I could use a second one but at this price I'll make due with the one I've got.

review/text: This is the perfect storage for the baby food I make at home. I am a working mom, so time is not on my side when it comes to doing things for my son. But, it's important for me to make him healthy homemade meals and this container helps me by allowing me to make large batches of food on the weekends and fill them up for the freezer. I have 2 of these storage containers that are kept in the freezer with the food I prepare on the weekends. Each night, I pull out my son's food for the following day and allow it to thaw in the fridge. The flexible material makes it really easy to pop out one portion at a time. Highly recommend this food storage.

review/text: My daughter wanted 3 of these so she could make my 1st grandbaby her food. I bought them and then 3 boxes of the One Step reusable stackable Fresh and Freeze as i thought the latter would be better.<br />These are hard to remove when frozen and you end up touching the other sections and contaminating them. You have to run hot water over the section you want to remove. You cannot see thru the lid if you put different food in a container.<br />These are way too expensive when you can buy the other Fresh and Freeze by One Step Ahead that can go from the freezer, microwave then the dishwasher.<br />I do not recommend wasting your $$$ when yoy can have the same results with ice cube trays covered to freeze than placing them in baggies. Idea is to make the food freeze it and leave it until ready to use:)

review/summary: Great for larger portions
review/text: These are great for making larger portions of baby food. I think I'll use them more as my baby gets older. For my 7-month-old, one cube makes about 2-3 servings of food for her. I love that it has a cover, and the silicone makes it really easy to pop the food out. But, it's pretty pricey for just 7 slots of food, and the fewer slots make it harder to mass-produce baby food unless you buy multiples of the trays.

review/summary: Great for things other than baby food as well
review/text: My baby isn't born yet so I haven't used this for baby food yet, but I HAVE used it for freezing homemade chicken stock. I just filled the 2 ounce cups, popped it into the freezer and then stuck the frozen segments into a ziplock and then repeated. It makes the perfect-sized little portions and is extremely easy to use. I love how flexible the silicone is and am looking forward to finding other uses for this. I would highly recommend this to anyone, not just those wanting to use it for baby food.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated, it is not airtight so it could get freezer burn. But I have never had this issue and you can avoid it as well by simply transferring the portions to a freezer bag once it's frozen. If you are looking for a container to hold what you make in the freezer indefinitely, this is not the product for you.<br /><br />I like this so much, in fact, I would have purchased a second or even third one for convenience if it weren't for the price. Once my baby is old enough, I have a feeling I will be investing in another though.

review/summary: I Love These Trays!!!!!!!
review/text: I have been making my baby food since she was 6 months old.  These trays are fantastic and allow me to make large batches of baby food and freeze for reheating throughout the week.  I originally purchased two trays, but my 8 month old baby is eating two servings for lunch and dinner, so I ordered two more trays.  Not only are they colorful and fun, but so easy to clean and the frozen baby food pops right out after running the tray under warm water for a few seconds.  Although these trays are kind of expensive, they are totally worth the money if you only feed your baby homemade food.  I wish that these trays would have been on the market back when my son was a baby, as I had the entire door of my freeze full of small tupperwear with baby food and these trays would have made my life easier back then.  By the way, if you want to save more space in your freezer, you can just pop the baby food out of the trays and store in a freezer bag.  I absolutely love them and I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I bought the Beaba freezer trays along with the Beaba Babycook. Initially I thought why on earth did I spent that money?? However, after making baby food for three months, I can say it was totally worth it.<br />The trays are indeed expensive, but they are far superior to your average ice cube tray. If you do not overfill it, the frozen food does pop out super easy. It is BPA free, so safe for baby. And it lasts a lot longer than a normal ice tray, which I also use to freeze my baby food if I run out of the beaba ones (I freeze in batches).<br />Just a great product, and it has helped making my daughter's food a lot of fun and super simple.

And it's always being used...I love it!!!

review/summary: Baby Food Freezer tray
review/text: We have a friend that recommended this to us.  She makes her own baby food and freezes it in this tray for use later.  We will give it a whirl when our baby arrives.  It seems like a well made product.  It looks like it is good for BIG Jello-shots too!

review/summary: Easy to use
review/text: This is by far the easiest way I've found to freeze baby food and get it out again. The getting it out again is key - it can be really hard to get frozen puree out of ice cube trays without cracking the tray. It's also dishwasher safe. The only drawback is that it doesn't prevent freezer burn so if that's a concern for you, you'll need to put it inside of a freezer bag.

review/summary: awesome
review/text: I don't know who would review this poorly. It is great. After you freeze it, you just push the portions out and they come out clean. I love that it is non-toxic, easy to use, easy to clean, and that I can have freezer bags of small portions of baby food prepared and ready to use whenever. I hesitated to buy it because of poor reviews, but am very happy I got it. I am using it every other day right now.

review/summary: crappy lid
review/text: The lid merely sits on the top, and is a huge pain to get on and off, especially since we use this to freeze milk. Half the time it spills everywhere while I'm moving it to the freezer. Sooo annoying but at least the bottom is silicon. It will be useful for baby food and less-liquid things.

review/summary: Not worth the money
review/text: I bought one of these thinking I would try it out and go back for more if it worked out.  They are cute, but I won't be buying more.  The Stay-Fresh Baby Food containers are MUCH better and cheaper.  The Stay-Fresh containers each hold 2 ounces and can go straight in the microwave.  Once the food is frozen I find it difficult sometimes to get the portion of food out of the Beaba container.  Not the best design and totally overpriced.

review/summary: Fantastic!
review/text: I absolutely love these Beaba Multiportion Freezer Trays!!! They are wonderful for children, grandchildren of several age levels. My daughter and I are using them for her 3 mo. old for home made food. We prepare food, portion out, and chill or freeze and needed. We can mix multiple items in one tray and it is ready for the babysitter to use.<br /><br />I love the soft bottoms because we can pop out the frozen portions we need. I love the close fitting top which keeps in freshness. I wish I'd had these when my girls were little<br /><br />We also use these as carry along snack trays for the 3 1/2 year old. She gets to choose and portion her snacks for the day. Wonderful!

review/summary: Not just for baby food!
review/text: I am just so in love with these trays!  I now have four!!!  I have used them for baby food and have even whipped up a batch of pesto and frozen it.  Once your food is frozen, they literally just pop right out!  I couldn't be happier with these!

review/summary: Terrible food pods
review/text: These food trays are terrible. I requested them in my baby registry, and thank god I only got one. It is very very difficult to scoop the frozen food out, and frozen food even bends spoon if you try to spoon it out. I'm donating it first thing in the morning. I highly recommend purchasing single food pods that you can just toss into a lunch bag and go, and defrost independently wherever you are.
