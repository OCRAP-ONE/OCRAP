review/summary: Satisfactory for store-bought pods
review/text: I have been most impressed with both my super-fast Senseo single-serve and its coffee pods. But no, the coffee does not taste as good as that I freshly grind. I realize that is an option if I want to produce my own pods but that would defeat the undeniable convenience of the single-serve machine. The coffee produced by this pod arrangement is happily strong - with this Dark Roast; I haven't yet tried any others - and the crema is wonderful, over and over. I do pre-wet the pods before brewing. I guess I could also wet down the machine parts. And I do heat non-fat or 1% milk in the microwave, then brew directly into that cup. This procedure mixes moo and joe quite adequately.<br /><br />There is some aspect to the taste of the brew that does not please me - not sure I can put it into words well. I think it is partly due to the inevitable not-entirely-freshness of the pods. In addition there is some kind of harshness that seems intended to masquerade as richness. Duh? Maybe someone more knowledgeable about coffee prep can identify it better. I do not see anywhere on the package that these coffee pods are 100% Arabica. Could that be it? But for the convenience and cost, I cannot complain TOO much. I am really happy with the purchases.<br /><br />Want to say a word of thanks to other reviewers who have made helpful suggestions and observations. Here's one I've found through experimentation: There is still strength left in the pod after one brewing. I've started re-using them. The method depends upon my coffee needs at the moment. Sometimes I install the 2-cup holder in the machine and re-use one with a new one. Then I end up with two used ones, and darned if they don't have another use in them. Maybe you won't like this but it is an option to try if you wish. (By comparison, I've found there is absolutely no value in the used grounds after I've brewed a pot of drip.) By the way, the used pods still produce a fine crema; whether this is due to the pods or the well-designed machine I do not know.

review/summary: Good, but not quite the same as in Holland
review/text: I have been drinking Senseo coffee Dark Roast over the last 8 years. I always loved the strong taste and the creamy layer. This was while I was living in the Netherlands.<br />A few months ago I moved to the US. I decided to continue my habit. I bought an American Senseo coffeemaker and American Senseo coffee pods (Dark Roast). Although the coffee still tastes a lot better than any other coffee I have tasted in the US (including Starbucks!), the taste still isn't quite the same as in the Netherlands. I even switched over to using bottled water instead of tap water. It did improve the taste some, but not enough to make me forget the taste of Senseo coffee in the Netherlands.<br />Mind you...I am still quite happy to be living in the US. There is plenty of stuff to make up for the taste of my coffee :).

review/text: Subscribe and save, you won't be sorry. The options in monthly delivery are so convenient, I used a coupon code and saved 40% on my pods, can't beat it with a stick. For a stronger coffee blend, take the pod out and steep for a minute, I am going to try different variety packs to get the most out of the deal, the dark roast is good, but I think I can do better. Most complaints I see are the strength of the coffee variety, the steeping trick works, there is coffee left in the pod, also, if your not rushed try blending the coffee with the pod between two cups.

review/summary: Simple dark roast coffee
review/text: I titled my review "simple dark roast coffee" because that's exactly what it makes. There is very little complexity to this coffee, no layers of flavor. And for some strange reason, it fails to create a crema/foam in the cup. I purposely use the espresso insert in my maker in order to get the crema, I just run the pods 3 times to get a proper cup. This pod fails to create the foam and that is a little disappointing. But the taste is good and I enjoy my cup every morning.

I found the website selling the 'original' world's largest gummy bear, and was ready to buy it until I figured I'd check amazon just in case, saved myself over $10 including shipping!<br />My family got it well on time, and even though they live in Texas, had no issues with smush face like some other customers have. They even sent a little finger puppet. My brother loved it, everyone was pleased, would definitely recommend it.

So, I decided to get her one for Christmas.  After reading the reviews, I was a little reluctant to spend $10 on something I thought would end up in the trash.  However, it was a big hit!  Does it taste like the small, high quality gummy bears? No, but, it did have a good texture and a decent taste.

It's a convenient way to empty out some cabinet space, and of course it fits any tea bag brand that dispenses from an upright box. The cost of the rack when the tea is factored out is around $10, which sounds about right. The only annoyance is that on both of the ones I've purchased, the Stash sign is crooked. Since it's just a cardboard sign affixed to a wire rack, this should be easy to do. Talk to your supplier about quality control, Stash!

review/summary: Tasty Treat, Low in Calories.
review/text: We tend (perhaps try would be a better word) not to have a lot of snacks around the house, mainly because we tend to eat them and they can add a lot of extra calories to a diet, if you're not careful. However, a few things seem necessary and we try to make those occasional treats relatively healthy, or at least relatively harmless. Thus it is that my wife found these Stretch Island Fruit Co "Fruit Leathers" in our local warehouse club store. It was the large variety pack, as is illustrated here.<br /><br />It was quite a sizable package, but we've gradually reduced them down to the last dozen or so and will shortly be getting another pack. We use them as snacks, pack them in my lunch, take them along camping and find other uses. Our boy is just starting to teethe, and I suppose he'll have fun with them. I rather like them as snacks except for the fact that they tend to stick to my teeth for a long time after eating. However, these "Fruit Leathers" are a tasty treat that's low in calories.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

The other one was a mess, only 46-count and random amounts of each of the flavors (for example, 17 cherry, 3 grape!)......... don't know what's up with that.  The leathers are great and I'd give them 5 stars but I was upset one package wasn't as specified.

review/summary: Great healthy snack alternative
review/text: I remember eating fruit leather when I was a little kid, so I have been searching for a brand to try again. I thought this variety pack was a great deal and a good chance to test drive a lot of different flavors at once. I am very pleased with the product. The leathers that I have eaten so far have been fresh and soft. I have definitely found some flavors to be stronger then others. For example, the apricot is definitely a softer, subtler flavor. I also found it interesting that even flavors I was expecting not to like, I really did. I have a problem eating anything grape and or cherry flavored because all I can think about are those horrible tasting cough medicines you take as a kid that always seem to come in either grape or cherry. However, I was pleasantly surprised at both these flavors, the grape is even one of my favorites! I love that these are healthy sweet treats, and so easy to grab on the go. Let's face it, eating fruit all day is a great idea, but running to catch a train with peach juice dripping down your arm, not a good look. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who wants an easy, healthy, on the go snack. (Also, a great way to sneak fruit to children, its like a healthy, real fruit, fruit by the foot)

review/text: My daughter is in college and she still lives at home and I have a 10-year old son. My daughter brought one of these home from campus and my son liked them too.  Ordered them because I did some research and saw that they charge a small ransom for these things.  They are very good and I was impressed by the flavor range.  I happen to love Apricot anything so this one is by  far the favorite.<br /><br />I do not have a Costco membership yet but I order so many other things for Amazon and get Free Shipping that the price factor does not really matter.<br /><br />For a low-sugar snack, these are great and I highly recommend them!

review/summary: True Variety of Flavors, except for one!
review/text: When I recieved this, the box looked very wonderful. It was sorta convenient to put more strips in.<br /><br />Here are ALL my opinions of these flavors:<br /><br />Grape- Juicy like spring. 3rd favorite.<br />Strawberry- Sorta realistic. Least favorite.<br />Mango- NOT INCLUDED. You have to buy that flavor seperately, but sweet.<br />Cherry- Tangy and 2nd Favorite.<br />Apricot- Much more tangier.<br />Raspberry- May have little seeds, but safe.<br />Apple- #1 Favorite. Sour as a Granny Smith.<br /><br />If it's your 1st time and you want all the flavors, then definately buy this along with a box of Mango.

review/summary: Yum !  And diabetic friendly :)
review/text: These are really good !  Most dried/concentrated fruits are a nightmare with blood sugar control, but these worked out just fine. The flavors are really good, and I'm glad I got the variety pack, as two of the flavors I hadn't planned to order in individual packages have turned out to be favorites (grape and apple).  Don't expect anything pretty as far as the inside 'organization'... the individual fruit leathers are just sort of thrown in there- but that didn't bother me since I was putting them in a snack container anyway.<br />Flavor breakdown -and opinion :)<br />Grape- strong Concord grape flavor- very good<br />Apple- like eating apple cider- very  good<br />Strawberry- good strawberry flavor- good<br />Cherry- mild cherry flavor- pretty good<br />Apricot- good apricot flavor- good<br />Raspberry- had to look at the package to figure it out- thought it was strawberry- but still good<br /><br />If I buy the individual flavors, I will probably skip the raspberry since it wasn't that pronounced, but will definitely buy the others in the individual flavor packaging.  I may buy this variety pack again, especially if funds are too tight to get a bunch of flavors in the individual flavors.  :)

review/text: This is an awesome product! I was already hooked on these fruit leathers and bought them all the time out our local grocery and health food stores, but purchasing the variety pack was cheaper, easier and will last a bit longer than buying a few at a time. The fruit leathers are delicious, small/light and very easy to throw into a bag or purse for a snack. There is no grainy or gritty texture with this brand, and all of the flavors are true to the original fruit. Also, the box is fairly slim and easy to store, so it's well-packaged given how much is included in one lot. I will definitely be re-ordering.

review/text: Fresh fruit is not only expensive, it is also hard to always have on hand. I picked up a few of these fruit leather strips in a health food store a few weeks ago. Each flavor was very good and there is half a serving of fruit in each strip, but they were a little less than a dollar each. That's hella expensive to me so I came to terms with the fact that I wouldn't be able to have these fruit strips as a staple in my diet. That was until I saw that I could get 48 of them for $0.37 each! They arrived a lot earlier than scheduled and I'm very, very happy with my purchase! I would recommend trying them first before buying such a large quantity JIC.

review/summary: Great place to start with eating fruit leathers
review/text: I've never been a fan of fruit leathers. I always snack on fruit snacks at the office and I knew I needed healthier alternatives. I ran into an online article about healthy snacks and decided to try it. The first result from Amazon was the straberry flavored ones. After browsing for a bit, I decided to get this package instead so I can try out the different flavors. It came in a rather large packaging and I was surprised to feel how heavy it was. After trying them all, I think the straberry flavored one is the best, and the apricot and the cherry is the worst. I never liked cherry flavored candies (I prefer fresh cherries). Apricot just tastes very bland. At first, since I've never had a fruit leather, it was very hard and less sugary than the usual fruit snacks I've always had. However, as I started to eat more, I enjoyed them and I now usually have 3 to 4 sticks a day. My next purchase will be the straberry flavored ones for sure. Great product, great packaging, and 300% better for you than the other artificial fruit snacks from the groceries.

review/summary: Goes with EVERYTHING!!
review/text: I first bought some of this seasoning in a local large discount grocery store, in the large container, for under $6. After trying it out, I went back and bought six more bottles, to give to friends and family. My friends have become as addicted to this as I am. We use it on EVERYTHING! It is great with scrambled eggs, great on steamed vegetables (ANY KIND!), great on roasted chicken, pork, fantastic on fish (especially Tilapia). If you are looking for a GARLIC salt, buy a GARLIC salt, because Garlic is just one of many ingredients in this, and the garlic is subtle. This is my go-to spice, and with this great price on Amazon, (it costs a lot more direct from Pappy's, which is where I bought it last time) I have just purchased another three bottles, two for myself, and one for a friend that has tried it at my house and loves it. (locally, we can only buy the small bottles in retail stores. Unfortunately the discount food store no longer carries this particular type of Pappy's in the larger containers). If you want a garlic seasoning, go buy a garlic salt. If you want something that is just WOW...try this!

My childhood pets were always fed it, and they lived to 14 years or so, and so I thought it would be good for my kittens.<br /><br />Their fur was glossy and they appeared healthy, but they were always hungry after eating their assigned portion. I switched to an organic human-grade kibble and the kittens were contented after their portions. This told me that the food must have been filling the cats up, but not substantially enough to keep them full. Just as a human could fill up on rice and chicken nuggets and vitamins (the human equivalents of some of the ingredients) and be healthy, but not really feel contented in their bellies.<br /><br />This is less expensive than the organic food I buy them now, but they want to eat more so I don't know what the end cost really is. I like the idea of all of the vitamins in there, just as I would take a multi-vitamin, but I just wish that their bellies could keep full after eating. I probably won't go back to this kibble. I wish I could rate it higher for the vitamins, but these corn meal and by-product ingredient listings really explain my kittens lack of feeling full.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Lots of vitamins<br />* Left fur glossy<br /><br />CONS:<br />* Always begging for more food<br />* Corn meal and chicken by-products near the top of ingredient list (poor quality, not human grade)

review/summary: My cats really like it
review/text: Fortunately, my kittens have had no ill behaviors while eating this food like the previous reviewers cat. I mixed this in with my Purina Kitten Chow that my kittens were eating and the kittens seemed to really love it. My other two, one year old cats were also fond of "stealing" the kittens dry food instead of their usual Iams (where real chicken is the main ingredient), so this must be tasty. Usually, I just feed my cats dry food on a free choice basis and supplement with canned cat food and boiled chicken meat. My only gripe is this isn't a dry food that someone on a strict budget could likely readily afford on a regular basis for a number of cats. Otherwise, this is a good quality kitten food.

review/summary: Not a very good food.
review/text: My view of this product has changed since we have been feeding Halo; the cats seem healthier and happier.  The kitten's coat was getting very rough and now is smooth and silky.  I'm told that you should feed the best you can afford, and this food is expensive, but not very high-quality, as far as we could tell.  Plus, our kitten gained too much weight on it.

review/summary: Filler food is empty, leaves your cat always needing more
review/text: This review will make me sound really stupid, but whatever. I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it "healthy," instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage.

review/summary: Addictive, empty filler, but my cat went anorexic without it
review/text: My older cat, 4 years, got "hooked" on Hill's Science Diet Kitten formula when I brought a new kitten, along with a big bag of free S/D, home from the pound. [Prior to that, my well-adjusted cat would eat raw chicken, high quality canned foods, organic kibble--all the "good stuff"]<br /><br />Both cats thrived on S/D.  So much so that the kitten grew and grew and grew, into a hefty 9 pounds at 7 months. The 4 year-old cat began ignoring her own food and started eating the kitten's food.  She filled out, also, but to a nice adult weight of 6 pounds.<br /><br />Okay, so 2 months later the kitten is up to 10 pounds and can barely walk without panting.  She cannot stop eating this S/D stuff.  She's enormous, way bigger than her 4 year-old housemate.  I decide to switch back to the healthier food--like Innova Evo, which is 88% meat protein and grain free.  I also augment with superior wet food (the 100% organic, human grade stuff, along with raw chicken, etc).<br /><br />Kitten is okay with that switch--like a tiger she tears away at the raw chicken, gulps at the premium can food--but the older cat doesn't like it, although I do it very gradually over 3 months.  I sit with her, pet her, calm her...Yes, she does eat, just not much--a few kibble crunches, or a tablespoon of wet food.  [Cornell has over 300 studies on anorexic cats].<br /><br />A couple months go by and the kitten is looking better, not panting as much (and  2 pounds lighter) but our 4 year-old cat is now down to 2.9 pounds!  All her ribs show and she has bones where her shoulders are.  She looks like a cheetah that's been deprived of food.  No mater what food I put in front of her--dry, wet, kibble, shredded meat--she will only nibble bits and pieces, here and there.  Her fur has lost its glossy coat.<br /><br />The vet tells me I have to do something, anything, to stop the decline in my cat's health, even if it means feeding the crummy Science Diet Kitten food, Original Formula.<br /><br />I am two days into feeding the cat the S/D Kitten food.  She is wolfing this stuff down as if there's no tomorrow.  It makes me sad that she's become another S/D addict--it's that darn corn filler, converts to sugar and cats love it.  I know, I'd rather have her alive and eating this crud, then wasting to nothing away on more nourishing food.  At least I can console myself that the kitten KNOWS she's a feline and eats like one.

review/summary: My cats won't eat it
review/text: I was sent a bag of this with a litter of kittens I am fostering. At first I thought perhaps the kittens were just more interested in wet food, because they wouldn't eat this stuff. Then they discovered my own personal cats' food (a much, much less expensive brand), and they were grubbing on it! My own cats turned up their noses at the Science Diet, too.<br /><br />It may be fabulously nutritious, but that doesn't really matter if my cats refuse to touch it.<br /><br />My dog liked it, though.

I've only tried the lamb & sweet potato variety, but the dogs really seem to love them where they were just so-so on the EVO treats. My only complaint is that for the amount of treats you get they're expensive.

review/summary: Great dressing for salads, pasta, veggies, meat
review/text: I like the Pan Asian Sesame dressing from Ken's but was unable to find bottles of it in any of the grocery stores. I first tasted it a year ago in a hospital cafeteria and it came in a small individual-sized packet with a salad. I have been searching for it ever since. I found the individual packets on Amazon instead. The sauce is a little sweet, a little tangy, and has a wonderful sesame flavor. It is good on pasta, salads, raw or cooked vegetables, over grilled chicken, steak, pork or fish. I can imagine it would be awesome on stir fried foods after everything has cooked together in the wok. It has a shelf life of around 2 years so I'm sure I'll use up the 60 packets by then.

review/text: Once upon a time this was such a wonderful product.<br /><br />The old Chocolate Twizzlers were much stronger in many ways. Taste yes and also in product 'behavior'.... The old product was 'tough' to pull apart... it actually had a 'snap' to it... This new 'stuff' behaves more like play-dough -- really 'squishy' and not in a good way. :)<br /><br />All I want to know is who is responsible for such a blunder and have they been fired yet? (kidding / well sorta)<br /><br />Dave<br /><br />Okay... I can't believe they (may have) actually listened!  I got a letter from Nestle back in Dec 2011 that they've reversed their changes to this great product and to look for new packages that have the tag line NOW WITH THE CLASSIC TWIST...  Well being in the middle of a home sale / purchase and all that goes along with that ... Chocolate Twizzlers weren't at the top of my priority... However now I'm going out to find a bag with the new tag line and I'll report back ASAP.  With any luck this 1 star review will be reissued as a 5 star. ... Fingers crossed.

review/text: I, along with many others it seems, emailed Twizzlers when they changed their chocolate Twizzlers formula and made the twists with open ends.  I kind of forgot about it and converted to eating the strawberry ones because I just hated the new formula.  Well, they must have kept some kind of database because that was like several years ago and I just received a letter stating that due to consumer response they were bringing back the classic twist!  I also received a couple of coupons.  I must say I was impressed!  I did just find them in the store and they have the old shape back and I'm pretty sure the old taste too although the package still says "made with Hershey's syrup" and it didn't used to say that.  Another co-worker tried them and she too, thinks it is the old formula.  Thanks Hershey's!

review/summary: New classic are coming back
review/text: A few months ago I wrote a email to Hershey about the new taste of their chocolet twizzlers and I told them why did they change the taste of them. They told me that they did not know of any other complaints and also sent me some coupons so I can get some free bags. But I told them in another email that I did not need their coupons because I was not going to purchase them again. I told them that as a kid I always loved to eat them and enjoyed the taste. Why in the world would someone decide to change them and even the texture was horrible like jello...so a few days ago I receive a letter from Hershey telling me that because of my letter and other feed back from others they're now bringing back the chocolet twizzlers as the classic. They sent me some free coupons..they could not of made mt day....just hope that they are as good as the original and to make sure I buy the ones that say classic on them. I am truly glad that there is a least one company that listens to the consumer...

review/text: A few years ago Hershey's changed Chocolate Twizzlers from the traditional closed ended product to a softer, more chocolatey open ended one.  At first I was skeptical but after my first bag I realized that they knew what they were doing.  By comparison the old product was dry and had very little taste, and the new chewy Twizzlers had quickly become my favorite candy.  Unfortunately they have decided to go back to the old recipe, probably because it is cheaper to produce.  I can only hope that in time they will change back.

review/summary: Not as good as original, but still good!
review/text: True, these don't have the original chocolate twizzler texture or taste. The original had the same texture as the current strawberry twizzlers - firm, almost like plastic. The new ones are softer, squishier. The original had more of a dark chocolate taste; these are more milky, like chocolate pudding. I liked the originals better, but these are still very tasty.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: A friend brought me some chocolate twizzlers from Hershey Park and my family ate them so quickly that I hardly got any! I ordered these from Amazon and they tasted just like the ones from Hershey Park. Maybe the recipe was different a while back but I guess I never had those. I LOVE these! They are soft and very smooth to eat. Almost like chocolate pudding but in twizzler form. Highly recommend. :)

review/text: If you're serious abt chocolate you won't be impressed. The Initial bloom is weak but the follow-through is very good. However what faults the weakness of flavor may be they are compensated for by the texture: a perfectly luscious smooth moist chew.<br /><br /> Way better than you remember them from decades back and utterly different from their famous strawberry cousins which are by comparison dry brittle tasteless twigs.

review/summary: Bring back the original flavor!
review/text: The new recipe is horrible with a bizarre consistency and bland taste. I used to buy the original chocolate twizzlers two big boxes at a time. Then around 2007, I ordered a box and it had the Hershey's chocolate label on the individual packages. I thought that is alright, they must have purchased the company. Little did I know until I tasted one that they totally had changed the taste of the licorice. I ended up throwing out the whole box of 24 packages. I just could not eat it. I bought up all the original that I could on eBay but that source dried up so I have not had any since. Whoever made this decision at Hershey clearly should be fired. I wonder how their sales have changed on this product.
