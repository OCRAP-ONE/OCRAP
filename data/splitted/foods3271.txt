review/summary: Delicious, authentic Landjaeger
review/text: By all means every bit as tasty as Seattle's own Bavarian Meats Landjaeger.  Wisconsinmade's sausages have their own great flavor and firmness/texture and I really like them.  These folks even emailed me after I sent them feedback expressing my disappointment in the shipping costs for their product, and sent me an unsolicited partial refund for my troubles!  That's great customer service backing up their yummy snacks.

review/summary: delicious memory of switzerland
review/text: I've enjoyed this delicious meat on many visits to switzerland.  It's worth the hefty price, because it takes a lot of patience to make it.  a marvelous companion to raclette..................add a few little cornichons on the other side.  I see there's a California version for sale.  haven't yet tried that.  I'm afraid that it's not legal to import it from Switz.  who knows?  p.s. one must have the ability (probably machine) to slice it really really thin!)

review/text: I had the maui onion and garlic macadamias by the same company and they were so good I wanted to try more kinds. The chocolate coconut ones are at least as big as a whopper, maybe just a hair larger. But it's all chocolate. There's a little macadamia in the middle but it's nothing like a thin coat of chocolate over the nut that I was expecting. It's like 90% chocolate and 10% nut. It's not bad tasting by any means, I just expected a lot less chocolate.

So, if you have a tiny dog like Charlie do be sure to buy the mini version by this company.<br /><br />We broke these into little pieces and Charlie loves them.  He even takes the time to munch for a while on the whole biscuit!  We gave the second bag I ordered to a friend with a larger dog...Charlie's friend loves them too!<br /><br />PS...I am very particular about ingredients and compatibility with his other foods.

review/summary: Wonderful! Great for GAPS diet!
review/text: [This date sugar is cheaper if you order 4 bags at a time; that's what I always do.] <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5I9W">NOW Foods Date Sugar,  16 Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />I ordered this date sugar because I had a recipe for GAPS-legal brownies that called for 2 3/4 c. date sugar. The first time I made the recipe I bought dates and put them in my food processor--I didn't realize you're supposed to dry them in the dehydrator first! So I ended up with a huge sticky ball of very sticky date "sugar" that I used. Some portions of the date got stuck in the sticky, sticky ball of stickiness without totally being blended so I got little chunks of date in my brownies. I had trouble blending the sticky date ball with the butter and cocoa, and it was tough to mix into the rest of the recipe. It wasn't the end of the world, and the brownies were good, but the texture was a little off.<br /><br />SO, I ordered this date sugar and I've made the brownies again. (One package is exactly the amount the recipe calls for.)  Holy smokes, it was so much easier! Instead of buying this date sugar, you COULD buy a bunch of dates, dry them out in a dehydrator, and put them in a food processor. I won't do that again though, because that takes a bunch of time, and it cost me more to use dates from the store than it cost to buy this already turned into date sugar.<br /><br />The texture of this date sugar is uniform enough that it works well in recipes, but the color and size of the granules varies enough that you know it comes from real food instead of being some sort of chemical product. The date sugar is quite sweet, and very easy to work with.<br /><br />I will definitely continue to buy this date sugar.

review/summary: Not as good as it sounds
review/text: I'm not nearly as taken with Orbit's Fruitini gum as I am with some of their other flavors.  Some of their flavors are fantastic, and Orbit gum generally has a nice consistency to chew, but there's something off about this flavor.  I'm pretty sure the culprit is the whitening agents.  Not all Orbit gum claims to whiten, but this is one of the flavors that does, and I think you can taste the whitening agents in the gum.  This gum does taste like fruit, but there's a weird undertone- what I suspect to be the whitening agents.  My advice would be to try a stick before committing to a whole large pack, or go with one of Orbit's other flavors- I recommend the Sangria and the Melon-Mint.

And unlike many snacks, after you eat a handful of them, you feel satiated. With 18 whole grains per serving, I encourage the entire family to snack on these chips often. This is by far the best tasting snack chip on the market. I don't know how they managed to make a chip that takes so good and is so good for you at the same time.

review/text: While the overall quality and flavor of these mandarin oranges seemed just fine, the entire pack of 24 cans I received from Amazon was crushed.  Each and every can was either crushed or dented, which was a pain to open with a can opener.  No doubt, these cans were rejects from grocery stores that Roland is passing off to unsuspecting Amazon customers because the cans were passed over on the shelves.<br /><br />I should have sent the package back, but when I saw that none of the cans were punctured or seemed so damaged that the product quality was compromised, I didn't bother.<br /><br />I like to keep these oranges in my pantry because of my love for a particular summer salad recipe:<br /><br />Mixed green lettuce<br />Diced, peeled green apple<br />Candied walnuts<br />Red onion<br />Mandarin oranges<br />Diced grilled chicken<br />Dried cherries or cranberries<br />Low-fat raspberry vinaigrette<br /><br />It's my favorite salad and when the oranges aren't there, they're definitely missed

review/text: Our cats have been eating Natural Balance for a long time. They like it and it's endorsed by our vet. I started buying it at Amazon recently to save a few cents a can and to have it delivered to my house since the cases of this can get heavy. I buy 6 cases at a time. In both orders I've made,I've had to throw away two or three cans because they are so badly damaged that I believe the seal is broken, so I'm not sure if I'm actually saving any money. In the last shipment, one of my cases was 1 can short and also had a damaged can or two in it so I only got about 21 instead of 24. The first time I ordered, I thought this was a fluke but it happened on this last order also, so shipping damaged goods is just part of their process.

review/summary: Short but Sweet
review/text: These spoons arrived in the mail, unbroken, right in time for a cocktail party I was throwing. They were tasty, on time, and in one piece, but the handle was very short (only about an inch). They are sort of an odd design, all spoon and very little handle, but they work well and would taste good with either sweet or savory fillings.

I really love it....either hot in the microwave or cold with Greek yogurt and fruit.  And, I'm almost through the entire first bag.  If it's something you enjoy, would definitely recommend purchasing it via Amazon in the larger quantity.

The almonds, raisins, date crumbles, walnuts and seeds are fresh and tasty.  A delightful treat.  This will be our "go-to" cereal from here on out.  Thank you Bob's Red Mill and Amazon for carrying it.

review/summary: Move Over Oatmeal!
review/text: As my husband and I get older, we are trying to make healthier choices with what we are eating.  We both love cereals with our breakfast, but let's face it - many cereals out there are over-processed and loaded with sugar and other things.  We like oatmeal, but oatmeal can be a bit boring.  This Muesli from Bob's Red Mill is fabulous!  It has a variety of whole grains in it, plus nuts, sunflower seeds, raisins and dates.  It cooks up easily with boiling water and makes a nice, thick, hearty hot cereal.  It's wonderful 'as is,' but even better with a sprinkle of brown sugar or a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.  We highly recommend Bob's Red Mill Old Country Style Muesli.

review/summary: Muesli doesn't get any better than this.
review/text: For once in my life I am addicted to something that is GOOD for me!  My day doesn't go well if I haven't had a bowl.  In a previous life I was married to a brit who brought back a muesli recipe and habit from living in Germany.  She in turn imported the stuff to central Texas and introduced me to it.  It was not love at first bite.  This stuff is somewhat of an acquired taste.  Back then making the muesli involved planning and long (75+ miles) trips to the nearest organic whole foods store before the ingredients could be assembled.  Then, after a muelsi hiatus of around 12 years and trying the few commercial products I would find and be disappointed with them all, one day I stumbled on the listing in Amazon for the Bob's Red Mill product.  Not expecting too much more than another commercial muesli wanna-be, I ordered a package.  Eureka!  This is the real deal muesli, folks!  It doesn't get any more wholesome than this.<br /><br />How addicted am I?  It's a 2 pack a month habit now (2 of us). I've got this as a scheduled delivery every two months, has been for about 2 years now. I eat it mostly cold with milk, soaking for between 0 to 30 minutes.  Note that different soak times give different textures.  Dried or fresh fruit garnishes a bowl beautifully.  I add no sugar to the cold cereal. And pat myself on the back for being so wholesome.  On the other hand, every now and then I'll do a cooked batch.  The difference between the two is as different as jerky from steak.  Totally different flavor and I find the hot version is begging to be gussied up with dried fruit (cooked in with the cereal), a healthy(!) dollop of butter and brown sugar, even just a wee pinch of salt, and just a little milk to cool and thin the porridge.  What a treat!!<br /><br />I love this stuff.  I don't find that I get tired of the taste, or find it too bland like other reviewers have commented.  My body loves this stuff - two or three days without a bowl and I start noticing the changes.  With all the products out there today for colon cleansing agents and such all I can say is, as long as I have my muesli, I'm good to go. :-)<br /><br />I suspect there are others out there besides me who are habituated to this muesli.

review/summary: more interesting than oatmeal
review/text: I used to eat a lot of oatmeal and sometimes I would eat it cold with water and salt added. This brand of Muesli tastes much better than plain oatmeal without sugar. I use the following recipe:<br /><br />1/3 cup Muesli<br /><br />3 T Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EY5COG">Meyenberg Evaporated Goat Milk, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />1/3 cup water<br /><br />1 T sugar<br /><br />I mix the ingredients with a spoon in a glass jar that has a plastic lid (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141B6LQ">Luminarc Working Glass 21 oz w/Red Lid, Set of 4</a>). I leave it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to 24 hours. I find that it tastes best if it sits for at least 12 hours. As a final note the bags were much smaller than I expected because I considered how large 40 ounces of oatmeal would be but I guess the addition of the dried fruit and nuts adds weight, so the package is slightly less than half of a 40 ounce can of oatmeal.

review/text: I used to eat oatmeal every day.  Then I tried this.  I eat it every day, sometimes twice a day.  It is so much better than oatmeal.  It is a complex mix of grains, with the sweetness of dates and the tartness of cranberries.  It is versatile, I like it mixed with water and microwaved for two minutes, or cold with almond milk, or mixed into yogurt, also can nuke with some banana slices for a heavenly treat! It gives you enough fiber for the day and I never get tired of it.  When I'm craving dessert, but trying to be good, I have a little bowl of Bob's Red Mill Muesli.  (contains NO sugar)<br />Ordering the 4 40 ounce bags saves a ton of money, as it costs much more for much less in the grocery stores.<br />I have it on autodelivery and don't buy any other cereal during the year, saves money, is good for me and tastes great!

review/text: This mixed with lowfat plain yogurt & cinnamon is my mid afternoon snack everyday=sweet, crunchy, yummy tummy filler. I signed up for the automated delivery (extra 15% off) and the cost dropped down almost half of what I used to pay for it. Delivery was incredibly quick, 3 business days after I placed my order! Perfect blend of everything, and my kids love it too.

review/summary: Better toasted
review/text: Prefer it toasted (200 degrees for 30 minutes spread out on a rimmed cookie sheet, half a 40 oz bag at a time) rather than raw.  Toasting brings out the nutty flavors (esp the sunflower seeds) and crisps up the grains, so when the muesli is added to boiling water (1 cup water to 1/2 cup muesli), then microwaved for a further 30 seconds, the texture is just right.  I add a sprinkle of raisins to the boiling water so they are plump by the time the microwaving is done, and the raisins add a soft plump sweetness to the serving (the date bits in the mix are sweet but hard).  Topped with sliced strawberries or other fruit, a few dry roasted nuts (for crunch and more flavor), and milk, and I have the core of a great breakfast.  There are occasional tough fibers or hard seeds in the mix that seem to be inedible, but these probably comprise less than 1 pct of the mix, so they are tolerable in a cereal that has become my standard healthy and  quick breakfast.  The cost per serving compares favorably to Post Great Grains (date and pecan) (the PGG has better crunch), which I similarly appreciate but is usually more expensive.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I love this stuff.  Look, if you would rather have Fruity Pebbles instead of oatmeal, you are not going to be happy with this.  It's a bunch of grains with some seeds and a little fruit.  Compared to most of the mass market boxed cereals, this is like whole wheat bread and those are like chocolate covered eclairs.<br /><br />I'm halfway through my first bag.  The only way I've tried this so far is a bit over a cup of cereal and almost a cup and a half of water.  Then I nuke it for 2 minutes, stir, nuke it for 2 more, stir again and let it sit for about 10 minutes.  Then I add a packet of Splenda and chow down.  I'm also a fan of Grape Nuts and oatmeal.

review/summary: great way to lower your cholesterol
review/text: My husband took this product about 1/2 cup a day for a month.  His cholesterol went down from 230 to 190.  What an amazing food!  His doctor said if he kept doing this, he may be able to stop his medicine.  He has been taking medicines to lower cholesterol for more than 10 years.<br /><br />He kept a bag in his office and soaked a half cup of the product in a mug with a very hot water for about 5 min. and took it as a snack or sometimes as his breakfast.  I think it works better without cooking.  I used to cook him regular oat meal for breakfast for sometimes but didn't see such a progress.

If I miss the soak I microwave it in the mornings.  It needs time to absorb the liquid. It is good tasting all by itself, but I add protein powder (I'm a veggie and need additional protein)or/and blueberries. Les

review/summary: A great winter breakfast
review/text: Bob's Red Mill Muesli has been my winter breakfast standard for years.  I love it, and after my local grocery store stopped carrying it I was glad to find it on amazon.<br /><br />Cooking it requires some care.  There are seeds in it that some people (including myself) find objectionably hard, but if you cook it carefully, with plenty of water, that problem goes away.  My technique for cooking it is to put the muesli in the pot first, then add water, about 50% more water than the instructions call for and then to cook at covered at a very low heat.  I use maple syrup for sweetening. It's delicious!
