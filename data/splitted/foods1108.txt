review/summary: Small Jars and a Little Runny - like most commercial baby foods
review/text: Let me start by saying my 7 month old son, who is used to my home prepared baby foods LOVES this, as a once in a blue moon convenience meal! I've tried it and it tastes pretty good to me too. Rare in the baby food industry.<br /><br />I am following a weaning guide that I used for my daughter, and it makes you pretty wary of commercial baby foods as babies easily get used to the bland, watery taste and sometimes take a lot of coaxing to go back to home made, healthy meals, resulting in picky toddlers and children. My daughter is now 3 and has never refused a home cooked meal yet, and I attribute that to the hard work I put in in the first year. Another problem with commercial baby foods is that they are usually so padded out with water that nutritional needs aren't fully met during the day and babies can start waking in the night due to genuine hunger.<br /><br />I'd love to ask, who came up with the magical 4oz measurement for all stage 2 baby food jars and packets, though? My son takes more like 6oz of my home prepared meals which are much "fuller", so I've had to add a little sweet potato to this to increase the volume. And it does seem really quite runny and padded out with water, so I add a teaspoon or 2 of rice cereal to thicken it up a little. Before long, I'm sure he'll just be on 2 full 4oz jars when I give him this.<br /><br />All that said, I'll reiterate, it is really quite tasty for a commercial baby food, and I have no problem giving it to my son once in a while. I do recommend!

review/summary: Twice the protein of other Earth's best and baby food in general
review/text: The Earth's best 'grourmet' line is heavy on the protein. And as far as I know adequate protein is important for babies and they need, like the rest of us, good iron levels.<br /><br />The beef and spinach contains 5 grams per serving. You can check your cans, but most of the other's we use the protein is 2 grams. Our daughter likes it. It is also the least expensive of the 'gourmet' line and this is not something I could find in local stores. Recommended.

review/summary: Not a fan unfortunately.
review/text: I was looking for another dinner to try and decided to spend the extra money on this one.  I thought.. my son loves chicken and mangos so why not this. He is not a fan. He will suffer through half a jar, but will not finish a whole one. I guess it was a little too exotic for his 9 month old taste buds.  We will keep trying.<br /><br />He loves, loves, loves the beef and spinach and will almost cry when the jar is gone.

review/summary: BITTER, and mainly carrots.
review/text: This was NOT a hit!  It's bitter, like maybe the carrots were not sweet and/or not peeled?  and the main ingredient is carrots! (amazon should include the ingredients for all items) Quality control seems to be an issue. This is the second "gourmet meal" flavor with this issue. I had never had a bad experience with the EB products before, very disappointing.

review/summary: MESSY, MESSY, MESSY
review/text: My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking.

review/text: My 9 mo. old daughter only eats earth's best products and loves all of them - that is, except this. I can't figure out what it is, but we finally concluded that it smells a little like catfood. I tried feeding her this mango chicken flavor a few different times and she would only eat a few bites. I gave up and donated the rest to the food bank hoping someone else's child would like it. I have had a good experience with the "subscribe and save" products in general, no broken jars and the quick delivery is great. I find that it is cheaper than whole foods (even with the coupons). This is the only flavor of earth's best baby food that my daughter dislikes. For what it's worth, I suggest skipping this one or trying it in a variety pack first.

review/summary: Some broken jars
review/text: When I saw some of the Earth's Best jars offered as a Gold Box deal, I remembered that I needed to offer a caveat to other parents.<br />  My children have previously enjoyed many Earth's Best flavors, which in general taste quite good, so in February when there was a promotional offer through Amazon, we ordered two 12-packs. When they arrived, one of the 12-packs seemed ok, but the other 12-pack contained several broken jars and was leaking. It smelled and looked like there might be mold under the plastic that surrounded the second 12-pack.<br />  I noticed that the shipping box holding the two 12-packs had air-filled padding on only the top side of the box, which meant that there was no padding protecting the bottom side.<br />  I don't know whether some of the jars had broken at the warehouse or during delivery, but either way, I was afraid to use the unbroken jars too, because what if the seals had broken or what if there were small pieces of broken glass inside the intact jars too?<br />For more durable items, I still order from Amazon, but I canceled my subscription of the Earth's Best jars and from now on will buy jars at a physical store where I can check them first.

Jasmine is a pleasant addition and the Good Earth is one of the best jasmine green teas I have tried.  Been buying it on Amazon for a few years now, on a subscription.  It shows up just when I'm running out, so is very convenient as well as a great price.

review/text: The slogan is there for a reason. As an American, I had never sampled Marmite (or Vegemite, for that matter) until about a month ago. On vacation in Ireland, I was determined to try the famous divider of palates: once and for all. I was certainly divided by it, but into its supporters! Umami taste mixed with a heavy dose of salt, texture like a smooth syrup--slightly thicker. Slight bitter taste that offsets the rest. Many people have tried to describe it, but one must try it for themselves to truly understand it.<br /><br />After returning to the states, I've been unable to find it in any local grocery store, international or otherwise. Amazon has a fair price on it, and the legendary customer service more than makes up for my inability to find a local source.

Definately recommend that you try a sample first: it is an acquired taste for adults!  I love it and always have done: it has a strong 'meaty' and salty (only 8%) flavor that I love to spread on toast (GF, of course) and butter.  Also great to add to a stew as it brings a deep flavor to the palate: works brilliantly on either red meat or chicken thighs (not too sure why it does not work with white breast meat, it just doesn't).

review/summary: Savory and salty spread; great for cooking and stirring in soups and gravies, too. 4 stars rating on price and delivery
review/text: Guys:<br />Marmite is what it is.  This is a difficult product to rate on its own merits because this is something that you'll either love or hate and if you're looking at this, you probably have already tasted this.  If you never had this before, the best description I can give this is that it tastes like a beef bouillon cube dissolved in a thick, paste-y gelatin like paste......almost like a thick. clear model-airplane glue that comes in the tube, like Duco cement (sounds yummy, right)?  I actually love this on toast, plain or with butter. I've also stirred it into gravy, soups and even coated a Thanksgiving turkey with it before roasting in the oven (just lift up the skin and smear this all over the meat, then place the skin back on and smear a little bit more on the skin; then roast regularly).<br />The price for one of these tiny jars in NYC is close to $6, so at $4 a pop delivered to your door using subscribe and save, this is a decent bargain.<br />Regarding some of the comments about expiration dates...honestly, I don't think this stuff EVER expires. It has way too much salt in it to go bad (in my opinion).  As an aside, I had an open jar in my cabinet that I noticed had an "expiration date" of 2002 (it's now 2012) and it still tastes GREAT....in fact, I think it even tastes better than when I first opened it in 2000 (lol)

review/text: I bought this because of the reviews that its salty and savory.  I tried it spread on bread with some butter as that seems the traditional route ... wow was that a bad idea.  It's not horrible, just the flavor is so strong as to be over powering.  But it gave the strong impression of hoisin/oyster sauce, two sauces I love but would never spread on toast.  So I just tried some mixed in with some ground beef the way I would use those two, a little goes a long way.  Worked great, the flavor mixed well and added a nice background flavor to the beef. So it definitely has a place in my life, just not with butter and toast, those two are fine on their own.

review/summary: I love Marmite but its an acquired taste.
review/text: Really you have to be brought up on Marmite from a baby to really like it. I'm from England so I've had it on toast with butter all my life.  If you want something a little milder try the Australian version called Vegemite.  That's good as well.

review/summary: MSG nightmare, be warned, concentrated free glutamates
review/text: I bought this item and last weekend ate quite a lot of it.<br />The savory taste is appealing, yet I have had to educate myself on safe ways to enjoy that taste.<br />Little did I know that my food sensitivity issues would peak shortly after.<br />It began with searing pains in my shoulder, arm and neck. Then a supercell migraine and seizure.<br />It was the most painfully harrowing ordeal of my entire 65 year life.<br />For the first time in my life I was wailing and whimpering uncontrollably, as if tortured.<br />My wife got me to the ER where they gave me IV morphine, then benedryl, then more morphine, then more benedryl.<br />After an hour of blow torch pain, with emergency medical intervention,  it started to pass.<br />I am deeply humbled to more careful choices in the future.<br /><br />This product has a cute bottle, quaint ad campaign, and interesting history.<br />However the slogan: "love it or hate it" is not just about taste.<br /><br />If you have an MSG (monosodium glutamate), or any free glutamate sensitivity, stay far away from this stuff.<br />All processed yeast products and many fermented food items, extracts, additives, concentrate free glutamate.<br /><br />Free glutamates function as a neurotoxin and we each have a different threshold of sensitivity.<br />Phantom neck, shoulder or arm pains are the beginning of noticing where your threshold is.<br />Long time, or early life overdose is linked to symptoms of asthma, migraine, autism, ADHD, ALS, MS, fibromyalgia, Alzheimer's, to name few.<br /><br />Please save your self if you are sensitive to these chemicals.<br />Educate your self through the web info resources on what to watch for (so much it is in), learn to read and decode food labels, etc.<br /><br />This may not ever surface as an issue for you.<br /><br />All others, please enjoy.<br />Word to the wise.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br />WV

review/summary: Peanut Butter Pretzels - Tasty and Alliterative Too
review/text: Who'd've thought (notice the double contraction!) that peanut butter pretzels could taste so good?  Yes, one serving of 9 sandwiches contains 7g of fat (but no trans fats) and 140 calories, though few could possibly stop at just one serving.<br />Despite the dietary red flags, I've got to give these pretzel sandwiches five stars, just because they taste so good.<br /><br />On the positive side the first ingredient is not ordinary wheat flour, but unbleached wheat flour. Less processing with the unbleached. The peanut butter inside the pretzels is just sweet enough and moist enough to be delightful.<br />If one keeps his or her appetite in check, these can be quite the enjoyable and special snack.<br /><br />Warning: This product does contain peanut products and is processed on equipment that makes dairy products.

review/summary: Chocolate, PB and Pretzels, Oh My!
review/text: A friend saw these on a late-night food show, did some investigating and ordered a box.  She and her husband hid some of the bags so they didn't eat them all at once.  Her enthusiasm convinced me to order a box.  Upon arrival, we opened a bag.  Let's just say chocolate, peanut butter and pretzels never tasted so yummy.  I knew we couldn't keep all those bags in the house so I tucked one in several Christmas gifts.  It was the first thing mentioned in the thank you notes!  Some even asked for a "refill."  I'll be ordering again next year.

review/text: These tomatoes sounded great because they have no additives or preservatives. They were delivered very quickly, and are a dull brown color, which I expected because of the lack of sulfites.  Unfortunately, they are extremely bitter, and even though I expected the flavor to improve when I rehydrated them with water, they retained the bitterness. I tried soaking them in olive oil as well, and this also did not do much to improve the flavor.  Amazon advertises these as sun dried but in fact, they are not sun dried and are air dried instead.  I don't know if that has anything to do with the flavor, and I was unable to find out any other information about the company, Sonoma. Therefore, I would not recommend these tomatoes. :(

review/text: This Donut House Blend is a light roast coffee. It is not bitter & has a mild flavor.  I brew this in an 8oz cup & find it in the "not too light, but not bold" category.  It works well with a splash of milk.<br /><br />I would categorize this blend in the breakfast coffee category - coffee that you sip during breakfast that will not compete with your food for flavor.  It also works well as an afternoon "pick me up" coffee.<br /><br />If you are looking for a mild blend with no bitterness, check out this blend.

For me it was to strong for my first cup of black coffee in the morning. I will admit I love this coffee in the evening with some Bailey's Irish Creme in it.

review/summary: Donut House Coffee Review
review/text: Not thrilled with this coffee unfortunately. I chose extra bold for a reason, and this coffee is definitely not an extra bold coffee. I was really kinda bummed when we tasted the coffee. I'm not even sure I can say I taste "MUCH" of a "coffee" flavor really at all.<br /><br />Bummed out in New Gloucester, Maine

review/summary: Weak - get Emeril's Big Easy Bold!
review/text: On the middle or 'mug' setting of the Keurig B-70, Donut House didn't hold a candle to Emeril's Big Easy Bold k-cup.  Emeril's is superior - truly robust, full and velvety without any hint of a burned, smokey or earthy taste whatsoever, but has a terrific depth and complexity.  Donut House falls short of being an 'extra bold' coffee and is more a medium bodied blend.

review/summary: Did I get a bad batch?
review/text: Donut Shop is one of my favorites. Though it is also the blend I get the most failures with. So I decided to pick up a box of this Donut House flavor at my local Bed Bath & Beyond. To me it is awful! No flavor at all and hardly any color. I normally buy bold flavors/variants and pump the 10oz mug size. I had to lower this one to 8oz to not totally wash it out. I was very hopeful but just forcing my way through the batch. I'm hoping, because of the other reviews that I got a bad batch. So take my review with a grain of salt but I've been using K-Cups for years.

review/text: When I got my Keurig I had heard from friends that the Donut coffee was one of the best.  I hadn't realized that some of them were referring to Dunkin' Donuts coffee, others were referring to Donut SHOP coffee and others were referring to this, Donut HOUSE, coffee.  They're all different.<br /><br />This has a smooth/mild flavor.  The coffee taste isn't strong (on either 10oz or 8oz settings, the flavor just gets more "intense") and it's actually kind of nice for a later evening cup of coffee.  But, of the 3 Donut brands, I prefer it the least.

review/summary: Great Bold Smooth Kup of Coffee
review/text: This is Green Mountain's response to the Coffee People's Donut Shop coffee.  Many people actually confuse the two which isn't difficult to do: donut house and donut shop -- both are extra bold in flavor, and both are excellent.  Since Donut Shop is my favorite, I decided to conduct a taste test between these two rivals.  Side to side they are very similar, very little acid taste, no bitterness which is what I look for in an extra bold roast.  Head to head Donut Shop edged this coffee, Donut House, out by the slightest of margin.  Donut Shop had slightly more body to it but frankly, it took me drinking a half cup of each before I could declare a winner.  This is why I also think this is a 5 star coffee -- excellent choice if you want a simple, great tasting cup of coffee that you will not get sick of.

review/summary: Very Light
review/text: I decided to try a box because Costco carries this and they haven't had my favorite Tully's Kona for a while. It lives up to the "light roast" description and brews one of the lightest (you might also say 'weakest') cups of coffee I've had in any K-cup. Even using two k-cups didn't help much. It's way too light for my tastes; glad I didn't buy the box of 88 at Costco.<br /><br />So, if you like a lightly roasted and somewhat weak cup of coffee, you'd like this. The flavor is good. But, k-cups run a little on the weak side in general and this one is simply too light for me.<br /><br />Amazon did ship fast and had a good price.<br /><br />UPDATE: Some reviews here don't seem to understand the terms being used.<br /><br />"Light Roast" is a description of how long the coffee beans are roasted. Light roaster beans do not have the strong and sometimes bitter flavor of beans that are roasted for longer times, but they retain more of the subtleties of their flavor.  It does produce a `lighter' cup of coffee.<br /><br />"Extra Bold" is a term Keurig/Green Mountain uses to describe a K-cup that has more coffee grounds in it than normal K-cups.  More coffee grounds makes for a stronger cup of coffee. The strength of the coffee also depends on how large a cup you brew.<br /><br />You can have a "light roast" coffee in an "Extra Bold" K-cup, but the result will still be a coffee with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />Personally, I like a medium roast; a nice balance between good coffee flavor and that strong coffee bite.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I get my K-cups either at Amazon (used to be the cheapest) or Costco (is the cheapest). The obvious problem with Costco is the selection, maybe 2 or 3 kinds to choose from. That is why I still buy from amazon occasionally, real nice selection to choose from.  I have had my Keurig for about a year and have tried many different kinds of coffee from most of the companies out there. I found the coffee shop brand at Costco and this has become one of my favorites and was my daily cup. If you have ever shopped at Costco you know that things come and go a lot. That was the case with my donut shop yesterday. IT WAS GONE!! Replaced with donut "house". I figured for .42 a cup I would give it a try. I am not disappointed at all. It is just as good as the donut shop I used to drink. Perhaps ever so slightly less strong, but an excellent cup of coffee, and cant beat the price at Costco. The only thing that is a little confusing on Amazon is the price?? That is really high. Anyway. If you are a donut shop drinker you will love the donut house every bit as much. Don't hesitate to buy it...but make sure you check the price. Great price available form Costco....this week

review/summary: Drinkable, but rather bland, not full-bodied, will not buy again
review/text: I have been a Keurig user for several years, have one at home and one in my office. For at least 4 years I have been using the Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups, been very happy with them. Recently I saw the Donut House flavor offered at my local warehouse club and it piqued my interest, problem is that the warehouse box contains 80 K-cups, didn't want to buy 80 of something I may not like. So, I picked up an 18-count box at my local Walmart, I'm so glad that I did!<br /><br />First, let me say that I'm not a fan of Starbucks coffee's, I think they are too strong, too bold, too bitter. I like a flavorful, medium roast but full-bodied cup of coffee. The Green Mountain Columbian Fair Trade K-cups fit this bill, whenever I would make a cup at my office, everyone would comment, "Wow, that smells so good!", it tasted just as good.<br /><br />I tried the Donut House coffee this morning, no inviting aroma when brewing, very bland in taste, I don't know how they get away with calling this "Bold". It says right on the box, "light roast", I don't know how a "light roast" can be called "Bold"? I was expecting a very full-bodied flavor, but without a bitter after-taste. Well, there was no after-taste, no taste period, just very bland!<br /><br />FYI, I usually use 16 oz. "to go" cups when brewing K-cups, I use 2 K-cups per 16 oz. cup, I brew the first K-cup on the middle button (8 oz. setting), the the second K-cup on the lowest setting (I think it is 6.5 oz. setting), this allows room for a teaspoon of sugar and some half and half to a golden color. I have been doing this for years with my Columbian K-cups and always get a great cup of coffee, did the same with the Donut House blend, drinkable, but not remarkable in any way. I will be sticking with my Columbian Fair Trade blend that never fails me.<br /><br />I will use the remainder of my Donut House K-cups, but I will not buy them again.

review/summary: Pretty delish!
review/text: I'm a big fan of Keurig cups, so I ended up picking a box of this up at Sam's Club the other day to bring to work. (If you have a membership already, this is cheaper there. If not, then this is probably the better deal unless you absolutely want a membership to those types of stores.) It was worth the purchase, in my opinion.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this was pretty nice. I was a little worried about whether or not the cup would be too watery due to the type of machine we use at work (it has a water reservoir that it draws from rather than the one I have at home, where you add your own water), but this brewed up nicely. It was a little mild tasting, so if you're more partial to teas since coffee tastes too harsh then this will be a good alternative. If you're the type that likes the darker roasts, then you'll want to skip this one. (Although be aware that the lighter the roast, the more caffeine the bean has! The darker it is, the longer it's roasted and the more caffeine is roasted out!)<br /><br />I'm fairly happy with this product and I'm pretty psyched that you get so many per box. The smaller boxes are good for individual use, but for larger crowds? You have to buy in bulk just to save money, otherwise you'll go broke.

review/text: This is by far the best decaf I've ever tasted.  It's better than most regular coffee.  But, the picture included here indicates "Extra Bold" and the K-cups I received are Light Roast.  In truth I don't think that Donut House makes an "Extra Bold" decaf.  I would recommend this coffee, but I wouldn't call it "extra bold".  Bold compared to other decafs maybe!
