review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I'm in the Midwest.  I've been drooling over pictures of thesee lobster rolls on the internet for months now.  I broke down one day and bought them.  I've never had a lobster roll.  In fact I didn't even know that it wasn't a hot sandwich until I read the instructions.  With shipping this came out to $117 so that's $20 per sandwich.  That's a little more than your Subway sandwich.  I got these shipped over night.  You get a box with insulation and ice packs inside.  They lobster salad comes chilled, not frozen.  I pulled out the plastic container holding the lobster.  It was about a pint I guess.  I set it on the counter along with the 6 rolls.  My fist impression was wow I paid $117 for this?  It didn't look like much at all.  I open the container with the lobster salad.  Visually I was awed.  Wow, look at all these huge chunks of lobster meat!  I took a sniff.  It didn't smell like anything which means it is fresh I guess but I was expecting lobster smell.  Also it seemed more like lobster meat than lobster salad because there was nothing in it.  I read the instructions and it said I could add more mayo which I did.  I can't complain about the vendor or the delivery but I can't say I was that impressed with the taste of the lobster roll itself.  It was bland.  Beats me.  I'm no expert.  There are a bunch of good reviews so maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.  When I get lobsters I savor it by chewing really slowly and I have that lobster taste in my mouth for a while after eating it.  Didn't get that.  Over the next couple days I finished the rest of the lobster meat but with less enthusiasm.  Don't' get me wrong they were pretty good but I found myself wanting to eat something else however I didn't want to waste $117.  The last one I heated the meat and added tarragon.  It was ok.  There you go.  That was my once in a lifetime lobster roll experience.  Not really for me.  I'll stick with live lobster.  Actually if I ever wanted lobster rolls again I'd just buy live lobster locally and make it myself.  the only reason I order off the internet was to get the authentic rolls.  Woopidy doo.  Seriously it was just white bread.

review/summary: Amazing, delicious, perfect!
review/text: These were incredible. The lobster was unbelievable fresh, and the rolls were exactly right, especially brushed with butter and lightly grilled. There was ample lobster salad for six rolls, and while we added a bit of celery, it was equally delicious without. We're already planning our next order.

review/summary: Lots of lobster very little mayo :)
review/text: I enjoyed this product very much I ended up eating everything in one day by myself nom nom nom...<br /><br />The lobster was plentiful, a ton is given, very chunky pieces of the claw and what not. There is just very little mayo, just enough to hold the lobster together. The rolls were tasty, as instructed apply a little butter in the insides and warm it on a skillet and apply the generous amount of lobster and bon appetit!<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Will look to purchase again one day in the near future! :)

There is so much gorgeous lobster meat in these!  There is barely any mayo and nothing else, just fresh lobster!  They arrived right when I had requested and packed properly.  I can see us doing this again soon!

review/summary: Just Like Home...
review/text: Being born and bred in Southeastern Connecticut, I know lobster. Since being transferred to Southern Georgia with the Navy, I've really been missing New England seafood this last year. I've been to Hancock's website many times, but was always turned off by the very expensive shipping. When I saw the deal they had here on Amazon with free shipping, I immediately placed my order!<br /><br />I received my Lobster rolls yesterday (about 2 days after ordering) and have already gone through three...they are SOOOO good! When I saw the container of lobster meat I wasn't sure there was gonna be enough for 6 rolls, but there's plenty. They've done an excellent job with the mixture, they don't ruin it by putting in too much mayo like I've seen others do.<br /><br />If you're at all interested, I definitely say go for it. Yes, it's a bit on the pricey side, but well worth it. I just CANNOT find decent lobster here in the south, so Hancock will be my supplier for as long as we're stationed anywhere outside the Northeast. My next purchase...the Lobster Mac n Cheese. I have very high hopes for it!

review/summary: My first Lobster Roll
review/text: This was my first time eating a Lobster Roll. I was very happy about this product. The rolls were a real treat also and complimented the lobster meat that was sweet and very fresh tasting. I added just a few drops of Key Lime juice on the Lobster Meat. I  also had speedy service. I ordered this product Wed and received this on Friday of the same week which was well before the estimated arrival date(I live in South GA). Thank you Hancock Company and Thank you Amazon again for having such a wonderful place to order products.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CDAY2">Downeast Lobster Rolls</a>

The salad was superb... giant chunks of tender, flavorful Maine lobster... only a little mayo (don't want to smother the lobster!). This is a terrific product.

review/text: I got these as a gift for Christmas cause I had them in my wish list, I was disappointed in them, they had lots of lobster which cant be bad in anything, but were dry as in mayonaise wise. Everything was fresh when it arrived, but just not as I remember as in my days of living in New England and having this sandwich at Points East in Westfield Mass!! Just my opinion, you just might like them, but Id add more mayo and maybe celery..just missing something!!

review/summary: Package wasn't received, and both UPS and Amazon said it was the other's problem
review/text: I have given my dogs these dental treats before and they are very popular with them. The package I found on Amazon was a good price for the large quantity ordered. Since now I have paid the money and never received the item, and basically have found no direct route of getting refunded, I am not happy. I will be reluctant to purchase from Amazon again because there was no way for me to get hold of them for a reimbursement. I contacted UPS and they said Amazon likes to handle these things directly. And from looking all through Amazon's website, it says to contact UPS directly. And when I try to put in for a refund, the product not arriving is never an option---and there is no phone number or way to email otherwise. I guess I am out $30 for this purchase. I am disappointed in both Amazon and UPS for their service. I think if the product arrived, I would have likely been happy with it.

review/text: Mochi were delivered in an acceptable state - quite soft and fresh, but deformed and squashed. As for the taste - well, they were OK with tea, but I could still taste the artificial ingredients quite distinctly, especially in the pink variety (presumably peach).. All in all, they are inferior to other mochi I have tried, though not too bad.

review/text: I'd already tried a couple of other varieties of this line and had liked them, so I expected to like this flavor as well, However, this tea has an unpleasant flowery aftertaste that makes it feel as though I'm drinking perfume. After a sip of this flavor, I feel like I need something else to drink because something about it just leaves me feeling thirstier than before.<br /><br />Maybe it's a taste some people enjoy, but it's not one I will be buying again.

review/summary: Love Love Love the Berries of Summer, Stop Me Before I Start Raving
review/text: Lipton to Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, blackberry pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting sweet tea that registers only five calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product comes in a small box, in which are ten handy flutes, each of which is good for either two eight ounce servings or one sixteen ounce drink: it's also available as an economical flat.  It is, the manufacturer states, made from real tea leaves and contains 60 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce serving.  It is also sweetened with honey, and real fruit flavors.  It is, as well, easy to prepare.  You can add a packet to one bottle (16.9 fl. oz. of water), or to a glass of water: just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  It's obviously a handy thing to keep on hand for the office, the gym, the backpack, or anywhere you are on the go.  The caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love love love the berries of summer, all of them, and though blueberries have now been called very healthy, I always loved them, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, gooseberries when I can find them, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy, too.  However, in the list of ingredients I find sucralose and corn maltodextrin as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me. I'm not a dietitian, just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.

review/summary: changed for the worse
review/text: Until last year the 1928 flavor was very dry and authentic.  Extremely retro flavored and reminiscent of the kind of neat dry tasting bubble gum packed in baseball cards of the 50s.  The 1928 flavor was something special and reminded you of your youth the instant you bit into it.  Completely unlike any modern sugary gum.<br /><br />Then last year they decided to make it more palatable to the modern taste.  It is not awful but a lot of the dry "gotta have it" flavor has been swapped for a gooey sort of modern sweeter type gum.  Now it is more sugary and bland at the same time.  You might like it if you like Disco music.<br /><br />In short...it sucks compared to what they were making last year.  All the retro has disappeared.<br /><br />Way to go Dubble Bubble.  I will now add you to Black Jack, Beemans and Clove as flavors that have decided to weaken your brand flavor in search of a wider audience.  Guess what?  Us lovers of the original are not fooled and we say---"See Ya!"  I will never again buy your gum.  And good luck trying to convince modern tastes that you have anything cool to offer.  You are the worst kind of sell outs.  The kind that die with a whimper...

review/summary: Best gum EVER!!  But bargain shop for a better price
review/text: This is the BEST gum ever, I LOVED it as a kid.  I've tried buying it over the years, but the kind that is most commonly sold (the "original flavor") is NOT the REAL original flavor (the fake "original flavor" comes in a yellow twist wrapper & can be found everywhere).  THIS 1928 version is the REAL, original flavor I remember as a child growing up in the 60s, 70s and 80s (and beyond, until they changed the recipe to the gross version that you find most places).  The 1928 "original flavor" is the one I remember - the sweet cinnamon/clove flavor (but not the of cinnamon that burns your mouth like Red Hots or Big Red gum).  It's not easy to find, but I found it at our local Cracker Barrel then came here to Amazon to see if I could buy it in bulk.  I was thrilled to find it, but not at this price, no way!  Thankfully, I found a much better deal from a different vendor so make sure you check it out and don't get price gauged.  This gum is great, you want to be able to actually ENJOY it while you chew it (and have enough $$ left over to pay for the dental bills). ;)

review/text: I've been buying Nature's Path gluten free foods for a number of years, and have been fully satisfied.  I've had access to somewhat lower prices than what traditional grocery stores put on their products, but am delighted that Amazon's price is virtually identical to the prices offered by the discount organic foods market we've purchased these from in the past.  I doubt you'll find Nature's Path products any lower anywhere else, particularly when you consider no sales tax and free shipping if the order is large enough.  Also, I contacted Nature's Path once with a question about one of their products (the Mesa Sunrise flakes).  Customer service is excellent and very friendly (much nicer than we typically get "down here" in the States - they're a Canadian company up in B.C.).  If this sounds like a commercial, it's not intended to be - I just have been entirely satisfied with Nature's Path foods for years and have no complaints at all.  When a company does a good job, they deserve referrals - everybody wins.

We eat it with organic milk, organic blueberries & bananas, and it really helps us start the day with the energy we need. The large pack helps the cereal last longer than the smaller packs, which rarely last beyond a couple of days. We love this cereal, and we think it's really a bargain! We also love the free shipping, which we found to be very prompt more often than not. Thanks, Amazon!

review/summary: Not Gluten Free! Chance of Cross Contamination Because Made on Same Equipment as Gluten!
review/text: My daughter who has Celiac had a severe reaction after eating this and the Mesa Sunrise Cereal also by Nature's Path for several days. This was the only new food in her diet so I checked the website of Nature's Path for more information. it turns out they make their GF cereals on the same equipment as the gluten ones. They promise they wash the equipment and throw away the first part of the cereal made yet there was still enough there for my daughter to react. I would never have bought this cereal if I knew that it was made in the same room much less the same equipment. Some companies are ethical and will admit when their food is processed in the same area or on the same equipment so people like my daughter have a choice of whether to risk their health or not.

review/summary: Best corn flakes ever!
review/text: These corn flakes are truly the best I've ever eaten.  They are crispy, stay that way for quite some time when served in milk, and are deeply satisfying insofar as flavor is concerned.  To boot, and very important to me, they are gluten free.  With some products, looking at the price-tag is a waste of time, I'd buy these anywhere, at any price.

review/text: This product is worth buying. I am sensitive to the smallest quantity of gluten and certainly DO NOT react to this product. As other reviews mention, it tastes great and has a nice crunch. I have also found that unlike other gluten free cornflakes, the texture in this one is consistent - I don't get any hard gritty pieces. Great with sliced up banana.

They have a lot more wholesome flavor.  Much like comparing other organic products to non-organic, you can't lose with these.  This price makes them even more desirable.

It's very convenient to order them in this six pack - plus the shipping is free since six of the bags costs more than $25 (threshhold above which shipping is free). I wish the price were more consistently lower -the first time I ordered these, the price was less. But it doesn't cost any more than if I bought them locally and I don't have to pay for the gas to drive to the store!

review/text: I just bought these today because I wanted corn flakes that were organic and had a short ingredient list without "natural flavors" or other extras.  These seemed to be the best option.<br /><br />I was surprised by how tasty these are: after I had one bowl, I wanted more!  The flakes are thick enough that they don't get soggy right away, so I liked that they stayed crunchy long enough for me to enjoy them.  The flavor is excellent.  I haven't had other corn flakes for at least a few years, since we started being more careful about what we eat, but these tasted like what I was expecting when I bought them.  They're not a sugary cereal, but they are just lightly sweetened.<br /><br />Now that we've discovered these, we will continue to buy them.

review/text: These cornflakes are tasty, but I cannot eat them without having a negative reaction. Reading through the reviews on this product, I notice I am not the only one to experience this problem. Is it gluten? Or some other ingredient? I cannot say, but I do know there is a problem with "gluten-free" products actually being contaminated with gluten. To be absolutely safe, your gluten-free products should be certified as such.

review/summary: Best Corn Flakes Ever
review/text: I'm not one to make big claims but I honestly think I'm hooked for life. I hate companies feeding children all types of sugars in the name of cereal. Some people equate sweet with tasty; I don't. I've been using corn flakes from Trader Joes, which are good; they've been out for some time, so I had to look for alternatives and I discovered these. Now its bye bye Trader Joes, hello Nature's Path. This food is simple and delicious; everyone loved it. Warm milk, a little honey, and these corn flakes; simply irresistible. Or just plain munch for snack, instead of cookies, etc. Next, I'll be trying their oatmeal.

review/text: Found this cereal quite some time ago & have never changed. We try to eat organically as much as possible & buying small boxes of cereal is just not economical for our large, hungry family. The fact that we can buy this by the case & get FREE shipping is a bonus. We try to stay away from sugar as much as possible & as none of us have a very sweet tooth this cereal is just right. It is sweetened with fruit juice & is not too sweet - you can actually taste the corn. All we add is milk. The bags are large compared to regular cereal boxes & we know our kids are getting a healthy start to the day.

I tried regular sugar, but they didn't taste as good.  these are good, and they last a long time in the bag, so no worries about buying multiple bags.

review/text: MY cat wakes my up at 6 am for his tiki cat.  He absolutely refuse to eat any other wet food and since it is all natural I do not feel bad for giving to him.  You can actually see the prawns in the food.  Anyone who feeds wet food to there cat should try, you can see the chunks of seafood.  I use it to supplement their dry food.  I cannot say enough good thins about the product.

review/summary: They love it...!
review/text: You asked me to review the Tiki cat canned cat food that I purchased. I can present the following description as evidence that it is very well received by my very finicky cats. My purebred Manx cats are served a canned treat each evening that they look forward to very much. In fact, if it is late, they get very demanding and will remind me by very overt actions that "excuse us...but...dinner has not been served at it's usual time!". I divide three different cans of food each evening so that they have three different types/flavors of food on their plate. When I put the food down in front of them, the same thing happens every night. They will sniff all three choices and then eat the one that they like the best first. Each time that I serve the Tiki cat canned food as one of the choices it is the first food that they consume and not one bite of it is ever left over. Additionally, as far as my objective observations go, I find that the quality of the food is very good. I certainly plan to purchase more of this product in the future and I will purchase it from Amazon as that is where I found the best prices.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't taste great. It's not gross, but it's not yummy either! :) I will continue to drink  it!

review/summary: It is a good beef soup if you know a trick
review/text: Actually, this is a very good beef soup if you know a strick how to pour the soup out. Before using this soup, you should let container stand for at least few hours to keep all sweet powder and cinnamon staying in the bottom of the container, then when you are ready to enjoy the soup, you pour soup out gently and slowly in the pot. By doing this way, you will get only clear soup and all the sweet and cinnamon power staying in the bottom of the container, but you have to feel when you should stop pour out the soup. When I feel the container is very light, about only 1/10 of the liquid in the container and I stop. By doing this way, the soup is not sweet and not taste like cinnamon anymore, since then I love this soup because I don't feel thirsty after eating this Beef Pho soup. This Pho soup became my favorite because I can enjoy at home anytime and add extra thing I like as good beef, fresh slice of ginger.<br /><br />The first time, I tried this Pho soup, I didn't like it because it was so sweet as other reviewer wrote. You should try my trick and I am sure you will love this soup again.

review/summary: THe ABSOLUTE MOST DISGUSTING SOUP!!!!!
review/text: This is NOT worth the money I spent on this. It was disgusting. I grew up eating Vietnamese food and let me tell you this does not even come close. IT was way to sweet and had way too much cinnamon in it, not to mention it had a terrible after taste to it. I had to brush my teeth to get the filmy awful after taste out. Yes I understand that this came in a paper container so my expectations were not to high..... but good God even the dog wouldn't eat the soup. That has to tell you something. My Advise... Stay away.. stay far far away from this soup. Back to the drawing board for Pacific cause you guys epically failed on this one!!"

review/summary: Extremely Disappointing
review/text: One star is too much. I am a beef pho addict and am currently restricted to clear and full liquids. I had grown tired of chicken and beef broth, so I was somewhat thrilled when my husband spotted this product on our grocer's shelf. I had a feeling that it would not be as good as what I am accustomed to from my favorite Vietnamese restaurants, but in the interest of variety I gave it a try. It's dreadful. It's just wrong.

review/summary: This stuff is nowhere near real pho.. terrible
review/text: Pho is one of my favorite comfort foods. I make my own pho broth by gallons using a great recipe and freeze it so I can make pho when I feel yucky. I was excited when I found this in the Supermarket, particularly when I saw no MSG in the ingredients. I do use their other broths quite a lot so I am familiar with their products and am usually satisfied.<br /><br />Part of the reason I make my own is to avoid MSG and other items but lack of MSG aside this stuff is terrible. It's bland and by shortcutting by using spice extracts and lime oil it just doesn't taste good. Plus by having lemon juice and lime oil in up-front it ends up with that 'cooked citrus' taste by the time its heated for use. This product would be improved by leaps and bounds just by eliminating the lemon juice and lime oil - lime is added at serving anyway. The broth also needs to be infused with the roasted spices, not just tweaked with extracts, IMHO. Plus by eliminating sea salt and using small amounts of good quality fish sauce there would be a far more rounded and balanced flavor. All in all I think if I need a quick pho fix I will need to look elsewhere. Pity.

review/text: I brought 20 packets of this over from New Zealand because I was simply stunned at how authentic this curry paste was, and I did not think I would find it in the US. But here it is on Amazon! I have ZERO hesitation in recommending this brand of Asian spices. They are as authentic as I have ever come across. It tastes exactly like restaurant food. Actually, better than some restaurants. Even the price is better than NZ. Oh I am so happy tonight. I was saving these packets for special occasions, and now I can just go nuts :)

review/text: While living in Singapore I became aquainted with these seasonings packets.  They are simply wonderful.  The Butter Chicken is my favorite.  I have ordered them directly from Asian Home Gourmet because I could not find the Butter Chicken anywhere. Now to find them here on Amazon makes me so happy!<br /><br />To the uninitiated in Asian food, Butter Chicken is a great place to start.  It is unique and yet wondefully familiar.  Not hot, at all.  This dish is superb when served with steamed rice.  This packet makes up easily and tastes the way I remember eating it at Indian places in Singapore.

review/summary: Outstanding, as a starting point!
review/text: I absolutely love this product. However, after making Butter Chicken with this ingredient a few times, I've made it even better. First off, CARAMELIZE the onions first. Let them simmer on low heat for at least half an hour until they're golden brown. Then proceed with the rest of the steps. Towards the end, add a few more tablespoons of butter and a handful of chopped fresh cilantro. Serve with basmati rice and I guarantee this will be as good as anything you've had in a restaurant!

review/summary: Heavenly
review/text: I have been hooked on Jolly Rancher watermelon candies since high school (that's 40 years this year!); they were in the only vending machine in the school...next to the gym. A classmate offered me one and after that I saved up a quarter to get them whenever they appeared. Later on you were able to buy bags of watermelon only candy in the grocery store. Then a few years back Jolly Rancher stopped this practice and only offered the mix of five original flavors. Well, the apple was sorta edible, the others less so, especially the cherry...if you were raised in the early 1960s like I was, you'll remember that EVERY med for children (except for Liquiprim, which was bubble-gum flavored), liquid and chewable was cherry flavored. And the cherry flavor Jolly Rancher tastes exactly like all those awful cough syrups, liquid antibiotics, and whatever else you had to swallow when you were sick. Talk about bringing back bad memories!<br /><br />More recently I had been buying my watermelon Jolly Ranchers at a candy store called Fuzziwigs, but it closed. I was reduced to filching watermelon candies out of mixed bowls at events (my last three came out of the candy bowl the fire department had set up at the Home Show). And then I searched on Amazon...<br /><br />Thank you for one of the best early birthday gifts ever!

review/summary: There are 320 of them!
review/text: The product name led me to believe that the total package is of 160-count, split in two packs of 80-count each. However, there are two boxes of 160-count each.<br /><br />These shipped from Amazon quick, via subscribe and save. When I first signed up, the estimate delivery date was a week later. However, these were shipped the same night, and arrived the next day, 5 days earlier than the estimate. So definitely don't worry about the shipping speed.<br /><br />These are very fresh, unlike some of the old shelf Jolly Ranchers that are kind of melted into the wrapper, and you can't take the wrapping off without your fingers getting all sticky. There is definitely a difference in the freshness,  and it's a good thing.<br /><br />Flavor wise, this is my favorite flavor, and if they came in a mixed-flavor pack I'd pick these out right away. However, having only watermelon, all the time, without having to pick them out, got really old really quick, and kind of ruined the flavor for me. Maybe it's because I ate like 20 of them the first day they arrived. lol.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like the watermelon flavor, definitely get this. A good idea is to buy this, plus a mix-flavor bag, and mix them together. That way, you get some variety once in a while, but still able to eat as much watermelon ones as you want!

review/text: Watermelon Jolly Ranchers are sumptuously good and whether you've got a candy jar on the corner of your desk at work, at home, or need something for a road trip, these are the hands down winners by far.<br /><br />I cannot count how many times I've seen adults pout because there were no more Jolly Ranchers in the candy jar on my desk at work, or how many times grown men would cull through the assortment to find that last, golden Watermelon candy.<br /><br />So, when they started to come out with the mega pack of just the watermelon candies it was a no brainer to grab one up.<br /><br />The problem with that is that they are so good they disappear quickly, and when I found these at a local wholesaler, I paid for one box what they are charging for a double pack here, so BUY, BUY, BUY!<br /><br />The other fantastic feature about these phenomenally delicious watermelon candies is that they are no fat and very low in calories, so you can indulge with big flavor and have zero guilt.
