review/summary: Nice addition to my pantry
review/text: First, these crispy treats are good to eat right out of the bag. To my astonishment (and delight) there is some heat that comes with the jalapeno flavoring. Oftentimes, products are "de-heated" so as not to bother people who don't like a nice heat. But this product is different--and delightful.<br /><br />Second, there are a n umber of uses for this--as crunch for salads, as a topping for casseroles, with macaroni and cheese, and so on. The package suggests a number of different uses.<br /><br />It is also low in bad fats and cholesterol and carbohydrates.<br /><br />Anyhow, a nice addition to the kitchen when one wants a little spiciness and crunch in a dish.

review/text: I love jalapenos on everything, but the first time I found this little jewel in the grocery, I knew I had to try them.  LOVE!  I mean this has to be my newest addiction.  If Amazon will carry, I will sign up for auto ship!  Please, please carry this wonderful treat.  Not too salty, not too heavy, just right!  The perfect little addition to salads, green beans, or really any entree.  Seriously that good!

review/summary: So awesome
review/text: I can get these for $2.99 at our local grocery so the shipping here at Amazon makes them a little too expensive unless it is your only option. The bag really isn't that big. Having said that...these are the BEST! I eat them like potato chips. They are spicy for people who like that kind of thing but they aren't too spicy. Also, the jalapeno-y flavor wasn't too strong which was something I was concerned about. I just wish they sold them in a big potato chip sized bag. :)

review/text: This cinnamon snack has just the right amount of sweetness....just the right amount of cinnamon also. The six ounce package reseals to ensure freshness and avoid crumbs in the bottom of your purse.  The snacks are quite filling, surprisingly so.  If esthetics is important to you, they do look like a little clump of dirt, but you'll forget that impression when you take a bite.  I used these as a dessert with a glass of milk one night and they hit the spot.

review/text: These are extremely healthy, low calorie, low fat, high fiber and protein, morsels to cary you over between meals! I like these and the sea salt versions and find them the perfect snack to take away the edge between meals and even replace a meal if you are in a hurry. Highly recommended. The price was better than purchasing individual sacks at my local supermarket. I'll encourage my local market to bring their prices down a bit so I can support local shopping, but we also have to look after the old pocketbook sometimes! By the way, everyone in the house likes them, even my teen.

Hard to believe considering I didn't expect to like any of them.  I'm not typically a 'healthy snack' kind of person and, in looking at the ingredients, I fully expected to dislike these snacks. Impressive - and you get the added benefit of feeling good about your snacking!  Can't wait to try the sea salt somersaults!

review/text: Ever since I started traveling up to Montreal for business I've been hooked on Van Houtte coffee.  This is by far my favorite blend, bold enough to get you started in the morning, but light enough that it doesn't punch you in the face (I drink my coffee black).  It's a little more expensive than your normal brands, but I'd say it's worth it every single day.

review/summary: Taste vs Goals
review/text: While I agree the taste isn't the greatest, neither is the fat on a body. This is not a product I would recommend switching to if you were simply looking for a jello pudding alternative. You will shock your taste buds! The product is geared for bodybuilders or people used to protein supplements.<br /><br />Another problem is almost as soon as the powder and water merge, it begins to congeal, making it difficult to scrape out of the blender or off the mixer paddles. In other words, you lose a lot of the pudding. However, the powder mix is cheaper than the can contained (premixed) protein puddings I have seen.<br /><br />As far as nutritional value, it is a worthwhile product. (145 cal, 3g fat, 4g carbs, 25g protein) The sodium is a bit high at 550 mg per serving. I usually have one serving if I find my protein is a bit short for the day, so it is not a staple in my diet. I don't think I would be able to eat one every meal or day! I'm leaning more toward obtaining an unflavored protein powder for my low protein days and eat the pudding only once a month or so.

Those expecting traditional lemonade will be confused but if you love the slightly fizzy and tart (not sweet) lemonade you can get in parts of Europe, this is just the thing.<br /><br />I love our Sodastream so much that I got another to keep at my office.  Now I drink plenty of fluids throughout the day without popping $1 each time into a vending machine.  The fact that this is only 35 calories per 8 oz. serving is a giant plus.

review/text: I bought these at the grocery store last week along with the Annie's Cheddar Bunnies.  They're both great.  The whole wheat bunnies are healthy without having that overwhelming "wheaty" taste some people aren't so fond of.  You won't think you're eating a plain goldfish, but my 8, 5, and 1 year old gobble them up and THEY are tough customers.  They have 3g of fiber per serving and with being whole wheat I feel like they're good enough to count as part of my toddler's meal.

review/text: I'm a 60+ male who never outgrew his love of animal crackers.  Problem was that my favorites contained trans fat that I (nor anyone else, for that matter) don't need.  I found these, and they are a great alternative - sort of a grown-up's animal cracker.  One 12 box case is a three month supply, and the price is well under what I find them for in the supermarket, on those rare occasions when I can find them.  If they ever get the salt down, I'll give them 5 stars.

We were hoping to give them to our baby who's starting on biscuits now but we also want to avoid too much salt.<br /><br />I have a hard time telling if the strong flavor is from the salt or the cheddar.<br /><br />Out of the 5 people who tried it here, only my brother said "Mmmmmm Cheddar".  I gave him the remaining 11 boxes and hope I have better luck with the Chocolate flavored ones.

review/summary: Pretty good, could be cheesier!
review/text: I had recently tried the regular cheddar bunnies and just loved them. I thought a whole wheat version would be an even better idea. The nutritionals on these snack crackers are pretty decent per serving, with pretty low fat grams (especially low saturated fat and no trans fat), low sodium, and a couple (2) grams of fiber. However, these do not carry the cheddary taste that the cheddar bunnies did. I do like them, don't get me wrong, I just feel that they could be more flavorful... After trying them, I thought I had erred and not purchased a cheesy cracker. Nope, cheddar is definitely in the ingredients list, just not very high in the flavor palate of the item.

review/text: I received this as a gift.  The packaging is very nice and when I saw it was "keylime" I expected to get a keylime flavor.  Although it tasted good I didn't taste any lime in it.  To me it tasted like any other butter pound cake.  By the time you pay for shipping and handling your paying almost $20.00 for a cake that is just ok.

review/summary: The Recipe needs improvement if it is going to compete against other Brand Name Rum Cakes.
review/text: I purchased 2 flavors of Tortuga Rum cake in the same order, this one and Banana Rum. This one did not live up to expectations unlike the Banana Rum. The flavor was Rum dominated with small hints of Key lime. Although the Packaging Vacuum seal was intact and obviously of a high quality, the cake itself was not as moist as I would have liked it. Comparing it to the Banana Rum cake moisture I can say that the issue must have been with the actual preparation of this cake. I would recommend that Tortuga closely examine the recipe and tweak it a bit. Not that this cake was terrible, but it just was about average at best. In other words it is on the same level as another Brand Name Rum cake one can purchase online, so if they are ok with the competition catching them or maybe even edging them out a bit, then they should not change a thing. But I as a customer have scratched this one of my re-order list for a while until its quality is addressed. I give this Rum Cake a "C+" grade when compared to other Brand Name Rum Cakes.

review/summary: The best reduced caffeine coffee
review/text: It's hard to get excited about decaf.  It usually lacks aroma and body of a good cup of regular coffee.  However, there are times when you don't want the chemical stimulant and Timothy's Rainforest Decaf Expresso is a wonderful stand in for the regular stuff.  Of course it is not caffeine free and part of Rainforest Decaf Expresso's great taste may be due to less processing to remove the naturally occurring chemical.  Since I'm lacking any way to measure the caffeine level, suffice to say that it's more like reduced caffeine coffee with great taste.

Yes that's all, no mixing it with anything you  dont need to mix it to cover odd taste that you sometimes get with tuna. I have not had any dented can or anything like that .

review/summary: beware of carrageenan in this product
review/text: I'm wondering about the carrageenan in this product. Scientific research indicates carrageenan may be risky. For example drweil.com states: "Carrageenan is a common food additive that comes from red seaweed also known as Irish Moss or Chondrus Crispus. Carrageen has long been used as a thickener and emulsifier in ice cream, yogurt, cottage cheese and other processed food products, including soy milk."<br /><br />Dr Weil cites research indicating that "a study published in October 2001 suggest that carrageenan may not be as safe as once thought. Findings from animal studies and a review of the scientific literature showed that degraded forms of carrageenan can cause ulcerations and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract...Dr. Tobacman thinks that undegraded carrageenan - the kind most widely used as a food additive - might also be associated with malignancies and other stomach problems. She suggests that such factors as bacterial action, stomach acid and food preparation may transform undegraded carrageenan into the more dangerous degraded type.

review/text: I am so happy that this product is available via Amazon subscription because our local supermarket raised the price per carton by 70 cents!  I am dairy intolerant, so I use it wherever one would use milk ... as a creamer for coffee & tea, cereals, baking, etc.  One reviewer didn't think it made a good coffee creamer, but if I find it works quite well.  You may need to make your coffee a bit stronger, but just heat the rice milk and use more than you would usually use of 1/2 & 1/2  or soy milk.  I even carry a small bottle of it with me when I'm going to be having coffee or tea at a cafe or restaurant.

review/text: I recently decided to add raw pumpkin seeds (known as "pepitas") to my diet on a daily basis, and wanted the convenience of seeds that were not in the shell. After doing some research on the internet, I bought this directly from Superior Nut based on glowing recommendations from other purchasers. I am very happy that I did.<br /><br />These seeds are fresh, are nice and chewy, and taste delicious. I have not found any seeds that are musty, rancid, or burnt (which apparently can be a problem with other companies). The seeds come in a sturdy resealable bag that helps to preserve their freshness.<br /><br />These make a great snack, are very filling, and are loaded with lots of minerals that contribute to your health. Superior Nut was a pleasure to deal with, and shipped my order promptly.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good company to order a tasty and healthy product from at an economical price.

review/summary: good dog food
review/text: This is great dog food. My 2 bostons have been eating it for years and it is worth every penny. Very high in protien with no fillers. Fills them up faster than regular dog food. Poop really doesn't have a smell, just gets chalky and falls apart. They shed a lot more, smell a lot more and have digestive issues with store bought dog food.<br /><br />Only complaint about this particular order was that there was no indication of how large this bag was. I thought it was the 6 lb bag, which I thought was the smallest bag which normally runs 16-18$ in store. But this was a 2 lb sample bag. No wonder it was on sale for 6.99, still not sure why a 2lb bag would have been over 16$ to begin with though.<br /><br />But you cant go wrong with ordering this food for your dog!it will be great for their health

review/summary: One of the only LG bones on Amazon
review/text: First, this bone is not made in the USA.<br />It is way over packaged and this is important to note: it is baked not smoked. A lot of Vets and folks in the know say that smoking is the only safe way to go to help prevent the bone from splintering. My two girls are 100 lbs each and tear through just about anything so what I get them is important for their safety. To keep them from outright crushing the shank of the bone right away I have to get the super-huge femur bones. No other bones with a shank will do. Like pork bones are just plain dangerous for them. Knuckle bones or ones that 'powder' not splinter are ok. NO rawhide!!!<br /><br />This is a good, large, safe bone. One of the very few Amazon sells. If y'all find a better huge one on Amazon, reply here.<br /><br />My girls rate this a 3 star on taste and chewability btw.

review/text: My husband is a heart patient who must watch his sodium intake.  My eight ball squash has been growing like crazy.  One of his favorite snacks is zucchini bread.  I was able to locally purchase no sodium baking powder, so that was 1/2 the battle.  I knew of the Ener-G Baking Soda, but due to the extreme price point and high shipping costs, I put off buying it until a month ago.  You must use twice as much as normal baking soda, but the end result is very tasty.<br /><br />My four star rating instead of 5 stems from the need to use double the amount and the price.  With shipping it was over $13.00 for the 4.97 ounce container.

review/summary: Health improvement
review/text: This is not a review for using the baking soda for baking.  I have hiatus hernia with the accompanying fiery esophagus and chest pain.  My medication (Omeprazole) dose is at its highest limit and was not doing the job.  I tried another medication (Protonix) and it had horrific side effects for me.<br /><br />I sought help from hiatus hernia sufferers online, and there were two kinds of suggestions for soothing the acid in the digestive system.  One was vinegar and water (too harsh) and one was baking soda and water.<br /><br />Since I was concerned about the sodium in regular baking soda, I sought medical advice.  Information about the availability of your product was given to me.  Hooray!  It is working.  1/2 teaspoon of Ener-G Improved Baking Soda Substitute, Sodium Free in water -- 3 times a day -- has eliminated the fire in my esophagus and the pains in my chest.  No discernable taste and smooth, practically non-discernable texture.  I add a tiny squirt of MIO (Liquid Water Enhancer).  Although I'm hoping to eventually wean myself off of the Omeprazole, I am sure that the Ener-G Improved Baking Soda Substitute will be always be available in my cabinet.<br /><br />I was telling my son yesterday that I'm going to give him some to try for his acid indigestion (especially at night).  If it works for him, I will be buying some from you to give to him.<br /><br />I am so grateful for this product.  I am also going to tell my neighbors about this, since they are on a restricted sodium diet.

review/summary: Only gum on the planet I could find w/o aspartame - YAY
review/text: So this gum is wonderful because it doesn't have aspartame (which = headaches for migraine sufferers). But as far as comparing to other gums, don't chew it unless you have to, like I do. :-)  The taste lasts for about 10 seconds (literally) and the gum tends to stick to your teeth.<br /><br />But to me the health benefits of a gum w/o aspartame (or sugar, as in the case of the sugar-free glee gum) is far beyond the minor disadvantages of the quality of the gum. I particularly chew it for aiding digestion after meals and to quench my need to snack.<br /><br />Also, I recommend chewing two pieces at once. The pieces are the size of Chiclets, so two at a time is really best.

review/summary: Titanic Dioxide is NOT natural
review/text: I was happy to find there are natural chewing gum out there and just bought 12-packs of these.  The ingredients say Titanium Dioxide is also used.  Titanium Dioxide is one of the top 50 chemicals produced worldwide!  Google it and you find that it is "a white, opaque and naturally-occurring mineral found in two main forms: rutile and anatase. Both forms contain pure titanium dioxide that is bound to impurities. Titanium dioxide is chemically processed to remove these impurities, leaving the pure, white pigment available for use."  Titanium Dioxide, especially in ultrafine form, could be carcinogen or disease causing, and we currently still have limited knowledge about its health effects, but does that means we should take the risk?  If Glee Gum added Titanium Dioxide to their gums just because it makes the gums LOOK white and 'pretty', it is a VERY BAD decision.  People choose to buy 'healthier' gum absolutely would not mind how the gums look as long as they are truly natural. I am very disappointed. I really hope Glee Gum removes this chemical from their gum and make truly natural gums.

review/summary: Great concept, but so-so execution
review/text: I am one of those people who has an artificial sugar sensitivity. It drives me nuts knowing that I cannot chew my favorite kinds of gums--primarily because when I chew gum, I'll have about five pieces throughout the day. Apparently, five pieces was enough to start giving me stomach aches and headaches from the aspartame and sucralose exposure.<br /><br />Thus began my search for a stevia (which I freaking LOVE!!) sweetened gum. When I saw Glee Gum, I was excited; not only does the package have a cute design, but I loved what my money was going towards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my excitement died away upon chewing two pieces of this. In less than a minute, the peppermint flavor faded away and I was stuck chewing on a piece of rubber. Not very appetizing. I've gone through the entire pack (you'd need to chew like 8 pieces to be satisfied), but I will not be purchasing this item again.

review/text: In my quest for aspartame-free chewing gum, I decided to try Glee Peppermint gum.  Ho-hum.... it is a tiny bit minty (but not really peppermint) and very sweet.  The sweet and slight mint flavor only last for a minute.  I am okay if the flavor doesn't last too long as long as I have a cool, minty mouth.  There isn't enough mint in this gum.  Additionally, the gum is soft and sticks to my teeth.<br /><br />Nothing objectionable, but nothing remarkable, either.

review/text: I bought these to avoid the artificial sweeteners normally in gum. That's good and the flavor is ok initially, but I guess I'm so used to normal tasting gum that I couldn't get into it. It lost it's "flavor" about 5 minutes into chewing and then it was just a chewing blob. I bought the pack of 12 but only really used 1 pack and tossed the rest after it sat for months. I could see the benefit if you're introducing your child to gum and they have no prior taste from other gum. Personally, not my cup of tea!

She knows she gets the bone after she finishes her dinner. I think she would eat sawdust to get to this bone! Like the original Coke recipe, does it have Cocaine in it? Our dog is a loving, docile pet, but regularly growls if we try to take it away from her...we give her 1/3 of a bone after each dinner meal. Too much of this product seems to effect the stool negatively. If you want  your dog to place you on a pedestal, buy this product!

review/summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BONE, IT WILL MAKE YOUR DOG SICK.
review/text: I bought this bone for our 8 month old schnoodle. He loved it, and ate all of the inside 'meat' within two days. True, he shouldn't have been left to eat it so quickly but he also shouldn't have gotten sick. The day after he started eating this bone, he developed diarrhea with some blood for a couple of days. After a week, he is still having loose stool and yesterday he vomited twice. Otherwise, he has been eating his food and drinking water as usual and is playing like he always does so we have been trying to wait for his system to clear up on its own. Another couple of days of these symptoms and we'll be taking him to the vet. Btw, I did a google search on the Dingo brand for any cases of puppies/dogs getting sick and I found multiple hits where people were talking about their dog having the same reaction as ours did. I also found out that there was a recall on another type of Dingo treat 1 year ago. Please look for another brand of bones for your pet, better to be safe then sorry.
