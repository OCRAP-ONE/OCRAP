review/summary: Great Ketchup!
review/text: I had a lot of curry ketchup in Germany last summer.  This ketchup is really good, but I like it with more curry.  In Germany, the curry  ketchup is almost the color of Heinz 57 steak sauce.  However, this ketchup is really good and those I have given it to, also really like it.

review/summary: Taste of Yesterday
review/text: Black walnuts represent a taste remembered from childhood.  Not to be confused with the easily-obtained Eastern Walnuts, these black walnuts have a characteristic flavor that can't be duplicated.  When used in oatmeal cookies, they produced a flavor that transported us back to when we used to collect and shell these delicious treats.  These nuts, from Superior Nut Company were well-packaged in resealable bags, and can be kept in the freezer for freshness.

review/text: Well, it looks like they took my review off from last week. So, I will re-enter it. After buying 3 1 lb bags for all uses, my family decided to try a handful and everyone stated their throat burned including me. The company said they will refund my money and said they don't have preservatives in them. But, something is wrong. Your throat shouldn't burn after eating a handful of walnuts. Guess that is why they are such a good bargain.

On a positive note, there is no bitterness or sour acid after taste. I wish Lavazza would offer a dark bean at the level of a french or italian roast.  So far I have tried the Gran Filtro Dark Roast, Grand Whole Bean and Qualita Oro with no luck.

review/summary: Great Cat Food
review/text: I have been using this cat food for about a month. Now, I'm not a cat, and I've never eaten it, but both my cats eat it right up. I have a 14 year-old cat with tiny kidneys, who was an outdoor cat until July, when I took her to the vet, and he gave her a 25% chance of still being alive in 2 years. He told me that I need to get her on good, wet cat food. So I bought this, after doing a lot of research. Since purchasing this, she seems to have filled back out (she's very tiny, maybe 4 pounds). She is also peeing a bit less, which is also a good sign that her overall urinary tract is working better.<br /><br />Another good sign for this food comes from my younger cat who is almost 2. I am feeding this to her, as well, and her solid waste has become much less stinky! She has had a VERY stinky litter box from the moment I got her. I've tried different foods (even mixing in some pumpkin, per a vet)to no avail, but since giving her this, her smell is not as strong.<br /><br />So, this is a little bit pricey compared to some foods, but well worth it for the health of my cats, and the sanity of my nose :)

review/summary: these are not real tortillas
review/text: These are not really tortillas, they are very flat circular pieces of bread. Which is fine if thats what you want, but I wanted tortillas.  I loved the Tumaro's tortillas when Amazon carried those, they were healthy, tasty and were tortillas.  These do not bend very well around burritos or "wraps" either as they are so dry.  Also, although these are whole grain, they aren't low calorie or anything.  One tortilla, and mind you these are the small size, has 110 calories and 2.5 grams fat and 330 mg of sodium. And yet, they taste dry and stale.<br /><br />Since the description leaves out the last of the ingredients, I will finish it for them.<br /><br />"Contains less than 2% of the following: Calcium Propionate, Fumaric acid, Aluminum free baking powder, refined odorless and tasteless fish oil, gelatin, tocopherols, natural flavor, citric acid, sodium ascorbate and potassium sorbate. Allergens: Contains wheat, gluten, soy, odorless and tasteless fish oil."<br /><br />I do not recommend these unless you are looking for dry, flat circular pieces of bread with plenty of calories and sodium.

However, I must say that these wraps aren't that tasty. They also tear very easily. I tried using them as sandwich wraps- didn't work out so well. So, now I use them for wraps whenever I'm making a baked Mexican dish. The sauce, vegetables, and spices covers up their not-so-great flavor and it doesn't matter if they break open.

review/text: These WOW Gluten Free Brownies are exquisitely delicious. They are at least as good as brownies made from wheat products, if not better. They are moist and chocolaty. There is no sour or flat taste that is common with many gluten free baked goods. Because there is no gluten there is a lack of chewiness that is common to some fudge brownies, but the moist mouthwatering taste is unsurpassed.<br /><br />I have given these gluten free brownies to people who are not gluten intolerant and they wanted more. WOW knows how to bake!<br /><br />The one caveat, if you are lactose intolerant, is that WOW uses butter as an ingredient. If a dozen are ordered, I would also recommend putting some in the freezer. It helps dissuade from eating all of them at once and keeps them around longer. These are absolutely "finger lickin' good"!

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I am having more and more problems finding bulk cocoa on Amazon, so I ordered this. I keep the packages in separate zip-loc bags when I get them. The texture is different from regular cocoa mixes you get at the grocery store. This is more fine probably due in fact they are used in the large machines at most C-stores. I actually prefer this to the other cocoa mixes because it does dissolve a lot easier in my coffee every morning, I don't have that sludge usually found on the bottom of the mug like with regular cocoa mix. I didn't change the amount I put in my coffee (3tsp) and it tastes the same.  I put this in one of my recycled cocoa mix canisters (47 oz) and it almost reaches the top, just about 1/4 of space left at the top. The price is pretty good since the other product I ordered doubled in price on this website.

review/text: To start this is my first matcha/green tea latte powder that I bought and I have to admit it is really good.  I know they use "unsweetened" matcha in starbuck w/ melon syrup from torani (which they do not sell anymore).  This product already comes sweetened which is great to save money from buying syrups and this items also mixes very well with medium-hot drinks.  My guide to using this is below so its not so sweet to the palette and I use whole milk for the richness.  To close I would recommend this product to anyone and matter of fact about to finish my 3 lbs. bag and buying a refill right now :).<br /><br />Venti = 20oz = 4 tablespoons<br />Grande = 16oz = 3 tablespoons<br />Tall = 12oz = 2 tablespoons

review/summary: almost exactly like starbucks green tea frap
review/text: i just purchased a blender and was seeking out a way to make my own green tea frappicinos.  after reading many reviews i settled on this one.  though its not pure green tea (there are additives), it tastes almost EXACTLY like the starbucks kind.  i think the discrepancy in the flavors is due to the melon syrup.  the kind that starbucks uses is discontinued and after some searching on amazon i found another brand.  i ordered it and hope that it will give my fraps the little kick they need, though they are delish without!!  i will definitely purchase again.  as for the "scoop issue", i use scoop = tablespoon and they taste fine.  i actually like mine with a bit more green tea flavor so i add an extra scoop.<br /><br />***addendum to my review...i ordered the 1883 melon syrup from amazon and it makes my frap taste exactly like the starbucks kind.  i do recommend to only use 1 tbl, i used 2 and it turned out a bit sweet.

review/text: I've purchased several varieties of MoCafe drink mixes and most just specify to use a "Scoop." One variety I purchased did mention what a "Scoop" is, though. It equals 8 tablespoons. It might seem like a lot, but I tried it out and it does give it a stronger (and better) flavor, but I don't think it is necessary and seems a bit excessive (mostly in calories). So, I recommend to just adjust the amount of powder to your taste instead of going by the actual "scoop."

review/summary: MOCAFE Matcha Green Tea
review/text: Tastes artificial and nothing like the fresh flavor Starbucks carries. There is a very very light after taste that resembles the Starbucks brand, but its very faint and only occasional. In fact this resembles sweetened vanilla flavor more than anything Will never buy again.

review/summary: Super delicious!
review/text: So about 15 minutes ago my bag of MoCafe Matcha Green Tea came knocking at my door. Since then I have made myself a smoothie and almost devoured it. The powder is delicious! It's very very close to the green tea frappes at StarBucks and I love that I didn't have to pay $5!<br /><br />The ONLY reason that it didn't get 5 stars is because I feel that the way you measure it is wrong. The packaging says to use 6 oz milk, 12 oz ice and 8 tbsp (which is 1/2 a cup) of the powder. I feel like 1/2 a cup is a lot for the amount of milk and ice. I ended up using 24 oz of ice and it tasted the exact same before adding more ice. I just feel like my powder will last me longer if I don't go by the package directions. It's probably just a marketing scheme by MoCafe to use that much. Use more, buy more often, but that is why I give it 4 stars.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will be buying again.<br /><br />Thanks!

review/summary: Better than Starbucks!!
review/text: As good if not better than Starbucks Green tea chai latte without the high price tag.  I was suprisingly pleased by the taste and sweetness of the drink which I make cold and add tapioca pearls for a refreshing bubble tea.  I looked around for a long time, including Chinatown groceries, for a cheaper alternative to Starbucks and I think this one is it.  Great value, good taste!

review/summary: Just like Star Buck's Green Tea Frappacino
review/text: Two years ago Starbucks got me hooked on their blackberry green tea frappacino & like all the other speciality drinks that they get their customers hooked on - suddenly they dropped it & said it was no longer available.  I have searched high & low to find a similar product & accidentally stumbled across the matcha green tea while looking for the Wild Tribe Mocha product.  I decided to order it.  Imagine my excitement when it came & I made my own Blackberry Green Tea Frappacino at my own home - for a lot less.  Move over Starbucks.  Mine is better.

review/text: Many people drink green tea drinks thinking they're healthy and natural.  The first ingredient in this is sugar (fructose) and the second is non-dairy creamer. Green tea is all the way at the end of the list, third from the bottom.  It tastes good, but if you're looking for a healthy drink, this is not really it.

review/text: I love Starbucks Green Tea Latte, that fresh "grassy or alfalfa" flavor is so refreshing, so when i found this product i was very anxious to receive it. I got it yesterday and have tried it 3 different times and i have to say its nothing like Starbucks.<br /><br />Its way too sweet, has the consistancy of chocolate milk mixed really thick and tastes nothing like the fresh flavor Starbucks carries. There is a very very light after taste that resembles the Starbucks brand, but its very faint and only occasional. In fact this resembles sweetened vanilla flavor more than anything.. almost like a flavored coffee creamer mix in milk.<br /><br />I hope i can locate the brand Starbucks uses.

It isn't too rich and yet it isn't so subtle that you can barely register the banana.  It comes through loud and clear.  The graham cracker is crisp and serves as the perfect canvas for the cr&egrave;me and it is thick enough to be a nice component all on its own.  For a small yet satisfying snack to help you through those midday cravings, look no further.  At just over 100 calories, these little guys will fill you up without weighing you down.

review/summary: EXCELLENT NEW SNACK!!
review/text: I am very impressed with the new Peanut Butter Grahamfuls by Honey Maid, which I just tried for the first time this week. They are fantastic! The portion is quite generous - enough to tame that hunger that gets you between breakfast and lunch. The graham cracker is very crunchy but does not fall apart when you bite into it. The peanut butter filling is thick and satisfying. The overall flavor is very favorable - a tad sweet but not cloying (like so many prepackaged snack bars are). They are very convenient and tidy to eat, and they really help fill the mid-morning hunger void and carry you through to lunch. I'm an adult but these would make a great snack for kids, too - especially after school to carry a kid through until dinner. Pair one with a few apple slices on the side and you've got it made! I really hope these make it on the market and are not discontinued like so many awesome new products tend to be. I'll be buying them every week! Nice work, Honey Maid!!!

These are perfect.  They are moist, full of delicate flavor and a good size for a snack.  How I got to write this review was the original place I found them no longer carries them or only as a seasonal item.  Well I have a craving for them now.  So when I found them at Amazon I tried to order some.  Unfortunately they were out of stock.  I will have to suffer without them.<br /><br />From a long time Rum Ball connoisseur.

review/summary: Mush, water, and not processed?
review/text: No doubt this is a poor product.  When you are done draining out the water to make your sandwich, the chicken amounts to about half this small can.  Also, it is a very milky white in color, even for white meat, which makes me wonder if it is not processed.  There is nothing on the can that states it is not processed, or all natural, which allows Hormel, if this is the case, to use processed parts of the chicken.  Just the mush and too much water is enough to say goodbye to this rip-off.

review/text: I ordered a 12 pack of Hormel Chunk Breast of Chicken, No Salt Added because the description led me to believe this would work well with my dietary needs.  I believed that the product description was complete and accurate, and based my decision to purchase this product on it.  That was a mistake.  The complete product description for this product should include:"contains 2% or less of Modified Food Starch, Sodium Phosphates, Flavoring."  I would not have bought this if I knew it contained any per cent of modified food starch, or flavoring (which "may" mean msg).<br /><br />As for the contents - the chicken was good, though I was a little underwhelmed like some of the other reviewers.  The huge plus was that as one newly on a low sodium diet, you miss the convenience of a meal of say a salad with olives and cheese, and the idea of convenient, already cooked chicken breast not full of sodium (or, I thought, any added carbohydrates) was very appealing.<br /><br />I hope that Amazon will update the product description for this product, it needs to be complete.

That said, it is gluten free and may not be the choice for those not needing gluten free. BUT, you can make pizza (prefer deep dish - which this works GREAT for) for the whole family & not be punishing those that don't need gluten free. For the creative cook, this makes the gluten free premade crusts look like cardboard... And you can make some great breads with this if not up for pizza - without wheat flour.

Buyer Beware, high prices, deceptive product write up and rude service. Abviously they don't need the business. "

review/summary: Wonderful taste
review/text: Remember how we made popcorn years ago?  You'd pour a little vegetable oil in a pan, heat it up, and add just enough kernels to cover the bottom.  Put on the lid and shake periodically.  THIS POPCORN TASTES LIKE THAT!  It is not a "buttery" flavor.  I usually add a little extra salt.  The 100 calorie format makes it perfect for a snack.

review/summary: Good for an office pick-me-up
review/text: When I was a kid, I used to buy boxes full of bubble gum balls and chew them while poring over my latest haul of Marvel and DC comic books.  Other gums have come and gone since then, but these days Dubble Bubble is my favorite gumball - although now I chew them while looking at a computer screen.<br /><br />Awhile back I discovered that a local department store chain stocked 20-ounce milk carton-style packages of Dubble Bubble.  I immediately began buying them for work so I could freshen my breath in an enjoyable fashion after drinking coffee or eating lunch.  Soon, one of my coworkers got addicted to them as well.  So we worked out a deal.  He buys the donuts, and I buy the Dubble Bubble.  Nice.<br /><br />As for the taste - well, back in the day I used to eat them by color, and my favorites were the red (Cherry) and pink (Strawberry).  But now I just take whatever spills out of the carton because they're all good to me.  Yeah, the flavor goes away fairly quickly, and I wish it lasted longer.  However, it's a good excuse to pop in a couple more balls.<br /><br />And what about blowing bubbles, you might ask?  Well, I've never come close to the massive bubbles I used to create with Bubblicious.  I just blew one the size of an orange with a ten-ball wad of Dubble Bubble, so perhaps greater feats of bubble creation are possible.  At least now I don't have to worry about getting gum gnarled in my hair - one of the perks of male pattern baldness, I suppose.<br /><br />Dubble Bubble gumballs are a great pick-me-up, and they smell better on my breath than stale coffee.  Of course, they aren't the healthiest snack around due to the corn syrup flavoring.  But then again, life is 100% fatal, and it's usually the little things - like bubble gum and comic books - that smooth over the rough spots and make it fun.

review/summary: These are, um, interesting.
review/text: I ordered a bunch of these in order to help crave my salty/crunchy cravings given the fact that I'm trying to limit my carb intake.  It's particularly the high-carb empty calories I need to cut out like grains and potatoes.  Well, there goes about 99% of all of the yummy snack foods on the market.<br /><br />Now I gave these a try not expecting much, and I have found that they are extremely interesting.  They are definitely not for everyone, but I found that they did satiate my salty/crunchy cravings.  The texture takes some getting used to, though.  And it helps that I really like cheese.<br /><br />I'm throwing a 3 out of five stars up there.  They are good enough so that I will try other flavors, but they aren't exactly the most delicious snak food ever, either.  I mean, I'd much rather have a plate of nachos or a bag of potato chips, but this will suffice for now.<br /><br />EDIT:  After eating these for a few days, I'm upping my rating to four stars.  The more I eat them, the more I like them.  In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that I even crave them.  I can't wait to try some of the other flavors.  Honey dijon and bacon are the two I'm most looking forward to.
