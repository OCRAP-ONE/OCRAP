review/text: As someone who is trying to lower their caffeine intake, I looked forward to recieving this. I enjoy green tea and thought the taste would be refreshing for the summer. Too bad then that it tastes like mango flavored medicine. I took one sip and gave the rest to a relative.

review/summary: Kool-Aid for adults!
review/text: Blackberry Pomegranate has never let me down before when it comes to flavored drinks.  When I saw this offering and it claimed to be natural I became very interested.  From a packaging stand point, I love the way these little packets can be thrown in a glove compartment, purse, diaper bag or book bag.  They travel well and open easily.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet I would pour the powder into a standard water bottle (16.9 fl oz.) and shake very very vigorously.  I found that if the water was not ice cold and I did not continue to shake vigorously for a minute then there would be flavor crystal sediment on the bottom.  If the water was ice cold, the powder would incorporate well.  The color does stain, so that may be a concern for some.  Now for the flavor aspect...  Personally this Iced Green Tea mix is just too sweet and artificial flavored.  From the first sip I was assaulted by a cloyingly sweet and rather sickening flavor.  I resorted to sort of holding my breath and guzzling down.  When it came to the last quarter of the bottle I would always dump it; just too sweet.  For me, it tasted very much like what I remember red Kool-Aid tasting like when I was young.  I personally don't allow my children to drink red Kool-Aid.  They loved this stuff!  A bit too enthusiastically for my liking.  They would fight over the bottle, which was just plain odd.  Two days passed and when I returned to the cabinet I had discovered that the kids has been sneaking the packets and polished off the whole box.  My husband on the other hand, hated it and he loves sweet drinks.  He didn't like the sweet 'fake' aftertaste (his words).<br /><br />If you like very very sweet tasting drinks and prefer when drinks have that fake 'aspartame' taste then this should be a winner for you.  Our kids aged 9, 8 and 5.5 loved it.  They found it easy enough to mix on their own apparently.  I just wish that the product was a bit more natural and less 'diet'.<br /><br />Recommend only if you fit the the profile of a customer that would enjoy it.  If you love Kool-Aid mixed with way too many portions then you might just enjoy this.  Kudos on the packaging, which is very much like Crystal Light... thumbs down on a very kiddie oriented flavor profile.  Blackberry pomegranate sounds very adult... Kool-Aid not so much.

review/summary: Simultaneously bland and artificial tasting
review/text: I find that these travel-sized "flavor enhancers" are a mixed bag. Some, such as "Mio" Sweet Tea and "Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch" are pretty good for what they are. However, most are just either bland or too artificial-tasting for my palate. Unfortunately, "Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Blackberry Pomegranate", falls into the latter category, somehow managing to taste bland and artificial-tasting, all in one felled swoop.<br /><br />In all, there are far better drink alternatives out there. Avoid.

review/summary: Artificial tasting and yet another sweetener in it
review/text: This product is sometimes advertised as having no aspertame in it, which is true. But it still has an artificial sweetener in it - sucralose. So instead of Satan, you are getting the Devil here ... and they also let this product sail under a false flag, by putting "Tea&Honey" in BIG letters up front. So naturally, you might think that this is an actual healthy product, organic even. Just read the ingredients list and you will quickly recognize what it really is: sugared water with some flavors in it.<br /><br />A brave self-test revealed a strong artificial taste, root-canal-pain inducing sweetness, immediate scratching and itching in the back of my throat, chemical aftertaste - just totally and utterly horrible.<br />A burst of flavor, as the advertising claims? Rubbish.<br /><br />And something else happened to me, which was already described by other reviewers - as soon as I opened the package, a very fine dust emitted which immediately made me cough and gasp for air. I just hope, this stuff is just bad tasting and not toxic on top of it ...<br />Very rarely, I bemoan the  fact that Amazon makes you give at least one star at the review. For this product, I would like to have the opportunity to give no star at all ...

review/summary: fake sugar, fake flavors
review/text: Do you like the taste of artificial sweetener and generic fruitiness?<br /><br />If yes, try this product.<br /><br />If no, stay well away.<br /><br />Despite the claims of tea, honey, strawberry, and acai on the front of the box, it's the ingredients list that gives away the true flavors. Malic acid, maltodextrin, and sucralose are pretty much the only things my tongue registered. I think you'd have to be a professional food taster with an incredibly refined set of taste buds to recognize any hint of green tea or honey.<br /><br />What i really can't grasp is why they bothered putting any real sugar in this in the first place. Why not make it 0 calorie and skip the sugar entirely, instead of putting the 10 calories (per packet, which is two servings, hence 'only 5 calories per serving!') in with no effect whatsoever on the taste of the product.<br /><br />And worse yet, if they're going to grossly oversweeten it, why not use a zero-calorie sweetener like stevia that doesn't taste like a chemical factory exploded on your tongue?<br /><br />People who consume enough fake sugar that they've lost the negative reaction to the chemical aftertaste of those products will probably find this product pleasantly sweet and fruity. Everyone else, well, just don't buy this.

review/summary: its like kool-aid for adults
review/text: I found the taste to be very strong, so only using half of the package per large cup of water is a good idea.  Even just using half the package, there is still a real lot of flavor and it is hard to believe there isn't a lot of sugar in it, as it tastes so sweet.  You don't have to worry about mixing it, as the package states, as it dissolves well and whatever is left over will dissolve in the next serving anyway.  I found myself going to the water cooler about two to three times more often than normal because it tastes so good.  Both the flavors I had were good so you will probably be pleased with any of the flavors you try.

review/summary: Weird after taste.
review/text: I added a package of the lipton to go to a 16.9 oz water bottle like the instructions say. I decided not to add the entire package all at once because I have read it is a bit too sweet. The first thing I noticed is the granules are pretty big, and it took a lot of shaking and even letting it sit a bit before it dissolved all the way.<br /><br />Right away I could smell a fruity but chemical like fragrance when I opened the bottle. The first sip it tasted watered down because I didn't use the whole package but at the same time it is overly sweet. Tastes like sugar water. I went ahead and put the whole package in, and it did darken the water to a nice burgundy color. With the whole package in it, it does give it more of a flavor and doesn't taste watered down, but it is still sweet. It has a weird after taste and I taste no honey at all. I do kind of taste the pomegranate but I don't really taste any tea or honey. Every morning I have hot lipton black tea and add honey. So, I know what tea with honey tastes like and this is not it.<br /><br />The weird after taste really gets to me. I don't know what it is but it distracts from the overall taste and makes me not want to really drink it. I don't know how to really describe it, almost a cardboard taste to it. It is funky.

review/summary: Very sweet & a little misleading
review/text: While this is a tasty tea I found that it was a little too sweet for one 16 oz bottle of water. I put it into a larger cup and diluted it a bit more which brought out the mango and pineapple flavors more. It still has a "diet" aftertaste which I'm not thrilled about, but I do appreciate that it doesn't have aspartame in it. These handy packets would be good to travel with, especially when traveling abroad where you shouldn't drink anything other than bottled water. I also thought that the nutritional information is a little misleading. The front of the package boasts that it's only five calories per 8 oz serving, but these are made to be poured directly into a 16 oz bottle of water so in reality there are two servings per packet, making it ten calories. Not a lot of a difference, but for a calorie counting person it is a difference.

review/summary: This is tea? Really?
review/text: What I expected: Something that tasted like green tea with perhaps a hit of honey, strawberry, and acai flavor, finished with the typical sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />What I got: A pleasant tasting strawberry soft drink with very little sugar-free aftertaste.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the taste of this drink is quite nice. The strawberry flavor is quite fresh-tasting and at room temperature is very fragrant. It's just not at all what I'd expect for a product from Lipton calling itself "Green Tea Mix". The powder dissolves very quickly, even when stirred with a spoon in an open glass (vs shaken in a bottle).<br /><br />So why only three stars? Like I said, I expected green tea. I got strawberry drink. If you're looking for strawberry, this is very good. If you're looking for tea, move along.

review/summary: Better than most
review/text: This came in a small box of ten foil packages three inches long and a half-inch wide.  There is a cut at one end that allows you to open the foil package so none of the usual difficulties with getting these things open just to spill out some of the contents. The package says to mix with one 16-ounce bottle of water.<br /><br />The powder mixed into the water completely by the time I was ready to put the lid on to shake it up.  It turned the water a light pink.  This flavor of Stix To Go does not have aspartame in it.  The box says sweetened with honey and indeed honey granules are the first ingredients, however there is also sucralose, similar to Splenda.  There is also maltodextrin, which is often used in soda or candy as a thickener, but it is made from real food not chemicals.  The other ingredients are the flavors and hibiscus extract.  WebMD says that hibiscus extract is used to improve odor, flavor, and appearance of tea.  The package also says that a serving size is half of a package at five calories, but you are told to add the whole package to a bottle of water, so beware if you are counting calories.<br /><br />The taste is not bad.  I do not drink anything with artificial sweeteners because I cannot stand the aftertaste, but I did not notice an aftertaste with this.  There is a slight aftertaste, but it did not last.  If think you are getting tea you are not.  This taste like kid's strawberry drink.  If you just can't drink water then you would probably like this.

review/summary: OK - But I would Not Go Out Of My Way For It
review/text: Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix is convenient and refreshing. One "stick" makes 16 oz of iced tea when mixed with water. (Note, the nutrition information shown on the package is for 8 oz, so you need to double the nutritional values if you consume the whole beverage.)<br />The tea crystals do not dissolve easily, it will take some time to do it right. The flavor is variable, from sweet to sour to bitter at times.<br />The sweeteners include honey, sugar and suclarose (Splenda.) Blackberry and pomegranate is an odd combination,  but is not too bad. The packets are small and easy to carry around with you. If you like, you can just dissolve a packet into a 16 oz container of bottled water on the go. It is an ok drink, but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

review/summary: Sucralose AKA Nutra-sweet and maltodextrin CHEM Tea
review/text: Tea&Honey hmmm sounds like it might be all natural but it's NOT. Before I even opened this box, the smell of it turned me off. I poured this into 20 ounces of water which was even more then the 16 oz it called for and then tasted it, GACK, this is clearly not honey!  One swallow and I tasted this in my throat and mouth for an hour and the after taste is horrible. Even the glass I poured it out of, I couldn't get the smell out of even after washing it. This is so putridly sweet I could barely swallow it. I assumed this was as the front of the box said in BIG letters Tea&Honey, well it's not just sweetened with honey. The misleading product labeling did not clearly state that this is full of Sucralose (Nutrasweet by another name) and Maltodextrin two products I would NEVER put in my body knowingly. Both make me sick and give me migraines. Question is WHY? Why would you put artificial garbage, chemical sweetener in green tea that was already sweetened with sugar and honey?<br /><br />Lipton, this product is very misleading. You should Clearly state "Artificial Sweetener" and or "Diet" on the FRONT of the package so people who care what they put in their bodies won't buy this by mistake. Can't you just keep it all natural?

The immediate smell when I first opened the package brought me back to sitting on the counter as a kid while my filled that huge green pitcher, right before we dumped that magical powder turning water into the sweet taste of my childhood.<br /><br />It may very well be sweetened with honey, but it still has a very slight saccharine taste. An odd thing about this drink mix is the variation in flavor depending on how much water you add to the mix. You have to go pretty light on the water if you want it to taste at all like tea, but that makes the saccharine taste a little too strong. Heavier on the water makes it taste like Kool-Aid. That's fine with me, because I like Kool-Aid. This may, however, be an expensive way to go about a glass.

review/text: This was my first drink mix and since then I've tried others to get a better sense if what I observed and tasted was present in all mixes or unique to Lipton's To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix, Honey, and Pomegranate. Overall, I immensely enjoyed the honey and pomegranate flavoring. It can be a tad sweet but you can always add water or use less mix to compensate. The only concern is the time it takes for the mix to dissolve. Many other mixes are able to dissolve almost instantly; however, with Lipton's, you've got to shake the drink for at least a good five minutes before the mix clumps completely breakdown otherwise you'll be feeling granules of mix grating in your mouth. Other than this, I think it's refreshing and tasty drink mix.

review/summary: Ok as a drink mix, but not great as actual green tea...
review/text: The Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced tea mix is a convenient way to get your green tea mix in a hurry, but to be honest, you might want to go another route if you're really looking for green tea. There really wasn't all that much of a green tea flavor, although the strawberry acai is there and quite noticeable (I'm assuming these are artificial flavors). It tastes decent, but to be honest, this strikes me as being something closer to Kool Aid than "tea." It just doesn't taste all the natural to me, and if I'm drinking green tea, that's something I expect. It's not awful, and depending on the choices available, I'd probably drink it again.<br /><br />For those complaining about this having artificial, chemical sweeteners and that Lipton is falsely advertising this as being sweetened with honey, use some common sense. Honey has 22 calories per teaspoon and you'd need a whole lot more than one of them to sweeten a 16 ounce beverage. More or less all of the "Stix" type drink mixes have to use artificial sweeteners...the packaging is too small for a sugar or honey-sweetened mix.

review/text: I first purchased Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookie in the Caramel Apple flavor. While it was tasty and very fulfilling, I wasn't forsure if I was in love with them (and really, why waste your time eating something you don't love?) So, based on customer reviews I then tried the Morning Glory Breakfast cookie.. I loved the bits of nut and again, it was tasty and fulfilling, but was I in love with it? No, not really...<br /><br />I again began browsing the cookie flavors and spent time reading customer reviews and decided to try the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chunk and all I can say is third times the charm. These breakfast cookies are knock your socks off delicious ! I plan on stocking up so that I don't have to order over the hot summer months (as I have read on some of the cookie reviews that because these cookies are so fresh and have no preservatives to prevent spoilage that they are prone to mold if left out to long), so I figure, why take the chance? I'm just going to make several purchases before summer gets here!!!<br /><br />I totally recommend these breakfast cookies! Yes, they are a little high calorie, so you might not want to use them as a snack, but for a meal replacement they are fantastic ! I love the natural ingredients and I know these cookies are fresh (makes you wonder how "fresh" those meal replacement bars are that sit on the store shelf for months?)

review/summary: Recipe change?
review/text: About two years ago, I used to buy these cookies all the time from Amazon.  I loved them, but they disappeared from the website for a long time!  Finally, I found them again and excitedly purchased a new batch.  They're different than they used to be--they're more dry, hard, and have much fewer chocolate chunks in them.  I think they might have 20 or 40 fewer calories in them, though.  But I would much rather have back the soft, moist, chocolatey cookies I knew and loved.

review/summary: GREAT Option for HEALTHY Breakfast On-the-Go!
review/text: We gave these a try during an Amazon sale on Erin Baker products.  I really didn't expect them to be as wonderful as they were.  Immediately upon receipt we stuck them in the freezer (as instructed on the package to maintain freshness).  When we need a quick on-the-go breakfast that packs a yummy yet healthy punch, it's easy to grab one of these and eat it on the run.  The taste and texture are both really good with no odd flavors, just a subtle peanut butter flavor punctuated by chocolate.<br />Our family will definitely reorder these and try the other Erin Baker varieties!  Thank you Amazon for carrying this healthy, yummy option for families on the go!

review/text: I was not sure about these are the Chocolate Vegan cookies the reviews were all over the place.  I ordered being concerned.  These cookies are good.  Agree they don't have a lot of peanut flavor.  I froze mine when they arrived.  I microwave them 35 seconds in the mornings.  They are wam and good.  I usually have oatmeal or a clif bar.  These are more filling than the clif bar.  Will buy them again.

review/summary: Good - but not much peanut taste
review/text: The only real drawback to this cookie is that there's no real "peanut butter cookie" taste.  The texture is wonderful: chewy, moist, with lots of chocolate chunks.  It tastes more like a regular oatmeal chocolate chip cookie, but not as "sugary" sweet.  I have tried many of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies, and this is probably my second favorite.  The Double Chocolate Chunk is wonderful!  I have also tried the Caramel Apple, which was good, and the Morning Glory, which is very good.  I am just more of a chocolate and peanut butter type of gal.  I will always keep these in my freezer.  I take one out the night before, and bring it to work with me for breakfast.  They are simply marvelous!!

review/summary: Could be better....
review/text: First I would like to say that I am not Vegan.  I bought these because I had hoped there would be less fat and more peanut butter flavor.  The Peanut butter flavor is there but it isn't very strong.  I could taste banana and cinnamon more than I could taste anything else.  The chocolate had an odd flavor but that could be because it wasn't made with milk.  Even after all of this, the cookies are still very good.  My kids love them and try to eat them as snacks.  We have tried several other flavors and this is one of the best ones.  I still love the chocolate chunk the best :)

review/text: The cookies arrived on time, and they were safely packaged in a refrigerator bag. The cookies taste amazing, the texture was smooth, and chewy, I could taste the peanut butter, and the chocolate chunks were a perfect addition to the cookie. Afterwards, I was pretty satisfied.  I highly recommend it as a snack, breakfast food, even a dessert. Although, I only bought it once the price was little bit too high for my budget, of course if with more room in my budget I would buy it again.

review/text: These are delicious and filling!  I like that they're vegan!  They're a filling breakfast for on the run days!  The big thing about these breakfast cookies is that they need to be refrigerated.  We didn't do that once and several cookies grew mold in just a couple days of room temperature.  This is also a problem because ups sometimes leaves them on our front steps rather than our porch and they have gone unnoticed for a couple days a few times that we've ordered them.  Erin Baker's customer service is really friendly and helpful, and the cookies actually taste better cold than room temperature!!

review/text: When I moved away from Bellingham, where this business is based, these cookies are one of the things I missed. I'm so happy to find them on Amazon!<br /><br />Note that these are not cookie-cookies: they aren't the baked version of candy. They are sorta dry, hearty, not too sweet, and extremely filling. They will get you through to lunch, and go very well with coffee, tea, milk, or whatever you drink in the morning. They also make a good on-the-run lunch food: an alternative to the overly sweet "sports" bars or "meal-replacement" bars.

review/summary: Love these cookies!
review/text: My husband found these cookies at the expo for his first marathon and we've been hooked ever since. We would often stock up at the grocery store when they went on sale for $1. Since then, we've moved and can't find them in a grocery store, but the internet always sells the things you want!! I like the Double Chocolate Cherry Chunk the best, but the cookies with peanut butter and chocolate are great too!<br /><br />As for getting them shipped - the quality of the cookie seems to vary from shipment to shipment. I've not gotten cookies that are "bad" but often squished or some times close to expiration. (that could happen with any grocery product purchased on line)<br /><br />As I said, my husband found these through running, so they're clearly good for that (needing extra calories after 15 miles). I also enjoyed them while pregnant and now nursing, since I need extra calories. I've looked for an alternative (something slightly cheaper) but other brands do not use all natural ingredients and are generally not as good for you. I've also found other brands have smaller portion sizes, so be careful when comparing.<br /><br />Bottom line - have and would recommend to friends. Try other flavors if you don't like this one.

review/text: All of the Erin Baker cookies are a good alternative to protein and energy bars for a pre or post-workout snack when you need something portable and easy to eat.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, I have no problem with them. These are not Nestle's toll house cookies, they have more fiber and less sugar and fat weight for weight, so they aren't meant to be desert treats.<br /><br />They serve their purpose-a high density, nutritious snack that will supply you with energy when you need it.  With subscribe and save, they are less than a dollar each, and provide more sustained energy than a candy bar, and better taste and texture than a protein bar, which tend to be low in fiber.

review/text: i find these cookies wonderful. i am a vegan and look on amazon frequently to find new things to eat that are not at my local stores or too expensive at organic markets.<br /><br /> amazon recommended this company to me. sadly they only have two vegan flavors that i saw. but i went out on a limb to get these and i am happy i did so.<br /><br /> they do not have a super strong peanut butter taste but you know it is there and there are good size chunks of chocolate. i havent had it heated yet but by others reviews i see i should and i bet it is tasty. the calories are a little high 320 but when you look at other things you can have for breakfast this is not a bad deal. i think it is good to know that these are made fresh. i stuck mine in the freezer so i dont feel like i have to have one everyday for 12 days so they do not go bad.<br /><br />i have just purchased the other vegan flavor and got another one of these so i can have them ready when i want them in the freezer. i think i will keep these as a regular in my amazon purchases.<br /><br />deff worth a try.

review/text: So I have had several flavors of these breakfast cookies and have to say this is one of my least favorite flavors. I think the flavors that are built on oatmeal are better because they taste like they should, like the oatmeal chocolate chunk with raisins are better than these because they taste like an awesome oatmeal cookie with add-ins and not like a oatmeal cookie trying to taste like a peanut butter cookie. The chocolate chocolate chunk ones are three stars too for the same reason. The oatmeal flavors are all 5 stars!

review/summary: BEST COOKIES ON EARTH!
review/text: Of course this is just my opinion but read the label!I have written other reviews for these so Ill try to be a little different.  The ingredients are impressive. We have so far purchased the CARAMEL APPLE:love the gooey texture and a definite hit with everyone, PEANUT BUTTER  and CHOCOLATE CHUNKS;Not too much peanut butter taste and  just the right amount of chocolate pieces, love the chocolate pieces melted and squishy FRUIT AND NUT; Love the texture of the nuts in this one. great flavor. BANANA  AND WALNUT; reminds me of banana bread kind of in a cookie.Love texture of walnuts. All the cookies are moist.  Freeze them immediately as they have no preservatives. Microwave them about 25 seconds or more to your liking. Yummy!  They are soooo good.  I have a bile duct disease and have to be careful what I eat.  I can eat these for a week, with lots of fluids, for every meal and two snacks (5 a day) and I feel better and have more energy. Most importantly, I do not have the terrible stomach pains as I do with most everything else I eat. We are going to order the automatic monthly order of 10-12 bags a month. These are addictive. we are out right now and  I just ordered more. Hate the waiting! These are easy for my mom, who has Alzheimers to fix too. She and my son love them. Please try these. You won't be sorry.  They are affordable at about 1.00 a cookie which is a meal for us and healthy eating.

You all can't say that it is because we aren't used to healthy eating.  Now, back to the cookies...they just are gross. I don't know what else to say, they are dry and tasteless discs comparable to cardboard.  So very bummed out that they aren't what we were hoping for.  Back to granola bars I guess.  :( O and just cause it says cookies does not mean it is good.

review/summary: Does not dry overnight; thick gel hard to apply evenly
review/text: Wilton's Black Sparkle Gel icing looks and tastes good, but the thick gel is difficult to apply evenly.  I used it on sugar cookies to make "ladybug spots and antennae," which worked out fine, but the applicator and thickness of the icing made drawing fine lines (e.g., for piping ladybug "heads") very difficult.<br /><br />But the biggest drawback for me is that this icing does not dry quickly (I left my cookies on a cooling rack for 8 hours overnight, at which point the icing was still wet.  After putting the cookies in the oven for 10 minutes at 200 deg. F, and cooling them, the icing was less wet, but still tacky and not ready for bagging.)  I have since read from reviewers elsewhere that this icing takes 2 to 3 days to dry.  It would've been helpful to see this noted on the packaging.  I would not recommend this for decorating cookies; after 2 to 3 days for drying, your baked goods will have lost much of their freshness.

review/text: Let me start with the positive: This set has the potential to make a great gift.  Sure you could go out and buy the idividual items for a cheaper price (and if you are purchasing for yourself I would recommend that).  But it is a nice set to give as a gift.  It comes packaged in a nice box, and if you receive it in good condition your gift will be a hit.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I decided to look past the several negative reviews regarding the busted bag of rice.  I figured this issue must have been solved by now and/or couldn't possibly happen to me as well.  I was dead wrong.  I just received my package and just as others have explained, the bag of rice was busted and the entire box is full of loose rice.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />I was very excited about this gift.  I even purchased several other sushi-related items to give along with it.  Unfortunately, I would be embarrassed to give this gift in the condition I received it. Now I have 4 days until Christmas to come up with a whole new plan.  Thanks for nothing Amazon.<br /><br />If you are a risk taker, go ahead and give it a shot.  Maybe you will be luckier than the rest of us and receive a perfectly good set.

review/text: This kit includes all the dry components to make sushi, and its a great starter kit.  However, I was disappointed by the book that was included.  I expected a book with colorful pictures and a variety of different types of sushis you can make, etc.  The book was not easily organized and not colorful, and only included a few sushi recipees.  I would recommend getting another book to supplement your sushi making desires.

review/summary: Great Little Sushi Making Kit
review/text: This kit is a great gift idea and a really good way to start making yer very own bonafide sushi -- both nigiri (rice ball) and maki (roll). All you need is an expert fish buyer, a knife that is sharp as h**l, and some itty bitty little bowls for soy sauce. Everything else is IN THE BOX. Sushi Chef brand soy sacue is the best soy sauce you ever had, IMHO.<br /><br />The little instruction booklet is great. Of course, this kit is no substitute for years of apprenticeship with a Tokyo master chef, but, if you have some appreciation for the aesthetic of sushi and a flare for D.I.Y. and access to sushi-grade fish, then this is the kit for you.

review/summary: Good if you don't want to just get the stuff on your own for a lot less...
review/text: It's an ok set if you don't want to go out and buy these very basic ingredients and two simple tools (bamboo mat and wooden spatula) on your own for a lot less.  This REALLY SHOULD INCLUDE A SMALL JAR OF TOASTED SESEME SEEDS for the money you are paying but doesn't!<br /><br />But it does get you started and will allow you to make some basic sushi.  Like other people have said the cookbook included is just terrible!!  It talks about toasting the nori even though the package of nori already says "toasted nori"!  The cookbook is just terrible.  In trying to follow it to the letter for making the rice I burned the hell out of it!  But you learn what you realy need to do quickly.<br /><br />Bottom line the cookbook included is about the worst cookbook ever written, the "kit" could be gotten for half as much or less, and it should have included sesame seeds.. Still a decent gift and will get you started.

review/summary: everything you need in one box
review/text: I have been a sushi fan for many years, but have always been shy about making it myself.  After searching online at the dozens of different options, I decided to go with the Sushi Chef Sushi Making Kit.  And I wasn't disappointed.  Too many sushi kits out there offer just the rolling mat, or dishes and the rolling mat, but no spoon, or all the dishes but no edible components.<br /><br />With this kit, you have the mat, the spoon, and all the edibles necessary sans the actual fillings (fish, veggies, etc.)  And not only does the kit have edible components, they are top notch.  The wasabi is scorchingly spicy, the rice vinegar is tangy, and the rice cooks and clumps together with ease.  The soy sauce and wasabi are so good, in fact, that I would go out of my way to buy them if I saw them at a store somewhere.<br /><br />But, the best part of this kit is the manual.  It's straightforward, written in simple English, and has very nice photos.  As I read each page of instructions, I feel like I'm being walked through step-by-step by a close friend.  I made darned good sushi my very first try.<br /><br />Criticisms?  Hmmm... not many.  The price is right.  Maybe it'd be nice if they had a special "sushi knife" or something enclosed, but whatever.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're looking to make sushi at home for the first time, you won't be sorry with this purchase.

I was very disappointed to see that the kit was made up of very cheap items that if bought individually will come up to 1/3 of the price. The kit contains mainly ingredients not sushi making equipment. I would suggest that you look around for a better more reasonable set.

review/summary: ok kit, some components not so good
review/text: I would buy this again, with a caveat. Some of the parts of this kit were of poor quality. The Nori, seaweed for rolling, was of poor quality, brittle and broken and unusable.  The instructions are adequate.  The kit includes everything and is a good place to start. If it were not for a few poor quality parts, I would give it a 5 star. Use Saran wrap on your roller and life will be easier. Following instructions for rice came close to burning rice  instructions not fully complete, limp recipes.  I wanted something all in one to start out, and this provided it, found out some of the components were of poor or mediocre quality.

review/summary: Less than the sum of its parts
review/text: This is a basic kit that may be of use to a beginner living in the sushi wilderness--away from large cities with Asian stores or even supermarkets that regularly carry Asian cooking ingredients. But if you have access to such locally, this kit is a waste of money. The most functional part of the kit is the "sushi mat", which is a collection of bamboo "straws" lined up and tied together to provide a rollable surface to make maki rolls. The rice spatula is a useful device, but the two of these together should cost about $2, although some supermarkets charge up to $5-7 for the privilege. The rest of the items--mainly food ingredients--are low quality and preservative laden. For half the price of the kit, one could pick up a tube of prepared wasabi (doesn't last as long as the powder but is usually more potent and easier to deal with) or a small can of powder (both about $3 each), a bottle of basic Kikkoman soy sauce (far higher quality even in the basic supermarket variety--will set you back between $2 and $4, depending on location and promotions). A pack of nori sheets will set you back another $5-6, unless you only shop at Whole Foods. The most expensive item might be the rice vinegar--pretty much any Japanese or pseudo-Japanese brand will do (Nakano [same as Mizkan], Mitsukan, and Marukan are the most common). With soy sauce and with vinegar, it's important to get the Japanese, not the Chinese varieties, as the flavors and concentrations will differ. The vinegar should always be unseasoned--then follow almost any internet recipe for seasoning sushi rice. Seasoned vinegars tend to be overflavored (salt, sugar) and are generally less desirable, although they will do in a pinch. Ideally, you should have a bottle of mirin (usually billed as "rice wine") on hand, but can either skip it entirely and add a touch more vinegar or use dry sherry in small quantities. The packaged pickled ginger (gari), including the one in the kit, is often an overly sour, cough-syrup-tasting mess. Unless you are going to make your own, you might as well skip it entirely. The enclosed rice is short grain, but not a high-quality sushi variety. You can just as well do with commercial short-grain rice (avoid long-grain or perfumed rice, such as basmati or jasmine). If you can get a hold of one of the Japanese brands (all grown in California!), so much the better.<br /><br />Aside from preparing the rice, you really don't need a cookbook and paying about $20 extra for it is really not a worthwhile exercise. The beauty of sushi is that you can pick and choose the ingredients that go in as "stuffing". If you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of raw vegetables and cooked ingredients that you can find. If raw fish is your bag, be careful where you buy it and how you store it--some regulations require sushi-grade fish to be deep-frozen once, then thawed properly before sale. If this is not done properly, the flesh will be off-color, watery and fibrous, as if after a freezer-burn. Supermarket grade raw salmon is not a good substitute either, as it is not handled with proper standards of cleanliness for sushi-grade fish. Avoid lake fish, as they often contain parasites (killed in proper cooking). When out of options, you can always use smoked salmon from a supermarket, other kinds of smoked fish or imitation crab flakes. The best option may be a lightly seared tuna steak, but these are very expensive. Fresh-caught saltwater fish is usually OK. Vegetables can be raw or cooked, but they should be cut into 1/4" strips for use in maki rolls (or sliced diagonally for nigiri). Assembly is simple--for nigiri, just make an oblong rice "ball" from seasoned rice assemble all the "toppings" in reverse order on one hand, pick up the rice ball with the other, then join them together and lightly crimp the toppings on top of the rice. You can use a small dollop of wasabi as a binder, placing it on top of the rice ball before attaching the toppings. If maki assembly instructions don't come with your sushi mat, all you need to know is that the layer of rice should be about 1/4" thick and the "toppings" or "stuffing" go across the mat, closer to the edge from which you start rolling. Also, leave about 1/2" of nori uncovered, so that you can seal the edge once the maki is rolled up. It is quite common to line the sushi mat with two layers of plastic wrap (on both sides!) to simplify the process (and, in some cases, to satisfy sanitary regulations--not applicable at home). Other than the amount, there are really no limits on toppings, as long as they are not liquid.<br /><br />Bottom line is that the kit is serviceable, but with middling or low quality ingredients. It will do in a pinch, but is overpriced and somewhat overhyped. Don't expect to come up with sushi-bar-quality rolls from it, but if you're a novice, this makes for a good introduction.

review/summary: something to consider
review/text: First things first, this is a great kit.  My girlfriend and I love sushi and love to try new cooking.  So I thought that this would be a great idea.  And it was. We had so much fun creating our own rolls with ease, and produced a very edible california roll on our first attempt.  The only thing I would recomend is take where you live into consideration.  We live in a small town where there is no asian food markets(within two to three hours) and where we get our fish is from the local Albertsons. Granted, we bought a tuna steak, that the butcher told me was sushi grade, and it turned out really good for cheap, but the other sushi grade fish that I would like to have is not available, such as eel or soft shelled crab or any type of fish eggs.<br /><br />In short on our first sushi night we created two cali rolls, a spicy tuna, our own twist on a philly roll, and a makeshift tempura roll.  All with the kit and some items from the store.  And all were really good.  But my favorites arent do-able, like unagi or a rainbow roll or anything with masago because of where we live. So just think about it.<br /><br />But great gift idea for cheap, or for a relationship date night item. We had so much fun

review/text: Got this just a week ago so I could send hubby with better lunches for work. I love the kit. Everything in it is delicious.<br /><br />I have only one gripe. The method for making sushi rice with a pan. Skip it. Just bring the water to a boil and then turn it down to medium low and watch it. I am looking for brown rice to use for this(I know its supposed to be a no-no but they had to use something like it when they first started making sushi- white rice being a recent thing) but can't find any fat rice.<br /><br />Good luck if you buy. it takes a little getting used to and yes.. buy more Nori sheets. It runs out quick.

review/text: Whatever you do, don't follow their instructions for steaming rice. You will end up with a burnt pot of crap.  Secondly, there isn't enough rice in the package for a second try.  Go buy some short grain rice and follow the package instructions for cooking/steaming rice. Then go back to the Sushi Chef instructions for cooling/seasoning the rice. Good thing I spent all that time preparing ingredients for making sushi while the rice was burning. Now I have to go out for more rice.

review/summary: A good introduction to sushi!
review/text: Despite my niece telling me that what we make with this kit would "never taste like restaurant sushi," we had tremendous fun and made some absolutely delicious California rolls, according to my whole family!  Sushi-making is not for the faint of heart...or those who have a short attention span....as it takes some reading and study to make the rice (cook over this heat, lower to this heat, let sit for xxx minutes, cool quickly by fanning for xx minutes, etc.) properly.  It is also labor-intensive to prepare all the fillings if you want a variety of rolls (we had shrimp, lobster product, crab product, salmon, and even homemade chicken salad).  But in the long run, we had such fun and were so proud of the finished rolls displayed on the plates with the side of ginger that it was most definitely worth it.<br /><br />One tip: make sure you have a really, really sharp knife, and that you clean it with a wet cloth between slices--you'll be glad you did!<br /><br />I have some criticism of the book which could be more organized, explain steps much better, and, in fact, it would be wonderful if the kit included a CD of how to make the different types of sushi, since it is somewhat complicated.  For this reasonm, I would definitely recommend that a beginner find a video on YouTube that shows how the make sushi--very helpful.<br /><br />One other criticism is that I think the kit should include more than just 10 sheets of nori.  Half the bag of sushi rice was just about right for making 10 california rolls, so now I have another half bag rice left (and of course plenty of ginger and the condiments).

review/text: I've never made sushi before, but I've always loved it and really wanted to give it a go. After purchasing this item, my wife and I put on a little get together with a bunch of our friends. The hardest part is making the rice which took a little over 2 hours to be ready. Making the rolls turned out to be a lot easier then anticipated, though you definitely want to try and cover your bamboo roller in clear wrap or something similar to avoid complications. The little book that came along with the set does explain quite a bit of what you'll want to do when preparing your ingredients and how to pay attention to detail. I actually went on Youtube and they have some videos showing you how to make the same rolls from the Sushi Chef Kit which was a real life saver. Everything turned out great and our guest's left happy.

The included ingredients (rice, soy sauce, ginger, etc.) are all top quality though I would have preferred something a bit more natural. When these run out I will try looking elsewhere for the same quality but maybe also organic. A really great gift for someone who loves sushi but hasn't made any themselves.

Buy this to begin your sushi making along with this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764544659">Sushi For Dummies</a>.  You'll probably want the physical book because you'll want to have it on hand when actually ROLLING the sushi and your fingers will be so dirty, you won't want to mess up your kindle.

review/summary: Good kit
review/text: Nice kit with everything you need to start making sushi except the veggies and fish.  Of course you could just go out and buy all of this at the store.  No issues with freshness of the products.

review/summary: great gift
review/text: we have had a few small "sushi-making" parties at the house since getting this kit and have really enjoyed it. the kids even like it because we can make them rolls with what they like inside. we have a kid who doesnt eat seafood but really likes a roll with deli roast beef, a scallion and some sharp cheddar. we roll it with rice and he dunks it in a little worcestershire sauce.<br />i definitely recommend this kit. great starter set...

review/summary: Sushi Chef
review/text: Excellent product, detailed instructions on how to prepare the rice. Has a few recipes for rolls, would have liked a few more, but that's what the internet is for. Was very nice having everything right out of the box. I would suggest using a zip-lock bag or plastic wrap for the rolling mat if you wish to preserve it for future use. The sushi I made turned out pretty amazing, all on my first try.<br /><br />I would suggest this product to anyone who is interested in this hobby.

review/summary: Good kit for beginners, but poor food quality
review/text: This had everything in it that we needed to make our own sushi rolls, but the quality of the food inside the kit (rice, ginger, wasabi, and seaweed) was pretty poor.  The tools in it (rolling mat and spoon) and we enjoyed it.  Wouldn't buy a second kit, but the first one was worth it.

review/summary: basic kit, decent for beginners, but very baseline
review/text: This is a pretty basic kit, and fine for beginners, but the items aren't the best quality. Personally, I'd opt for something better at the same price from sushinut which is where I get my sushi grade fish anyway. Sushi kits are always better when some thought was put into it, this is just one brand's stuff, for better or worse, but I'd opt for better quality for myself and my friends.

review/summary: One of the best birthday gifts ever!
review/text: Birthday presents for a 13 year old girl can be difficult.  You can't buy them clothes, because they will probably hate them, the gadget they do want is way too expensive, and cash is just not personal enough.  This gift was a life saver!  For less than $50.00, it was a personal, "cool" gift that everyone was ecstatic about!  Thank you Amazon for suggesting this!  We love it :)

review/summary: Sushi Making for beginners!!
review/text: I love Sushi and especially california rolls. Everytime I buy it,<br />I get upset for paying so much for it. So I decided, thats it time I try preparing it. Guess what?I enjoy making it! This kit comes with EVERYTHING you need to learn how to prepare it. If you master the rice preparation, then you got it made. I love the<br />little cook book. Its more like a instruction booklet. Its great.<br />Thats all you need really. I have made the california rolls two<br />weekends in a row. I will go on to sushi making, once I master this. I still need practice in rolling it, using the mat that came with the kit.<br />I highly recommend this Kit to those who are just beginning to learn how to prepare it. You will spend more, if you go looking for all the ingredients. This Kit has it all!!!And Guess what?Its sooooo much cheaper than in the restaurant!!

review/summary: Great starter kit
review/text: This was a xmas gift for a cook that recently started enjoying sushi. Like the description says, it does contain everything needed to get started. The book is a bit small, but not bad.<br /><br />It's an impressive box, she thought I spent at least $75 on the kit.<br /><br />Only thing that would have been nice is real wasabi, but it's understandable as it doesn't have a long shelf life.<br /><br />I complemented the kit with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/962593460X">Sushi (Essential Kitchen Series)</a> which was great and I definitely recommend.

review/text: Got this as a gift for my daughter and she was so thrilled to get it. It seems to have everything except the fresh ingredients to make sushi. The recipe book was good, I think once she gets the hang of making the rolls she'll need a better cookbook, but I think it was good for the beginner.

review/text: I received this kit for christmas and we just made the sushi tonight and it was fun kit to make simple sushi.  The book could be better, had a watch a few videos on the net to see how to do actually roll the sushi.  You need access to a good asia market to get some of the ingredients, but one you get the correct ingredients you will have some fun making sushi!

review/summary: Everything i wanted
review/text: I love sushi n thought it would be fun to start making it on my own. I looked @ all the other options that specifically came w/ the traditional bamboo roller, n I finally decided to go w/ this one. The packaging is nice n it has everything I need. The recipe book isn't exactly well rounded n has only a few recipes like the California roll, but I was willing to look past it considering there's so many resources out there where I can get what I'm looking for. I recommend this to anyone who's looking to start making sushi in a traditional way.

review/text: Great starter kit for beginners. Could've easily had bought higher quality ingredients and tools on my own for less than what the kit costs. The ingredients seem low quality, But it's ok for someone like me who is learning and just starting to make sushi. This kit could be better though.

review/text: This kit really does include everything you need to go from never making sushi to being confident.<br /><br />The book, along with a few youtube videos, are the only training I got in how to make sushi and it has been an enjoyable process.  We have used all the ingredients by now, but still use the mat, spoon and book to refer back to from time to time.<br /><br />Great set
