review/summary: SKEPTICAL
review/text: This product was first purchased where I took my dog for grooming.My groomer said her dogs just love them and they are all natural which I thought was great. Found same product on Amazon so purchased it on line. My dog loved them and was given one a day before I became aware they were made in China.  There has not been any health problems of any kind with my little dog,which I am thankful for but I am not sure if the product is to be trusted only because that is where the tainted dog food was made. The groomers dogs have them a few times aday and they are just fine, happy,and healthy dogs. It would be up to the purchaser if they wanted to buy them for their pet.

review/summary: Moldy
review/text: I have been buying a different brand of this treat for my dog and she just loves them and they are a much better treat than just a plain biscuit. I purchased 4 containers, 2 chicken and 2 duck with yams. No more than 2 days later they were moldy. When I contacted the company explained they knew it was a problem and have changed the ingredients to prevent the mold as it could cause upset stomachs in dogs consuming them. When I asked them to replace what they knew was a dangerous product, I was told to take it up with the seller. Not very friendly as they are responsible for the "known" problem treats.I did contact the seller to explain they had a potential problem and the were more than nice and sent me 4 new jars.....hopefully the good kind. ;-)

review/summary: Dogs love them as apparently sisters do too.
review/text: All thee of my dogs love these things, which is a pretty good endorsement as to likeability as all three are rather spoiled and rather picky.  It is a good thing to throw veggies into a dogs diet but at times it is rather difficult to get them to eat (much like children, I dare say).  I use these as special treats and always have some packed in my vest pocket for when we go on walks.  As a side note, I had some setting on the cabinet not long ago, out of the jar when my not overly bright sister came over for one of her unannounced "inspection" visits.  She popped on in her mouth and commented "yummy."  Never did tell her the truth.  Wonder if I could use it to house break her?  The only qualms I have about these things is that they apparently made in China.  I have some real fears about that.

review/text: This product is made in China.  I am concerned about the quality of the product, even though all the dogs I use to give them to love them.  There has been problems with dogs dying, becoming extremely ill (read about chicken products from China on the Internet).  I love our dog, and he doesn't need any additional problems, so I am going to discontinue giving them to him.  We need to start reading the labels on where things are made.  Buy products that are made in the USA!!!

review/text: I've got both hands and 9 of 10 fingers on the pulse of my mutt, as I'm sure most people reading this do. One must assume that a person reading reviews on dog treats loves their buddy.  I've tried a few varieties of duck, chick, beef, wrapped around sweet potato and the result has not varied,,,, ever,,, till now.  It was one short sniff for "product verification" and then "Let the attack begin."  I saved this type of product for the super treat.  However this brand was met with my mutt's suspicious snout, followed by nose nudges and paw swiping.  Finally, unless my mutt is real hungry, the treat was abandoned.  I can smell, feel and yesss, taste the difference.  Inferior food product!!!

review/text: Just a word of warning before you buy these.  Yes, they say they are "all natural", but the big deal-breaker is that they are MADE IN CHINA.  There were articles in the news recently (May/June) that linked several dog deaths around the U.S. to treats made in China.  I am not claiming that this particular product is one of the ones that contain these harmful chemicals & toxins, but how many times do we have to get burned by Chinese (food & grocery) products before we learn our lesson?<br /><br />Purchase at your - and your dog's - own risk.

review/text: If you don't mind the inevitable increased cancer risk and/or poisoning from these Chinese-manufactured dog products, then these might work for you.  But if you care about your dog, you would do well to avoid ANY edible dog product made in China, period.  There should be a large warning label for Chinese pet products.  It's full of chemical additives that will slowly kill your pets.  Please google this and find out the facts.

review/text: My dog loves this treat, and from what I can tell, this is real chicken wrapped in sweet potato. I did not give it 5 stars because the picture is deceiving, the bottom of the container has a "hump" that takes up a lot of space which is hard to tell (the picture looks like you are getting a complete container), so expect to get about a 1/4 less than you think.

review/text: My Shiba Inu loves these treats -- however, I've noticed these vary from batch to batch -- sometimes the sweet potato and chicken seem fresher while with other orders, that hasn't been the case although the treats are still safe to eat -- e.g., the natural sugars from the sweet potatoes has crystallized, resulting in a white coating -- my dog doesn't seem to care and he looks forward every morning to his treat -- it seems that the lower the price, the product might be a little older but each container is emptied way before its' expiration date!

review/text: This seller provides swift service.  I have ordered the dog treats twice---the last time, I ordered four pounds so I will have tons on hand.  Chablis, my little Chines crested, is crazy about these treats, and, because she's is inordinately "picky" about what she ingests, I practically shriek when I find something she enjoys eating.  Of course, I watch her while she feasts on the wrap, and she doesn't really eat the sweet potato part, but she practically swoons with joy when they appear.  I give her two a day, and she gnaws away--good tooth work---and I figure she gets some sweet potato along with the chicken.  I like the fact that the treats aren't huge, that she plays with them, and feels like she's been indulged.  Absolutely a good purchase for me.

No more worries now because these are delivered in plastic bags like so many other products, well sealed. The product is awesome!!! Thank you. Laura F.

review/summary: Quality and My Pooch Luvs It
review/text: I have the fussiest pooch you can imagine. She's a very pampered little bichon that's 9 lbs soaking wet. She will have nothing to do with any of the holistic varieties of canned dog food and she didn't really eat some of the other holistic dry types I bought. Although she really seemed to like the Ultra, I shopped around for other AAFCO approved holistic brands for her to try so she might have some variety. Each time I put half a portion of Ultra in her dish and half a portion of another variety, Ultra was still the favorite, leaving Buffalo Blue and others in the dust. The pieces are small enough for her dainty little mouth and although there is no variety of flavors, she doesn't seem to care. Of course, a little chicken or cheese helps, too. I've also done some research on the types of ingredients to look for as well as the ones to avoid and I'm quite satisfied that this is a quality, holistic product.

review/summary: Too Plain and Way Too Perfumed
review/text: ***<br />This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.<br />***

review/summary: DeBoles Pasta and Cheese
review/text: This gluten free version of Mac n Cheese is decent. However, Annie's is superior. The pasta's texture is grainy and doesn't cook up properly even when directions are followed precisely. The cheese powder is not colored, so the sauce covering the noodles looks like white glue over cardboard. The taste is good, though. For the price, I will order it again. The minor issues are not enough to make me not like it or not want to re-order it.

review/summary: LOVE this pasta and cheese!
review/text: I've recently been diagnosed with celiac disease, and the first time I tried this mac and cheese I hated it. I agree, it tasted like cardboard. But after just three weeks of being gluten free, and becoming more accustomed to the taste of rice noodles vs. wheat noodles, I now absolutely adore this! It's the best mac and cheese I've ever tasted. De Boles gluten free products have played a huge role in how easily I've been able to give up my favorite wheat-y foods. This is a high calorie meal but I have to stop myself from eating an entire box. If you try this, give yourself awhile to acquire a taste for it - it's been worth it for me. I'm not a big fan of Annie's gluten free (or regular) mac and cheese, but I LOVE this!

review/summary: Light Mac n Cheese
review/text: Long before my youngest son was Dx'd with Celiac Disease, my two boys never liked the 'orange' Mac n' cheese and always preferred the white.  For whatever reason they prefer the lighter milder flavor.  When I started looking for rice mac n cheese, we tried the Annies and one other flavor and they didn't like it.  I finally found the Deboles and they have been happily eating it for several years now.

review/summary: Great texture and flavor
review/text: This is the best gluten-free macaroni and cheese I've found. The texture of the rice noodles is more consistent to standard pasta and doesn't get starchy. I've tried Annie's and Trader Joes and both get a sticky starchy texture which I really don't prefer and the noodles get huge. De Boles stays as a smaller noodle and with the 8-10 minute cooking time makes an al dente pasta that I really enjoyed.

review/summary: KID & parent approved!
review/text: I was told end of Jan, that my 6yo son needed to follow a gluten free diet and we've tried both Annies & Deboles - I have a lot more luck finding Deboles brand pasta locally, and I even love this mac n cheese!! I prefer this one to Annies actually. He loves it, and also took right to the corn spaghetti, I recommend trying a box locally and try it again. I think it takes trying it at least twice to really decide if it has grown on you. I also cook the noodles about 10-12min instead of the 8-10 recommended - we are not aldente' people. We like our noodles a bit mooshy..

review/text: We bought this months ago, but it sat in the pantry because our pasta experiences have been rather gross. My daughter finally talked me into giving it a try...I like it so much better than the old Kraft Mac & Cheese! This has a great cheese flavor without the plastic aftertaste. I followed the directions exactly (6 minutes was perfect), and was happily surprised. The texture and flavor of the pasta was excellent. I'm going to use it as a base for GF tuna casserole.

review/summary: Edible, but not as good as Annie's
review/text: This Mac & Cheese product is passable, but not what I would call "good." The best part is that the noodles don't fall apart too much (although I suppose if you overcooked it, it would -- like all rice pastas). But the texture and flavor were both very blah. The color is also unappetizing, if that matters to you. Note to DeBoles -- If you must use a brown pasta, you might consider compromising a bit and using a little yellow food coloring in the sauce. Brown Mac & Cheese really just doesn't look yummy. After trying it, I added a can of tuna fish and that made it ok. I'm glad I bought one box at the store to try instead of a case from Amazon. It's worth the extra money to buy the Annie's Rice Mac & Cheese product instead. Annie's is MUCH better.

I purchased a tagine( my first) and when i received this product i knew i had made the right decision!!!  The recipe on the back of the package made my mouth water.

review/summary: Tart and tempting...
review/text: Sumac is not in every kitchen cupboard, but it should be.  A lot like lemon, tart and astringent, but somehow moreso, it brings out other flavors and enhances them. Makes them more intense.  Sprinkle equal parts sumac, thyme and salt (the blend is called zaatar and used a lot in middle eastern cooking) on chicken before roasting and broiling and it brings out all the chicken flavor with just a hint of tanginess.<br /><br />One half a teaspoon sprinkled on scrambled eggs lifts them out of the category of breakfast standby and into a completely new echelon.  The pairing of smoked fish (lox or salmon, whitefish, sable or, especially, sturgeon) with sumac-enhanced scrambled eggs does things to the inside of the mouth that are probably illegal in some Red States.<br /><br />Run of the mill red caviar can be mixed with sour cream, a tiny amount of finely chopped chives and a big hit of sumac, then spread on a halved fingerling potatoes that have been sliced in half, drizzled with lots of olive oil and oven roasted until they have a good, crunchy crust. It's a combination of flavors and textures that's explodes with bright flavor. If you can never get too much salt, scatter some crisp bacon on top.  It's really salty, but really delicious.<br /><br />Any food that benefits from a squirt of lemon will be better with a little sumac.  Even lemonade is improved, especially if your lemons are dull and you want a really tart beverage.  Melt 1/2 cup sugar in hot water, pour it into a big pitcher. Add one teaspoon sumac, 1/4 tsp vanilla (super secret ingredient, tell no one), the juice of 4 lemons (don't squeeze too hard, you don't want sour oils from the skin ruining the taste), and enough filtered walter to fill up the pitcher. Chill and you have the iconic summer afternoon drink.<br /><br />Sumac is perfect with fish.  Sumac and ginger rubbed onto any white fish bring out the sweetness...this is especially lovely on catfish or those new fish like tilapia that have started appearing in the markets as the really good fish disappear or become too expensive.  Sumac and garlic are a brawnier pairing, good with fish, great with vegetables.  Sautee broccoli or spinach in olive oil with garlic, then sprinkle with sumac. Even veggie haters will think twice before saying no.  And added to home fries, sumac transforms diner food into something you'll want to serve with an expensive steak.  You can also rub sumac on steak to brighten the taste or add it to your usual dry rub or marinade.  And try it in chicken soup.  Just trust me on that one...you will want to throw a parade for me after tasting.  Experiment. Keep some in a dish on the table and sprinkle wherever you might have added lemon...on salads, in salad dressings for more that sharp lemony taste but less acid.<br /><br />If you need a quick lunch, salad or appetizer, this is a fast and easy go-to dish that takes five minutes to make and will please even people who (like me) consider salads more decorative than edible.  And if someone you invite to dinner sits down at the table and drops the bomb: "But didn't you know I'm a vegan?" you can dash to the kitchen and have it ready to slide under that persnicity little snoot in two minutes.<br /><br />Spiced Tomatoes on Exotic Bread<br />2 Tablespoons dried thyme<br />1 Tablespoon sumac<br />2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted<br />1/2 teaspoon table salt<br />1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (or regular if you don't have the little ones. Why sweat the small stuff)<br /><br />In a small container with a lid, shake together the zaatar...thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt. If you don't have sesame seeds, it's okay. It will still taste good, just not as good.  The combination, with or without the seeds is called 'zaatar,' which is Arabic for "Can I have some more, please."<br /><br />Cut each of the cherry tomatoes in half (if using whole tomatoes, dice them and let a little of the juice drain away, you don't want this too liquidy), sprinkle with about one tablespoon of the zaatar.  Stir it all together, then taste. You don't want it too salty.  Add more zaatar if necessary, tasting as you go.  The tomatoes will make this very juicy. Serve with lots of toasted naan, pita, lavash, or any middle eastern flatbread that's fun to dip/sop.  I've served it with corn tortillas and it was good. I think it would be great with toasted french bread or garlic bread.  It is so good, you forget it's made of vegetables.<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute: I forgot tunafish.  One can of tuna, one tablespoon each mayo and plain yogurt (please, not that scary plastic looking non fat stuff, use the real thing). One big tablespoon of sumac. Stir lightly so the tuna stays lumpy. Pile it on top of toasted rye bread or a rye krisp, open-faced, and scatter chives on top.  It's just tuna, takes no more time than the same old same old, but it tastes much better, plus it's festive.<br /><br />Enjoy.

review/text: I'd heard about how great this stuff was supposed to be. Followed the recipe on the bag--the whole nine yards.<br /><br />Eh.<br /><br />Even less than eh.<br /><br />I tried it alone on roast chicken and mixed with other stuff--it just had no flavor. I mean, NONE. "Lemony" my *ss. I've roasted chicken with just salt, pepper, and a little butter, and it had WAY more flavor than this.<br /><br />I can't help wondering: what do people who eat this and RAVE (and those raves were why I searched it out and bought it) eat normally? ROCKS?<br /><br />No, rocks MIGHT have some flavor. Sand, then?<br /><br />Look, if you've got some recipes that make the most of this spice, I might try them and update this review. I love finding new flavors or flavor combos. But unless you can put your money where your mouth is with a recipe that will convince me--don't bother. And don't waste my time whining about how this spice is 'misunderstood' by me. Put your moaning where your mouth is.<br /><br />If you can post a great recipe using this stuff, then I'll update this review. If not, don't whine about how I don't get it, or whatever. It's either good, or it's NOT. Right now, I'm saying NOT.<br /><br />The company does give you a lot of it for your money--but if it has no flavor, who cares?

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.

review/summary: A coffe soda that actually works
review/text: I'm a big critic of soda health-wise, but every so often I endulge in this guilty pleasure.<br /><br />I've had several different coffee sodas from china and asia, and they all were horrible.<br /><br />This is the only coffee soda I've had which tastes good... in fact, it tastes better than most sodas.<br /><br />It's made with real sugar, not high-fructose corn syrup, so it's a bit healthier and has a crisp taste.<br />The expresso content is quite high, so you can expect a nice buzz, just as if you drinking a real expresso. The foam can leave an aftertaste in your mouth. The combination of expresso and sugar is quite potent. I usually don't drink the entire bottle at once.<br /><br />If you live near NYC you can buy it quite cheap, (inculding at meatfarms supermarkets on Long Island).

review/summary: The Best Bar on the Market Hands Down
review/text: Going on Weight Watchers has its challenges. I have lost about 40 lbs to date and it has been good but I find that many of the products recommended by them have too much sugar. For example, everyone suggested Fiber One Bars as a snack because they are low in points. I noticed though that they spiked my blood sugar and stalled my weight loss. I switched to Extend Bars and boy, what a difference! I eat one of these every day, some times two. I really like them before bed or in the morning to help stabilize my blood sugar (I am hypoglycemic, pre-diabetic). I never have trouble eating breakfast now, these with a glass of skim milk or coffee and milk and a piece of fruit and I am good to go until lunch.<br /><br />What is the difference between Extend Bars and the rest on the market? First, they are only a 150 calories with only 3 grams of fat but 11 grams of protein per bar. They also have 5 grams of fiber, just enough to help digestion, without causing stomach discomfort. (Something I can not say about some of the others on the market!)<br /><br />I can not find another bar on the market to match those protein and fiber stats for the little calories and fat exchange. Also, the glycemic index is low because this bar contains a special slow digesting corn starch created from a corn grain that is different than the normal variety. It does not allow the blood sugar to spike, which can stall weight loss. This is the number one selling point for me, high protein and low glycemic...<br /><br />Finally because I really believe we eat WAY too many processed carbs in our diet, this satisfied me in another area, it has a low net carb ratio, and does it WITHOUT the use of high levels of sugar alcohol. There are only 4 grams of sugar alcohol per bar, that is completely different than any other low carb bar on the market.<br /><br />I really like the Chocolate and Peanut Butter, but not too wild about the berry and apple ones though. These taste exactly like the South Beach Cereal Bars, just less sweet. Give them a chance, they are not going to be as sweet as other things on the market...but they are great with coffee or milk...helps them not be too dry. Be sure to drink plenty of water as will any high fiber bar.

review/text: These were recommended in the class I took when 1st Dxed with diabetes. They work well whenever you don't want to eat more (dieting), or when you won't eat for hours; that includes overnight to help avoid high sugar levels when you wake. In fact, they're very good at helping me get a full night's sleep, uninterrupted by waking up to eat a snack.

review/summary: Stabilizes overnight blood sugar
review/text: My 9-year-old daughter has Type 1 diabetes and we could not find a bedtime snack that stabilized her overnight blood sugar - until her diabetes educator recommended the Extend Bar. It REALLY does what it claims to do - stops blood sugar from going too low overnight. Now my daughter does not have to eat a glucose tablet in the middle of the night to keep from going too low. Her morning headaches and shakiness are gone! If her bedtime blood sugar is 120, her fasting blood sugar is usually around 100. The bars do not cause a sharp spike in blood sugar, just as advertized. Although they don't taste like real granola bars (not as sweet or moist), all the peanut and chocolate varieties are tasty enough to satisfy a picky 9-year-old. Thank you, Extend Bar!<br /><br />UPDATE 12/2/2010:<br /><br />We tried all varieties of Extend Bar except the Mixed Berry. The "Delight" varieties work the best at stabilizing the blood sugar of a Type 1 diabetic, since they contain only 20-21 carbs, no sugar, and 4-6 grams of sugar alcohol:<br /><br />Chocolate Delight<br />Chocolate Peanut Delight<br />Peanut Delight<br /><br />The "Crunch" varieties contain 30 carbs, 10 grams sugar (!), and 5 grams of sugar alcohol - and they caused my diabetic daughter's blood sugar to spike overnight. I don't understand why the manufacturer included so much sugar! These are not a good choice for a Type 1 diabetic, although they might work for a mild Type II diabetic who still manufactures insulin:<br /><br />Chocolate Crunch<br />Peanut Butter Crunch<br /><br />No one liked the taste of the Apple Cinnamon variety.

review/summary: Hypoglycemic's savior!
review/text: I'm a group exercise instructor who suffers from frequent and severe low blood sugar.  I've been through all sorts of different bars and these are hands down THE BEST.  They taste great, have 6g of dietary fiber and 11g of protein, low in fat....chocolate tastes exactly like a Crunch bar.<br /><br />I noticed a difference in my blood sugar stability the first morning I had one.  I usually can't go without eating something for more than an hour and a half, but these carried me about 3 hours before I realized I needed to eat again.  That says a LOT!  I'm not even going to try the 9 hour claim it makes, but that's just me.<br /><br />LOVE THEM and I'll cry if they ever discontinue them!!

review/summary: Seriously Good Diabetic Friendly Bar - Highly Recommended!
review/text: The Extend "Chocolate Delight" bars are probably the best low carb snack bars I have tried since becoming diabetic. While the Atkins bars are generally very good, these taste even better and also do seem to control my blood sugar longer.<br /><br />These bars have 150 Calories each, 12g of Protein, and only 1 Net Carb. The high protein load really helps to control my hunger,  making this a great snack for mid-day munchies or after workout "pick me up", as well as a bed time snack.<br /><br />One note of caution, these do have Maltitol which can cause "gastric distress" in some people.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/summary: Healthy and Hearty
review/text: I am always looking for healthy snack foods.  What I usually find are great tasting snacks that are too high in sugar, low in protein, and low in fiber.  They are good for camping or taking long hikes, but not for a daily healthy snack.<br /><br />ExtendBar Chocolate Delight meets my requirements.  This snack has 12 g of protein, 0 sugar (4 g of "sugar alcohol"), and 0 cholesterol.  "ExtendBar's" 20 g of carbohydrates is uncooked cornstarch, which is designed to be slowly processed in digestion.<br /><br />The taste is not the best I have ever eaten, but it is palatable.  It is not sweet, nor tart.  It reminds me of dark chocolate, but certainly not milk chocolate.  The bar's taste is more than acceptable.<br /><br />The Extendbar Chocolate Delight is valuable.  This is one of the best items for overall health that I have seen on the market. It is low in sodium and sugar (no high fructose corn syrup), and gluten free.  On the other hand, high in protein (12g), good fiber (6 g), and sustained energy level.  All this good nutrition and only 150 calories.  .<br /><br />The sustained energy level is real.  I have tried this for awhile without blood sugar spikes and without low blood sugar (amazing how they do it, but they do).  I highly recommend this product.

review/summary: For weight loss and blood sugar control
review/text: I was diagnosed with type 2 six months back. Decided to lose weight and cut carbs (no sugar, potato, pasta, rice or bread 95% of the time, sometimes I cheat :) ) in order to get in control. Been using extend bars since. I have one for breakfast with coffee. Then for lunch I have another one, sometimes I have a salad instead, or with. The key is that they really seem to work well to suppress my appetite, probably because they stabilize my blood sugar. Anyway after six months I'm down 25 Ibs without really starving and my blood sugar level have improved significantly, my doctor was very happy and told me I will not need any Meds if I keep this up.<br />I plan to lose another 25 with the help of the extend bars.<br />So I recommend these. Just note that some bars have more sugar. I only use the ones without.<br />Note that I also do a bunch of other stuff nutritionally to lose weight and control blood sugar so this is one piece of the puzzle, but a big one.<br />One thing I have NOT done is exercise. Not one bit. Not proud of it but happy that I can lose weight and improve blood sugar levels anyway. No doubt I would do even better with exercise.

review/summary: Good
review/text: This bar tastes pretty good, but it's not delicious. The nice thing is that there is a lot of chewing involved, and it takes several minutes to eat, which makes it a more satisfying food experience. I eat mine before bed with 8 ounces of water. My blood sugar is now a little better in the morning. I am on insulin at bedtime, so this gives me peace of mind that my sugar will be more or less stable throughout the night. My blood sugar in the morning is about 5% or 10% better than with just eating a small bowl of unsweetened yogurt at bedtime. (If I don't eat anything at bedtime, my sugars are worse in the morning.) The bad thing about this bar is that I always get a funny aftertaste from Splenda. But it's before bedtime and I just brush my teeth and just go to sleep and it's manageable. I enjoyed the crunchy texture of the Chocolate Delight bar. I have ordered these through Amazon Subscribe & Save Program and got a discount, which is a good thing.

review/summary: "Dreambar" for Diabetics & WeightWatchers
review/text: At last!! A yummy sweet for diabetics, weight watchers and even ordinary guys. The name Extendbar truly doesn't do this "dreambar" justice.  Most sugar-free, diatetic foods taste like the boxes they come in and often don't live-up to the health requirements we need. Most are more pricey than their regular counterparts but not this "sweetie".<br /><br />My favorite is the Peanut Butter Chocolate Delight...a lusciously light flavor reminiscent of quality chocolate surrounding peanuts and crispies designed to stave off between meal munchies or replace a meal and makes the perfect delicious bedtime snack to maintain glucose levels for up to nine hours. These bars taste so good, I feel like I'm cheating on my food plan. I found that nibbling the bar encourages a more satisfied feeling and prolongs the pleasant experience of eating something yummy without the guilt or fear of high sugar levels. Other scrumptious flavors include Mixed Berry, Apple Cinnamon, Peanut and Chocolate Delights. I've shared ExtendBars with my doctors, friends and even strangers who ask me what I'm eating and want to know how to purchase them.<br /><br />A light treat just added is ExtendCrisp;available in Cinnamon, White Cheddar, Honey BBQ, Italian Herb and Zesty Ranch, all designed as sweet and savory snacks that aid you in controlling your glucose levels and calorie intake while chasing away those blues about dieting and maintaining good health.  Purchased by the box they are reasonably priced, don't wait...enjoy an Extend "Dreambar" today.

review/summary: Sweet, rich, fragrant tea
review/text: This is a tea based on rooibos (red bush), a plant native to South Africa. The leaves are like little needles, rather like cedar shavings, and the flavor is naturally sweet and a bit aromatic, like vanilla or nuts but not exactly.<br /><br />The tea is supposed to have a lot of antioxidants and when adding the dried blueberries, the aroma is absolutely delightful and the taste is naturally sweet and appealing. There is not even a hint of bitterness. Rooibos lends itself to a lot of flavor additives such as vanilla, chocolate, fruit, rum and spice but blueberry has to be my favorite way to enjoy it. If you are looking to cut down on caffeine and want a good hot beverage, try this one.

review/summary: Made me love loose leaf
review/text: I've been drinking bag teas for a decade and this Rishi was the first loose leaf I'd had.  I love how fragrant and fruity this is, and the diuretic effect.

review/summary: Smells divine
review/text: This stuff smells so wonderful in the tin and after being steeped.  The flavor is a subtle fruit blend and it is good but somehow I feel let down because the flavor doesn't stack up to the smell.  It's a pleasant drink that is good cold or warm.

review/summary: Outstanding blueberry tea
review/text: This tea is so wonderfully fragrant that I could smell it even before I opened the shipping box. My whole house smelled like a blueberry field.  It was great! It has a very nice, slightly tart, blueberry taste.  It makes wonderful iced tea on a hot summer day. Really, it's the most thirst quenching thing.  A little lemon also adds to the flavor.  Because this is loose-leaf tea, it isn't as convenient as individual bags, but I make a big, concentrated batch and keep it in a pitcher in the fridge and it works just as well.  Love it!

review/summary: Good
review/text: Is is a nice tea, and with whole blueberries its awesome. I give it three stars though, because the flavor isnt really as bold or sweet as i was hoping for. Its a little bland, but very good quality! Also, it has lots of tiny little pieces that are hard to filter out...

review/summary: Check before buying
review/text: I bought a jar of pimentos yesterday, opened it in the afternoon to add to a recipe, & found a large disgusting growth of something in it.  I've no idea what it was, but looked like the mushrooms that sometimes pop up in my yard.  Whatever it was totally grossed me out & I will never be able to buy, or eat, another pimento.  I returned the jar last evening, & the grocery was also shocked.  The other jars on their shelf were fine.  My advice is to carefully check pimentos, & anything else you purchase in a glass jar, where you can see the contents.
