review/summary: Weak uneventful coffee
review/text: This Green Mountain French Vanilla Decaf is weak coffee and lacks the taste of other French Vanilla coffee. The best I could do with this is brew it at a 6-oz cup to give it some flavor. I cannot wait until it's gone and I can try another decaf. Don't settle for this coffee when you have other choices available.

review/summary: Love This Decaf Coffee
review/text: I have a single cup Keurig coffee machine. I can't have caffenine and I love the French Vanilla Flavor of coffee. I've tried several other K-cups of different French Vanilla and didn't like the taste of any of them. I ended up tossing them all in the trash. When I tried this Green Mountain French Vanilla in K-cups that is Decaf, I can't seem to get enough of it. There's no after taste, which is wonderful. What I do, is make this coffee during the evening (when I crave it the most) and add some cinnamon and stir. Then I add some International French Vanilla Cream for sweetness to my liking, and then add Fat Free milk to finish it off. The flavor for me is absolutely Heaven! Even drinking it in the evening, it doesn't keep me up all night, and when I go to bed, I sleep like a baby and get a good nites rest. I won't be changing to any other brand or flavor. This tastes so incredable! It's just as described being luschously rich and smooth. It's also a Light Roast, so It's perfect for me and I can add any extra flavors (like the cinnamon) I mentioned. I Very higly Recommend this for anyone, especially ones that can't have the caffine! And the price is very reasonable! Love it, Love it, Love it!!!

review/text: Seems difficult to find decaffeinated French Vanilla coffee in the K-Cups.  I guess most people want their caffeine.  I personally find all the K-Cups to be too expensive but I suppose you're paying for the convenience.  Green Mountain has a good vanilla taste at an average k-cup price (around 65 cents/cup).

review/summary: Wow! Incredible product!
review/text: If you bake for someone who is gluten intolerant and get a little discouraged with the "gritty" consistency of your baking, you must try this flour! I received mine today and mixed up a batch of Wendy Wark's GF flour blend, using the superfine brown rice flour for both the brown and white rice flour called for in the recipe. I then made a batch of chocolate chip cookies. Let me first say, I am a gluten eater, my husband is the one that needs to eat GF. So I have had wheat based homemade cookies very recently. I have been trying new GF recipes for him during the 2 years since his diagnosis, trying to get as close to what he was used to as possible. This is the first time that even the raw cookie dough tasted like wheat based CC cookie dough!<br /><br />The cookies baked up beautifully and looked like regular. The taste and "mouth feel" was nothing short of miraculous. These did not elicit a response of "they're fine" but rather, "These are great!" When my kids came home from school, they saw cookies and had a couple. When I told them they were GF and I had made them for Daddy, they didn't believe me. I think I will have to make some more very soon as the ones I made today are almost all gone, thanks to my husband and the kids!<br /><br />I now have a flour that has given me that "perfect" GF CC cookie recipe to file alongside the "perfect" GF brownie recipe and the "perfect" GF pizza recipe. Maybe I will have to tackle bagels next? I only hope a store near me starts to carry this or I will go broke on S&H! But I will gladly pay the S&H to have this product available to me! I can't wait to try it in other recipes.

review/text: Say bye bye to gritty GF flour!  I bought Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour based on the suggestion from a stellar book called Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts.  Her recipes call for a blend of Brown rice flour, Potato Starch(not flour), and Tapioca flour and all my recipes come out perfectly.  I supplied all the desserts for Easter and everyone raved about how GF baked goods are better that the original.  Well they hadn't tasted the trial and errors of previous mixes and flours.  So buy Authentic Foods Superfine Brown Rice Flour and The Gluten Free Baking Classics by Annalise Roberts and no one will ever know you've baked GF unless you tell them.  P. S. I even received a call from my "Simon Cowell" friend the next day saying he couldn't stop eating the left-overs.

review/text: I also bought this flour based on a recomendation from the book Gluten Free Baking Basics, which i bought from this site (and love!).  It is true that this rice flour is the best quality rice flour I've used yet - however, for me the shipping cost as much as the flour, which i found hard to live with.  You can get white rice flour at an asian market, much cheaper, and also a fine ground.  However, the texture when using the asian white rice flour is a bit gummier - this brown rice flour has a much better texture.  I'm only rating at 4 stars due to the craziness of having to ship flour.

There is no substitute.  I make the lemon bars all the time - they are constantly requested by my non gf family.  You don't need this flour if you make the breads from GFBC, only the sweets, but who wants to go through life without the sweets? There is little difference between buying it from Amazon and buying it directly from Authentic Foods - I think Authentic Foods direct was a few pennies cheaper.  Suck it up, count the shipping as part of the cost of the flour, swallow hard, and never look back...

If you can find them for a good deal, don't hesitate to scoop it up!

The combination of sea salt and garlic compliments just about every food we prepare. As the label says, it is "Great on chicken, steak, burgers, fish, pasta, soups, eggs and vegetables." It also rocks in soups, dips, some salads and sauces too. The convenience of having these two indispensable spices in one package saves time in the long run as well. The plastic mill is easy to use; just give it a few shakes, remove the cap and grind away. Ours lasts us up to six months. If you live in a humid climate like I do, the contents can start to stick a little, but I find a few sharp taps on the counter and some vigorous shaking loosens things right up.<br /><br />Salt and garlic lovers, look no further!

review/summary: Love it!!!
review/text: Every since Costco had the Garlic Sea Salt Grinders a few years ago we have been looking for something similar.  We wanted to buy a large grinder and most of what are offered on the market are small containers.  We were very glad to find the large Olde Thompson Garlic Sea Salt Grinder,  and even more happy that they were sold in two-packs and were very reasonably priced.  The flavor is very good.  We are very pleased with the product.

I used the container to hold a DVD, a package of popcorn, and 2 packs of hot chocolate. I wrapped it all up with cellophane and a bow. It was beautiful! And they can use the container for their popcorn. I was very happy with the product for the price.

review/text: I've fed these to quite a few wheat-eaters, and they see no difference between these and other cookies.  I have tossed in various combinations of nuts, dried blueberries, chocolate chips, and coconut and cooked them as bar cookies.  Everyone loves them.  They disappear within 24 hours of baking.<br /><br />Namaste makes the BEST GLUTEN FREE FOOD on the market that I've found.  If I had to suggest some food products to someone who was starting the transition from a diet including wheat to a wheat-free diet, I'd recommend Namaste's products.  I've never had a bad product from them.  Try also their pizza crust, spice cake mix, and chocolate cake.  It's all fantastic.

review/text: My 23 month old son was put on a no egg, casein, gluten...everything else diet so we can get a clear idea of what he is allergic too.  For those with young ones who are on a similar diet either by necessity or choice know that they can be extremely picky eaters.  I purchased this mix from a health food store just to try it out.  It saved my son's first attended birthday party!  He was perfectly content and didn't pay attention to the fact that others were eating birthday cake.  He loves it!  I put a powdered sugar, vanilla and rice milk glaze on it and cut it into small bites and he calls it candy!  I sincerely applaud the efforts of this company to allow all those who are free to enjoy special treats...especially the little guys!  Thank you so much!

review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Blondies
review/text: When I found out I had to go gluten free, the first thing that came to my mind was, "What about Blondies???"<br />My grandmother taught me how to make them 25 years ago. I couldn't imagine never eating them again and I didn't think it would be possible to reproduce them. On a whim, I bought a pack of Namaste Gluten-Free Blondie Mix at my local natural food store. I was delighted to see that one package makes either one 9x13 pan or 2 8x8 pans and that I didn't have to make both 8x8 pans at the same time. The minute I got home, I measured out the ingredients and in 30 minutes (plus cooling time) I had perfect blondies almost exactly like my Grandmother's. My husband loved them even more than Grandma's because they are a bit softer and more cake-like (due to using oil, not butter, I presume.)<br /><br />Two days later, he was asking for more blondies, so I poured the rest of the mix into a bowl and mixed them up. Total disaster. They were wet and under-cooked. I was pretty disappointed. I checked the package to make sure I added the right amount of egg, oil and water. Check. I also had originally scooped out the first batch's dry mix very loosely as the package indicated I should. But it was obvious that the ratio was off.<br />Back to the natural food store- bought two more packages! Today, I got out the digital food scale and weighed the mix. (Make sure you understand how to use the scale- you have to be sure that you are taking into account the weight of the container you are using.) I divided it exactly in half by weight, then measured them out again and was pretty confident I had an exact split. The batch just came out of the oven and is even more perfect than the original one. I am confident the next batch from the same bag will be perfect.<br /><br />***I added a scant 1/3 cup of very loose dark brown sugar to the mix both times (after weighing) because I knew it wouldn't be sweet enough for my husband. I also added a little extra bit of salt. The first batch I made, I added a splash of good vanilla extract to, but I forgot it this time. I also added 1/3 or so of a package of Ghiradelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate baking chips. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0005Z7SPU">Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips, 11.5 oz.</a><br /><br />Once I test out the second half of this mix successfully, I'll be ordering a case. I am confident I can maintain a gluten-free diet if I can have my favorite snack and these blondies fit the bill.

review/summary: Excellent Buy
review/text: This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.<br /><br />I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months.

review/summary: Nice, rich flavor
review/text: I normally go for medium roasts for espresso since I drink it straight, and the dark roasts tend to have a burnt undertone that can range from unpleasant to downright nasty. This roast from Coffee Bean Direct is the exception, however. The flavor is rich with smokey tones, but no (or very little) burned flavor. Excellent crema as well.<br /><br />While I can't say for sure since I don't like milk in my coffee, I imagine the flavor would stand up very well in a milk-based drink. I did try it as an Americano, and it was quite good. The flavors were toned down a bit as you would expect, but still came through nicely.<br /><br />I did have to fiddle with the grind level a bit to get a decent shot. The setting I use for medium roast beans nearly choked my espresso machine - took nearly 50 seconds for a double shot and, as you can imagine, was quite horrible. I had to go two full notches coarser on my Vario grinder to get a good shot. I expect this is due to the fact that the darker roast is much more oily than the medium roasts, and needs a coarser grind.<br /><br />I do wish it came in a smaller package so it would be easier to store and keep fresh. But, the five pound bag comes at an excellent per-pound price.<br /><br />Good beans at a good price. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Best tasting decaf I've had
review/text: This is no doubt the best tasting decaf coffee that I've had.  I stopped drinking caffeinated coffee last year and have found it difficult finding good tasting decaf.  (I also try to avoid chemically decaffeinated coffee.)  The selection of decaf coffees is somewhat limited, but more significantly, I find that most decafs just don't taste too good compared to full bodied caffeinated coffees.  This is my first taste of CO2 decaf - I'm not sure what role the process plays, but Coffee Bean Direct got it right.  This coffee is full bodied, rich and great tasting.  I would definitely buy it again.  I only wish it came in a smaller sized bag.

review/summary: My Favorite Instant Ramen
review/text: I'm a big fan of Japanese culture, especially the food. I found this flavor of instant ramen quite some time ago, but it's still one of my favorites. Back when I discovered it, I only bought one bowl to try and I was instantly hooked! But when I went back to the store to buy it again, they were out of stock, and when I tried looking for it online, it was no where to be found. I'm so excited that it's available online now! It has a great garlic and onion flavor with a delicious sesame aftertaste. It's not spicy at all, which is a great alternative to all those super hot ramen soups. Some people might be put off by some of the ingredients, (look up tonkotsu soup) but it has such an amazing flavor, that it doesn't matter. If you're into trying new things, like Japanese food and love great flavor, definitely try this one.

review/summary: Outstanding for instant ramen
review/text: I'll preface this review with the clarification that my five star rating is based on my opinions given the nature of the product- as a pre-packaged ramen. It's certainly no substitute for a "real" bowl of tonkotsu ramen. I'm a hardcore Sapporo-style ramen fan but the closest noodle shop with tonkotsu ramen is a bit out of my way and eating there requires some planning. Preparing the soup for homemade tonkotsu ramen is a long process that can take days, depending on the recipe, and I've never been motivated enough to finally try it myself from scratch because the time and effort is just too daunting for me. I dislike prepackaged ramen as a general rule, especially ramen of the "instant" variety that only needs the addition of boiling water and rehydration. I decided to give this product a shot since I've never had a prepackaged ramen that promised the flavor of a tonkotsu broth, which is rich and unctuous, and most instant ramen broths just resemble a clear bouillon. For a prepackaged instant ramen, I have to say that I'm really impressed with how well the flavors and texture of "real" tonkotsu broth are represented. No, I'd never mistake it for the real thing and if it were the real thing then I'd consider it below mediocre but for what it is, I consider it outstanding and I'll be re-ordering. Note: This is very salty (1680 mg sodium), heavy (21 g fat) and more caloric (410 calories) than most prepackaged ramen, which is already considered to be bad for you, but that's true of many "real" tonkotsu broths and as an occasional lunch while I'm at at work and stuck at my desk, I'm okay with that and adjust the rest of my foods that day accordingly. I wouldn't be willing to waste my sodium, fat or calorie budgets on any other instant ramen I've ever had.

review/text: **BEGIN UPDATE 9/08** Just received my 2nd case of 12 in a little over 3-wks, but then again I've been sharing, 1/3 for sharing w/my taste-buddies while the remaining 2/3's have been for my own taste-buds.  I added little steamed won-tons today but it was more than this soup needed, maybe tomorrow a sliced hard-boiled egg; keeping it simple is the best way to enjoy this bowl of ramen wherein the broth is superior. I will let you know if I ever get on to trying the other flavors as I'd originally hoped.  Thanks for reading. **END UPDATE**<br /><br />If you ever enjoyed add-hot water and wait bowl-type instant ramen, this has, in my humble opinion, the best tasting broth, no-contest of this type that I've ever had since "Cup Jorick" came along early 70's. Fast-forward, for the last year or so I've enjoyed the "Nong Shim Big Bowl Noodle Udon" (still do!) since it isn't SPICY at all, allowing me to add spice if I choose to change it up, add steamed won-tons, char siu - you get the idea.  "Menraku Tonkotsu Ramen" while the noodles are on par w/instant ramen of the bowl variety, here it's the RICH BROTH, that immediately upon tasting, is set apart from the usual within the category.  Other reviewers here who have also enjoyed have picked up the same flavorful aspects:  buttery, a bit of garlic, a rich-tasting broth like you could only get home-made or in the best kept secret asian restaurants.  I look forward to trying the other Menraku varieties:  Shio Ramen, Miso Ramen, and Shoyu Ramen, all very basic flavors that can be lost causes in the wrong hands but I am convinced on this experience alone, though "Tonkotsu" ramen may be my new, all-time favorite, that I will enjoy the others as well.  Wondered about "Tonkotsu"(pork-bone), not to be confused w/"tonkatsu"(breaded pork cutlet), as the broth didn't convey much pork taste though it could be usual Japanese subtlety at play here.  I got this on WED and I've had one each day since.  I should get another case soon as I know I'll be sharing.  Currently living in a dorm?  Buy the case. Stash it however you're best  able or split the case w/others. It's quick, easy and great value.  Amazon Prime got it here in two-days!!!  The only thing left to say is "Itadakimasu!"

review/summary: Bully Springs
review/text: These are excellent Bully Springs but one of them was too big for my small yorkie to chew so I gave it to the neighbors larger dog.  He was able to chew the skinnier one and he seemed to enjoy it.  I do wish that these came in skinnier, easy to chew for smaller dogs.  I never know when I place an order what I'm going to get.  I'm going to keep looking but I highly recommend for larger dogs.

review/summary: Good tea, but better in the satchel
review/text: I first had this tea in the satchel.  It is fantastic that way.  When I finished my firs tin I saw that it came in bags and a box as an option as well.  I ordered the fifty pack.  The bags are good and very convenient when I travel, but no match for the satchels in flavor.  If you like a touch of cinnamon, the bags are fine.  If you want a more robust taste, I recommend the satchel.

review/text: This tea is absolutely delicious and I love that it is sweet without any additional sugar! It is very spicy as well. The tea is great as-is or with a bit of milk. Unfortunately twice when I've had this tea, part of my face has become bright red, tight, and itchy. It goes down after 20 minutes or so. I must be allergic to something in the tea. Take a good look at the ingredients before buying!

review/summary: CINN-A-MON!  Second to NONE!
review/text: Now how can you add anything to the excellent reviews the excellent people here wrote?  (I feel for the one here that had the allergic response to it). So, if you really like cinnamon, (that be me), you can't do better than this for flavor, unless you chew it off the tree.  Good luck with that one.  I'm not much of a hot tea drinker except in winter.  So this summer, I made a gallon of sun tea with this and I-am-now-addicted! I use 8 or 9 bags per gallon.  If the sachets, then 6 or 7.  I like my tea strong so I leave the bottle out for as long as it takes me to remember I put it out there.  No bitterness at all.  I can always dilute the mixture if I have to.  But that's what ice cubes give up their lives for.  I'll never go back to orange pekoe again.  Take THAT, Lipton!

I work at a school and have shared tea bags with lots of other teachers, and they all love it too - rave reviews from everyone who's tried it.  This is my all-time favorite tea.  Good any time of day.  Good hot or cold.  Good brewed weak or strong.  Worth every penny.  And the delivery was outstanding too.  I 've ordered it twice and it arrived really fast both times.  Super happy customer (and that's sayin' something, because I can be darn cranky about things).  :)

review/summary: Awesome, Flavorful Tea!
review/text: I absolutely LOVE this tea. The first time I had it was when I had a wonderful meal at Ruth Chris Steak House and they served it to me there. I was so entranced by it,I asked the waitress where they bought it. Not only did she tell me, she also gave me four tea bags to take home!<br /><br />Needless to say, I've been hooked since then. This tea is just sweet and spicy enough to be absolutely satisfying. It tastes remarkably like the red hot cinnamon candy - which if you had asked me beforehand if I would like, I would have said no. But it's just the right blend to make it perfect.<br /><br />Another reason I love it is because it satisfies my sweets craving without actually  having to have sweets. Who wouldn't love a nice zero-calorie tea that tastes just as good as the candy?<br /><br />Try it for yourself - you will love it!

review/summary: I feel so fancy drinking this
review/text: I am addicted to caffeine. If there were street pushers in shady parts of town selling it, I would be there looking for my fix. Thankfully, it is a legal stimulant and Amazon is my dealer.<br />Hot Cinnamon Spice is not so much a radical break from my normal coffee and tea habits, it is more of a revelation that I can get a heck of a flavor along with that sweet caffeine hit.<br />It has a fairly strong cinnamon smell, but the flavor is neither overpowering nor "hot" as the name may say. I would recommend drinking without adding any sugar, milk or cream to it, as it is sweet in it's natural state and this is a flavor that should not be drowned out. That, and milk is disgusting.<br />After I made a cup at work, the vultures started circling wondering what the wonderful aroma was. 50 bags seemed silly to purchase, but with by freeloader coworkers they will be gone in no time.<br />I give it two snaps up.

review/text: Wow this is really spicy and cinnamony (if that is a word). A bargain really considering that you get 50 large bags in a box. I would advise that this tea tastes quite sweet to me without any added ingredients out of the box. So go careful on sugar. May I suggest pairing this with the wonderful organic agave cinnamon sweetner available through Amazon as a compliment. (ASIN: B0048INV38). This makes it a cinnabomb.

review/text: I've tried two different brands of cinnamon spice tea, and even though this is most likely derivative of the first brand, Harney & Sons' version is so much better. It isn't quite as bitter and the cinnamon gives you a more rounded taste, instead of being overpowering.<br /><br />The scent is intoxicating, and the tea tastes naturally sweet - its great for a cold day!

review/summary: Great High Quality Tea With A Strong Cinnamon Taste
review/text: I've enjoyed an Orange Pekoe and Black Tea blend for years.  About eight years ago, I was introduced to an Indonesian brand that was a blend of Orange Pekoe, Black Tea, and Cinnamon.  It was incredible!  However, it was bought at a discount store and I was never able to purchase it retail - despite my dogged attempts.  Ever since, I have been forced to go from one imitator to another looking for a replacement.<br /><br />Enter Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice which I first purchased at a specialty store that carried somewhat exotic products and have since purchased on Amazon.com.  What can I say other than WOW!!!!  This tea has such an INCREDIBLE taste.  It is almost indescribable how beautifully the black tea mixes with the cinnamon and orange in your tea cup.  I love the cinnamon taste so much, I actually OVER steep my tea bag in order to infuse as much of the powerful cinnamon taste as possible.  I'm sure many tea enthusiasts in the UK and here in the US would be aghast at the thought of over-steeping tea as normally you would be left with a strongly bitter cup as the black tea would infuse too much of its taste into the water.  However, this does not happen with Harney & Sons.  Instead, the only thing you get is a stronger and stronger cinnamon & orange taste.  I steep my tea so long that I often have to reheat my cup, but it is so utterly delicious (that would be the basking in fields of flowers with rainbows and unicorns kind of delicious) that I'm willing to wait another minute or two.  Add a little sweetener and a touch of cream and its TO DIE FOR!!!<br /><br />As you can see, I can't say enough good things about either Harney & Sons teas in general or the Hot Cinnamon Spice blend in particular.  I was so happy to find this tea - it truly blows away any brand that I've found - one of the many instances where you win when you pay for quality!

review/summary: go for the satchels in the tin, I guess . . .
review/text: If you LOVE cinnamon, this is apparently the tea to buy, especially in satchels in the more expensive tin. Based on the rave reviews, I bought the economical box - and, for a gift to have on hand, the nice-looking tin . . . before realizing that the satchels in the tin are touted to taste better than the 50 bags in the box. Glad the gift tea should be better! I LIKE cinnamon - but to love these tea bags, it would help if you love cinnamon (especially if you enjoy Red Hots or hot spicy food). I usually enjoy my tea strong and with milk, but I suspect I'll be diluting this one with lots of milk. So far, I've found Harney & Sons tea to be high-quality tea - and cinnamon is healthy, so I'm okay with this purchase. But I don't plan to restock this zinger in my pantry :)

review/text: This is a great tea, and if you have never had their Hot Cinnamon Sunset you will be none the wiser that it could be even better.  I fell for the price difference and decided to give it a try.  Truth be told I will buy it again because it is just so much less then the other.  But sometime I am guessing I will splurge and get the real thing.  Enjoy both, you will be glad you did.
