review/summary: I Don't Have Any  Food Allergies
review/text: I love these banana cookies even though I can eat any other brand/ingredient.  Yes, the texture is DIFFERENT, but that's what I really like about them.  It kind of reminds me of mexican wedding cookies -dry, melt in your mouth texture.  They are really expensive compared to name/store brand cookies, so I have to maintain my self-control and eat only one every few days :(

review/summary: Great snack for on-the-go!
review/text: I tried the Nana's Bananas cookie bars for the first time this week. I love them! I don't have any gluten issues so I can't speak for that, but I really enjoyed the real banana taste of these cookies. Some people complained about the drier texture, which I will admit is a little different than an actual cookie, but it I always have it with something to drink anyway so the drier texture is not a problem for me. The cookies are nice and soft and there are little delicious crunchy bits in the mix. I bring them to work for a nice afternoon snack :) I will definitely be buying them again soon!

review/text: Lots of double fudge cookies! What could be better?.... I bought these because the texture and taste remind me of the Cosmic Brownies I ate when I was a kid, the super unhealthy ones by Little Debbie.  Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Cookie bars are so much healthier and pretty darn close to the real thing(without the fudge topping)... They are delicious and a healthier blast from the past for me! YUMMMMM!

review/text: The berry vanilla is one of my favorite from Nana's.  I also like the chocolate munch when I am wanting something with a chocolate flavor.  They are dry amd crumble.  That doesn't bother me.  I have been gluten-free for five years and have tried near everything.  Nana's has become part of my weekly grocery list.  They are easy to take on the go.  I think these would be great for parents with allergic children because they are packaged for on the go.  It can be frustrating to be out and you suddenly get hungry and there is nothing gluten-free to be found.

review/summary: Moderately tasty, gluten free
review/text: Our family has members who keep kosher, who are vegetarians, who are unable to eat gluten, etc.  This cookie covers all the bases, but tends to be soft and not entirely tasty.  However, they can be used to make a gluten free pie crust, which is a great feature.  I have the feeling that if they were baked a little longer they would be better.<br /><br />Really, though, how good can a gluten free cookie be?

review/text: Our daughter has several food allergies, so Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars are perfect!  Out of all the Gluten-free cookies out there, my daughter just LOVES Nana's.  NO eggs, NO dairy, NO refined sugar, NO hydrogenated oils, NO Cholesterol, NO Casein, NO Soy, NO Corn.  They are made from natural ingredients and sweetened with fruit juice.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, for the average person these do not taste like a regular cookie.  I do not personally like the texture, but the chocolate flavor is good.  I will say that this is a wonderful product for people with food allergies, but not someone who can have regular cookies.

review/text: These cookie bars are fudgy and yummy and tasty and healthy and...<br />So good!!  I am a big fan of these.  When I order a case of these I always think, "man that is a lot of cookie bars!  I am probably not going to be able to finish them all."  Probably being the operative word.  Well low and behold (with the help of my husband and 6 year old daughter) they are gone quickly and we are ordering more.  If you are adding more whole wheat to your diet, these work.  If you are looking to get rid of refined sugar in your diet, these work.  If you order them and don't like them: you must have been one of those really picky kids that grew up to be a picky adult!  They are fabulous!  To eat them is to love them.

review/summary: My son loves these cookie bars!
review/text: My 8 year old son has numerous allergies plus autism and these cookie bars are a life saver!  They're made with fruit juice as opposed to cane sugar, so I don't feel bad about giving them to him.  We've tried many gluten free cookies, these are by far his favorites!  Unfortunately the local stores don't keep them well stocked, so I'm glad I found them here.  If you're not used to gluten free products, you probably won't like them.  The texture is very different than wheat, but if you haven't had wheat in quite a while, these are very tasty and not as crumbly as other gluten free products.  They are fabulous cookies and I'm so glad Nana's makes them...don't ever stop!

review/summary: Cookies you don't have to feel guilty about eating!
review/text: I was excited to find Nana's line of gluten-free cookies, and have tried all the varieties that they offer. Of the various flavors and styles of cookies, these are my favorite. I find their individually packaged cookies (the large, round ones) to be way too heavy for one meal and end up splitting them for two snacks. These 8 pack cookies are the perfect size for a little snack or to keep in your purse. I can understand why some reviewers might not like these cookies because they do have a very healthy taste, and some might object to the texture of the berry crystals. I happen to like the berry crystals, and it's nice to eat a cookie that you don't have to feel dietary guilt over! A great "hearty" cookie that goes well with coffee or tea.  Also, I am gluten intolerant and have never had any negative reaction to these cookies whatsoever. In my opinion, a good product. However, because it is natural and doesn't have preservatives, the faster the item is shipped to you after packaging, the better. I have noticed that Nana's cookies do become more dry the longer you keep them around, even sealed. Probably a good idea to try this product before buying a case of it, because I have noticed that people either seem to love or hate the Nana cookies.

review/text: I love Nana's GF lemon cookies, so I figured I'd try these berry vanilla bars too.  They're a nice, soft texture but I am not crazy about the taste.  I feel strange about the berry flavoring in a cookie with no real berries, just little dried crunchies sporadically in the cookie.  I think I will try the chocolate bars next time around.

review/text: I know what you're probably thinking: They're vegan, they're gluten-free...they're a dream come true! The taste of these bars is very banana-y<br />but I doubt you'll be able to ignor the texture long enough to enjoy that. The texture is akin to eating a handful of dirt (I'm no dirt-eating pro...but when I was trying to chew that's all I kept thinking). Please...if you're thinking about trying these...go down to your local natural foods market and pick up a box there first...while you're at it you may want to get some of your favorite soymilk...and lots of it!<br /><br />PS<br />If you're in the market for a yummy vegan bar...try the Betty Lous brand...The strawberry is super good!

review/summary: My kids LOVE them
review/text: When I found out two of my children were allergic to dairy and eggs, it was quite an adjustment.  Fortunately, we found Nana's Fudgy Wudgy Bars fairly soon after their diagnoses.  The kids think they are delicious, and I love them as a parent because they are a bit healthier than most "treats".  They are also conveniently packaged so that if we go to a birthday party, the kids can just grab a bar, and take it with them so they aren't left out when cake is served.  I give a package to their teachers too at the beginning of the year so that if there are any special occassions celebrated at school, my kids still get their treat.  The fact that my kids consider them a special treat, they must really be yummy, although I have yet to try them myself.  BTW, we tried a few other flavors of Nana's bars and cookies, but this one is the only one my kids like (or should I say love).

review/summary: NOT GLUTEN FREE!
review/text: After eating this product, I had a stomach ache followed by hours on the toilet. Those of you with a gluten intolerance and Celiac disease know exactly what those symptoms mean... somehow this product is contaminated with gluten! It is NOT gluten free! Please spare yourself the pain and suffering. These cookies are not worth it.<br /><br />For those of you who are tempted to continue eating this product even after you have been informed that it is not gluten free, please keep these facts in mind:<br />1. If you eat gluten, it damages your intestinal lining.<br />2. If you keep on eating gluten the damage to your intestines will get worse and so will your symptoms.<br />3. If you further continue to eat gluten you will end up in malabsorption, increase your risk for intestinal cancer, and lead to all sorts of problems including infertility, autoimmune disorders, oteoporosis.<br />In other words, cheating on your diet is not worth it!<br />Don't eat Nana's products!<br /><br />Instead, I suggest you buy something like Pamela's chunky chocolate cookies. They are one of my favorites.

It rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good.<br /><br />I'm now half way through my second jar of Tone's, which is consistently excellent.  It has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli.  It is way better than raw garlic cloves.  They must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder.  If you have doubts about your current garlic powder, smell it.  If it doesn't have a strong garlic smell, it's just white powder.  Get this Tone's and you'll get your delicious food back.

The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C.

The top makes it easy to refasten, so it doesn't go to waste and can be used again. I love the pouch, it's easy to get all the product out wihtout making a mess.

review/summary: Passed the Taste Test
review/text: No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children.

review/summary: Worthwhile treats
review/text: At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

The were were very old and hard...  We only opened one and it broke into pieces. Because it's a food item, you can't return which I think is ridiculous...we couldn't even eat them! I order lots of stuff from Amazon and have had a great experience except for these fruit roll ups. Don't buy food from Amazon! (The only reason I gave it 1 star is because I had to click on something and they did arrive on time).

review/summary: Great for our dogs!
review/text: Our two Golden Retrievers have been on Beneful Weight Control now for at least 3 years. We didn't see any out of the ordinary pooping problems that others mention.  They love it and both have lost considerable weight -- both were considered "obese," but now one is normal weight and the other is only slightly overweight.  My only real complaint is they stopped selling it (at least around here) in the larger 40-50lb bags.  Now you can only find these 31lb bags but the price is the same.  We go through about 2 bags a month, so it's a little pricey.

review/summary: unless you want to pick dog poop off the floor...I don't recommend
review/text: We have two dogs and after a few weeks of switching to the Beneful Healthy Weight we've noticed very unpleasant results. They whine to go outside much more than they ever have and actually had bowel movements right in front of us if we don't get them outside in time.  Our dogs have gone from needing to go outside a few times a day to 6 or 7 times daily to handle the number of bowel movements they have. My theory is this dog food just goes right through the dog and not much of it actually is being utilized by the body. Which makes me wonder how many nutrients my dogs are actually receiving.  Poor dog food in my opinion and should only be used if your dog needs a laxative. I will most likely be going back to Purina One.

review/summary: False Advertising, Terrible Dog Food!!
review/text: I bought this dog food because the bag showed pictured of veggies and chunks of meat, and with a name like "Beneful" I thought I was purchasing a nutritious brand of dog food. My dogs did eat this food, but after reading the ingredients I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my dogs. The first three ingredients are Ground yellow corn, chicken by-product meal, and corn gluten meal. How disgusting is that?! The main ingredient is a corn filler. One thing my vet told me a while back that I never forgot: "When you eat corn, what comes out of the other end? The same thing happens with dogs." Basically, dogs cannot digest corn, it is just a filler and causes them to actually eat more to feel full, poop out more, and retain less nutrients. The only meat in Beneful at all is a by-product, its not even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product to anyone, for any reason, ever. It is an absolutely awful dog food. I can't believe the pictures of veggies and full chunks of meat on the bag can be allowed to be on the packaging of such a disgusting product; it is very misleading and should be considered false advertising.<br /><br />I recommend to stay far away from Beneful, and most Purina products. When purchasing a dog (or cat) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural, organic foods such as Blue Buffalo, Halo or Wellness.

review/summary: Dog loves it, but it doesn't love him
review/text: I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE.

review/summary: Fresh Unsweetened Tea On Demand
review/text: I purchased a Keurig so my husband could make just one cup of coffee for breakfast instead of making a French press full and pitching half of it.  I use it to make unsweetened iced tea.  With the plethora of sweetened iced tea k-cups, it's great to have one with the good, clean and fresh taste of unsweetened tea.  I use the largest setting and then add about 1/2 cup of cold water to the Pyrex liquid measuring pitcher.  With the addition of water, it cuts the strength to the proper consistency.  I don't bother with all the glasses with ice and then brewing over ice.  I just make the tea and pour it from the pitcher.  Good stuff.

review/text: This tea makes extremely dark and strong tea on the 11oz setting which is my largest water capacity setting. I use the Keurig Iced Beverage Tumblers filled with ice and can't drink it straight.  My solution is to fill a gallon pitcher with ice, add some water, make two iced brew K-cups and pour it over the ice water for what I consider perfect iced tea.  You can forego the water for stronger tea, or add more water to dilute the tea depending on your mood or tastes.  This tea has excellent flavor, it's just too strong right out of the Keurig for my tastes and in my opinion requires diluting.  Excellent for making a pitcher of tea!

review/text: Great taste. There is a slight bitterness to this tea, but it's black tea - it's bound to be a little bitter, especially for being so strong. The strength is perfect for customizing to taste. Some people like strong tea while others like theirs very mild, so you can add more water if you want. I like to make a fairly strong tea (the melting ice dilutes it just fine) and sweeten it myself. I like sweet tea, but usually when I get it, it just tastes like sugar water. These give me the strong tea flavor I love, and I can add the perfect amount of sweetness. Great product!

review/text: This is a really easy way to make terrible iced tea.  Sometimes convenience outweighs taste, but not always.  What this product doesn't tell you before you buy it is that the ingredients are: black tea with tea extract, hibiscus and citric acid.  It's not just tea.  And it doesn't taste like just tea, either.  It tastes like powdered iced tea from a jar.  It has an overtaste of lemon -- that's probably the citric acid.  And that fake tea flavor that comes from powdered iced tea mix.  I'll probably drink it when it's really convenient.  But I won't serve it to friends!  And I won't drink it if I have time to make a glass of real tea and pour it over ice.

review/text: This tea is so strong you might as well not waste time brewing and just chew the leaves right out of the container. It's strong not in a normal strong tea way. Instead it's bitter. If you use a Keurig model that has cup size settings a recommendation is to go with the largest setting for the largest cup you can fit under the Keurig and work backward from there until you get to the taste you prefer. Also note that while it's in smaller print, there is a warning not to use a glass to make the iced tea which is a warning worth paying attention to.

The best part about this food is that toy breeds can be on this from the time their little puppies til they're full grown- for life!  Try finding another dog food that does that!  This is a MUST if you have a toy breed dog.  It helps balance their glycemic index even at the most stressful periods of time.  Overall, it is just a really healthy food that will make your dog look and feel beautiful inside and out!

The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a "small" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies.

review/summary: My dog loves them!
review/text: My four year old chinese crested mix loves these dog treats. He is somewhat of a picky eater when it comes to dog treats but he loves these. They smell nice and minty and take a little while for him to eat so it gives him something to work at. They are made with good ingredients. No meat byproducts or corn! AND they are made in the USA which is definite plus. I will continue to get these for my pup.

review/summary: Low calorie, tooth friendly, and my dog loves them
review/text: My dogs really like these. My six year old adopted Spoodle came to us with bad teeth and a weight problem. She had 14 teeth pulled and is halfway to her weight goal, and has learned to like crunchy snacks.<br /><br />My ten year old lab likes anything, but also needs to watch his teeth and his weight.<br /><br />I like to give them a treat before I leave the house, so that they are happy instead of anxious when they see me get my coat and keys.<br /><br />These treats are perfect at only 18 calores each, and the dogs are excited to eat them. The lab makes short work of it, but the Spoodle gets to give her remaining teeth a workout. ChristineJW

review/text: My dog really enjoys these and they do not last long. She is not a big chewer, and doesn't like bones, so I wanted to get something that she could much on from time to time so to help clean her teeth. I was attracted to these because they are low calorie and made in the US. When you get them out of the package they don't look like food, but the dogs don't really mind. They are flexible enough to cut in half with kitchen shears if you have a small dog.

They don't take her very long to finish, but they are a nice little snack or treat for her while still being healthy. My moms smaller dog, about 12 lbs also likes these, although the smaller ones are best for her.

review/text: My dogs are very tiny and I needed a chew that would have the benefits of teeth cleaning but without any weight gain, and these did great, plus my dogs enjoyed them. If a dog doesn't like the taste and won't chew on a dental stick, then it would defeat the purpose. So these fit the bill all around.

review/summary: My picky eater likes these
review/text: I was skeptical that my dog would chew on these treats, but he does seem to like them.  They smell like cinnamon and are very low in calories.  My mini dachshund suffered kidney damage after contracting Leptospirosis.  He is on a special diet of rice and a small amount of protein.  Dogs on these diets often suffer from dental disease. I needed something to clean his teeth, but also not introduce high protein to his diet. These chews are 18% crude protein, much lower than other chews, and contain fiber (chia seeds and flaxseed) and antioxidents like green tea. A win-win situation for my dog's overall health.

review/summary: The best of the energy chews!
review/text: I'm a runner doing 30-50 miles a week and am currently (9/10) training for the Chicago Marathon.  I've tried all of the gels and chews that are out there and these are my favorite.  I don't like gels as that squirt of mush activates my gag reflex.  Plus you always need water with them.  I've tried all of the other brands of energy chews (I think); Sharkies (good but sticky and not very tasty), Clif Shot Bloks (nice package, very sticky on the fingers), GU Chomps (super sticky and caused some nausea), PowerBar Gel Blasts (very good but tough to chew if cold).  The Honey Stinger chews are very easy to chew and you don't need water.  They don't stick to your teeth either.  The main selling point for me is that they taste good and don't cause nausea no matter what.  I'm sticking with these ones.

Good consistent and natural energy and electrolytes.  No stomach upset, which I always got w/ Gu.

review/text: I hate to just echo everyone else, but these things<br />really ARE that good. Like a lot of folks, I hadn't<br />heard of these before Backpacker Magazine<br />raved about them in April of '09.<br />I gave 'em a try and was blown away.<br /><br />Over the years I've found that I find food<br />--on long hikes--less and less appetizing...<br />especially when the temperature is over 90.<br />The thought of chewing and swallowing is<br />not appealing.<br /><br />Obviously SOME nourishment is still necessary,<br />but I came to dread PowerBars, and then next, the<br />tastier bars they spawned. So I switched to gels,<br />but after awhile, I came to dread those, as well.<br />But these little chews are delicious--I'll eat them<br />even when nothing else sounds good.<br />Between hikes, I keep them out of sight, because<br />otherwise I'd snack on them at home.<br />I'm on here now ordering another dozen for a big hike.

Kinda like gum drops and there's lots of them in a bag so you dont feel like you got cheated.  I think I like these more than any other sports chews I have tried.  They also dont leave your fingers sticky after handling them.  I hope they come out with new flavors.

They're easy to chew, taste great, don't stick in my teeth or make me extra thirsty, and the packet is small enough to be portable.  I really like that the ingredients are pronounceable and healthy enough (organic tapioca, cane sugar, fruit juice, etc.).<br /><br />However, I don't see how they're any different from organic fruit snacks (like Annie's bunnies), which I can get much cheaper in a multi-pack from my local wholesale club.  The ingredients and nutrition information are virtually identical.  For that reason, I gave them just 4 stars.

review/summary: Good substitute for candy but Sharkies are healthier
review/text: These are a good alternative to candy, but still a lot of sugar in a better form.<br />Sharkies energy sports chews are not quite so sweet BUT are Healthier becasue the man ingredient is brown rice syrup which is a complex carbohydrate with low glycemic index. Being very hypogylcemic brown rice syrup and agave nectar are the only two natural sweetners that don't cause a "sugar crash". So for this reason the stingers only get 3 stars and sharkies get 5! If you want sweeter in sharkies get the kids version, but they are like stingers- no brown rice syrup. Oh, the brown rice version fill me up faster because they are a complex carbohydrate and don't cause blood sugar fluctuations.

review/text: I am a huge fan of Stinger products. However, these little gummy gels do nothing as compared to the Stinger Honey Packs. If you are a road or mountain biker and need a good burst of quick energy to keep from bonking on that last hill, these will not help. In fact, the only benefit that I (or any of my riding buddies) have found is that they make your mouth water. Conceivably, this could help with water consumption when riding through the desert (Moab, Fruita). It is my guess that these are not intended for exercising. Maybe, people just use them at work to keep from eating Starburst or something less healthy?!

review/summary: Not too sticky, great for long runs!
review/text: I'm not a fan of messy gels, or stopping for PowerAde during a race. When I do my own long runs or if I'm doing a half, mess and inconvenience factor aside I also don't want to consume junk. These are organic and contain honey, and while soft & squishy somehow don't get stuck to each other when shoved in a gel pocket during a run. The taste is so delicious that my son tries to swipe them as well!

review/summary: Quite tasty!
review/text: I tasted a few of these and they are pretty good.  I was expecting something a bit flavorless and I can imagine happily snacking on these for a multi-day packing hike.  I will write more after I have taken them on the trail.

review/summary: AWESOME !!!
review/text: Tried the pink lemonade flavor today during my long run...unbelievably awesome. Tasted great, no stomach issues, no sticking to my teeth, water not required to "wash it down" and most importantly - it was the best run I've had in a long time. Can't wait to try other flavors.
