review/summary: Love these!!!!
review/text: Unlike the other flavors of the Ice Breakers Mines line, the taste of the Cinnamon doesn't get old or tired. Because you have to travel a minimum of 200 miles outside the St Louis Market to get this one flavor, I thought I would give mail order a try. I normally depend on traveling family and friends to bring them back to me.

I can't get enough of any cinnamon candy no matter how hot, sweet, or hard they can be.  These are by far the best cinnamon mints that exist.<br /><br />Enough said...

review/summary: Best Mints I've Ever Had
review/text: I enjoy having mints on standby for various reasons, and have always enjoyed the flavor of cinnamon more than any other flavor available on the market.  I find spearmint to be a bit "too much" when it comes to flavor, seeing how the flavor tends to be too "minty" and can linger for quite some time.  I have always leaned towards the cinnamon flavor of mints no matter which brand or kind it is in regards to.<br /><br />Well, several years ago I encountered the Ice Breakers Cinnamon Mints at a local convenience store.  I immediately fell in love with the taste.  The cinnamon flavor is strong, without being too overbearing, and the amount of mints that each container comes with is bountiful beyond belief.  I simply could not resist purchasing more of these.  It had become a monthly tradition of mine, to ensure that I had some of these mints laying around at all times.<br /><br />However, recently I discovered that none of my local stores carry the cinnamon flavor anymore, instead only offering the "Wintergreen", "Spearmint" and "Sours" varieties, with no cinnamon in sight.  I was jubilant to discover that the cinnamon flavoring was offered by Amazon.<br /><br />These mints are great to have around, and the quantity of the package (eight containers) is more than enough to satisfy even the most die hard of mint addicts, such as myself.  There simply is no mint better than these, despite the fact that they are extremely rare to come by.

My husband said these were close to the best Christmas present I've ever given him.

review/summary: Very good vegan, organic, gluten free mashed potatoes!
review/text: The directions on the box need tweeking, these need much more liquid than the directions state. If you only add the amount of water and milk product recommended they turn out dense and gummy.  Increase the water to 1 1/2 cups and the milk product to 3/4 to 1 cup and add a little Earth Balance margarine and they come out perfect!  These are so quick and easy to prepare, it's really nice to be able to make these when I'm tired and don't feel like cooking. Good deal with Subscribe & Save, normally you get price gouged for vegan, gluten free products. Thank you Edward & Sons!<br /><br />Nice garlic flavor, better than the cheese flavored variety.  Has actual roasted garlic bits in it, but not too much. Just add hot water, margarine and "milk" product.

So the mix has no saturated fat, or regular fat, which is nice.<br /><br />I've found an easier way (for me) to mix it up though:<br />1. boil water (1/2-2 cups, depending on how much you're making)<br />2. mix butter/margarine with boiling water for the amount you're making<br />3. mix in potato flakes and milk product<br /><br />I like to serve it with melted margarine, but gravy is good too. If you make it properly it has a great consistency.

review/text: I like to make my own garlic mashed from scratch organic ingredients including real butter and heavy cream; but low ebb health times made me want to try a dried product. Didn't expect to like it, but planned to use it in a pinch, or maybe for thickening.<br /><br />LOVE this! I especially enjoy the roasted garlic.<br /><br />You have to like the flavor of garlic, and mix it according to instructions, though [meaning mostly to not over stir, which IMO can cause gummy or poor texture]. I like a thick texture, and when I make my own mashed from scratch, I leave the skins on and always want a few potato lumps showing. Creaminess I get from using enough butter and cream.<br /><br />I appreciated other reviews including ingredients lists and giving suggestions on tweaking the box directions, all of which helped me in deciding to purchase and making the best of my first mixed batch!<br /><br />If you're concerned about butter, cream, or palm oil, read Dr. Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle</a>. Or read books by Dr's Mary Enig and Sally Fallon, or many others like them.<br /><br />I've made a quick, satisfying meal from these mashed potatoes, using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1766O">Amy's Organic Cream of Mushroom Soup</a> as a gravy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1LXU4">Valley Fresh Premium White Chicken Cuts</a> added.<br /><br />YUM!<br /><br />How refreshing to know that all the above are organic, which is supposed to mean NO GMOs, NO toxic additives, and NO soy.<br /><br />[Note that some organic purveyors use what they call organic soy, but I need to avoid any type of soy when possible, due to unavoidable overdoses, which BTW and IMO, are why my health is low ebb, i.e., I'm sick of and from overdoses of soy, additives, and GMO's, see my Listmania].<br /><br />Thank you Amazon organic vendors!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt

review/summary: Edward & Sons organic mashed potatoes are an excellent choice for those who want an organic and/or gluten free product ...
review/text: Every time you reconstitute dehydrated foods such as this one, there is always a bit of change you might want to make before you get it to your own particular taste.  With this package of mashed potatoes you can either make two or four servings.  I'd suggest that you might want to prepare the two servings and think about how you'd like to individualize the "recipe."  For example, if you are going to be using a gravy, you might want to leave the recipe as is.  If you like yours whipped or creamy you may wish to add extra milk or a dollop of butter on the top.  Garlic fans may want to throw in some extra garlic powder as the taste is subtle.<br /><br />These organic mashed potatoes are definitely customizable. One suggestion that is offered is "for creamier potatoes, add more milk product (stir in 1 Tbsp at a time to read desired consistency.)  For firmer potatoes, let sit 2-3 minutes before serving."  These potatoes can be either made on the stovetop or in the microwave.  Either way you wish to prepare them you are looking at under five minutes.  Many people object to the palm oil as it is one of the ones we are ask to limit or avoid, but then again so is cocoa butter in chocolate.  In order for you to decide I'll list the ingredients and the basic nutrition facts listed on the box.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic Potato Flakes (organic potatoes, mono and di-glycerides from organic palm oil), Organic Onion Powder, Organic Roasted Garlic, Sea Salt, Organic Garlic Powder, Organic Black Pepper.<br /><br />NUTRITION FACTS:<br /><br />Serving Size 1/3 cup dry mix (25g)<br />1/2 cup prepared<br />Servings Per Container:  4<br /><br />Calories  90<br />Calories from fat  0<br /><br />Total Fat  0g<br />Saturated Fat  0g<br />Trans Frat  0g<br /><br />Cholesterol  0mg<br /><br />Sodium 180mg  7%<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 20g  7%<br />  Dietary Fiber 2g  7%<br />  Sugars &lt;1g<br /><br />Proteins 2g<br /><br />I didn't include the nutritional facts with milk / soy milk / vegan spread or water as that would vary widely.  We do like these potatoes and I certainly like the last minute convenience factor if I don't have time to prepare fresh potatoes or am out of them.  There is a recipe from "Allison's Kitchen" for roasted garlic potato-broccoli soup that sounds delicious.  Edward & Sons organic mashed potatoes are an excellent choice for those who want an organic and/or gluten free product.

There is a hole in the top to pour slowly but it needs to be a bit smaller.  I wish there was a measuring device with it.  For spills it needs to be wiped up quickly, it can stain.

review/text: Costco is a wonderful place to learn about food.  When I saw a woman putting a five pound package of baby back ribs in her cart, I asked her if she grilled them.  "Oh no" she replied, "I bake them in the oven."  Her recipe was to wrap them (sealing well) in heavy-duty foil, put them on a cookie sheet, and bake at 350 degrees for three hours - adding barbecue sauce the last half-hour.  The sauce her family preferred was Woody's, made in New Orleans.  At first, I was able to buy it in our local super market, but then came Katrina and it was (temporarily) discontinued. The super market has never begun stocking it again, so my daughter and I both order it. When I couldn't find it, I tried some others, but once you use Woody's, nothing else tastes as good.

review/text: For a quick cheap meal that stores well and requires very little effort, Lipton Noodle Soup is a pretty good choice.  It tastes like chicken noodle soup (well, sort of), which is what you'd expect, and is fairly good if you rate it against what it's supposed to be.  It has a good long shelf life, so you don't have to worry too much about tossing it in the pantry and pulling it out when you next find it.<br /><br />Great for camping, day trips, or just if you don't feel like anything complicated.  Time to mix it up?  Just add water.<br /><br />It's not gourmet (and it's not supposed to be).  The consistency is a little off, flavor different than you'd expect for fresh, and boy is this stuff salty.  But what did you expect?  It's soup in a box, and it serves its purpose.  If you wanted gourmet, you wouldn't be getting it from a box anyway.<br /><br />It does what it's supposed to do well, and that's what matters.

review/summary: just not as good as it used to be
review/text: I don't mind the taste with the lower sodium, in fact am glad, but changing the distinctive square shaped noodles to round ones has in my mind ruined the texture and taste of the soup.  I'm using a generic brand now made by Safeway which still has the square noodles, typical of German noodles.  I think also the round noodles are just cut off angel hair pasta and don't have the nice flavor of real egg noodles.

review/text: I'm not much of a soup person and I like salty things. Growing up (poor in Brooklyn), my mom made this for us on a regular basis and it's still my favorite. Now my 6 yr old loves it too. I like to put less water than recommended for a stronger taste. This also allows me to throw in some ice cubes to cool it down quick when I make it for my daughter. When I have a sore throat, this is my go-to therapy!

It a rarity to find one fairly fresh, and yet still there the hint of the feeling the noodles are made of chalk. It obvious they tried to safe a penny too many in regards to their noodle.

You won't get the, "You got milk mustache" or some cute latte art, but you can really taste a nice combination of strong coffee flavor and milk - tastes great. 100 calories.<br /><br />The milk comes from rBST free cows (I first had to Google it to know what it means), meaning no injection with artificial hormones to increase production of milk. RBST is already banned in Canada, Japan, New Zealand, etc., but not in the US yet.<br /><br />Not better than the hot cappuccino served with the traditional atmosphere, but if you need to run, you can just grab one and throw it in you bag.<br /><br />Product of Denmark.

review/text: Illy issimo cappuccino Italian espresso style coffee drink with lowfat milk and cocoa is a nice little 100 calorie treat in a 8.45 fl. oz. (250 ml) can.<br /><br />1930s Italy under the rule of Mussolini greatly contributed to the development of modern coffee culture, improved coffee-making, and new types of coffee-making equipment. The Horn of Africa (where coffee originated) was under Italian colonization and companies such as illy and Bialetti were founded.<br /><br />In that tradition, this drink is now made in Denmark under the issimo brand from illy and distributed in the U.S. by Coca-Cola.<br /><br />This canned cappuccino has a pleasant taste with a good balance of the coffee, milk, cocoa, and sugar with lots of visible solids. To be sure, it's not as good as freshly made cappuccino but it is what it is.

review/summary: Highest concentration of hemp protein I've been able to find
review/text: I buy Hemp Pro 70 because it has the highest concentration of hemp protein that I've been able to find in any of the hemp protein powders. I use it primarily in smoothies. It does not alter the flavor of the smoothie at all, as far as I can tell. Nominally, it's a relatively expensive product but when compared to others, in real economic terms for the amount of protein per ounce it's a decent price. Everything is expensive nowadays. If you're into being healthy though you know that what you put into your body is not the place to cut corners on spending. After all, "we are what we eat".

review/summary: Great source of lean protein
review/text: Perhaps the purest source of protein (70% of each serving is pure protein) that I've found out there. And for the health-conscious, it has very few ingredients ("hemp protein concentrate + natural plant extracts") so there's really no filler or crap. It's made from ground hemp seed which has had the liquid pressed out of it and then the fiber removed so it is as high a concentration of protein as can be. Be aware: if you use a lot and don't get a decent amount of fiber and water, it could cause minor constipation since it's water-soluble. Normally, this is not a problem. It's great to have a plant-based, non-hydrolyzed, sustainable protein source for building lean muscle.<br /><br />Taste is okay. I can drink it straight mixed with water, but I'm normally downing it in one or two gulps. I love mixing it with oatmeal - doesn't really throw off the taste, but does give it a slight green tint - and putting it in smoothies. Mix it with berries and juices you love, you'll never know it was there!<br /><br />It is a bit pricey. I can get a decent deal when it's on sale at my local health food store, but it's cheapest bought directly from Manitoba Harvest's website. You can buy it in bulk there!<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Good vegan protein
review/text: I have no problem with this product. I read some things that weren't very complimentary and as far as I can tell,weren't true either. I put it in smoothies and the taste is not evident. (Because I tend to avoid sweeter things,as smoothies are,I needed to find another way to use this product. I like using the hemp+fiber in cold cereal,but that has a nutty flavor and it can't be done with this product(to my tastes. Plus it is powdery and I ended up inhaling some of it down my throat when I tried that,which makes you choke/anyone who ever at powdered Nestle's Quick off the spoon as a kid probably knows what I'm talking about. The way,the fastest,easiest way to get a good bit of protein is to add hemp protein to cold cereal. I decided to try grinding/chopping walnuts in my blender,mixing it with this protein-dense hemp protein,adding a little turbinado sugar and putting it in cold cereal. And it works and tastes just fine. Most likely, almonds or sunflower seeds or pumpkin seeds would work just as well,(or other nut/seed  that might be preferred.) Also,using the Light Silk original flavor soymilk,which has some cane sugar in it,also works well. But I use it on Old Fashioned oatmeal. Uncooked and cold,straight from the box,and it is an unsweetened (hot) cereal which is fine,to me and a few other people I know,eaten as a cold cereal).  If someone is using a cereal that already has sweetening in it,I think modifying or altering other sugar(or the soymilk) I mentioned would be best.<br /><br />I like it because it delivers a substantial amount of protein in a compact serving size(protein grams per ounce or protein grams per serving is what I generally look for). I'm happy with this product. I haven't tried it in cereal yet but I might. Someone told me the hemp + fiber was good in cereal and I thought they were nuts.(Again,I already was using hemp protein + fiber but only used it in smoothies) But I tried it in some Yogi vegan cereal with unsweetened soy milk and it was very good. This is straight hemp protein without fiber and for typical use of protein powders, I like it. I shy away from soy powders so I'm always glad to find a product that delivers a substantial amount of plant-based,vegan protein.

review/text: I won't lie..this stuff has two big drawbacks: 1) It's expensive, and 2) It's not the tastiest protein powder out there. If I had one word to describe the flavor, it would be "beany". The taste strongly reminds me of soy flour. Fortunately, though, it is not bitter. While I wouldn't call it tasty, it doesn't taste terrible by any means. And wow, does this stuff deliver protein. It gives you about twice as much protein as other hemp protein powders. Good stuff.

review/summary: No grit, sweet taste
review/text: I am a vegetarian body builder. I have tried many types of plant protein supplimentation. Hemp is the gold standard of the plant kingdom, much like eggs are the gold standard of the animal kingdom. Their amino acid profiles are both very complete and similar.<br /><br />Most hemp proteins have a massive amount of fiber though and if you are taking in as many grams of protein as recommended for body building, you will be way too regular I'll put it that way.<br /><br />This 70% formula has less fiber and more protein. In one lb/16oz container there are 15 servings of 21g of protein 0g fiber. It is superior for that alone and is well worth the extra cost per/gram of protein.<br /><br />It disolves easily in water, you can hand mix with a spoon for 1min and your good with not one clump.<br /><br />It is sweeter than normal hemp. Hard to explain, it is a very mild taste compared to other hemp proteins. It's like the bitterness and overpowering herb flavor gets filtered out when the fiber gets removed.<br /><br />I'm glad someone made hemp a pleasure to drink instead of a chore!<br /><br />Hope this review helped.

It may catch you off guard if your used to the "cookies n cream" proteins, but the taste honestly does not make itself apparent in smoothies<br /><br />I make delicious green smoothies daily- but have never tried the powder with just water or any other combination.<br />I usually do whole milk, (trying to put on some weight)  2 big handfuls of spinach/arugula etc, 2 large scoops of Hemp Protein,<br />1 scoop of ground flax seed, then frozen organic fruits to bring it all together. The smoothie comes out a splendid, healthy-looking green color.<br />Cant taste the powder, low sugar, high protein, high fiber, high in omegas as well. Perfect for after workouts or as a breakfast smoothie (think of all the leafy greens !)<br /><br />Definitely give it a try !

I swear the first time I broke the inner seal and smelled the stench I was immediately reminded of Asian shrimp paste!!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love my Asian seafood but I don't like that odor in my drinks!!!  There's a weird taste, too, that makes me want to literally vomit when I think about it...unfortunately, like a nut ('cause I am something of a health nut) I bought six of these!!!!<br /><br />Looks like I'm going to gain weight from all the sugar I'll need to mix into them....

review/summary: Eh...
review/text: This product is mostly what it advertises. It is relatively water soluble, although with more than one tablespoon per 16oz it ends up getting gritty. It also settles out very quickly, so you have to constantly mix it. The taste in water really isn't bad despite the strong smell. I was able to mix it into thick soup with little problem, and the reviewer who suggests mixing with tomato juice is onto something. But when I tried to mix it with other things, I ended up with a completely unpalatable paste. It's not a bad product, but it is difficult to add much of it to most things without making them inedible so I feel that it is also somewhat self-defeating.

review/summary: Vile & Foul
review/text: I have never written a review before but feel I must based on the terrible quality of this product. Before trying it, it smelled and looked fine. The nutritional profile is very good-protein, fiber, carbs, calories-but the taste is horrendous. I am personally content with bland foods, odd flavors and eat an almost sugar free diet. But when this stuff hits your mouth, the taste resembles that of soil mixed with feces. I mixed 2 tablespoons (half the serving size) with 4oz unsweetened almond milk and on the first sip I uncontrollably gagged. I immediately added a whole packet of stevia and that still didn't sufficiently mask the taste. It is completely obvious that the manufacturer spent all the money on finding a way to isolate the protein and absolutely NONE on taste, or taste testing.<br />Based on another review, I purchased Living Harvest. It is super delicious! It does have sugar in it, but not much. There's only 7 grams. The protein content is only 10 grams, but it's edible-which is more than I can say for Manitoba. I tried mixing the Manitoba with the Living Harvest, but it instantly turned it un-palatable.

review/summary: So nice
review/text: This is a really nice oolong tea for this low pricepoint.<br /><br />I tried another purported "Iron Goddess" tea (Numi brand) and was disappointed with how wretchedly green and bitter it was (so much so, I obtained a refund because the product was NOT as described and I felt Numi made a fraudulent claim about the quality and flavor, especially in light of the very high price paid.)<br /><br />SerendipiTea's "Iron Goddess" is light, delicately scented (I catch a very subtle hint of clove, so far, on my 1st tasting), and subtly floral to me. It has hints of greeness, hay and grass flavors, but these are subtle. This is just my first cup from the 1st brewing (not brewed longer than 60 seconds to avoid bringing out bitterness), I have high expectations for the next cup from the same brew, which can be brewed up to 4 minutes (according to the package instructions.)<br /><br />This may not be the very top shelf of the type, Ti Kuan Yin (Iron Goddess of Mercy) is usually very very expensive. But, for what it is, on the low price end, it's a nice tea and very enjoyable. I am happy with the purchase.

review/summary: This is a really delicious soup or bisque as it's called!
review/text: This is a very tasty soup!  Like their lobster bisque, it's flavor is somewhat muted but still has a unique deliciousness all it's own.  I love clams and lobsters so I may be prejudiced in favor of this soup!  I highly recommend it to everyone but beware that it's high in fat (18 gms/can).  The salt level is par for the course for canned soups.... 1280mg/can.  It doesn't say if it's Sea Salt or regular, bad salt.  And the cans are small so the price is actually quite high.  The ingredients list: premium clam juice, finely ground premium clams, cream, wheat flour, butter , tapioca starch, onion powder, salt and proprietary spice blend.....no artificial preservaties, MSG, or trans fats.  This is a truly nutritious, healthful meal.  Good saturated fats are required by the brain and nerves in order to function and repair properly so I accept the % of fat as good in this case.  I will be buying this soup again!

Although there are three major regional and national groceries in the nearest small town, including Wal-Mart, although each carries a selection of DH cake mixes, they carry only the "other brand" of angel food mix.  After years of frustration, I thought:  I have to order almost everything else I get from Amazon, let's see if they can help.  Yeppers...they did and after I compared prices among the several vendors, I found one with prices a little less than I was used to paying in a large city, with free shipping. Happiness at last!

It is refreshing, with a mild flavor and no caffeine so I bring an iced quart to work and enjoy it all day long. It mixes well with other herbal teas as well. I often mix in a teaspoon or two of Two Leaves and a Bud's Alpine Tea for variety and a hint of natural sweetness.<br /><br />As an added benefit, I find that the tea helps keep my rosacea and adult acne from flaring up. When I drink it, my skin is much clearer and I have less redness--and when I don't drink it for a couple of days, the redness returns. I've even used a second steeping as a post-wash rinse; it feels good and seems to help.

So far I have used these in an antipasto platter (which didnt last 10 mins) as an appetizer with some smoked cheese, in pasta salad, and in drinks. i bet these would be good as a fried green bean appetizer too (thinking fried pickle type) or with bacon/panchetta.

There are some crushed cloves, and other cloves that I missed, so there is still a clove taste in the finished chai. Removing the cloves by hand is a pain in the neck, and I won't buy this chai again.  If you like cloves, this won't be a problem for you.

I acquired a liking for chai however the overwhelming spice to this chai is over the top for even me. I wish I could pinpoint exactly what's out of balance with the spices. Unfortunately, this will either be used in potpourri or discarded.<br />I would still be willing to try (one more time) other tea from this company.

review/summary: truly nasty
review/text: This is unlike any chai I've smelled or tasted.  The the cassia oil and maple oil totally overwhelm the clove, orange peel, cardamom and cinnamon (the bag does not list orange peel, cassia oil or maple oil as ingredients, but Amazon's website does).  I can't even be in the same room as the closed bag of tea without getting a headache and feeling like retching.  Had to get it out of the house.

review/summary: Not your standard chai flavor
review/text: I read the many 5-star and 1-star reviews of this product, so I knew when I ordered it that I was taking 16 ounces of tea gamble...<br />This does have a very strong maple flavor. I don't find it "foul" or "overpowering" as described in several reviews, but it's also not what I am looking for in a chai tea, as the maple is stronger than the other spice flavors. I'll finish out this bag and then order some more traditional chai from Tao of Tea or Numi.

review/summary: Strong, but I use half as much
review/text: I've been drinking this tea for over 8 months now.  I found it way too strong at first, and nearly gave up.  So, I now use half as much, and it's still strong enough, and I let it steep for a full 5 minutes.  I've come to just love it now, and I drink it more than I ever did plain black tea.  So, those of you who think it's too strong, try it at half the amount.  Not only better, but lasts twice as long!!!

review/summary: Yuck! Not As Described. No Returns.
review/text: I read the other reviews, and since some said things about it being very spicy I thought I'd give it a shot. I love tea, and especially spicy chai. This stuff is called classic chai, but I have never tasted any chai that is anything like this. I have at least liked if not loved all the other chai teas that I have tried except this chai. My lady is a coffee lover, and we frequent many different boutique coffee shops and even the mainstream ones like starbucks. I have tasted so many varieties at these establishments, and in other places because I have been searching for one that compares to this one place I visited on vacation that served me chai that was so spicy that it kind of had a peppery burn that warmed my throat, it was delicious. I have tried most other varieties available at grocery stores too. I had hopes that this gamble would pay off, but alas, it sucks to the point that it is in my opinion undrinkable! Yes that is my opinion but, you should keep in mind that<br /><br />IT CAN NOT BE RETURNED!<br /><br />I would suggest that the company offer samples or sample size packs for sale so people don't get stuck with nearly a pound of tea that is NOT AS DESCRIBED AND NOT RETURNABLE.
