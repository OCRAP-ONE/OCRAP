review/summary: very boozy
review/text: I suppose the purpose of it being skinnygirl is to take everything sweet out of it, but that takes all the good taste out of it too.  It is really boozy tasting, instead of sweet and tropical tasting.  I really like Bethenny, so I wanted it to taste good, I really did.

review/summary: best potato chips
review/text: I love these potato chips.  I've been eating Season's potato chips for years.  When I buy the unsalted ones, I add a little salt on my own.  They're cooked with peanut oil, which doesn't leave the slight aftertaste that many oils other than this and canola oil do, in my experience. These chips have a great mouth 'feel',light and crisp, not too hard or crunchy.  I highly recommend giving them a try.

review/summary: Michael Season's Ripple chips are a hit with wife!
review/text: We first discovered and bought Michael Season's at Fred Meyer because they are reduced fat and salt, and the taste and consistency are great. But FM stocks only Thin and Crispy and my wife wanted a sturdier version to use with dips. After getting product descriptions from the Michael Season's web site we discovered that they also make reduced fat and sodium Ripple chips. Found that Amazon had them in stock, ordered and received them promptly with free shipping. My wife says that she likes the taste as much as the Thin and Crispy and that the Ripple also stand up to using with thick dips.<br /><br />Also we found that Michael Season's are almost entirely whole chips, whether ordered online or bought from a store, unlike Frito-Lay. After I watched a Frito-Lay sales and stock person literally crush each bag of F-L chips apparently so that he could get more bags into the allotted space I could understand why. Michael Season's is a winner for several reasons. And with Amazon, the price per bag is lower than if bought locally.

You can actually taste the potato these chips were cut from and because of the intense potato taste, you don't miss the salt.

review/summary: Very Tasty Chips
review/text: I bought the Ripple lightly salted chips. I find that the chips are very good as other reviewers have said. I like that that they are lightly salted and it is still enough of a salted taste. The chips were not broken (any more than when you get them in a store) or crushed. They are packaged quite well for shipping. This is February and the expiration date on them is 6 months from now (Aug.). 12-8 0z. pkgs. to a box is a lot of chips but for those who don't know it, the chips can be refrigerated for quite a while, even past the expiration date, and still be as fresh and crispy as if just bought. I put extra crackers and cereal in the fridge too with the same results. I have a fridge in the garage so I can do this. I do recommend these chips.

review/text: The lobster salad is the main attraction here, nice and chunky with lots of lobster meat. This is not an overly moist salad, the main ingredient is lobster. I like that fact because with a lb, I can serve it a couple of different ways. We enjoyed the lobster rolls and still had plenty left over, which I blended into risotto with a little asparagus. I didn't care for the Whoopie pies, they are sugary sweet and the cake has artificial taste. My husband, wholoves chocolate and cake would usually find chocolate cake a match made in heaven but even he didn't find these enjoyable. I recommend the lobster alone or with the rolls but I would skip the Pies. The lobster salad is too yummy to score anything less than 4 stars.

review/text: I was delighted to see Amazon carried this product because I just scraped the last of this delicious mayo out of my jar.  This gives just a little bit of sharpness and tang to everything from sandwiches to egg salad to potato salad.  I'm not fond of pickles and I find that this mayo gives the perfect bit of tang that egg salad or potato salad lacks without the addition of pickles.  I've tried a lot of substitutes, and this is the best I've found.<br /><br />It's just a little bit of heat on the tongue -- not too much.  I particularly like it on a bun with a veggie burger topped with feta cheese and fresh spinach.  It's also great on a chicken sandwich.

review/summary: Not My Favorite Organic
review/text: If you're a gummy bear aficionado like me Haribo Gold Bears are the gold standard.  In the organic world there are Surf Sweets and Yummy Earth.  Surf Sweets are almost indistinguishable from a good quality non-organic gummy bear.  It doesn't have the consistency of Haribo that I love but it's good and fruity.  Yummy Earth has an inconsistent texture that I have actually grown to prefer.  Some are hard and have almost Haribo like texture. Others are very soft.  Some are even stale.<br /><br />For consistency go with Surf Sweets.

review/text: These are the best gummy bears I've eaten in a very long time. I'm 60 years old and still enjoy a chewy candy from time to time. I had almost given up on finding gummy bears that had a real fruit flavor instead of just fruit-like flavor and sweet but each bear in this pack has a distinct flavor of a single fruit. The fact that they're organic just makes them all the better.

review/summary: Clean Flavor
review/text: We tried all of Surf Sweets-bears, worm, jelly beans & sours; each had mostly pros.  The best of all they are all gluten free and don't have any palm oils which we're allergic to also.  They each have clean flavors-not that preservative after taste I remember from my pre-gluten-free years and no one in my family who has multiple allergies has ever had a problem with any of their products.  That is a huge accomplishment-for something to taste this great and none of us to have a reaction!  Ultimately, our favorite was the Surf Sweets Gummy Bears, though they are more chewy than some of the others, we liked that they weren't quite as sweet as the jelly beans or sour as the sours and we liked the size better than the worms.

review/summary: soft yummy ORGANIC gummy bears
review/text: As another reviewer posted and the package states:<br /><br />"Organic fruit juice, Fortiied with Vitamin C, natural colors and flavors, free of Corn Syrup and GMO's, nut-free, and gluten-free"<br /><br />If you like Black Forest non-organic gummy bears (and I'm one of them), these would have to be almost indistinguishable from them - soft and slightly chewy but NOT incredibly chewy like haribo (which I hate) or yummyearth, but unlike yummyearth organic gummy bears whose sweetness you can taste just from the outside of the gummybear, surfsweet's tasty sweetness is buried in the gummy bear like Black Forest.<br /><br />It's 90% organic and "Certified Organic by Quality Assurance International."  Ingredients, as exactly stated on the back of the package, are: "Organic Tapioca Syrup, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Gelatin, Organic Grape Juice Concentrate, Citric Acid, Lactic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Colors Added (including Black Carrot Juice Concentrate, Turmeric, Annatto), Natural Flavors, Organic Sunflower Oil, Carnauba Wax."<br /><br />Of course, the packets of gummy bears are tiny with only ABOUT 10 gummy bears which total only 80 calories.  You don't get many gummy bears per small packet.  But then, they're ORGANIC, corn syrup-free, GMO-free, nut-free and gluten-free.

review/summary: Let Them Eat Candy
review/text: I am one of those moms, you know the one. It takes us 4+ months to eat what they get for Halloween and Easter with some disappearing into the trash almost daily. I allow a piece a day. There is no reason for all that stuff to be eaten until you are sick. My sister and I talk about this all the time, when we were kids, there was never a Sweet Police demanding we make the pick a good one because it would be your only for the day. We were allowed to eat until we were sick which is why I think we now eat until we are sick. Hopefully, by allowing our children to partake but with limits, we are setting them up to live a life of enjoying sweets without going overboard.<br /><br />If they are going to eat candy anyway, make it the good stuff!<br /><br />Surf Sweets Natural and Organic Candy was a big hit with the kids and me. We know kids and adults alike, love candy and now you can eat all those wonderfully, fruity gummies, jellies and sours without all the sugar.<br /><br />Inspired by good, clean fun the makers of Surf Sweets, have created products that were inspired by surfing, active and lifestyles, and natural sweets.<br /><br />My personal favorite was the gummy bears and worms while my kids loved the jelly beans and my niece the sour worms.<br /><br />You can totally taste the difference. They are made only with ingredients found in nature.<br /><br />Big plus to all my Celiac Disease friends out there: Surf Sweets are GLUTEN FREE<br /><br />Need yet another reason to shop Surf Sweets? How about this, they are a cause friendly company who support the organizations committed to improving our planet (water and earth).

review/summary: Premium Olive Oil
review/text: I use olive oil every day. I have three different types in my kitchen and Macia El Altet has my overall top personal rating because it just makes most of the dishes I cook explode with flavors that will dance in a balanced coordination in your palate.<br /> Certain olive oils are so particular that will match certain dishes better than others, Macia El Altet has the particularity that goes well with a great variety of dishes and with an exquisite flavor you won't find in many other so called "extra virgin" olive oils. I was absolutely amazed when I tried Macia El Altet, and now is has a place of honor in my kitchen. I highly recommend it with: Rices (all kinds of paellas or rissotto's), Grilled Veal or Beef (pour on top after grilling, just before serving), Vegetables (steam or grilled) and salads, Pan-Tomat (Toasted bread rubbed with garlic and raw tomato), or just bread dipped in it to taste a world class olive oil!.  I bought it through [...] which gave me a great service and fast delivery.<br />D.Nelson-Boca Raton-Florida

review/summary: Tasted GREAT!
review/text: These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.

review/summary: Not coffee but very satisfying
review/text: First let me say that this is only my opinion, and you know what "they" say about opinions...<br />A while ago I found that I had to give up coffee, which for me was tough because coffee and water are about the only two things I drink. I've never been a milk drinker, nor have I ever been big on juice. And forget tea - maybe some herb tea before bed but it's nothing I want during the day while I'm working. Enter the "coffee substitute". I found numerous brands on line. All of them claim to taste "just like the real thing" and have plenty of reviews by people just like you and me saying how wonderful the stuff is. You could probably serve these people a cup of hot yak urine and tell them it was coffee and they would tell you it was delicious. The truth is, NOTHING but coffee tastes like coffee, and anyone that tries to tell you otherwise needs a new set of taste buds. All of the coffee substitutes I've tried taste like exactly what they're made from - roasted grains, nuts and roots. Most of them contain roasted carob. Carob DOES NOT taste anything like coffee; for one, it's way too sweet. You don't want anything that contains carob. Substitutes made with dates and figs are equally as repulsive. Again - way too sweet. One of the things that gives coffee its appeal is its bitterness. A good coffee substitute has to have some bitterness. So far the only thing I've found that comes close is Orzo brand roasted organic Italian barley. If you drink it black it satisfies like coffee. It takes a few cups but it starts to "grow on you"; after drinking it for a week I've found I like it just as much as, and maybe even prefer it to, coffee. For one thing, it doesn't upset an empty stomach the way coffee does, and you can drink it after dinner without fear of it keeping you up all night.

review/text: My doctor advised me I should stay away from caffeine due to medical reasons- not hypertension. I was horrified! I love coffee, and not only do I need it for a morning pick me up but I love the taste. I was so upset, and started the grieving process. I started to do some research and found this stuff. I placed the order fully expecting it to suck and got my sneakers ready to stomp on the packets in my yard (Still withdrawing and grieving). I just made a pot....I LOVE IT! O.K. it's not coffee, but not that far from it. Not sure if it has a energy boost because I'm drinking it as we speak. Tastes a little smokey, but nice. So happy, now when I make someone coffee (regular), they don't have to endure the sight of me practically sticking my nose in their cup, inhaling the scent, as I take it to them( pathetic I know). I bid my fellow coffee junkies fair well and hope you try this stuff...ok gotta go, drinking my Orzo.

review/text: I have three cappuccino makers and purchased only Peets special moca-java coffee grind! Then I found why I got constant headaches - it was the caffeine. I tried decaf. Decaf coffee is NOT no-caf, especially with Peets and Starbucks. Herbal teas get boring really fast; Teeccino is OK but after a while, ugh. The Italian roasted barley of Cafe Orzo tastes really great, satisfies me the way coffee did. Cafe Orzo recommends adding favorite flavoring; I add Toranio White Chocolate syrup. Result, really amazing flavor! Try it for yourself.

review/summary: tastes ok, but not coffee enough, too barley
review/text: Has a weird smell and taste to it that if I dont cover it up with a flavored creamer I have a difficult time palletting it.  If you want a coffee replacement that tastes like coffee, this falls far from it, but the flavor itself is not bad, but I would say it takes some getting used to.  I tried it as iced coffee too and that was just a huge mistake.  The flavor differences seem enhanced when its cold.  If you're going to drink this instead of coffee, I would recommend drinking it hot and mixing this with regular coffee at varying ratios until you can pallet just 100% orzo.  I personally prefer Teccino, which I am so glad I found.  That stuff tastes amazing and some of their flavors really do taste like coffee yet its still 100% caffiene free; plus it can be prepared in a drip filter AND a french press, where as if you try to make orzo in a french press it clogs up too much and wont press down.

The company spent a great deal of time with me explaining the below and seemed sincere.<br /><br />CHANGE FROM NEW ZEALAND TO US<br /><br />The majority of their customer base was primarily attracted to the naturally occurring 8.0 alkaline water, and had an issue with water being trucked half way around the world.  Most of the customers wanted a similar quality water with less of an environmental impact.  So the company made the business decision to follow this feedback and invested a great deal of effort finding three natural springs in the US that are naturally alkaline.  Water from New Zealand is no long available.<br /><br />The sources and the water quality report from the new US based springs can be found on their site.<br />[...]<br /><br />DISTILLED WATER<br /><br />During this time an unfortunate mishap happened regarding an order of specially requested water by a department store.  This department store requested distilled water.  The bottles were labeled differently, but the cases looked the same and unfortunately some of this water wound up being distributed by mistake.  The company states they will never create another lot of distilled water and while they regret that this water has hit the market in some areas, it is of limited supply and the issue should dissipate.<br /><br />LABELING<br /><br />The original water that was manufactured in New Zealand, says "New Zealand" on the label.  It is no longer being produced.  If you are lucky enough to still be in possession of this water, you have a collector's item.<br /><br />The new US based water, from the three naturally alkaline springs says Source: Multi-Spring, bottled for Eternal Beverages, Walnut Creek CA.  This is the water the company is basing its future on.<br /><br />The distilled water that is out in some markets actually says distilled water on the back of the label.  If you are in possession of this water, you have an inferior product.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL OPINION<br /><br />I happen to be in possession of the original New Zealand water, the new US based spring water, as well as several competing brands: Hawaiian Springs and Mountain Valley Springs.<br /><br />Comparing them by taste and smell, my husband and I agree that this is how we would rate the four products.  1.) New Zealand water is the clear winner, it's a shame we no longer have the option to purchase it, 2.) The US based Eternal Water is our second choice, 3.) Hawaiian Springs is a close second to the US based Eternal Water, 4.) Mountain Valley Spring Water.  Note: Mountain Valley Spring water does contain some fluoride.

review/summary: Deceptive
review/text: DoNOT Buy this Water. This water used to be delicious but the have recently within the last 3 months started making changes to this water. Cheaper packaging and the water is no longer purchased from New Zealand it is actually now purchased in different parts of the US and they charge the same price at my local Whole Foods as if it was still from New Zealand. The water now tastes horrible....it tastes like it has sediment or contaminents in the water. I inquired about the change in the water and here is the email I rec'd: Although Eternal was previously sourced in New Zealand, there are many reasons for our decision to change to a US-based source. Your naturally alkaline spring source is nestled deep in the Great Smoky Mountains of Eastern Tennessee at the base of English Mountain.<br /><br />I am now searching for another water to drink. SMH!!!

review/summary: Somewhat misleading Amazon product title
review/text: This is NOT "Puppy food" -- that is to say, it is not branded or sold by NutriSource as quote-Puppy-unquote food.<br /><br />In fact, while large print on the package says "Adult Dogs," this food IS perfectly suitable for puppies; and NutriSource say this in the smaller print of the packaging. It's certainly not part of the branding: NutriSource do not currently make any such thing as "Grain Free Chicken" food specifically for puppies.<br /><br />That said -- this is the same food as the small bag (with, confusingly, a quite different-looking packaging) of kibble our breeder sent us home with when we adopted our little Havanese puppy.<br /><br />He loves it. He produces a nice stool and has never either been constipated or had diarrhea using this formula.<br /><br />So, hooray, a very good puppy food that is not "Puppy food."

review/text: I love this pistachio paste/cream. This brand was specifically called out in a recipe book that I have and I love it. I specifically bought it to make macarons, but used it in some buttercream frosting for cupcakes not too long ago and it was perfect for that as well. I also look forward to using it in homemade ice cream this summer. I don't think the price of the item is bad at all, although I do think the shipping seems a bit expensive, but, since I can't get anything like this where I live, it's worth it. : ) I also don't mind how much sugar is in this cream. I'm using specifically for baking, so that sugar content doesn't bother me.

I thought the price wasn't too bad compared to other pistachio pastes out there.  Definitely worth it for me.  Btw, I didn't have the problem as another reviewer did with the quantity in this product.

Not very nice, considering that I paid full price.<br /><br />The expiration date on matzohs is usually two years or longer, so these are at least three years old.<br /><br />Another example of caveat emptor.<br /><br />Before I order a product, I'd like to know if it is already past its expiration date. Is there a way that I can do that?

These are soft as an aside.  I would disagree though and not rate them "YUCK" as one reviewer has done here.  I can tell that the grade of white chocolate isn't quite the same as the cookies sold from their website for instance.  So, much better then "YUCK", I'm not disappointed at all but next time I want a box of their cookies I'll probably order from Mrs. Field's direct.

review/summary: Unfortunately, These Cookies Have NO Flavor and Are Tasteless
review/text: Unfortunately, zero stars not possible on here. I agree with the reviewer who said "yuck" (though I wouldn't put it as straightforwardly rude as that). When I saw these Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia cookies on here and saw some people thought they were good I just HAD to say something (and, check my record- I usually don't post reviews!)!  I bought 2boxes of these Mrs. Fields White Chunk Macadamia because I love Mrs. Fields- I adore her other cookies/wanted so much to love these!  However, the first bite of this White Chunk Macadamia cookie ruined that. The 1st box I bought from a local CVS store. They are totally bland and have virtually no flavor- even the white chocolate didn't have any flavor although the chunks were plentiful. Which is kinda unbelievable- as, white chocolate is supposed to make it even more flavorful (for example- Hershey's white chocolate bars and kisses taste, extremely flavorful/like chocolate). VERY DISAPPOINTED in this flavor of Mrs. Fields.  Since I love Mrs Fields Cookies (and, obviously, giving her the benefit of the doubt):  I thought, ok, maybe I got a bad box.  So, I bought another one from the Walgreens in Downtown Chicago. AND NOPE- THIS FLAVOR IS STANDARDLY BLAND AND TASTELESS.  The only good thing about these cookies were that both boxes were very fresh/cookies were indivially wrapped as advertised.  If only Mrs. Fields would've put as much thought into the actual cookie itself!! SO- IF YOU HAVE A TASTE FOR WHITE CHOCOLATE AND BUY THIS COOKIE PLEASE BE PREPARED TO HAVE 2THINGS ON HAND- BOTH WHICH ACTUALLY TASTES LIKE  WHITE CHOCOLATE, AND A REAL CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE!  HOW could a professional like Mrs. Fields get this so horribly wrong????  When it comes to sweets I'm easy to please- trust me (and, my scale can, at times, attest to that):  But, in this case THIS COOKIE NEEDS A REDO!!  I am convinced that the people who thought these even had a scintilla of taste either works for the company, or need tastebud transplants! I've been as honest as I can.  I wonder what Gordon Ramsay would say to Mrs. Fields upon sampling these white chunk Macadamia cookies???  Oh, the horror.

It would be cheaper just to walk into a store and buy the tubes individually.  The only reason that they didn't get 1 star, is that it's still Dubble Bubble and I've gotta give them something for that.

review/summary: Tasted GREAT!
review/text: These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.

Truffles have always been one of my favorites, but there is a huge difference between brands, types, etc - even in the so-called "home made" stores. One bite of these, and I was spoiled forever! (Personally, I'm buying the two pack so I can keep one and give the other as a gift --- hopefully! LOL)<br /><br />These seem to be seasonal, so if you are at all interested, be aware of this.

review/text: We received this product in about 2 days, really surprised. It has two bags in a box, the package is good, having no defects. As for the truffles, I should say they are perfect. We just can't help eating one and another one and......so delicious and sweet. I think I will buy again for my family and friends.
