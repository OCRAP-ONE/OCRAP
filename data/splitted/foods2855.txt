review/summary: Good quality, but pointy, pointy pieces
review/text: Overall, I'm pleased with the quality of these chews. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a number of the strips are cut in such a way that they have sharp slender points. I have 2 Springer Spaniel pups that love these things so much that they try to gulp them down without much chewing. I keep a close eye on my pups while they eat these chews to ensure that they don't get caught in their throats. We have had one get caught in the roof of the mouth. I sometimes smash the points with a hammer just for my own peace of mind. The dogs love 'em. I have to keep them in the laundry room because they can smell them (I can't) if I keep them in the kitchen which leads to begging and pawing.

review/summary: Dogs are happy, therefore I am happy :)
review/text: We own two dogs who are drastically different in sizes. I've always preferred the slivers because my smaller dog can manage them better, and I pick out the larger pieces for my bigger dog. I normally get them from the pet store but needed an extra item to add to my order to put it over 25 bucks ( yay for free shipping ). The price is cheaper here than I normally pay and my smaller dog, who is WAY more picky seems to like these better than the ones from the pet store we shop at. The size of the slivers are more constant as well. There are still some bigger than others but none of the tiny crumbs of pieces you can sometimes find in other brands.<br /><br />Overall if my dogs are happy with them, I am happy with them and they seem to be. Plus the price is great just another bonus.

review/summary: Bad Reaction
review/text: I have a Lab and a Boxer and got these for them since they love pig ears. After a couple of days they both got sick and had allergic reactions. Swelling, raw snouts - always rubbing on the ground - lethargic. So I went to the vet thinking they were sick from something else. She said the pig ears did it! Said she has seen this before with cheap ones. These were much greasier than local bought ones too. Too bad, it was a good price.

review/summary: Not what I wanted ... but exactly what was advertised
review/text: We have tiny dogs. The kind that fit in a woman's purse (sheeeeeze, that's what the wife wanted, grin) Anyway, we were looking for "slivers" of pig's ears not "slices". The slices are probably great for medium to large dogs, but they were too big for our tiny dogs.<br /><br />Good product for a fair price. Just think "Slices" not "Slivers".

review/summary: I love these for my small dog.
review/text: We have a Mini Schnauzer who loves these things.  These are great for dogs in which a full pigs ear is too much for one sitting.  I use these as a treat for my dog whenever I am going somewhere and she will have to stay in her cage.  These are always gone by the time I get home and she gets right in her cage without a fight because she knows she will get one.  I think these would be a huge waste for a medium to large dog as they would finish them so quickly.

review/text: YOU CAN GET A BETTER VALUE....<br /><br />I bought these thinking they were something they turned out to not be. I guess I wanted the regular sized pig ears that I am accustomed to.<br /><br />24 of these ears= about 8 regular sized Pig ears. That may be a generous ratio to give.<br /><br />So all in all in my opinion there are better deals for this type of item...<br /><br />So where do I get my dogs pig ears--<br /><br />ALDI grocery store--- they have a company "SHEP" that produces some dog items for that chain of stores.<br /><br />About $3 or $4 buys you 5 regular (LARGE) pig ears. A real great deal- dogs love them.

review/summary: Made in USA, but Very Sharp Pointy Edges
review/text: After reading the reviews here about made in China, I was pleased to find that they must have been mistaken, ..... that the product is clearly labeled, Made In USA.<br /><br />The product is fun for the dog, I have a 3 lb chihuahua, and he loves them.  They are varying sizes, I'm sure ANY size dog could enjoy them.  My worry is that they are VERY pointy - sharp as a knife.  I watch him very carefully.  I have also filed down some of the points with a commercial metal file.  That was an easier option for me than returning, no matter how easy Amazon returns are, I hate to have to return things.<br /><br />I see other Smokehouse products that I can try instead, so all in all I'm happy with the Manufacturer and the product quality.<br /><br />So, while I give the product 5 stars for flavor and appeal, being made in USA, quality fresh when received - I have to deduct 2 stars for having to file down points.<br /><br />For those that want a list of dog-treat/food Companies that are certified MADE IN USA, check this website: [...] and then find the area that is dog-made-in-the-usa.  On the left, they have two brand lists, the top list is for the USA page, refine by company, etc.  Click see more to see the entire list - - the ones they carry that are NOT made in the USA are grayed out.  NOT made in USA, those include Beefeaters and Busybuddy!!!!  - much to my surprise.  I could have sworn Beefeaters said it had it's facilities FDA and HACCP certified on their About Us on their website.  That would say to me that they are USA, but no where on their site does it actually state Made in USA, so hmmmm.  Guess it's good to investigate.

review/summary: Smelly+Crunchy=Puppy's favorite treat
review/text: Our 4-mo old terrier is teething so she really lives up to her breed's rep. I got these after reading the reviews on Amazon, and our pup loves them. She goes off by herself and gnaws on one strip for about 30-40 min. We can clean the house, do laundry in another room, and eat dinner in peace with these silvers. It's almost like magic!<br /><br />It is very greasy and there is definitely a smoky-sort of scent to these things. I think that's why she likes it. I hide a silver in one of her toys, and can leave the house without her even noticing that I'm gone. Highly recommended if your dog is teething, a terror (sorry, terrier!), and likes crunchy smelly treats!

The leaves and stems of tomato plants are the most toxic followed by unripe (green) tomatoes and ripe (red) tomatoes.<br />Walnuts & most nuts Walnuts are poisonous to dogs.

review/summary: Makes yummy croquettes for your family,too!
review/text: I grew up on croquettes. Salmon,mackerel,even the large Eatwell sardines all make a fine croquette. I hesitated trying these because all the reviews were for using it for dog food! These are quite good. Actually delicious. Add bread crumbs, onion powder,garlic powder and a little seafood seasoning and voila! Breakfast, lunch or dinner is served. Yes, in the south we have them with biscuits for breakfast. For lunch or dinner serve with rice and your favorite green veggie. Do not bother removing the bones. If you mash the fish with a fork before forming into croquettes, they practically disappear and gives you a boost of calcium. So give your dog a can or two but save the rest for your family.  The usual condiments work well with this fish. Tartar sauce,cocktail sauce and my favorite malt vinegar. Bon Appetit. P.S. Do not forget to add an egg to bind your croquettes. Otherwise the croquettes will fall apart when you fry them.

review/summary: Not a Bad Product....
review/text: Perhaps the previous reviewer got a bad case but I bought 2 cases for my dogs to eat and from my experience this is a very acceptable product.  Both cases arrived in perfect condition.  Mackerel isn't my favorite fragrance but it was not spoiled or bad in any way.  The dogs thought it was fabulous and apart from some smelly fish breathe for a few hours there was certainly no ill effects.

review/summary: Excellent Value, great shipping
review/text: I purchased this mackerel for one of my dogs who is on a homemade diet due to allergies. Compared to the Bumblebee brand I was purchasing at WalMart, the fish in the can are smaller and there seems to be more water used in processing, but it's just as easy to break up and measure out for her meals, so I appreciate the savings and the convenience of having such a large quantity delivered to my doorstep. Marley (my dog) loves this mackerel just as much as the other brand and has maintained and perhaps even gained a little weight since switching, so the nutritional value seems to be the same.<br /><br />I used the "supersaver" shipping and it came in just a few days via FedEx - much faster than any books I've had delivered by that method.

review/summary: Surprisingly Tasty
review/text: My Japanese grandma drinks a homemade mix of apple cider vinegar and bananas for health and this drink is black, pungent and quite frightening. HongCho vinegreat is a great alternative and actually tastes really good! Don't let the "vinegar" scare you off - it is really quite sweet and you just get a little hit of the tang going down. I guess it really depends on how much you dilute it. I believe the package says 1:3 for a strong taste or 1:4 or 1:5 for a lighter taste. I've tried both the Pomegranate and Blueberry flavors and they were both good. You can also mix the concentrate with milk, yogurt or even make a salad dressing out of it.<br /><br />The bottle recommends drinking after a work out, after a bath or before bed. The purported benefits of drinking vinegar including overall well being, improvement in digestion, speeding up metabolism and skin benefits. I've only been drinking this for a short time so I can't really say if I've noticed any difference in health.<br /><br />As far as the Amazon price, I got a smokin deal at my local H Mart and picked up a bottle for only $6. The regular price is $10/bottle so the Amazon price isn't too bad, especially if you don't have a Korean grocery store nearby.

review/text: Being French I grew up knowing how important it was to use a good unrefined salt. The one from Brittany being the very best. No! It's not foolish to spent money on a  basic spice.

review/text: Not really sure if I can describe this salt properly. Yes, it has a wonderful flavor without too much of a salty flavor. It's very clean tasting. Mostly, though, I think it seems "creamy". Yea, I know that sounds weird, but the moisture with the salt gives it a creamy-salty embodiment. I use this for special dishes to add a delectable flavor to a dish...also knowing that I'm serving food with a healthy salt with tons of minerals.

review/text: I got into salts, the more I learned to cook.  Firstly all salt is salt,  but different textures appeal differently on your palate.  They seem so anyway.  Now the darker shades of salt do have different minerals, depending where they're from.  You need to be careful though , remember these gourmet salts do not have iodine, so make sure you continue to use table salt, though it is hard to do so.  Love this salt on salads and steak,  trust me.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I never realized this, but the salt and mineral concentration of seawater is different in each part of the world, and therefore the taste of sea salt varies based on where it comes from.<br /><br />To me, "French gray" sea salt is delicious - the flavor is more gentile than regular salt and has a slightly tangy taste with just a hint of minerals.  The price may seem high compared to table salt, but Amazon's price is low compared to other places I've bought it. Definitely worth it, in my opinion.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this sea salt is very moist, so it doesn't work well in a grinder or shaker.  Sometimes I'll serve it in a salt cellar, but generally I just keep it in a glass jar by the stove for cooking and use regular salt at the table.

Actually, it was the looseleaf chai from the same company that stained my teeth, and my pot, and my mugs, and my spatula, and everything else it touched, but that's another story...<br /><br />So I thought I'd try green tea.  But it turns out I don't really like the taste of green tea, so I drink this.  It provides a small amount of caffeine and tastes yummy - a lot of citrus and lemongrass flavor.  It tastes more like an herbal tea than a green tea, so if you're looking for green-tea flavor, look elsewhere.

review/summary: decades later finally have another chew
review/text: I thought this gum died out in the 80s/early 90s. Almost all the gum sold in stores today is laced with aspertame (which imo rots your brain). I refuse to even chew a single piece of gum with that garbage in it.<br /><br />OK, so freshen-up isn't exactly devoid of bad stuff either - red #40, BHT and of course, the catch-all, "artificial flavoring" - which could be anything. Oh, and strangely, i notice it says it contains sulfites? hummm...<br /><br />Thanks to the internet, people can still fulfill a long tail niche for stuff we want.<br /><br />I was thrilled to find amazon and other places sell Freshen-up gum which is still made the same way - with good old fashioned rot-your-teeth sugar.  The Cadbury/Adams mfr says it's made in Brazil now and the box says �2004. So I'm assuming this gum I got in 2011 is 7 years old.<br /><br />However, gum doesn't go bad very quickly when sealed - at least in this case.  If this gum is really that old.<br />I read another review mentioned they felt the gum was stale.  The batch I got seems fine to me.<br /><br />It still is soft and the liquid center is what made this gum unique.<br /><br />Bubble blowing tip:<br />If you chew 2 pieces at a time, it makes for some decent bubble blowing - although, this can be a bad idea as an adult male... Facial hair wasn't an issue as a kid, but now ya need to be clean shaven unless you want to experience what women go through when they wax, lol.<br /><br />SUMMARY - happy with the gum. Would buy again.  I will likely buy spearmint and/or peppermint next time to see how those stand up to memory.

review/text: I am a college student and instant noodles are like the life line for everyone. I normally eat the small cup noodles (shrimp flavor) but I bought a pack of these because I felt that the normal cup noodles were too little and repetitive. At first I was not a big fan of the spicy flavor, but when I ate my second cup I realized how much more filling and better it was compared to the cup noodles. I mean sure they are like 2-3 times more expensive, but they are like 1.5-2 servings. Just be warned though, they are like a day's worth of sodium in each one. I never have these as a meal replacement, but just a midnight snack when I'm up studying. The spice also helps keep my awake which is a plus. I cant wait to try out some of the other flavors they have to offer. Definitely a must to have a pack of these in the house sitting around.

review/summary: small cup > big bags
review/text: I absolutely love the 2.64 oz version of Shin, my favorite junk food fix. For those that think it's the same as the big bags, it's not. There are large dried mushroom flakes in here and the dried green onions are also larger and fresher looking than the ones in the large bags. The noodles are slightly thinner and potentially less soggier. I also like the size much better. 4.2 is way too large for ramen and it's a 1.5 servings. I eat the cheaper 3oz bags sometimes because of the inconvenient 4.2 size. I sometimes don't bother making the large shin if I'm alone because I don't want to waste the rest of it especial if I put eggs and veggies in there, so I'll make it if someone else is eating it with me as I can make 2 bags for 3 people or if it's with someone that can eat 1.5 bags. Since this is junk food, I don't think it makes sense to do the economic math anyway, but it's not even that much more expensive than the large bags. Even if the large ones are 4.2oz and cost just $0.20 more per bag, if I have to waste the rest of it I'm not saving money but rather wasting it. Plus it's not like rice where you can save it and reheat it, so I always flush it down the toilet if I can't finish it, so I'm not just wasting the noodles but also the eggs and veggies and sausages. I wish they have more small-sized tasty ramen options. This is why Americans are fat.

This cup noodle tastes better than the shin big bowl (the flavor is different), and tastes different from the bagged shin ramyun. But, it just tastes delicious. The mushroom flavor is noticeable and adds depth to the already complex flavor of the spices. WOW!<br /><br />I gave a couple to starving coworkers and they have been scouring the town for this ever since (the supermarkets here only have the nongshim bowl noodles) which they already like. I told them to get it from amazon but they are internet-shy. Their loss!<br /><br />This is by far the most delicious cup noodle ever. Ever!

review/summary: Great ramen noodle
review/text: This is really spicy but totally worth it. The dried mushroom flakes makes it healthier (?) than other ramen on the market. What I like most about it is it only contains 330 calories per cup, which is acceptable for someone who's watching her weight. And I believe the spice in it can help lose weight (well according to my mom).<br /><br />It has the right amount for my occasional spicy ramen cravings late at night, esp. when I'm studying for a test. The spicy soup can keep me awake even w/t coffee. Recommend to every college student!

review/summary: The Nongshim Shim noodles are great for college snacks!
review/text: The save and subscribe feature by Amazon is great for parents and grandparents who send "goodies" to their college kids.  My granddaughter is a freshman and loves receiving her favorite foods - sent to her automatically by Amazon.  She has always loved this Nongshim Shin Noodle Cup and gets to enjoy them in Mississippi.  She tells me that one of the reasons she likes the Shin noodle cup is because she can make it as spicy or non-spicy by the amount of ingredient in the packet she puts in the cup, which then only requires hot water!

review/text: I'm a little dissapointed that they changed the cups material to paper.  I'm sure its a little more environmentally friendly but probably just cheaper for the US maker.  Oh well, I tried and loved these a few years back and at least the flavor hasn't changed.  Still great... but -1 star for changing cup materials... the styrofoam ones insulated a lot better.

review/text: I should have read the other reviews before ordering. No where in the description (maybe I missed it) did it say it was SPICY. I ordered this for my son and he said even using 1/2 the seasoning packet it is too HOT! Rather than waste the noodles, he makes his own soup broth, from the other reviews prob. a healthier choice anyways.

review/summary: NOT MICROWAVE SAFE
review/text: I love the Shin Ramyun flavor of ramen, and bought these because, unlike the bowls, the description for these said "Boil or microwavable," and I assumed that meant you can either pour in boiling water, or pour water in and then microwave it.  This is NOT the case.<br /><br />I recommend getting the 4.2 ounce packages, as that is the more cost effective way to do it.  As always, keep an eye open for coupon codes or subscribe and save discounts.  Maybe check the googles.

review/summary: Good flavor for a decaf
review/text: My wife and I made the switch to fair trade coffee recently and set about looking for a good coffee pod for our Senseo at a fair price.  My doctor recently advised me to cut down on the caffeine, so our search included decaf coffee pods.  We weren't optimistic.  However, we tried Baronet Coffee Fair Trade Organic (!) Decaf Small Village Blend and found it to be a really flavorful cup of coffee. It was a pleasant surprise to find a decaf pod that rivaled "real" coffee in taste. If I have a second cup of coffee in the morning, it is brewed with this pod.

review/text: Not much to review except it's the usual Carnation in the delicious strawberry flavor that I drank as a kid. It seems all the strawberry available in the stores these days is in a mixed/variety package and only 2-3 packets of this flavor are put in the usual 10-packet variety box along with 4-5 packets of 2 different chocolate flavors. After searching a half dozen grocery stores for the strawberry only box, I gave up and turned to Amazon, which thankfully stocked it. I'll be ordering more soon. Cheers to Amazon. (note: this item requires 3 boxes--so minimum order appears to be 30 strawberry packets for the $12-13 price.)

review/summary: Delicious, hard-to-find product
review/text: I'm glad to see these on Amazon. I scour the grocery stores for the strawberry flavor, but it's hard to find. Most times, if they have it at all, it's part of a variety pack. I just want the strawberry. I've gone so far as to order them directly from the manufacturer.<br /><br />The flavor of these is great. I'm not a big breakfast person, and most breakfast foods are heavy and greasy. Eggs get boring after a while, but strawberry instant breakfast is always a treat. It's quick to make and easy to take along if you want - just put it in a travel mug. It has vitamins and minerals and great taste. I mix it with organic whole milk and I'm set until lunch time. I've used it for years when I'm on a diet - the taste is something to look forward to, it gives me a little boost, and it's so quick that it keeps me out of the kitchen.

It tastes exactly like strawberry milk and it's a great breakfast substitute for anyone who would normally rather skip that meal. I've also heard it's great for getting more nutrients and calories in children that don't like to drink milk or eat much.

review/text: If you're one of those people who doesn't like to do breakfast, but you don't want to suffer the lack of energy skipping breakfast brings - this product just might be the solution?  It's worth a shot.  Of the flavors, Strawberry is the best - my opinion - and I purchase the vanilla as an alternative so that I don't tire of just the one choice.  Your tastes may differ so you might want to start with the Variety package???

review/text: My 10 y.o. daughter is a very picky eater and could never hold down breakfast in the morning.  It makes her nauseous.  I tried this after a recommendation from her doctor and was pleased to find out she loves it.  It is really difficult to find in stores and Amazon's price is great.  I mix it with whole milk to boost the fat content, since my daughter has trouble putting on weight with her lack of appetite lately.  Breakfast is no longer a chore.  Everyone can enjoy this and its easy enough that she can make it herself.  I love the fact that it also has protein, vitamins and iron, since this is so important for growing kids.  Thank you to Carnation for making such a great product and Amazon for stocking it.
