review/summary: Price Gauging on small piece of German chocolate
review/text: While German chocolate tastes very good, I grew up with it, charging $4.99 for this is pretty lame, yes I did read the description and bought it, however this store or seller is taking it from the living, in other words, I don't think I come back to buy, to expensive!

review/summary: Not sold on the East Coast
review/text: We had to order these online because they don't sell these type of Cheetos on the East Coast. We had them while living in Arizona and they were my son's favorite so I decided to give him a surprise and order these. They were fresh and great as usual. Everyone else who ate them loved them. Too bad they don't sell them on the East Coast.

review/summary: Too much Lime
review/text: I bought a bunch of small bags of this thinking that I would love it since I love Flamin' Hot Cheetos. Boy was I wrong. They taste really good at first but after 3 or 4 bites the Lime is tooooooo overpowering and it completely ruins the taste. I think Frito Lay may want to stick to other flavors aside from this one. I'm addicted to the Flamin' Hot flavor of their products but they just don't have it on this one. Too much lime just ruins the taste.

review/summary: Good, but save your money.
review/text: Purchased this kit about 2 months ago and finished bottling it about a week ago.  It's quite delicious, however a cheaper alternative is the Valpolicella style wine from Vino Italiano.  Both are made from Paklab and in my opinion at this stage of consumption there is little difference between the two.  I actually timed a Valpolicella kit to finish the exact day as the Amarone kit for better comparison.  I'm also going to time the consumption in sync as to see if one ages better than the other.<br /><br />In closing at this stage, I find the Chateau Classico Amarone kit to be good, but not worth the extra cost above the Vino Italiano Valpolicella wine kit knowing both products are from Paklab.  We'll just have to see what the future holds.

review/summary: Chateau
review/text: This was (is) the first Chateau kit I bought. A bit more complicated then the description indicates. I've alerady made at least 20 different wine kits which were easier and 40 beer kits. Also which was not mentioned it should be fermented (and after bottling should be stored) in 55 degree enviroment (a year?) other wise I would not bought it. Maybe another variety if it could be fermented and stored at normal temps but hot this flavor. It is similiar to fermenting Lager at 55. I'm not going to build a special cooling room or buy a referigator just to do a batch or two of beer or wine!  As it is I can't comment on its taste yet give me a year on that.

review/text: Jam in a Jiffy is SO easy to use and SO delicious!  It literally takes 5 minutes to make homemade jam.  I love it because you can use any soft fruit or make a combination.  My favorite is strawberry mango.  I would suggest crushing up the fruit, stirring in the mix to see how the jam sets up.  Then if it needs the extra half cup of water add it.  I guess some fruit looses water as it sits in the fridge :)

However, my continuing purchases depend on not just quality but price. We'll see.

I ordered this variant because it was labeled as "HOT", when it really should be labeled "SWEET"; there wasn't even a hint of spice in the squid i received.<br /><br />Now, the taste;<br />The taste of this product is VERY similar to fish, only a bit sweeter. It's not awful by any means, but it's not something i would find myself ever wanting again(i am not a fish kind of guy btw).<br /><br />The real deal breaker is the price. The package has VERY little squid, and it cost close to 10 dollars for the package after shipping. Shipping was properly speedy, though.<br /><br />If you really want dry squid, check your local markets and see if they have some variants; don't waste money on shipping it to your home.

review/summary: Cheap, nutritional, but not vegan.
review/text: I was shopping around for nutritional yeast, and based on the price and the reviews I found online, I decided to go with this brand.  It is definitely packed with nutrients and is a great source of many vitamins and minerals.  It's flavor is good, although this is the first nutritional yeast I've bought, so I can't compare it to other brands.  The smell upon first opening the jar seemed a bit strong, but it wasn't as bad after using it and opening/closing the jar a few times.<br /><br />I am mostly writing this review to let other potential customers know that this product is NOT VEGAN.  I guess everyone defines veganism a little differently, but this nutritional yeast contains whey from milk, so if you don't want to eat dairy, or can't for some health reason, you should be aware of that before you purchase it.  I will quote the ingredients list from another website:<br /><br />"Other Ingredients: Nutritional yeast, calcium carbonate, whey (from milk), magnesium carbonate, potassium phosphate monobasic, choline bitartrate, niacinamide, potassium chloride, d-calcium pantothenate, para aminobenzoic acid, bromelain, GTF chromium yeast, inositol, cyanocobalamin, ferrous sulfate, selenium yeast, papain, pyridoxine hydrochloride, thiamin mononitrate, riboflavin, sodium chloride, zinc sulfate, manganese sulfate, biotin, folic aicd, potassium iodide."<br /><br />This is the same as what is on my jars' labels.  You can get the entire nutritional facts and ingredients from the Twinlab website [...]  It's a nice product at a reasonable price in a large quantity.  In fact, it's going to take me a while to go through two pounds of it (how much yeast can a guy eat?).  When I finally do finish it, I won't be ordering again due to the dairy, but if that doesn't bother you, I would actually recommend this product as it seems to be a good deal.  I gave it four stars because the dairy thing was really my fault.  I should have done some more research of my own.<br /><br />Happy shopping.

review/summary: Power-Packed Nurtition
review/text: Brewers yeast is loaded with many essential nutrients.  It is packed with nutrition.  I especially love this Yeast Plus product as it is even more loaded with vitamins and minerals.  Brewers yeast is not something to write home about as far as taste goes.  So, I mix a heaping tablespoon into my smoothie every time I make one which is several times a week.  That covers up the taste.  I especially take this product because it is loaded with B vitamins and potassium.  Though brewers yeast is not great tasting, another advantage of this product over others is that it seems to have a much milder flavor.  Sure, it's not ice cream, but it will do a whole lot more to benefit your health and well-being.

review/summary: Best Strawberry Cereal on the Market
review/text: My wife and I love strawberry cereals. We have tried every single strawberry cereal with flakes on the market. Our favorite used to be 'Kellogg's Special K Red Berries' cereal but after trying 'FlaxPlus Red Berry Crunch' by Nature's Path, we our hooked! There are a number of things that make this cereal great. First is the abundance of berries: strawberries and raspberries. Now I am not a huge fan of raspberries but the combination with the strawberries really enhances the flavor. I really enjoy the fact that it's not just flakes but also oats and flax seeds. It really gives a more wholesome and full taste.<br /><br />So not only does this cereal taste great, but it's also certified organic. We also tried another organic cereal by Kashi called Strawberry Fields. We still prefer FlaxPlus Red Berry Crunch because the Kashi cereal's flakes are just too crunchy and don't absorb milk really well. It makes the whole cereal much too crunchy, plus it doesn't taste as "full" as Nature's Path because it just has flakes and not the added bonus of oats and multiple grains including: whole wheat meal, rolled oats, wheat bran, brown rice flour, oat bran, etc.

I will have to buy the others here at a slightly higher price because No Others were available from Costco. Worth the cost at either place.<br /><br />UPDATE: As of about 12/1/09 Costco no longer has this brand, I bought some of the last double packs of the Red Berry Crunch for $3.97, 26 ozs. IT WAS GOOD! No More Left. Amazon probably has the next best price. I did not see this one at Trader Joe's.

review/summary: Great tasting cereal that will fill you up in the morning
review/text: I have a dairy allergy, so finding cereals without dairy can be a pain. I tried out this cereal at Costco and loved it. I have GERD that I can manage through my diet and without medication. This cereal really helps soak up any acid in my stomach and keeps me from getting hungry until lunch time. Also, this cereal tastes GREAT with Silk Vanilla flavored soy milk. The berrys soak up the soy milk well and the cereal can be kept crunchy or soggy depending on how much soy milk you put in. I eat this cereal every single day. It doesn't get better than a breakfast that tastes this good and is this filling for a dollar and a half a bowl(I eat half a box in a bowl).<br /><br />I have tried their other cereal that has raisins in it, and they are REALLY hard! Even soaking them in soy milk doesn't help much. After reading the other cereals reviews, I know this one is the best that Nature's Path makes.

review/summary: Affordable and Delicious
review/text: My husband and I decided to try some new cereals this week.  He selected "Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Red Berry Crunch" cereal and I selected "Yogi Cherry Almond Crunch" cereal because I love cherries and wanted to try a cereal with cherries.<br /><br />The "Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Red Berry Crunch" cereal was flavorful, delicious, and it had plenty of pieces of organic strawberries and organic raspberries.  My husband and I both LOVED it.  It was also a good buy; we paid $6.00 for two 10.6 oz. boxes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I neglected to read the ingredients on the box of "Yogi Cherry Almond Crunch" cereal. Because the word CHERRY was the largest word on the box, I mistakenly assumed that cherries were in the cereal.  Cherries are not in this cereal.  When you read the ingredients you will find "cherry power" listed as the last ingredient.  I was disappointed when I poured a bowl of this expensive cereal and could not find any evidence of cherries anywhere.  Curious, I poured out the entire 12 ounces of cereal and carefully inspected the contents.  I was able to find three individual cereal flakes with a fair amount of red "cherry powder" on them, and one flake that had a minuscule speck of red.  I'm not lying---this cereal could be "buy one box and get nine boxes for free" in a store and I would pass on it.  To add insult to injury, the 12 oz. box cost almost $5.00.<br /><br />Eat "Nature's Path Organic Flax Plus Red Berry Crunch" cereal for breakfast; don't start your day with a big advertisement lie.

review/summary: Good Cereal; Used to be BETTER
review/text: They changed the formulation/texture of this cereal within the last two years.  When I first had it, I also got it from a "big-box" store and got hooked.  Stopped eating it for a while when I started traveling for work frequently, and just recently bought another batch.  The old formulation was a bit crunchier, the strawberries were sliced differently (they're more like a dice now), and it didn't have the little white puffs in it.<br /><br />That said, from a flavor perspective, it's still one of my favorite cereals for the mix of tartness (from the strawberries) and the hint of sweetness (not overpowering).  Perhaps more importantly, for some odd reason, Nature's Path cereals -- and in particular this one -- are the only cold cereals that actually fill me up.  I alternate randomly between this cereal and a breakfast sandwich of 2 slices of whole wheat toast + 1 egg + 1 slice of cheese + 2 slices of ham.  Surprisingly, they both hold me over about the same amount of time until I start to feel the need for a snack before lunch.<br /><br />Not a bad choice if you need something that you can eat quickly and get going.  Heartily recommended, even with the new formulation.

A bowl a day does the trick and cuts down on some of the junk I would otherwise eat.  Sometimes I cheat from the civilized bowl, milk and sliced banana approach and simply fill a baggie with two or three handfuls that i munch like a snack ...even on the run. I'm a fan and I think my wife even sneaks some when I'm not looking.

review/text: If this cereal had at least double the fiber it would be an almost perfect cereal, it's organic, has flax, etc. Unfortunately 5 grams of fiber per serving is not nearly enough when you consider the average adult should get 35-40 grams per day. I mix it 50/50 with a much higher fiber content cereal and add some raisons for taste. 5 stars for taste, 2 stars for fiber content.

review/text: At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  "real"beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee.

review/summary: Healing Cancer
review/text: This stuff works!!  I was diagnosed almost 3 years ago with a form of Uterine cancer that is very rare and was told I had a 15% chance of survival.  The chemo stopped the tumor's growth (at the time 5 inches).  But it wasn't until I began drinking this tea that it began to SHRINK!  It is now at 1 and a quarter inch and so far has not regrown.  If you have cancer or know someone who does, I HIGHLY recommend this tea!  Get it!  It takes time to prepare, but is SO worth it.  A nice warm, woodsy flavor, not bitter.  You can drink it hot or cold.  I nuke mine and have from the beginning.  No concerns.  My oncologist was FLOORED by the results of this tea after she took me off chemo due to heart damage.<br />Follow the directions on the bag and you'll be fine.  Put it in a dark container, though.  Light sensitive.  A friend of mine uses washed out milk cartons.  :)

I prefer to make our lemonade in a pitcher as opposed to individual glasses, and I have found that adding a little more water makes the lemonade less tart (we add 3 quarts of water to one pouch of lemonade mix).<br /><br />Add in the savings and convenience of Amazon's "Subscribe and Save" option, and Fruit Blooms Organic Lemonade gets a big thumbs-up in our household!

I was then looking for popcorn on Amazon and actually linked to this lemonade. After reading reviews I thought I'd give it a try. It turned out to be the best flavored drink mix I have ever had.<br /><br />I mix a 2 quart pitcher and then I slice up a lemon and squeeze the juice into as I mix it. We just had a BBQ this past weekend and I made a couple of pitchers of it and I was asked how I make my fresh squeezed lemonade. It doesn't have a chemical taste to it at all. I was really pleased with it. It mixed up quickly and you don't get that sludge at the bottom of the pitcher like some mixes.

review/text: The Lemonade flavor is excellent.  I like to make it a bit on the strong side, by putting over half of an entire package into a 64 oz "Super Big Gulp" sized container, instead of using the package to make 80 oz of the drink.  Add ice, and you have the best tasting Lemonade on planet earth, and enough of it to last the entire day.  The package could be made simpler to open, but since I started to put over one half of the entire package in a giant container, it does not matter to me any more.  Just cut the top off with your kitchen scissors.  I add a couple teaspoons of an algae/ veggie/ mineral product to the drink, and o-m-g it is the best tasting way I found to get my daily veggies and minerals.

( it takes 2/3 of a pouch) and the package gives you leftovers doing it this way.  the good news is that you get 12 pouches which makes it ever more portable than a big tube drink mix like koolaid.

review/text: I had this on subscription so I know I ordered the same stuff before. What I got the second time was exact same except all it said was All Natural (without certified organic) on it. There was one more ingredient Silicone Dioxide (non-caking agent according to the packaging). From what I have read Silicone Dioxide can happen naturally AND it can be made synthetically. Who knows which is which. This USED to be my favorite, now I am not sure anymore.

review/text: This lemonade definitely tastes more like chemicals than real lemonade (a product like Simply Lemonade from the grocery store) does.  One reason might be that despite the organic name, there are unnecessary chemicals added simply to make it cloudy.  My other criticism of this product is that the size of it is awkward -- each pouch makes 1/2 gallon plus one glass, so you either always have a little bit left over, or you have to make it in a gallon pitcher that is almost half empty.

review/summary: AWFUL!!! AWFUL!!!
review/text: This product is a perfect example for the erroneous notion that the label of "all natural" or "organic" is of higher quality and therefore of good taste.  It seems to me that the makers have not really put much effort into this product.  Before purchasing I looked everywhere on-line  for the ingredients label and could not find it anywhere.  Here it is folks!: Sugar* (evaporated Cane Juice), Citric Acid (provides tartness), Natural Lemon Flavor, Natural Cloud (Maltrodextrin*, High Oleic Sunflower Oil*, Silicon Dioxide), Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C). Everything with the (*) are the organic ingredients. Not a very good list I may add.<br /><br />Sorry to say this, but who ever is giving this product any good review for taste must be either working for Fruit Blooms or has numb taste buds. To describe the taste:  after initially adding two level table spoons to 8fl oz. of water as suggested, the taste was rather flat.  After adding one more table spoon I couldn't help but be reminded of chewable vitamin C tablets which is far from how lemonade should taste.  Fruit Bloom...Get to work!!!

review/text: I purchase this coffee regularly to donate to an urban soup kitchen in the fall and winter. No brand I've found comes close to the price, especially when there's a discount with $49 (or whatever) purchase. I can't speak to the taste, as I'm not a coffee drinker, but our homeless clients are full of praise since we added coffee to the day's menu. While the homeless and indigent have plenty to complain about in their lives, they have yet to complain about the coffee. Having the coffee in vacuum packs really helps the original freshly-opened flavor to be there when we get to the 12th pack.

review/summary: Excellent Bags of High Quality
review/text: I love these bags. I have both long and short handle ones from this seller. They are very well made. I will be ordering long handled ones next as I only have one long handled one now. I am so glad I ordered these as they are all cotton and you cannot see through the bottom of them like the ones the stores sell.<br /><br />There is a little hook on both sides of the bag for the rack in the grocery store. You do not have to turn the bag around and make sure you hook the right side because there is one on both sides. Very handy. The size is the same size as a paper bag, which is just right. I would not want to carry a large bag, but I am an older person and she does have large bags for those would would want to fill up a large one.<br /><br />They are not too heavy of canvas, and I think it is just right because you do not notice the bag weight when it is full. The handles are so convienent and comfortable to carry your groceries in.<br /><br />Now if I can remember every time to bring them in the store with me, I'll have it made :-)  I am still new with these bags. The other day I forgot and when I was checking out, I realized I was on a meat buying run, so maybe it was a good thing to forget the bags. I was thinking at the check out that the meat would leak in the bags.<br /><br />The seller is so easy to work with and shipped very fast too. All around these are well made bags of the right weight and functionality.

review/summary: Best Canvas Bags! :)
review/text: I had been looking for well-constructed, canvas grocery bags made in the USA and I couldn't have asked for better!  I have used mine on several shopping trips.  They stay clean and each bag appears to hold at least double the same quantity that the old plastic grocery bags held.  This means less trips and overall less waste.  The convenient green handles make them easy to carry.<br />I don't know for certain if the plastic grocery bags will go extinct, either by law or extra grocer's fees, but I believe this is a small way that I can help keep more plastic from getting into our environment.  Thanks for these terrific bags that help me do my part!

review/summary: Short handles!  (I mean this is a good thing)
review/text: I've tried several different re-usable bags that I bought at local supermarkets but they all had the same problem - the handles were too long.  When I carried them by hand I had to lean my body to one side to prevent the bag from dragging on the ground and then the bag kept banging into my feet.  If I used the long handles over my shoulder; I could only fill it halfway or less.<br /><br />The Turtlecreek bags are the same size/shape as the large paper bags at the supermarket and they come with short handles.  I can carry two or more at a time (just like I did with plastic bags).  They hold a lot more than the disposable bags and they're a lot stronger.  When full, they fit nicely into the cart and my car - just like paper bags.<br /><br />When empty, they fold flat and don't take up much room in the car.  I keep a pair in the foot well of the front passenger seat and haven't forgotten them yet since Seattle banned plastic bags a few weeks back.  They've also come in handy for other occasions.  It turns out that always having bags in the car is a smart idea.  I'm very happy with these bags.

review/text: Every 5lb bag of whole beans I've bought off of amazon has been tasty and worthy of 5 stars (even outside of subjective preference, they are GOOD coffees, if maybe roasted too dark or too light for my tastes, etc). This product defied that standard. The beans were dry and dusty. Many of them were broken into smaller pieces already, and the coffee brewed is distinctively "bad." I suspect that my 5lb bag may have been old stock, but it was a huge dissapointment. I soldiered through the last cup today and felt compelled to prevent others from making the same mistake I did.

review/summary: Review of Copper Moon
review/text: Never did business with (or heard of) Cooper Moon before this order.  I was mousing around Amazon and found a very good deal (sale/mark down) on a 5 lb lot of freshly roasted coffee beans (Panama Boquete) -- which is why I was motivated to take a chance on an unknown (to me) company.  Since they advertise and sell product on Amazon, it wasn't the same (again, to my way of thinking) as going on eBay and buying product from an unknown vendor (I do that too, but that's another story). Plus free shipping. I no longer order coffee from anybody that charges me the full rate for shipping! It has to be a low flat rate or free shipping!  My wife and I are hearty coffee drinkers (it is our beverage of choice) and although I buy at least 5 lbs at a time we probably order 10-20 times per year (according to my shipping history with various vendors).  If you multiply that by $10.00 up to $15.00 (UPS) depending on the size of the shipment, the coin you save can surely buy either something else, or more coffee!<br /><br />Anyway, I ordered, and 6 days later beans were delivered by UPS.  Everything was in great shape. The bags had proper ventilation (small gas vent near upper middle of coffee bag).  Since Amazon shipped it, the coffee bags were well packed with box filler adding extra padding to the beans.  When I opened up the bags the smell of fresh roast coffee was wonderful.  Store bought cans or bags smell okay when you open them for the first time, but freshly roasted coffee perfumes the entire kitchen with an aroma of spice, berries and the smoke characteristics of the roaster that did the cooking and the varietal (type) of coffee bean purchased. In this case the PB beans had a city roast and they had a light citrus tang that really lends to the flavor of the coffee.<br /><br />Of course the proof of good coffee is in the tasting.  I made a pot. Poured a cup. (slurp!).  Great stuff. Panama Boquete is a hearty coffee with complex flavors (berries, earth, a little chocolate and citrus) and a deep, smooth finish.<br /><br />I have nothing critical to say.  I got a great deal with free shipping; beans arrived in the alloted window of time and were freshly roasted.  Copper Moon and Amazon get a top score.

review/summary: Not a Panama Boquete. A blend.
review/text: I've tried numerous varietal coffees including other Panama Boquetes sold here at Amazon. When I order a coffee that is listed or described as a varietal, that is what I expect. Though it is not (yet) mentioned in the title or description for this coffee, potential buyers should be aware that this coffee from Copper Moon is not a Panama Boquete varietal but is instead a blend of of some undisclosed portion of Panama Boquete beans with other undisclosed varieties of coffee beans.<br /><br />The distinction between a varietal and a blend is not a small one. There is nothing wrong with a blended coffee per se, but it should be disclosed. This coffee should be listed as a Panama Boquete blend, and not as "Panama Boquete Coffee." If you're looking to try a true Panama Boquete, look to some of the other whole bean listings here at Amazon. Don't judge the potential of a Panama Boquete based on a blend. Try the real deal so you have a  baseline on which to judge the blend.<br /><br />What's in the bag? Five pounds of unevenly roasted beans of various origins, sizes and qualities in what is overall a very light roast. There is some portion of Panama Boquete which is recognizable due to the characteristically small, distinctive beans of this varietal, but based on the condition of the beans, I would be hard pressed to describe even that portion of this blend as first quality. The unknown varieties which fill out the remaining 60 to 80 percent of this five pound bag are not of consistent size or roast and appear to be of generally average quality.  In comparison to other whole beans coffees I have purchased at Amazon, there is what seems like a high proportion of broken beans, at least in the five pound bag I received.<br /><br />Due to the fact that the product I received is not the product I expected, I don't know that I can fairly rate this coffee or the results in the cup, so consider my three stars to be neutral.

As a side note, they did not hold up well in the shipping process, about 1/4 of the packages were crumbs.  The box had been ripped open, smashed, and was held together by two large rubber bands.

review/summary: horrible quality, cheap material!
review/text: DO NOT BUY!!!<br /><br />This case broke apart in a month of use.  Also the colors came off after a week.<br />I've never drop it or anything but it just "self-destructed".<br />Paid $8.63 ($5.04 + $3.59 shipping) but the product worths NOTHING!!!<br />Save yourself some trouble and move on on your search.

review/summary: Picnic for Two
review/text: I bought this picnic basket as a gift for my husband's birthday.  The contents were very tasty and the flavors blended wonderfully with the Shiraz Cabernet wine I bought to go with it.  The only drawback we had was that there was no handle on the basket, so we had to carry it under our arm from the car to the picnic spot we chose.  Overall, this was one of my husband's best birthday's...his words!

review/summary: Girlfriend loved it, missing some items though
review/text: EDIT: Just realized some of the items promised are missing... Disappointing.<br /><br />Gave this gift to my girlfriend, she loved it. Has all the items listed, reasonable price, all the contents are in good condition. The main downside was that it took almost a week for the seller to ship the order. Once shipped, it arrived fairly quickly, though. Also, the bottom of the box is falling apart, & the inside of the mug appears to be dirty. Overall, I'm satisfied. Quality and customer service just needs to improve a little.

review/summary: Great gift
review/text: I brought this as a mother's day gift for my tea loving mother-in-law. It was a big hit. she loved the mug and all the goodie inside. I was kind of disappointed that it did not come packaged as pictured and the bottom of the box is kind of loose. Other than that great buy.

review/summary: Good Gift
review/text: I got this for my mom for mother's day. She loved it. The products inside all looked nice and tasty. I haven't tried them yet, but they looked good. Great variety.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the bottom of the box seemed a little loose. It might have been intentional, but I don't understand why it would have been. Pretty pricey for a broken box. Also the bottom of the mug looked like it had been used. There was a dark stain on it. Upon further inspection it was just dust from the tea leaves that had been put inside the mug, but it was a little embarrassing to give my mom a gift that at first looked like it had been used before.<br /><br />Overall, though it was a good purchase. I would just suggest to the manufacturer to make sure to pay a little more attention to the detail of the presentation of the products inside.

review/text: Quite a sour pomegranate molasses (they vary), but i like that as its much easier to sweeten a dish than to try and get a sickly sweet taste out. Recommended.
