review/summary: Deceptive Packaging - One is not like the others.
review/text: The product description is deceptively incomplete. Other Crystal Light flavors come in packages containing multiple packets such as the other items in my order and indicate a total volume produced when all of the packets are mixed (5 packets per 3.4 ounce package makes 10 quarts of the Ruby Red drink) but they can be mixed to make just 2 quarts at a time. I expected that, similar to the Ruby Red mix, since they were by the same manufacturer, the Strawberry Kiwi mix would come in packets that, when all were mixed would produce 2 gallons (4 packets per 1.9 ounce package makes 8 quarts [2 gallons] of the Strawberry Kiwi drink) and that they, too could be mixed 2 quarts at a time. No where in the text was it indicated that each package had to be fully used and did not contain individual packets. If a photo had been available which there was not, I could have seen that the packages were drastically different and I would have known that they were not like the ones in previous orders.<br /><br />I like the flavor of the product but having to make 2 gallons at a time is cluttering up my refrigerator.

review/summary: Strawberry Kiwi - simply the best Crystal Light flavor
review/text: The flavor isn't strongly reminiscent of either strawberry or kiwi and is no doubt 100% artificial, but I like it, especially with a splash of lime juice.  Can't stand that it's now impossible to find in area stores.  For a while, it was even unavailable here at Amazon.  The price is high, but not outrageous.  Come on, Kraft Foods, put this back on the open market!!<br /><br />Please note that this review is for the "classic" strawberry-kiwi and NOT the new "Pure Fitness" strawberry kiwi, which is easily left on the shelf.  Too bad -- I'm sure that one's better for you.

review/text: One of the only apple drink mixes I found that tastes good. I used to buy the Walmart brand apple drink, but that tasted too fake for my taste. This one contains some sugar so it has some calories, but taste wise it's like light apple juice with a hint of artificial flavoring.

review/text: For vases for my bulbs I used fabric remnants to cover the outside of some old soup cans and make them decorative. Then pour a bit of gravel in the bottom of each can you are using, place a bulb inside, and surround with more rocks about 3/4 of the way up the sides of the bulb until it is securely anchored. Watch over the weeks as they shoot up strong green stalks and then bloom into an intoxicating bouquet.

review/text: I was introduced to this chip brand from a local restaurant.  Very impressed with the flavor and ingredients.  They are not currently available in local grocery stores where I live, and I enjoyed them enough to make me seek them out online!  I look forward to seeing this company succeed.  I hope they continue with the superb flavors and quality ingredients.  I love the fact that -as their packaging states- they are using non GMO , no preservatives, gluten free and "all natural" ingredients.  Proof is in the taste.  Thank you!

review/summary: Seriously hot stuff!
review/text: I have had a bottle of Spontaneous Combustion for 8 years. I love heat. On a scale of 1-10, I rate tabasco at a 1.8 or a 2. Spontaneous Combustion is a 9 or a 10. I use 3 drops to my chili while cooking (about 3 quarts at a time) to make my kids sweat, I add 2 drops more to my own chili to make me sweat. I use this product constantly, but it is so hot, I can only use a few drops to turn up the temperature.<br /><br />My brother-in-law's father is of east Indian descent and lives in Australia. He can go through a bottle in 6 months, but he's the only person I know that can ingest this amount, and stay standing. This is amazingly hot stuff. It is peppery, a little bitter, and hot hot hot! I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Hot, and delicious!
review/text: Spontaneous Combustion is HOT. I say this with sincerity, this coming from a person who can handle hot foods. Now, onto the flavor. If you've ever had any of southwest specialty food's "Hot Sauce From Hell" line, this is very similar in flavor. It's vinegar, peppers, salt, and slight tomato (barely at all). It reminds me of a tamer frank's red-hot (tamer meaning less vinegar, more mellow pepper taste..) but this still has a good vinegar bite.<br /><br />Overall this sauce is excellent, it's a little to hot to use profusely for me currently, but I'll work my way up there..

review/summary: long lasting burn
review/text: Reviews for hot sauces are hard to write. what's intolerable for one person is relatively mild for another. With this sauce, it really depends on what you add it to. Things with a lot of fat in them don't see the same ZOMG HOT HOT HOT as things that are low in fat. Example: 2 drops in a can of tomato soup is more than adequate whereas 10 drops in a can of firehouse chili isn't what i'd call "too hot". What I can say, is that the burn stays with you. My lips are still tingling 15 minutes after finishing eating my chili. This sauce is good for adding heat, but make sure you do so incrementally, tasting along the way. Flavor is lacking in my opinion, so I normally use something milder but with more of a chili pepper flavor when cooking, then use this sauce to boost the "burn" factor.

review/summary: Not as hot or tasty as expected.
review/text: Spontaneous Combustion is OK in flavor.  It's good going down, but has a bitter aftertaste that just won't go away.  It tastes like there's a little too much black pepper.  The heat, while having a nice kick to it, is probably about 6/10 in my book.  This is from a dude who likes spicy grub, but isn't a chili-head by any means.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad, but nothing to go crazy over.  The best thing about S.C. is that it's a good all-purpose sauce.  It's good on eggs, pizza, wings, whatever.  Frankly, though, I've had better.

I prepare hearty chunks of chicken, potato, onion, carrot, green beans, and cauliflower and simmer in chicken broth until tender.  Add frozen peas, followed by the sauce mix. Serve over rice with condiments consisting of plain unsweetened yogurt, lime and lemon pickle, mango pickle, and/or chutney.  ANY meat and broth or water may be used.<br /><br />For a very quick meal--use frozen mixed vegetable medley as your veggies.<br /><br />For the vegetarian/vegan--use vegetables of choice and cook in vegetable broth or water.

review/text: I have bought this product at Safeway for years, it being a favorite of my family. I use it to make chicken curry year round.  However, Safeway suddenly ceased to stock it and I was at a loss until I searched online and found it at Amazon.  I was pleased to find it in a larger portion than I used to buy, and at a much better price.  Safeway inadvertently saved me money when they took it off their shelves!  btw - adding a spoonful of mango chutney to the curry when it's made greatly enhances the flavor!

review/text: Since I never ate curry as a child, I was apprehensive about trying it as an adult.  Not only did I fear smelling like curry for days, I was worried that it would taste bad.  Not so!<br /><br />This stuff is delicious -- and highly addictive.  After a dinner at a friend's house, I went out and bought this brand for my own cooking at home.<br /><br />Extremely easy to use - if you can boil canned chicken broth and water, while adding hard chunks of curry, you can make this.  Just make sure you stir the pot, since it will have the consistancy of gravy.<br /><br />I recommend eating with fried chicken breast meat (bitesized) mixed in with little bits of fried dough (left overs from flouring the chicken) and steamed white rice.<br /><br />YUM!

The taste is bland, although a bit spicy. This would best be used as something you might put on a salad as an accent.<br /><br />This being said, I have also tried The Spice Hunter Jerk Seasoning and it too is awful. Maybe it's because Spice Hunter seasonings are salt free... There's a reason why store shelves are stocked with name-brand products, because they are good. This brand is harder to find and there's a reason. I had such high hopes...

I like their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GZW5OS">Eden Organic Black Beans, 15-Ounce Unit (Pack of 12)</a> too!<br /><br />Adzuki beans are a good source of magnesium, potassium, iron, zinc copper, manganese and B vitamins. As a high-potassium, low-sodium food they can help reduce blood pressure and act as a natural diuretic. When combined with grains, beans supply high quality protein, which provides a healthy alternative to meat or other animal protein.<br /><br />Like most beans, adzuki beans are rich in soluble fiber. This type of fiber provides bulk to the stool and binds to toxins and cholesterol aiding in their elimination from the body.<br /><br />In Japan adzuki beans are known for their healing properties and are used to support kidney and bladder function.<br /><br />Gillian McKeith is a huge fan of the adzuki bean and refers to it as the 'weight loss' bean as it low in calories and fat but high in nutrients.  The high-protein content makes you feel full longer, and the low-fat content helps limit calorie intake.<br /><br />While adzuki beans are a great part of a healthy, weight-loss diet, they also contain protease inhibitors, which are known to disrupt the development of cancerous cells. This is important, because often when people try to lose weight they cut out many foods that deliver necessary vitamins and nutrients, which can be dangerous. That's why adzuki beans, with their nutritious, low-fat qualities, are an important part of a health approach to eating.

review/text: If you're in love with Aduki beans, ordering from Amazon is the easiest way to get them for a great price!  They are worth their weight in gold.  To get past the "dirt" taste, I blend mine with some V8 Fusion juice and vanilla soy milk with a little yogurt for a nice tasting smoothie. Fast shipping too!

review/summary: Delicious and healthy!
review/text: I had never even heard about these until I read about them in the 'Eat Clean Diet'.  I couldn't find them in any stores so I searched online.  They are very good tasting and healthy too!  I don't like them as much as garbanzo beans which are still my favorite, but is nice to have different kinds in my dinner rotation.  I still think Westbrae is my favorite brand, but this one is very good too and supposedly this manufacturer has better packaging practices.  The price isn't that different than other organic beans in stores in my area, so not a bad value.

review/summary: I Love Azuki Beans, But These Are Nasty!
review/text: I love azuki beans. I've had canned and also cooked them from dried beans. In general, I'm fond of Eden products.<br /><br />I don't know what happened with this product. These are beans are gross. First, they are all split apart and crushed. This is not a canned bean issue, as I've had ones in cans that weren't like this.<br /><br />Also, for a reason I'm not sure of, they are more gas-producing than every azuki bean I've ever eaten, and I even rinsed the beans before eating. Oh, can't forget the slime at the bottom of the can (more than average for canned beans).  To top it off, they have almost no flavor.<br /><br />I'm so disappointed. I'm never buying these again.

review/summary: A Good Alternative For People Prone To Kidney Stones
review/text: Since I'm prone to kidney stones, I've had to cut back on milk.  I thought I'd give chocolate soymilk a try since it isn't as thick as regular chocolate milk. Even though I wasn't used to drinking soymilk, and got teased about drinking soy, it wasn't hard to get used to it. Silk has been the best tasting chocolate soymilk that I have ran across.  It is even good for baking, such as in German chocolate cake. :)

Blend one 8.25 oz serving with one frozen banana. Great way to use up overripe bananas (peel before freezing and toss in a ziploc bag) - they're not just for banana bread anymore!

review/summary: Chocolatey and Delicious!
review/text: Silk chocolate soymilk seems to have a stronger chocolate flavor than other soymilk I've tried. The main competing brand of soymilk for me has lately been a brand called ZenSoy, which, despite being lesser known and having a less appealing package, is actually quite delicious as well.<br /><br />Those who prefer a stronger chocolate flavor would probably prefer Silk. Those who prefer a more "creamy" chocolate flavor may find ZenSoy chocolate soymilk more to their liking. Personally, I think they are both great and I'd be happy drinking either.<br /><br />While Silk seems more chocolatey, I'd also say it doesn't seem to taste more sweet. Think dark chocolate vs milk chocolate, perhaps... but the difference is not nearly as noticeable as that. That would be a huge exaggeration. Really though, if you like chocolate milk, either of them would be good choices and I'd encourage trying both of them to see which one you prefer.<br /><br />Soy protein is great too since it's high quality complete protein, similar to what you'd get in meat. It's even better than meat though since it is not accompanied by all the health risks associated with meat or other animal products. It also beats dairy products handily both in terms of not causing diseases like dairy does, and also because unlike dairy protein, soy protein is complete protein.

review/summary: The only soymilk I drink . . .(heck, I don't even drink regular milk)
review/text: First of I'll say that I'm neither a vegan nor a vegetarian (but if I were a vegan I'd definitely stick with Silk . .at least the chocolate Silk), but hopefully my opinion be of some help. This stuff tastes awesome. And that means a lot coming from a person who hates the taste of regular milk. It's rich and chocolate-y without being too overpowering and it really does go down smoothly like silk.<br /><br />Also, I used to babysit a kid that was allergic to everything from the moon to the stars (in essence she was allergic to things such as gluten, dairy products,nuts, and such) and this was perfect for her. It has gluten, nut, or dairy ingredients in it so that was beyond a life-saver. That would really stink to be a kid and not ever have chocolate milk.<br /><br />Also, according to the Silk website, Silk milk is Kosher O-UD . .meaning it's kosher, but it's made with the same equipment as dairy products (it goes through intense allergen clean-up and stuff so it's still kosher/safe for people with allergies). Anyways, since its O-UD, it means that (even after the cleaning) you can't drink it with meat products . . .you can drink it immediately after though...<br /><br />As for nutrition, it's a good scource of potassium, calcium, Vitamin B12, riboflavin, Vitamin A, and magnesium (it also has other stuff but I only listed nutrients that had 10% or more PDV [percent of daily value]<br /><br />Happy drinking!

review/summary: A good replacement for milk!
review/text: Having recently discovered that I had a milk allergy, I quickly looked to find other sources for calcium that didn't involve me having to swallow a horse-sized pill. A friend of mine suggested Silk & I took them up on that recommendation. Being a coward, I decided to go with the chocolate version first as it's hard for anyone to mess up the chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I absolutely love this drink! It's not the same as drinking milk, but after a few days of having this for breakfast I didn't much miss the old stuff. It's got a nice smooth taste & goes along well with the typical breakfast items or as a nice drink later in the day. The carton travels well & I had no problem hauling it along with me when I was out & about.<br /><br />There is a bit of an aftertaste sometimes, but it's not really that bad. I'm tasting it less & less as I continue to drink the product, so I'm guessing that it's less of an aftertaste as much as it is just me getting used to an unfamiliar product. This product is great for those who have dairy allergies, are lactose intolerant or are vegan or vegetarian.

review/summary: I love chocolate milk!!!
review/text: I loveo this milko =o) I buy it at my college cafe when I have a long day of classes, and this is really tasty and gives me energy to get through my long, boring day! Its not thick at all like regular milk and not too choclatey like Nesquik, and its healthy for everyone. I got my mom slowly hooked on Silk milk, the regular flavored one so she buys that now along with cow milk but hopefully I will bring her fully over to the "dark side" :)

review/summary: Great for when you just need a little chocolate.
review/text: I often crave chocolate at some point in any given day.  These little cartons are perfect for satisfying my craving.  If I had the large carton in the refrigerator, knowing me, I would drink one glass, then a litlle more, then a little more....you get the idea.  Even my husband has one occassionally especially if there is nothing else sweet or chocolate in the house.  My little great niece who comes to visit (she is 3) knows right where to look for the little boxes of soymilk. Dingy as I am I didn't even realize it was soy milk I was ordering, but, was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be soy, as I am lactose intolerant, which keeps me from drinking regular milk, but might not keep me from drinking chocolate milk.  The main thing is I wish they would lower their price.  I've gotten some deals on these, but the regular price here on Amazon is way too expensive, although the free delivery right to my door makes me see it as a semi-good value.

review/summary: Silk lies about guarantee of freshness
review/text: I'll open the review with White Wave's (maker of Silk soy milk) response to me regarding the "freshness" of their product:<br /><br />Thank you for your recent e-mail to Silk�. We appreciate your interest in our products.<br /><br />We guarantee the freshness and quality of our products if opened by the freshness date code and used within seven to ten days. However, our products are perishable food items and spoilage may occur if the products are stored in the refrigerator beyond the recommended number of days after the seal has been broken or if there was an interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature. We apologize for the inconvenience, and hope you will continue to enjoy our products.<br /><br />For us, the good news is that you cared enough to let us know about it.<br /><br />Thanks again for contacting the Consumer Affairs Department.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Yvonne Ortega<br />Consumer Response Representative<br /><br />Here is my response back:<br /><br />Thank you for your entirely cut-and-pasted, canned response. I appreciate that you didn't even bother to address me by name. Your lack of care and unfettered indifference overwhelms me.<br />You obviously don't "guarantee the freshness and quality" of your products. Otherwise, you would be offering a refund on my purchase, or some form of compensation for the stale milk you produced.<br />Your product's texture was a little off from day one and your product went completely bad on my family before "seven to ten days after the freshness date."<br />There was no "interruption in maintaining the proper storage temperature" during our trip to WalMart, as we use reusable insulated shopping bags for our refrigerated and frozen goods.<br />So, instead of trying to pass off the blame for your faulty product and shirking your promises, you should consider honoring your "guarantee."<br />I had almost forgotten about writing to you, but due to the nature of your response I have to let other consumers know just how worthless a "guarantee" from WhiteWave is.<br />I'm glad your title is "Consumer Response Representative" instead of Consumer Care Representative; at least WhiteWave is honest about that.

review/text: This was a birthday gift for my husband who has eaten this marmalade for 25 yrs and loves it. Every jar we have opened from this seller (3 out of the 6) has been awful! You have to cut this stuff with a knife! They tried to blame it on being left outdoors and thus freezing until I told them the box was placed directly in my hands by the delivery guy. They are unwilling to do anything about it. Told us that's the consistency of this marmalade and that's it. Very, very disappointed.  Will not buy from them again.

Unless you can't handle ANY heat, don't bother.<br /><br />I did make one decent dish with this sauce.  I covered ribs with the sauce and baked them for an hour, and they tasted great, but more like a sweet BBQ not a spicy jerk flavor.  This just isn't right.

review/summary: Surprisingly Good Dessert Cake
review/text: I saw the Balconi Tiramisu one day and bought it on a whim. I wasn't expecting too much, I just wanted something easy for dessert. I opened the package and sliced the cake and wow! A really tasty cake. The best part is it can keep, unrefrigerated, for up to three months (according to Balconi - don't ask me, they don't last nearly that long in my home.)<br />A slightly sweet, delightful dessert cake. It contains marsala wine; I suppose that will help the shelf life, in addition to giving it moisture and flavor. Also, this contains real Marscapone cheese.<br />If you are looking for a quick, easy and delicious dessert cake, Balconi Tiramisu fills the bill nicely. It is also a very reasonable price. You don't even need to find an italian bakery to enjoy some scrumptious Tiramisu.

review/summary: Dry, very sweet, damaged, will expire in 2 weeks
review/text: I read all five reviews before placed an order.  The cake is terrible and I would not recommend to anyone.  Here is why:<br />(a) Two of the five reviews online said the cake could last 3 months, so I bought 4 cakes in one order.  Guess what, all four I got had an expiration date 2 weeks later.  Maybe I am just that lucky one who got the cakes just before they expired.<br />(b) Tiramisu I've had in restaurants has been moist and NOT very sweet.  This cake is dry and very sweet (comparable to cakes in Walmart).  The dryness may be due to the fact it is close to its expiration date.<br />(c) The cakes arrived upside down.  I opened one and part of it stuck to the cover.  This may have nothing to do with the seller, instead, buying cake online and getting it shipped to you may not be a good idea after all.

review/summary: Tasty, but a bit on the small side
review/text: These bars taste very good and are made from quality ingredients that are all natural. If you don't like snack bars because they're too hard or chewy, give this a try. It's moist and taste more like an oatmeal raisin cookie than a traditional granola bar. It's also shaped like a cookie (or hamburger patty), being roundish rather than rectangular. It's got a good mouth-feel and chewy consistency, but is not overly chewy. I can clearly taste the walnuts, oats, pumpkin spice, and raisins in here, though some of the other ingredients listed are undetectable, like organic agave and coconut sugar.<br /><br />My only complaint is that each serving is quite small and calorically-dense. The box contains 5 individually wrapped snacks. Each 1.41oz bar fits on a credit card and is really comparable to a same-sized cookie at 190 calories each, 80 of which is from fat. Each "cookie" contains 2g of dietary fiber (10% of your daily intake) and 350mg of heart-protecting omega-3 fatty acid. Health officials (from WHO and US Dept of Health) recommend anywhere from 1-3g of omega-3 per day for adults for cardiovascular benefits.<br /><br />From the box: 1.5g saturated fat (8%), 140mg sodium (6%), 15mg cholesterol (6%) Vitamin A (0%), Vitamin C (0%), calcium (2%), iron (4%).<br /><br />Additionally, the box is made of 100% recycled paperboard and printed with soy ink.

They also state that the ingredients I just mentioned are processed on equipment that also makes products containing peanuts, other tree nuts, soy & milk.  This doesn't affect me but I'm sure could be useful to those allergic to nuts.

review/text: Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice Bars are the best gluten free cookie bars that we've found. My husband is on a gluten free diet. It's very difficult to find good tasting commercially made cookies and cakes. So often the products have a very dry texture and bland taste. I ate one of the Pamela's bars too, and had to stop from having another. So far, I've not found the Pamela's brand of products near our home, but will be making some calls to find a retailer in my vicinity.

review/text: You can read about all the positives of this product yourself - the 350mg Omerga 3 fatty acids, the whole grains, the zero trans fats, and the wheat free, gluten free, and dairy free characteristics. All that is fine, but what about the taste? No matter how wonderful the content, taste is the ultimate arbiter, especially when giving these to your kids.<br /><br />As one who's been eating, tasting, and testing foods for well over fifty years, I've determined that Pamela's Oat Raisin Walnut Spice bars have what it takes to pass the taste test. The touch of spice is tasty without being overwhelming, and the texture is varied and interesting. These bars do satisfy though for me the 3 inch length isn't quite enough so I eat them in pairs.<br /><br />Also observed:<br /><br />You'll get your hands a little sticky so don't type and eat.<br />The wrapper is much larger than the bar warrants. Maybe the size is necessary to fit all the product information on.<br />The shape is uneven making it look more like a home made item.<br /><br />Final verdict - Pamela's is a winner.

I don't know exactly what a "whenever bar" is - does that imply that other types of bars can only be eaten at certain times? - but the end result is a slightly unusual product that tastes good.<br /><br />The shape is unusual - they are short and wide - but the taste is good (a nice combination of salty and sweet) and the texture is very chewy, which I prefer to crunchy.  If you have to have crunch in your snack bars, I don't think you will like these much.  They are more filling than I expected, too.<br /><br />I've not seen these in stores, but if you find them and you're in the market for some new chewy snack bars, I'd say give them a try.

review/summary: A Satisfying Gluten Free Snack
review/text: The top part of the wrapper advertises, "Wheat-Free, Gluten-Free, Non-Dairy" and that it's good whenever. In the spirit of whenever I decided to try a bar as my breakfast; the question I had was would one bar provide sufficient nutrition to carry me to lunch without getting hungry mid-morning. I can report that it did just that; I didn't even think about food until after 12 PM. So I would count that as a success.<br /><br />In all fairness I must admit that my lifestyle that morning was much less than vigorous and active and one who is engaging in an active lifestyle with much physical exertion will probably need to supplement one bar.<br /><br />The bar is rather soft and chewy and has a fruity flavor that reminded me of dates; I checked and there are no dates listed so I'm not sure what I tasted. The list of ingredients starts with Gluten-Free Oats with Organic Agave as the second ingredient; the agave is also known as the Century Plant. The third ingredient is a rice blend which includes some rice flours, tapioca starch, and xanthan gum. Walnuts were pretty far down the list and I don't recall encountering any chunks of walnuts. There was, however, a warning for people with allergies that the product was processed on equipment that makes other products that use peanuts and other tree nuts, soy and milk.<br /><br />From a nutritional perspective each bar has 180 calories, 9 grams of fat, 15 mg of cholesterol, 140 mg of sodium, 2 grams of dietary fiber, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />I enjoyed my bar with a cup of coffee and found it sustained me all morning. It is not a cookie or a particularly sweet treat but it is a tasty and convenient food. The package is easy to open if you pinch the wrapper on the front and back and pull it apart.

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: Pamela's Gluten Free Whenever Bars are not bad for a quick bite on the go, but may leave you feeling a little unsatisfied and hollow.<br /><br />Oat Raisin Walnut Spice is an ok flavor combo- soft, chewy and pretty tasty, reminds you of oatmeal cookies- but there's more oats than anything else. Wheat free, gluten-free and non-dairy, they're good for a whenever snack- just as advertised. The box indicates there may be traces of soy due to the manufacturing process.<br /><br />The energy boost is a little light, with 24 g carbs per 40 g bar. That's not much better than a piece of fruit.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed in these in that they're a bit on the small side and the product description is misleading: the box only contains five bars, not six. They're ok, but as I said in my other reviewer I'd still take a Clif bar over these.

review/summary: Excellent taste... and good for you!
review/text: There's nothing to dislike in these Pamela's Products Whenever Bars. They have a wonderful spice-cake flavor & consistency that's augmented by a delightful mix of oats, raisins and walnuts. Everything is natural-no junk or fillers. These lightly sweetened bars are great with coffee, tea or even the ever popular tall glass of cold milk. A great, healthy between meal snack that can be enjoyed anytime of day. They're individually wrapped, so they can be taken along just about anywhere. Great for the kids lunch box/bag so that you'll be confident at least one snack each day is a healthy one!
