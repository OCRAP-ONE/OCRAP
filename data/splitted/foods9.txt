review/summary: A Healing Tea
review/text: A friend sent me two boxes of this for Christmas.  I thought it an odd gift, as I can just go out and buy herbal tea.  Shortly thereafter, I was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis. I started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked!  Not only that, during this time, other family members got physically ill, but I was able to carry on without catching the bug.  Since then, I'm a believer.  I make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed.

review/summary: Medicinal tea that really helps
review/text: In cold weather, I brew this tea by the pot, keep it simmering, and brew a lemon ginger or ginger lemon tea, by the cup, made with this as the base.  My husband will drink it, and I can't get him to use any other medicinal.  (Hates licorise.)  It helped a great deal last winter.

review/summary: Healthy, non-fattening, just the right size and delicious!
review/text: I've been feeding liver biscotti for years. I was looking for a healthy treat without additives for my epileptic dog (additives can be a seizure trigger) and liver biscotti filled the bill. The ingredients are top-quality. The bite-size bits are perfect for training and don't muck up your pockets. The bite-size portions also make it possible to give rewards without adding pounds, which is a problem with other treats.  And for dogs with wheat and other sensitivities, there is an anti-allergenic recipe. Enthusiastically recommended!

review/summary: My Dogs Love This Treat
review/text: My 2 dogs love this treat.  When my oldest (male) was younger, he would sit down, stand up, go down, roll over, etc. and do every trick in his repertoire before I even gave him a command whenever I pulled out a bag of the liver biscotti.  My female also loves this but she's a little less silly.  Also, this has never upset their stomachs nor caused allergic reactions.  I finally had to find a place that sold this in bulk (i.e., 5 lbs. bags) since I was going to the store ALL the time to buy more of these.  I also stuff their Kongs with a combo of these and their regular kibble and some pumpkin and freeze it. I highly recommend this treat.

It cheers 'em up, encourages them to obey, lets 'em know I love 'em, and got me over some really rough training spots with my 90 pound puppy!!!  And in a few instances when I've been slow producing the goodie, they've cornered me and dug in my pocket themselves!  I think it's a hit!

review/summary: bulldogs rule
review/text: Despite what many say and think about bulldogs, ours are picky about their snacks.  They love the liver biscotti which can be a hand-fed treat or used in a treat ball.  They last longer than most snacks and because our bullies don't often chew their food, these are the perfect size.  I don't feel bad about feeding these either because they are low calorie and without fillers.

review/text: The ultimate treat for dogs of all sizes.  Our dogs are absolutely crazy for Liver Biscotti.  We love the size of this treat, it makes it very easy to use them as daily treats and not worry that you are over feeding.  The size is also great for using as bait for conformation showing.<br /><br />We love the fact that all natural ingredients with no preservatives are used.  All you have to do is open the bag and smell what's inside.  It smells so good, you might be tempted to try one too.<br /><br />We love the 5 pound bag.  Having multiple dogs, this bag really is a cost saver.  You'll see significant savings over buying the small 8oz bags.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for your dog loving/owning friends, spread the joy of Liver Biscotti!

review/text: After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner.

review/text: I remember well the "Beer Nuts" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of "Beer Nuts" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask "Beer Nuts" ... 'What happened?'

review/text: *****<br /><br />Oh, I love this pasta! It is thick, chewy, absolutely extraordinary! And made with authentic flavorings to boot! The red are flavored with tomato and red beet powder. The green are flavored with spinach powder and basil powder. The black pastas are flavored with squid ink, the off-white are au naturale. The yellow pasta are flavored with turmeric, the orange with carrot powder. A rainbow of beauty and natural delectable flavor.<br /><br />The pasta are shaped like little cresent moons with a rough exterior to absorb whatever sauce or oil you might use. Because this pasta is so very flavorful, I enjoy it best with a good quality olive oil and some Celtic sea salt. Sometimes I add some tarragon or fresh rosemary, usually not, so I can just savor the pasta alone. It also is excellent with olive oil and fresh grated Parmesan chees on top.<br /><br />With only 1g of fat, 10g of sodium, this can also be a heart-healthy meal. There are 7g of protein and 42g of carbos, no added sugars or preservatives.<br /><br />It is the perfect easy dish to impress company or a date!<br /><br />To be able to buy the best packaged pasta in the whole wide world at HALF PRICE in bulk from Amazon is a wonderful privilege. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />*****

review/text: It's not a traditional BBQ sauce in terms of flavor, but you could easily use it for that. It's very thick and has a strong hotness (not too hot - but hotter than most spicy BBQ sauce) and it's made from much better ingredients than most BBQ or sweet hot sauces. It tastes very fruity rather than sugary sweet. It would be great on almost anything grilled or stir fried, and it's incredible in pork and beans. Don't let the price scare you away from this outstanding condiment.

review/summary: Warning: Reviews do not reflect actual product (Feb 19, 2012)
review/text: The current product, "Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador, sold by SAAQIN", is of terrible quality. Somehow, reviews for a similar item, produced by "Alive and Aware", were associated with this product. The cocoa I received when ordering through this page is made by "Organic Herbal Essence". Alive and Aware is delicious; Organic Herbal Essence is not. Another warning: After receiving the 5lb bag of Organic Herbal Essence and hating it, I ordered "Alive and Aware Certified Organic Raw Cacao Powder from Ecuador - 2 Pounds", shipped by Halaleveryday. I thought for sure I'd get Alive and Aware, given it's in the product title, but Halaleveryday actually shipped me "Organic Herbal Essence". Grr.

review/summary: The Price is Right
review/text: I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks.  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market, this is an excellent price, especially for an organic product.  The cocoa is less "tasty" than my regular brand, but does very well for the price.  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label.  I would like to see an organic label, as well as, the nutrition info for the product.

review/summary: NOT what I originally ordered! BOO, amazon!
review/text: As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for "alive and aware raw cacao" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say "out of stock" or "currently unavailable" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the "brands" and "vendors" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said "alive and aware" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food "of the Gods" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!

This cocoa powder, plus some almond milk, frozen fruit, yogurt, and a dash of maple syrup, makes an excellent "milk shake".

review/summary: Alive and Aware Organic Raw Cacao Powder
review/text: This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.

review/summary: Equidorian OJio Arriba Carillo "RAW Oranic" Cacao
review/text: Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder. Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted. Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor. Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor. Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isn't. It is a antioxidant super-food which has no equal. The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next. As to taste, it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany. In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao. In baking, I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract. If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract, your icing will have no equal. In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake. The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors. I like making cake with 60% cake flour which is about has about 5% wheat gluten and 40% rice flour. The reason for this should be obvious. The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough.<br /><br />Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols, such as catechins and procyanidins, and has been shown to inhibit low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models. Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens.

review/summary: Poor quality product
review/text: This product, described as organic raw cacao powder from Peru, is clearly inferior to all other raw cacao powder I have had.  The taste of this product is definitely not as good -- this product has a bitter, muddy, thin taste as compared to the fuller, richer taste of the real thing from other vendors.  As soon as I tasted this product, which is destined for the trash bag, I understood why it was cheaper than organic cacao from other vendors -- it is nowhere near as good.  Spend a few dollars more and get the real thing.

review/text: I figured there must be bacon out there like bacon used to be - this is it.  If you are of a 'certain age' (over 40 or 50?) you remember the deep smoky flavor of a good bacon; this cannot be found in "store bacon" anymore.  Modern bacon is thin, lightly/poorly smoked - even the so-called 'gourmet' bacon.  This is the old fashioned flavor and thickness of bacon the way it was in the "good old days."  Arrives nice and cool in an ice pack - cheaper if you buy the 12-pack.

review/text: Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.<br /><br />I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.<br /><br />So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.<br /><br />So I'm stuck with 11 packs.<br /><br />See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them.

review/text: Wow--this was the first licorice I'd had in two years after being diagnosed with Celiac disease.  That was one of the hardest things to give up!  These are nice--not exactly like the real thing, but close enough.  There are many companies that call their product "licorice," but they are merely rip-offs of "Dots" candy: i.e. nothing like real licorice--very gooey and stick to your teeth.  These are quite firm, more like older licorice, but still a great chew.  It satisfied me and my craving for "real" licorice.

review/text: Spectrum Naturals Walnut Oil, refined, is a very mild oil. I can't detect any walnut smell or taste any walnut flavor at all. Maybe that's what you want in some cases, though I was hoping for a more nutty flavor like raw walnuts.<br /><br />It does have the advantage of having higher Omega 3 content than most oils. Also most oils that are high in Omega 3 (like fish oil and flax oil) have a strong taste which you probably don't want on your salad.<br /><br />Unlike some of Spectrum's oils, it is not organic.

review/summary: Great taste, safe & Natural
review/text: I have recently been on a low carb diet, as I find that I can no longer tolerate even natural sugars like agave, honey, and dates. These raise the blood sugar which spikes the insulin, a hormone whose message is "store fat!" Insulin also causes the kidneys to retain water and therefore I would bloat from a high carb diet.<br /><br />My dilemma is that I love sweets--and now it is not a problem, thanks to products like stevia, a natural plant that has safely been used in parts of the world as a sweetener for hundreds of years. It has no calories and no impact on the blood sugar (although for some people there might be a bit, as the brain is tricked into thinking it is getting sugar). Stevia used to be legal in the USA only as a cosmetic product because of politics: companies that made low calorie sweeteners such as aspartame did not want competition. Yet, aspartame gave me headaches and even sometimes symptoms of multiple sclerosis. So I would use stevia at times, but the aftertaste was bad--and to be honest, I wasn't too crazy about the "during taste" either.<br /><br />Then I tried NuNaturals. This product is awesome and like no other stevia I have tried. It is not only delicious but also has no aftertaste (unless you put in way too much--a common mistake by people new to this). It comes in tablets and in powdered form (in a bottle or handy packets with individual servings). It also comes in alcohol-free liquid form and even in vanilla flavor. Unlike aspartame (which becomes even more toxic when heated) stevia can be used in baking. NuNaturals has a stevia baking blend just for that. (Since I am a raw fooder, I can't tell you how it tastes, but I am sure it is good, judging by their other products.)<br /><br />Thanks to these great products, I can do a low carb raw diet but not be deprived of my sweets!

review/summary: Only 6.4% Stevia Extract, but very good flavor
review/text: I have mixed feelings about NuNaturals Nustevia White Stevia with Maltodextrin Powder and will probably not purchase it again.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great tasting stevia extract and very easy to use, but it is just 6.4 percent stevia and 93.6 percent maltodextrin filler.  In other words only 6 pennies of each dollar you spend on this stuff is buying you high quality stevia extract powder.  In my opinion, this is unnecessarily dilute; however, it does make it exceptionally easy to measure.  If the labeling said 6.4% stevia extract, I would have passed on this from the beginning as I can get 70% dry stevia extract of the same quality for much less money per serving of stevia. If this is your first time buying stevia, go for it as it's easy to use and tastes great.  If you're accustomed to buying and using concentrated stevia extracts, you will be probably be disappointed by the low concentration of this product's mixture.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- 5-star taste<br />- Easy to measure<br />- Perfect for first-time stevia users<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Cons<br />- Only 6.4% stevia<br />- Not cost-competitive with 70% or pure dry stevia extracts<br />- 3/4 tsp = ~1 tbsp cane sugar<br /><br />Overall, a good product but not the best value.  I would given it 4 stars if the product labeling didn't try to hide the fact that it's just not very potent.  For about 1/3 to 1/2 the cost of this product, you can buy concentrated stevia powders and cut them yourself with a low-cost filler like maltodextrin and come out ahead (or just use them full strength, which is often easier once you get used to the sweetening power of pure stevia).<br /><br />In case you're wondering where I got the 6.4% (by mass) value from, this is how I calculated it.  On a precise scale, I found the density of this product to be 2.5 grams per teaspoon.  The label says it contains 40mg per 1/4 tsp.  Thus, 1 tsp has 160mg stevia extract in 2500mg mixed powder.  The concentration (mass) comes to 64mg stevia per gram of product or 6.4 percent by weight.  Pretty weak stuff, but still much sweeter than cane sugar.

review/summary: Get Healthy Live Better and Longer
review/text: Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon.

Not only is it all natural but it tastes great and is truly a guilt free sweetner.<br /><br />Of all the brands I have tried NuNaturals is the best; it dissolves easily in ice tea and it does not have any bitter taste.<br /><br />I keep the packets in my car and my backpack for when I eat out, I use the stevia baking blend to replace sugar in all my muffins and cookies, and this is large 12 oz jar the best size for use at home. I keep a 1/4 tsp measuring spoon in the jar to spoon it out.<br /><br />I have given up all artificial sweetners. I no longer drink diet coke (and wont until they make it with stevia instead of splenda).<br /><br />If you have not used stevia before I urge you to try it. If you have used other brands and did not like them try NuStevia and you will be impressed.

The packets are easy to carry with you and you may even notice you have less cravings for sugary foods.<br /><br />By using a low calorie (0 Calories) sweetener with only 1 gram of carbs, you will be ahead of the game.

When I found it at Amazon I put it on auto ship so I don't run out.  The price has gone up a lot since I first found it on Amazon, however, it still costs more in stores if and when I can find it there. I make limeade with this which I keep on hand at all times. In a gallon container of water I add 1 cup of lime juice and 2tbsp. of stevia powder. It is refreshing and almost no calories and no chemical aftertaste.  My dad uses the stevia in his coffee and his oatmeal. I haven't tried cooking with it although I know they make one designed for baking, which I'll possibly try this winter.

review/text: I bought the NuNaturals White Stevia with Maltodextrin several months ago as I'm trying to cut back on sugar and artificial sweeteners. The first morning I tried it in my coffee and hated it. It tastes just as bitter as Equal or Sweet n Low. I decided to give it another  try that same day in my lemonade and it was absolutely delicious. I've also tried it in hot tea and it is bitter but wonderful in iced tea. So, I think hot drinks bring out the bitterness in stevia. All in all I'm glad I bought this and also a box of the packets which are very convenient on the go. I have tried many different brands of stevia but, so far this is the only one I have not thrown out. I also tried Truvia. Not a fan. It makes your coffee or tea taste like licorice!

Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though).

It has virtually no bitter aftertase, it's all natural and I've been using it exclusively for more than a year now. It works in both hot and cold beverages and comes in bulk and in packets for portability.I haven't used it for baking and probably won't because the chemistry of most recipes depends on sugar or something similar to get a good effect. However, for daily use in beverages, this product is very good.

review/summary: The best I've ever had!
review/text: I am so happy I discovered this product. I had tried several other brands in extract and powder form and NuNaturals is by far the best. Virtually NO aftertaste, quick dissolving and convenient. It is also very economical at 1.5 cents a serving. I use a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon and it sweetens my coffee or tea perfectly. Do yourself a flavor and get this stevia powder - you'll be happy you did!
