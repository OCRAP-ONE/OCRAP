review/summary: Great Taste and Supposedly Great Quality and Mineral Content
review/text: I was recommended this salt from a website, which is ran and authorized by a prominent doctor who specializes in nutritional balancing.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer that sea salt is essential for human health and longevity, and enjoy trying different kinds.<br /><br />This salt was a great compliment to my foods, and seemed to help alkalize and balance out my body's system. On a side note, high quality sea salts can cause some healing reactions, so don't go overboard on it.<br /><br />Overall, thoroughly pleased with the product. However, I will be trying other salts just because I simply want to.<br /><br />-Ryan

review/summary: I use roller mill, eat like breakfast cereal ---
review/text: I use a hand-cranked roller mill to make rolled oats, and eat these oats uncooked with skim milk for breakfast.  A breakfast cereal with NO ADDED SUGAR!  Also, because it's "heavy," I tend to eat less than with sugared cereals.<br /><br />Package indicates 110 calories and 2.5 grams fat (3% of an adult's suggested daily intake) per 1/4 cup, but I eat about twice this amount (1/2 cup), so it's not really a completely low calorie meal.  But it does "stick to the stomach," and one feels fuller after eating it, perhaps not eating as much at the next meal.  The cost works out to a little more than $2/pound, which isn't inexpensive, but I'm sure that this four-pack, totaling 7-plus pounds, will keep the average family in oat groats for awhile!  Also, it contains an immense amount of fiber -- 17% of the recommended daily amount per 1/4 cup, or about 34% per 1/2 cup the way I prepare it.  So if you need fiber, this is it!<br /><br />I highly recommend this method of preparation (using a roller mill, no cooking).  The taste is nutty, filling.  It takes less than 30 seconds to put 1/2 cup through a roller mill.  I recommend that you don't add sugar.<br /><br />I ordered another brand of oat groats that had an unpleasant taste; these oats taste simply like oats.<br /><br />I ordered the product via Amazon Prime on a Friday afternoon, and Amazon delivered it the next day, Saturday!!  Amazing, Amazon!!!

review/summary: Fresh, Tasty and Wonderful for Breakfast too.
review/text: I love these things. I know, I know...the word groat doesn't conjure up images of deliciousness. Mostly it makes people think of poor people in the middle ages, but that would be one of the few times they certainly had one over on us.<br /><br />These particular groats arrived quickly, well packaged and very fresh. They will store for a very long time, but I suggest transferring them to some other more secure container for long term storage. They were just the right size and cooked up very consistently and with a nice nutty smooth flavor.<br /><br />Groats are something I tried because of the whole grain thing. I just wanted to add one thing that was more healthy to my diet. The instant oatmeal from a packet that I was eating for breakfast has about as much sugar as oatmeal and since it is pre-cooked and then sits in a packet for who knows how long, it is a far cry from actual healthy oatmeal. Enter my google search and how I found out about groats. I gave it a try and have never looked back.<br /><br />They are the whole oat with just the outer coating removed. It's the ultimate in whole grain. I like mine with a packet of Truvia and a little milk. It is firm, nutty and just the right amount of fun to eat.<br /><br />Cooking them is something not everyone agrees on in terms of method. I suggest bringing 1 cup of groats and 2.25 cups of water to a quick boil in a saucepan. As soon as it reaches rolling boil, remove from heat, stir it up well and then cover and leave on the back of the stove overnight. In the morning, just heat it back up on low heat for about 20 minutes to finish the cooking process. That makes about 4 servings and you can store it in a refrigerator for up to a week. Then just dish up a serving, zap for 30 seconds and enjoy a quick breakfast each morning.<br /><br />Other additions are the traditional brown sugar, cream, butter or anything else. Recently, I expanded my use and made a delicious and savory stuffing for a roasting chicken that was to die for.<br /><br />My recommendation: Give 'em a try!

review/summary: I'm loving it!
review/text: Well if you even remotely enjoy oatmeal you will love this stuff. But be warned once you try it you may never want to go back to rolled processed oats again! I am loving the rich nutty flavor, and enjoying the satisfying felling of fullness after having a bowl of these. A fullness that I can only describe as a felling of "euphoria" if you will. I am guessing the felling comes from eating a whole grain food like this as a way my body is thanking me for the healthy offering. xD But honestly I have no idea why I get that felling after eating this product.<br /><br />But what I do know is this is an excellent food for anyone looking to lose weight. As it takes your body a wile to digest this down, and thus you stay fuller longer.<br />Only cons with this product is that it takes like 2 hours to cook down to where it is soft enough to eat but well worth the time for sure. Other then that I am very pleased with this product, and will probably never again go back to processed rolled oats.<br /><br />Highly recommended product!!

review/text: This is my first Amazon review to write (I read so many and rely on them in deciding what to buy)...I wanted to share that these oat groats are really delicious and fresh!  At night, I grind some slightly in my Vita-Mix dry container (that we recently bought on Amazon) and add boiling water to them - then, in the morning, I heat them for a few minutes and they are ready to eat.  I think eating them this way is much more nutritious than buying pre-processed/packaged oatmeal and oatbran (which I have been doing for years)...plus the taste is much better!

I was drinking Starbucks' Chai Tea Lattes while Mystic Chai was discontinued and they are good, but Mystic Chai is WAY better tasting, cheaper, and fewer calories. It's amazing mixed with water...you don't need milk to make it taste awesome. Love, love, love this stuff!! Not to knock Amazon, but you can get 2-2lb cans of Mystic chai for $14 through Sam's Club!

They responded quickly letting me know I can still purchase it online at Sam's Club or straight from them but I checked with Amazon just in case and found it. It is just as great as I remember it. I have also tried other chai's but they do not EVEN come close to Mystic Chai.  You will not go wrong with Mystic Chai.

review/summary: My Favorite Mass-Market Jerky
review/text: Sugar Ray's Honey Chipotle is my absolute favorite jerky available in average/common stores.  Its not too soft or too hard. Just enough density to give a satisfying chew without overworking my jaw muscles. And the flavor is fantastic! A little sweet with a gentle kick of spice. You say "gentle kick", what is that? Enough spice to warm my mouth, but not tear me up or make my nose run. Also enough spice to keep the vultures (my kids) from wanting more than just a taste.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving this 4 of 5 stars is the price.  This jerky is a little bit more expensive than comparable products...I just can't resist the flavor! Haha.  So if you don't like the price, don't try it.  Like me, you might not be able to go back to your old jerky.

So when I found this brand I was very pleased. It tastes great and did I mention it has zero fat? Oh yeah, I did. But each service (28 oz) only has 50 calories, no carbs and some good protein.

It's real pieces as apposed to the artificial looking variety. The flavor has a nice smoky BBQ base and the sweetness of the honey and the mild heat from the chipolte is perfect.

review/text: I love these little packets. I saw somewhere in the comments that another customer got a batch with an expire date on or near the same month. Whoever sold them that box should have sent them a brand new one. Mine won't expire for 2 or 3 years. It was made just this past month. I got them for emergancy use because they last so long. My only gripe is that a teenager must have designed the packets because they are so bloody hard to open. I had to look for a pair of pliars to get a grip on the pull tabs, and even then it was like pulling teeth to open because the plastic tray was so flexible it bent back along with the top cover. I have seen better designed jelly packets that allow the corner of the plastic under tray to be broken, and then it's much easier to open. I hope this manufacturer takes a hint and redesigns their product. Other than that, the product tastes great.

review/summary: Delicious Salt Without Odd aftertaste.
review/text: I normally use kosher salt for things like pasta water and other larger quantities, but this is a great table salt that has a very pleasant taste. For those who don't pay much attention to the real flavor of the salt they use, it might not be worth the difference, but for those who savor their dining experience and pay attention to flavors of their food, this is very nice- no weird aftertaste, and not too harsh. Looks pretty lightly sprinkled on things that need a little extra hit of saltiness. It supposedly has health attributes  for allergies and asthma, which I can neither attest to, or deny. As all salt, it does have sodium, but I believe I read that it has enough flavor so that you can use less.

review/summary: Emeril's Italian Essence??
review/text: I hope this stuff is really great when added to Italian meals. I ordered two bottles because I expected the best from Emeril, live and learn. I opened one bottle and removed the seal to smell the "essence". Wow, to my surprise not only was the bottle less than half full, but the contents are powder, no body to the ingredients what so ever!! This stuff is not cheap and from now on I will buy items like this in my local stores, that way I can take it back if it is like this stuff. BAM, my butt. This will also make me very wary of any other Emeril stuff.

review/text: If you are having a large group in for an ice cream sundae event, definitely buy this topping. It has such a strong flavor. I couldn't stop eating it and I have a weight problem, so therefore I won't be purchasing it again unless it's for an event at my church. For the ones that can "Yield to Temptation" I say, yes, buy it!

review/text: Didn't taste at all natural like a real key lime pie.  I recommend that you skip this flavor of this product and instead try the lemon and strawberry flavors, which are much better.

review/text: I was really looking forward to trying this flavor from my assortment, but found it to be rather bland.  Did not experience the off-taste reported by other reviewers, but would have liked a stronger lime flavor.  Also, I used both envelopes, as directed for a 9 inch pan, but apparently the sugar-free crusts I ordered from Amazon are smaller (8 inches?) and I ended up using two crusts, which left the pies with adequate but not overly generous filling.  I will try using one package next time instead of both.

review/summary: Not for dogs who chew their food
review/text: My veterinarian recommended these because I was having a hard time getting my 17-year old beagle to take her pain medication. I had tried all the usual ways (sticking the pill into cheese or dog treats, putting it on the back of her tongue and holding her mouth shut, etc.), so I was willing to try anything.<br /><br />There's nothing unusual about these treats that makes a dog eat them any differently than anything else. So, I stick the pill in, my dog starts chewing the pill pocket, and soon she's foaming at the mouth because she bit into the pill.<br /><br />If your dog wolfs down food without chewing, this product will work, but is probably unnecessary. If your dog chews food, it just won't work.

The pills go in the "pocket" of this, and it just squeezes shut.  She does not smell the pill or taste it and she loves the pill pocket and thinks it is a treat. I no longer fight with her about pill time.  If only every problem were this easily solved!

review/text: These work great for hiding pet medications. Just place the pill inside the pocket, squeeze to seal the edges, and then roll into a ball. I have four dogs, three of which will eat a loaded pill pocket with no problem, but for the fourth who tends to chew her treats thus discovering the pill inside, I simply place a loaded pill pocket inside a bowl of her favorite moist dog food and wait to see that she eats everything. This usually does the trick and she comsumes the food along with the loaded pill pocket without noticing anything out of the ordinary.

review/summary: lifesaver!
review/text: My dog has to take 1 1/2 pills twice a day.  Before we tried these, we tried cheese, hot dogs, soft treats, and simply stuffing it in her throat. The soft treats would have been great but she always managed to find the pills(which are tiny)and spit them out after eating the treat, same with bits of hot dog.  Cheese worked but it was annoying and sticky to use.<br /><br />We saw these pockets at our vets office and they are perfect.  I can pre-load 14 pockets with the pills and fill one of those pill holder thingys that have a lid for a.m. and p.m. for 7 days.  When you drop the pills into the pocket, you pinch the top closed, then mold it into a ball.  They fit well into the pill holder and now my husband and I no longer have to ask each other "did you give Betty her pill?" twice a day anymore. I definitely recommend doing this because then you only have to mold them once a week and they smell bad-like super strong dog food. I guess she loves the taste, she begs for her pill every day now.  She knows the sound of the pill holder lid popping open and runs in.<br /><br />warnings:<br /><br />1-when we first started using these-the dog had wicked gas for a few weeks-horrible but it eventually went away<br /><br />2-if you pre-load the pills into the pockets like I do, make sure to keep them up high.  We left them too close to the edge of the counter once and our other dog managed to knock them down, get the lid off the thing and eat all the pill pockets.  So he got about 5 days worth of seizure medicine!  I had to call poison control!  Now we make sure they are up high and pushed back.

Just put the pill in the open split at the top, smoosh the split closed, and give the pill pocket like a treat.  It works everytime!  She loved the taste, and had no idea that there was medication enclosed.  THESE REALLY REALLY WORK!!!  Plus, the price is amazingly low.

The pill was really a bitter pill and one that many dogs object to so I can't blame her.<br /><br />However, with pill pockets there has never been any problem.  In fact when I go to get her medicine she follows me and eagerly waits for her 'treat'.  Pill pockets saved her life.  They are worth the price.<br /><br />Follow the directions on the back of the package.

You name it, he refused it.  Eventually he stopped eating entirely because he could smell the four pills in his food.  I was resorting to grinding pills twice a day and squirting the smelly liquid into his mouth. It was terrible.  Then the groomer recommended Pill Pockets.  I honestly didn't think it would work but it has literally been a lifesaver.  He loves them and eats them like treats with his pills inside.  I get the small, beef flavor .  My dog is almost 14 years old and on heart medication.  I was losing hope a few months ago until I found this product.  Now he gets his medication twice a day everyday and he he looks forward to it.

She is excited to eat them everyday and doesn't have a clue her medicine is in them....or doesn't care because of the yummy taste.  The price was excellent compared to the $9 - $12 for one packet in most pet stores.  More suprisingly was the customer service I received.  After sending an email requesting money back for my expedited shipping costs as I did not think I received my order in time, I quickly got a response.  A representative from the company explained exactly how expedited shipping actually worked (I wish Amazon was this detailed) and that they were in fact within the time limit as promised.  I received several emails back that not only answered all my questions, but also educated me on the whole shipping process.  I appreciated the personalized service I received, and can't wait to buy from them again!

review/text: This is a fantastic product!  My bull terrier was capable of spitting out a pill no matter what it was inserted into...peanut butter, steak, chicken, hot dogs...you name it, I've tried it.  Now he patiently waits while I get his pill ready and gulps it down...absolutely amazing!  I will never be without this product!!!

review/text: Well, we ordered the beef pockets and got chicken instead. Fortunately my dog will eat either kind so I wasn't too upset. Order arrived very quickly. These pill pockets are the best if you have dogs who don't take pills well. My dog thinks she is getting a treat every morning.

review/text: I originally bought these for my Sheltie puppy for the reason given - as pill pockets. He loves them so much - and so does my vet - that I now use them all the time as his treats. I am visiting my sons who also have Shelties - it's very cute to see them lining up, sitting and being very good and quiet just so they can have their Pill Pocket of the day. And of course Amazon has the best prices around, best service and best shipping of anybody else online.

review/summary: Wish I'd found these twelve years ago
review/text: I have two twelve year old beagles that both need pills twice a day. I have been struggling to get them down and it was getting pretty ugly.  My vet recommended these and I used the first bag from his clinic. Then I ordered them here for a LOT less. These are wonderful.  I break them in two and make them last even longer since my dogs pills are so small. They just love the beef flavored ones.  Kudos to whoever invented them.

review/text: We always buy this brand at the pet store, so the 2 stars go to the seller that shipped 9 out of 12 cans severely dented. Keep in mind that you are paying a premium for the variety of flavors, meaning it is about $4 more expensive than getting it at the pet store. I believe they should warn their customers about the really bad shape of the cans.<br />The quality of the food is exceptional!

review/summary: Quality gourmet chocolate with no after-taste
review/text: As is, Cocoa D'Arriba consists of the best and natural ingredients only; no emulsifier, no artificial Vanillin. Concerning the high quality ingredients and business ethics, these are big pluses. However, as most reviewers have complained, there is barely any taste, let alone the fact that it is not rich or fulfilling for that matter. This is most likely due to the fact that Cocoa D'Arriba is ultra-refined (14 microns) to generate a smooth and mellow taste. That is, the chocolate is over-refined, thus very little has remained from the original rich chocolate taste. You can run into the same problem in olive oil industry, where sometimes the oil is ultra-refined during pressing, which brings about the lack of actual olive taste and thus character. Too sad.<br /><br />I recommend Hachez Orange Bar 77% Cocoa instead, which is certainly a more successful product in the series. The natural orange-oil in it brings about a very mellow yet significant and pleasing orange flavor to this dark chocolate bar. It definitely adds  much flavor and gives some character to this over-refined chocolate bar. It has more taste and after taste.

review/summary: Excellent Chocolate
review/text: This is excellent chocolate.  Hachez is a quality brand.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because I reserve that for the 88% Hachez in the red wrapper, and the 85% Valrhona.  For those that had one bad experience with this chocolate (or any other that has otherwise gotten good reviews) give it a second try.  You may have gotten a stale bar or perhaps a less than perfect batch.  Fine chocolate will vary, although my experience is that Hachez is very consistent.<br /><br />If you want more bite go to World Market and get their 99% or 100%.  I wouldn't recommend them as anything more than taste dares, however.  If you're looking for a better deal on chocolate bars like this I do suggest you look at World Market.  That's where I've found most of the dark chocolate I have tried and their prices typically run from $2.50 to $4.00 on most bars.  Unfortunately the Hachez has been out of stock at my local store for several months, as has the Valrhona.<br /><br />I must say the "no flavor" review is fairly absurd.  While I've found many dark chocolate bars that were sub standard, I have never found any dark chocolate that had "no flavor".

review/text: This used to be my favorite dark chocolate until I discovered the 88% dark Hachez bars.  One reviewer thought it was crumbly but my guess is that they had something cold in their mouth before eating it - you don't want to do that with dark chocolate or it doesn't melt on the tongue very well. This company makes some very smooth but intense chocolate for those who don't like the bitterness or sourness of very dark chocolate.  I just came home from Germany and stocked up on Hachez at the duty free shop.  I wish I'd bought more.  This stuff is fantastic!

Lemon wintergreen by Republic of Tea (the only tea of theirs I'll drink), Frontier loose leaf (just peppermint, just spearmint... any mixing I do myself)... and this... this tastes exactly like it sounds... like moroccan mint... some people won't care for it if they've gotten used to the candied flavor of American brands, but this... is a treasure for sure... and I've found a single bag can, if you keep your water nice and hot, provide flavor for anywhere from 12-16 ounces of super hot water... this one you want to steep hot as you can, btw...<br /><br />What can I say... I'm a huge fan and have been since the first month Numi was unleashed to my store shelves long ago... as long as they keep the quality up to this standard, better believe at 25 cents a bag, I'll be buying these 6 packs!

review/summary: Premium Mint Tea, Really From Morocco
review/text: *****<br /><br />Moroccan Mint is a premium Numi tea. This herbal tea is certified organic and is kosher.<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer says it better than I ever could: "In the Moroccan spring, the snow melts off the Atlas Mountains, watering the plains below. As the days warm, some of the most soothing, refreshing and full-flavored mint flourishes in this ancient land of the Berbers. With a flavor as light and lively as a newly picked leaf, our choice organic mint will become your favorite mint teasan. An all-day or after-dinner delight, no wonder the Moroccans drink ten cups a day."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a big savings over single boxes. If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry.  If you are new to Numi but love mint teas, this is one that will not disappoint.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Hot Smoked Salmon
review/text: This is a hot smoked wild caught Alaskan pink salmon, prepared in the traditional Native American Style, not European Style cold smoked Lox.  This product is best served at room temperature, rather than cold, which is what the previous reviewer probably did, thinking they had purchased lox.  The 'goo' that came out of their pouch was probably the result of the refrigeration.  I've been eating this product for several years (they opened back about 25 years ago) and I've never had 'goo' come out of a package.<br /><br />A note about the smell, cold smoked lox doesn't have nearly the strong smoked salmon smell/taste as hot smoked salmon, so it can be a big surprise for those who aren't familiar with the product.<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Sockeye over Pink Salmon, however both products are very tasty.  It's great to serve with cheese and crackers, or to break up and add to an alfredo pasta dish.  Just remember, it isn't lox!

review/text: I expected smoked salmon similar or better than what I can buy locally.  It is NOT.  Opened the package and a thick goo flowed out. It didn't look or smell right.  The salmon seemed COOKED, not smoked.  The two packages were completely different in appearance. I don't know if it was a different type of salmon--there was no indication of what type of salmon it is (it was not Coho or Sockeye.  I suspect it was Atlantic salmon due to the grey color) or what was used in the processing.  Not even dietary information (calories, etc) that is required on food sold in the US.  All you're really buying here is a wooden box keepsake, poorly made in China filled with chum.

I order several different flavors to give them some variety. I will also say that when I adopted my fatty 21 pounder, i tried for years to get him to lose weight. Recently the vet told me he lost 5 pounds! (that's like 50 pounds in humans) and I will honestly say the pounds didn't come off until I started feeding him this stuff. I gave him high quality dry food, pure tuna (pet food) from TJs and nothing worked. until this.<br />And the price is right! I'm hooked.<br /><br />update: i still buy tiki cat for my furkids b/c it's better than supermarket brand. But the fatty 21 pounder lost weight (10 pounds total) because he has an overactive thyroid. I didn't find this out until recently and don't want to mislead anyone. So now he is on special pills, and oh yeah, prescription kidney food for him (he is older and kidney probs are common in older cats). The other two still devour this stuff, and when (formerly fat) kitty can sneak, he grabs from his sisters.

review/text: I bought this product to try and, while I find it is a good quality tea, I will probably not be buying it again.  It's a typical English Breakfast style tea flavor wise, somewhat malty, strong and darkish, and makes for a bracing cup of tea.  What I didn't like about it was how astringent it was, almost to the point of being bitter.  So, if you don't like teas that are strongly astringent (puckery dry mouth feeling like a cabernet or zinfandel wine) this is not the tea for you.  The Irish Breakfast and the Assam are much better in my opinion.  More malty, less astringent.

review/text: i paid $15 for 36 bags of snacks- so i figure .41cents a bag is a good price to have portion control and way less expensive than vending machines. it does cost twice as much money than buying the big boxes- but i don't have to worry about eating too much once i open the larger boxes- and i don't have to worry about them going stale.<br />-the 'use by' date is FEB 2013, so plenty of shelf life-<br />-the cheddar/jack variety is nice and sharp- prefer that flavor. the white cheddar is a nice change of pace- and the regular variety are the same as always.<br />-none of them were crushed and all the bags/boxes arrived in pristine condition
