review/summary: amazon prime
review/text: I saw these items advertised and thought they looked like they might be good and would like to try them. I looked at the Amazon item and found them @ 12 for 24.75 and thought WOW!. If I bought them and did not like, I was out a bunch of cash.<br />I went to the local Mart and found them for a buck fifty, bought one each of three flavors.I found them to be quite good, liked them and they are quick and easy.<br />I will buy them again but not from Amazon.<br />I am a prime member and after a year I found that, for the most part prime is a scam that needs to be looked into by the Gov.<br />The inflated prices on items more than pays for the cost of shipping and handling.The Prime membership fee then is pure profit.<br /><br />I will probably, buy from Amazon, one time items but not items bought on a regulsr basics.<br />Any one who has an over abundance of cash, please post here and I wll contasct you asI could sure ise it. Thank You!<br />Louis Patyk

review/summary: Better than expected, generous amount of peach, and mostly whole oats
review/text: These are fast, convenient, easy, and tasty. Sized about right for a good breakfast, especially if you add an apple or other fruit, or some cheese. What I was not expecting was how good it would taste, the amount of peach, and the whole oats. There is enough peach for some in every bite, although not as much almonds. The downside as others have stated is how much sugar there is. But overall for getting me to eat my oatmeal and for being satisfying and tasty, this is a definite recommend.

review/summary: Good oatmeal
review/text: I tried this kind for the first time through Amazon.  I am very limited when it comes to grocery shopping and use Amazon to get the stuff I can not find.  This product was very good.  I liked the containers and will only buy these containers again.  The berry flavor of the oatmeal was delicious.  Very easy for a person like me to prepare (handicapped).  I would recommend this oatmeal to everyone.

review/text: This Quaker Oatmeal with wild berries is the most delicious oatmeal I have ever eaten. I received some a few months ago as a food gift.<br />I was unable to find it locally. I called the Quaker Oats Company to ask where I could purchase it and was told it was unavailable in my County. I was so disappointed. I went to Amazon.com and typed in the product name. Bam! There it was ! I was so excited I had to order a case of it. Buy it, try it, you WILL love it!

review/text: We adore this oatmeal.  I was surprised at how good the ingredients list was and the taste is wonderful!  Large dried cherries, plenty of pistachios and I believe there are even almonds as well as multi-grains.  We reordered in different flavors hoping to find them as tasty.  We even ate it uncooked with milk...still yummy and quick as we are always running out the door to work, some class...whatever.  Great, quick breakfast item!

review/text: I just tried the peach almond this morning and love it.  I can't wait to try all the other flavors that I also purchased.  The convenience is great and you don't have to find a cup or bowl for microwaving.  Due to the cost, another reviewer mentioned to make your own.  I do not agree with this at all.  By the time you purchase the oatmeal, peaches, nuts, etc. that are in each of these, you would be spending a lot more than what these cost.  I will continue to purchase these for breakfast at work!

They were easy to make and tasted good compared to 'regular' oatmeal I have tried. It was a bit too sweet for me but I still liked it. Going to get a big pack and stack these up.

review/summary: Excellent, delicious, healthy, portable breakfast
review/text: I was skeptical at a "summer berry" oatmeal. It's difficult to reconstitute berries, but Quaker has managed to do it. It's slightly sweeter than I might like, but otherwise delicious.<br /><br />It's important to follow the microwave directions exactly, especially stirring before microwaving. Failure to do so will result in lumpiness and an inconsistent texture. It's ready in just 45 seconds, which is perfect when racing out the door to work.<br /><br />Also note that this is results in a thicker oatmeal than you might be used to. However, it's delicious and just right.<br /><br />It also contains 8 grams of protein, which is more than many breakfast cereals (excluding milk).<br /><br />I also keep a few at the office for those mornings I wasn't able to grab breakfast before I left.<br /><br />I've tried several other flavors <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04BY6">Quaker Real Medleys Peach Almond Oatmeal</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007N04AF6">Quaker Real Medleys Apple Walnut Oatmeal</a>, and this is by far my favorite.<br /><br />The Peaches in the Peach Almond are great, but the almonds don't work as well for the texture and flavor; I will not reorder this flavor. The Apple Walnut is what you'd expect for an Apple Walnut oatmeal. It's good, but not great. I will reorder it for variety.<br /><br />I'll definitely order the berry flavor again.

review/summary: Too grainy for my taste
review/text: Usually a big fan of Bob's Red Mill products, this one does not blow my mind. The first few times I cooked it in the microwave, it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess (Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read). Covering it with a plate or foil does not help. I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over. You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it's cool enough to eat.<br /><br />The texture of this cereal is very grainy, which can not be helped by adding more liquid. I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture, sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it.<br /><br />I prefer Bob's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this.

Note I'm a huge cream of wheat fan and I loved the taste and texture of this product. I cooked w/ plain water and this morning at work i put 2 tablespoons of almond milk to help bind while re-heating.. no sugar no extras and it was again enjoyable.

review/text: I've been adding Tulsi Tea to my diet.  I love the peppermint flavor and drink it daily along with my other great teas.<br /><br />I didn't really care for the flavor of this honey chamomile tea.  I don't think it was the honey flavor that was bothersome- actually the Tulsi just seemed at odds with the chamomile.  It actually tastes a bit like basil, which I hadn't experienced with the peppermint, I guess because the tastes meshed so well together.  In this cup, I actually felt like I was drinking Basil-Chamomile tea.<br /><br />I can say I've never tasted the anise flavor that people find prevalent in Tulsi teas.

review/text: I absolutely love Sense of Peace tea, but it it not the most affordable in it's bag form, so I joyfully bought an entire pound.  It does taste good, but for some reason it just doesn't have quite the complex, pleasing flavours of the bags.  Perhaps it it just too 'big', and the small tins preserve the spectrum of taste within the tea.  The mint is dulled and so is the rose ... not quite as good as the bags.  It is still a lovely tea, and I still enjoy it, but unfortunately, cannot use it as a substitute for the cost of the bags.

review/summary: Wonderful Tea
review/text: I love rose petals in tea, especially when they add flavor rather than just being there for visual appeal. The smell of roses is very calming, and I use rose absolute to ground me in times of stress and anxiety.<br /><br />This tea is redolent of roses and sweet mint, the white tea provides a delicious base for the mint and roses to blend creating a blend that truly is calming, peaceful, and balancing.<br /><br />It tastes amazing too. The White Tea, roses and mint are blended perfectly so that none overpower the others. The rose isn't too strong and perfumey, but isn't overwhelmed by the mint, and the delicate white tea sparkles through it all. It is terrific hot, and amazing iced. I sweeten it with 1/3 teaspoon of KAL Pure Stevia Extract for 2 quarts of iced tea or 1/8 tsp for a 4 cup pot of hot tea and it is just perfect.<br /><br />If you like mint teas, especially those with a rose component I highly recommend this tea.

review/text: upon reading the reviews and the fact that my dog loves the regular dingo bones and the dingo twists, if figured id try these too. theyre great. my dog loves the red strip of "chicken". lol idk about chicken being red but what ever, he loves it. keeps him busy and out of trouble. before he destroys the little ball i try and play with him rolling it around but he just gets it in his mouth and paws and goes to town. highly recommend this product. PS, Idk why, but theres a dingo dental mini bones...its the same as the other regular mini bones. those are also cool. I find those last the longest, so get those if you want these bad boys to last.

review/summary: Great Treats for Teacups
review/text: Having a finicky four legged eater can be challenging when they are smaller than your average small breed. I have a teacup yorkie, who like most fur babies is spoiled rotten, but most products out on the market and readily available are too big for tiny bite, and those we do find tend to be discontinued by local stores. We use to give my dog the mini dingo bones, which she loved but really had to work for. The goof balls are better for her size and age, really easy to get to the chicken meat. these are great for older dogs or puppies.

review/summary: Best Cocoa Powder Available
review/text: A while back I went on a quest to find the best cocoa powder, and the Cacao Barry Extra Brut won hands-down.  It has a very deep, rich chocolate flavor, without any off-notes or bitterness.  Despite what you may read elsewhere, this dutch-process cocoa actually has a stronger chocolate flavor than the natural cocoa powders I have tried, so it is a good substitute for them.  I recommend it for any baking or cooking recipes.

review/text: I'm still trying to find a Dutch processed cocoa as rich and flavorful as the no longer available Hershey's European Cocoa (Silver Label) which was cheap in comparison to some of the other Dutch processed cocoas I've tried since.<br /><br />This is MUCH better than Droste (which, in my opinion, is tasteless)-<br />It is  better than Penzys, slightly better than Double-Dutch Dark from King Arthur, but not as good as Bensdorp.

review/summary: I love this Cacao
review/text: I bought this cocoa from a local store in November and shared it with my Mom. We absolutely love it. I make use it for everything. The color is amazing!  It's really is amber colored just like it states on the package. I use this cocoa in a red velvet cake and my cake had a richer flavor. My favorite cake to make is old fashioned chocolate cake (cooks magazine recipe) it calls for cocoa and the Barry's really kicks it up a notch.  My Mom made hot chocolate and swore she was not going back to the common grocery store brands.  I forgot to mention that I'm a trained Pastry Chef and I like to use quality products in my kitchen. We used Barry in school so I know it's quality.

review/summary: Rich cacao flavor to drink and cook
review/text: A high quality, high taste product<br /><br />This powered cacao is different from the "standard" dutch processed 100% chocolate powder in the fact that it does have 25% some cacao butter. The result is that you can use it in any chocolate creation - from drinks to ganache truffles - without needing to add a fat component.<br />As the cover of round truffles it is absolutely fabulous. No sugar taste (there is no sugar in it) but a strong cacao taste, full of forest flavor and slightly spicy.<br />I highly recommend this caco and wish I could eat more.....

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: I was reading how healthy chocolate is. They all said dark chocolate was the best. So since the active ingredient in chocolate is cocoa, I looked up good cocoa powder.<br /><br />This stuff is cost-efficient and healthy. I have two heaping tablespoons full every morning (mixed in with a glass of water). It reduces my morning caffeine intake because my brain turns on after my cocoa.<br /><br />They last for a long time. I bought two, and I've been working on my first one this whole time. If you're drinking pure, unsweetened cocoa mixed in with water, you may have to hold your nose the first couple of times. But then you get used to it, and you taste the chocolate.<br /><br />Recently my parents went to See's Candies and bought me a bar of chocolate. I was thankful, but I could have gone without it. I already am choco-satisfied with my cocoa powder.<br /><br />I'll be buying more of this when I run out. It's great for your health. Your brain, your heart, and more.

review/text: I'm not impressed by this cocoa powder, wish I could return it because I don't intend to use it. It's got an off vegetable scent, like the cheaper cocoas, not rich and warming and chocolatey. Out of the package, it has a back note scent of dishwater, it's the only reference I can make, sorry!  I've tried ghiradelli, and this is similar to the cheap taste of it. I'm sticking with vahlrona. I baked a cake with this powder, and it had very little flavor, just bitter with a slight scent of chocolate. I gave it two stars, because it is better than Hershey's, ghiradelli, and the other supermarket brands, but, still, why waste time baking and cooking with it if it's going to taste only slightly different.

review/text: i like the idea behind this product. Slow burning carbs, sustained energy. And it does provide just that. However, the taste is a little iffy. Its not horrible, but i have tasted other bars that are much better. The savior in these bars is the chunks of berries that are contained throughout, as they provide a balance to the not so good tasting stuff inbetween. Either way, these are healthy, good for you, and if the company can work on the taste, i would give them 5 starts.

review/summary: A delightful Earl Grey
review/text: This one tastes exactly as an Earl Grey should. Medium body, flavorful: the black tea is perfectly balanced with hints of the bergamot & jasmine. The bergamot is non-intrusive (I say this because sometimes tea makers go overboard with it) yet still there, subtle in the background; the jasmine makes the aroma very appealing. It has an almost sweet aftertaste.<br /><br />Make sure to use boiling water since it's a black tea and don't oversteep, or it'll get bitter. (Take the teabag out of your cup after about 2-4 min. depending on how you like it, but no longer.) Suggested brew time is 4 min. I like 2-3 min since it's a fast-steeping tea. You can prime the leaves for steeping by pouring hot water over the bag in the cup first and then immediately throwing that water out. This will allow  some water to soak into the leaves and help them start to release their oils & aroma (also known as "Chinese rinsing," this gets out some of the caffeine). Or, if you you like a darker brew you could just shake the bag up and down in your cup in the first few seconds so all the surface of the leaves have contact with water. Whichever.

review/text: Having been a Lipton drinker for years, I thought Tazo set the standard for sophisticated teas; then along comes the Mighty Leaf. And it is mighty indeed! Unlike Lipton or Tazo, I find that my second or third cup of tea using the same Mighty Leaf bag tastes almost as strong or as flavorful as the first! I've never had that experience before. Even Tazo teabags lose their flavor if you use it a second time. The taste is rich and smooth and you don't even need to add lemon. I first had this at a four star restaurant after a big meal and it was the perfect accompaniment to my creme brulee. I knew I had to buy it after that. It may be a little pricey but you do get what you pay for.

review/text: I love the concept of these tea bags (loose leaf tea, pretty mesh bags), but they don't deliver delicious tea flavor or any decisive bergamot. Every time I have them I am disappointed (& I have them a lot because they're carried where I work). I keep trying again, but there is barely any difference between the Mighty Leaf Earl Grey and their English Breakfast! The English Breakfast is more bitter, that's the only difference. This tea is mild... in every way. It tastes like neither tea nor Earl Grey to me.<br /><br />Better Earl Grey versions abound! Even Stash is more fulfilling. For a stark comparison though, I would recommend the Earl Greys by Revolution or Far Leaves. Those are how it should be.

review/text: Kind of disappointed with this blend. The tea itself is a bit bland (in intensity) which is not a bad thing. However the flavor is pretty bland and weak as well... I've found that Tazo's full leaf tea bags used by Starbucks (Earl Grey) are the best in flavor intensity - partly because they are designed to over-ride the milk in the tea lattes.<br /><br />Don't think I'd be ordering this one again but will finish all of the boxes...

review/summary: Dishonest Packaging
review/text: This is a great Earl Grey, but I will not be buying it again until they change their packaging.  I was very disappointed when I opened the box.  They brag about their "green practices" and their "biodegradable pouches," but then individually wrap each tea bag in *plastic*!  I appreciate their concern for freshness, but a foil or waxed paper liner for the box would do the job well without compromising their stated values.

review/summary: Great to have on hand
review/text: These are terrific little pouches of culinary potential.  Good shelf life, real bacon flavor, lower in fat & calories than home cooked, and just super-convenient.  Toss into mashed potatoes for a kick, sprinkle on baked potatoes, toss into recipes for the richness of bacon flavor without all the frying.  I used to buy a pack of bacon, roll up each strip, and freeze so I'd have bacon available for the infrequent times I wanted to cook with bacon.  I'm pretty picky about flavors, but this stuff meets my needs 99% of the time.  They're 25 calories/serving (Tablespoon) & 2% of RDA for fat & cholesterol.

review/summary: Baking with Brown Rice Flour
review/text: I  like this flour because it has a very fine texture and helps create a soft baked good.  I usually pair it with Bob's Red Mill GF Oat Flour for the best taste, since it can be a bit strong when used alone.  I like this flour not only because it is gluten free, but because it is a lot healthier than white rice flour and the typical highly refined GF flours and starches out there.

review/summary: Good stuff when you can't get the real thing
review/text: This isn't a miracle product that is somehow going to taste exactly like the full 23oz can we have all grown to love.  What it is, is a nice packet of a similar tasting drink that can be had for about half the price and in a convenient size.  Throw a couple of these in your desk at work, and you'll be ready for Arnies any time of the day.  I like mixing it super cold with ice and water, and I use the suggested 16.9oz of fluid.  One nice thing is that Arnold Palmer Lite in the can comes out to be around 150 calories per can.  This is only 5 calories.  When you consider the caloric difference, obviously they aren't going to taste identical, but it is refreshing and somewhat similar.

review/text: That's not to say that the sticks aren't still great tasting, however. I love these things - I usually have 2 or 3 everyday. They are convenient and the cost per serving is considerably lower than the canned or bottled version.<br /><br />Just make sure that you really mix it well, especially if you are stirring it in a cup and not shaking it in a bottle. For example, if you try to mix it with a stirring stick in a cup full of ice, you'll find that a lot of it will end up staying on the bottom of the cup and you won't get the full taste.<br /><br />Also, I *HATE* Splenda, but I can hardly tell that this has it in it.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Arnold Palmer by Arizona.....the best comes in the gallon bottles.  The cans have a slight metallic taste.<br /><br />This is the third best.  The artificial sweetener is probably better than all the sugar (or worse, HFCS), but overall the product is not as tasty.<br /><br />But, it's better than plain water.<br /><br />Also, there is enough in each packet to make 20 oz, perhaps more to your taste.  If you are adding it to a smaller bottle of water, don't use all the powder in the packet.

review/text: I LOVE this stuff!!  The flavor is REALLY good and the little packets make this super easy.  My work has yucky coffee and with a high pressure job, a little extra caffeine is a good thing.  The convenience makes these perfect to use at work.  I dump the stix into a little less than 16.9oz of water since I like a little stronger flavor.  After pouring into the water bottle and shaking it up, I then pour it out into a cup with lots of ice.  The best, most convenient ice tea I ever had with very little calories and no sugar.  This does not taste like "fake sugar" (which I usually dislike).  I can't compare it to the bottles/cans since I have never tried those but this is really good!

review/text: I don't drink as much water as I should. I figure the extra hydration offsets the drawbacks of the artificial sweeteners. This, shaken into a bottle of water, is tasty without being overly sweet. Two tubes is enough to flavor my widemouthed nalgene. The plastic tubes are sometimes hard to open, but that same plastic packaging makes the tubes durable enough to be thrown in my suitcase or purse.
