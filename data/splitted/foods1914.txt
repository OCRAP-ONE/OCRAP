review/summary: Just might be the Best in the West
review/text: I discovered Pear's Coffee two years and I like it better than Starbucks, Peets, Archer Farms, Millstone, or anything Folger's.  My favorite everyday coffee is Cinnamon Nut Swirl--rich and caramely and spunky and delightful--which I drink black and fulltest.  I wouldn't have thought of Omaha as a source of great beans...but here it is!  At holiday times, they have special flavors.  The Chocolate-Raspberry was heavenly.  I've been buying Pear's at the grocery store in small packages.  Was glad to see I could get big bags via Amazon.  Not sure why Consumer Reports in their March 2009 ratings of America's Best Coffee didn't include Pear's.  It is fully as excellent as the top rated Columbian coffee.

review/text: Ever since the movie "Gamer" I had been wanting some pistachio butter. It never really occurred to me that such a thing existed! LOL! But it sounded SO good, that I just couldn't get it out of my head. After a failed local quest to find some, I ordered this 1lb tub - and its freakin delicious. I've been putting it on bagels, crackers, celery, apples - omg its so good on apples - I even threw a scoop into my fruit-n-veggie smoothie - was a fantastic twist! Buy it! It's wonderful!

review/summary: Personally could not taste the pistacio
review/text: In the case of the batch I got, there was an excessive amount of both salt and peanut oil in the mix of pistacio paste.  So much in fact that it destroyed the taste of pistacio completely and I was left with a taste closer to salt and rancid peanuts, there are other brands without the added mixers, perhaps I got a bad batch of paste but there was no pistacio flavor in the paste I recieved at all; which has not been the case with other pastes i've tried- nor did this happen when i've made my own paste without salt and peanut oil as a mixer. Your experience may vary, but there are unsalted pastes available, that do not use peanut oil to excess as a mixer.

review/text: I bought this butter already being a pistaccio lover (or addict). Found myself eating it by the spoonful. Was not too salty not very sweet but very "pistacioie"?<br />Would reccomend to all how enjoy the fruits of pistaccio nuts and any whom just like exploring new flavors and texutures like myself. The butter itself is very thick (actually broke a cheap butter knife while making a sandwich.) and is not as creamy as peanut butter more tiny bits of pistaccio rather than a creamy butter like a super chunky without large chunks. Hope this was helpful. If you've got the money to spend which is roughly 20$ then by all means try this delicacy.

review/text: I think I got a bad batch or something because it was so salty, we couldn't eat it. I mixed it with a very large jar of crunchy peanut butter, added easily a cup of honey, and threw raisins in and was finally able to make use of it. Don't eat this buy itself though. I'd get an unsalted version if there is one. My family loves peanut butter and pistacios, so this should have been a win win, but it wasn't.

review/summary: item is ok but not great
review/text: This item was a bit of a disappointment. I expected better flavor. It has a sour start but that is it. The cherry and soda flavor is very faint and difficult to taste. The texture is what you would expect from a quality gummy, soft and slightly firm but chewy. The sour is spot on, it will make you pucker. e.frutti normally has wonderful products with abundant flavor, sadly this product was not one of them. I ordered 4 bags (8.8 pounds), opened one and ate a few and gave the three remaining bags away to less discriminate gummy consumers. I rated this product low because I expected better flavor and not just sour gummy. If you enjoy sour and are less concerned with flavor, this product may be right for you.

Ice Cubes is by far one of my favorites because the taste lasts much longer than an ordinary stick of gum.  I like Strawberry Smoothie (the only fruity flavored gum out there I like), Spearmint, and Peppermint.  There's a nice rush of flavor crystals for the first 5 minutes.

review/summary: A little pricy but the best gum around... now
review/text: This is the best gum I've found since Hersey discontinued their Koolerz brand several years ago.  (This stuff is also made by Hersey).<br /><br />Both the Spearmint and Peppermint flavors have a nicely combined minty sweetness that lingers for quite a while.  The texture stays "chewably soft" for even longer.  Another thing I really like about this gum, unlink others I've tried, is it doesn't stick to my fillings or crowns and I don't wind up with little pieces between my teeth.<br /><br />The only problem is the investment to get your first sample.  If you can find it in a store, it's not everywhere, one of these packs costs about a dime a piece.  It's much less, per piece, here but buying eight "tubs" (designed to fit in a car cup holder) is a bit if a gamble if you've never tried it.<br /><br />It's great gum and you will probably like it if you like gum.  I was lucky and sat next to a guy in a plane who offered me some.  And, if you should run into me, ask for some because I'll be having some on hand from now on.<br /><br />Please feel free to let Amazon and me know whether this was helpful to you or not, since it helps me improve my reviews.

review/text: I just want to say I feel extremely sorry for Danielle (the previous reviewer) and the people she gave these as gifts to.  For me, this has been wonderful and I intend on buying others.<br /><br />It takes a while, for sure, and what helped with mine was two things:<br />1.) Keeping a plastic bag over the bag the plant is in for an extremely long time, months even.  Once it gets growing...<br />2.) Transferring the plant into a self-watering pot and keeping it in as much sun as possible (I'm an indoor gardener lol).<br /><br />Now, for me, the trick is to get it to STOP growing. :)  Also, the oregano is DELICIOUS.  Anyway, these are cheap enough that I'd say they're worth a go.  I've had great luck with mine.

review/text: No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free "cold pack".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality.

review/summary: I received my M&Ms just fine.
review/text: I ordered the 4 large bags. I received them in a timely manner and appreciated that they were shipped in a minimal amount of packaging. The four bags were simply shrink wrapped together and put in the box with my other items. I have only opened one bag so far but the M&M's were in great condition. Great price, delicious product, excellent service.<br /><br />Edit (10/01/10)- The price for these is now $35 more than when I bought them the first time. I can buy these for less than $10 a bag at the store. So the price is now closer to ridiculous then great.

review/summary: Just What You'd Expect
review/text: A pair of these giant bags of your basic peanut M&M's sort of shrinkwrapped together, for the same price others are selling just one bag.  I took these as a gift for a friend in Italy who hadn't been able to find them there.  I had to pull one out of my suitcase to get it back under the weight requirements and put it in my carryon, no problems with either.  My friend was delighted when they arrived and began snacking happily away immediately.

review/summary: **********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************
review/text: First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats

I mix ONE scoop (a half serving) with another protein powder and milk and coffee... and  YUMMY... I could drink it twice a day easily.

review/summary: A protein drink that is wonderful!
review/text: After having gastric bypass surgery, one needs to be able to get in a lot of protein, and the best way, at the beginning is through protein shakes. Nearly ALL varieties of protein shakes are not palatable for me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. HOWEVER, Click Mocha makes it so good for me. I'm able to make a 16 oz shake every morning with one scoop click, and then one scoop of another brand chocolate protein shake mixed in. This gets me to almost 50 grams of protein, in one shake! And it's wonderful! It does not have the typical protein shake taste, and it doesn't seem too caffeinated. As a person with gastric bypass, I do have to be careful with the caffeine intake because of the potential for an ulcer, but I've been fine. Again, I can't say enough wonderful things about this protein shake, it's absolutely wonderful! And the weight has been DROPPING off now that I've been able to get the appropriate amount of protein in every day.

review/text: So I've been doing P90X and have found that most protein shakes taste like dirty feet. I try and stomach it but have thrown away 3-4 different cans. This product was recommended by a friend and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it didn't taste awful. In fact, it's DELICIOUS. I absolutely love that I've got an option of having it hot or cold. I do have trouble getting it fully blended when it's cold.  I think It's much smoother as a hot beverage and wonderful after a long workout.<br />I would definitely recommend if you're new to the protein shake world and need something that tastes great.

review/summary: Best mixed in a blender!
review/text: Out of all of the protein drinks I have ever had, this one is by far the best.  I have only prepared the drink two ways so far but when it is mixed with water and ice in a blender, it is really good.  When I make it again, I will add my Weight Watchers 2 Points Plus chocolate drink packet.  I will be getting a serving of milk then, too.  For 3 Points Plus a serving, this is a great snack/recovery drink/indulgence.  I have not tried the drink hot and I don't plan on it.  The only drawback I found was when I made the drink with just water (following the directions) I did get a ton of clumps.  I shook the container for about 25 seconds, too.  But, all in all, it is a great drink after a hard workout for some good protein.

review/text: I am preparing for bariatric surgery, so I've been trying a LOT of protein drinks lately.  This is definitely one of my favorites!  I think it's the extra espresso flavor that really kicks it up.  So many of the protein drinks are bland, it's nice to have a little flavor.  One drawback is the price... each drink takes 2 scoops.  Many of the other products only require one scoop to get a decent amount of protein.  So keep that in mind when comparing prices.

review/text: This is the only protein shake I have ever had that tastes like the flavor it's named after. The Syntrex Nectars come close (most of them, anyway), but OMG! I could drink this stuff all day! I mix the powder in 4oz milk, then add 8oz boiling water. No lumps, clumps, or yucky floaters. The stats aren't as good as other protein shakes I drink (12g carbs, 15g protein), but to me, it's worth it, because I would be drinking a Starbucks vanilla latte otherwise.

I find it quite strong (for me), so sometimes I mix it with another protein powder for less caffeine and more protein (a scoop of this one has 15g protein). I'll be buying it over and over, it tastes delicious and doesn't have that weird protein taste some powders have. It's amazing, even if it clumps a little when I don't use the blender and mix it with milk. Expensive for me since I am in Canada, but totally worth it!

review/text: I have tried other protein shakes and have given up on them because they were disgusting and messy. This is the first protein shake that I drink every morning before I go to the gym and I enjoy it. It keeps me from feeling hunger & it gives me the necessary energy to keep going. I especially love to mix milk with a tablespoon of Sugar Free "International delight" & a bit of cooled brewed coffee. Its also makes a great hot coffee drink. The trick so it doesn't get lumpy when heated is to mix the powder as best as you can before putting it in the microwave. Its simply Delicious! I love it! Plus I have signed up to have "Click Espresso Protein Drink" delivered monthly to my door. That way I never run out.

This does have a bit more carbs than some protein but I only have one a day, and it fits in with my carb count for the day. I also prefer mine made with milk (I use Hood Calorie Countdown for the lower carb count) than with water, but it is also good with water. It's also good hot or cold. During the winter, it felt almost like a nice, warm treat when I heated it up according to directions.<br /><br />I get this item by subscribe and save now, two canisters once a month. It's one of my absolute 'must have' items.

review/summary: YUM!!!!  This really is delicious!
review/text: This is worth the try - it is so much healthier than a regular mocha and the chocolate flavor is excellent!  I do recommend using a blender (I use my Magic Bullet) for about 30-60 seconds to blend it all together.  That makes it so creamy you can't tell it was from a powder.  I make this for breakfast every day and I don't get hungry for about three hours, which is AWESOME from something with only 120 Calories!  I've also got my sister hooked on this stuff.  It is really worth the money (especially compared to purchasing a mocha). This tastes sweet and nothing at all like a protein drink.

review/text: Had my first one today - the vanilla latte!  IT was great, especially when the ice was added.  Tasted super and I was really unsure about mixing the powder with water!  Trying to lose weight, but of course, wanted to add it to milk.  Will try the mocha tomorrow.

review/summary: Tasty protein drink for bariatric patients
review/text: Bought this powder at the recommendation of Eggface. It is a great tasting addition to protein shakes or alone, providing much needed additional protein to those of us who need to increase protein intake after weight loss surgery. I add one scoop to my chocolate protein powder, milk and ice with a little sugar free vanilla syrup and it is a delicious meal replacement. My canister is getting low...will be reordering soon!

review/summary: It's Really Good!!!
review/text: I purchased it like two weeks ago and received the product in less than a week. It tastes really good without the chalky taste that most protein shakes leave. I tried the samples first and they were good. I bought this I can mix it with my GNC lean shake and add to the taste, b/c the gnc shake leave an after taste in my mouth so i had to get something to add to it to drown the taste and this does the trick. I don't like the fact that it lacks fiber, but u can add that in if u want with disolvable fiber powder. It's tasty, low in calories, and I will buy again before I run out!!!

review/text: I will admit, I cut this when I use it in the morning (EVERY morning).  I use one scoop of this and one scoop of Matrix perfect chocolate, and drink it hot.  It's amazing.  It's also great for a pick me up later in the day (same combo over ice).  I have a subscription to this product and I get a canister every month.  :)  Sometimes more often than that.  It's a little higher in carbs than I like, but otherwise, versatile,  I use it in drinks, coffees, puddings, ice creams... &lt;3 it. :)

review/summary: Click Vanilla
review/text: I'm a bariatric patient so it's important that I supplement my protein for the rest of my life. Imagine my dismay when I discovered that I couldn't tolerate most protein drinks!<br />I then discovered Click Vanilla (the mocha was too coffee tasting for me).<br />Since a lot of sugars bother me I only use one scoop of Click mixed with one scoop of Any Whey unflavored protein powder. This ups the protein while lowering the sugar grams. To this mixture I add about 1/4 envelope of Diet Swiss Miss with 8-9 ounces of water in a blender cup. After mixing I pour into a coffee mug, microwave for about 1 minute add 1 splenda and a tiny bit of SF creamer, mini moo or SF syrup. This is soooo good! Love the taste, love the little bit of caffeine it gives me but most of all love the fact that it is very healthy for me and a great way to start off my day.<br />Thanks Click for keeping me clickin' along. :)

review/summary: Excellent Protein Mix
review/text: I'm a gastric bypass surgery patient as of 9/1/2010.  I have tried a few protein powders, but I could not stand the taste, the grit, or the overwhelming smell.  This is an answer to my prayers.  I'm mixing it with soy milk (which adds 6 more grams of protein) and either water or coffee and then heating it.  I'm even cutting it with more water or coffee than directed because it is, as almost all of the proteins have been, very strong in flavor.  But, this is a flavor I can stand.  And no icky smell.  I loved my flavored drinks from the coffee houses as well as flavored creamers that I used at home in my coffee.  This pretty much does it for me.  I'm getting closer to making my daily goal of protein intake for the first time since surgery and it does not seem like a hopeless task for me anymore.  Have only had the mocha, but this time I'm ordering more of that as well as the vanilla flavor and I'm looking forward to trying that.

review/summary: VERY good! Does NOT taste like a protein shake!
review/text: First of all, as with ALL protein shakes, you really should test out different amounts of water vs. powder to see what tastes best to you.  I have discovered that I typically like a more watery shake (less powder) than what the manufacturers recommend.  Some people can look at this as a negative, since you would need to drink 2x the liquid to get the same nutritional value for "one serving," but if you're trying to loose weight, sipping throughout the day isn't a bad thing.  As far as this shake goes, using two full scoops taste like a strong version of International Foods Sugar Free Vanilla Latte Instant Coffee.  Anyway, here is what works for me:<br /><br />1.  16oz cold water & a few ice cubes<br />2.  one scoop of Click powder<br />3.  Combine in my 20oz Venti Starbucks reusable cold-cup.  Put lid on without straw, place finger over hole for straw, shake vigorously. Remove lid, replace straw, ENJOY!<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking this shake this way is REALLY delicious and taste just like iced coffee. It does NOT have the typical protein shake flavor and aftertaste at all.  I just wish they made a decaffeinated version so I could drink it all day long!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy this shake hot, but I'm going to continue experimenting with that and update my review accordingly!

review/summary: Awesome coffee flavor!
review/text: I am another gastric bypass patient, always on a search for the best tasting protein supplements. CLICK Vanilla Latte Flavor Protein Drink is the BEST tasting protein I have ever had! Normally, I make my own espresso and mix it with my vanilla protein drink of the day. I always have to add several espresso shots and sugar-free vanilla syrup to get that great coffee-house flavor; not so with CLICK! This tastes as good as any $4.00 latte I've ever had, but with all the additional protein I need to maintain my healthy lifestyle. And the texture is wonderful, no grit or clumps! I have found my morning coffee fix! Thanks, CLICK!!

review/text: I had Gastric bypass a little over a year ago and ever since have been having a really hard time finding a protein drink that agreed with me. Either they tasted completely awful or they made me sick to my stomach. After reading the reviews on Amazon for Click, I ordered the Click Vanilla Latte flavor and crossed by fingers that it would live up to the good reviews. I am here today to say this drink is awesome! There is no heavy protein flavor and it doesn't make me feel sick after drinking it. I would recommend this product to everyone who loves the flavor of a good latte!

The wonderful taste of the Click will make most any other nasty powder bearable!

review/text: I'm a gastric bypass patient and tried many different protein powders until I found Click. Theres no taste of protein. It tastes like an expensive coffee drink and gives me just enough caffiene to get me going in the morning. The only thing that could be better is if it contained more protein. I mix mine with 14 oz milk which adds 14 grams of protein and add 1/3 cup dry nonfat powdered mild which adds another 8 grams of protein. I like this so much that I use Amazons auto shipping option and get two tubs a month with free shipping and a discount.

review/summary: Best Coffee Protein Powder
review/text: I really like this prtoein powder a lot! Although the grams of protein are considerably less than Syntrax Nectar's capuccinno flavor (24g in Nectar vs 15g in Click) Click's taste is far superior!<br /><br />Pros: Taste, taste and taste! Mixes well with other ingedients (I have added fat-free half&half, non-fat milk, peppermint syrup, sugar free vanilla syrup, caramel syrup and all have mixed well with this powder)<br /><br />Cons: Light on protein content, Carbs a little high for those watching carbs, Mixability (many posters agree that it still has lumps even after vigorous shaking/mixing), Volume in the can versus the price (especially if youre someone who consumes one or more of these per day like me...it goes VERY quickly)<br /><br />I have decided to have this on auto-ship (knocks price down to 17.00). Overall a very good option for those of us who love our coffee and need to get some extra protein in!
