review/summary: Good for your cat's health
review/text: When my cat was diagnosed with diabetes (which he no longer has), I went in search of cat food without carbohydrates and found Natural Value. I found out that cats are "obligatory carnivores." They must eat meat to live and they have little use for grains and vegetables. Natural Value has vitamin-added, meat-only food and also has some "loaf" versions that contain rice flour and oat bran as secondary ingredients. And, all Natural Value varieties do not contain meat-by-products. (Meat-by-products are allowed to contain grounded-up euthanized cats and dogs.)<br />Flaked Tuna Supreme is my cat's favorite. If your cat refuses the food you put in front of it, do not give-in. Let it go hungry until it eats the food you have chosen for its health. Remember, you are the one that's supposed to have the "brains."

review/summary: Great Value ~ Great Ingredients
review/text: My cats go wild for this flavor of Natural Value, and I like that the ingredients are just tuna plus vitamins/minerals - no grains.  Great value for the price ~ similar grainless canned foods are anywhere from $1 to over $3 per can, so you can't beat this, especially if your cats like it as much as mine do.

review/summary: Great product but poor packaging
review/text: My cats do enjoy this food but the can is SO hard to open.  The flip tab thing is easy to pry up but it hurts my fingers to use the flip tab to actually pull the top off the can. I do have to pull them open 3 at a time, twice a day for my 3 cats though so maybe it's just me. I wish it came in a pouch or something instead but some sort of packaging that was easily recycled.

review/text: As always, Amazon shipped instantly, beating the estimate by days... The food looks and smells good enough to eat; I'm weaning my nine-year-old cats from kibble to real meat food, and so far THEY are not impressed. I don't know what it takes to push the appetite button for a new food, but it hasn't been pushed yet. (Anyone know the magic word?) I'm sure that someday, they'll thank me...

It is now DRY, and almost impossible to penetrate with a plastic fork. Other 5oz items are fine, as they used to be, so I'm switching to the bigger cans :( I used to like this product for its size, as my cat eats small, but, oh well.

review/summary: Natural Value Chunk Style Flaked Tuna Supreme for cats
review/text: Once a week, since both love it, my two cats were treated with people tuna....chunk style light tuna in water.  Kinda expensive, so bought this product (24 cans for $17.00) and, according to their write-up, assumed they would love it.  Nooooooooo.  It is a very, very dark tuna, quite dry (no liquid).  They won't touch it, unless / until they are starving.  What to do with 22 cans?<br />Mfg. won't accept returns...so, I guess it is $17. down the drain.

review/text: This tuna-based wet food is liked by two picky cats, so it passes the test, but they are not wild about it. I find it the right food for every other day or so, and it helps if they can finish the can in one feeding. I like the idea that it has no additives, so I know I am getting something down them that is not filled with chemicals or fats and grains.

review/summary: My cat hates it now.
review/text: This used to be my cat's favorite treat (it wasn't daily fare).  It used to have a great texture.  Now it is dry and unpalatable.  I agree with Mars' review here. I thought it was maybe just a bad batch but over time it has proven to be either a new formulation or maybe just a less fatty part of the tuna being used.  It is also clear that Natural Value is fraudulently claiming  AAFCO compliance in their formulation.  Under pressure from  misguided pet owners and Internet cranks this manufacturer removed menadione from their fish based formulations. AFFCO requires the use of vitamin K3 (menadione) in any cat food product containing greater than 25% fish on a dry matter basis, and for good reason. I have labels from previous and new cans and the new ones clearly do not list the required vitamin K supplementation.  So, Natural Value is either lying about the actual ingredients or about the AAFCO label statement.  In either case, I can't trust this company anymore.  I used to buy their cat food by the case at Whole Foods.  If your cat happens to like this product, I think it would be OK only as a treat (since it does have a great basic ingredients list), definitely not as a regular entire meal. Even if this were a trustworthy product, it is probably best to limit exposure for cats to apex predators (that accumulate toxins) like tuna anyway.

review/summary: Dry is an understatement!
review/text: My cat that can eat fish loves the Natural Value tuna in the large cans even preferred over Tiki and the Weruva brand tuna mixes.  I thought I would get her some of these small cans just to have on hand.  I opened my first can for her dinner and could not believe the brick, literally, that was inside the can.  I thought maybe I misread the moisture of 84% so I checked it again and sure enough it is the same as the larger cans at 84%.  It is nothing like the larger cans!  I put some in a bowl which was tricky enough because it didn't scoop in, it crumbled in, and put some water on it to see if that would help.  It didn't and my cat walked away.  I coaxed her to at least try it, which she did but was having such a hard time I took it away and gave her some turkey tonight.  I guess I will stick to the larger cans because I will not get these again.  Oh, when I went to put aside the rest of the case to donate it to a shelter, I shook one of the cans to see if they were all like that and instead of hearing any liquid, all I could hear was a thud so I knew it was the same.  Now reading the other reviews I realize this one is just like that.  Not for us.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: I thought I was getting the 5 oz cans, since that is all that was offered when I first subscribed to this cat food brand. My cats will eat the 5-oz. product. I just went ahead and ordered it on subscription. I do not know what they did to it in the 3-oz. version. It is very dry, and even the homeless cats we help will not eat it. They prefer dry food to it.<br />What I am wondering is this: Fish oil supplements for humans is a very lucrative business now. To render the oil from fish requires a technological approach. If you keep improving the technique, the fish residue eventually has so little oil that a cat might not be able to detect it. The "food" would be produced from fresh fish, as advertised, and would allow the manufacturer to receive a revenue from the residue as well as the human supplement. My cats much prefer canned cat food normally. This came to mind when I saw them smell it and ignore it as if it were cardboard.

review/summary: I wish I would've known!
review/text: I checked out the ingredients for these products on 2 websites and nowhere did it mention MSB (menedione sodium bisulfate).  Four of the varieties have that synthetic vitamin K in them and I will not give that to my pets.  If I would have known that, and wanted to give that to my cats, I could have gotten the Natural Value brand for less than 1/2 the price!  I thought I could pay more to give them a different type of food for variety that did not include a synthetic ingredient under the label of "all natural".  This chemical builds up in their systems and in tests has caused lesions on the internal organs.  Even animals who weren't given it all the time, had it in their systems when they died.  Do your research and google "Menedione sodium bisulfate" for a wealth of information.  By the way, Natural Value does add it to their small cans of food but it isn't in the pate formulas or the larger cans of tuna, which they now offer at Amazon on subscribe and save.  I will give my cats the ones that don't contain this harmful ingredient, but won't buy this configuration again.<br />UPDATE: 4-3-2011<br />I sent a letter with my concerns to Petropics, the maker of this food, and I was pleasantly surprised to get a response within 24 hours!  They are now making this food, all the varieties, without MSB.  I was not only impressed with the company, but also thrilled that they are making it without the synthetic.  My cats love it and that makes me justify the price.  It is a little higher, but actually it is still in the ballpark.

review/text: My cat has a problem with chicken in cat food. There are many premium brands of cat food that contain chicken in some way: chicken meal, chicken meat,chicken liver etc. and my cat cannot have any of that. She gets very, very sick. With Tiki variety packs, there is NO chicken in any form in the ingrediant list. She just goes crazy whenever I put it in her bowl! It doesn't matter which flavor I choose, she just loves it! I highly recomend it to any cat owner who has a cat that is choosy about what he/she eats due to food allergies or who wants something better for their cats than Friskies or Purina or other grocery store brands that are on the market.

review/summary: My Boys Sent This Back To The Kitchen
review/text: But I still believe it is an excellent cat food, for the right kind of cat.  Tiki Cat is definitely a top of the line cat food: I opened up one can to find a perfectly round ring of calamari resting atop succulent morsels of fish.  My problem is that when I ordered this variety pack I neglected to keep in mind that my boys don't really care for wet food that comes in chunks or even flakes.  They are the kind of dudes who enjoy their wet food in a pate or souffle form.  So although they slurped down the gravy in these cans, they left all the chunky bits behind and then glared at me as if to say: "You don't expect us to chew this, do you?"<br /><br />Tiki Cat comes in big juicy chunks that look good enough for people to eat, and if that's the way your cat likes wet food, then I think this will be a delectable dining option for them.  I just wish they made a nice pate style for my boys because I think they'd really respond better.<br /><br />ETA: There is a feral cat, named Spanky, who comes by for a meal quite often.  I have given him some of the leftover cans of Tiki Cat and he **loves** it.  He licks the bowl clean and then sits in the sun for a nice long bath. Spanky is polydactyl, so he can and does give Tiki Cat "two thumbs way, way up."

review/text: My 2 indoor cats enjoy the Weruva Brand canned cat foods. Weruva only has a couple flavors that are their least favorites, so I don't get those too often. I ordered this Tiki Cat Variety Pack to try out. The variety pack is over 1/2 gone but the only flavor my cats would eat so far is the Honolulu Luau Tuna (tuna, rice, crab surimi) in the purple can. They did not like any of the flavors that came in two's in this variety pack. I have 4 flavors left to try - the Waikiki Luau (tuna rice with tilapia), Molokai Luau (tuna rice on calamari), Bora Bora Luau (sardine cutlets) and the Makaha Luau (mackerel & sardine). With my cats, they like the Weruva canned food the best. I also recently tried out a can of Addiction Safari Buffalo Meatloaf Canned Cat Food which they both devoured. None of these canned cat foods stink horribly by the way.

Every time I would try something new, I got the cat version of "ain't gonna happen in any of my 9 life times."<br /><br />Then we tried Tiki Cat Luau varieties.  Now, the cats are ready to put me on a pedestal.  What a nice change from the normal life of the cats' chief of staff.<br /><br />I have five cats. I thought there might be at least one flavor which wasn't appreciated, but I was mistaken.  I have 5 mewling, begging, talking, figure-eighting, how fast can you get it in my bowl, cats each morning. Even my husband noticed the texture and natural ingrediants which are readily identifiable.<br /><br />Five paws up.

review/text: Recently, after reading about nutrition for cats, I've started being concerned about the grain content in the food my cats eat. Both are quite healthy and active. To provide good quality protein rich foods for my cats, I was dreading having to cook for them (I don't cook too much for myself either). I visited the local Animal Feeds and Needs to explore other healthy food options. As of now I've found 2 brands that my cats like and are good for them (I think) - Tiki Cat and Weruva. I feed them kibble in the day and keep some out at night too. But at night, I feed them Tiki Cat or Weruva.<br />1. The food in the cans looks like real pieces of shredded fish and a jelly like gravy - not processed chunks of some unrecognizable mush.<br />2. The cats start meowing as soon as I pop a can open and love it. :) :) :)<br />3. I add a little bit of water in and mix it up well with a spoon. I like the idea that they get more liquid in this way.<br />4. I don't need to cook for the kitties. And they still get yummy, healthy food.<br />Perfect.. or should I say Purrrfect!!

No "mystery meat", no paying for or having him ingest sketchy fillers - no questioning "what *EXACTLY* is a BY PRODUCT !?! - *shudder*......"<br /><br />Inside the Tiki Cat can you'll find what looks like a tiny restaurant takeout container for kitties - layered nicely, chunks of real seafood, looks and smells good!

review/summary: Variety is the spice of life.
review/text: It seems that Tiki Cat food is the only cat food my cat will eat. I have tried other brands that say natural, human grade, etc., but my cat wont eat them. Usually, despite these claims, the food comes in a pate style format which is not "natural". With Tiki, if the label says tuna & chicken, or tuna & prawns, you see actual pieces of the items, not a mish mash pate. My cat looks at her food bowl, then looks up at me and meows for me to give her something else. So, I put back any variety of Tiki, and she eats it. Also, do we eat the same thing every day all day long, so why should your cat? She seems to like the variety, or at least the slight variations. I only wish that Tiki did actually make more varieties than variations on tuna, like turkey.

review/text: My 9 year old cat, Lupita, has always been a problem eater.  She'll lap at food, and walk away.  Imagine my surprise when she lapped this food, and then hung around to chew some up!  She continues to do this, with every single kind!  We have five cats, and they are all jealous of the scent, when I feed Lupie.  I let them finish after her, and they're thrilled about it.  If I had more money, I'd feed it to them all.  I wish I could visit the place where they cook this food.  It smells heavenly!  I'm thinking of tasting it ... :)  Thank you, Amazon!

review/summary: Food you can recognize
review/text: Growing up my cats were raised on grocery store pet food that, upon opening a can, was unrecognizable as food. It just looked like a oozing brown sponge of muck. And it would come with the most horrendous smell that seemed closer to manure than food. Tiki Cat is nothing like that. When I open the can I both recognize the fishy parts and it smells like seafood. There's also plenty of gravy, which my cats lap up. Even though I've mainly switched them to a raw food diet, there's always the once in awhile morning or evening where the raw food hasn't thawed yet or some other mishap. It's good to have quality canned cat food my cats love as a back up.<br /><br />The first ingredient is water. The second is fish, which is good for pet food. They're always ordered by the largest quantity first. It always amazes me when I pick up cat food that doesn't have meat listed first or second. Cats are carnivores! Meat should be the largest percentage of their diet, not grain. I love this pack has a ton of different varieties of fish, not just tuna or salmon, so that my cats get more diversity and nutrients in their diet.

review/summary: Mixed Review From the Family
review/text: A mixed review from the cat family... They loved some of the gloppy varieties, but when I opened a can of "cutlets" it freaked us all out as it's big fish chunks, bones and all. I was alarmed picturing that puked up on my bed. My 16-year-old looked at it and me as though I'd gone completely mad and backed away from the dish, as did a younger cat. Noble effort, Tiki Cat, and sorry, but they want their glop. The "cutlets" have gone to the outdoor feral tomcats we care for, who thought it was magnificent, but it's a bit too pricey for them to have regularly.<br /><br />**Added: An enthusiastic 5-stars from the cat family on the salmon-chicken variety:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0MFX0">TIKI Cat Canned Food for Cats, Napili Salmon Chicken Recipe  (Pack of 12 2.8 Ounce Cans)</a>

review/summary: About time!
review/text: I have an exotic Cat Breed and have tried all the expensive organic dry foods as she has a sensitive system. The litter box was horrendous and left us all wanting to leave the house for hours! Plus her BMs were so runny and even had blood in it, which the vet said was due to the harshness of the food. So I went to wet food. Ideally I would love to serve Raw but I just don't have the time, so i started out with the Big Name super market brands, but not only did they make her box worse, they were unappetizing to even look at. just mush! So I went to the local mom and pop pet store and looked around. I found a couple cans of Tiki cat and for under a buck each so I said Why not. I took it home, gave her one and we are hooked! I love that its real fish with no added JUNK. You can see and smell whats in it. My cat meows for this! I did not buy from Amazon but I do get the multipack auto shipped through another site. I wish they would expand their fish flavors though, seems to be mostly Tuna and Sardines (which are rather chunky so she sometimes has an issue chewing them), but Im just happy that her poo is actually normal, virtually smell free, and she seems so much more active and playful!

First ingredient on the latest can fed (Tuna on Rice w/Tilapia) does indeed state Tuna, then water, brown rice, white fish, no by-product. I wouldn't eat "crude protein" or "crude fiber", but this is a step in the right nutritional direction for my cat, away from exclusive dry foods.

review/text: This is a great sampler pack to find out which flavors your cats love-- mine loved them all-- or to keep mixing things up so they don't get bored.<br /><br />My cats go nuts for this stuff. They see me go near the can and they can't help meowing in excitement. It is, on the whole, one of the best brands, but also one of the most expensive. There are a lot of choices, and one of the best parts about it is that they have recognizable pieces of food in there. It's not just nondescript mush. I loved that part!<br /><br />However, when I came home the other night, our apartment smelled like *death* and it took me just a few minutes to discover that the culprit was the open can I had fed them about two hours previously. I've never had that issue with other cat food brands in such a short time. So if you choose to feed your cats this, please remember to rinse the cans as soon as you're done.

review/text: This stuff is a little pricey for a full-time wet food diet, but if you free-feed your cats on a quality dry food it makes for an excellent dinnertime treat. I recommend you buy the smallest variety package to see which flavors your pets like and then buying those flavors in bulk. My two kittens enjoyed every flavor except the rice/tilapia combo, which was greeted with nonchalance from one and vomiting from the other. But they would beg and try to climb my pantlegs for the sardines and the calamari, so those two will be the ones I order next.

I highly recommend the brand, especially for picky kitties.  The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that the variety pack doesn't include more of the available flavors.  Cats may not mind but it makes me feel like a better cat mom when I change things up a bit.

review/summary: Cats love it.
review/text: I had been looking for (as natural) type of cat food as possible for my two cats.  I found this and they absolutely love it.  Between the tiki pet food and the evo innova, my older cat is not as grouchy, his fur looks even shinier and he actually sort of plays...well for him in any case.  They loved the sardines.  They loved all the cans.  They will sit at their bowls and meow at me...wanting the canned food (they get the canned food twice a week.)  I got my mom and sister to try their cats on it, and they also love this cat food.  The food has chunks of fish in it and thin strips of different veggies.  Your cat really will love this food.  As close to what they would get in nature as most indoor cats are going to get.  I have been thinking about switching the cats to wet food and delete the dry food altogether.  I am not sure how much wet food they would get in one day.  Seems to me that would be the proper diet, seeing as they are meat eaters in nature, with some grass thrown in every once in awhile.<br />In any case, this cat food is really great.  I will continue to purchase this for my cats.

The Tiki cat she walked away from and I could not say I blamed her. The tuna (all of them) was a nasty red dead color and like mash. I guess she is not used to food that looks like or smells like that. Soulstic foods have mostly white meat tuna in chunks not mush, and Weruva is also chunks. Sorry Tiki cat Bella gives you a paws down!<br />Tiki cat King Kamehameha although says it is a variety, however it is mostly tuna flavors, they are juicy and mushy, not chunky and gelled. They do not look appealing.

review/text: This is just what I wanted: a cheap sample pack of fun, and healthy, new flavors for my cat to try.  I try to feed her mostly chicken and turkey as her base food because I think of fish as more of a treat than a staple, and trying new things encourages her to eat during the day when I leave for work.<br /><br />The first type she tried was the Mackerel and Sardines.  She loved it!  She's partial to the tuna, though- scarfs the tuna down in about 10 minutes.<br /><br />I feel good feeding her real food that she enjoys.  I did find bones in the can, but they break down when you touch them so I'm not worried about her ingesting them (extra calcium? haha).<br /><br />UPDATE 10/18/12<br />She hates the Sardines, but likes every other flavor.

review/summary: Really good, but ...
review/text: I've always liked Knorr products and this is no exception. The boullion dissolves effortlessly in liquid and the flavor is wonderful. There are a lot of different ways to use boullion as a flavoring agent and I'm not shy about experimenting. It was fortunate, however, that I took a closer look at the ingredients list on the label -- the fourth item on the list is monosodium glutamate! I have no problem with MSG myself but I have friends who suffer different degrees of allergic reaction to it, one in particular who becomes very ill.<br /><br />I'll have to be very careful when and if I use this boullion when I'm having company for meals. Had I known of the MSG content, I wouldn't have made the purchase, much as I like the product otherwise. Given the publicity about MSG sensitivity, I feel Knorr should have shown a clear warning at the point of sale at Amazon. One can't read ingredient labels online, more's the pity. That's why I knocked a star off the score.<br /><br />So count this as a warning: if you or those you'll be feeding can't handle MSG, don't buy this boullion. Otherwise, it's really good.

review/text: I use this (and the beef flavor) more as a seasoning than a soup. Great for stews and such -- even with beef dishes I often use the chicken flavor. Goes in with stuffing recipes. Can replace some or all of the salt for different recipes.<br /><br />I do use the chicken as a soup base -- I usually make the soup with black pepper, dill, and lemon juice as seasonings, and sometimes add a bit of milk for creamier soup. Also sometimes mix in the low-sodium broth powder as well to get great flavor without over saltiness.<br /><br />The granules allow you to use as little or as much as you need. Price here at Amazon is a deal since I do use enough of this for the 12-pack.

And I was like "I'm gluing a bunch of flank steaks together to make a vest. what does it look like I'm doing". The meat glue was easy to use and bonded the separate flank steaks together almost seamlessly. The resulting vest was quite sturdy and surprisingly water proof. I'm not sure if the glue had anything to do with that, or if meat is just naturally water proof. All I can say for sure is that the meat vest served its purpose, and I am happy with my purchase of this product. Anyone looking to glue separate pieces of meat together, for whatever the reason, might consider this product.

Liquid packets don't taste the same and can be crushed, leading to an unholy mess.  The envelopes or packets are great to carry in a pocket or computer bag (my wife carries them in her purse) for when you go out, and for travel they can't be beaten.  The only bad thing is to find someone who sells them.  The creamer comes in Original, French Vanilla, and Hazelnut, but try to find ONE distributor who carries all three, and good luck!!!<br /><br />Bob Morton

review/text: I grew up in Africa and they sold this delicious curry powder. I'm so happy I can now order it online at amazon since I used to have to order it from Canada. No ingredients are listed but I'm sure it has Coriander, Turmeric, Mustard, Cumin, Chillies, Fenugreek, Pepper and Curry Leaves. At least that is how it tastes. This is the curry I've always used to make curried eggs and curried chicken. Here is a recipe my grandmother taught me to make. The medium curry powder works perfectly in this recipe.<br /><br />Curried Chicken Casserole<br /><br />To save time use precooked chicken breast. You can usually find it<br />on the refrigerated isle along with deli meats and cheese.<br /><br />2 (6-ounce) packages oven roasted carved chicken breasts<br />1 large head broccoli, use tops only<br />1 cup sliced mushrooms<br />1/2 cup chopped yellow onion<br />1/4 cup freshly chopped parsley<br />1 can cream of celery soup<br />1 can cream of chicken with herbs soup<br />1/2 cup fat-free milk<br />2 teaspoons curry powder<br />1/4 teaspoon freshly ground Tellicherry peppercorns<br />1/4 teaspoon garlic salt<br />1/4 teaspoon paprika<br />1 teaspoon lemon juice<br /><br />1 cup shredded cheddar cheese<br />2 cups French Fried Onions<br /><br />1. In a 5-quart saut&eacute; pan filled with boiling water, cook the broccoli for 10-15<br />  minutes.<br /><br />2. Add the mushrooms, onion and parsley and simmer for another 5-10 minutes.<br />  Drain and place in a 13 x 9 x 2-inch glass baking dish. Add the chicken, cut up<br />  into cubes. This is easily done with a scissors.<br /><br />3. Preheat the oven to 350�.<br /><br />4. In a large bowl, blend together the celery soup, cream of chicken soup, milk,<br />  curry powder, pepper, garlic salt, paprika and lemon juice.<br /><br />5. Pour the curry sauce over chicken and vegetables. Stir just until well blended.<br /><br />6. Bake for 30 minutes then top with cheese and French fried onions and bake an<br />  additional 10 minutes.<br /><br />  Makes 4-6 servings

review/text: These are the yummiest flour tortillas I have ever tasted. They taste like they are freshly made at your favorite Mexican restaurant. However the price listed here is ridiculous. After shipping you are looking at $23. Are they worth it? Yes, if you have money to burn and you want fresh tasting tortillas without having to make them yourself. However, I picked these same guys up at Costco for $6.99 or so a package. I bought two packages and stuck one in the freezer. Unless you are desperate skip these guys and find a warehouse store that carries them.

You just toss them on an iron skillet with no spray or anything, flip them over after they form bubbles, cook a few seconds more, and you have the closest thing to home made tortillas I have ever tasted.

review/summary: How to say "Yummy" in Spanish?
review/text: I found these by accident.  I WAS shopping for tortillas, but never dreamed I'd find them in a raw state.  They taste so good when you cook them yourself; rather than simply reheating the store bought, 'cooked' ones.  Why didn't I ever think of this before?  And they freeze wonderfully - although package recommends against it; it worked out well for me.  DON'T microwave however, that's a bad idea. Be patient and cook the tortilla on a griddle or cast iron skillet; it only takes about three minutes to get puffy, big, brown blisters ... how do you say "Yummy" in Spanish?  Well worth the time and money.  They are HOME MADE.  I'll be hard pressed to find a tortilla I like as much.  Muchos Gracias, Tortilaaland!

review/text: We moved from Colorado to Massachusetts and have been in a serious Mexican food withdrawal stage for almost a year.  My husband and I reasoned that if we could get the basic ingredients for a Mexican meal, we could make restaurant-quality food at home.  So, we tried these tortillas in our quest for ingredients resembling those that we could get out west.  These tortillas are so good!  We can't get enough and there's always a package open in our refrigerator (we freeze the unopened ones).  These have helped us cope with our longing for real Mexican food.  They're worth every penny.

None of the Costco in New Jersey carried it,so I tried Amazon.com and found it. It is more expensive, but I have no choice. Uncooked tortilla can be cooked as crepe with chocholate coating and sliced banana and strawberry, or, cooked for lunch with any of your favorite fillings. My favorite is thinly sliced roast beef, spices, and fresh roman lettuce.

review/summary: Very nice sipping vodka
review/text: Many of us have experienced vodka from our youth, where it was popular for mixed drinks.  Having good taste was about paying a little more to minimize the impact in the morning.  We wouldn't notice the taste differences when used for mixed drinks, or drunk as frozen shots, often drunk quickly.<br /><br />We went to a vodka tasting recently that featured 5 vodkas of varying prices and made from different ingredients.  We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home from the local store (thirty-two dollars).<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.  It is difficult to describe, but I imagine that someone who appreciates dry brandies might enjoy it.<br /><br />Because this is about flavor, you would not use Karlsson Gold in mixed drinks.  You probably would not taste the difference, and it costs more than less flavorful but otherwise good brands.<br /><br />These are first impressions.  I'll update the review in a few months, or when the bottle goes dry, whichever comes first, and give my thinking then.

review/summary: Good Tasting Sugar Free Dip/Topping - Recommended
review/text: The Walden Farms Marshmallow Dip was a good find for me, but perhaps calling this "Marshmallow" was a mistake since it only slightly resembles marshmallow by looks and taste. It should be treated as a dessert dip/topping for dieters or diabetics. Being a Type 2 diabetic, I am always looking for low carb sweets that will not impact my blood sugar levels and this Dip/Topping has no impact at all.<br /><br />I like the flavor and use it on other sugar free foods to round out the dish. This works well with sugar free chocolate ice cream and with peanut butter sandwiches.<br /><br />Recommended, if you set your expectations to match the reality that this is not really marshmallow.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

I have tried several other chai green tea brands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co-workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea.

Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).<br /><br />I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this.

review/summary: This tea is a mixture of different spices
review/text: Although this tea is flavorful and tastes fine, I should have read the description more carefully. I was looking for pure licorice root tea. This tea has other spices added to it and the orange peel flavor is dominant and licorice flavor is muted. I am giving it three stars because the name of the tea should include some of the other spices. Read the ingredients listed before you purchase. Here is the description, "Combined with a touch of cinnamon, orange peel and other carefully selected herbs and spices" If you like these other spices then you will be happy. Otherwise, you might opt for a pure licorice tea and the box will say, "Ingredients: Licorice Root". That was what I really wanted, although this tea tastes perfectly good.

review/summary: this is divine!!
review/text: Really do love the flavor of licorice, with this tea I can get that without the  sugar.  It is naturally sweet. The licorice flavor doesn't intensify with longer steeping time so if you want tht flavor to be more intense you have to use two bags.  My husband hates this tea though, he is Japanese and it reminds him of the herbal tonics they made him drink as a kid! More for me...!<br />I also like the Yogi Throat Cure tea, similar flavor but has cherry bark.

review/summary: Not the Best
review/text: I didn't expect this to be so spicy! It smells great but when you taste it, it's nasty! I sweetened it as much as I could but it just didn't help. This is a shame since I like so many other Yogi teas. I'll have to pawn off the rest to friends and family now :(

review/summary: My absolute favorite
review/text: I love this tea. Spicy sweet,  If your first pick in the chocolate aisle is the one with the hottest chili nibs, this is your no-calorie alternative.<br />However, we must talk about the price on Amazon.  I'm searching the site because I first encountered the tea while on vacation in New York City.  Fairway carries it for about half the price of listed here.

review/summary: Great for iced tea!
review/text: Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually "coconut-ty.")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one.

review/text: This tea has a nice light coconut flavor.  It's hard to find in the stores where I live so purchaing it at Amazon makes sense.

review/text: My husband puts Tabasco on everything eggs to pizza and absolutely loved this Mexican chili tea.  I took one sip and wanted to wash the spice off my tongue, but knew exactly why it appealed to him.  I'm sticking with Earl Grey.

review/summary: Great warming flavor on a dreary day
review/text: My absolute favorite Yogi tea!  Pleasantly spicy, with a hint of rich chocolate.  I much prefer this to the Mayan Cocoa Spice & Sweet Thai flavors.  It's what I reach for when I get a craving for a cup of hot chocolate but don't want the calories.

review/summary: Great for a sore throat
review/text: My mom gave me licorice tea whenever I had a bad throat, and it really was soothing to my throat.  This works just as well!<br /><br />Now, if you really really dislike the flavor of licorice, you might want to stay away from this tea.  I don't typically like licorice (I can tolerate it), but this isn't too bad.  Sometimes I drink it just for the scent and flavor.

review/text: I got this as a free sample and I couldn't believe how delicious it is. It sounded so strange so I had to try it right away. It wasn't spicy but had many layers of flavor. I don't even think there are chilis in it!

review/summary: Flavorless
review/text: I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added, essentially. Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes, there was no depth to the flavor. I finished the cup, but I certainly wouldn't buy it.

review/summary: A rollercaoster of flavor!
review/text: When you read Mexican Sweet Chili, you think hot! Well this tea while being tangy and hot also delivers alot of unique flavors. A great wake-up or finish to a spicy meal.<br />Clove, Cardamon, Cinnamon then black Pepper and Red Chili flavors, a unique cup of tea. Would be excellent Iced or with milk. I will reorder & reorder, this one a keeper.

review/summary: Good Tea but not Thai...
review/text: So I bought this tea thinking it was the same as the Thai tea that is served at Thai Restaraunts but its not. This tea is very coconutty which theres nothing wrong with that but its not the same restaraunt type if thats what youre looking for. You should buy this tea if youre looking for a cinnamon/coconut exotic tea.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I love the Yogi brand of Chai tea...whether it's the Redbush or Green tea.  It has so much more flavor than other brands of Chai tea and I have tried a ton of varieties.  I like to make the tea strong and then add some soy milk to it to make it creamy.  It becomes a Chai Latte without all of the sugar you get from the Chai syrups used in coffee shops.  It's also good cold.

review/summary: lots of flavours in each sip
review/text: A colleague at work just gave me one of these tea bags.<br /><br />I like herbal teas but this one was really unique.<br />There were really nice lingering flavors on my tongue with every sip.<br />First, a tangy orangey sensation followed by a suttle sweetness married with a spicy masala kick shortly after.<br />The sweetness lingers around the back of the tongue afterwords.<br /><br />Nothing really Mexican about it, neither does it have any chilis. The spiciness comes from some common spices used in Masala tea.<br /><br />If this sounds like something you might like, I highly recommend that you try it.
