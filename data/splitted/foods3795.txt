review/summary: A healthy Cinnabon
review/text: This is a yummy, healthy cinnamon bar for on the go people.  Cinnamon actually slows the insulin levels down when consuming sugary foods, so it's always good to include in a snack.  I would buy this bar again.  I love that it is just raw food - not cooked or processed much more than grinding it up.

review/text: Lara Bars are tasty, convienient and a wonderful way to get raw foods into your diet.<br /><br />I travel quite a bit and purchasing food in the airport is not as healthful as I wish.  Lara Bars are there in a pinch.  The Apple Pie flavor is very like an apple pie.

review/summary: One of the BEST bars and flavors
review/text: I absolutely LOVE the Chocolate Cononut Chew Larabars!  I have tried most of the larabar flavors and the taste and texture are delicious with all the flavors I have tried.  This is my absoulte fav with only 5 all natural ingredients.  My second choice is the pecan pie larabar.  Almost as good as this one.  I eat one for breakfast and then follow with a light mid-morning snack.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious and satisfying
review/text: This item came up in a gold box recommendation and I took a chance.  While a bit more expensive than the Cliff Bars I had been buying, these were an absolute treat and I plan to purchase more.  The all-natural raw foods approach makes for the best snack bar I've ever had - delicious, not over-sweetened, no sticky aftertaste, not too dry, and one bar was often the perfect mid-afternoon snack to carry me over until dinner.  I tried the chocolate version and found it a little too dry for my taste, but similarly well flavored.

review/summary: Really good product
review/text: I am taste testing the Larabars, and the Cashew Cookie bars are wonderful - they have the consistency of the canned Halvah that you get in the gourmet stores, but has a cashewy taste.<br />Of all the flavors I have tried, the Pecan Pie, the Cinnamon Roll, and the Cashew are my favorites.<br />The least favorites - Cherry Pie, Ginger Snap, and Banana.<br />The Apple Pie is good, but blander than the other flavors. The Chocolate Coconut is good, but the coconut flavor isn't as prominent, though it is worth getting.<br />Also if you have seen the Larabar site, they also have Maya Chocolate Bars - I got some, and my first taste was what I can only describe as 'turpentiney' - do not bother.<br />But these Larabars are a great meal replacement, or snack, and oh so healthy -<br />and a great price with Amazon.

review/summary: Delicious Snack/Energy Bar without That Nasty Fake Sweetener Taste
review/text: I'm on the go and trying to keep healthy and fit by making sure I eat at regular intervals. I tried the "energy" bars and "nutrition" bars, but they all have fake sweeteners with that nasty aftertaste. Saw these in the grocery store and picked up a few different flavours. WOW!! All natural ingredients, taste fantastic.<br /><br />And, even though they look small compared to other bars on the shelf, they REALLY fill me up -- all the protein in the nuts and the raw ingredients I think. I even got my picky boyfriend to eat one when we were hiking, and now he steals mine!<br /><br />I would heartily recommend these to anyone looking at any kind of snack or nutrition bar.

review/summary: Great, but be weary of the dates!
review/text: I love this product, the pecan and apple pie flavors are TO DIE FOR! They are delicious, healthy, and they're the perfect little snack to keep in my bag for after the gym. BUT BE AWARE, many of the flavors (like the chocolate, cinnamon roll, and cherry pie) are all over powered by the flavor of dates. They're not bad, but there is nothing else you can taste in those flavors besides dates and nuts. I would buy one to try before investing in a whole box of the flavor you're looking for.

review/summary: Good lemon flavor,no potassium punch.Back to the lab.
review/text: The creators of this flavor (in the excellent larabar line of energy bars) got the lemon flavor perfect;but why did they leave out the potassium common in most other selections?The potassium is what makes the good "well being" feeling after you have digested this wonderful fiber heavy food and without that you get a curious hollow feeling when you are supposed to be humming.That is Humm Foods goal, after all.I wonder what lara was thinking about with this one flavor?I would suggest a re-working of the lemon selection to incorporate more minerals.( especially the potassium).Otherwise, these are great bars; the cherry pie and cinnemon roll are the best ,followed by banana cookie,pecan pie,and apple pie of the flavors I have tried.But as everyone knows, most no other opinion is more subjective than taste.

review/summary: This is what a really healthy snack bar is ....
review/text: I think that this series of Larabar is what a real healthy snack should contain. If you look at the ingredients on all of this series of Larabars, then you'll see that it has only 3-4 ingredients like the fruit itself, dates and some form of nuts. It doesn't have sugar, salt or other preservatives. Because of the dates, it has natural sweetness and because of the nuts, it has natural saltiness. The nuts also give this bar it's calories (an average bar is about 200 calories).  The taste is well ... not like eating a Nature Valley snack bar. The taste is more like eating mashed fruit and nuts mixed together with dates. If you don't like dates or have a thing against dates, I wouldn't buy any of this series of Larabars because 90% of them have dates as a main ingredients. I think they use it as a natural binder. Because of this, I find that a majority of their bars taste kind of the same ... heavily flavored with dates.<br /><br />But, if you're trying to snack healthily and want to avoid processed foods and those sugary / salty snacks in the "snack bar" aisle at the supermarket, this is the bar to go with. Plus, if you buy it in bulk from Amazon, it comes out to be less than $1.25 / bar whereas at the markets it can go as high as $2.00+ / bar.  You just need to go the market and try all the flavors first before you commit to 16 bars of the same flavor at Amazon. It would suck to order 16 bars of a flavor and find out that you can stand the taste of it after the fact.

review/text: First of all, if you haven't tried Larabars yet, you're missing out!  All of their flavors taste just like their names.  Before I tried the Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip, my favorite flavor Larabar was Key Lime Pie (it tastes just like real key lime pie but is so much better for you!)  What first impressed me about Larabar is that I can pronounce all of their ingredients.  What next impressed me was that my picky 3 year old would eat them! He's now 5 and these are still his favorite snack.  Perfect way to get him some healthy, natural calories when he won't eat anything else.  These are my favorite breakfast, and they're best refrigerated.  They're a staple in our house.  Highly recommend!

I've very please with them both, but I didn't have unrealistic expectations for them. We, socially, have his idea that for example if we're unwrapping the lemon bar it's going to be bright yellow, vibrant, and very lemony. Not the case. They come out brown and nutty with a light, fragrant lemon flavor. The apple pie is the same. Unwrapped it is a brownie sized cut of brown apple pulp with ample nuts mixed in; very simple, tasty, and meets my need for a quick boost of fruit that won't immediate spoil like buying the freshest of produce might.

review/summary: Healthy RAW Snack
review/text: Some people say these are a high fat , high calorie , high glycemic , glorified candybar. I say otherwise. Concerning fat, not all fats are equal , some being healthy . Since this bar is raw all of the fat,protein and sugar have not been denatured  which means you get the full health benefit. As far as being high calorie , considering how nutrient dense these babies are I don't consider 200 calories high in calories at all. For me 200 calories is a perfect number allowing it to be used an nutrient dense snack or a quick meal on the go.<br /><br />Concerning these supposedly being high glycemic , sure , if you were to eat the dates in these by themselves it would be , but the nuts in them bring the glycemic load of the entire bar way down , which is another benefit of the healthy fats in these bars , it allows for the sugars to be released slower and for it to digest slower making you feel full and satisfied longer.<br /><br />As far as these not being any better than a candybar I say noway! No preservatives, no high fructose corn syrup , etc, in these babies , just a healthy combo of fruit and nuts. How many nutrients does a candybar have ? Now look at the nutrient in these , loaded with minerals . Also, unlike many other foods these aren't naturally low in nutrients and then "fortified" with man made vitamins and minerals to make them then appear healthy. All the nutrients in these are naturally occuring which gives you the benefits in a synergistic way where other healthy compounds such as flavonoids and phenols work together with naturally occurring vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />People need to let go of the old dogma which makes them think all fat is bad but if it's sugar free then it MUST be good. If that were true then cotton candy , pepsi and skittles would all be great for ya !Fruit and nuts makes for a good healthy breakfast or snack. I'll eat my greens/green smoothies in the other meals of the day. A person shouldn't eat only fruit and nuts during the day but they shouldn't only eat greens either . These bars help make it easy to strike a balance in your diet on the go. Larabars, Pure bars , SmartMonkey bars and ThinkOrganic bars are all healthy brands of raw bars that amazon sells and all worth a try . Experiment and see what flavors you like best , or make your own !

review/summary: Some GREAT Some HORRIBLE overall i'm HOOKED!!!
review/text: Tropical Fruit Tart<br />5 Stars<br />This bar is very refreshing with a wonderful fruit and citrus flavor and soft chewy texture.<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough<br />2 Stars<br />I'm not a fan of this flavor. The bar would be much better without the chocolate chips that somehow leave a funny aftertaste.<br /><br />Coconut Cream Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Oh my I do love coconut, and this bar was better then I expected it to be. Wonderful texture and not too chewy. This would be a great replacement for the raspberry coconut zingers I'm addicted to!<br /><br />Cinnamon Roll<br />3 Stars<br />This one didn't blow me away or disappoint so I am giving it an average review. The bar was a little harder then I would have preferred and the Cinnamon flavor could have been stronger. It should just be called Cinnamon as it does not have any flavors that could hint as being a healthy bar flavored like a cinnamon roll. If you like cinnamon you will probably like this bar but if you are indifferent to cinnamon I would skip this one.<br /><br />Cashew Cookie<br />3 Stars<br />This one's ok... Good texture, not nearly the amount of cashew flavor I expected for something called "Cashew Cookie", and it almost had a stale flavor even though it was eaten well before the best by date.<br /><br />Peanut Butter Chocolate Chip<br />5 Stars<br />This bar definitely hit my sweet tooth. Great texture, no funny aftertaste like some of the other chocolate Larabar flavors and I would definitely put this on the list of candy bar replacements!<br /><br />Pecan Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Not overwhelmingly sweet, great pecan pie flavor, perfect soft, slightly chewy texture.<br /><br />Lemon Bar<br />5 Stars<br />Very nice Lemon flavor and a wonderful chewy texture that reminds you of an actual Lemon Bar! The Lemon lingers in your mouth quite a while.<br /><br />Banana Bread<br />1 Star<br />This bar was bitter. There's only 3 ingredients: Almonds, Dates, and Unsweetened bananas. Well bananas are naturally sweet so what was so bitter in this bar? Some people might not find this as bad as I did, but I couldn't get past the first bite.<br /><br />Apple Pie<br />5 Stars<br />Another favorite flavor. It tastes like apple pie with a few nuts. It's just perfect.<br /><br />Ginger Snap<br />5 Stars<br />Wonderful Ginger snap cookie taste! This is probably the sweetest one I've tried. Good texture, chewy and crunchy, and delicious.<br /><br />Peanut Butter & Jelly<br />3 Stars<br />This bar had a great texture but only a so-so flavor. I would not purchase a full box of these bars, but I would pick it over some of the others if I had a limited choice.<br /><br />Key Lime Pie<br />5 Stars<br />This was a nutty bar, which is to be expected, but the subtle hint of lime was delightful. I could stand to use even more lime flavor but the soft chewy texture and lime flavor make this one of my favorites.<br /><br />UPDATE w/Additional Flavors:<br /><br />Blueberry Muffin<br />5 Stars<br />Oh, I think I've found a new favorite! This bar has a wonderfully rich blueberry flavor without being too sweet and it reminds me of a Blueberry Oatmeal Muffin.<br /><br />Chocalate Coconut Chew<br />3 Stars<br />As a huge fan of the Coconut Cream I had high hopes for this bar but after eating it the only thing I could say was "Where's the coconut?!" I definitley missed the coconut texture and flavor. The chocolate flavor of this bar however was not too sweet, not overpowering, and overall the bar will suffice for a chocolate lovers craving.

review/text: I like all of the Larabars that I have tried.  They taste good and are able to satisfy my appetite.  I do not understand why the bars can be purchased cheaper at Whole Paycheck (aka Whole Foods) for $1.35 and Walmart for $1.25 and they are more expensive per unit when purchased in a box of 16 at Amazon.  Depending on which Larabar you choose, the Amazon per unit price ranges from 1.35 for the Cherry to 1.83 for the chocolate per unit.  Amazon needs to adjust its price in order to be competitive in the market.

review/summary: Banana bread brownie?
review/text: Wow, I just had my first Larabar today after a long run, and I have been blown away.  As of late my preference has been for protein bars, but I had picked up a Larabar a few months ago just because it looked interesting.<br /><br />I tried the "banana cookie dough" flavor, since I'm a banana nut.  Unwrapping the package was difficult, though I've since found out that they have a multi-layer wrapper because there are no preservatives.  Once open, I was confronted with a raw looking rectangle of brown with pale chunks in it.  It looked moist and smelled phenomenal.  The first bite made me think "banana bread", and as I ate the rest of the bar I decided it wasn't quite like banana bread, but closer to that than a "cookie", in any case.  The pale chunks were the #1 ingredient - almonds.  The #2 and #3 ingredients were dates and bananas, respectively.  The #4 ingredient was.... nothing.  There are only 3 ingredients.  I actually flipped the wrapper over to see the continuation of the ingredients list before I realized that there was no more list!<br /><br />These bars are a little expensive for a non-protein energy bar, but the taste is like nothing you would expect from a brown rectangular smashed together food thing.  Its simply incredible, and now I have to go back and purchase the other flavors to try them out, too.

review/text: I am a health and fitness nut and I've tried about everything out there.  I love these bars as they are really filling and taste great (unless you are a sugar addict and need everything to have that super sweet calorie filling flavor!)  I also appreciate that I can buy cases of just one flavor at Amazon.com because the store where I've been buying them has 3 flavors per box and I prefer chocolate the most.  Whoever wrote the poor review about the high fat doesn't understand much about diet!  I've lost 20 pounds using these bars as a morning snack between meals combined with regular exercise and watching portion sizes.  Fat isn't the monster some think it is.. you need it and these bars provide a natural fat full of Omega 3 and Omega 6 along with a good mix of carbs and protein.  Thank you Lara Bar.

review/summary: short on ingredients, long on utter deliciousness
review/text: These are my favorite variety of Larabar.  If you like gingerbread (not gingersnaps or gingerbread cookies, mind you -- actual gingerbread, the kind that you can eat by the slice) than I am willing to bet that you will love these bars as much as I do.  The taste is exactly like that of freshly baked gingerbread; the texture is moist like gingerbread but crunchy because of the nuts the bar contains.  The crunchiness, in my opinion, doesn't detract a whit from the overall fabulousness of these bars -- in fact, I would say it adds to it.<br /><br />Finally (and this is true of all Larabars) the stunning brevity of the ingredient list bears noting.  Larabars contain no added sugar, no artificial flavoring or coloring, and no preservatives.  All of the sweetness and flavor (and there is just enough of the former and plenty of the latter) come from wholly natural, healthful sources.

review/text: I was on the lookout for granola bars that have ingredients that are more natural. I used to love Nature Valley bars, then I fell in love with the FiberOne bars, then I inhaled Balance bars. Now I think I've settled on Larabars, simply because they have such few ingredients and I can pronounce every single one of them. Even better, I can go to a regular grocery store and buy the ingredients, and if I'd want to spend more time in the kitchen, I could make them myself! (google for recipes, people really do make them themselves!)<br /><br />Love that Amazon sells them in bulk (they can get quite pricey, depending on which grocery store you go to).<br /><br />My favorite flavers are the Coconut Creme Pie, the Keylime Pie, the Carrot Cake, and the Cherry Pie. Soooo good! I don't leave the house without one or two of these in my bag :)

review/summary: Bars were moldy!
review/text: (NOTE: I purchased this box on July 8, 2012 -- not May 2012. Amazon must have used the date of a prior Larabar purchase.)<br /><br />I think Larabars are healthy; I've been eating them almost daily for years, but I like only a few flavors, and ginger snap is the best! But beware when they have a strange, sharp flavor (it tastes almost chemical to me)! This was the third box I have purchased that had this problem (out of about 8 boxes total). It always affects every bar in the box. I was able to get a refund for the first two boxes, but not this box from Amazon (I don't know why not), so I am going through the manufacturer (now General Mills), but it is not easy (I have to mail back all the wrappers I have).<br /><br />After finding mold on one of the bars, I had two of the bars tested by a food research company. I was told that the problem is the water content, the Aw, which was .717 on the moldy bar (from one lot) and .687 on the other bar (from a different lot), which tasted bad but had no visible mold (other bars in that box were later found to have mold as well). These bars still had more than 7 months before their expiration date.<br /><br />Here's a quote from the food researcher: "Pathogens cannot survive below water activity (Aw) 0.86 so food borne illness is not a risk below this Aw. Between Aw 0.60 and 0.70 the microorganisms of concern are xerophilic molds and osmophilic yeasts...In summary, the Lara Bar labeled "Bad" had an Aw high enough to support growth of mold and yeast. The other Lara Bar sample also had fairly high Aw, high enough to support growth of mold & yeast. As a standard practice, we target an Aw of less than or equal to 0.60 for all shelf stable products (with pH >4.2) in order to avoid growth of all pathogens and spoilage organisms. All manufacturers should be targeting an Aw of &#8804;0.65 unless they are adding preservatives."<br /><br />I don't know if I will give up on these bars yet, because when they do it right, they are really good!

review/text: I have been wanting to try Larabars for over a year. Finally today I picked up a box at Sam's club (the only place even remotely close to me that carries them), and I couldn't be more pleased. The bar I tried today was Apple Pie. The ingredients in the Apple Pie bar are dates, almonds, apples, walnuts, raisins and cinnamon. That's it. All natural, real food. I will say that it does not look enticing, or actually even at all appealing, and the texture leaves something to be desired...but it tastes wonderfully natural and gives a nice energy boost. It will be perfect for before/after/during workouts, but has enough calories that if I am too busy to eat a meal it will suffice. Does it taste like apple pie? Only slightly. But people who aren't accustomed to eating apple pie really won't mind, or may not even notice.

review/summary: I love larabars
review/text: I'm in college so I was looking for an healthy snack to take to class.I wasn't sure about this product when I first tried them.Now, I love them. I admit your taste buds do have to adjust to the natural flavors, especially if you are use to other bars that have a lot of artificial ingredients.  The local Kroger's had these 10 for 10 and I have tried almost all the flavors. The apple pie, cashew cookie, and lemon are my favorites.

review/text: So these bars are made of real things, and most of those things are organic!  Or all, I can't remember.  I don't like over processed food, and so this bar is perfect.  It's DELICIOUS too, of course.

review/summary: These are my favorite bars
review/text: These bars are all natural. Even diabetics can eat them. They're based on dates, but you can taste the coconut too. I eat them nearly every day. They're a little calorie dense, so you have to be careful.

review/summary: Nice snack bar alternative!
review/text: Well, if you are following the "only eat processed foods with five ingredients or less" rule, this product, Larabar's "cherry pie" fits the bill.  There are three ingredients: dates, almonds, and cherries.<br /><br />As a sports snack, it has 200 calories (70 from fat), 5g protein, and 5g fiber.  It's not a high protein bar for muscle building, but it does have the calories for glycogen replacement.<br /><br />It's not really crumbly or melty, so it transports well.  And if you are looking for a gluten-free, dairy-free, soy-free, vegan snack, this may be for you.  Most of us will snarf it down in about 4 bites.  If you need something that takes longer to eat, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Best Tasting Fruit and Nut Bar I have ever eaten
review/text: Trying to find an alternative for breakfast, I stubled upon these Larabars. After deciding on the Apple Pie flavor, I found one of the best tasting alternatives to breakfast I have ever eaten. Each bite is massive amounts of apple taste. The bars are well spread with nuts but the fruit taste is where it is at. The only downside is that the bars are kinda small so you will have to eat multiples.

review/summary: Pecan Pie - Better Hot
review/text: These are delicious, thick almonds (*with skin, which for me tend to get stuck in my teeth, so fyi) and they have a nice spice kick to them without being to much.<br /><br />I'm an athlete who is constantly looking for easy on the go snacks and fats - these cover that little two hour window for when something comes up at the last minute - be it working late or driving across town for something, etc.<br /><br />I live in Dallas TX and these arrived in the middle of the summer when it was 110 degree's outside.  I grabbed one fresh out of the box so they were hot and I later found then to be better hot and soft than at room temp. I would suggest giving that a shot. (I leave them in the car after a break at work and let them heat up that way, I have never microwaved them - I would imagine that would ruin them)

review/summary: Very yummy.
review/text: I love Larabars- I like to keep one on me in case I get super hungry when I'm out and about because the protein and fat content makes them very filling. Because I'm gluten intolerant and also do not eat highly processed foods, it can be pretty difficult to find something to eat away from home, but when I get really hungry I get ill anyway. Larabars have saved my butt more times than I can count- I like the coconut cream and peanut butter chocolate chip ones the best and they have a little less fat too!<br />Plus, only a few ingredients. Perfection!

review/text: These taste graet for a health bar.  Of course, you'll miss all the tasty high fructose corn syrup and sugar, but it's palatable enough.  The main reason I like these bars is that I don't get the allergic itch I get with some other health bars. If you have any food or nut allergies, you know what I'm referring to. So far so good!

review/text: I have been buying Larabars for some time now and I have to say, they are the best source of "good" calories, especially for someone who deals with changes in blood sugars.  The nuts provide fibre and the " good " fats, whereas the dates are a great source for energy on the go.  I love the new flavours ( Peanut butter chocolate chip and the chocolate chip brownie).  My old favourite still is the coconut chocolate chew--I am a huge fan.  They are so much better than any old chocolate bar--in fact, chocolate bars not even in the ballpark as far as a comparison!

review/text: I choose to follow a gluten-free, dairy-free diet because I have multiple sclerosis.  This product enables me to have my "sweets" without the consequences.  It's substantial & if I have two, I end up skipping a meal. (Not recommended, I know.)  The consistency is slightly moist, compact, heavy; the flavor is not overly sweet, peanut butter-y and fun (it's the only way I can describe it) when you get the chocolate chip.  If the bars had any more chips, they would overpower it.  I only wish it was a wee bit larger.  Just a wee bit because I go through three to four boxes every month.

review/text: I just discovered a new flavor of Larabar:  Carrot Cake.  I love carrot cake, and this bar is awesome.  It tastes just like carrot cake.  The yummy, scrumptious ingredients of dates, almonds, walnuts, raisins, pineapple, unsweetened coconut, carrots, cinnamon, and extra virgin olive oil all put together is heavenly.  This is one of my favorite flavors of Larabars.<br /><br />I can't sing enough praises for Larabars:  good taste, healthy, convenient.  It's good to have a few (or a lot) on hand in case you get a little hungry or weak.<br /><br />And, oh, I must mention:  These bars are created and made in Colorado.  I know, that has nothing to do with the goodness of these bars.  But Colorado is my new favorite state, so I mentioned it.  The goodness of these bars are just as wonderful as Colorado is beautiful.  And if you know how breathtaking Colorado is, then you know I am comparing these bars to something awesome.  Awesome, healthy, tasty bars that are convenient.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like these type of bars.<br /><br />Carrot cake highly recommended if you like carrot cake.
