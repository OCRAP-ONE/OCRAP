review/summary: I didn't know it had changed to packets....
review/text: The Kool Aid folks got smart. I didn't know that they had changed their packaging to small and easy to handle tubes.<br /><br />I had switched over to another brand because the Kool Aid took up to much time and handling........<br /><br />NO MORE !!  The packages are now nice flexible tubes. Great for not only making quick and easy at home---but also for traveling. getting together with friends...all you need is water and a container.<br /><br />I have always loved Kool Aid as a soft drink  and now I have even more reasons to enjoy it. Quick , easy and reasonable cost.

review/summary: Amazing Product
review/text: This is a greaat drink anytime of the year especially for those on a diet or<br />for children or grand-children.  Makes great popcycles too. The fact that it<br />comes in a cannister either in a tube or small "coffee cream type" container<br />makes it easy to store and to prepare. It comes in the usual Kool-aid flavors.

review/summary: Oh Yeah!!!!
review/text: Grape has been my favorite kool aid flavor since I was a kid, for some reason the stores around me do not carry any flavor besides tropical punch which I don't care for. I used to have to buy the unsweetened grape and mix it with splenda.<br /><br />But now, thanks to amazon prime, I get free shipping. And by subscribing to the item I get an additional 15% off, so it works out to about 25 cents per quart. I can't make it myself for that price, and this stuff tastes better than what I was making....

I'm sooo glad Kool-Aid came out with sugar free flavors especially since now I'm a diabetic. My kids love it too and we all agree that you can't even tell that it's sugar free. I keep it in the house all the time now since we all drink it.

review/summary: Hernia Inducing Cat Litter
review/text: I used Fresh Step and Scoop Away cat litters for many years and was quick to tell any of my cat owner friends that they were the best "bang for the buck" litters. They clumped hard, making the chore of cleaning the cat box a relatively easy one. Sometime around 6 months ago, that all changed. Now, they form a sludge in the cat box that is nearly impossible to scrape out. The amount of effort necessary to clean the box could easily induce a muscle strain or hernia for those unfortunate enough to purchase one of these litters. Both products are made by the Clorox Pet products Co. Consider yourself warned!

review/text: I still remember the first time I ever had Pringles. My older brother introduced them to me and I've loved them ever since. They only had the original flavor for years. And my wife has told me that these things aren't really potato chips, but that's OK, I still love them.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Great packaging, doesn't take up a lot of room.<br />2) Flavor, but that's subjective.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Fatty, they are fried and have 60% of the calories from fat. That's more than some regular potato chips and a lot despite their non greasy feel. So basically you have to limit yourself to 1 or 2oz's at a time.

review/summary: Review of Baker's Coconut Order
review/text: I purchase Baker's coconut because it is generally more fresh and moist than other brands.  It is really important to me and for my reputation that I use only the freshest ingredients when baking, especially when creating products that I will be selling. The 1st couple of times I placed an order for Baker's coconut through Amazon it met my expectations.  The last couple of times I found that some of the bags contained fresh coconut the others contained coconut that was dry and old.  In the last shipment I only had 1 bag of really fresh coconut.  I'll attempt one more order and if the same thing happens I'll have to discontinue the orders.

But I was pleasantly surprised that there wasn't much of a noticeable difference!  I'll definitely keep buying the decaf version from now on.  I've also had the Jasmine variety from this brand (not decaf) and it is also amazing.  Sadly, it doesn't come in a decaffeinated version but the flavor is well worth the small headaches I get.

review/text: I tried the Marrakesh Mint Green Tea from Mighty Leaf and really loved it. High end - lots of nice larger leaves in a pretty silk packet to dip into your water, so it's like a compromise b/t bagged tea and loose tea.<br /><br />The mint and the green tea made a great combination that did not get too bitter when accidentally steeped too long. In fact, I reused the bag a second time to make a glass of sun tea and it was lovely sipped cold as well.<br /><br />The mint is a Moroccan Peppermint, with green tea leaves from China. One can imagine being in an Indiana Jones movie, trading for tea leaves in a Marrakesh market. :)<br /><br />An artisan level tea - recommended.

review/summary: I'm not a big tea drinker, but this tea is exceptional !
review/text: I went to the Paris Baguette bakery in downtown Palo Alto the other day and got a pastry and did not want to drink a coffee drink so I ended up ordering some tea.  There were many kinds, so I just said green please, then they gave me a further list of the green teas, so I just said surprise me!<br /><br />They did, they gave me a big cup of this tea that was really smooth and fresh and very nice and warm and just the right touch of mint refreshing ... I did a double take.  I looked at the label and it was MightyLeaf tea, which I had never heard of, but more than that the tea-bag itself was made of a kind of mesh cloth that seemed to allow full circulation of the hot water through the bag.  This is the kind of beverage I could easily drink instead of soda, bottled water, juice, coffee, whatever ... so flavorful and just dried leaves in water ... imagine that? ;-) These folks are serious about their tea.<br /><br />I was very impressed, this was probably the, or one of the best "tea moments" I have ever had ... anyway, enough to look it up and buy some, and maybe try some others.  I hope I can find a sampler package.  This might me into me a tea drinker.<br /><br />It's just tea, but a real world-class product, 5/5 stars.

review/summary: Certified gluten free as of November 2010
review/text: My name is Annelies and I work for attune foods, the manufacturer of Erewhon Cocoa Crispy Brown Rice cereal. Our Erewhon certified gluten free cereals are made in a peanut-free, tree-nut free and dairy-free facility. They are run on a shared line with gluten and we abide by good manufacturing practices to help ensure against cross-contamination. This consists of the machinery being sanitized and thoroughly washed down before the cereal is made. Then after it is made, the cereal is tested to ensure it is less than 20 ppm of gluten. We sent the cereal to a separate facility last fall to double check the levels at which it tested and found it to be less than 5ppm of gluten. In November of 2010, our Erewhon gluten free cereals were certified gluten free by GIG. I hope this helps clarify our current practices as I realize there are reviews dating back many years on amazon.com and thought it would be helpful to update interested consumers of it on amazon.com.

review/summary: won't give 5 star because it's too expensive
review/text: I'm giving 4 stars to this product because the price is sooo expensive.<br />But I would say this food is good quality per my research.<br />I used to feed my dogs with "puppy chow" and later when they got older "dog chow"<br />I have parrots and I always researched for the best food for them because I was a first time parrot owner. While I was researching for my parrots food I started to think about my dogs... so I realized I may have dogs for years but I never took the time to check their food.<br />Dog Chow is a very popular brand and I always though it was at least an average quality for my dogs that also eat fresh home made food.<br />I researched and find out that good part of the food is made by corn!!!! I felt so guilty for my babies and I started to look which dog food would be more recommended.<br />I ended up finding the dogfoodadvisor web site (dogfoodadvisor.com)<br />Based on the reviews and information found on the website above I decided to buy orijen and also Instinct.<br />Problem is that my babies' tummy is used with "dog chow" and I know they can get sick with this new food even it's the best quality you can get. So I'll just start to mix a little bit with the "dog chow" until they get used with orijen and instinct.<br />If you are one person that knows how to prepare balanced and nutritious fresh home made food for dog I would say to stick on that. There is no processed food that is better than a fresh food. The trick about home made food is that you need to know how to prepare to cover all your dogs needs, if you don't know to do that you may ended up giving less nutritional food than a processed food can give to your dog.<br />Again, something I told before in a review. Please be responsible on caring and loving your animal. Remember you have friends and family, your pet has only you. You may live beyond 70 years old, you dog will have only 10 years to enjoy his life and will totally depend of you to be happy and healthy.

review/summary: Stay away!
review/text: This stuff is like crack for chocolate lovers.  But unlike really good chocolate that will fill you after one or two (or 9 or 10) pieces, it's hard to stop eating these until the bag is empty and your bank account is dry...  Don't even think of trying the dark chocolate version.  But if chocolate really isn't your thing, then you'll probably be okay having a few yummy pieces and putting it away - so go ahead and serve this to your guests.

review/summary: I've Been Looking for Some Good Tea
review/text: I really do not consider myself to be very knowledgeable with tea, accessories, brew times, and such. I often go to the nearest import store and just pick the first box that pops out. Ive tried P.G. Tips, Ty�phoo, Williamson's Lifeboat, Lyons, Adagio as well as Republic of Tea and Teavana. Each time I finished a box or a foil bag, I am always left wanting more of something a little different. I had about 1/2 a box of P.G Tips and a near full box of Lifeboat when this English No. 1 tea was delivered. After making a quick sample cup, I realized this is a tea Ive been looking for. The first pitcher disappeared within three hours.<br /><br />English No. 1 has a very smooth taste and feel. The color is a nice dark brown- a brown that best matches a mental picture of a perfect cup of tea. Without sugar, I dont find it bitter, tart, or very peppery. I make a 64oz pitcher of tea, lightly sweeten it with less that a 1/4 of a cup of German Rock Cane Sugar, and sit back and drink it all at dinner; rarely do I even have enough to consider to placing the pitcher in the refrigerator. For my 64oz pitcher, I brew 6 tea bags (although 5 do nicely) for an amount of time ranging between 5 to 10 minutes. A tea connoisseur might have their heart skip a beat at that statement, but I do like my tea strong and dark. I do not like looking at a cup of brown tinted water (in SE Houston, there is a small joke about cloudy water looking like the water in Clear Lake or Galveston Bay). Even so, the final product is not overwhelming. From a longer brewing time, the tea becomes opaque. After pouring a tall glass, I will then add more water into the pitcher to further dilute it. The bergamont flavor is still detectable and still contributes to the overall taste.<br />Even if this tea is brewed appropriately and as a single serving, this tea is still great. My next shipment is not scheduled to arrive until the 16th but I am already working on my last tin.<br /><br />The tin is small but sturdy. It does not feel cheap nor is it cumbersome to open. The lid forms a tight seal and nicely preserves the tea. The image on the tin, if I remember correctly, commemorates the opening of the Tower Bridge. Its a nice tin, to be sure, and a nice memento to keep but after your first shipment youll have three too many. I would have liked to have seen different paintings on the tins but... who cares? This is about the tea not the purty pictures on the sides of that them there tins. Something so minuscule should not detract from the quality of something so great.<br /><br />Amazon, as it is described in the product headline, says they will ship four tins in one shipment. If there are similarities, you may just as well make a pitcher of tea each day and run out way before the next subscription shipment is delivered.

review/summary: smooth, rich, easy to digest
review/text: This almond butter is nothing like the ones you usually find at the store. It is made from blanched almonds, so it has a creamier texture, sweeter flavor (no bitterness from the skins), and is easier to digest.<br /><br />I love it mixed with a bit of honey or blended with medjool dates for a rich treat or topping.<br /><br />It also makes a delicious almond milk. Just blend with water.<br /><br />Of course, I can blend my own blanched almond butter, but it is nice to have a pre-made version, too--especially since good quality blanched almonds are hard to find and quite expensive (maybe a little cheaper than the price of this jar, not sure). Blanching them on your own takes considerable time, and time is at a premium.

review/summary: Finicky cat loves it, ingredients suck
review/text: As far as my cat is concerned, he'd give this 5 stars. He's an extremely finicky eater, but he is obsessed with this food. The chunks are small enough that even though he is mostly licking the heck out of the gravy, he's still getting the solid food as well.  It seems like most other foods "in gravy" the chunks are just way too big.<br /><br />Now...as far as ingredients..."meat gravy", gross. If they don't list the specific animal the "meat" came from, it could be anything. Wheat gluten, soy flour, big allergens. Artificial color, awful. Meat by-products, yuck, but we all know that.  But hey, if it keeps my cat from being underweight, I suppose it's worth feeding him something he'll actually eat as opposed to pushing high-quality food in front of him that goes untouched.

review/text: We use this smoked chili powder in soups, in Mexican meat dishes like machaca and adobada, as well as on brisket prior to smoking. It has the extra smoky flavor that adds to the overal taste of the dish and we really like it. Since chili powder is not merely ground chiles, but a blend of other spices -- including salt -- it may not be for everyone, but we seldom need to add anything else to our recipes when using this chili powder. We also haven't been able to find smoked chili powder anywhere else. It is priced right and the shipping is reasonable.

review/summary: Older Dog? Dog with allergies? This is the best dog food peroid.
review/text: After Purina changed the formula for the dog food that my pooch was able to eat by adding in processed chicken I had to start looking for another alternative. She has allergies and she's older. The Purina food for seniors was originally lamb and rice and seemed to do her just fine. Chicken does not agree with her though.<br /><br />It was a decision of mine to go for the best since she is approached 12. I found this food at Whole Foods originally and purchased a 5 pound bag for a little over $20. There was a noticeable difference immediately with my dog. First of all she loved it. First bowl and went to town. Within 24 hours I noticed that the stools she was producing were more moist and of a better color with less smell. Then after just a few days her coat started to shine in a way that I had not seen in a while. She always has had a shine to her coat but this brought her coat back to a luster I had not seen since her youth. Makes me regret the years I spent feeding her the other food but since she never developed any health issues it did not seem to be a problem.<br /><br />Very happy I had happened upon this natural food for her. The only downside of course was trying to find this on Amazon via a direct search (maybe because of the forward slash symbol) or anywhere else on the web besides C & P's website where the 15 pound bag sells for $60, and that option of size is not available in any pet store around where I live. The way I found it which is most likely how you have found it was by doing a search for the UPC number of the food itself and finally it populated a link for this size bag on Amazon. 15 pounds is the largest size offered so far by C & P btw.<br /><br />Cost wise I do not mind spending the $46 for my dog and she is 35 pounds so this bag should last at least a month or month and half. Worth every penny to make her happy and healthy.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

review/summary: Healthy, natural and immediate, noticeable changes
review/text: I adopted an elderly dog from the pound so they sent me home with the food he had been on for 6 months (which was a very well known higher-end brand).  I noticed right away that after eating, his stomach would growl and several times he vomited. I attributed his symptoms to a new home and stress so I kept him on it for a while longer. I also noticed that even though he was a short coat dog, his white hair was everywhere. I have many dogs and this guy was the worst shedder of them all. I saw this brand and decided to give it a try. To my dismay it didn't help so on a whim I decided to try the salmon... Wow, what a difference! Not only has his stomach issue(s) resolved, his stool is a healthier consistency and color, he is shedding less and his coat has grown in thick and shiny (so different that he has cute black spots where formally bald or thin.)<br /><br />He didn't love the fruit or veggies at first and left them in his bowl but I found a way to "trick" him. I buy the salmon (grain free) canned food (in this brand) and will mix about 2 tablespoons in his food with a bit of warm water to make a nice thick "gravy". The bowl is always cleaned! To mix it up a bit I will also use their beef grain-free a few times as well. A can will last about 4 to 5 feedings if kept in the fridge.<br /><br />While he still suffers from seasonal allergies and is red where he rubs his face in the grass, this food has truly helped him blossom. I highly recommend!

review/summary: Great pistachios - better than the lower-priced alternatives. But worth the cost???
review/text: I have been buying two-pound lots of pistachios from a bulk seller on Amazon.  These are good, but have a fairly high number of "bad" nuts (maybe 1 out of 25).<br /><br />I decided to splurge on this brand.  The nuts were much better packaged (in a heavy plastic resealable envelope).  They have a little bit more "crunch" to them, and the incidence of "bad" nuts is a bit less (maybe 1 out of 40 - but I still need to visually inspect each nut I eat - those little black nuts have a strong and very disagreeable flavor).<br /><br />But I do not feel the extra cost (and higher shipping) is justified by a small improvement in quality.  I will go back to the bulk seller for my next order.

review/text: I lived in Italy from 1980 to 1985 and I used to buy this brand of there.  They had milk in cartons, tomatoes in cartons and the new swifter mops (where you remove the cloth and wash it) for sale really cheap.  They certainly had some useful and wonderful products and that was over 20 years ago.<br /><br />Now to the tomatoes.  They are rich and full bodied.  They do not have that acidy citrus taste that the canned tomatoes have.  There is no water added so they are pure tomato.  I buy the strained and the chopped and highly recommend them.  They have a long shelf life and they are a base for many of my sauces.  I find them much tastier then then canned in the grocery store.  Well worth the price.  The grocery stores used to carry them but I guess people struggled with tomatoes in a box?<br /><br />Pomi has been around a long time and you can read up on them at  [...]<br /><br />Wonderful product!

review/summary: Any Warm Blooded Kid Will LOVE it !
review/text: I bought two and gave them to a couple of boys (ages 6 and 9) and they had a riot. Really Funny ! !<br /><br />The toys themselves are sturdy and can take a child's beating. The Animal's tale serves as a delivery lever for the candy to dispense, and can be refilled after the Poo candies are gone (Any Jelly bean would work, or any candy about or smaller than a Jelly Bean.) The toy is simply a cavity with a hole to dispense candy. You could even use it as a Pill Dispenser if you had a great sense of Humor, "Time For My Pill.....Oink Oink".

review/summary: choco drizzle bars
review/text: These bars are very good tasting and I think very good for you! We got started on them because they are gluten free, and they are the best tasting gluten free product we have ever found period. My wife and I both have one mid-morning and mid-afternoon with our green tea---very good.  The only problem is that I requested that Amazon get them several months ago, then I got the notice that they had them, so I promptly ordered six boxes, only to be told they had a limit of one box!! Now its been several weeks and they still do not have any more in????  And its not because they can not get them, because every one else has them available with no limit on how many you can buy??

review/summary: Really Good Snack Bars
review/text: I can't speak for the kids, but as an adult, these rice bars make a perfect snack.  The peanuts provide protein while the rice and chocolate provide carbs.  These bars would be great for anyone with a busy lifestyle.  They're not messy, which makes them an ideal snack while working on the computer.  They're surprisingly tasty and flavorful.  The consistency is very appealing - soft yet crispy.  I buy these a lot.

review/summary: Delicious Breakfast or Snack Bars for Anyone!
review/text: I was looking for chocolate-peanut butter healthy bars to have for breakfast and found these. I was leery because the whole organic movement is not a passion of mine, nor do I have any problems with gluten. Then I got these and they are delicious. I eat one for breakfast every morning when I have to get up and running, and some nights I'll have an extra one for dessert. They work perfectly. When I babysit my godchildren they do love them as well, but as a single 30 year old workaholic these are perfect for my lifestyle and taste buds.

review/text: These are delicious.  We all love these little bars which are 4" X 1 1/2" X 1/2 "  and come individually packaged. The tastes reminds me of eating a BabyRuth Candy Bar. They are very sweet and provide a quick pick me up or anythime snack. Great for quick breakfast with glass of Soy or Almond milk.  They are covered in chocolate and have a few peanuts for extra flavor and crunch. They are a little sticky compared to regular rice krispy bars , because they use honey and brown rice syrup instead of marshmallows.<br />**gluten free but does have peanuts

review/summary: EnviroKidz's BEST Crispy Rice Bars
review/text: I like EnviroKidz' crispy rice bars, but these peanut choco ones are the best!  They have actual bits of peanut mixed in, which gives them a nice little crunch.  One caveat:  Although these bars don't taste overly sweet, they do have 8g of sugar each.  Health food they're not -- but they are a good substitute for candy bars, which tend to be much higher in fat and sugar.<br /><br />Amazon's price is the best I've found thus far, especially if you do the Subscribe & Save option.<br /><br />LATER EDIT:  Just downgraded my rating because the quality of the chocolate drizzle has really gone downhill.  They've also gotten gooier, which I personally find unappealing.

The price is great and I'm so glad you can get them on a subscription (cheaper, too!).  I would recommend keeping these somewhere cool, as they tend to melt.

review/summary: So good, even a mother can eat it
review/text: We get these snack bars so that my kids, who have gluten and casein allergies, can have something to put in their lunch. But now that we have the 6 pack, there are so many around the house, that even I was able to try them. And unlike some gluten-free foods, these are really palatable. Especially good with a slathering of peanut butter on top, if your child isn't allergic to nut products, that is. We took a load with us on vacation to Wisconsin Dells, and they proved a delicious, energy-filled breakfast before we hit the waterparks. And on days when my daughter is late getting ready for school, she can just grab a bar for breakfast as I drive her in the car. In short - quick, convenient, delicious, and gluten-casein free. Perfect for a family with allergies.

review/summary: Great for kids on a Gluten free diet
review/text: The vast majority of granola bars on the market are unsuitable for Gluten free diets since they either contain wheat or are made on machinery that process wheat. The ones that are gluten free are very often just a bunch of nuts stuck together with honey.<br /><br />What I like best about these bars is that they are made with organic puffed brown rice and peanuts. The nutritional values are decent without sacrificing taste. Not all granola bars with peanuts go over well with my kids. If the peanut flavor is too strong then they reject the stuff instantly. These bars they absolutely love! The chocolate is not too strong either so it makes for a nice blend of flavors.<br /><br />These are a real life saver for us as a quick portable gluten free snack

review/summary: So delicious think rice treat meets reeses...but slightly nutritious!
review/text: Ok, so these are marketed towards kids, lunchboxes etc, but as an adult I say "Hey why not!", I can enjoy peanut buttery, chocolate drizzled rice treats in a colorful animal decorated box too, right! So I went for it, and sooooo glad I did. These are delicious and nutritious! I would say these completely satisfy a sweet tooth, and could totally replace a candy bar craving. They fall somewhere between a rice treat and (for anyone who's ever had one, a whatchamacalit bar) essentially, if you like both of those, I'd say you'd definitely do well with these treats. Things of note, there are 120 calories so this is a better choice calorically, and at just 8 sugars it shouldn't spike anyones levels. It only has 1 gram of fiber and 2 grams of protein, but considering it practically tastes like a candy bar it's not so bad. I will say, this item does have brown rice syrup in it and a lot of people are steering clear of that due to the arsenic warnings, but I'd say in moderation it should be reasonably fine. Also, these have soy in them as well for anyone with allergies. Okay, so looking for a yummy pb choco treat I'd recommend these for sure!

review/summary: Convenience Snack for Kiddos
review/text: Organic portable option for kiddos.  Beware if you give it to a toddler though, it does have peanut pieces that are large enough to pose a chocking hazard, so don't leave them alone.  Also you need to keep in mind that the choco drizzle is going to melt if held in a hand long enough.  It's a little bit of sweet, a little bit of salty, and a little bit of crunchy.  Good size as far as bars go, in individual wrappers.

review/text: Kids love snacks. But sometimes their snack choices can be unhealthy. But Envirokidz bars are a great healthy, organic, gluten free snack for kids and adults. I buy these by the caseload for both of my kids. This is my youngest son's favorite variety of all these bars, and we'll keep buying these for a long time.<br /><br />I will say that my oldest son doesn't like peanuts, but he does like peanut butter (weird, I know). Anyway, this variety does have actual peanuts in them. So if you have a picky kid like me, choose one of the other flavors. They're all great.

review/text: Don't get me wrong - all the Envirokidz bars are pretty good - but these are amazing.  I don't personally eat all that many of them since I primarily buy these for my son who can't have gluten - although my other children love these as well.  (They're so good though that sometimes I can't help but have one.)<br /><br />They taste a little bit like a candy bar.  They aren't bland, sickeningly sweet, don't have any odd aftertaste, etc.  The sugar content isn't through the roof.  I love that they're organic and have ingredients that I can pronounce.  They're expensive, but aren't as bad as many other gluten free bars.  They're really nice to take along in the car while running errands.  If my son's best friend in school didn't have peanut allergies, I'd send these along in his school lunch.
