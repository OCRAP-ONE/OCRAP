review/summary: Really unhappy
review/text: I had expected more but I chalk it up to my not paying attention to the description,  This was not as stated.  My box didn't have any nuts and the taste was something to be desired.  I purchased some from a different company and they were excellent.  I definitely won't be purchasing these again.

review/summary: Nostalgia aside- this is a great cereal
review/text: I've tried all of my local supermarkets, Target and Wal-Mart.  The only place I could find this cereal is Amazon. Go Amazon!! I've been looking for this cereal for a while now.  I used to love it as a kid and I was pleased to find out that I still do.  The only negatives are that there aren't as many big chunks as there were in the past and the little bits tend to get soggy very quickly.  This cereal is really sweet so be careful because you can easily get tired of them quickly.  I love em though.  Perfectly sweet and crunchy.

review/summary: One of the Best and Delicious
review/text: I remembered this cereal from my childhood and had to buy it.  It is still delicious.  The first half of the cereal is made of larger clumps of krispies with the second half of more broken up, smaller pieces.  I thought this was a result of shipping, but after buying this in a store, it is simply how it is made.<br /><br />The cereal is closer to the expiration date than most stores, but one person can easily eat it all before it even comes close to being questionable.  I've never had the problem of freshness.<br /><br />This is a high quality cereal and one I truly miss.  I will be buying this again and again.

review/summary: Really good cereal, one of my favorites!
review/text: I don't generally eat "kid" cereals such as Froot Loops, Cocoa Puffs, etc but if you like Rice Krispies Treats you might just love this cereal. It's not sticky and chewy like a Rice Krispies treat, but more crispy. Once milk is poured over it softens a bit while still maintaining the shape and flavor of a broken up Rice Krispies treat. It's not too sweet, it seems to have just the right amount of sweetness to make it delicous. My kids also enjoy this cereal. The only drawback is that when I order this they eat it up so quickly. If I had only ordered Raisin Bran I would still have it.

It turns out it's here on amazon as well as only in walmart super stores, which sucks because I hate walmart with a passion and won't go there unless it's something I can't get anywhere else or it's late and I need it.<br /><br />However the problem here is that this products description says it's a pack of 4 but I only got 1 box and it says that it's package 1 of 1 and completes my order.<br /><br />When I seen the normal sized box it came in, I thought "well I'm the noob for not reading. It was probably 4 travel boxes" but it wasn't when I opened it and it was just 1 normal box, bot 4 as described.<br /><br />5 for the cereal, 1 for this service.

review/summary: Rice Krispies Treats Cereal. Best Thing. EVER
review/text: First off i was a bit weary due to other reviews sayin the cereal was expiring soon. My cereal came packed very well, 4 boxes of beautiful rice krispies treats cereal which didnt expire for about 8 months. opening the first box was epic...those first big chunks were huge! and despite shipping the cereal was in great condition. Now, as someone who eats cereal once maybe twice a week, i tell you this. all 4 boxes were gone in a week. This cereal is simply AMAZING. childhood memory lane. i ordered frankenberry and booberry afterwards too, but this cereal is 10x better then both. Fortunately, i found a specialty store which carries this cereal :) but had i not, i would be spending alot more money on amazon.

review/text: I debated about buying this for months, but I'm so glad I did! All four boxes will not expire for over six months, and they'll be eaten well before then.  It worked out to be $9.00+ per box including shipping, but value is what you're willing to pay for something. Since it's just as I remember, I couldn't be happier!  Some other reviews said this cereal was discontinued, but that is not true.  Kellogg's website has it listed and you can put in your zip code to find it locally.  Unfortunately there aren't any nearby me, so thank you, Amazon!!

It's good stuff, just as you'll remember it from your childhood back in the 90's.<br /><br />I'm currently purchasing this for my girlfriend for the upcoming V-day. She used to love this stuff, and will more than likely be pleased to see there are still ways to obtain it. =]<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for offering up an out of circulation cereal product from my childhood!

I don't think it's a shipping problem because I have ordered cereal from amazon before and never had this problem. I think it's the design of this cereal that makes it crumble easily. if you like eating mush you might enjoy eating this.

review/text: I remember this cereal from when I was a kid, but I couldn't seem to find it anywhere. So I signed up to be notified when it became available from Amazon, lo and behold less than a week later I got an email telling me that it had become available. I was very pleased, until I saw the price tag. When a box of cereal costs over $46 (including s&h) it becomes less a novelty from your childhood and more a luxury item. I'm in college right now, I have just enough money for only a few luxury items; $45 is not a luxury I can afford. Five stars for the cereal, but I hope no one is foolish enough to buy it at this price.

review/text: I really love the taste of this cereal. I went through all three of my boxes really fast. It tastes just like the treats. The only problem is the cereal gets soggy a lot faster than most cereals. It still tastes good once soggy, but not nearly as good when it's nice a crunchy. Must. Eat. Fast.

review/summary: Good, but not chewy
review/text: I was hoping this cereal would be chewy like the Rice Krispies treats you find at bake sales and fundraisers. Alas, it is crunchy like the traditional Rice Krispies cereal.<br /><br />Otherwise, the flavour is accurate. It's pretty good, quite sweet, but I wouldn't buy it again.

review/text: This cereal is great.  Most people have no idea it even exists, and think you are talking about the baked rice krispies with marshmallows.  NOPE.  The purple box!<br /><br />If you can't find them in your grocery store, check WALMART.  Almost every WALMART I have ever been to stocks this cereal.

review/summary: Amazing cereal
review/text: This cereal is just amazing. It's a shame it's not sold in more stores (you cannot find it anywhere where I live). So glad that Amazon carries it. Upon arrival, it was surprisingly fresh and the boxes were in perfect shape. Highly recommend this cereal for those just looking the recapture feelings of their childhood, or just to simply have a cereal that is superior to most of those out there these days.

review/text: It was a long shot checking to see if Amazon carried this, but they did! I read some of the reviews and saw that most people were complaining about the expiration date. I ordered some, received it within 4 days, and upon checking the exp. date, found that I still have more than a year to eat it! This cereal is so good I don't think it could even last in my house that long. Either way, if you're a fan of this cereal, buy it! You won't regret it. I'm getting more right now!

I was pretty excited to try it after reading reviews from others and I've gotta say it is a pretty darn good cereal. It tastes just like the rice krispies treats, but "snaps, crackles, and pops" just like the regular rice krispies cereal.

review/text: I had remembered eating this cereal years ago, so I scoured my local stores only to discover it was not available in my area. imagine my joy when I found it on Amazon! This cereal puts almost every cereal (aside from the Blueberry muffin top cereal of course) to shame! If you have not had this you are missing out! It's sweet but not too sweet, and even gives the milk a marshmallowy taste.The 3 pack sure did not last long, as my girlfriend had never had it after the first bite she was hooked too!

review/text: This cereal is great with or without milk and it is easy to finish a box quickly. Amazon ships the cereal quickly and the cereal is always fresh and months away from the expiration date.<br />While I love this cereal the recent decision to reduce the number of boxes to 3 without adjusting the price appropriately does not differentiate this package from buying boxes in the local grocery. I wish Amazon would reconsider selling this as a pack of 4.

review/text: I have been looking in stores for this cereal for quite some time now.I used to love this cereal when I was younger but for some reason they stopped selling it in stores awhile ago. I finally looked online and found it! I got 4 boxes in my order and with shipping and handeling it's only a little bit more that a regular box at the grocery store. I was concerned  that when I got it maybe they would be old or something but I was pleasantly surprised, every bite of the cereal sent memories of my childhood streaming through my mind. Tasty, snap crackly poppin goodness! Well deserved 5 stars, wish they still sold in stores!

They are great small crunch clusters, with just enough sweetness to make them a great snack or a great cereal (but we snack on them for sure!) Personally I think they're better dry, but to each his own ;)<br /><br />And for the record, they arrived with a current (in the future) expiration date.<br /><br />We'll definitely keep buying these as long as Amazon keeps selling them. I'm really shocked they don't stock them at any grocery stores near us!

review/text: So I was pleased to see that the cereal arrived before it's intended ship date, however when I poured my first bowl this morning and went for my first bite, I was pretty upset. I let it soak in the milk for a few minutes and then went to grab a big clump for my first bite, when I went to bite into it, it was rock-solid. I mean a hammer couldn't break through this stuff. It turns out all the clumps are the exact same way, and that's my favorite part of the cereal. So I'm still eating it and just not eating the clumps because it still tastes good, I was just ultimately let down by this.

review/summary: Glad to have my TREATS again...
review/text: I have fond memories of Rice Krispies Treats cereal from my younger days and was glad to see it available on Amazon (since I haven't seen it in stores around me for years). It doesn't seem that they've changed much with it, because the taste is just what I recall (basically tastes like Rice Krispies treats without that marshmallow chewiness). It's definitely sweet cereal, but not overpoweringly so, and is perfect for breakfast or snacking (especially the big chunks). I was a little worried that the expiration date would be close, but I've got more than a few months to go, so that's good. If you're a fan of the cereal already, or Rice Krispies treats in general, you should pick this up. It's hard to find anywhere else and Amazon's price just about makes it a no-brainer.

review/summary: A great and hard to find cereal
review/text: "Rice Krispies Treat" Cereal is impossible to find nowadays.  I have looked at nearly 10 different locations for this product, only to be disappointed.  Needless to say, I was very excited that I found this cereal online at Amazon, and at such a great price.<br /><br />The Rice Krispies Treat Cereal is basically a sweeter version of the "Rice Krispies" Cereal.  The rice pieces are however more clumped together like "Rice Krispies Treats" bars would be.  This version does have more sugar than "Rice Krispies Cereal", but actually is less in calories (go figure.)  When I had this cereal as a kid, the cereal was more clumped together, but now the clumps are far fewer and smaller.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as it is easier to eat.<br /><br />Anyways, I rate this cereal very highly for kids especially.  You will find that it still have a lot of vitamins in it.  Being 23 years old, I still cannot get enough of this tasty cereal.

review/text: Most sugary kids' cereal tastes simply awful and chemical. But this one tastes so good! It's actually a bit sweeter than the RIce Krispie bars you would make for yourself, but it's a good kind of sweetness. The cereal comes in various-sized chunks but are uniform enough to eat. I don't eat this often, but I must admit, this is one of my all-time favorite cereals. It is freaking DELICIOUS.

The cereal arrived in good condition and was fresh, it expires in Oct 2011 and I bought it in Jan 2011. But with the way this stuff tastes, it will be gone long before then. It tastes just like rice krispie treats, although its not as sticky as homemade ones.

review/summary: AWESOME! #2 Favorite Cereal - can now enjoy again!
review/text: This cereal is awesome, especially if you mix in with Cocoa Krispies.  4 boxes for about $10 with free shipping - how can you pass that up?!?!  I'll continue to buy this every 2-3 months, and you can even save more with a subscription!  Thanks Amazon!

review/text: WhenI first heard that I could buy this cereal online I was a little wary. I wasn't sure if I could trust that the cereal would be fresh or expired. I have been looking for this cereal for a long time because the stores in my area stopped selling it years ago due to the high sugar content. When I saw that I could get 4 boxes for 12 bucks, I had to order them. The shipment was received 2 days after, so I would say it was delivered quickly. I'd recommend this seller to everyone who loves this cereal.. Enjoy!

review/summary: Amazon, you rule!
review/text: Everything went well with my order. I just received my order today of 4 boxes of Rice Krispies Treats cereal. I was so happy! They won't expire for 8 months. I couldn't wait to enjoy a big bowl of this crispy, munchy, tasty cereal. This cereal is so good and yummy, but really hard to find, unless you go to a Walmart supercenter, or by getting it on Amazon.com. I will order more in the future. If you're a cereal lover like me, then you must try this cereal, you will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Oh sweet nostalgia!
review/text: Thank you Amazon! I just received my package of 4 boxes of Rice Krispie Treats Cereal and it made my day!<br /><br />I was so excited to open it and smell my childhood inside. I had two bowls. The second time around I remembered the perfect milk-to-cereal ration for this particular cereal. I can't even express the snap crackle pleasure of a spoonful of this delicious treat. (Just a little milk goes a long way!)<br /><br />Also very satisfied with the freshness and pleased find out that they don't expire until May 2011! Woohoo!<br /><br />Definitely a recommended buy for the cereal lovers out there!

review/summary: Rice Krispies Treats Cereal...Just as I remembered!
review/text: I was happy to receive the package promptly and it arrived in good condition, no smashed cereal boxes or anything.<br />I was also VERY pleased to see that they had not yet expired! (They didn't expire until January 2011). We just finished up the final box...so delicious! Just I had remembered! It's definitely one of my favorite cereals, I'm sad they don't produce it anymore.<br />I'm still not sure how this company has some of this cereal still since they've stopped making it...just overstock from when they did make it I guess?<br />Either way, mine was great and I'm already out and it was really tasty. So I may consider ordering more!<br />:)

review/summary: Great cereal
review/text: I got this on Amazon because I loved it when it first came out and they don't sell it much anymore at least not in the Northeast USA.  This comes in a 4-pack and if you remember the size of the cereal it isn't as big as lucky charms and those boxes, it's slimmer.  Still not a bad deal for the price because the cereal is awesome.  Kinda gets old after the 3rd box, but still a great cereal.  Expires at the end of 2010 which is good because other reviewers said their's came stale.  They should send you boxes with at least a year or close to it left on them.  Great cereal though.

review/text: Soo happy with my rice krispie treats cereal! It came in the mail SO quickly which I was impressed with since I live in Alaska and it was the first to arrive out of all of the items I ordered that day! NOT expired like some of the other reviews say. I got my 4 boxes which all didn't expire until June 2010! And believe me, they'll be gone long before that day! Pretty pricey but well worth it in my opinion. =)

review/text: This is my favorite cereal.  I used to eat it when I was younger but was unable to find it until about a year ago on Amazon.  I have ordered the 4-pack a couple times now and have not received any that were close to being expired.  These are by far the best Rice Krispies and maybe even one of the best cereals.  I have been able to find it at the Super Walmart stores but the price per box is cheaper with a 6-month subscription.

review/text: I've been on the hunt for this cereal for the last 5 years to no avail. The kellogs rice krispies website didn't even acknowledge its own product. Until finally one day I saw it on amazon, and it was like a miracle. I started to read all of the reviews and got a little concerned when I saw complaints about it being expired. But I had to try it out for myself, this was my last chance to eat this cereal. Im eating a bowl of this cereal from heaven right now and I couldn't be happier. It tastes exactly like I remember and they don't expire until jan.2010!! They'll be gone long before then, but thanks to amazon I can have them whenever I want!

review/text: So I had given up at the stores here in CA. I went online and found amazon had em. I read these reviews and saw that people said boxes were expiring. I got mine today and they dont expire til 1/2010! I did some reading around and it looks like this stuff only goes to select walmart superstores and most east coast chains. It's a shame too, it really is one of the best cereals of the 20th century. Long live rice krispies treats cereal!!!

review/text: I thought I would be getting more crackers than what was included in this box.  There was a total of 18 individual packs.  I'm from Hawaii and this would have cost less than 10 bucks yet this was sold for more than twice that amount.  I know there is an added cost to ship, but you still can't justify this price.  I'm very disappointed so I will buy directly from the Diamond website in the future.

review/summary: break easily- would NOT recommend
review/text: I really like all the other Green Sprouts products, but these are a no-go. Both the spoon and fork were broken easily by my 9 month-old baby. The spoon he easily snapped in half and the fork was shattered by him pounding it on the high chair tray. Luckily I was right there because the utensils broken and shattered into small pieces that were very sharp. I think they could be very dangerous if he swallowed a shard or put the broken end in his mouth. I would not recommend these at all. Instead try the Green Sprouts silicone toddler spoon. It is soft and flexible and has not yet broken for me.
