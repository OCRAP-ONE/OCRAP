review/summary: My cats won't eat anything else!
review/text: I try to feed my 2 cats organic foods, with no by-products in it. This food fits my requirements. Plus both of my cats LOVE this food. They even refuse to eat moist foods of any kind now. Their coats are shiny, they are lean and energetic!! Neither one overeats this food. My older cat was always plump when fed the famous name brand foods. Her coat was dull and brittle. Now it's shiny and soft. I love this food too, because I could feed it to the youngest when she was a kitten and not have to look for another 'adult' cat food when she turned a year. I love that I can order it online from Amazon.com. I find it less expensive on Amazon.com and I don't have to hunt for it in various stores. It's delivered to my doorstep. I highly recommend this food to all cat lovers! Just leave some for my cats!!:)

review/text: My cats were never very enthusiastic about dry foods - "premium" or otherwise - until they tried this stuff.  Now they get quite huffy if I try to give them any other brand.  It felt a bit pricey at first, but none of it goes to waste, even though it's been part of their diet for several months now.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: Seems True to its title
review/text: After looking over the ingredient list on the website, which lists meat as primary ingredient, and also saw their comparisons to other brands by ingredient, this product seems to be a solid competitor among top premium cat food brands. Now for the next question -- does your cat like it! Mine did, and she absolutely refuses to eat cheap foods, digging them out of her bowl and batting them around the kitchen floor to let me know what she thinks about them if i try to feed them to her. The manufacturer has used one of the same processing plants that Blue Buffalo and Natural Balance used in the past.

review/summary: Subscribe and Save a great value on a great cat food
review/text: I'm writing this review to add another strong voice in support of the quality and value of the Harmony dry cat food. Like the other reviewers, I had searched long and far for a food that fit my tough guidelines for healthy ingredients.  I found the indoor formula Harmony cat food at my local supermarket, was impressed after reading the ingredients list and decided to try it on my six cats ranging in age from 1 to 15 years old.  Each cat, without exception, took to the food right away.  When I found the chicken and rice formula at Wegman's (40 miles away), I switched my cats to that because I was concerned that the indoor formula for outdoor cats might not be the right balance of nutrients since Harmony went to the trouble of developing two varieties.  Once again, my cats took to the food right away.  I feed them dry and wet food and decided to try the Harmony canned.  In the past, I needed to mix some of the food I was trying to replace with the new food--but that was not necessary with the Harmony food.  I've been a cat caregiver for most of my 59 years.  I have never found a cat food that was so well received by my feline friends as Harmony.  In fairness to the single one star reviewer in this group, I looked up the Royal Canin brand.  I was not positively impressed by the ingredients list.  Besides that, Royal Canin has at least 3 varieties of dry food--a protein, a smell enhanced, and a texture variety. Huh?  I just wonder if all of the 1 star reviewer's 60 felines can agree on the same variety! On the point of the value of purchasing this food through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it is by far the best pricing I've found.  Wegman's--again 40 miles away!--sells it for $12.99 with a Wegman's card--$14.99 without.  Through this program, currently I can get the food delivered to my doorstep for $12.66--no more long drives to Wegman's and less expensive to boot!

review/summary: Good Quality Food Not Too Expensive
review/text: I decided to return to a natural food for my male cat. He has the tendency to overeat and I battle to keep him at a healthy weight. This food has MEAT as the first ingredient; this is rare to find. It is also available at my local grocery store. Not only does he love it, my little adult female does too. She sneaks over and steals from the male's bowl when he has left some food. For medical purposes she is on kitten food, so I do not feed her the same food. I was hoping that with no fillers, my cat would fell more satisfied. I mix up fiber powder and water with the male's cat food and he is more satisfied and usually does not beg for more food.  I just wish the company made a larger bag than 6.5.

review/summary: Gluten Free and Delicious (or so my cats tell me...)
review/text: We've tried a variety of different cat foods over the past year or so and this was our ultimate winner.  One of our cats has some GI issues and while we never got a straight diagnosis, they appear to be related to gluten consumption.  We had them on prescription cat food but given that there are 4 of them (and only 1 with the issue) this was getting expensive.  We gave this a try and while the GI issues didn't 100% go away, they became significantly better (as much so or more so than when on the prescription food).  Perhaps most importantly, it was generally healthy for all the cats and they all loved it.

review/text: I used to feed my cats a mixed diet of wet and dry friskies and one of them also used to have a problem with throwing up/hairballs.  She would routinely throw up every other day.<br /><br />Ever since switching them both to this cat food, my feline compadres have had no issues at all.  The one with the throwing up problem hasn't had an episode in weeks now and the other eats less and seems far more happy over all.<br /><br />It's a bit pricey but for the peace of mind and healthy state of living it's given my cats, I can't complain.

review/summary: Love this cat food!
review/text: My older cat was begining to have stomach problems.  It came on suddenly and I felt that it was due to a change of ingredients put in her dry cat food.  I began to look for a higher grade of food and read multi reviews on products.  I felt that Harmony Farms had the most consistent positive reviews.  Also owners with cats who were having digestive issues seem to have a higher percentage of improvement when changed to Harmony Farms. She had dramatic improvement almost immediately.  She still is having ocasional issues but she had developed severe inflammatory problems.  Take great caution in considering what you feed your pets.  I changed my dog as well!!  It was a good decision and I am very pleased with Harmony Farms and Amazons shipping it to my home.

review/summary: Both cat and owner are very pleased!
review/text: First, it arrived exactly in two days thanks to the prime shipping! So that's already a star there.<br /><br />Anyway, I adopted a cat recently who was a bit on the heavier side and a little bit older (3 years old). I wanted to give him the best food possible and wanted to make sure he would be happy and healthy. Also, the food that I was feeding him was the atrocious Walmart "Special Kitty" brand so anything was better than that.<br /><br />I didn't even need to transition my cat at all. The second I opened the package to feed him his first bowl he was all over me! Would NOT leave me alone until there was kibbles to be eaten in his bowl. Now whenever he hears me putting food in his bowl he comes running. He loves the stuff.<br /><br />He already seems more active and alert after just a couple days of eating this awesome food. The price wasn't too shabby either compared to other natural/holistic cat food brands.

review/text: I purchased this pack of 12 tins of Tropical Fruits mints at the same time as ordering another set that was a smaller variety pack of 6 different tins. ( see my other review )This package of 12 tins are all one flavor, but they are perfect for almost anyone who loves fruits, especially pineapple and other tropicals. The package could be broken up and used as stocking stuffers, since they are each individually sealed in plastic,  or as a lovely small gift for bridesmaids at weddings, after you have taken a couple of tins out for yourself, of course, as you will never be able to part with all of them! Very pleased with these and feel that anyone who loves small and attractive things for their purse or laptop bag, rather unique looking and classy finds, will likewise love this item.

review/summary: Great taste, good price
review/text: I like a Starbucks latte as much as the next guy, and who doesn't like a sweet iced mocha with whipped cream?<br /><br />But I have a policy against drinking calories. One Starbucks drink can rival the number of calories in a Big Mac, and can have more than 2x the carbs! I also avoid sugar and caffeine, so this really limits my coffee choices. And on this subject, let me give you my personal guarantee - on decaf flavored coffees like this one, there is no taste difference between decaf and caffeinated. I can absolutely guarantee in a blind taste test you couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />So I sometimes prefer flavored coffee beans (as opposed to adding flavors to my drink). Decaf options are not always plentiful, so I love finding new flavors in decaf. This one (Paramount Butter Rum Creme) tastes like Christmas!<br /><br />When the package arrive, it smelled like burnt plastic. I almost returned it without opening it. But when I opened the bag, it smelled wonderful (not exactly Butter Rum - more like white chocolate). And it definitely tastes as good as it smells.<br /><br />Additionally, the price point is about right. I typically pay $6.49 to $6.99 locally for a 12-ounce bag of flavored decaf coffee, or $8.99 to $10.99 per pound for bulk coffee (at the grind-it-yourself kiosk). But decaf flavor choices at the local markets are limited, and if I pay local sales tax, there is less than a dollar difference than ordering this specialty flavor (I paid $16.92 for 2 bags. I got free shipping, & I also noticed there is a discount for subscription-based ordering).<br /><br />My only complaint would be, if you're making normal drip coffee, this might be too strong. You might try tempering it with 1 or 2 scoops of non-flavored coffee. At home, I typically make espresso, or cold brewed toddy. In both cases, I can use about 20% less of this product, and the flavor still comes out great. And, if I'm using 20% less, there is additional cost savings as well.<br /><br />Also, be aware the Paramount brand seems to grind their beans finer than normal drip coffee. This is how I like it - it's great for espresso, and ok for drip coffee - but not ideal for toddy or french press, and if you percolate it won't work at all.<br /><br />So here's my favorite coffee recipe for decaf:<br /><br />-Use the flavored beans to make 8 ounces of coffee (or 4 shots of espresso)<br />-Pour over ice in a large glass (it's ok to pour the hot drink over ice)<br />-Add 1 shot of half & half (I prefer heavy cream) - the result should be a caramel color<br />-Optional: If you prefer a frappe, pour the contents in a blender (I usually prefer it over ice, not blended)<br />-Add a sprinkle of cinnamon & nutmeg on top<br />-The result is a complex, sweet, robust treat that is sugar free, near-zero calorie, and non-caffeinated<br />-The taste rivals any store-bought latte, and puts Starbucks to shame (and costs pennies to make - not $4.00!)

The cake is almost as good as if you baked it in the oven only much quicker and easier. All you have to do is add water to the mix, stir together, squeeze the carmel from the packet onto the cake and put it in the microwave for approx. 1 min. and 15 seconds and you have a decent cake without the trouble, time and mess of making a full size cake mix.<br /><br />Try it, you'll be glad you did.

Yes, the peppermint is strong at first and fades within two minutes, but it doesn't completely go away and the gum stays pliable and chewable.  The pieces are larger (75%-100%) than Spry's and you can blow bubbles with them!  There is no titanium dioxide  or glycerine in them (like Spry) and I feel this a better choice for our family.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this gum for oral health and enjoyment.  Nice to have a gum that isn't loaded with chemicals that I can give my children.

review/summary: Tastes disgusting and the peppermint flavor is extremely short lived
review/text: I really, really do not like this gum. It might be gluten free and "natural", but it tastes disgusting. The peppermint flavor only seems to be in the outer candy shell of the gum. So you chew and break the shell, then swallow that part and then the taste is gone. The taste only lasts about the time it takes to chew up a Tic Tac and swallow it and doesn't leave the pleasant aftertaste a Tic Tac does. Then after that candy shell is gone, to me at least, it tastes like chewing on a wood chip and is almost as hard. I can't stand chewing it even as long as minute. I think I might get more out of chewing on ice. Sorry, I really tried to like this, but I'm taking a pass on this brand of gum.

review/text: These are okay for a mass produced product frim a factory.  Nothing spectacular.<br /><br />Ordered direct from the company's web site. Faced w/ 3 confusing choices: ship & deliver ASAP, ship whenever, deliver in time for Christmas. I chose the first thinking it was the fastest. My items were not delivered until 12/27. When I contacted Swiss Colony, they said, "Too bad."<br /><br />Next time I'll get real petit fours shipped from an actual bakery.

review/summary: Great Cakes!
review/text: These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that.

review/summary: ABSOLUTE MENTAL ORGASM
review/text: Ok, I know some of you may not like the choice of my words, 'mental orgasm'- but, once you try this cheese, you will agree.<br />I first tried some at a local cider mill last month and knew it was love at first bite. Once I got home, I called local stores in the area that carried a nice selection of cheeses. I can't keep enough on hand, it's that good...Just get yourself some crackers and you're set! I also grated some over pasta with olive oil, and grated some over tomato's then put it under the broiler. It has a nice dry consistency and the merlot is not overpowering. I highly recommend this award winning cheese!

It, by a long shot, replaced Brie as my favorite cheese.

review/summary: Too much salt, not enough mojo
review/text: Late July makes excellent products, and their Mild Green Mojo chips have plenty to crow about: they're whole-grain, the cheese doesn't use animal rennet, and part of the proceeds funds summer camps for kids.  The chips themselves are hearty and satisfying, like all Late July products I've tried  -  they don't incite that gobble-gobble-gobble never-full reaction that cheap junk food does.<br /><br />The problem is that, for all their fancy billing, the chips honestly don't have much flavor: they're labeled as "green chiles with cheese & a hint of lime," but I don't really taste cheese or lime, and I taste the chilies only through a bit of heat.  The predominant flavor I get, besides the (admittedly good) whole-grain base, is salt  -  lots of it.  Even if every other flavor listed were full and vibrant, the sodium in these chips would be an overwhelming deal-killer.<br /><br />If you do decide to pick these up, don't worry about the smaller bag size  -  as explained above, you really do feel satisfied with a smaller portion size.  They're an example of a good company off their game, though, so my best counsel here is simply to pick another flavor in the brand.<br /><br />HEY, KIDS!: For summertime fun, count how many times the word "organic" appears in the list of ingredients.

If you're looking for a healthy, light whole wheat flour, a nutritionist recommended KING ARTHUR'S WHITE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR. It has the nutrition of whole wheat with the consistency of white flour--so it's not too heavy and gritty. I make gravies, soups, muffins, pancakes, cookies etc.--everything with it. I'll never buy white non-nutritious flour again! It's a great way to sneak whole grains into desserts. I never feel guilty cooking with this as I know it's healthy for my family and provides necessary whole grains. It has the whole grain yellow stamp on it, which my son says means it's good for you. I love cooking with this flour and use it all the time.

review/text: I love flavored tea, especially tea mixed with fruit flavors. The mixes that I like in this particular Lipton Pyramid Teabag series, include Bavarian Wild Berries, White with Blue Pomergranate, and Island Favor with Peach and Mango. I bought the Harvest Strawberry & Passion Fruit yesterday, and tried one cup today. I must say that this particular mix has to be the weakest one in this series, because the basic red tea is weak, and you don't taste the Strawberry nor the Passion Fruit favor. The two ingredients that stand out, believe it or not, are the hisbicus flowers and lemon grass.

review/text: the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag.

review/text: I make my own ice tea every day--brew it using my coffee maker. My favorite combination is one Lipton Ice Tea Family Size Bag, with two of the Lipton Flavored tea bags. The Harvest Strawberry and Passion Fruit tea is by far the best. Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores (and I live in Los Angeles!) I have no problem with caffeine, so the fact that the tea contains caffeine is a plus for me. At the same time, compared to the other flavored red and white teas Lipton makes, this particular blend has the least caffeine--only 13 grams per serving which is extremely low. I even occasionally brew it mixed with a decaf Ice Tea Family Size bag and drink it in the evening. It has a slightly more than subtle strawberry flavor that gives my ice tea a refreshing perk. I highly recommend this tea!

review/summary: The tea is good, but.......
review/text: ......you don't get the stated amount.<br />In each box I have from the pack of 6, there wasn't 20 bags in any of them, best case 19, sometimes 18.<br />Also, in each box, there was at least 1 bag that wasn't properly sealed, and leaked it's contents all over, thereby reducing the effective count 1 or 2 per box.<br />You get roughly 16-18 good bags per box.<br />The secret for good iced tea from these bags is to fill a clean quart mason jar with water from a filtered pitcher like the brita pitcher, put the full mason jar (No lid, duh.) in the microwave until it boils, then drop in 2 or 3 bags. Leave it in the microwave, so nobody gets burned. Once the water cools enough for you to be able to touch the jar, screw on the top, and leave it on the counter, upside down. Leave the bags and all in the jar.<br />Once it's room temp, put it directly in the fridge. Leave the bags in the jar.<br />Put a thick glass tumbler in the freezer.<br />Leave it overnight.<br />When you're thirsty the next day, get the thick tumbler out of the freezer, fill it with ice, and fill it with the tea from the jar. Now take the bags out and throw them away.<br />Ahhhh....<br />This is good tea, but it needs to be steeped overnight for best taste, and you don't get 20 bags in the box. Don't say I didn't warn you.

review/text: Don't buy these!!!  They're awful.  I bought these teas for my bridal shower.  We were going to serve tea.  When I got them they were not fresh at all.  Even after you brewed them there was no flavor or aroma.  I couldn't send them back because of the return policies, etc.  I had opened a box to see how they were.  I think there would've been a restocking fee too.<br /><br />You're better off getting these from the store.

review/text: I got this tea because it was about to expire and Amazon had it for a great price. The tea has a somewhat bitter taste but its not too powerful and it tends to be a great start - or end - of the day. I'd say its a bit expensive if your not buying from Warehouse Deals so I'd check there before making the purchase.

review/summary: A decent mint
review/text: When I first found Vermints, they were in smaller tins, in three flavors--Peppermint, Cinnamint and Wintermint.  This formula has sadly been discontinued and cannot be found in stores anymore.  When I saw VerMints were back, I was quite excited.  However, the Wintermint, my flavor, is not as strong as it used to be, and I'm terribly disappointed that Cinnamint has disappeared.  I would also appreciate a Spearmint flavor.  <p>That said, it's hard to find natural, vegan mints, and this one fits that bill nicely.

review/text: I saw VerMints in a natural food store and immediately noticed the adorable illustrations. Second, they made "Wintermint" which is not available in all types of mint-making brands. Especially not those which are Vegi/Vegan friendly.<br /><br />I'm not sure how much more wonderful this flavor was before it "reappeared" in public. Its a light flavor. Think of it at the opposite end of the spectrum of something "curiously strong." I'd like to think its "gently minty."<br /><br />I can't wait to try the other flavors and collect the adorable tins!

review/summary: Organically wonderful!
review/text: I have a problem with most of these types of meal bars.  They tend to be chalky in texture and rather tasteless, or the taste they do have is artificial in flavor and comes across as `tasting healthy' or `tasting diet' and that is never a good thing.  To be honest, I'm not a gigantic fan of the other flavors Clif offers.  The chocolate ones all taste very much the same, and that solitary taste is not welcoming to me.  They don't taste awful (I've had much worse) but they aren't anything I'd rush out to eat again.<br /><br />These Oatmeal bars are a different story.<br /><br />Seriously, with the texture of a chewy cookie, this bar is satisfying in every sense of the word.  I love the size of these guys, perfectly suited for a breakfast on the go.  They taste just wonderful, lacking any and all chalky or artificialness reminiscent of most healthy bars.  Instead, you get an organic treat that doesn't skimp on the taste.  It's a great source of energy and nutrition too.<br /><br />As far as these things go, I've yet to have better!

The taste is similar too but Mango is better. A 50/50 mix of the two is better than any one alone.<br /><br />We use the Splenda packets so there are hardly any calories (Splenda has 3.5 calories per packet but it can be labeled as 0 calories since it is under 5). Splenda tastes just like sugar with no bad aftertaste. We have changed to using slightly less than 8 cups of water to make the taste richer. We have also increased the Splenda to 12 packets (1/2 cup) to make it sweeter.

This Kool-Aid flavor (not available in stores locally) is the secret, mixed with a non-bitter stevia sweetener, my home-brewed kombucha made from green tea, and various flavors (depending on the occasion) of brewed iced tea, with plenty of ice.  Sometimes I even carbonate the result, using a pressurized home carbonator.

review/summary: Good carrots - Sneaky company - Beware
review/text: This case of Libby's carrots arrived in good shape; the case of cans itself was shrink wrapped in plastic plus packing material to protect the case in the packing box. However, the cans in the CENTER of the case were severely dented. The cans on the exterior were perfect. This occurred with 5 cases of different Libby's vegetables. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who did this. Guess Libby's packers were instructed to slip the damaged ones in the center; even if you saw this case displayed in a store you would never know till you paid for them & opened them up, & then it's too late. Amazon has been great about this issue, but the fault was not Amazon's, it is clearly Libby's. The carrots are fine but I took off a star for Libby's sneaky practice & for paying for 12 cans and having to throw out 4. What a disgrace. If this happens to you,  call & let them know; it is totally unacceptable.
