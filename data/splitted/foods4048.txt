review/summary: Peppermint-licious
review/text: Looking for a plain water substitute, I discovered the natural peppermint taste of Metromint to be my new beverage of choice. The refreshing, invigorating taste really lifts your mood, at work, exercise class and every other minute of the day. The peppermint essence is delightfully well balanced, without being overpowering. I really can't stop drinking the peppermint Metromint water and now carry a bottle with me wherever I go.<br /> Drinking more water is part of my personal self improvement program. I was having a difficult time drinking enough Plain Jane water, so I tried the natural uplifting Metromint flavors. Several of the flavors are good, but the Peppermint is the most refreshing. The only drawback is the ability to buy the product locally, for a reasonable price. If I could buy the product by the case, I would.

review/text: I got the variety pack of waters, and really like them!  Very refreshing flavors,<br />especially the Spearmint...my 3 year old calls the Peppermint water "candy water".<br />The Lemon mint is my least favorite, but I added some stevia to it and that helped<br />with the flavor.  The flavors are just right, not too strong, not weak.  These are<br />not sweet, if you want sweet you have to add it yourself.<br />I want to try other flavors now as well...especially the chocolate!

review/summary: Spearmint Metromint - A Winner!
review/text: I first tried Metromint when I visited my daughter in Spokane Washington around 6 years ago. I am from Kansas so when I got back home I tried to find it in stores near me. I first found it in Overland Park by accident at a store across from the college I attended. I was so happy. I would buy a dozen at a time. I then found it in Topeka, which is closer to me. I still have to drive 60 miles to pick some up but I do not care. I really, really like the Spearmint flavor. It is so cool and refreshing. When it is ice cold, it almost takes your breath away. I LOVE IT!

It's fantastic that it's available on amazon now... this flavor always sells out at the markets near me because it's so delicious. This is the healthy way to brighten up your day with a little chocolate! Plus, the mint makes metromint water extra refreshing! So good!!

I'm not a fan of Peppermint or Lemonmint, they are just a little too minty for me.

review/text: I found this water for the first time at the Philadelphia Airport and bought a bottle for a long flight across the country. As soon as I tried it I wished I had bought a few! I wanted to cut out sugary drinks from my diet and get to drinking more water, but have SUCH a sweet tooth. This was the perfect drink! You're still getting the benefits of drinking water, but with a little bit of sweetness to it. Very satisfying. Even my husband, who has no tolerance for artifical flavors and was born without a sweet tooth, loved it. Glad to see Amazon has it readily available now. I'm hooked. Absolute favorite drink!

review/summary: Lemony Goodness
review/text: Let me start this off by saying that at 24 years old, I still had to force myself to drink water rather than juices, sodas and the like.  That being said, after finding metromint, I have that problem no more.  While I enjoy many of the flavors of metromint, Lemon is by far my favorite.  When I do drink water, it has to be as cold as possible.  With metromint, that kick of mint tricks me into thinking it is cold even if it's room temperature.  Due to this, I keep bottles of it everywhere!  Although some places run it on sale frequently, for me I find it cheapest and easiest to purchase on Amazon, especially if you are a prime member.  I also highly recommend the spearmint, chocolate, and peppermint.

Unfortunately, the reason for the sale in the grocery was because they discontinued carrying the product and it has been hard to find ever since then.

review/text: I first discovered this product a few years back at my local grocery store.  The fact it's flavored ALL NATURALLY without any sugar or sweetness is what drove me to try it.  I absolutely LOVED every sip!  So much so, I went back and bought every bottle on the shelf!  It has since disappeared permanently from all major stores in my area, so I am estastic to see it here on Amazon!  I stocked up before a week long trip to Lake Havasu, and all my girls and I enjoyed the variety of flavors (see Peppermint, Spearmint, and Good Berry Mint) instead of Gatorade and juice drinks!  The girls never missed the sugar and we didn't have any crazy sugar crashes in the afternoon.<br /><br />If you add lemon to your water, this is a great refreshing change and the mint is the perfect compliment!!!<br /><br />BEST SERVED ICE COLD

review/text: I drink Metromint on a regular basis and I can't say enough good things about it. Water + mint with no added sweeteners, no calories, no guilt!  I like to take the peppermint flavor and put it in my freezer to the point where it just starts to get icy... there is nothing more refreshing on a hot summer day!  If you want an unsweetened drink that's big on flavor, give this a shot!

I think its great the water is so inexpensive as well. Peppermint and spearamint are my favorite. Now if we could get some sort of cinamint and my life will be complete.

review/text: I love both the Lemonmint and Peppermint flavored water!  I was first introduced to this product at a Whole Foods market and loved it, but since I live 2 hours from the closest Whole Foods, I was delighted when I found it on Amazon.  This water is served best very cold and the flavor is cool and refreshing.  The lemon is not overpowering at all.  I also like it because the mint/lemon flavors seem to decrease my appetite as well, which is nice since I'm currently trying to shed a few extra pounds!!  Definitely a 5-star product and I will be buying more!!

review/text: Metromint produced the perfect product!  I am not a water drinker, and I dislike carbonated and diet drinks. When this product came along,  I found the perfect zero calorie drink, not carbonated, with a refreshing mint flavor. Perfect way to hydrate, especially if you're not a water drinker. I just love the spearmint, lemon mint and orange mint.  So glad to find Metromint on Amazon, as Metromint was hard to find  in CT. Thank you, Metromint for helping to keep me healthy!

review/summary: A very quick addict
review/text: A dear friend sent me a sample case of MetroMint, and I was a little skeptical. Minty water? Eh.<br />I took a sip, and it was interesting. Took another, and it started to grow on me.  The non-mint flavor (chocolate, cherry, etc) is so subtle, really more of an aftertaste. And the mint is light and refreshing. It makes my whole mouth feel fresh and cool, and I can feel it tingling all the way down into my stomach.<br /><br />MetroMint definitely tastes different (to me, better) when refrigerated. It subdues the mint a little and allows the supporting flavor to shine through more strongly. After finishing that gift sample case, I was hooked. MetroMint has been in my fridge every since. I've tried going back to Propel, and Propel has become to sweet and cloying for me. The lightness of MetroMint is absolutely fantastic.

review/text: I got my first bottle at the health food store so that I could try it out. I don't drink products with fruit or any kind of sweetener or added acids, so this was perfect. I love the taste of Spearmint. Yes, it tastes like Spearmint gum, which is my favorite gum flavor. But the flavor is not so strong that it is overwhelming. Just refreshing. I prefer it over peppermint.<br /><br />My daughter loves it too and is going to quit chewing gum (it gives her the sniffles) and start drinking this water.<br /><br />Even better it's offered on Amazon Prime. Prime is perfect for us, because our nearest health food store is an hour away. Now I can get it in a couple of days and save the gasoline and sales tax. Perfect!<br /><br />I'll be buying a bunch of this. Love it!

Metromint tastes great and finally enabled me to enjoy drinking water.  HOWEVER, for the first time I bought Metromint from somewhere other than Whole Foods at Amazon and the seller made their own water with a mint taste and poured it into old Metromint bottles.  I couldn't believe it!  Someone actually made their own water with mint and went through the trouble of putting it into old Metromint bottles and sold them on Amazon.  Fortunately I got my money back but beware!!!

review/text: I started buying this product from my local grocery store at $2 per bottle. Every time i'd go, they would end up being out of it, though. So I have since participated in Amazon's subscribe and save and it's fantastic. I get 12 of these bottles delivered right to my door for about $6 cheaper than I would get them if I drove to the grocery store.<br /><br />As for the product itself.. it's not like your typical flavored water. I really enjoy the minty lemon flavor. I mostly only drink water, but sometimes crave something with flavor, so Metromint Lemonmint does that job for me well.<br /><br />The rest of the flavors that I have tried are just okay for the most part. Spearmint is really good as well.

review/summary: Goodbye, Hairballs and Vomit
review/text: Our cat has had all sorts of digestive issues over the years, and after cleaning vomit off of our carpet time and time again, and after all other treatments suggested by our vet failed, we happened upon this miracle working cat food (at the suggestion of another vet). Our cat has been eating Special 33 for a couple of years now, and her hairball and other vomiting issues are a rarity now rather than the norm. She wasn't thrilled with the taste of this food at first, but we took care of that by sprinkling a flavored digestive supplement on it, which has the added bonus of making her poop almost odor free (until we started using the powder it smelled awful!). I had been making out of the way trips to our local pet store to buy this food, so I was pleased to discover that I could buy it on Amazon instead, and it costs less!

review/summary: GREAT cat food!
review/text: So my younger cat had the worst-smelling, watery poop for 2 months and I initially thought it was because of a plant he ingested but I knew it was taking too long for him to return to normal, especially after using FortiFlora probiotics as prescribed by the vet. I finally realized that his PurinaOne kibble may be the main source of the problem. I ordered a bag here off Amazon and immediately transitioned him and my other cat to this new food by mixing 50/50 with the old food and using only the new food by day 3, just so they could have a few days to get used to it.  I was expecting that they wouldn't like it because they tend to be picky (like most cats), but I was wrong; they LOVED it!  I was pleasantly surprised by the odor of the food as it smells really fresh and the bag has a zipped closure to keep freshness sealed in.<br /><br />Fast-forward a month and a half and Kitty's poop has now been solid since day 3 and no longer stinks up the house (thank goodness).  They're on their second bag and I will probably feed them this for the rest of their long lives.

review/text: Royal Canin is the only cat food that my cats stomach can tolerate.  I have five cats and that can be a problem to find a cat food that they all can eat.  I would suggest if anyone has a cat with a sensitive stomach to use the Royal Canin Special 33 for sensitive stomachs.  What else can I say, but this is the best I have found and I have tried a lot of different cat food.  They only get the dry food, the moist food of any kind seems to give them a stomach problem.

review/text: I have a one year old Bengal. When I picked him up at nine weeks the breeder said I should feed Royal Canin kitten food. Once he got to nine months I thought I would save $ by buying Iams kitten and ultimatly adult. Shortly after we started potty training with CitiKitty. With this system waste must be removed at once, the toilet insert only holds a small amount of litter. It was then I noticed he had very soft stools. At first I though it was because he doesn't deal with any change in his environment. It didn't get better as he got use to the insert. Switch to Royal Canin Special 33 and within three days his stools firmed up and his coat has gotten more luxurious(an extra benefit). He also poops less.

It's costly, but if you have a cat with digestive problems I recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: Our 10 year old cat has had problems for a while with keeping his food down. Even the most sensitive brands that you buy at the supermarket make him throw his food back up shortly after eating. It was getting to where he would vomit every time he ate. We tried several more expensive brands, and while they helped, they didn't do the trick. This is the ONLY food that he can keep down...he went from throwing up every meal, to only throwing up once every week and a half. HUGE improvement! Both our cats love the taste as well. A little expensive, but totally worth it.

review/text: I have a Bengal.  The breed is notorious for their digestive problems due to the fact that they are hybrids.  My cat has had chronic diarrhea since he was a kitten - and I mean non- stop.  Thousands of dollars at the vet on tests/meds.  Tried buying probiotics which was also a massive fail.  His poop stank so bad that even the crystal litter had to be thrown out every couple of days (supposed to last a month).  Three weeks on this and for the first time in his kitty life we have normal cat poopies.  His coat is gleaming and I might even show him.  Thank you Royal Canin!

review/summary: My Cats All Love It (But.....)
review/text: I normally pick up the RC Special 33 formula at my local pet food supply chain. However, prices keep creeping up and now they want $29 (before tax) for a 7 pound bag. So this month, I ordered Royal Canin via Amazon, and also grabbed a bag of RC Indoor 27. I am saving $8 or $9 on each bag and it's being delivered to my front door! All my cats gobble up the Special 33 (higher fat content than Indoor 27), originally intended for my vomit-breakfast cat, Sage. Generally, Sage does not toss her cookies after eating Special 33. But it always helps to give her Halo wet food first to settle her tummy and then the kibble. However, there was a different problem with my Special 33 dry food order. The first night, the cats didn't seem interested it in and left a lot on their plates. Odd. The next morning it was gone so they eventually ate it. Next night, I happened to be in the kitchen under bright lights when I noticed the kibble looked shiny and wet. I scooped up some in my hand and it was literally oil soaked. Somehow this particular batch had gone wrong. RC headquarters in Missouri told me it was probably due to how the food was stored or shipped (very hot or very cold temperatures) that made the injected oils seep out. Who knows. I'm thinking perhaps it stayed too long under the appetite enhancer spray machine at the factory (they do that, you know). I threw it out and Amazon happily and easily shipped me another bag. Keeping fingers crossed that this bag of Special 33 will be just fine.<br />Update May 2012: After buying several bags of Special 33 Royal Canin and verifying they were fine when I first opened them, after a day or two, the dry food again became slick and overly moist. I have determined that the food is just fine but it is altered by exposure to air somehow. My kitchen is not too warm nor too cold so I don't understand why the formula changes. One of the ingredients must pull in moisture, sort of like the latest and most expensive women's anti-aging creams that hydrate.

review/summary: Fantastic fun soda!
review/text: Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The melon flavor reviewed here has a very unique taste. Think honeydew more than watermelon, sweet and light with that distinctive Ramune lemon-lime backbone flavor holding everything together. Truly a treat.<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more. Ramune is easy to find at just about any Asian market, but for those who don't have easy access to one, ordering here on Amazon would be recommended.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.

review/text: It's definitely an item for tourists. If you don't know how to open one, don't throw away the cap and look up some how-tos from youtube.<br /><br />The flavor is hard to describe. It's VERY sweet. If you've smelled melon-scented lotions or perfumes, this would be its flavor. Whenever I see someone selling this, melon (and strawberry) is usually one of the first to sell out, so grab one if you see one. If you're unsure if you'll like it, try the original flavor (sweet like a bubble gum flavor) first.

I'd been drinking First Colony French Roast for almost 50 years and was having a hard time finding coffee which measured up to what I felt was a perfect cup of coffee.  Now, I don't have to look any further.  The French Roast is dark, full bodied, has a nice aroma, and is not as expensive as some of the other gourmet coffees available on Amazon.  I'll be buying more.

I like to use them to flavour coffee.<br /><br />The almond extract is  a product to restore your faith in people.  It  is intoxicatingly delicious. It does not smell in the least artificial. It has a complex odour. It is a bit like Christmas past in a bottle. Nielsen-Massey set out to make the best extract on earth taking no shortcuts. It is potent. In fact, it is so strong, it is hard not to over do it. I found just moistening a finger and rubbing around the lip of cup of coffee is often too much. It should come with some sort of eye dropper for measuring out tiny amounts. I added it to the endorsements on my own personal web page I was so impressed. The orange extract is similarly magnificent and potent.

And it is Ok, but I still don't like artificial flavorings.  It smells that way to me.  It reminds me of the smell of those old fashioned maple nut candies.  It was a little expensive too.  I can't say that this brand is better than the one (vanilla-butter-nut) in the grocery store.  This stuff is quite concentrated and these four packs will probably last the average cook about 5 years.

review/summary: A Delicious Choice for Raisin Lovers Everywhere
review/text: I am looking at a box of these raisins as I write this review; this product is a staple food in our house. I am a dedicated fan of raisins and enjoy snacking on them and adding them to a variety of other dishes.<br /><br />One of my favorite evening meals is a bowl of Grape Nuts with a liberal supply of raisins mixed in; this is a nourishing combination that is very satisfying to me and has actually been a player in my weight loss program. One of its advantages is it keeps hunger under control longer and I'm less tempted to snack in the evenings. I don't know about you, but I need all the help I can get in that department.<br /><br />One of the things I do to help control dryness is to wrap the opened raisin box in one of the plastic bags one gets in the vegetable department of most grocery stores. I've found that the raisins have a slight tendency to dry out a bit even at the rate in which I eat them and the extra bagging helps keep the raisins moist all the way through the box.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention another one of my favorite health snacks involving raisins; I love to mix them with whole raw almonds and really enjoy that combination as a snack between meals.<br /><br />If you enjoy raisins, this is a perfect choice!

review/summary: Vegan Organic Kosher Choice
review/text: Vegan. Organic. Kosher. Lush, luxe dark chocolate. Very smooth. Dark chocolate flavor notes are very long and enjoyable. Not excessively bitter at all, but the taste of chocolate is not masked or overwhelmed with the added raw cane sweetness and is without other added oils or flavorings. Thick, long-lasting consistency. Well balanced and a good choice for chocolate purists. Great value for a high quality organic chocolate. Made with 72% organic cocoa and organic raw cane sugar only. 570 calories per 3.5oz/100g bar. One half (or less) of a whole bar is a nice serving. The remaining portion can be saved in an airtight container or ziplock bag for another day. Best stored at room [~70F/21C] temperature. Kosher "D" from processing on shared equipment. Product of Germany. [The ingredients list includes "cocoa liquor" and "cocoa butter" separately which are both derived from processing of raw cocoa beans. Both are just technical terms for cocoa components and are 100% plant-based from the cocoa bean only and contain no dairy or alcohol or fermentation.] This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference.

review/text: As of the date of this review, the product title indicates "dark chocolate with orange flavor," but the picture and description are for their regular 72% dark chocolate bars.<br /><br />Vivani is perhaps my favorite chocolate, so I took a chance on this ambigious product hoping to get the 72% cocoa version.<br /><br />Bzzzzt.  They sent me the orange flavored stuff.  But I called and asked Amazon to try again.  Bingo!  Got the good stuff.  But both versions had the same ASIN numbers on the boxes....<br /><br />Anyway, IMHO Vivani makes some of the best tasting off-the-shelf dark chocolate you can buy.  I like their 85% cocoa even better, but Amazon doesn't stock it, and the 72% is very good (and less expensive than my local store).<br /><br />Compared to the other dark chocolate Amazon offers (Cote D'or), the Vivani is much smoother, tastier, less flat, and better texture.

review/text: This was our first Vivani Organic Dark Chocolate Bars and it was delicious! It has a deep chocolate taste without the deep bitterness so often found in dark chocolate. The flavor is just a rich chocolate that melts easily in your mouth.  Great for eating chocolate or used for a GF lava cake.<br /><br />My only negative is that the chocolate bars were melted somewhat so the aluminum wrap is partially buried under some of the chocolate bar.  I had several different chocolate bars in the same shipement that were not melted so I don't know what happened to these bars.  However, the melting problem is a transportation problem and does not deter my review for this wonderful chocolate. If you like the smoothness of German chocolates, this is a must try bar.

review/text: In recent years I have evolved into a chocolate snob.  As a nutritionist, I am also health conscious and anxious to avoid unnecessary additives when possible.  A deep, smooth quality chocolate, this bar was everything I wanted. For one, it did not contain soy lecithin, one of the few chocolate bars that does not.  Its rich dark color and mild bitterness are consistent with a bar high in polyphenols. However, if you are used to milk chocolate you may want to start off with a bar that is 60% and work your way up to 70-85%.  The darker chocolates generally contain less sugar than your average milk chocolate bar. Finally, the price was good and even better than what I might pay in the store for a lower quality chocolate.

review/summary: not what I expected
review/text: I bought this as a gift for a person who enjoys dark chocolate.  I thought it would be a gift that she could enjoy as candy.  Probably my mistake.  The bars are very rich and could be used for baking but not as candy.  My error but still not what I expected when I ordered them.
