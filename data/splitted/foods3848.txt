review/summary: I thought this was fine, but....
review/text: For 11 bucks a box, I was not expecting this to taste like gourmet Coffee shop coffee... lets be reasonable people, you get what you pay for .... for less than 50 cents a cup, you have to expect something less than what you'd get even at the gas station for a buck a cup... I thought this was on par, if not better, than some convenience store coffee drinks I've gotten in the past. I know a lot of people have issue with the ingredient list containing hydrogenated oils, or whatever, but this is exactly why you should buy something in person first before doing so online.  (Or else google the list of ingredients, which is what I would have done had little things like that concerned me) I took off one star because the sucralose seems to give it an slightly displeasing aftertaste, but thats true of all artificial sweeteners for me.

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: I tried the Gloria Jean's cappuccino and was disappointed.  It was not bad, it just didnt taste like  or have the texture of cappuccino.<br /><br />This stuff does indeed taste like gas station instatnt cappuccino but I would not expect a real cappuccino to come out of an instant coffee machine (which is really what the Kuerig is).  That is just not realistic.<br /><br />This product actually does taste like cappuccino and has the foam.  Considering its coming out of a K cup, that is good enough to impress me.  When I want real cappuccino, I will break out whole beans and my frother.  When I want a quick cappuccino fix, I will use this.

review/text: This taste more like French Vanilla Hot Cocoa than coffee, and I was pleasantly surprised! It still has enough coffee taste that you realize it does have some in it, but it's smooth and creamy like Hot Cocoa. I've become a quick fan, and like it so much that I'm gonna sign up for the subscribe & save to receive a box every two months. Since the coffee taste isn't too overpowering, it makes an amazing drink for a cold winter night. Perfect something to warm you up!<br /><br />P.S<br />Top it with some whip cream, DELICIOUS!

review/text: I had to come back to edit my review after originally giving this product 5 stars.  Something has gone terribly wrong with this product.  I used to love it,  but now they are just terrible.  I don't know if they changed the formula or what the problem is, but there is a terrible after taste that never used to be there before.  I've heard other customers complain about it, but I had no idea what they were talking about.  I thought they were crazy.  Turns out they were right!  Not every cup, but at least 1/2 of the last shipment had cappuchino's cups that had a very bad after taste.  Why not all?  Can't tell you. When they taste bad they taste really bad and I found myself not even being able to finish.  I'm so dissapointed....

review/text: I am not one of the super picky coffee people out there.  Before my favorite coffee was from Starbucks, the Caramel Machiato.  But I absolutely LOVE this coffee.  I don't really care that it is instant, because I think it tastes really good.  My favorite thing is that on the medium Keurig setting I do not have to do a thing to it to enjoy it.  No sugar, no cream, no nothing.  Just pop the K-cup in, hit the button and enjoy.  If you are not a really big coffee snob and like sweet flavored coffees you might love this one, I do.

review/summary: Convenience Store Cappuccino
review/text: I was so excited to see this product (Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino) for my beloved Keurig.  I usually brew flavored coffee into a mug of heated milk & a touch of sugar.  I thought this would be a step faster & a step up from my usual morning cup.  I was dismayed to read that the first ingredient is partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, but I figured I'd make the small nutritional sacrifice in the name of morning caffeine happiness.  Well, it turns out the taste is nothing like a true cappuccino, but almost identical to a convenience store (7/11) machine cappuccino.  If you love that flavor, you'll love this k-cup.  I thought those instant-flavored coffees were GREAT when I was a college student!)<br /><br />Another complaint about this new k-cup is that the box suggests you run a hot water cycle (sans k-cup) after making the cappuccino.  I presume this is to rinse out any dairy or sugar product which could muck up your machine.  I'm glad for the tip, but wish I didn't have to run down the water in my reservoir.<br /><br />I'd hate to throw this coffee out, so this morning I brewed a cup of this and then followed it with a plain coffee k-cup.  It isn't as sweet and has more "real" coffee in it, but it still tastes very artificial.  FYI: In addition to the artificial dairy & sweeteners, the cappuccino uses instant coffee.)

review/text: I thought the flavor was decent, but that it just reminded my husband and I too much of something we would buy at our local gas station. This specific K-cup only makes a very small cup before turning into just dumping water, and therefore was never sufficient for my husband to drink. I should have read the reviews before purchasing, as it seems that others are having some similar feelings!

review/text: If you're expecting a real cup of cappuccino you'll be disappointed. This isn't a creamy, frothy cappuccino, at best it's the same as the powdered "gas station" cappuccino you can buy at, well, the gas station. If you read the ingredients you'll see "instant coffee" listed, as well as artificial sweetners.<br /><br />I don't really mind this kind of cappuccino-ish drink once in a while, but be prepared for a very sweet drink. In addition to the super sweet flavor it was the only kCup I've ever had explode, and the company wasn't really interested in hearing about it.<br /><br />This flavor is something I definately won't be purchasing again, and the ones I have left are my emergency stash for when I'm out of everything else and unable to go to the store.

review/summary: Pretty good if you aren't fancy like me
review/text: First off let me say what kind of coffee drinker I am. Before getting the Keurig, I drank mostly Folders medium blend. I don't have anything against gas station coffee - in fact I drink a lot of it. I like the cappuccino that you can get at a Casey's. I don't like the vending machine coffees at all - too chalky and gritty.<br /><br />Now on to my thoughts on this coffee - reminds me a lot of what I can get at Casey's - pretty sweet stuff. At Casey's gas station I usually get 2/3 cappuccino and 1/3 coffee. This isn't necessary to "water-down" with coffee. It is just right to me.

Also, the instructions on the box state to run a cycle of hot water through the Keurig after the Grove Square, otherwise it will clog the machine; same goes for hot chocolate, and apple cider k-cups....JimMc

review/summary: Tastes ok, but instants clog Keurigs
review/text: It wasn't until my Keurig got "backed up" and only dispensed a half-cup that I realized these were instant and as such, required special cleaning. These are not the brew kind so after making a cup, you need to run 1-2 cups of water through the Keurig or the needle and bottom of the filter dispenser/spout (I have no idea what it is called) gets clogged. I clean my Keurig frequently, but these and the hot cocoas are really not worth the hassle of two cups of water after every cup I make. The cappuccino tins from like International Coffee or a packet of swiss miss, etc are much less fuss.<br /><br />As others posted, the taste is off as well. If you want to know what they taste like, go to your local gas station and find the "caramel cappuccino" dispenser and try that.

review/summary: Gas station cappuccino...and that's a good thing!
review/text: I must concur with previous reviews stating that if you like "convenience store caps",you'll probably be OK with this product.I used two 6oz passes through our Keurig,added an ounce of liquid French Vanilla creamer and then ran the mix through a Latte blender we have.Although a tad thin(next time-2oz of creamer),the end result compared very favorably with the local 7-11 caps,which my wife and I both love.As for previous remarks about sucralose;if I hadn't already known it was there-I wouldn't have known it was there(cannot speak to medical aversions,you're kind of on your own there).Bottom line;at $.35/cup vs $1.50 & up,this does the trick!

Very good!<br /><br />EDITED: I love sweet coffee, but after three times of trying it I've decided this is WAY too sweet, and I wouldn't buy it again.  I changed my rating from 5 to 3 stars.

It is basically the powdered cappuccino mix in a k-cup. There is no filter inside it so you can't re-use them if you were going to use the K-Saver metal caps to re-use your k-cups.  Also you can't use them for more than one cup as you can some regular ground coffee k-cups.  Overall though - the flavor is excellent and well worth the 4 stars!

With 80 calories a serving, it's easier on their waistlines too.  It's not even close to coffee shop cappuccino, which I prefer and they loathe.  I admit, it is a nice frothy drink, but if you're looking for "real" cappuccino, you will probably want to avoid this.

review/summary: Restaurant quality cappuccino
review/text: I was a bit hesitant to buy cappuccino K-cups.  After all, I had been using the cappuccino mix from Sams Club that provided a very good cappuccion.  It wasn't restaurant quality, but it was good.  Mix is soluable and doesn't need to be brewed.  The Sam's Club mix was cheaper, so why switch?  After the first sip, I was hooked.  This may not be the best cup of cappuccino that I ever had, but it is one of the best and far superior to many cappuccinos served at restaraunts and at 50 cents a mug, is a bargain considering the quality.  I recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: After taste not that good
review/text: The machine empties the k cup, it's dry contents.  Not all that good, watery even on the low setting of hot water. I won't get them again, yes they are worse than convenient store.<br /><br />Not worth my wait. Even at the price won't get them again.  That fake sugar after taste is not good, just like the reviewer said.  Had to try for myself, so probably will you but you won't like it either.<br /><br />Good luck still lookin for a replacement for the coffee cups.

review/summary: Not As Good as the Grove Square Caramel Cappucino Flavor
review/text: I bought my son a huge variety of Kcups to go with his new Keurig coffee maker. After tasting about 20 flavors so far, this is the only one that we didn't love. It's not disgusting, but it's just not too flavorful. It had an odd aftertaste to it. We also bought the Grove Square Caramel Cappuccino and I thought that flavor was 10x better.<br /><br />We'll use these up, but I probably won't purchase this flavor again.

review/summary: Creamy goodness
review/text: I recently bought a Keurig so I'm trying out different coffees.  I first found Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino in the grocery store.  Now I buy it in bulk at Amazon. I usually drink plain coffee, but sometimes, when I have the option, I'll choose hazelnut over other flavors.  I was so impressed with this cappuccino.  First, while brewing, the aroma was heavenly.  The first sip continued the experience.  It was quite creamy, and had a strong, but not overpowering, hazelnut taste. It was sort of like hazelnut hot chocolate.  This is the only flavor my husband drinks now and he has stopped drinking plain coffee altogether.  I hope they never stop making this.  I've tried the flavored hazelnut coffees, but prefer this cappuccino.  It's perfect for sipping on a cold, dreary day, or whenever you want that extra richness.

review/summary: Taste good but won't order again
review/text: Good price but this stuff is just too sweet for my liking. 80 calories a cup, 9 carbs, too much fat and sugar. The taste was good though so if you treat it more like a desert instead of an everyday morning coffee then you'll probably like it.

review/summary: Best ever
review/text: This kcup gets some odd reviews but I must say it is by far the best "quickie" I have had. I either make my own latte at home the old fasshioned way or I throw in one of these in the brewer when I am in a hurry. My hubby took them to the aid station and the soldiers devoured them like they were going out of style. I love the flavor nothing needs to be added to it. A dash of whip cream is a nice granish. But locally I can't find them anywhere. Walmart had them but now they are NEVER in stock. I have written to keurig asking them to start stocking these they are worth the try... and if you don't like it send them my way :P

review/text: I am trying all types of products to use with my Keurig coffee maker and I thought the caramel cappuccino would be a good choice. It was so sweet I couldn't drink it, I had to throw it out. I have a sweet tooth and not much seems to sweet to me. I wasted my money on this and I will be throwing it out as well as the Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino that I bought! Waste of money unless you like super sweet!

review/summary: Weird aftertaste...
review/text: I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Delicious! I ordered the french vanilla cappuccino because I was looking for something delicious that doesn't require the extra effort of adding cream and sugar. This is exactly that! I went through the 24 pack in 2-3 weeks and will definitely be ordering another box soon! I would recommend these for anyone that enjoys french vanilla flavor and normally adds cream and sugar to their coffee.
