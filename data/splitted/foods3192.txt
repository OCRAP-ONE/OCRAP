review/summary: It really is sweet!
review/text: I usually put creamer in my coffee, and I thought previous reviewers were probably nuts to think that a K-Cup coffee could produce something that didn't need sweetener.  Wrong!  This truly doesn't need any sweeteners/creamers.  It's sweet and creamy all its own!  Very good!<br /><br />EDITED: I love sweet coffee, but after three times of trying it I've decided this is WAY too sweet, and I wouldn't buy it again.  I changed my rating from 5 to 3 stars.

review/summary: Love the flavor damage to cups un-acceptable
review/text: Love the flavor of these cappuccino cups they are the right level of sweet for my particular taste<br /><br />That being said the number of damaged cups was un-acceptable it must have been something before boxing because the box the cups come in had no damage at all but 5 of the cups were smashed beyond recognition with the foil ripped and the sides of the some of the cups perforated that's over 20% damaged and useless!<br /><br />I really wish quality control had caught this and I could give it a higher review but with the expense of K cups already having to throw 20% out is not a good thing

review/text: This product tastes okay, but is definitely quite sweet.  Maybe I missed something, but I couldn't find the calorie content prior to ordering and foolishly ordered any way.  One review I read said there is 60 calories, but it is 80 calories a cup per the packaging, I probably wouldn't have ordered.  This will be a one time per day drink...also has a bad aftertaste.  On a positive note, the pricing is reasonable...however with one a day, it is going to take me two months to go through this drink that I am not crazy about.

That said it is not bad its is instant though so think those machines at the gas station that you pick your flavor from- that's what it is. I would but again but for different reasons NOT a morning pick me up. its also loaded with sugar and fat so dieters beware/

review/text: Even for my hubby who likes just a little coffee with his cream and sugar (lol) this was perfect as is straigh from the Keurig machine!  I love how it tastes as well.  It is basically the powdered cappuccino mix in a k-cup. There is no filter inside it so you can't re-use them if you were going to use the K-Saver metal caps to re-use your k-cups.  Also you can't use them for more than one cup as you can some regular ground coffee k-cups.  Overall though - the flavor is excellent and well worth the 4 stars!

review/text: This coffee was WAY too sweet for me, I used one and I'm giving the rest to a good home.  By way of reference, I normally put a teaspoon of flavored creamer and 1-2 packs of splenda in a cup of coffee, so I do like mine doctored.  This reminded me of those nasty international delight flavored coffees.  It also clogged the needle on my keurig which was a pain to clean.  Never again!

review/summary: Frothy instant cappucccino - my gang loves it!
review/text: My guys travel frequently and like the sweet, frothy convenience store cappuccino.  This is a great replacement at much lower cost per cup.  With 80 calories a serving, it's easier on their waistlines too.  It's not even close to coffee shop cappuccino, which I prefer and they loathe.  I admit, it is a nice frothy drink, but if you're looking for "real" cappuccino, you will probably want to avoid this.

review/summary: Restaurant quality cappuccino
review/text: I was a bit hesitant to buy cappuccino K-cups.  After all, I had been using the cappuccino mix from Sams Club that provided a very good cappuccion.  It wasn't restaurant quality, but it was good.  Mix is soluable and doesn't need to be brewed.  The Sam's Club mix was cheaper, so why switch?  After the first sip, I was hooked.  This may not be the best cup of cappuccino that I ever had, but it is one of the best and far superior to many cappuccinos served at restaraunts and at 50 cents a mug, is a bargain considering the quality.  I recommend it without reservation.

It's not disgusting, but it's just not too flavorful. It had an odd aftertaste to it.

review/text: I recently bought a Keurig so I'm trying out different coffees.  I first found Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino in the grocery store.  Now I buy it in bulk at Amazon. I usually drink plain coffee, but sometimes, when I have the option, I'll choose hazelnut over other flavors.  I was so impressed with this cappuccino.  First, while brewing, the aroma was heavenly.  The first sip continued the experience.  It was quite creamy, and had a strong, but not overpowering, hazelnut taste. It was sort of like hazelnut hot chocolate.  This is the only flavor my husband drinks now and he has stopped drinking plain coffee altogether.  I hope they never stop making this.  I've tried the flavored hazelnut coffees, but prefer this cappuccino.  It's perfect for sipping on a cold, dreary day, or whenever you want that extra richness.

review/text: This kcup gets some odd reviews but I must say it is by far the best "quickie" I have had. I either make my own latte at home the old fasshioned way or I throw in one of these in the brewer when I am in a hurry. My hubby took them to the aid station and the soldiers devoured them like they were going out of style. I love the flavor nothing needs to be added to it. A dash of whip cream is a nice granish. But locally I can't find them anywhere. Walmart had them but now they are NEVER in stock. I have written to keurig asking them to start stocking these they are worth the try... and if you don't like it send them my way :P

review/text: I am trying all types of products to use with my Keurig coffee maker and I thought the caramel cappuccino would be a good choice. It was so sweet I couldn't drink it, I had to throw it out. I have a sweet tooth and not much seems to sweet to me. I wasted my money on this and I will be throwing it out as well as the Grove Square Hazelnut Cappuccino that I bought! Waste of money unless you like super sweet!

review/summary: Weird aftertaste...
review/text: I'm an avid K cup user - coffee, tea, cocoa - and have my favorites and not-so-favorites, but dang... This one started off tasting okay, but actually gave me indigestion (burp!). There's a disturbing metallic, cloyingly sweet aftertaste in my mouth too. Your mileage may vary, but this is one K cup flavor I won't be revisiting.

review/text: Delicious! I ordered the french vanilla cappuccino because I was looking for something delicious that doesn't require the extra effort of adding cream and sugar. This is exactly that! I went through the 24 pack in 2-3 weeks and will definitely be ordering another box soon! I would recommend these for anyone that enjoys french vanilla flavor and normally adds cream and sugar to their coffee.

review/summary: Wow.... lots of saturated fat
review/text: There are 80 calories per cup of this coffee, 40 of those are from fat. The description says it is mildly sweet but I found it overwhelmingly sweet. There was little to no coffee taste, more like Cremora or Coffee Mate with fake sugar. I tried brewing one k cup of this coffee and then in the same cup added another k cup which was regular coffee in hopes of diluting the sweetness but even that way, it was still very sweet and whatever creamer they used was the dominant flavor by far.<br /><br />If you take a lot of cream and sugar in your coffee, you might like this coffee. I didn't like it at all.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Normally I don't care for coffee at all, but I absolutely loved these!<br /><br />My sister got one of the Keurig coffee machines, and there were samples of the French Vanilla ones included in the box. She told me that she thought I would like them, so I gave it a shot.<br /><br />She was right! I absolutely loved the,, and after running out of the samples decided to order some from Amazon. After ordering those, I saw these Caramel flavored ones and knew I had to try them!<br /><br />I was so excited when they arrived that I didn't waste any time and instantly brewed one up and tried it. I liked it even better than the French Vanilla ones!<br /><br />For me, they were the perfect ammount of sweetness, and I didn't find there to be any weird artificial sweetner taste as some other reviwers have mentioned.<br /><br />Now I drink one of these every day. There is nothing I prefer more in the morning than one of these.<br /><br />Maybe these aren't for the hardcore coffee connoisseur, but for someone like me, they are awesome!<br /><br />I would highly recommend these to everyone. Especially people who normally don't like coffee. A+ and 5 stars in my book.

review/text: My wife and I both enjoy this cappucccino!  If you enjoy a dark roast or coffee that is bitter and dark this is not for you. Its light and the taste is easy to drink.  My wife doesn't like a cup loaded with caffeine so this fit the bill for her.  I love that I can brew and go! No sugar or creamer needed unless you have a crazy sweet tooth.  I put a couple k cups to fit in a travel mug and I'm always sorry when its gone.  That means I will have to go back to the truely terrible coffee at work!

At $7.98 a box at Walmart I can buy this and NOT have to buy those flavored creamers. I shake the cup prior to use and set the machine for 8 oz....YUM!

review/text: I was hoping for a nice creamy cappuccino for the evenings or during the day where a strong brew wasn't needed.  Well, *some* coffee flavor would have been good.  This tastes like coffeemate plus sugar plus old coffee grounds.  Its flat, sweet, thin, and ends with something of a slightly bitter aftertaste, reminiscent of aspartame...  with nothing in between.  There's not even a filter inside the k-cup...  just mostly cheap creamer...

review/text: I bought the Keurig for my husband who really did not want it.  I don't drink coffee but love, love gadgets.  So order to enjoy my new GADGET I had to find something to make.  I found Grove Square Cappuccino by accident.  I add some whipped cream on the top and what I end up with is a heavenly dessert that has none of the bitter taste of coffee.  I also bought the French Vanilla version and decided I liked it so much that I am on a monthly plan.  For anyone who loves flavored drinks this is perfect.  And my hubby finally came around and uses the Keurig for his coffee.  He does not use this drink since it does not have a coffee taste, thank goodness.<br /><br />I have been watching negatives and positives.  It is all a matter of preference and taste.  I happen to love this coffee because it is sweet and does not taste like coffee.  I simply hate coffee and this is a way to enjoy the Keurig and share some time with my husband who does drink coffee.  As for the additives... welcome to this world of the 21st century!  It satifies my sweet tooth and keeps me from eating cake, cookies, pie and ice cream.  So Grove Square bring it on.

review/summary: Price Vs. Flavor
review/text: I'm on the fence with Grove Square's Cappuccino Cups - French Vanilla.<br /><br />On one hand, for the price at least, they're great. Sadly on the other hand, they're way too sweet for an every morning drink. The first time I tried it, I had already added cream and sugar before I ever took a sip. That was a bad idea.<br /><br />I'd buy it again in a lesser Qty, but 54 of these is going to last me a long time. They aren't bad at all, I just wasn't expecting such a sweet drink.

review/summary: Not even close to Cappuccino
review/text: I bought this for my granddaughter because she will drink a cappuccino from most any where. When she was not using them, she used 2, I asked her what was wrong. Her only comment was try one. I did. Holy cow, it is almost kinda of coffer-vanilla flavored sugar water. Really NOT worth the money. Only reason for one star is that you cant give no stars.

review/summary: Just Gross
review/text: I did not like this at all, worse than the gas station cappiccino, which I do like. The grove square french vanilla is just nasty really and it leaves a bad after taste. oh and you have to run a hot water cycle after using it to clean the machine, nothing lefted in the k-cup either, well just a little bit of water to leak from the k-cup when throwing away. I will not buy this again at any price.<br />The only reason for the one star rating was because the shipping and packaging of the products was nicely done, free super saving shipping is great. I just wish the contents of said packaging had been on par. anyone know of a good cappuccino for the keurig?

review/summary: INSTANT COFFEE!
review/text: I bought this for my daughter and she was very excited to taste it but was very disappointed to find it to be INSTANT cappuccino. It tasted watered down even at the suggested cup setting. We honestly could have got a container of this same stuff at the local dollar store for a lot cheaper and then we could have added more of the powder when needed. Definitely not worth the money.

review/text: This stuff tastes great.  However, it is not really coffee.  It is a flavored drink on the order of hot cocoa.  It has a lot of calories (80 per cup) and sugar.  It also clogged up my Keurig big time.

review/summary: Hydrogenated vegetable oils?  No thanks!
review/text: Any product with hydrogenated vegetable oils as the first ingredient isn't worth buying.  This stuff has been banned in NY for a reason - it is poison for the human body. See the Wikipedia article on trans fats for more information.  Here is a clip : "Because of these facts and concerns, the NAS has concluded there is no safe level of trans fat consumption. There is no adequate level, recommended daily amount or tolerable upper limit for trans fats. This is because any incremental increase in trans fat intake increases the risk of coronary heart disease.[2] "

review/text: A friend of mine gave me several of these Grove Square Cappuccino French Vanilla k cups!! Just loved them, but could not find them available in any local store. She told me she got them from Amazon.com. We fix it with a little bit of cream whip on top! Tastes just like you bought it from a coffee shop. Have ordered more, so I never run out. You will not be sorry if your purchase this item. I did order and try the Hazelnut, liked it but not as much as this.

review/text: I can taste the sugar substitute in this quite strongly, but not enough to disgust me. I've tasted better, but seeing as it's not made by a barista and only takes 5 seconds to produce, I'd say it's not bad. I was able to drink the whole cup, and that's good enough for me. However, if the fake sugar makes you sick, I'd stay away from this. Let's just say it's not organic or homemade, which it's not claiming to be.

review/summary: A K-Cup Really???????????
review/text: I was excited to find a reasonably priced K-cup coffee.  That is until I purchased it and tried it.  This is instant coffee -it is dishonest to call it a K-Cup.  You expect real coffee whey you purchase a K-cup.  Save yourself the cost - if you really want instant coffee, buy yourself a jar of instant coffee and grab a spoon.
