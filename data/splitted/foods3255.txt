review/summary: both safer and pro-pest traps are a joke--UPDATE
review/text: after 11 days of having 2 safer traps and 2 pro-pest traps out, i have caught ONE moth in the pro-pest.  one of each trap was in a closet where moths are visibly flying around, and one each in a room with fewer moths.  during same 11 days i smashed an average of 5 moths per day by hand.  hello.  are all my moths female?  do i have an amazing amazonian colony of self-fertile females?  wow.  there is a science paper in here somewhere.<br /><br />UPDATE: per the university of california integrated pest management website [...]l there are TWO kinds of cloths moths. all pheromone moth traps on the market ONLY catch one kind of clothes moth--the webbing moth -- not the case-making moth. this will explain the love-or-hate reviews out there. traps failed for me because i have case-making moths. this is probably the case for the others whose traps failed. of course it would be clever if the manufacturers of these traps declared this on the packaging, since they no doubt know it, but that would be too responsible and cut into their profits.

review/summary: Cryptic instruction
review/text: This package contains two large pieces of folded paper, the trap frames, which are obvious. Also some small but essential pieces which are less obvious. The instructions are in various places; a bit like putting together a jigsaw puzzle where you have no idea what the result should be. Eventually I thought I had it right and then placed the traps. Tonight I found another piece, no idea what it does.<br /><br />Modern product design is supposed to accomodate both people who speak English (I do) as well as people who have a limited command of it. This needs to go back to the drawing board on that score. What they could do to improve would be walk around IKEA a bit, and then redesign their instructions so that zero words are used, and the instructions are in one single place. Or at least take a focus group of people entirely unfamiliar with moth traps and rate them on their ability to assemble this.<br /><br />I don't know whether I have put it together correctly or not, but so far the traps are empty. If you have prior experience with this product this review may sound silly; there aren't that many pieces and somebody who has done it once correctly can probably assemble them in 5 seconds flat.

review/summary: How many traps are in package?
review/text: I have bought this product in the past and it has generally worked to trap clothes moths. In the past the box that I bought had TWO assembled traps inside the box for about the current Amazon price. Now the price is about the same, but the product detail says there is only ONE trap inside the box. This means the price has doubled. The instructions suggest having more than one trap (I agree it works better with two traps) but now this price has doubled. This is not at all worth the price for only ONE trap.

review/summary: These don't work
review/text: I bought these moth traps, because the moths were eating through suits, shirts, and even my cotton shower curtain. I had them out for at least two weeks and they didn't catch one moth. If I could give these traps a"0" I would because that is how many moths they caught. I started using Pro-Pest Pheronet "Pheromone Trap" and they caught moths right away and many of them, by day's end.

review/summary: Works slowly but surely
review/text: A few weeks after putting these out, they are filled with dozens of moths. They work, although not immediately. But they are the best solution to a problem that is not going away. I washed my clothing before setting them out, hopefully killing all the eggs/larvae that existed. Now I just have to make sure that the adult moths don't survive long enough to eat all my clothes. I know they are working, because I can see them, dead in the trap. I estimate that the traps catch about 4-5 moths a day. I have 4 traps in the house, one in each closet.

review/summary: Underwhelmed
review/text: Did not see much for results from this product. I put one of these and a fly strip in the same room. I got dozens of moths stuck in the fly strip and only one in this moth alert trap. So the fly strip gave me much more of an alert than this moth trap.I put another trap in an area that had some yarn and where we have seen moths occasionally. It caught zero after being there for weeks. So the product was not a good match for me. Maybe our moths are more picky than wherever this gets manufactured.

review/text: The moths attacked our walk-in closet - so I wanted to fight back with this product.  I am aware most of the damage to clothes is done by the larva - but still, when I see moths still sitting on the wall waiting for their mate about 3 feet from this so-called trap, it is obviously not working.  My guess is the only way something will get into it this is if it randomly dies and falls into it.

review/text: I have several Navajo wool rugs on the floor so I am very concerned about moth. I had an expensive special Pendleton blanket in a box with what the seller said was moth repellent.. I discovered that it was eaten away afyter several years of storage. I bought these traps and put several in each room. After several months, I checked them and they were all filled with moths.. Conclusion? It does work.. I have been using them for several years.<br />Very highly recommended along with the herbal repellent packets.

review/summary: anti mothball; pro mechanical
review/text: I grew up with rank-smelling mothballs, and now have a multiple cat household.  I wanted a more natural product.  I definitely have clothes moths, not the pantry version.  I had just peeled a new trap from its package, and a moth came out of hiding to circle around me.  The bait was easy to drop into the glue hut.  I find the traps with many moths in them.  The down side is keeping them in stock and replaced per instructions.  My moth population was way down within a week; not certain if this will bring it to zero.  Never the less, I prefer this slower method over the idea of a film from sprays and bombs everywhere I touch.

review/summary: No moth attraction at all
review/text: I've used a different brand of clothes moth traps before with great results. Unfortunately, this time I decided to try the Safer Clothes Moth traps. The lure is a pain to get out of the little pouch without getting it all over your hands (not a great idea unless you want moths flying at you). And even if you manage to get it into the trap without getting it on your hands, well, our moths are completely ignoring the traps as though there was no lure at all. What a waste.

I had already brushed, washed and dry-cleaned everything, dusting and vacuuming and removing the vacuum bag, and here these little guys still are.<br /><br />Maybe this will be a five star review when the traps are full...too soon to tell.

review/text: I have used these traps successfully in the past but recently they have not worked at all and I see the moths flying around with no interest in the traps.

I am baffled as to why the traps worked a few years ago but do nothing now.<br />I must have sexless moths.

review/summary: In my experience, they just don't work
review/text: I set up two of these traps in my closet about two months ago.  Since then, I have seen five clothing moths in the closet, yet the traps have not caught a single moth.  I am positive that the moths clothing moths, as I did a fair amount of research on them before buying the traps and am familiar with their appearance and behavior.  And it is unlikely that they were all female - females are more rarely seen than males, and even if they were equally common the odds would be long.  So the only conclusion I can come to is that these traps don't work very well.  Oh well.

review/text: I like the puffed nature of this chip that makes it more unique in the chip market.  I ordered the Salt and Vinegar and absolutely love that flavor, hands down my favorite chip ever.  I have tried the cheddar and regular flavors as well.  The cheddar is about a 4/5 and the regular is about a 3/5 because I prefer strong flavors and obviously that would not be the case for the regular.  The Salt and Vinegar is kind of weak compared to some regular S&V chips, but is quite flavorful and makes you wanting to come back for more.

review/summary: Awesome healthIER snack option!
review/text: I first had Popchips last week at a local deli in Miami. I was so impressed with them that I came online to find them (not even remembering the brand name) and I'm so happy that my favorite online retailer Amazon offers them. I don't necessarily want $20 worth of chips (LOL) but on the other hand, I love them so much that I do need that many so I can have half at home, and half at work (in different flavors). And I'm sure this price is much cheaper than buying them one by one at the deli I go to.<br /><br />I am a serious chip lover but am always looking for healthier alternatives. I love that these chips are low in calorie/fat but taste 10X better than baked chips. There's something about a need for salt n crunch that baked chips don't solve for me. I've found most of them to be bland, flat, weird, cracker-like. As soon as you put one of these chips in your mouth you'll realize that they're not lightweights at all. I love the salt/vinegar and was very surprised that they don't lack flavor or taste less salty/vinegar(y) than their high calorie counterparts. The crunch of the chip reminds me of a ligther alternative to a kettle chip or the General Mills chips, Bugle. I am such a fan, and now that I've found these chips on Amazon, I don't plan to buy any other kind.

review/summary: A lower calorie alternative to standard chips: 120 calories/oz. A bit flavorless in native state but good when flavored
review/text: The eternal dieter's quest: A replacement for oily, fatty, and oh-so-addictive real potato chips. Sure, you can get the baked versions, but they lack a bit in both the crunch and flavor categories. And they cost a lot.<br /><br />So the quest continues. I got a case of these PopChips, cheddar flavor, through Amazon, inspired by a good sale and thoughts of "there must be something better".<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the calorie count: A substantial 3oz bag of these chips (a lunch bag is 1oz) has only 360 calories (120 calories per "serving"), of which 35 are fat calories. Those are better numbers than tradition potato chips, which run around 160 calories for a 1oz serving, and which get 80-90 of those calories from fat. (Calorie counts can vary dramatically upward depending on the chips, but these numbers are typical). Better--and this is where the calories don't tell the whole story--a 1 oz serving feels larger, because these PopChips are puffed larger.<br /><br />But don't let that word "puff" scare you. They DO have a major non puffy tasting solid crunch to them. The flavor is also pretty good and the best part: Look Ma, no orange crap on my hands! That's a big plus for a cheddar flavored chip...Take that Cheetos!<br /><br />I liked the cheddar ones so much, I ordered the BBQ ones as well, and they're even better tasting (IMHO).<br /><br />One thing to note: These are low(er) fat, low(er) calories, but not low sodium. A 1oz portion has 290mg of sodium (12% of the recommended daily intake for a normal person). If you are on a salt restricted diet, or if you don't like salt, think twice...<br /><br />On the whole, these are good, tasty, and most importantly, satisfying, while at the same time less caloric (and much less fatty) than standard potato chips. They are saltier than many would prefer, but presuming you are not on a salt restricted diet, they'll be OK. As a bonus, they are supposed "all natural". Personally, I don't care about that last point, but it's certainly not a bad thing!<br /><br />One last thing: You will find some diets that claim it's not the calories, it's the source of the calories. Hogwash. It IS the calories. No chip is diet worthy in big quantities. Consider the calories and  your total caloric intake, and make the personal decision whether these make sense.<br /><br />Try them yourself...Amazon offers a sampler package with multiple varieties, and that might be the best way to sample them.

review/summary: Great Chips Less Fat
review/text: I eat chips almost every day and decided I wanted to find something that tastes as good but is lighter on unnecessary fat than regular types of chips. I bought a case of Popchips BBQ. These are satisfying and taste great. They don't taste exactly like any full fat chip products I've had mainly because they're not greasy at all, but they have a nice BBQ potato chip flavor. These are thick, crunchy, and light. I first bought the .8 oz bags and this serving size is on the small side for me with lunch (would probably be alright for a snack). 3 of the .8 oz bags works for me which of course bumps up the fat intake, but considering the same volume of "regular" chips has much more fat it is a significant fat decrease overall which is what I was looking for. I find the 3 ounce bags to be perfect. Even eating all 3 ounces works out to significantly less fat and calories than eating the same volume of other chips. This makes Popchips very satisfying to me, and I have bought many cases through Amazon.<br /><br />Heads up (mid-2011): Unfortunately the price has gone up significantly for these chips through Amazon, causing me to cancel my subscribe & save subscriptions. Popchips have popped up in local stores for significantly less per ounce. I love the convenience of the portioned bags and subscription but it's hard to justify paying double for the same product.<br /><br />The flavors are pretty straight forward but here's my thoughts...<br />Original flavor: Tastes like a plain potato chip minus the grease. Not my favorite flavor, but good for what it is. This flavor would probably be good with some kind of dip.<br />Chedder: Cheddar quickly became tied with BBQ for my favorite. Like BBQ the cheddar flavor is very strong. Great chips.<br />Salt & Pepper: Very strong pepper. To enjoy these you have to really like pepper. I like them, but they're not a favorite.<br />Sea Salt & Vinegar: I'm not a fan of vinegar, but strangely I enjoy this flavor. They're indeed salty with a fairly strong vinegar flavor.

review/summary: Best "healthy" salt and vinegar chip out there
review/text: I am always on the hunt for a good lower fat salt and vinegar chip and I have to say, it is a very hard thing to find! I actually wrote to Pringles once and asked if they had any plans to make a reduced fat salt and vinegar chip...to my disappointment, they said no. For whatever reason, the big label brands (Lays, Pringles, etc.) have not made a reduced fat or baked salt and vinegar chip. I have no idea why - salt and vinegar chip lovers are very devoted to their favorite flavor (as illustrated by me actually desperately writing to Pringles!). Anyway, I gave this brand a try and I am really happy with it. It has a nice strong flavor and a light crispy crunch. It have tried the Salt and Vinegar Pirate's Booty, which was ok, but more like a cheese puff and the flavor was a little strange. I have tried a couple baked salt and vinegar chips from small brands and they were all disgusting in flavor and texture. This is the only way to go that I have found so far. I would recommend it.<br /><br />Yes, I know, I appear to be obsessed with S&V chips...it is a little scary.

review/text: I love these salt and pepper flavored Popchips.  The bag size is perfect for a snack.  I love them in the afternoon when I get home from work, or at lunch with a sandwich.  Of course since they are "salt and pepper", there's a lot of salt.  I have to watch my sodium intake and it limits the number of bags I can eat.  Also, I would like to see the salt and pepper flavor included in the variety box instead of the vinegar, which I don't like at all.  Tastes too strong of vinegar.  Would be great for someone who absolutely loves vinegar.  It would also be nice if you could create your own variety box with the flavors you most prefer.  It does get a little boring eating 24 bags the same flavor.

The pepper flavor rounds up the chip rather than defines it, so it doesn't feel like you're eating pepper in it's raw form.<br /><br />It's a good thing the fat content is low because these are quite addictive.

review/text: I originally bought these chips because I'd heard great things about the company and their customer service, but I was a bit underwhelmed with the taste of the product.<br /><br />Pro:<br />- lower-calorie, baked-not-fried: this is definitely a huge plus!<br /><br />Con:<br />- I was expecting something more potato-ey. Instead of being made with potato bits or mashed-up potatoes,  it's mainly potato flour and starch. Therefore, the potato flavor is lackluster to non-existent. They're more of a delivery method for the flavoring than a tribute to the great potato.<br />- The salt and vinegar flavor wasn't as strong as I'd hoped, especially since more salt and vinegar wouldn't really increase the calorie count very much. Also, because the underlying "chip" was kind of bland, more flavor would have been beneficial.<br /><br />Overall - a great snack alternative to chips. I would recommend it for anyone who loves snacks with the texture of cheetos and those puffy rice crackers. If you're looking for something with potato flavor as well as salt and vinegar, you might want to look elsewhere.

review/summary: Great product, too bad I wasn't sent the correct kind.
review/text: These chips are excellent! They stopped carrying them at my local Costco, but I was so happy to find them here!<br /><br />I guess they ran out of the plain kind because it said they were available when I ordered them... they are listed on my order sheet and Amazon invoice as "Original"... and lo and behold, I received "Sea Salt and Vinegar", not "Original".<br /><br />Still a good product, but wish I had a courtesy e-mail or something to tell me they ran out of "Original". I'm not a huge fan of salt/vinegar chips, but at least it keeps me from eating them quickly (it lets me nibble).

That being the case, I have not found any better chip in my years of search that has such good taste and health considerations.  I offer them to people who eat the heavy saturated chips, and they love the Popchips.

review/text: I first sampled these chips at a volleyball tournament in California.  I'm a big chip lover, and these are by far the best chips I've ever had.  Better than the baked; not greasy at all, sturdy for dips.  I highly recommend these chips to any chip lover!

review/text: I love Salt & Vinegar chips and once I went on my diet I felt like I had to give them up because it's so hard to find healthy ones.  Then I finally found these and I love them!  They're strong tasting and I actually like them better than regular salt & vinegar chips.  They're less oily and I don't feel sick or guilty after having some.  The one-ounce bags are perfect for a snack, but the 3.25 ounce bags end up being cheaper so I divide it up into 3 ziplock bags once I open them.  It works great!

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, "potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best.

review/text: Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to "Pringles".  If you have ever eaten "Funyuns" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try "Grandma Utz" potato chips, a true potato chip.

review/summary: Delicious and a little bit nutritious....
review/text: Not greasy or salty like a traditional chip, these actually tend to be more satiating as a sweet snack than a salty one, at least in the sweet potato chip variety. A handful of these is a sufficient pick me up and relatively wholesome, with just around 100 calories. The sugars are low too so even though you feel like you are having something slightly sweet it's really not going to spike your sugars (I think around 3g per serving). Overall these are a great little snack that you can feel good about eating.

review/text: I've tried most of the Popchips flavors, and the barbecue flavor is my favorite. It has a sweet spiciness, but nothing is overpowering; just the right balance of smoke, sweet, and spice, they're all good, but the barbecue has the most robust flavor.<br /><br />Popchips are a good choice for those who are trying to trim a few pounds. They're tasty and filling, but relatively low in calories compared to traditional chips. I parcel mine out into sandwich-size reclosable bags to help with portion control, and still manage to have a satisfying snack that fits in my program.

review/summary: Best Popcorn-type Chips of 6 Brands I Bought & Tested!
review/text: I wanted to have "sized" portions of chip-type product that would be tasty and filling.  I tried at least 6 different brands of popcorn-type snack packages (unfortunately, most came in 24-36 item packages).  After receiving the first 5 brands, I felt they were total waste of money.... 2 had texture of light styrofoam peanuts, with almost no flavor.  A couple others had reasonably nice flavor, BUT only had a couple small handfuls of popcorn in each bag so way overpriced and I definitely did not feel satisfied after 1 bag.<br /><br />Then I received the variety pack of PopChips.  I first tried the barbeque, which turned out to be my favorite.  They have nice strong bbq flavor, nice texture, and each bag has enough to feel satisfying.  The Original and Sour Cream and Onion came in lower second, but most of the others were just ok to fair- (not worth eating for my tastes but interesting).<br /><br />Best of all, the nutrition counts are good, with each bag only having 100 cals, 3 grams fat and 15g carbs (0 Cholesterol).<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product (and above flavors) over all the other popcorn types I tried.<br /><br />P.S.  PopCorners White Cheddar brand came in SECOND.  Nice crunchy texture and pleasant cheddar flavor

review/summary: Pop Chips Barbeque Potato Chips
review/text: My local store was running a special on these, so I decided to give them a try.  They were ok, but I don't think I'd be getting them again if faced with the choice between these and another brand.  A good flavor was quickly followed up by a bad after-taste.<br /><br />The barbecue on this was the sweet smoky type of barbecue.  And it was good, a very addicting flavor.  The problem was the aftertaste that started a few seconds after the barbecue flavor melted away.  To me it tasted of straight rice flour, which is a very acquired taste and one that I've never been able to acquire.  It didn't help that these chips had the texture of Styrofoam either.  Between that and the rice flour taste I just couldn't enjoy them fully.<br /><br />The ingredients, however, are very good in this chip.  They're made of potato, use sunflower and safflower oils and the seasoning even has everything I can pronounce.  Although I am always suspicious when the designation "spices" is used without spelling out what those spices are.  And there was some rice flour in the mix which explains the aftertaste, but it was the last ingredient in the listing, meaning there shouldn't have been too much.  But I could still taste it.<br /><br />.8 oz is 100 calories for these chips, and it's a fair serving of the chips.  Enough for a small snack.  The bag boasts that they are all natural, and they are gluten free.  And there's no preservatives.  Sodium is about 7% of the daily value, which isn't outrageously high either.  All in all, they aren't extremely great for a person on a diet, but they aren't the worst thing you can eat, especially if you want a bag of chips.<br /><br />Maybe with a different flavor if they eliminated the rice flour I could bring myself to eat these again.  But since for now it's still there, I'll be steering clear.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2012
