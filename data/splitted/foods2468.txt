review/summary: my cats seems to like it
review/text: My vet said this was good food. I like how real chicken is the first ingredient. I want to feed my cats good food, but I can't afford the really expensive brands. The 18 lb bag for $24 is a pretty good deal if you do the math. My cats both eat it and seem to like it. I'd buy it again.

review/summary: Made my cat not grow hair
review/text: I had bought two big bags thinking this was the right product but toward the end of the last bag, I noticed areas or patches where hair was either not growing or falling out. I switched brands to a well-known brand and within a few weeks his hair started to grow again. Whew!!  Trust me, this isn't scientific analysis but it sure comes close to what caused his hair situation.

review/summary: Terrible Ingredient, Again--Don't Buy!
review/text: I wrote a review just yesterday regarding Diamond's so-called Natural "Lite" Lamb and Rice Dog Food.  I was shocked to read that "powdered cellulose" was one of the top ingredients.  Well, guess what?  "Powdered cellulose" is in this "natural" cat product, as well.  Why would any caring cat owner feed his or her beloved pet powdered cellulose?  I guess Diamond has to use some kind of filler, in order to reduce the amount of "real" food.  Powdered cellulose is certainly cheaper than chicken; and, after all, it's all about the money.  Moreover, the 18 lb. bag arrived in a cardboard box that looked as if it had been dropped from an aircraft, AND the bag itself was split!  Approximately a pound of food was loose and leaking from the box.  Shame on Diamond for its awful ingredient and on Amazon for its crummy packaging and shipping.  I'm stuck with a split bag of awful food and the bill for it, as well.  Don't make the same mistake as I did.

review/summary: My favorite Tea Masala
review/text: I love this stuff.  Love love love.  So often tea masala leaves you with Chai that tastes like pumpkin pie. Bland and uninteresting.  I love this - it makes a very spicy peppery Chai.  My cheater's chai trick: I take sweetened condensed milk and mix 1 tbsp of this kind of tea masala and mix it in, then put it in the fridge overnight.  The spices infuse the milk and sugar overnight, so you don't have to cook your tea in the morning; I can just brew up regular black tea and stir a big spoonful of this into it to make a nice cup of chai.  Add more milk or more sugar to taste, or when you're making the mix you can add more or less masala to your sweetened condensed milk, to adjust the spiciness.

review/summary: A good "backup" containment system
review/text: I set this up around the area where my back gate opens.  Sometimes meter readers or other repairmen might leave the gate open, and just in case they did, the above ground fence was extra security.<br /><br />There is a downside to it.  It's not very attractive, and depending on how you lay it out, you might have to constantly step over the two wires yourself.<br /><br />I don't think anyone should rely on this as their only way of keeping a pet enclosed, but it does provide a good back up system.  I started using mine when my dog was still a puppy.  Unlike wireless systems, where the dog must wear a special collar and must be put through a training process, virutally no training is required here.  The first time the dog comes in contact with the wire, he or she will get shocked and won't go near it again.  My dog never even considers jumping over it, even though he easily could.<br /><br />There are some other drawbacks.  The very thin aluminum wires tend to break over time, and if the ground wire breaks off, the light will continue to blink, but the fence will not produce a shock.  I recommend you buy a spool of additional aluminum wire because you will need to replace the wire over time.<br /><br />By the way, the "shock" is not all that mild!  I recommend you find some unsuspecting soul to touch it to see if its working properly.

review/summary: Great Kit
review/text: I bought this package when I extended my fence. I cannot comment on the posts that are included within the kit because I was using wooden fence posts with plastic extenders to hold the wire. I use the hot wire to contain my four dogs and it works perfectly. I previously had a higher model number from the same company, but the power was too much for the dogs...it was designed for livestock. This kit provides the right amount of power to contain my dogs that range from 30-100 pounds. Even when they touched it (when it was first installed), they did not scream like they did with my first power unit. This kit provides the enough juice to get the point across to the dogs without the guilt of hurting them.

We bought extra wire <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK0334">Baygard Electric Fence 14 Gauge Aluminum Wire - 164 Feet #00533</a>and insulators<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BO0Y1K">Zareba Electric Fence Yellow Economy Round-Post Insulator - 25 Pack SF25RP</a>. We needed more posts so we used 1/4" diameter lengths of rebar with the extra insulators. After we had all the posts and wire installed and were ready to hook up and test the fence, we discovered this in the AC power unit instructions: FOR INDOOR USE ONLY. This unit is attached to the bare wire that delivers the shock, so it's impossible to keep it indoors. This product is obviously intended to be used OUTDOORS. My husband built a wooden, water-tight box to contain it. It's plugged into an outdoor GFI (ground frequency interruptor) outlet. If it bothers you to have to build or buy a watertight box to use a fence intended but not constructed or insulated for outdoor use, do not buy this product. We are using a double wire, 6 inches and 18 inches off the ground, to keep raccoons from stealing all our corn from our garden, and it's working.

review/summary: It works, but it's a pain to set up!
review/text: I found this product very difficult and annoying to install. The included length of aluminum wire is quite stiff, which makes threading the PVC pipes annoying. Far more disturbing is the amount of aluminum that transferred from the wire to my hands during the installation.<br /><br />At first I thought this wasn't working - I'd left the Havahart live trap out and baited even after installing the fence as an added security measure, but when I released the groundhog I'd caught into the yard and it ran through the fence (brushing solidly against the wire) it didn't look like it was affected. Suspicious, I touched the wire... it produced barely a tingle. I checked the light, and sure enough - it was blinking merrily (the manual says that blinking is an indication of proper working order).<br /><br />So I began thumbing through the manual and came to the page talking about the two-wire design for operating in areas with dry ground. Unfortunately, that design won't work on groundhogs because they slink along the ground (the animal would have to touch both wires), so that was a bust. I decided to check the ground rod to see if the ground here is simply too dry and found the rod nice and moist from our deep clay soil. Giving up in disgust, I went inside to post a one-star-in-lieu-of-zero review when I had a revelation - groundhogs don't wear thick, rubber-soled shoes.<br /><br />Works well enough once you take your shoes off, but it gets only three stars because of the annoying setup.

review/summary: Simple, inexpensive, and effective.
review/text: Needed something to stop the dog from digging under an existing wooden fence, picked this up as neighbors and friends have suggested an electric fence as the only solution that worked for them. I do not see how this would work as a standalone fence as animals can run or jump over it without getting a shock. But for my use it's perfect. Easy to install and not too heavy on the wallet.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews, I wonder how many people read the instructions. The posts have holes for the cotter pins, not for the wire. YOU DO NOT NEED TO THREAD THE WIRE THROUGH EACH POST!!! Simply pound the posts in, unroll the wire (yes, this is challenging - they should have used a spool to make unrolling a bit less cumbersome), slide the wire between the flats of the pin out to the eye, put pin into desired hole in post, and expand the cotter pin "flaps" in opposite directions, repeat at each post. I also picked up some 6 inch standoff poly insulators that nailed to my existing fence to add tension at the ends and corners (cost me another 5-10 bucks).<br /><br />The fence can also be run as a dual wire setup, so poorly grounded soil can be overcome. Top wire is live, bottom wire is part of the ground. If an animal contacts both wires, they complete the circuit and get a shock. I'm sure it's not nearly as effective, but it is an option if you can't get a good ground any other way. Luckily for me, we don't have dry soil here in Western Oregon.

review/summary: Finally, al solution!
review/text: This product does exactly what we hoped it would do: keep our (eight) dogs out of the boxwood beds next to the house. For some reason, they loved to play in those bushes, and the landscape was suffering.We installed it in an hour or so. It's a moderate surprise when the dogs come in contact with the wire, but enough that they never do so again!

review/summary: worked off and on; also not same poles as in video on product page
review/text: I got this fence because I worried the one I got from my dad was to powerful around my pets and kids...I went through putting this one up and it worked for a little bit but the same day we put it up I bumped into it and no zap..so my husband check it out  and tightened some things and it worked he touched it and said it felt about like a 9volt battery as he was telling me he showed me again and he said it did not work..this went on for several minutes...also the poles are pretty flimsy pvc pipes not the ones it showed in the videos along with the product showing how to put it up...(which is why I picked this one)I gave it 2 stars because it looked a lot nicer than my previous fence that I now have to put back up after going to the store because I cut the wire in several places to put the new fence up.

review/summary: Could be better
review/text: The basic concept is there but someone cut too many corners trying to save a buck.  The plastic stakes should be replaced with simple tent stakes so they could be hammered into hard ground more easily.  These have blunt bottoms.  Why?  It is very hard to hammer these into anything but soft sand.  Also, the wire is a ball of wire instead of a rolling spool. This was a real pain in the ass trying to untangle the ball of wire they give you.  And putting the wire through a tiny hole in the stake?  How about a small spur on each stake that the wire could simply be looped around once to secure it rather than having to thread each one like a needle.  Once it was up it worked and then it didn't.  Probably my fault as if any part of the wire grounds it won't work.  But with the cheap wire and stakes it's hard to get a sturdy run that doesn't touch something.  When it does work it gives a nice shock but the only way to test it is to either zap yourself (or one of your kids) or buy a cheap lamp tester ($8.00)  Again, should be included with this product.  For the money this chould be a lot more user friendly.

review/summary: Glad I read your reviews! This is a terrific product!
review/text: I have 3 large dogs and purchased a home that was professionally landscaped for a television show.  They went all out, and did a great job- then we moved in and I needed a way to keep my pets from getting into the flower beds.  I purchased one fence kit initially and it worked so well I purchased a second for another segment of yard that was too far apart to piggyback on the first fence.  My dogs don't even need the fence on anymore- getting zapped once did it for them.  Its a bit tedious for weed eating and mowing, but worth it in that the landscaping is intact and I can stop worrying about them digging up the sprinklers underground.<br />This fence surrounds backyard plant beds and does a great job- my largest dog is a mastiff and it works to deter him too- give it a shot!

review/summary: Things that would have been good to know
review/text: I bought this to try and deal with some unruly neighbor's cats that love to come on my back porch and window battle with my cat.  They have ruined my screen door with their fighting.  I thought I would set this up around the perimeter of the porch to keep them away from the back door and also give my cat some peace of mind.  What the description doesn't tell you is that the fence cannot work unless the animal has contact with the ground and the wire and that it won't conduct through concrete nor can it have any brush in contact with it.  Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.  Also, only one wire will be electrified and the animal has to be in contact with it and the ground in order to get a the shock so I imagine that a cat would automatically just jump over it.  I guess I'll never be able to test that theory.  Was very disappointed that I had to return it without even giving it a try.

review/summary: Acceptable for the price
review/text: We needed some way to train our very large dog to stay away from our neighbor's chain link fence, so she would not climb over, and to keep her out of our vegetable garden. Someone suggested this kind of above ground electric fence.<br />After looking around on the Internet and searching unsuccessfully for a place where we could buy the supplies locally, I ordered this kit from Amazon. As usual, the service from Amazon was great, and the price was good.<br />The kit is easy to install, although 100 feet of wire is not really that much. We were able to buy additional wire at a local hardward store. The support poles are a little flimsy. and also a little too short for a part of our area. We ended up supplementing them with a few pieces of 1/2" PVC pipe, so in order to get everything we needed, we ended up spending close to $100.<br />The wire has done its job, though. So far the dog has been too suspicious of it to go near it.

review/summary: Benefit of the doubt is the only way this gets 2 stars.
review/text: Hooked up this electric fence around my garbage cans that something keeps knocking over.  Figured an electrified, bare 120v AC wire would do the job quicker, but I didn't want a bunch of charred critters laying outside.  Using this electric fence, I am absolutely certain that I won't have any charred critters around...even if they took a nap on the wire.<br /><br />The system is pretty easy to setup; it would have been nicer if it would have came with a bit more rebar for each of the plastic fence posts, as they're kind of flimsy and you're just supposed to bury them a couple inches deep.  It's really not very secure to begin with.  Alas I hooked the thing up in a big box around 2 trash cans and a recycle bin.  Nice tight, tense wire was almost invisible unless you were looking for it, and hooked up to the power box, which was hooked up to the ground...plugged it in, and the light started flashing.  BINGO!  Next time something comes to knock over a trash can, *ZAP!*<br /><br />Not so much.<br /><br />Like any man would, I figured I should test it out.  I didn't feel a thing.  Absolutely nothing.  I could have snorted half the wire up my nose and hacked it out of my mouth and not been any worse for the wear.  I checked to make sure nothing was touching to short/ground out - everything was tense, straight, the ground was hooked up correctly...and...maybe I just have remarkably thick skin, I thought to myself.<br /><br />I went to bed able to see the obnoxious flashing light telling me that my trash can was protected.  I woke up to a knocked over trash can, with one of the bags dragged over the wires, bending it quite a bit, and leaving the wires resting nicely on the cold, moist ground.<br /><br />And now the thing never flashes.<br /><br />It certainly didn't work for me.  Re-stringing the wire doesn't work, the fuses aren't burned out, all the connections are fine, it just doesn't work.  If it DID work, I think it'd be a pretty nice little fence based on the easy of installation and price.  Wouldn't recommend...unless wherever you buy it has a generous return policy, just in case.

review/summary: Pretty simple concept
review/text: This is not high tech or heavy duty, but it was easy to set up, it does what it needs to. There were some green pvc pipes, wire, a grounding pole and fastener and the elctrical box oh and some pins that the wire gets secured to the poles with.  You need to mount the electrical box in a protected spot, ideally in a waterproof or weatherproof box.  I made a little stand that was open on the sides and put it beneath the eave of the house.  Our yard is fenced in on three sides, but in the front of the yard we needed to be creative to keep our dogs from running to the street.  They aren't in the yard unsupervised and 9 out of 10 times they never even think to leave the yard, but I would hate for them to approach someone that doesn't like dogs and a problem ensues.  We have three dogs and we like to play fetch and generally play with them and exercise them in the yard.  The dogs seem to be able to tell when the fence is electrified.  We only plug it in when we have the dogs out.  As soon as the fence is on the dogs don't go anywhere near it.<br /><br />There is an instruction book in the box, we did test the fence, because the first time we thought we had it hooked it up right - we didn't.  That was because my super fabulous handyman said instructions were for dorks.  I guess I'm a dork.  Because when he set them up, I could hold the fence and feel, well nothing but a wire.  When I set up the fence he grabbed it and he felt something more than a wire.<br /><br />Our dogs aren't gigantic either - I have a standard schnauzer, a miniature schnauzer/westie mix, and a beagle/blue heeler mix. The only dog who has touched the fence yet is our cat Queso (he thinks he's a dog).  He was frightened.

review/summary: A pain on rocky soil, ugly and cheap
review/text: So here in southern TN we have this horrid red dirt called "chirt" it makes any digging a nightmare.  This would not have been an issue with this fence if it had come with metal or even sturdy poles.  But because the cheap plastic poles would break if I attempted to push them into the ground, there was a lot of digging involved.  When I was finished I was rewarded with an ugly appearance around my garden (the plan was to keep the feral cats from using it as a litter box) Then I discovered that I had to find a place to shelter the box as it cannot get wet.  Well my garden isn't next to the house so that doesn't make it all that easy.  Add to it the fact that this ugly thing only stops animals at a specific height who touch both the ground and the wire at the same time, and the stupid cats are just jumping over the ugly thing.<br /><br />Needless to say it has been removed as it is both ugly and serves no purpose.  I'm sure that there are people who this would serve an excellent purpose for.  I am not one of those people

review/summary: Wasn't that difficult to install and keeps the rabbits out of our garden
review/text: I'm pretty happy with this fence. It's your basic above-ground electric fence, nothing fancy at all, but fine for what I need it for. I had expected it to be difficult to install, but it really wasn't that bad. I had to wrestle to get the wires threaded through the post as it is a little stiff, but nothing like I expected. I used a large pair of pliers to maneuver it through and it wasn't bad with those, so I suggest you use pliers too. I'm using this to keep rabbits out of our garden. I have a family of them that eats my tomatoes and while rabbits are cute, they're unwanted in my garden. I put it very low to the ground and just keep the grass cut, so it doesn't get grounded and not work properly. I've been using the fence like this for 3 weeks and have seen no signs of the rabbits since I installed it. Only time will tell if it keeps working, but as of right now, it works great for my needs. I'll update my review if anything changes.

review/summary: Useless near flower beds or gardens.
review/text: Boy I wished this thing really worked like a real electric fence. It is useless in trying to keep pets and no-seeums from my flower beds. Even my small garden can not be protected. If you have any type of foliage near this thing then forget it. You need pure open unobstructed space for it to be effective. Then of course it does not really put out enough volts to deter most critters anyway.<br /><br />The design is so cheap it is unreal. Little plastic flimsy poles for support that fall over continuously. If it rains, they are down quick and then you have to fully protect the power supply from rain and humidity. It is more like a quick remedy that is dispose able till you can get the real thing.<br /><br />The height of the wire from ground has to match your critter height. Since the critter has to literally grab the wire and ground at same time to work. My pets just jump over it. Other no-seeums are going under it.

review/summary: okay for small animals
review/text: In fairness, the description does say for Pets and Small animals. I was hoping that my very large, stubborn Cane Corso Mastiff would feel the buzz and back off from running away. He just plowed through the fence like he was a bulldozer and didn't even blink or look back. But then again, when we rescued him from the pound he had a 9" long ratchet wrench in his gut that he ate. I guess he is impervious to physical pain. But, he will back off when I wave the kids butterfly net in his face.<br /><br />I'll try to salvage the fence poles and use it around the garden to keep the feral cats from digging. But it just seems like a lot of work because the feet have to be grounded and the body touching the wire. I'm sure the squirrels will still be getting my peaches.

This makes mowing a lot more difficult. While it does work at keeping my dog inside the boundaries I don't think I'd get this again.

review/summary: Not Terrible, Not Wonderful
review/text: Recently, when I went from blonde to brown and back to blonde, I noticed that my hair was having a more difficult time getting back to "normal" like it normally does when I do the hair chameleon routine. Enter Split Remedy Leave in Conditioning Spray. I purchased this and the serum in hopes that they would be the quickest way to deliver the "remedy" to my hair. I immediately put this on my dry hair and combed it through. It felt okay while it was still wet, so I thought everything was fine. After it dried, however, I noticed my hair felt like straw. Even my hair without and product in it and despite the damage done to it, doesn't feel like straw. I did notice though that my split ends seemed a bit better and my hair didn't look like straw so that was a plus. Then I decided to try it while my hair was still damp from the shower, and the straw effect was less, and the ends looked better than they did without the product. All in all, I give this three stars because it did what it claimed to do in only one use, but I can't stand my hair feeling like straw which I why I bought a conditioning spray in the first place. If you want your ends to look better and don't mind your hair feeling like straw, then this is a good choice for you! Otherwise, don't bother. Try the serum instead!

I never thought there would be anything else that I could like as well as coffee.  But Teeccino has proved to be a great substitute. When I'm going to be doing something strenuous like hiking or biking, I add a measure of regular coffee for a little caffeine boost.  It also works perfectly for the latte that I usually make every morning with an electric frother. Since it's made to be brewed, you can make it as strong as you like.  It's rich and delicious and leaves no aftertaste.  The flavored ones, such as the chocolate mint, are delicious as a nighttime drink with no danger of that 3 percent caffeine keeping you awake and also blend well with steamed milk or cream.  Iced Teeccino in hot weather is also another option.

review/text: This gum is the best gum I have ever had! The gum itself starts out with a burst of flavor from the liquid on the inside, and is a very sweet and tangy flavor. It comes in a unique box, and is definitely the most interesting gum I have ever seen. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: like fine take out for cats!
review/text: I have a raw fed 9 month old kitty but every now and then for a treat I give him a little of the Tiki Cat brand cat food. One reason I make the exception for this brand because when you open the can, you can identify what it is your cat is actually eating. No "mystery meat", no paying for or having him ingest sketchy fillers - no questioning "what *EXACTLY* is a BY PRODUCT !?! - *shudder*......"<br /><br />This Mackerel and Sardine flavor is one of his favorites. Inside the can you'll find what looks like a tiny restaurant takeout container for kitties - layered nicely, chunks of real seafood, looks and smells good!  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Excellent cat food
review/text: I first got this cat food because my cat has a skin allergy and the vet told me not to feed him any poultry or meat.  This food is great because it has only seafood for the protein source and no meat byproducts.  As an added bonus, my cats absolutely love this food!  I bought a couple other kinds of TikiCat food and they love those too :)

review/summary: The firmest sardines...
review/text: Majority of the cans are lined in plastic and leach Bisphenol-A which has been linked to cancer, birth defects, miscarriages, obesity, and insulin resistance, which can lead to Type II diabetes. Refer to the Environmental Working Group report on BPA for more information. "La Sirena" claims that all of their products, the cans are free of BPA or Bisphenol-A.<br /><br />I consume many different type of fish all the time. LA SIRENA sardines are the firmest sardine of all. All other brand sardines in tomato except LA SIRENA are soft and mushy. LA SIRENA in 15 oz cans are extremely reasonably priced sardines. You get the sardines intact and although ready to be consumed it seems like it needs to be cooked some more since it is so firm. Regardless of the type of fish, each can has some 1000~3000 MG of sodium which is not low so I drain the oil since vegetable oil is unhealthy, regardless of the type specified, and never trust when they claim olive oil either, as well as the tomato juice or water, to get ride of the unhealthy part of the can including the unhealthy salt and then consume the fish.

review/summary: La Sirena Sardine 15.0 Oz (tomato sauce)
review/text: I like sardines but don't eat them very often...maybe a 15 oz can every year, reason why I gave La Sirena 4 stars instead of 5 because there may be better sardines. Having said that, I am planning of storing food for at least 6 months and sardines seem to be an excellent choice just in case the world goes down the drain (or worst yet, a zombie apocalypse...just kidding).<br /><br />I agree with the other comment about the sardines being firm, I don't think they require extra cooking though, I like them the way they come...that's my taste. But then again, I don't know anything about sardines.<br /><br />La Sirena sardines (15 oz can) provides you with 7 servings:<br />protein: 12g, carbs: 2g, fat: 3g (approx.), and 250mg of sodium.  So the total is:<br />Protein 84g, carbs 14g, fat 21g, and sodium 1750mg. You'll find that the sodium and carbs are in the tomato sauce, so you just can eat the sardines if you cant have the sodium.<br /><br />Personally, I don't care about the high sodium content. In fact, if the world goes down the pipe I'll need anything I can get my hands on. For instance, I can mix the tomato sauce with olive oil and garlic to mix it with pasta. I know, I know, this is not gourmet eating, but when surving is the top priority you will eat what you must.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Absolutely!!!<br /><br />BTW it's supposed to be hot...it is not

review/summary: The Real Deal
review/text: This coffee is really good.  I was hesitant about writing a review, but I have been through several types and brands of coffee on Amazon, other mail order sites, and local grocery stores offerings without anything that matched this coffee.  That along with having let several people try this coffee and everyone that has ever tried it goes on about how good it is prompted me to put in my 2 cents in on a review.<br /><br />The taste is full bodied without the bitter bite.  This coffee reminds me of the type of coffee you get and the end of a high dollar meal.  It has a richness of taste that comes thru unlike an over the counter type franchised coffee.<br /><br />I use this coffee at home with a drip coffee maker with screen only type filter and get great results.  I also use this coffee at the office with a French Press and get incredible results.  At the office, even the "coffee snobs" agree this is really good coffee and end up buying it for themselves.<br /><br />Personal tastes differ, but I think it would be hard to go wrong with this coffee.  The regular roast of this coffee seems a shade darker than other regular roasts and the beans arrive with that oily texture/sheen you would expect with a fresh quality coffee.

review/summary: Finally a coffee that we really like..
review/text: In my efforts to find a coffee that my husband and I really like, I think we have tried half the coffees on Amazon!<br />This is finally one that we both like and will stick with.  It isn't too strong, but it has a lot of flavor.  Just right for us.<br />Let me say that neither of us like a dark roast, so for those who do, this will not be a good coffee.  Try the other Altura coffees.  My son-in-law gets both the Sumatra and the Dark Roast, and loves them both.  I had ordered one of them, and liked the flavor, but it was too dark for us.  Based on that, I should have known earlier that Altura regular roast would be the one for me.  But no, I had to learn by my own mistakes!<br />I will try to give you a list of what we tried, and what we thought of each.<br /><br />Coffee Bean Direct Yirgacheffe.  I like Yirgacheffe coffee, but this one was hard to swallow.  It wasn't a pleasant taste at all, and it was a 5 pound bag!  After using about 3 pounds, we just couldn't drink it any more.  I had frozen the beans, and now add just a few at a time to our morning coffee, as I'm too cheap to throw them away.<br /><br />Jeremiah's Pick Organic Breakfast Blend. A little bit stronger than we wanted, and it didn't taste fresh.<br /><br />Cameron's Gold Organic.  We really liked the first bag, but the next few were stale, so cancelled the subscription.<br /><br />Lavazza Gran Filtro.  Nope!  Stale and not flavorful.<br /><br />Jacobs Kroenung Aroma-Bohnen.  Not much flavor, and also stale.<br /><br />Weavers Organic Blend with Sweet Caramel finish.  This is supposed to be one of the top-rated coffees, but it left a strange aftertaste, and we struggled to finish it.<br /><br />Equal Exchange Organic Coffee.  A little too strong for us, though it was supposed to be a medium roast.  Neither of us enjoyed the flavor.<br /><br />I often tried a coffee after carefully reading the reviews and have come to realize that what we like is very subjective.  But stale coffee is never acceptable no matter what your taste may be.

review/summary: NO BITTERNESS COFFEE, MEDIUM ROAST
review/text: I like this coffee because it doesn't have a bitter aftertaste.  But, I don't think I'll buy it again because I want a light roast and Altura doesn't sell any, I guess.  I heard on Dr. Oz that light-roasted is healthiest, having more flavanols, phyto-nutrients and such.<br /><br />Also: Organic light roast java is rich in theobromine and theophylline. These nutraceutical agents are vasodilators. That means they relax the blood vessels, resulting in better circulation.

It is uniformly full-bodied, silky and has the best "coffee" taste...almost nutty.  Absolutely no bitterness.<br /><br />I used 1 heaping tablespoon per 6 oz serving along with spring water in my Presto 12 cup percolator. Also used a 'coarse' grind from my cheap-o Mr Coffee grinder (which does an excellent job for being a blade thingy).<br /><br />Just a great coffee!

review/text: I typically drink my coffee with milk and a bit on the sugary side; I had this coffee today straight up black with no milk because I forgot to buy one yesterday and I added a teaspoonful of sugar.  I thought it was going to taste bitter and unfavorable but the aromatic smell tickled my nose and the nutty taste was surprisingly addictive!  I think I found a favorite coffee.

review/summary: It has a nice nose (Certainly not "sawdust", whoever said that!)
review/text: Yes, the "sawdust" thing is N-V-T-S, NUTS! This is good coffee with a pretty full taste in addition to the good nose. The nose has absolutely no notes of non-arabica coffee like Rhymes-With-Smafeway O-Organics (and not Fair-Trade, either). I am comparing this also to Yuban, which if you make a latte type drink with is actually excellent. Yuban is, however, not Fair-Trade coffee, and the organic version--when you can even find it, which is almost never--is not as good sometimes. Don't know why, and it wouldn't be Fair-Trade like Cafe Altura, anyway. So I'm happy. What I suspect is that what I'd want to do is to mix this half and half with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KSRTM4">Cafe Altura Organic Coffee, Colombian Dark, Whole Bean, 32-Ounce Bag</a> (4.5 Stars, 27 Reviews). I think that would be even better for me. Not sure because I haven't tried it yet, but plan to try very soon. Enjoy!

review/summary: 3mo later and your winner is....CAFE ALTURA!
review/text: I've tried just about every regular/city/urban roast on Amazon and a few sought after local roasters as well (the coffee holy land - Seattle)... after all is said and done, Cafe Altura stands out for taste, smell, freshness, how the beans are grown, and amazing value. This roast easily compares to the beans roasted locally that go for 4x more. Keep in mind I'm running this through an espresso machine with a Breville Smart grinder and also using it for a drip machine at work. If you're looking for a dark roast, you may want to try their Peruvian as it seems people have taken to liking that for their press and drips.<br /><br />For $22 (for an order of 1) it's an amazing value, the fact that it's organic is an added bonus! Although with super saver shipping it takes maybe a week to get in... IF you go with subscribe you'll not only get it for under $20, it'll be shipped to you in express(you should try it first with a single order of course, but I'm sure you'll find this roast extremely satisfying even for the coffee snobs). They use Ontrac for the west coast, which is an overnight service. Not sure how they ship out to the central, midwest, and east coast but I'm sure you'll get it in a matter of days.<br /><br />Take it for someone who hasn't used the same roast twice for the past 3 months, try this first and go from there. I will tell you, this is one of the best tasting roast I've had and a steal for the price.

review/summary: Sawdust in my grind? Yuk!
review/text: I tried Cafe Altura a while ago and thought it was good.  So I ordered a 32-ounce bag. When I ground some of the beans with my grinder set on "fine," it produced coffee mixed with a lot of flakes of something that looks like sawdust. I cleaned my grinder (although there was no reason I would have had sawdust in my coffee grinder) and tried again.  Same thing. I ground other beans.  No sawdust.  I tried a third time.  Sawdust.<br /><br />Whatever it is - it looks like flakes of wood and will not grind up like the coffee. I brewed a pot (even though I felt it was questionable to drink sawdust brewed with my coffee.)  The coffee is very bad with an nasty astringent flavor. This is supposed to be "regular roast."  It tastes bitter and quite metallic.  It is not a "roasted" flavor as in French Roast either.  I am afraid to drink this coffee.  Sawdust is toxic, if that is what it is.  If is not sawdust, well then - the question is WHAT is it? Coffee bark? The entire bag of coffee is useless to me.<br /><br />At this point I will not buy this brand again. I am getting sick of the quality control problems regarding buying coffee here. Out of three brands I ordered only the Equal Exchange was ok. The other two brands I tried did not maintain consistent quality.  Camerons started out amazing and then slowly began to suck.  Altura just sold me tree bark or something.<br /><br />Update - Amazon refunded me for the coffee.  Cafe Altura so far has not replied to my email. So I will probably give Amazon another try!  But forget Cafe Altura.  I'm not giving them a try again unless I at least get a response...

review/summary: Its not bad, but it doesn't satisfy
review/text: I had the opportunity to digest a box of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, and the name of the product pretty much sums up whats in the box. To be honest, it is what it says it is, but not much more.  The product had a good crunch and the brown sugar flavoring tasted as it was.  But it struck me as sweet - maybe too sweet, to get the whole impact of the flavor.  Or, said another way, there wasn't any rich tones to what I was tasting, no nuances to the flavors. Would I buy it at the store?  Probably not.  The fiber content were higher, or maybe if they combined the brown sugar flavor with the cinnamon flavor there would be an encouragement to try it.  But as it stands, my month with the cereal wasn't one in which I looked forward to buying another box.  It was more like trying to get through the one I had.

review/text: I'm not an oatmeal fan, but I do like cereal so I was very interested in trying this one. The squares have a lightly sweet flavor. You can still taste the oats, though. It's not overpowered by the brown sugar at all. The texture is extremely crunchy and holds up well in milk. Each piece is small enough to be finger food for little ones and grab-able in handfuls for adults. I've been snacking on it dry as well as in a bowl with milk and find it really versatile. Breakfast, lunch, dinnertime, evening snack...this cereal is a healthful option for any of those.

review/text: I really enjoyed this cereal and needless to say, the box is almost empty after only about 5 days. It only has a slight oatmeal taste and I would say the brown sugar is more than just a hint but the combination is really delicious. It also does not get soggy right away. It stayed pretty crunchy for a while. Even to the last drop, there was still a little bit of crunch left.<br /><br />Also, what I love is that it's healthy and isn't loaded with sugar. In fact, if you're used to really sweet cereals, this may not be for you as while it has some sweetness to it, it isn't overly sweet.<br /><br />If you're looking for a healthy alternative to regular cereal, this is definitely worth a try.

It's got whole oak and wheat flower and brown and other sugar as well as aditives good and not so good. I'm still a hot oatmeal lover and this is not nearly as good.

review/text: Very tasty, stays crunchy in milk.  Also good enough for snacking.  I will definitely look for these in the grocery store.  Would love more of similar items to test.

review/summary: One of my Favorites!
review/text: Yum, oatmeal squares.  Okay, that does sound bland even to me, but Quaker makes a great cereal for any time.  It's crunchy even after sitting in my milk for a while (granted a little soggy outside but still nice and crisp inside) and the sweetness is not overwhelming.  I like these for breakfast or as a snack since they are good on their own or with milk.  Oatmeal Squares with a hint of brown sugar are just right in terms of flavor and crunch and one of my all time favorite cereals ever.

review/summary: A hint of sugar, but a few too many calories
review/text: This cereal is crunchy oatmeal/fiber squares, and really does have just a hint of sweetness to it. I don't like overly sweet cereals, or cereals in which the sugar dissolves into the milk, and in this case neither is true.<br /><br />The ingredient list is as follows: Whole oat flour, whole wheat flour, brown sugar, maltodextrin, malted barley extract, molasses, salt, calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, natural flavor, reduced iron, sodium ascorbate, yellow 5, niacinamide (vitamin B3), BHT (preservative), zinc oxide, vitamin E, acetate, vitamin A palmitate, yellow 6, thiamin mononitrate (vitamin B1), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamine B6), riboflavin (vitamin B2), and folic acid.<br /><br />One cup of cereal alone contains 210 calories; with half a cup of skin milk it is 250 calories. In comparison, wheaties contain 133 calories per cup of cereal alone, and Kashi Go Lean contains 140 calories. One cup of cereal also contains 5g of dietary fiber, and 6g of protein.<br /><br />Overall this is a tasty and healthy cereal, however it has a relatively high calorie count, and there are healthier alternatives available.

review/summary: OK, not great.
review/text: These were OK. They taste decent (though nothing like Oatmeal). But they are rock hard too. By the time you're done eating them, your jaw hurts from having to chew so much. Also, looking at the nutritional details, they aren't all that healthy either, despite the premise promoted. Overall, a decent cereal, but not exactly a healthy option, and they will require a lot of chewing.

review/summary: If Captain Crunch had an affair with Life cereal....
review/text: I like to eat Kashi Crunch and I was hoping this would be a slightly tastier alternative.  But when they says a "hint of brown sugar" they mean it!  These squares were not very exciting when it comes to flavor and I could barely register the brown sugar.  They are relatively filling though and with some fruit on top, they would make a good, quick breakfast for an adult getting ready to head out to work, with 4 hours until their lunch break.  But I don't feel it stands out much from other "healthy" cereals for adults.

review/text: I tried this at Costco and just loved it...until I read the ingredients.  Contains yellow #5 and #6.  Now why would Quaker destroy such a good idea by adding horrible food coloring?  Also contains maltodextrin, a product of corn.  I'm so mad because I love Quaker oatmeal.  Why can't they leave out the horrible coloring? :(

review/summary: Sweet and Crunchy
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal is a nice alternative to the typical "flake" cereal.  The squares stay generally crunchy and tasty covered by milk.  Very filling and just sweet enough (though I still like to add extra sugar).  Quaker had a Toasted Oatmeal cereal that I liked better but stopped making it several years ago.  This is a nice alternative.

review/summary: Very good
review/text: I am not a fan of brown sugar, but decided to give this a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The flavor is very good.  I could barely detect brown sugar and I really did not mind it.  Not in a sense that I had to tolerate the flavor, but that I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I liked that this cereal is not too sweet.  I tried it as a snack by itself and with milk, and liked it both ways.  However, my 4 year old son tried a piece and said he did not like it, I am guessing because it is not as sweet as his usual Honey Comb, Cheerios, and Trix stuff.<br /><br />Oh well, more for me.

review/summary: Reinforcing the posiitve we already knew about Quaker
review/text: Quaker Oats has been a staple in American business for the past century and is well known for a wide range of products, including Rice-a-Roni, granola bars Aunt Jemima Syrups, Gatorade and of course, Quaker Oatmeal.<br /><br />I don't personally eat a great deal of cereal and am not partial to Quaker's Life or Capt Crunch brands, but we must complement the company on its Oatmeal Squares product.  The squares are rather small and keep a good balance with milk - they do not become soggy in 60 seconds.  The brown sugar flavor is adult sensitive sweet and actually retain their flavor.  They could be included as a snack or as a light meal other than breakfast.  The amount needs to be watched as the calorie count can jump on one if not careful.<br /><br />It is refreshing to note that the classic companies continue to produce and quietly promote their quality products.<br /><br />Well done, Quaker Oats<br /><br />Dr. John Hogan  CHA CHE CMHS<br />HospitalityEducators<br />Hogan Hospitality

review/summary: Great finger food!!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal squares is one of my kids favorite cereals. It is also great finger food and frequently is a part of kids snack bags. We never had the Brown Sugar variety and I just recently tried it out with my family. Really low on sugar it still has a really great taste. But in fact, all four flavors, Brown Sugar, Cinnamon, Golden Maple and New Honey Nut Quaker� Oatmeal Squares, are heart healthy* and deliver 46 grams of whole grains (that's 96%** of your minimum daily recommendation of whole grains), 5 grams of dietary fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving.<br />I also shared Brown Sugar Oatmeal Squares with few friends<br />Smart mamas like the ingredients including the amount of iron in this cereal. They were happy to find out there is only 7 grams of sugar in each serving, but it is still sweet and doesn't taste like cardboard.<br />Few of my friends read the list of ingredients several times looking for something they are not happy with. No luck - all the ingredients seem authentic. Group verdict - APPROVED<br />SNACK BAGS<br />I make my own for the kids. They normally include<br />one or two types of cereal, dry fruit (cranberry or raisins are easy to deal with and cheap), plantain chips)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OVPK9G">Quaker Oatmeal Squares, Crunchy Oatmeal Cereal with a Hint of Brown Sugar, 14.5-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Taste is important!
review/text: Is there anyone left who doesn't know the benefits of Quaker cereals? If so, I'll mention that part in a minute, because the most important thing, at least in our family, is taste. If it doesn't taste good, we'll never purchase the product. Oatmeal Squares not only tasted good, but was different, which I found surprising. Whole grains and brown sugar were mentioned on the box, but if you take a look at the ingredients, there's malted barley extract and molasses too. This crunchy oatmeal cereal isn't overly sweet, which is another plus. Here are some of the highlights:<br /><br />* 46 grams of whole grains per serving<br />* The crunchiness holds up in milk<br />* Makes a great snack<br />* Low in saturated fat and cholesterol<br />* Certified by the American Heart Association<br />* 5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein<br /><br />The cereal fills you up and stays with you, important, if you have busy mornings. Also, it's not messy, meaning, the squares don't flake. Moms can easily put some in a baggy for kids to snack on while doing errands.

review/summary: Excellent Cereal
review/text: I personally prefer oats to wheat, so I was anxious to try this cereal.  I am happy to report that I really like it.  It tastes great!  It is just slightly sweet, but not too much.  It will work well for breakfast or for a snack right out of the box.  The cereal has a satisfying crunch too.<br /><br />One of the negative reviews noted that the cereal contains artificial coloring (Yellow 5 and Yellow 6).  I too am puzzled why Quaker would want to color the cereal, and that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I suppose some marketing genius didn't like the color.  But Quaker oatmeal doesn't have coloring, and people buy plenty of that.  I hope that in the future Quaker worries more about how its products taste and less about how they look.

review/summary: Brown Sugar How Come You Taste So Good?
review/text: Who orders cereal in the mail? apparently I do. This box came, and It felt like there was a box of rocks in my hand!<br /><br />Oatmeal Squares are tiny boxes of brown sugary-ness, and they are heavy in more weighs than one (Im Punny). They taste very much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003W07CN8">Golden Grahams Cereal, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 5)</a> BUT with a earthier, Hay like aftertaste. If that makes sense. about a 1/2 a cup would fill you right on up for the whole morning.<br /><br />I liked them well enough. Maybe would get them again in the future.

review/summary: yummy cereal!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares cereal with a hint of brown sugar is quite yummy. It's not bland, yet it's not too sweet either since it contains a hint of brown sugar. The taste kind of reminded me of Golden Grahams cereal. The cereal provides the right texture since it is crunchy and holds up in milk. The outside gets a little soggy after soaking in the milk for awhile, however the inside is still crunchy. The cereal is good too right out of the box as a snack, no milk needed.<br /><br />I also love how it is a healthy cereal as well. The box claims it provides 46 grams of whole grains per serving. There is 210 calories a serving, 9 grams of sugar, 0.5 grams of saturated fat, 190 mg of sodium, and 5 grams of fiber (19% daily value). Plus it's enriched with all those needed vitamins and minerals. Overall, it's an excellent choice for a healthy breakfast or as a go to snack.

review/summary: Pretty Good Cereal
review/text: Overall, I liked this cereal. It had some heft to it which I liked. It was supposed to have a hint of brown sugar, but I couldn't detect any. It did taste good right out of the box and with milk. It was better with a little sugar added.<br /><br />I would have given it 5 stars if I could have tasted the brown sugar and if the cereal had been a bit sweeter. As is, I gave it four stars, but I might still buy it if I saw it in the grocery store. It is pretty good, and I can always add a little sugar. And, it is supposed to be healthy too.

review/text: When ever anyone from my household go on a road trip Quaker Oatmeal Squares go along. You know you want to munch in the car but sweets are just not the way. We love having handfuls of Quaker Oatmeal Squares. They are just a touch sweet but even better they feel you up and you don't feel as if you just made a huge mistake. We eat them for breakfast too but more often as not they are a late night snack or a baggie full for the office.  We love them.

review/summary: Yummy, Filling & Healthy, too!
review/text: I love that my seven-year-old gets her fiber when eating these.  Even my toddler loves these!  They are tasty as a dry snack and even better with milk.  The texture is pleasant both ways as well, as long as you don't leave them in your milk long enough to get soggy!  The nutrition facts are great with 1 cup of cereal giving you 5g of fiber, 6g of protein, & only 9g of sugar, which isn't too bad compared to other breakfast cereals.  The ingredients are not perfect for my standards, but since my picky eater readily eats them, I'm willing to overlook that.  They have yellow 5 & yellow 6 in them.  I wish they didn't, but it's not that big of a deal to me.  I'm glad to see no high fructose corn syrup in these.  The only thing that keeps me from buying more of this cereal is the price.  I feel it's a little pricey, but it does taste great!

review/summary: Love these oatmeal squares!
review/text: Quaker Oatmeal Squares with a Hint of Brown Sugar are delicious! They do not get soggy in milk and have a mildly sweet taste that is not too sugary. The serving size (1 cup of cereal in 1/2 cup of skim milk) is a realistic portion, although I admit to not actually measuring out my serving, but rather eye-balling it. The carbohydrate-to-sugar ratio means that it will not deliver a sugar spike to your system, as is the case with very sugary cereals, and it will stick with you longer. These squares also make a good snack when mixed with hulled sunflower seeds, dried fruit bits, pretzel sticks, and/or some M&Ms -- obviously this will change the nutritional aspects of the cereal, but since you control what does into the snack mix you can make something that suits your own needs. This will be a regular cereal in my house!

review/summary: Crunchy goodness
review/text: I eat my cereal dry- right out of the box. Mostly for breakfast, but sometimes as a snack. Frosted Mini-Wheats is my "go-to" cereal, but  this had oats instead of whole wheat, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />And, now, it's my second favorite cereal. Ok, so it's didn't quite bump my "go-to" out of first place, but it came close, and in fact I think it will be my fave for breakfast (but not as much for snacking).<br /><br />It comes in a rather solid little square, with a great crunch and a good mouth feel, and it super-easy to eat right out of the box. My "Brown sugar" version had a hint of sweetness.<br /><br />Nutritionally it's two paws way up, with low fat, high fiber and not a lot of sugar.<br /><br />So- give it a try.

review/summary: Wait...what?! Bland?!
review/text: To everyone giving less stars on here for it being 'bland,' my brain is attempting not to spontaneously combust. It. Is. Oatmeal. It's not like you just went and bought a box of Lucky Charms. Do you know what else is bland? Cheerios! Doesn't make them any less amazing.<br /><br />This cereal is always exactly what I've been looking for in a cereal, something I've found almost every, single other brand, be it big label or generic lacks. It's actually filling. Sure, if you eat enough of any cereal, you'll feel full after a while, but this is the only one I've found where even a moderate bowlful leaves me feeling quite satisfied, almost like an actual bowl of oatmeal.<br /><br />Another good aspect is that it isn't overly sweet. And of course, it's whole grain and full of fiber, so, whee...it's even somewhat good for you.<br /><br />After having eaten cereal almost my entire childhood, I had lost the taste for it when I got older, and have, over the course of the past 15 years, not really had any interest in cereal products. However, since my 8 year old girl is a bit of a cereal aficionado and there is always random boxes of cereal in the house, I end up eating a bowl now and again. Until I discovered these. Suddenly, for the first time in a decade and a half, I'm back to a bowl of cold cereal every day for breakfast.<br /><br />Kudos to Quaker, you've made a breakfast cereal that I truly do enjoy.
