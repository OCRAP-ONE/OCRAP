review/summary: great product
review/text: This is a great product. It gets great coverage with no clogging, dries quickly, doesn't change the taste, and is easier to use than an airbrush. My only complaint is that if something brushes up against whatever you sprayed with this stuff, the shine will come off and attach itself to whatever brushed up against it. After you spray, be sure not to move the cake too much or brush up against it.

review/summary: Really cool stuff!
review/text: Used this to spray a castle cake (Nordic ware castle bundt pan).  It looked really great and everyone was impressed.  And it was wicked easy.  I blocked off the castle "door" so it wouldn't get sprayed and would retain its chocolate color--it seemed a bit more realistic that way.  Oh, and I did not notice any distinguishable flavor and no one complained (which my family would feel free to do).

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I ordered this because I needed to turn white sugarpaste ivy sprays into gold. I read somewhere on the chefmaster website that this particular spray is best used on dark surfaces such as chocolate, to give it a golden glow. So I ordered it not knowing whether or not it would work on white but it did! The ivy is now a beautiful shade of gold. It doesnt look at all copper colored which is what I was afraid of. Its got sparkly shine and it looks great! I am very pleased with the result, and I would recommend this spray to everyone. It smells really good when you are spraying it too, kind of like french vanilla. I didnt taste the product and I am not intending on eating the ivy so I cant vouch for taste. I think you could use this spray a thousand different ways and the result would be good!

review/summary: A Great Way To Decorate Edible Products
review/text: Chefmaster Edible Gold Spray is a really fun, simple and glitzy way I have used to add the finishing touch to some of my frosted sugar cookies and a number of cakes including wedding cakes. In general the product is easy to use and the 2oz. can holds enough spray to "shimmerize" dozens of cookies and act as a final coat to cake icing which has already been applied and allowed to set until set to the touch.<br />Before applying for the first time, I suggest experimenting by spraying on a paper towel to become familiar with the right amount of sprayer pressure. Less is definitely preferable to  over application. Several light applications are less likely to avoid a little pooled spot here and there. Keep your hand moving lightly and quickly over the item you are decorating. If minor spotting should occur let the spray dry somewhat and then blend the blemish in with a small dry paint brush. My customers like this product!

review/text: I have used my Tassimo machine for 6 years already and tried every coffee flavor available for this machine~(pods).. My preference is the morning roast by Gevalia.  It makes a large mug of smooth coffee.  The fact that I can have a fresh cup at any time of the day is huge!!! Never again will I throw out half pots of coffee because it over cooked or got cold.  The pods may be pricey, but so is lose coffee and if you throw half of it out, then it is $$ down the drain.  Amazon has the best price and auto-delivery is perfect for me.  Thank you!!!

review/text: I thought I'd give the Gevalia 12 oz. discs a try as I didn't think the the Maxwell House version was too bad.  Wish I hadn't. These discs make the MH taste gourmet in comparison.  They don't have enough flavor to produce a good 6 oz. cup let alone a 12 oz..  Years ago I subscribed to whole bean coffee delivery from Gevalia and liked their products. It appears that they're slipping.  Their espresso discs are decent though a bit nondescript, but after trying these I'll be reticent to try other Gevalia t-discs.

review/text: Some of Gevalia's earlier attempts at t-discs coffee's seemed weak and watery to me.<br /><br />This is a much better effort, and provides a full 12 ounces, which is better if you want a large cup, possibly for your go cup.<br /><br />I still found it slightly not so strong and a little bitter.  Personally, I prefer their "Dark House Blend" as my everyday morning coffee.<br /><br />I normally drink Starbucks Pike Place coffee, so I'm used to stronger flavors but don't like it bitter.  This is only ok, but is a little less expensive, per cup.

review/summary: Good as a less flavor, more brightness coffee.
review/text: This is a great coffee to have as an option, to complement the other selections from Tassimo. If you want a bigger cup of coffee which has virtually no body, but a lot of brightness (which I think is a style a lot of people like, especially for their morning joe), this fits the bill.<br /><br />It's better than the Maxwell House French Roast, which a lot of people somehow seem to enjoy. That stuff I would equate to, maybe, diner coffee, that is, folgers or maxwell house or Melita. This stuff I would equate to standard, decent coffee you can make from a typical Mr. Coffee maker at home from some bagged coffee, not grocery bought MH or Folgers or whatever.<br /><br />There are other Tassimo coffees I strongly prefer in terms of enjoying the flavor of it, the Dark Italian Roast and the Dark Breakfast Blend, and other espresso-leaning drinks I also prefer to this, the Mastro Lorenzo espresso and crema(intenso even more so for both, if I can get it). But I like having this around when I want something simple, clean, and a lot of it to sip on. It's 12 ounces, which is appreciably more than your average coffee mug, which is 10 ounces. I mean, they vary, but the "ideal Platonic mug" I get in my mind when I think "coffee mug," and I think the same goes for most people, is 10 ounces, and sometimes they're smaller, of course, although these days of course sometimes bigger. So, my digression amounts to this: be ready with a bigger mug for this one.

Here's a recipe that my even the one eyebrow raisers like:<br /><br />In a large stock pot cook a half package of bacon ends and pieces, when the bottom of the pan starts to brown and the bacon is nearly done add about 1/3 of a bottle of cheap merlot wine and get the bacon unstuck from the bottom next, chop two or three leeks ( green tops and all! ) and add those to the bacon/wine debauchery that is happening, add your conveniently packaged and delivered (and recently rinsed) Barry Farm lentils. Cover with enough water that the lentils rest under about half an inch of water. Add salt, pepper and herbs de Provence set on a medium low heat - cover for a soup, it should be ready in a little less than an hour- or - cook uncovered for about an hour for a more robust lentil side dish or some bed-for-my-salmon main course action. Quick, easy, almost healthy (curse my love of bacon !) and de-lic-ous enjoy!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FA68HY">Black Beluga Lentils, 1 lb.</a>

My dish turned out to be quite tasty and these lentils were stickier and heavier than others, however, that was the intent for what I needed. These are used quite a bit too in Indian cooking and cook in about 30 minutes (if soaked for at least an hour prior to cooking). All in all, good purchase!

Once the herbs steeped for 3-4 weeks, I move the strained mixture back to the original bottle & re-label with the recipe. Great tasting wine vinegar for this purpose! Wonderful XMas gifts for my family & friends.

The lemon is also good in combination with a mild black tea.

review/summary: An acquired taste
review/text: Rediburger is best sliced thin and fried. Served on a whole wheat bun with tomatoes, lettuce ( or better yet mustand greens), pickles, mayo, and cheese if you like it. For some reason it tasted better when I ate it back in the 70's (maybe my taste buds are just getting old). They reformulate these vege recipes from time to time I think. I used to love them! As for shipping, it was superb and delivered promptly right to my door by the UPS folks! I prefer the vege hot dogs "Vege links" or "Linketts" a 5 star for my tastes and the swiss steaks, a 5 star also. Vege meat is an acquired taste but alot better than risking disease from meat these days. If you have to watch your sodium they can be a problem, but no worse than most packaged foods. I love the little packs of yellow rice by Mahatma but they are through the roof in sodium. Hope this review helps. It probably would be wise to go to a vege food store and buy one can to try  before getting a whole case. Kroger carries a number of these in their organic foods section. If you find you like them, then buying through Amazon.com is the best way to go!!!

review/summary: Redi Burger is like vegetarian Spam
review/text: I enjoy Redi Burger. It comes in a loaf; so, you have to open both ends of the can, loosen the edges with a knife and push it out. It has a softer texture than it did some years ago. You have to slice it and then pan fry it in some oil. It is very delicious and tastes a little like spam to me. It also has the absolutely delicious smell of Morningstar Farms vegetarian bacon - but you have to really think about it to detect it. It's great on burgers or sliced and topped with gravy. I grew up on meat analogues and enjoy most of Worthington's products.

review/text: Wow! 20+ bucks more in just the last month per case.<br /><br />A 45% increase in 1 month for a simple vegetarian food staple!<br /><br />This is becoming a bit insane.<br /><br />Previous Update (2/2011): My last shipment of Rediburger confirms that the quality has resumed at the factory. The product tastes great (like it used to), and is much less mushy. I can now treat it as a solid product when making sandwiches, instead of it falling into squishy blobs. One suggestion: when the producer errs and produces an inferior product that is receiving many complaints from loyal consumers, the producer has an obligation to rectify the problem, demonstrate a bit of contrition, and perhaps send a credit to the consumers to ensure product loyalty. In this case the Kellogg representative blamed Amazon for improper storage of the product, and shirked any responsibility for a very inferior product. Not cool.

review/summary: Redi-Burger - yes, it's an acquired taste
review/text: In response to the reviewer who wrote that this product "tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture", that does not sound normal.  I've been eating this product for at least 35 years, off and on, and it is never normal for it to feel gritty or sandy.  I would return any can that had that texture.  This burger does have a finer texture, though, compared to that of Loma Linda Vegeburger or Worthington Vegetarian Burger.<br /><br />This product has a strong flavor of its own and, in my experience, doesn't do particularly well as an ingredient but stands alone much better.  I agree with those reviewers who said to open both ends of the can, push the product out, and slice it off fairly thinly.  (I usually chill the can thoroughly before opening it so the slices hold together better.)  I fry the slices in a little olive oil or butter until they're crispy on each side, then use them for sandwiches.  I like them pretty plain on a multi-grain bread, with mayo and onion, but that's just my own preference.<br /><br />I admit that this is not my favorite vegetarian burger but, every now and then, it satisfies a craving when nothing else will.

review/summary: A faithful redi-burger user
review/text: I have used redi-burger for at least 25 years now, and I agree with Mary of Carrollton, TX, who remembers the product more favorably in years past.  The product isn't as good as it used to be, but it is still the one I prefer over many other meat analogs.  I was born into a vegetarian home and have never had meat, so I have really acquired a taste for these types of products.  My children eat meat, but because of my background, they have been exposed to redi-burger and eat it quite well.  When their friends visit, I don't serve this unless I have used it in a vegetarian lasagna recipe that absolutely everyone I have ever served it to likes.  As a substitute for a hamburger, redi-burger is just too foreign, I think.<br /><br />As far as ordering this product through Amazon, I found it to be a great deal!  I haven't found anywhere else that offers a better price.  Of course, that was because of a special that ran during December.  I don't know how the normal price compares with those in a health food store.

review/summary: The worst protein/meat substitute product I've ever tasted
review/text: I bought a 12-pack of Redi-Burger about three months ago after reading the previous reviews. I have tried numerous Loma Linda, Worthington, Morningstar Farms, Boca, etc protein or meat substitute products over the past 30 years, but this is without doubt the worst of them.<br />I ordered this product for shelf storage during the winter months since my freezer space is limited and thought it would be convenient to occasionally open a can to slice for burgers, or chop up for use in tacos, chili, casseroles, etc. I expected the quality would be similar to other Worthington and Loma Linda canned products. I have tried to use this product in these various ways for several months and it's just horrible and can't be disguised even in other dishes. I'm going to donate the remaining cans to local meals program. The problem is the taste and texture. It tastes burned right out of the can, and has a sandy/gritty or mealy texture that doesn't help. After much consideration, I would describe the taste as a concentrated, burned hamburger bun that caught some of the aroma or seasonings of a hamburger or veggie burger along the way.<br />I love Worthington and Loma Linda's other products and would quickly recommend them such as the canned veggie sausage links, Tender Bites, Burger, the frozen Morningstar Farms and Boca burgers, sausage and crumbles, etc. Redi-Burger though is so bad that it could make a vegetarian reconsider eating meat.

review/text: I'm not even a vegetarian.  But my boyfriend is and he does all of the cooking.  It became a game for me to find new products for him to work with and I found the Loma Linda brand here on Amazon.  Why oh why don't more people know about this product?  I have many vegetarian and vegan friends and few have ever heard of these products.  We have tried their chicken (in various forms) and this burger is really quite good.<br />I love it so much that even though it is hard to get I have given away a few cans to friends so they can try them and they have all ordered their own since.<br />A simple and quick dinner: Slice some burgers and set them on a cookie sheet.  Place some onions and some spinach on top and then pour some baroque sauce on to taste (I like a lot).  Bake in the oven at about 350 until the sauce soaks in a little and the spinach is wilting.  Place on a bun with your choice od condiments and YUM, comfort food that's actually really good for you.<br />Enjoy.

review/summary: Redi burger--the best!
review/text: Hello,<br />For 3 months, I searched the grocery & health-food stores here in Las Vegas (LV), NV for this product (Redi-Burger).  None carried this product; and I contacted Worthington co. directly, to see if I was imagining this.  I wasn't; the co. gave me instructions on how to order it online. I had no problem finding it in Anchorage, Alaska or the US east-coast states. With so many free/low cost buffets and resturants here, most of the LV people don't desire a healthier/meatless diet; so the few stores that use to carry it, have discontinued it.  So, I was forced to order it online.  Well, I loved it, just as I did in the 70s; and prepare it as a burger (fried in olive oil, fresh ground-black pepper & garlic), and eat it every day for lunch at work--it is filling and tastes great!  The flavor has changed since the 70s--tasted more like peanuts then; and I liked it better then.  I hope the co. returns it to the original recipe soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But, I will continue to purchase it online, until I move to a town that sells it in a store.

As I drank the drinks I found myself wishing I had just made the normal Vanilla or whatever else, as this syrup did not make a fantastic drink. I also found that i had to use a significant amount of it to get a strong Peppermint flavor, which ended up making the drinks a little too sweet. This is probably the best sugar-free peppermint syrup out there, but if you want to make interesting Holiday coffee drinks, I might look to another flavor.

review/summary: If you can call chocolate "sexy...."
review/text: After my experience with the Amedei Limited Edition Chuao bar, also available on Amazon, I had to expand my horizons with Amedei and will endeavor to write reviews on all of their products. For those of you who have tried Amedei products before, you'll recognize this as blatant self-serving, but for the rest of you let me assure you that I only have the most noble of motives - to provide an honest review based upon personal experience.<br /><br />That being said, I must admit that I have become a fan of this company. Everything I've tried so far from this company has been of extraordinarily high quality, and these continue that trend.<br /><br />As noted, I first tried the Chuao bar, and had accordingly high expectations of the Amedei Limited Edition Porcelana Bar.  I was not going to be disappointed.  The difference between the Chuao bar and the Porcelana bar is like that of day and night.  While the Chuao bar is like a day in an exotic tropical wilderness, the Porcelana bar is relatively dark, quiet and seductive, reminiscent of the femme fatale in a noir film.  There is a bitterness to the chocolate that all dark chocolates have, but with this bar you must be paying attention to it to really notice the subtle presence that seems to have been there all along; by then you're so in love with the chocolate you could care less.  The chocolate melts evenly, wrapping itself around your tongue and mouth, sweetly imparting fine flavors to the palate.  It would be difficult to explain the amazing differences between this chocolate and those fine chocolates available in, say, a nice department store.  The best way I can put it is this:  Imagine that you're in a fine, upscale bar chatting with a local beauty, when from behind you a supermodel sneaks up to you, gently places her arm across your shoulders, and purrs softly in your ear, "Would you mind doing me a favor...?"  For those who think they prefer milk chocolate over dark, give this bar a try.  You won't be disappointed.  Well, at least not until you go back to your old favorite milk chocolate....<br /><br />As with any order from Amedei, it will be shipped with ice packs to preserve the integrity of the chocolate but has the unfortunate effect of driving up the total cost of shipping. Anticipate a significant shipping charge if ordering just one item. My recommendation is to order several items to spread out and justify this cost, which only makes sense as this chocolate is too good not to share with friends!

review/text: Simply put, Amadei produces the best chocolate in the world.  It's not an opinion, as much as it's a restatement of the results of the past three World Chocolate Awards.  Chuao is a lot different than the Porcelana variety.  Both are amazing, with Porcelana being the pure chocolate flavor and Chuao having more hints of fruit in the flavor.  Either way, each bar comes in ten squares.  I couldn't imagine having more than one square at a sitting.  I'd highly recommend either one of them.

review/text: Like most people, I have been a fan of chocolate for probably my whole life. However, as I have grown older, I have found that dark chocolate gives me the intensity of flavor that gives me my fix. It all started, of course, with Hershey's Special Dark chocolate, which now tastes way too sweet for my palate. Through the years there was Ghiardelli and some of the Belgian companies.  Then I discovered Scharffen Berger chocolate which I found to be as good or better than the European varieties in taste, with the added benefit of being an American company interested in fair trade and who are ecologically green.<br /><br />Through my research on the internet, I stumbled on this article about a small italian chocolate company, Amadei, who took on and beat French goliath Valhrona chocolates for trade with farmers in a precious region of Venezuela, where both chuao and porcialana beans are grown.  Well, needless to say, I got my hands (and mouth) on this chocolate and it was truly a wonderful experience.  These are single bean chocolates which allow the lucky eater to taste the subtle differences in flavors that exist in the actual chocolates themselves: from different types of fruits like cherry or banana, to nuts, spices, tobacco, coffee, and caramel.<br /><br />I have given this product, and all of the other wonderful products that Amadei makes, only 4 stars for two reasons: cost and convenience.  Regardless of whether you order it through Amazon or directly from their website, it takes forever for them to process the order, usually 4 or 5 business days.  You can have it sent standard which takes another 7 to 10 days after processing the order (for a fairly heavy fee), or expedited which takes 'only' 3 to 5 days after processing the order for even more money.  Either way, you need to be patient. (I am wondering if they have heard about airplanes at Amadei!) By the way, shipping times that I quoted are to California.  The cost of this product is the other big issue.  It is perhaps the most expensive chocolate available.  The three 50 gram (slightly more than 2 oz.) bars I recently purchased cost $58 dollars after shipping and handling, almost $20 per bar. (They are listed at an already steep price of $14 per bar.) Here's the rub: Valhrona Noir or their Extra Noir chocolates are truly fantastic and definitely competes for flavor and texture to Amadei, even though they are not single bean origin. Additionally, there are so many fine chocolate companies that have their single bean chocolates available in grocery stores here in the US, and some are very good to excellent as well.<br /><br />You'll have to decide if its worth it. If you are a serious chocolate afficianado, or just a plain old junky, buy a lot of Amadei's chocolate at one time, to defray the cost of shipping (they have multi-kilogram bags of their chocolate in little bit-sized squares.)  Or just go exploring the wonderful world of chocolate in your local specialty store.

review/text: I'm enjoying a cup of this wonderful Coconut Truffle loose leaf tea which arrived more quickly that I had thought possible.  I'm drinking it with milk and a little sugar, although it tasted quite nice without.  The packaging is good, also - good quality zip lock dark colored bag, with a clear window to see the product and an interesting informative label - I might not even use my tea caddy which doesn't have as good a seal as this bag.  Thanks to Tea Party, Inc. for this tasty black tea blend!  Off to peruse more blends!

review/summary: Sweet Deal on Organic Sugar
review/text: It's a crazy way to buy organic sugar, but I'm a believer!  I have felt wasteful buying organic sugar in those small, plastic bags, and it's expensive.  Buying it in 5# foil (recyclable) bags that arrive on my doorstep makes good sense.  I bake a lot, make my own maple syrup (1 c. sugar, 1 tsp. maple, 1/4 c. water, bring to boil, add 1 c. corn syrup and stir) and enjoy that good stuff in my coffee.  FRONTIER also distributes an excellent line of healthy spices.

review/summary: Temptation Natural
review/text: I was really reluctant to give these treats to my cat. It's really important to me that she eats a very healthy diet, and while I'm not doing the raw food diet, I do scrutinize labels for meat by-products, BHA, and useless fillers. With that said, my cat couldn't care less for those "healthy" treats that had passed my inspection. I have a cupboard full of treats I felt comfortable giving her that she ended up saving so she could play with them later. So, out of desperation, I bought these; a treat is, after all, a treat. And she goes berserk over them. She's runs to the kitchen whenever I simply open a cupboard, hoping I'm about to give her one of her precious treats. I've also finally taught her to Come on command! And, to be honest, other treats (including this brand's regular treats) have a lot worse ingredients.

review/summary: It's a Miracle!!
review/text: I have 4 cats and finding a treat that all of them will eat has been impossible for years.  I decided to try these, and every cat, including the finickiest of the 4, LOVES these treats.  I give each cat 2 of the treats in the morning, and they gobble them up.<br /><br />I gave these 5 stars because they serve their purpose well, which is making my cats think they're getting something special every day.  Keep in mind, these are not as healthy as some of the high end treats that contain no meal or by-products, so I don't want to mislead anyone on the health value.  Moderation and coupled with a high quality food, these make a nice little treat.<br /><br />Once these are gone, I will try some of the other flavors in the All Natural line; however, the Free Range Chicken Flavor will always be in my cupboard.  If you try these, I hope your cat(s) enjoys them as much as mine do.

review/text: I bought this All Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor Treats for Cats by accident thinking they were treats for dogs  But, my MinPin, Bandit, thinks their the greatest treat in the world.  I can get him to do anything for a few of these!! He would probably even stand up and dance. He's crazy about them!!! It's not just a one time thing either, as I had to go back and buy a few more packages of them. He is so picky about everything else. They should advertise for Cats and Dogs also.

review/summary: My fat cat....
review/text: spoiled little sensitive stomach shelter kittie, begs for these when the bag is first opened because the outside IS crunchy and theinside is creamy. He carefully studies his little cache of 3 or 4 and nibbles each one slowly, savoring w his eyes closed. He dropped one and with a petulant mew jumped down from his chair and went searching for it. He 'talks' to himself all the time, mewing and grunting if things are out whack...he couldnt find his little nibble so I pointed to it and he snatched it up like a greedy little thing. These treats are so loved and comforting, given along with Pet-Ease Paw Gel which I use for anxiety. This little guy was a litter runt and caged alone when I was at the shelter. These huge blue eyes and the worst smelling coast-he was sick and it seemed the vets had given up. He's a roly poly muscle bound little smarty pants now at 6 yrs and these treats keep his coat shiny and the paw gel keep him calm...if frustrated or bored he will shred paper or find some clear manner to show his upset.

review/summary: Definitely gets the cat - and human - seal of approval
review/text: I volunteer at a cat shelter so over time I've had some experience with what cats like and what they don't.  With a few rare exceptions, it is hard to find cat treats that are popular with mostly all of the cats.  So far, Natural Temptations Wild Alaskan Salmon Flavor, Natural Temptations Tuna Flavor and All Natural Temptations Chicken Flavor are proving to be three of the rare exceptions.  Just about all the kitties love these things and will follow me around when I'm handing them out so they can cadge more.  Because they are all natural and only 2 calories per treat, they are a reasonably safe and nutritious treat.  Because they are inexpensive, I can afford to bring enough for everybody at every visit!  And apparently they taste awesome.  I can buy these at my local grocery, Target, Walmart or pet store for around $1.50 to $2.00 a packet and each packet contains enough treats to provide every kitty in the shelter with a generous serving of treats. There is one negative - these treats contain a lot of grains and as a result some kitties will vomit them up after an hour (some kitties tummies will not tolerate food or treats containing grain, or more than very small amounts of grain); over the last few months I've had 3 or 4 kitties through the shelter with this issue.  Once I've identified a kitty who is grain-intolerant, I naturally do not feed it these treats or anything similar.  Note that there are several versions of the Whiskas treats that are not all natural; the kitties like them also but I prefer to feed the all natural version.

review/summary: Lock your cabinets
review/text: I have one cat who is addicted to these Temptation treats. Either the tuna of the salmon, I dont know what's in these little crunchy pillows, but he forsakes all food if he thinks there's any possibility I'll cave and slip him a few for being the cutest little meatball. His companion, a snooty long hair wont touch them and if he smells them on meatball's breath he gives him a swat for snacking between meals. So his coat seems very shiny, some months back he had flakiness which seemed to be dry skin, but the treats seem to have alleviated that. One thing I would caution is they're probably high in fat so offer them sparingly. (...right)

The other flavours may be better, although judging by my experience with these I have my doubts.  I'm disappointed.

This stuff is way better. Don't quote me on this, but I heard that Nido isn't 100% non-fat. That being the case, it doesn't keep as long as non-fat powdered milk. But I might be wrong. At any rate, it's worth it. If you really want to make it taste good just add a little bit of sugar to sweeten it up.

review/summary: Great Coffee
review/text: My husband loves this coffee.  I can't drink coffee but I make it for him and I love the smell!  Was buying a brand from Smart & Final, but they changed to smaller/fancier packaging and increased the price dramatically.  This is a good deal and I have it delivered automatically with subscription.  I find I will be doing that with more products that I use on a regular basis.  So convenient.  Love Amazon!
