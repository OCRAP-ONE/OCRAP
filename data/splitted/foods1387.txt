review/summary: tasty, healthy spin on chickpeas
review/text: Sea salt is my favorite, I think, but all the flavors are yummy. I'm trying to avoid snacks with an endless list of ingredients (and do I really need more corn or soy? no thx!). Also, I'm really glad these are roasted rather than fried. The Good Bean is such a great find, particularly since my son loves it in his lunch box.

review/summary: Ok - not quite what I expected
review/text: These have a slightly chalky, soft consistency compared to nuts.  I was expecting something a little crunchier.  I love that they are beans and have fiber (6 grams), but the taste gets a little getting used to.  The #2 ingrediant is brown rice syrup and #3 is canola oil.  And if you are watching carbs then nuts are lower.  These have 23 grams total carbs and 5 grams sugar.  The fat on the other hand is much lower then nuts - only 3 grams of fat.  140 calories so about the same calories as most nuts.  Would I buy them again?  Probably not.  I might try adding these to trail mix and that might help.  I gave them a 3 because they are edible and healthy, but maybe get a sample before buying a whole case.  By the way I love the sweet cinnamon flavor - for some reason the softer consistency was fine with the sweeter taste.

review/summary: Limp & mealy texture
review/text: I bought this variety pack on a whim, thinking it would be a great healthy snack food substitute for the bag of chips that usually goes into my lunches. Boy was I wrong. I should've listened to the other mediocre reviews of the product. The good bean has absolutely no crunch whatsoever. The beans feel limp and kind of mealy in the mouth. Do not buy this if you expect something like the crunch and texture of Corn Nuts, peanuts, or even a PopChip. I ended up donating the remaining 11 bags I could not eat to a charity food drive, and I felt bad doing so--but at least they are healthy, I suppose. My suggestion: try this product at a local grocery store before committing to a whole box on Amazon. They taste and feel highly unusual--not at all like a chickpea, and may turn off a lot of people. Caveat emptor--buyer beware.

review/text: I've tried all flavors of the Good Bean and enjoy them all. I stock up on them (personal faves are the classic sea salt and the sweet cinammon) for inter-meal munching when I want something to tide me over. This is a super satisfying snack - flavorful and surprisingly filling. The texture is a little bit of a surprise at first (they're not quite as crunchy as you might expect) but they're really delicious and a great-for-you food. Thanks Good Bean!

review/text: I was really excited to get the Good Bean sea salt snacks in the mail and slightly disappointed when I tried them. They were really chalky and a little too salty for me. But I kept eating them because, hey, I bought six bags and I wasn't going to waste them! The funny thing is they grew on me. I liked the cinnamon ones better, but I now reach for them out of a desire to snack on them rather than feeling like I have to eat them.

review/summary: Inconsistencies Between Batches
review/text: I've purchased this product many times at the grocery store before and really liked the taste. The beans were small and dry (some reviewers said chalky, but I liked the taste) and did not have oily residue from the roasting. They were much crunchier and saltier. However, I just purchased this product on Amazon, opened the package and found that the beans were bigger and almost slimy from the canola oil. This was the complete opposite of the store-bought ones. Honestly, I'd stick to buying them at the grocery store because I don't like the oily taste of the ones that I bought from Amazon.

review/summary: Not for me
review/text: I tried three different flavors and they were all pretty bad. The texture is also kind of powdery instead of that crunchy chickpea texture you might expect. The sweet cinnamon flavor is probably the worst since it smells and tastes like an old peron's house(potpourri). I bought the small snack sized version for 99 cents each and ended up just throwing them away. Also the spices were unbalanced and unevenly distributed between the peas.

review/summary: A View from the Novice Seats
review/text: I ordered the Breadman TR-875 the other day when it was a Gold Deal.  I have never used a bread machine nor made bread.  I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer.  While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain.  They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman.  The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for the Breadman. I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf.  It is fabulous.  The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature.  Today I just completed making the other five loaves.  Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six.  Everything was so simple, with a little research.  I am one proud novice; soon to be considered a professional. :)

review/text: This is one of the better bread machine mixes out there. Hodgson Mill has managed to provide us with some very fine products that don't contain a bunch of preservatives and great tasting loaves of bread.<br /><br />They are one of the only ones that recommend using the whole wheat cycle for a box mix, and it works well. This may be the reason that some reviewer wound up with a bad loaf. Funny thing is, the first time I used it, I neglected to read the instructions and used the basic white setting on my bread machine and it still turned out pretty good.<br /><br />I'll be ordering this mix on a regular basis.

review/summary: Great for the health conscious and tasty too!
review/text: I ordered this and have enjoyed eating it over the past few months. The ingredients are very healthy and pure, and best of all i love how simple they are! I am very health conscious, and avoid high fructose corn syrup found in most store bought breads. This bread has great ingredients, and not a very high sugar content either. I compared the ingredients to all the other bread mixes i could possibly find on the internet.. well, i spent all day researching, and I didn't like how others had high sugar contents (such as the number 3 ingredient being 'cane sugar' or the number 4 and 5 ingredients being sugar and brown sugar, etc). I also wanted a bread packed with whole grains, and 9 grain is great!<br /><br />And of course i looked for something easy on the wallet. I originally made my own bread and tried buying whole grain flours from health food stores but i just couldn't match 9 grains, and it got pricey. Obviously just plain white flour bread making will be cheaper than buying this boxed stuff, but i wanted whole grain bread. It turned out to be difficult exactly comparing the price of this compared with baking from scratch since all the flours are by the ounce, etc, but i decided that this price is very good. Compared to other brands of bread mix, this price is pretty much the lowest I have found with the free shipping.<br /><br />In terms of taste, honestly I really don't care as long as it's healthy, I will basically like it or learn to like it, but I will say that I love the taste of this bread and have been making sandwiches almost every weekday for the past couple months. If I want to be real nit-picky i would say the milled flaxseed SLIGHTLY gives it a bad smell, but its subtle and overall the bread still tastes great. Besides, its super healthy! I should also mention that I bake this bread using a very nice bread maker, so I would take that under consideration when reading this review. And for those that care, I bake it with some earth balance butter substitute. Lastly, if your bread is coming out a little dense, add more water and yeast and it will come out great! If you need to spice it up you can throw in some dried cherries and/or walnuts, and other things I'm sure will work too I'm sure. It was even more delicious when I did this.

Just dump it in, follow the directions, and voil&agrave;- a tasty, perfectly baked 1.5 lb loaf of bread.  The bread is very moist and airy, not dense at all.  The sliced bread results in really large slices, but we just turn them sideways and slice in half.  That doubles our production and allows for a more manageable sandwich-sized slice of bread.  This mix is just delicious and I highly recommend it.  I sliced two slices extra thick for French Toast this morning for my husband.  He said it was the best French Toast he has ever had!  Kudos!!

It is now my everyday bread, because it is tastes good, has good fiber content and ingredients you could buy at any grocery store. Its really home-made bread, but you don't have to buy all those flours and try to figure out how to store them before they go rancid.  Everything you need except oil and water is in this box.<br /><br />As healthy as it is, I wouldn't be baking up a loaf a week if it weren't delicious.  And easy!  I use it in a bread machine that has a setting for whole grain breads and gives extra time for development of the dough.  It comes out soft, but with an interesting texture.  Because you add the oil (or butter if you prefer), it has no trans-fats.<br /><br />I highly recommend!

Butter in mix recipe give the bread a wonderful, moist flavor and the texture was better than the bread at the bakery.  Very pleased with this bread mix - just ordered more.  I will be baking one of these each week.  Toasts beautifully and makes a wonderful grilled cheese sandwich.  Hearty texture for making a panini, too.  Ordered on subscribe and save for delivery each month. Next we'll try the caraway rye Hodgson Mills makes.  If you like hearty wheat bread, this one is for you.

review/summary: The Best 9 Grain Bread in a Box!
review/text: I read some negative reviews about no taste or too sweat. Then there were the ones that said it did not rise.<br />Well I thought I better put in my two cents.<br />The loaves of breads have all come out perfectly. My husband puts the bread machine on the 2lb and box mixed selections. The bread has been great. It has risen all the way and taste very good. We have tried adding nuts and dried cranberries and have really enjoyed it. So plain or with added nuts it's still wonderful.

review/text: I love the whole grain breads and this is excellent.  It is almost fool proof.  Being a man I some times think I remember the directions.  Wrong!  There are just 2 things I had to add, well I forgot to put the oil in the first loaf.  The loaf didn't rise as much as the other loaves but was still very good.  I remembered everything in the 2nd loaf and it was perfect.  I put cold water instead of warm for the 3rd loaf and it was perfect.  Was I just lucky?  I will read the box every time from now on.

review/summary: Very good, especially when I only use the dough cycle.
review/text: I like this mix. I usually make my own from scratch but during the summer I don't like all the mess and time this involves so I tried this mix and it's definitely worth the costs. I only use it on the dough setting and then bake it in two smaller loaves. The bread crust is much finer and softer, which we like. Also, we are always watching our weight and smaller bread means smaller sandwiches, toast, etc. which means fewer calories. These mixes are convenient and suit our summer schedule.

review/summary: Great, easy bread-machine mix!
review/text: Makes delicious loaves for less than the price of good bread at most supermarkets--I've started bringing them to parties instead of a bottle of wine, and they've been well received! Although it's designed for bread machines, you can easily make it by hand if you don't have one.  Perhaps because of the nine-grain flour, I've found that this bread doesn't seem to rise quite as high as some other recipes, but I haven't had a dud loaf or batch of yeast yet. The different grains make the loaf wonderfully complex without being too strong-tasting; I've tried this and the Honey Whole Wheat from Hodgson Mill, and this one is my favorite of the two. Might be good with nuts and dried cranberries added, as well!

review/text: But I do consider mixes of any kind to be expensive, so in the case of this bread mix I add more of my own flour to it and get two large loaves of bread instead of one.  No need to double the yeast when you do this, just the water and oil. It makes using a mix like this much more economical, and it's still a great, tasty bread with different grain flavors that's home baked.

review/summary: Great bread at a very low price
review/text: I've calculated out that it costs me about $2/loaf to make whole grain organic bread from scratch. Hogson Mill 9 Grain is very economical, at about $2.29/loaf, given that it is also 9 grains. It's not organic, and that's the only downside.<br /><br />I'm ecstatic with this bread! I make incredibly fluffy loaves. I do not use the included yeast, but rather use the Saf-Instant yeast (http://amzn.com/B003Z7VYXW). I microwave 1 cup + 3 tablespoons of filtered water in the microwave for 26 seconds (1300w microwave). I then add 2 teaspoons of yeast and 1 tablespoon of organic coconut sugar (http://amzn.com/B005HGOIQ4), and let set for 5 minutes.<br /><br />I then add the yest/sugar/water mix to my bread machine and dump in the entire package of bread mix. I also add 2 tablespoons of dough enhancer (http://amzn.com/B0001AVTDQ). I add 1/4 of olive oil/canola oil blend (http://amzn.com/B003WT31SY). I set the bread machine on the white bread setting, and let it do it's thing.<br /><br />These loaves are SUPER fluffy, very tasty. The whole family loves it, and now demands that I make bread regularly. I don't mind because it's less expensive than buying whole wheat bread at the store, and much tastier!

review/text: Must have been bad luck. The yeast packet was bad/inactive. The bread did not bake correctly. It was just a partially stirred mess at the bottom of the baking pan in the bread machine. (I've seen this happen before. I don't think I can blame Hodgson Mill. Please comment if you know more about this phenomenon?) I tasted some of the quasi-baked bread and could tell that it would have been generally a good loaf - not a great bread, but decent.

review/summary: Convenient mix, tasty bread
review/text: This is the third variety of Hodgson Mill bread mix we have tried, and so far it's the best of what we have sampled.  However, for whole grain bread, it isn't THAT tasty.  Nonetheless, is is infinitely easier to make bread from this handy little box rather than tracking down and assembling all of the ingredients on their own.  This mix makes a 1 1/2 pound loaf, which lasts about one meal at our house.  The procedure is pretty simple, add water, then the flour mix, yeast, and some butter and turn on the machine and wait (you only supply the butter and water, everything else is in the box).  The six boxes actually don't take up that much room, so it is not too burdensome to buy this quantity and it is handy to have the fixings for fresh bread readily available.  I give it four stars, though, because the bread isn't really all that special or tasty, although it is fine.

Amazon to the rescue.<br /><br />This bread cooks easily according to the directions even where I add crushed walnuts, raisins, flax, strawberries, vegetable pulp -- that's right, I experiment with everything.  Cleanup is a breeze if you own a sponge and a sink. Amazon ships you a case within a few days of ordering and I will likely have to go on subscription since I eat this so quickly.

I have cancelled my Subscribe and Save to the Whole Wheat and switched to this. The taste is "heartier" with a sort of chewy texture. It also smells SO good -- yeasty and nutty.

review/summary: SCRUMMY 9 GRAIN BREAD MIX!
review/text: If you're looking for a brown bread mix that's delicious and not loaded with sugar, molasses or honey, you've found it!  We're English and like our bread to be of the non-sweet variety!  We have a Panasonic bread machine (like our one at home!) and find that if we use 300 mls of water, the 'rapid bake' and 'large' settings, you get an outstanding loaf in one and a half hours - perfect!  Enjoy.

review/summary: One of our favorite breads
review/text: The Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix is one of our favorites. It has an excellent flavor and is better than any store brought bread including the artisan types. We just love to eat this fresh from the bread maker and consider it to be a dessert. We use the light crust setting on the bread maker, pour the bread mix in followed by the yeast with just the right amount of warm water...a few hours later and we have an excellent loaf of bread.

review/text: The taste of this bread is good, the ease of making the bread is good, and the overall product is o.k. But, I do not know why the bread will not rise very high. I'm new to a bread maker, finally using the one I bought 15 years ago, and though my bread tastes good, the bread does not rise very high - regardless of what I do. Still, for the cost and taste, this product is adequate. I tried one other brand and it didn't rise too much either, so perhaps its me....

Wow, what a great loaf!<br /><br />Here's the thing; if using dried peppers, put them in at the beginning. If using the fresh peppers, put them in at the time for add-ins (according to the instructions for your machine).<br /><br />Enjoy...

review/summary: My Favorite Bread Mix
review/text: Oh, the smell of this bread.  Yes, it tastes just as good.  This is called a cheeese and herb bread, but you will mostly notice the herbs.  That's fine with me because this is a delicious blend.<br /><br />I am not a sandwich person, prefer hot food, but I made a sandwich with this bread using ham, salami, mayo, and some shredded Italian cheese.  Oh my gosh, it was so good I had it for dinner three days in a row.<br /><br />I've used the mix several times in my bread machine (a mini loaf in the Just for Dinner bread machine that Amazon used to sell, gosh those were great machines), cutting the recipe in half and being rather careless about the measuring.  Came out great each time no matter how nonchalant I was about the amount of yeast, et al.<br /><br />I've also made the full recipe once with my new KitchenAid stand mixer (a Friday Sale special on Amazon -- thank you, Amazon, thank you!) and it came out even better.  I might add that there were no instructions included for mixers, just bread machine and hand.  I just did it by guesswork, and it came out wonderful.<br /><br />So no matter how I mess up this recipe, I've been successful and gotten great bread.  It is a very forgiving mix.

review/text: I bought this bread because I was buying another item and could get the $10 discount for a more than $49 purchase.<br /><br />This bread is FANTASTIC.  Great flavor, great texture, and a total hit with my company.  I'm going to feel sad after I bake the last box, but no loaf of bread, especially a loaf you bake yourself, is worth almost $3 a loaf.  If the price becomes more reasonable, I'll buy it more often.

review/text: Before you get to eat it, the smell of this bread baking is amazing. Like the other mixes I have tried from this company, the ingredients are fresh, including the yeast. Cheaper than buying bread, especially if you buy it through the Amazon subscription plan (6 @ $9.60). The cheese & herb flavor is a delicious accompaniment to any meal. Makes a great grilled cheese sandwich with provolone & mozzarella. Also makes a fantastic pizza crust.

We have been pleased with this flavor as well as the Barley and 9 Grain. This makes the best toast and bread for vinegar and oil, while the other two excel as sandwich bread as well as toast. Good stuff!
