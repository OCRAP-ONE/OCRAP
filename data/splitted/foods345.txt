review/summary: Best Energy Drink Hands Down!
review/text: I tried Spartan while on the road because I saw it in the gas station and it had cool packaging. I drank it and was hooked!  Energy is steady with an unbelievable original taste.  I tried to buy more at the next gas station and found out quickly there was limited distribution.  Thank God for Amazon, now I'll just purchase here a few cases at a time.  I ordered a few days ago and received today.

review/summary: Really glad I found this one!
review/text: I've tried every sweetener, in every calorie range, known to man and this is probably the best I've tasted for everyday use. It's not overbearing (like some dark sugars), there's no aftertaste (like sweet-ish leaves and chemicals), and it doesn't go "watery" (like many fructose-based sweeteners). It's just adds depth and deliciousness to coffee and tea without calling too much attention to itself. That's really great sugar...

review/summary: "just" a mass-market, drugstore chocolate, but excellent!
review/text: These dark chocolate truffles by Lindt are not hand-made by a chocolatier, and no doubt have ingredients to give them a longer shelf-life.  But so does Godiva, Ghirardelli, and the other major brands.<br />These truffles have an incredibly smooth, intensely chocolate center, just enough sweetness without bitterness, that makes even just one or two pieces very satisfying.  Not to mention affordable!  Pretty blue wrapping for holidays, including Chanukah.

review/text: I have been buying Progresso's soups off and on for quite a few years and have found many of them to be a bit "under the spice radar," but this one is quite good. Don't think you're going to get a restaurant quality soup, but as the wife of an Italian, this one isn't "too bad," I've been told. I do have to doctor it up quite a bit with seasonings, but other than dumping out a TON of unnecessary broth, it's quite a companion to your favorite sandwich. Even my 10-year-old requests that I add my spices to it - it's just too bland! Other than that, I do suggest you buy it but with the knowledge that you'll have to add your own special touches.

review/summary: Exceptional quality dog food
review/text: I can't rave enough about this dog food.  I had a magnificent small Boston Terrier who graced our lives for 14 years.  For the first 5 or 6 years he ate what we thought was a good quality pet store brand food.  He seemed to thrive well so we didn't think twice about it until he started having a strange odor and his coat started to look unhealthy and his little pink skin started showing through.  Still, we had no idea that it was the food that was causing these problems.  Fortunately we found out that he had a wheat allergy and the primary ingredient in his food was wheat!  Poor dog..we were slowly killing him with his dog food.  After much research we purchased this food and he became well again.  His coat brightened up and his breath became tolerable again!  He lived a long and happy life until this past April when he passed on.  This past week we were graced with a shelter dog of about 8 or 9 years old.  We don't know to much about him as he was "dumped" dog, but we know that he loves his Nutro Ultra Senior Dry Dog food!  Please take the wheat and junk fillers out of your dog's food by switching to Nutro Ultra.

review/summary: Great quality, excellent price
review/text: This is a great dry dog food for seniors. In fact, my young dog prefers it to the Nutro Adult in the purple bag, this is so tasty. It has had a new face lift recently, new formulation, and they are even more crazy about it. The nuggets are a bit more plump and now multicolored and they do not look nearly as dry and crumbly. My dogs like it as much as ever and there has been no stomach upset from any change.<br />If you are looking for a high quality dog food that even many allergic dogs can eat, this is it. (My dog nearly died after eating one mouthful of Merrick Senior Medley, he got so sick. Other friends also report their dogs not being able to eat Merrick in wet or dry because of allergies.) If you are looking for a great senior food, this will keep your older pet looking slim and trim provided you follow the instructions on the bag. (As a side note, the canned food is also very good, but unfortunately, really not good value compared with the dry, and compared with other brands of canned, just as Natural Balance and Natural Balance Limited Ingredient.)<br />After the latest food recall, I also just want to remind people to always wash their hands before and after feeding their dog. It should be common sense but sadly it is not.  Salmonella abounds and while it will not usually harm a pet, it can harm humans. I love this food because it is so wholesome for my pets and so safe. 30lb bag is great value too.

review/summary: Recommended for All Rescued Hounds
review/text: I know this food is pricey, but if you can afford it I feel it is one of the best on the market especially for senior dogs who have suffered maltreatment or malnourishment. I use this in rescue when a dog has come off of canned food and is finally able to eat dry kibble. Powerful antioxidants help to strengthen a dog's immune system and provide joint support. My vet approves and my dogs have thrived over the years on this. I do think it's perfectly acceptable to switch to a less expensive quality food once a rescued animal is doing well, but just like humans who are trying to recover, dogs need the best when trying to regain their health.

review/text: Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.  Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control fit my family's needs, but you should make sure you really look at the different products' nutritional information.  You can compare Quaker's products on their website: [...].

review/summary: Bad aftertaste
review/text: 2 points for nutritional numbers, convenience and texture, but compared to other instant oatmeals, the flavor is awful. There is a bitter artificial sweetener taste (remember saccharin?), as well as a hint of artificial butter flavoring; never tasted that in any Maple & Brown Sugar product. For me, it's even a little too salty. These noticeable flavors overwhelm the M&BS goodness.<br /><br />I bought this at a supermarket, and am debating whether to throw the rest out (have strong moral issues with wasting food), or saving it for an emergency. Will never buy again.

I figured maybe it was just a bad batch. I tried again with this order, eww, yuck, gross, disgusting. Even the smell isn't right!

He never was crazy about instant oatmeal until Quaker Oats came out with this more nutritious product. Although we both prefer Old Fashioned Quaker Oats, the instant is much handier.

The packets include extra soy protein and vitamins and are effectively a meal in themselves.While I can clearly taste the maple flavor, we have not experienced the strong smell complained about in at least one other review. This is a great snack or weight-loss meal if you like oatmeal. Unlike the relatively expensive diet company product, I find no need to add flavoring to this product.

review/summary: Don't Buy This Flavor--Smell Overload
review/text: I regularly buy the flavor variety pack in the grocery store because that's all they carry. I logged on to trusty ol' Amazon to see if I could order just cinnamon or just banana bread. They're way more expensive than this flavor, and here's why: this is the worst one. It smells fine, at first, like pancake syrup, but then you realize that you can smell it for days after you've cooked it. Seriously. My husband asked me last Saturday if I was making something for breakfast, and when I told him no, he looked at me strangely. Later he told me that he thought I had cooked myself some breakfast and didn't want to share! The smell was from this flavored oatmeal I had made on WEDNESDAY. Even just picking it up while shuffling through and looking for a cinnamon packet can cause the smell to linger on your hands for hours. The taste is pretty strong, too...it's not necessarily bad, it's just overpowering. Like I said, it smells like pancake syrup, and that's pretty much what it tastes like--really sweet syrup. I would advise you go out and buy one variety box at the store before committing yourself to 4 whole boxes of syrupy sweetness.

review/summary: Good, but leaves smell in microwave for WEEKS!
review/text: I originally bought a variety pack of the weight control oatmeal to see what the different flavors were like.  This particular flavor is actually pretty good, but I enjoy the banana bread and cinnamon weight control flavors better.  The thing I cannot get past on the maple and brown sugar flavor is the STRONG maple syrup smell!  You can smell it through the packets and the box.  When we heated in our microwave, the microwave had a strong maple syrup smell for THREE WEEKS.  After 1 week, I cleaned the inside of the microwave (even though it didn't need it) and it still retained the smell.  I just can't handle smelling that forever, so I will not be buying this kind anymore.

review/summary: Tastes artificial, not healthy, stay away.
review/text: My wife bought this along with regular Quaker maple oatmeal.  I figured I'd give it a shot. Huge mistake. First off, the "healthier" one has the same amount of calories (160) and higher fat (3g vs 1g) than the normal oatmeal.  Secondly, it tastes like I'm eating a bowl of sweet and low. It literally did not smell like anything edible. Buyer beware.

review/summary: I wonder how long it will be available?
review/text: I like this product a lot, particularly the fact that it uses natural sweeteners. But, how long will it be around? My local grocer quit carrying it, and the official Quaker website doesn't list the weight control version. So I'm guessing it'll only be around while supplies last. I switched to Old Fashioned Oats and simulate the maple and brown sugar flavor by adding maple extract and molasses. But that gets tedious, (and maple extract is pricey) especially after work when I'm tired but want a good bowl of oatmeal.

review/summary: "The crazy kid eats the stuff..." and Mom is happy.
review/text: My older kids won't eat it if we paid them and it tastes kinda borderline to me.  But my 15 month old (who is picky) loves it.  I try to feed my kids food I prepare from my own kitchen, but this little guy wasn't getting enough iron.  The doc has put him on a high iron diet.  He always analyzes his food visually and won't let us pry open his mouth if it doesn't pass inspection.  But he willingly tasted this before he saw the green puree and was instantly sold!  I suspect he likes the cool delivery system. I'm checking with the manufacturer to see if it really is 120% DV for iron, or if it's a misprint.<br /><br />*** Update!  Yes, Ella's reports that it was a misprint and the company is working hard to fix the problem.  4% is the actual number.  That fits more with spinach's DV's.  Only way to get that high is to add iron supplements!  Glad I checked.  Got a quick and honest answer from them.  Hope they are able to fix labeling issues soon. It's still on our list of foods to boost iron levels.***<br /><br />I found some on sale in a local grocery store.  Amazon's price came pretty close, and is still cheaper than other online places I've found.  Including the manufacturer's website.<br /><br />Each kid has their own tastes, so don't write it off because it looks or tastes nasty to others.  Worth a try at least once (it might help to not look disgusted when you give it to your kids).  Seems to be a good product.  Now the frugal mom in me is trying to figure out if I can trick him by making my own puree and using a syringe to re-fill the bag so he'll eat!

review/summary: Great Product -- Amazon Rip Off
review/text: I make all my daughters food and thankfully she prefers what I make over jar food.  I do have those times when I need something quick to grab on the go.  Ella's Organics is a great go to. Paying this much for one pouch is a huge huge rip off.  Usually Babies R Us has them for $1 - $1.40 most likely on sale for a dollar though.  I am really happy with the Happy Baby brand too ... also almost $2 a pouch but usually on sale. Just last night my local grocery store had a 10/$10 sale on this brand.<br /><br />Seek out this product just never for this price!! Yikes.

review/summary: So far she likes it!
review/text: I can hardly contain my excitement so I had to post a review. My baby is almost 17 months old. When she first started solids at around 6 months, she was adventurous and tried and ate everything, including a great amount of veggies. When she turned a year old, she got really fussy and turned her little nose up at every single veggie we tried to give her. She would only eat fruit and yogurt with her cereal in the morning and for the rest of the day she would only accept meat. This has been going on for so long now that I began to get really really worried that she wasn't getting enough good nutrition. I had seen Ella's pouches, but hadn't tried them. A friend highly recommended them to us this weekend so I figured we should try it. I decided to go full on veggie and try this flavor (spinach, apple, rutabaga), and just give them away if she really hated it.<br /><br />Ok, so I'm only giving it 4 stars just in case things change, BUT i tasted one just now and thought, yuck, ok, this is REALLY strongly spinach flavored, she is NOT going to eat this, but I gave her the pouch and she gobbled it DOWN! She was still trying to get some out of the empty pouch! I can't believe it. I'm a very pleased mama. My fussy baby ate spinach, woohoo! :)<br /><br />I'll see how things go over the next few pouches, but so far I recommend them for fussy eaters. If she continues to like this one, I will try a few more. Thanks Ella's kitchen!

See that difference? The stuff tastes just as good, I've tried them. In fact, the broccoli one of Ella's is disgusting, in my opinion. I like the brand that starts with a "P", second word Organics. Not the bunny. These get one star for pricing. The star is given because the product is nice, but 4 stars are taken away because of the complete highway robbery of offering these in a pack of only 7 for $39.95. Don't encourage them.

review/summary: I am so disappointed with this company - buyer BEWARE indeed
review/text: After reading the reviews here stating that the Iron content of Ella's Kitchen Spinach packs was incorrect, I checked out their website to see for myself. Hmm.. no announcement there stating that an error had been made. So, I contacted the company wondering if it was a misunderstanding. No, it's true. The Spinach flavor only has 4-6% DV of Iron... NOT 120% as has been clearly indicated on the pouches I have been buying for my son for OVER A YEAR! I have been purchasing these packs by the case thinking that if my son did not eat enough other Fe-rich foods on a particular day, at least he would eat this. I mean you know how difficult it can be to get little ones to take in enough iron, so I thought this was a great option. IF I HAD KNOWN that it only contained 4 or 6%, then I would have given my son other additional Fe-rich foods or continued making my own purees. I guess I should have known it was too good to be true when I noticed that the first ingredient is in fact APPLES not Spinach as the front of the pouches would have you believe.<br /><br />What upsets me the most is that there is not even a warning or announcement on Amazon or at Target stores stating that there has been a mistake?!! If the company knows, why isn't this info passed on to the consumer?!!? Here I thought I was purchasing (a more expensive) but also more nutritionally complete product for my baby and to find out it's just as void of nutrients as all of the other brands on the shelves. I really thought this company was exciting and different and focused on kids' nutrition and health. I guess not. I am asking for a refund at the very least. Honestly, the company is lucky if parents don't decide to take up a lawsuit for their negligence in getting the word out. The incorrectly labeled packs should be recalled like anything else- not left on the shelves to trick parents! Normally, I am not one to overact and am certainly not litigious in the least. Humans (and companies run by humans) make mistakes. It's natural. But as a physcian and a mother, I am really annoyed by the lack of respect shown to consumers in failing to notify the community of this error.

review/summary: Tasty, a little bit runny
review/text: Great product.  For my older daughter, I made all organic baby food homemade.  Since we moved after the birth of my second child, we aren't able to get a nice fresh variety of organic fruits and veggies like we used to, so I decided to try buying organic baby food instead. My kids love these pouches (give or take a few of the flavors). I love the pouch packaging for easy clean-up, compact travel and not having to worry about carrying glass jars around.<br /><br />Both my infant (9 months old) and toddler (2.5 years old) love this flavor of Ella's the best, much to our surprise.  I think it's probably b/c it one of the few foods without bananas added.  It is a bit runny, so keep that in mind when using a spoon to feed.  But since it's so runny, it's good for younger ones that aren't used to thicker solids.<br /><br />The Spinach, Peas and Pears from Plum Organics is similar in taste, but is a little thicker, if the consistency of this one isn't right for you.  Also, we often mix this with some rice cereal to thicken it up if needed.<br /><br />I would recommend buying the variety pack to see which ones your kids might like.  Also, if they don't like it at first, don't give up, give them some time and try it again later.  They might change their minds.

The only ingredient not in the title is lemon juice.  No crazy preservatives or other ingredients.  The problem is the company that is selling them on Amazon.  Don't take it out on Ella's.  You can find it MUCH more reasonably priced on diapers.com, or at Target.  I agree w/ another reviewer that the Plum organics baby food is also good, and a little cheaper, but this is still a staple in our son's diet.

review/summary: Happy baby makes a happy mommy!
review/text: My son LOVES the Ella's kitchen line of organic baby foods. By far his favorite has to be the Spinach, Apple and Rutabaga. I'm always tasting his foods before I give it to him and this is something I would eat! My son was EBF until 6 months, and I started out making his own organic baby food, but working full time and being a single mom it was taking up too much time that I could be spending with my son. I researched the Ella's kitchen organic baby food and decided to try it out, and we haven't found a kind he dislikes! This has made feeding time a joy for both of us.

review/summary: incorrect nutrition facts
review/text: I will say that my son has enjoyed this product.  HOWEVER, i'm extremely disappointed to see that the nutrition facts on the package are incorrect.  The package says 45% of iron RDA but if you check the website, it only has 4%.  It feels like the company is intentionally misleading (similar error occurred on other flavors) to get people to buy this product.  Disappointed in the company.

review/text: My 6 month old son's favorite flavor.  Whenever he is teething or has a stuffy nose & doesn't want to eat, I give him this.  Works every time.  He loves the flavor & I was comfortable with the ingredients after already trying all the stage 1 foods.<br />These cost $1.89 each at Target, we got them for about $1.50 each with subscribe & save.  Still pricey, but worth it when I see how much he loves this combo.

review/text: I love this product. First of all it's a great blend of fruits and vegetables.  My daughter loves it.  She is now almost 1.  I didn't get why it was so expensive at first. But after trying Happy Baby and Plum pouches I realized that this product stands alone.  The other organic baby food pouch manufacturers really thin it out with water. This is much more concentrated.  My daughter loves it and we're getting more nutrition in every pouch.  It's also a lot easier to control and prevent spills because a gentle squeeze doesn't send the food oozing out everywhere.  I love it and highly recommend it.

review/summary: More please!!
review/text: I found these wondering the isle of Target one day.  I'd decided to try baby food again because all of a sudden she stopped eating fruits and veggies.  Won't touch them if she recognizes them.  I don't know if a carrot or a pea chased her in one of her dreams, but it's been a nightmare trying to force her to eat them.  So for a time I just gave up and then she gained weight...oh no.  So went to find some baby apple sauce and stumbled upon these.  Best. Discovery. Ever.<br /><br />I take 2 with me when we're out, and give them to her when we're in the car or in between plays on the playground.  The best part of these is that I can 'inject' these into her when we're rushed. She's loved all of the flavors except for the Sweet Potatoes, and gets a kick out of eating them herself.<br /><br />After calculating what it would cost for me to make such concoctions (cheap but time consuming) and taking into consideration the method of delivery (the spouted pouch, which is about 50% of this product's wow factor) that I can not imitate, Amazon is the very best place to buy these yummy pouches.  Amazon's price makes my daughter consuming 2-3 of these a day affordable.

review/text: I am a dad who likes to get things in bulk so I can stock up and save while getting quality stuff for my kids. My wife does the picking of which organic stuff we buy. She tries them all with the kids and the best match up so far has been the Ella line. They haven't gotten bored of them for 6 month straight now. Not bad. But within that brand, it's the sweet potatoes, pumpkin, apples, and blueberries that both kids will gobble up. I think it's the combination of the purple packaging and the blueberry flavor. But that's just my opinion.

Curious to know what flavor could have produced such a strong response from him, I tried the pouch myself.  EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWE!!!!!  I've never tasted anything so vial in my life.  Had we not been out in public at the time I would have spit it out on the floor.  Instead I forced myself to swallow, threw the package away immediately, and apologized profusely to my son for trying to make him eat it.  I shudder just thinking about that one awful bite I had to endure.  Blech.

So although this product is far more expensive than alternatives, given the taste and nutrition, this has become the one 'vegetable' I am guaranteed my daughter will consume every day.

review/summary: BUYER BEWARE! Read the nutrition label on Ella's website
review/text: This stuff is garbage and Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit product like this one had so much calcium (10%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it HAS NO CALCIUM%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (butternut squash, carrots, apples, prunes: 30% calcium on package but 2% on the website, carrots, apples, parsnips 30% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

Now that he's a toddler he refuses almost all fresh fruits and vegetables, even the ones that he used to love.  I use these to sneak healthy food into him!  I keep some organic baby food pouches in the car, so that I always have a healthy snack on hand for him.  He loves them!<br /><br />Note that these aren't as sweet as some of the other organic baby food pouches (such as Happy Tot's Spinach, Mango, and Pear).  If I give my son a sweeter pouch first, and then this pouch, he refuses this one.  If you think your child will eat more than one pouch, offer this sweet potato/pumpkin pouch first!  I am so grateful for these!

review/text: My son is now one, and looooves these little pouches. I can't even go through the baby food aisle at the grocery store without him seeing these and crying for one. I love the packaging because it is so easy for him to hold and eat off the spout. Plus, these are great to put in his diaper bag for snacks when we're out running errands or to feed him at a restaurant. He loves all the flavors of these, there are other brands out there that he didn't like and when I tried them they were not very good. I have tried these and they are very tasty, which I was surprised because some of the combos don't sound like they would taste good (spinach, apple, rutabaga?). I am from Dallas and I get them from a grocery store here called Central Market and they normally sell them at less than $2 but will have sales where you can get them at around $1, so that is when I stock up. The product is excellent, but I think the price you pay on Amazon is very high compared to other places where you can get a better price.

review/summary: Baby loves this food!
review/text: This food is not as smooth as some of the others and is a mixture of 4 foods, so I didn't start feeding it to my baby until he was 6-7 months old.  He's 9 months old now and still loves it, and I think it's better now that it isn't as smooth.  I could see feeding him this for awhile longer alongside solids or as a snack.  The only downside is the price, but I guess it's not much more than other pouches.

review/summary: Looks and smells gross, but my baby wouldn't stop eating it!
review/text: Our pediatrician recommended this flavor combination when we first started solids because it has 120% of daily iron needs.  Well, when I sat down to feed it to my baby, all I could was, wow, this is so gross!  It looks pretty much the same way going in as it does coming out, if you know what I mean.  To my surprise, my picky eater gobbled it up!  She ate more of this than any other baby food flavor we had offered.  A 2-3oz package of anything else was lasting two days, but she ate almost the whole 3.5oz package of this in one sitting.  I did taste it, and the apples make it sweet and appetizing (and I really do not like spinach).  We've had more success with Ella's Kitchen than any other brand, but this flavor especially has been great.  Looks gross, smells gross, sounds gross, but I say, give it a try.

review/summary: Helpful for kids with special needs, too
review/text: My son is 8 but due to his disability is on a very low calorie diet and has issues chewing many low calorie foods such as raw veggies.  These packets are a fun way for him to enjoy a low calorie snack when we are on the go (only 35-40 calories for many of the packets).  He loves the taste and of course there is no worry about choking hazards.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they are extremely pricey, even at the lowest price I could find it really adds up.

review/summary: Great baby food!
review/text: When my 4 month old son sees these brightly colored pouches he sits straight up in his high chair and starts to get excited. All the flavors are really yummy. ... I've tried everything that he's eaten at this point.<br /><br />I really like that these have no additives... They didnt even add water. Just pure organic fruit and vegetable pur&eacute;e. I figure that he's going to have so many processed food options in the future that I might as well give him the best I can now.<br /><br />I purchased the Boon Spoons (got a 3 pack of the 2-spoon sets from the big T for less than a 2 pack here on amazon) and they work perfectly with these pouches too. Very convenient to take on the go.<br /><br />I continue to purchase these pouches, though I usually buy a couple individual packs from T before buying the 7 packs here on Amazon so I can make sure he likes them.

review/text: When I can't get my son to eat anything else (fussy, teething, etc) he'll always eat this.  Tastes delicious with a mix of baby cereal and formula.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: I have been buying Ella since my son was 6 months old. Once I moved back to the States I was pleased to find the Ella product here. I was also buying Gerber Organic and then one day I studied the label and realized that only Ella was truly just pure veg and fruit whereas the other organic baby food as other random things to help the shelf life. Ella is worth the price and is so easy to mix in with chicken or fish to make it easier for your little one. Although my son is now 16months, I still use Ella when I am short on time and don't have time to make fresh veg or fruit.

review/summary: Like eating a tube of jam!
review/text: My daughter is a strawberry fiend so I thought this would be perfect for her, but she just spits every bite out pretty violently, LOL! I tried it myself in exasperation and it really tasted like a spoonful of strawberry jam. GROSS.

review/text: when my son is teethy and/or fussy and won't eat anything else, this is the one thing he will eat.  Awesome!  I tasted it and it really gets five stars for something that's got veggies in it, too.

review/summary: LOVE Ella's Kitchen
review/text: I love Ella's Kitchen organic baby food. It's easy to take on the go. It is also the first baby food my child ever ate. She refused Earth's best and Gerber. The sweet potato, pumpkin, apple, blueberry flavor was always her favorite. I tasted it...and it is actually really good!  Great product and healthy!
