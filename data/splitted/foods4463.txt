review/summary: Excellent blend to wake me up in the morning
review/text: We were glad to see that Amazon started carrying this Colombia Blend. After discovering it in Europe and bringing several pacakges over, we later had some shipped to us from family in Belgium.<br /><br />This has a good strong taste and I particularly like it in the morning.<br /><br />Recommended for any Senseo lover tired of the regular blends found in the retails stores.

review/summary: Hot and Cold
review/text: This plant was shipped to me very quickly, however it was mailed during winter and arrived nearly dead. That explains the COLD part of the title. I found the contact number for the company and called them but they did not answer their phone. I was surprised since the company has a 5 star rating. Now comes the HOT part of the title. No, it wasn't me getting hot under the collar. Imagine my surprise when they called me back in about 1 hour! I had not left a message, or a number, but they called! Next thing I knew they were arranging for a replacement to be shipped in the warmer months! Now THAT is customer service. By the way, before the plant completely died I noticed that it has a unique scent to it. I found it a very "green and earthy" scent. I am really looking forward to spring!

Just the right amount of chocolate to satisfy the sweet tooth while being healthy at the same time!  I like these and the other Kashi cookies, I think they are called the happy trail mix or something.  Also if you don't eat them right away it does help to put them in a zip lock baggy otherwise they get a bit hard if left open in the box.

review/summary: Not bad, but not good either
review/text: These cookies are a little strange. They are a bit chewy. They are a little dry. But the grains do appear to be healthy and much better than other cookies. They need to be bigger / MORE and cost less. There is only 8 small ones in the box and most of the box is packaging. Which makes it look like there could be more, but isn't. I hate it when manufactures do this, its the old "packaging con." They should be taxed for excessive use of packaging, especially plastic.. erhmmm erhmmm.. Cos*co. Each of the cookies is a bit small, some in the box are smaller than others. You could easily eat 3-4, then that would be almost half the box consuming more than a dollar. I would give then 4/5 stars if they put 16-20 in a box for the same price, and I bet the same size (volume) box would be possible too!

review/summary: Delicious cookies but cheaper in retail stores
review/text: Cookie:<br />-Kashi Dark Chocolate Chip cookies are the only packaged cookies I will buy.  Although buying a Kashi cookie makes you FEEL healthier, whole grains, hearty taste, etc; be careful with the calorie content - Each cookie is around 150 calories which is a lot when these are so good and it's difficult to eat just one.<br />-Texture of these for pre-packaged cookies is AMAZING.  Each cookie is about 2 inch in diameter but very thick - you can cleary see the oatmeal and chocolate chips.  These are very satisfying<br />-Chewy, moist cookies; not hard at all<br />-8 cookie to a box - these will go fast once you open them<br /><br />Price:<br />-I've seen the price on these cookies on Amazon vary between $9-12 for a pack of 3.  This is not as good of a deal as you can often find in retail stores.  At Kroger and Target I've seen regular price vary between $3-4 per box everyday, but if you wait for a sale you can get them at $2-$2.50 which is much cheaper than any online prices I have seen<br />-Considering these cookies are only 8 to a box, they are kind of expensive per cookie; the quality of these cookies however is outstanding

review/text: Great taste and very moist.  Plenty of chocolate to satisfy cravings!  Be sure to seal them in a plastic bag/container after opening or they will dry out within a day or two.<br /><br />I would give this 5 stars if the cookies were individually wrapped or had a resealable inner bag.  The plastic tray they are shipped in makes the inner package awkward to reseal, and a large freezer bag is needed to accommodate the whole thing.  I usually end up repackaging them into a quart sized bag after opening.

review/text: These cookies are a great alternative for someone with a craving for something sweet. They're much healthier than an ordinary cookie since they're made with rolled whole oats and a multitude of ingredients containing healthy fats. For someone in a rush or looking for something on-the-go, these are perfect.<br /><br />Despite their taste and healthier attributes, these cookies suffer from the same flaws that are evident in similar goods. Once a box of cookies is opened, it's important to place them in an airtight container, otherwise they harden quickly. A minor gripe of mine is that these cookies are dry due to the ingredients, but it's not a big deal if you have something with it such as a glass of milk.

review/text: Okay, keep in mind, it's kashi, it's healthy, it's full of real food, in as much, these are more substantial (read thick and grainy) than a regular cookie...these are not going to taste like chips ahoy...the cookies are rather dry (and i do have some concerns about the little packs in the boxes that keep the cookies ...umm fresh) I'm not sure how safe/healthy those are but i'm not a scientist so i'll leave it at that (I guess they are moisture control) anyhow, all in all these cookies are good for someone who want's a cookie/bit of chocolate but without the guilt factor. These are one at a time sized cookies, and I actually can't imagine wanting to eat more than one at a sitting anyhow because they are kind of hard to work through (See grainy/dry) but the flavor overall is good, just sort of off putting texture wise...All in all though these are a healthy option for cookie lovers.

review/summary: Kashi Oatmeal Dark Choc: Didn't quite make it . . .
review/text: I gave this product a try, as I've enjoyed other Kashi products, but was mucho disappointed. It tasted like there was "something wrong", meaning I don't think it was spoiled or that the product was anything but fresh and as it was supposed to be. But the taste had that  "messed up taste like it was a healthfood". I personally find this to be a turn off. The cookies were quite thick, with a "healthfood taste" to them. I don't know how else to describe it. I'd never mistake it for a real cookie, and it also fell apart while trying to eat it, given how thick it was, and the fact that the "dough" or "batter" (if you might even call it that) couldnt stick together due to the ingredients being too healthy. While I'd signed up for it as a subscription item, I've just cancelled it from my orders.<br /><br />If you don't seem to notice or matter when eating healthy snackbars that are made to taste like a protein bar or some other "healthy snack", maybe you'll love it. But I wanted it to taste like "the real thing", which it couldn't come close to. So sorry Kashi. Maybe another time another place . . .

review/summary: Looks just like the picture
review/text: Delicious cookies and having the luxury of having it delivered to your door at a great price is awesome! I subscribed because I know that I will be running out and love that they will be at my door when I'm low in stock. The big box stores carry them but at up to a couple dollers more a box. They look just like the picture on the box, they are so soft and chewy and the taste is delicious. They come in a vacume sealed package so I suggest once you open them you place the entire package minus the box in a gallon sized zip lock bag because they will go stale quickly. I experienced this when my hubby was "sleep walking" and opened up the box and placed the package back in the box and the next morning they were all hard and stale. We ended up eating them over the course of a couple days with milk/coffee and dunking them. Another way I store them is in a air tight container I picked up at the doller store and placed each cookie in a sandwich bag and placed them in the jar. That way when I'm packing the hubby's lunch I just grab a cookie in its sandwich bag and throw it into his lunch pale. I mention my husband alot because he constantly talks about these cookies to his friends, we had one of them come over the other day and he ran over to the jar and had him try one. His friend was HOOKED now he is also a loyal customer as is his wife. We don't really care for the raisin variety which is sad because I typically love raisin cookies. If I were you I'd just order this flavor.<br />Oh I also forgot to mention that I have also heated one up in the microwave for about 8 seconds and since it's already a soft cookie it makes it so crumbly that you can imagine it just came out of an oven!<br />Enjoy!

review/text: Just bought some of these today at my local store after reading some reviews on amazon. I must say, they're pretty good. I can see how they could get stale quickly-could have better packaging-but I just put them in a plastic bag inside the box after I opened them. Probably going to go ahead and order them on here from now on. It is a way better deal than buying the single box in the store.

review/text: These are very good cookies, considering that they are "healthy" ones. They have a good amount of chocolate and sweetness (almost to the point of being too sweet for a "healthy" cookie) but may indeed seem a bit "dry" so make sure you have your milk or other liquid drink nearby. I think the biggest downside is that they are relatively expensive, with only 8 cookies per box.<br /><br />TIP: Try them with some peanut butter spread on top.

review/summary: Delicious and filling
review/text: These are great for store-bought cookies. Yes they're expensive, so I don't buy them very often. But they are pretty decent ingredient-wise (no HFCS or trans fats) and I don't ever feel like I need to pig out on them; which is a good thing because you only get eight in a box.<br /><br />I'm quite sure Kashi makes a pretty penny on their products because of their image. Not everything Kashi makes though is worth the money. These cookies are an exception though. They are sort of a treat--I wouldn't eat them every day. But when you do eat one you feel like you ate something substantial.<br /><br />The ones amazon sent had a full six months before their expiration date, which is plenty. I agree though that this is one product that truly loses a lot of quality as they get too old. I guess that means they aren't packed full of preservatives, though I'm sure they have some.<br /><br />In short, if you like dark chocolate and oatmeal then I'm pretty sure you'd like these cookies.

review/summary: Great option for those looking for healthier cookies
review/text: I realize that the term "healthy cookie" in itself is a bit ironic, but Kashi has managed to create just that - these cookies are great, and best of all, they're not too bad for you. If I'm getting a craving for something sweet, I can go for one of these and feel totally satisfied. Only 8g of sugar per cookie, and 5g of fat which is a tad higher than I would have liked but I would guess if they had cut more fat out they would have sacrificed a lot of the taste. The cookies are a little smaller than I was expecting, and like others have previously said they are kind of dry, but neither factor really bothers me. Bottom line: ditch the Chips Ahoy and Oreo cookies and try these instead. Wonderful alternative, and I personally think that $8.99 for three boxes was a pretty good deal.

For a while they were my breakfast routine ( a cup of tea and a cookie).  But, then I got bored.  Not because the cookie wasn't good, I just can't eat the same thing for breakfast every day for that long.<br /><br />I had wanted to do the cookie diet, but it's all about calories in and calories out.  This was a great alternative.  Less calories per cookie than the Cookie Diet, and the Cookie Diet Cookie's taste horrible.<br /><br />Try them, you'll like them if you like healthy stuff without all the chemical crap.

review/summary: Nothing to write home about
review/text: I believe I ordered this product twice from Amazon. Both times I ordered these, it was because the price was so low that I couldn't resist. But now (~ 1 year later), I can totally resist and will never order them again. In fact, I still have an unopened box in the cupboard (which I should probably toss, since it expired months ago).<br /><br />(1) These cookies just aren't sweet or moist enough for me. They're just so meh. They aren't awful-tasting -- it's not like I want to spit it out.  But once I finish the first, I won't want a second.<br /><br />(2) The packaging is terrible.  It is, as another reviewer stated, designed to look like it contains way more product than it does. So wasteful.  The upside is that if you buy a 3 pack and it is close to their expiry date and you like the taste, you should be able to finish them in time because there aren't many cookies/package.<br /><br />As always, Amazon's packing was good.  None of the cookies arrived broken or squished.<br /><br />My 3-star rating is based off the fact that I only paid $6 -7 for 3 boxes (I think).  If the price were > $7, I would rate this product 2 stars.

review/text: These were on sale recently and we decided to try them out.  They are chewy but not so soft that they break off when you grab them out of container.  There were some funky artificial scent to them which turned off one family member and she usually loves oatmeal cookies.  Taste wise they were decent but overall, everyone agreed that they were little too sweet.  Kashi is known for wholesome, healthy, natural products and we usually buy their breakfast cereals but we weren't impressed with these cookies. Make sure to check the ingredients and nutritional info before buying, these are not the usual low carb, high protein product that Kashi is known for.

review/summary: Excellent seasoning!
review/text: My friend introduced us to this seasoning after she had my family for dinner. My husband and I couldn't get enough of the chicken she made.  When I asked her what amazing marinade was on it, she said it was olive oil and this seasoning- that was it!. Her brother, who's a chef, recommended it.  I went to 4 different stores looking for it. It never dissapoints. If I need a quick dinner, I take an 8 piece cut-up chicken, pour a little olive oil over it, rub it in, then sprinkle the rotisserie seasoning over it (maybe 1-3 tbsp), rub that in, too, and that's it. No salt and pepper is needed.  Sometimes I cut up onions and put them in the bottom of the pan. I bake everything at 375, covered, for an hour, or until I see it's done, then uncover it to let it brown...best chicken, ever! And the seasoning is kosher, so it's perfect for Shabbos chicken.  This week I put fingerling potatoes and sliced onions in the bottom of the pan, tossed them with a little garlic powder, olive oil, salt and pepper, then put chicken on top and seasoned like I mentioned above, letting some of the rotisserie seasoning fall on the potatoes....it was wonderful!

review/summary: Doesn't taste as good as it sounds
review/text: I love white teas and have really enjoyed experimenting with different flavors through Teavana.  Youthberry, White Ayurvedic Chai and Spice of Life are a few of my favorites.  The description of ingredients for Frutto Bianco pearls seems heavenly: kiwi, coconut, and tropical fruit bits.  I read several customer reviews that equated their experience of drinking this tea to lying on a beach in Hawaii (which definitely enticed me!)  However, after thoroughly enjoying most other Teavana white teas, this one was a disappointment.  The aroma (one of my favorite things about these teas) was very mild and not altogether pleasant.  Once brewed, the flavor was just blah.  I only bought a few ounces of it, but it is still here 5 months later.  I am now mixing it up with my other teas just to use it up.  If you prefer a more mellow taste, this may be more appealing to you (and my 7 year old daughter does enjoy the aroma of this one).  Once nice thing about this tea are the "pearls," these white tea leaves are even more unprocessed than other forms and present as lovely round spheres which slowly unfurl once they are brewed.

review/text: Gold Mine Gum (24 2oz burlap bags of gold nugget bubble gum per box)<br /><br />Firstly, this company is fast and friendly.  They sent out the product when they said they would and even threw in a free sample of some jerky.<br /><br />Everyone loves the gum.  For older people it is a reminder of childhood.  A bit of happy nostalgia.<br /><br />I bought the product to send out with my voice reel as it has a wild west theme. It is perfect in the little canvass sacks and does just what I needed it to.  I shopped around a lot and this was the best price, including delivery.<br /><br />I will surely buy more when I run out.

review/summary: Reminds me of water skiing in the 70's
review/text: When I was younger this was always one of the main staples we had with us every trip. Nari Spiced Sardines and crackers...OMGoodness so good!!!  All the families that went did the same. NO matter if you were skiing in Shasta, or the Delta, or Berryessa, from mothers day on, oh it was a great moment when these got brought out, gone in seconds. They have not changed in all these years. Only difference is the way you open the can, much easier now. But now the Nari Spiced Sardines are heating even harder to find. I have seen many people post )in many sites) as to where they can find them, and it takes a while but you can find them. This is one site for them. No natter what one you get of NARI's brand, you are getting a great sardine, these have more good things for you then any fish out there. LOVE THEM. LOVE THEM!!! ENjoy them when you can. Cheers to you all!

review/summary: Best tasting sardines ever.........
review/text: This could have been 5 star but the company cannot provide the consumers the product as demanded, I found this kind of sardines at an Oriental store named Lee lee's at the Philippines aisle products together was it's sister brand that is only on tomatoe sauce only. But after getting some of the spiced version this store don't carry them no more due to lack of supplies, hence I end up asking the owner to order some of the Spiced Sardines Nuri  brand but it's been a while probably months that they don't have it no more or they stock small quantity and now can't find it nowhere.....Hence I looked for an alternative and I discovered a new one and thanks to Amazon.com, they always give you other options if you can't find the the product you wanted.....Try the Ramirez Spiced Portuguese Sardines......same taste and it's a lot cheaper...TRY IT.........and you've heard it first from me......

These are by far the best sardines I have had, and I look forward to ordering more to save for those special moments when I want my sardines to have flavor.  They are not too hot and the laurel and clove spices are so sensual, for a can of sardines, and puts these above all the other brands I love!

review/summary: This is the same as Passionfruit Pulp
review/text: As a child in Africa, I patiently waited for our granadilla vine to produce exotic flowers. Finally a fruit appeared and seemed to age on the vine as it developed a deep purple dimpled skin. Once ripe, the granadillas-or passion fruit-were cut in half and the golden fragrant pulp speckled with black seeds could be strained and used in a variety of desserts and drinks. Here is a favorite recipe using this product.<br /><br />2 (115-gram) cans sweetened granadilla pulp<br />1 cup freshly squeezed orange juice<br />2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice<br />1/4 cup orange blossom or clover honey<br />2 cups cold water<br />Lemon slices<br />Fresh mint sprigs<br /><br />1. Into a medium bowl, press the granadilla pulp through a sieve with the back of a dessert spoon. Scrape the pulp from<br />the underside of the sieve. Press the pulp from the top until<br />just the seeds remain, discard the seeds.<br /><br />2. Pour the granadilla juice into a glass jug. Strain in the orange and lemon juice, then stir in honey and water. Sweeten more to taste if needed. Ice will dilute the juice slightly.<br /><br />3. Fill 4 tall glasses with ice. Pour juice over ice and serve with a straw, lemon slice and fresh mint sprig.<br /><br />Makes 4 (8-ounce) servings.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Dissapointing...just another diet Big Red
review/text: I should preface this review by noting that I consider myself a Big Red connoisseur...I think I probably drank the stuff out of my baby bottle.  I really love the stuff, and grew up drinking it out of bottles, made ice cream out of it...you name it, I tried it.  However, as I get older I prefer not to consume quite so many calories if I can.  What can I say, there is nothing like the real thing.  I had hopes that the "zero" version might be closer to the actual sugary version, but not so (I do realize that most diet sodas taste nothing like their full-sugared counterparts, but I was hopeful).  It still tastes very much of artificial sweetener and I did not notice much of a difference between this and the plain old diet version.  Go for the real thing if you can!  Nonetheless, thank you Amazon for mailing soda to Hawaii!

review/text: These are wonderful.<br /><br />I keep a jar of chocolate covered espresso beans on my conference table.  I've bought from many different places with varying quality and consistency, these are hands-down the best I've found.  They keep a constant circulation of people in my office grabbing handfuls and visiting.  It takes only a few days to run through a 2lbs bag.<br /><br />This is a very high quality product.  The consistency of the bean size, the crunch and flavor of the bean, the chocolate coating thickness, the richness and smoothness of the chocolate, the perfect mixture of chocolate to coffee flavor - excellent.<br /><br />One note for the seller, and a caveat for the buy - I'm worried as Texas summer comes that the slow shipping method and small icepack will result in damaged product.  Please look at faster shipping!

review/summary: Illy is by far the best tasting espresso.
review/text: After having Illy at the espresso bars in Italy, well, no other espresso tasted good to me! Illy tastes great made in a good pump espresso machine. It also tastes great made in a steam espresso machine (e.g., a low end Krups) and a Moka (an Italian poor-man's espresso maker). The rich flavor isn't burnt tasting like many espresso roasts. Everyone I've made an Illy espresso for raves over the flavor compard to espresso from chain coffee stores.<br /><br />A tip when brewing espresso using a steam espresso machine:  Shut off the valve before any steaem comes through the coffee.  The high temperature steam will leach unwanted flavors into the coffee.<br /><br />I used to buy Illy at the local stores, but the prices were over $11 per can, sometimes $12. I was happy to see Amazon start carrying it at an even lower price.<br /><br />If you can't find Illy a good runner-up is Lavazza, however, its flavor isn't as intense as Illy.

review/summary: So far, my favorite pre-ground coffee
review/text: I'm comparing this to Lavazza Cafe Espresso and Lavazza In Blue.  I'm not a coffee guru...I can't really go in depth about the flavors, aromas, depth, etc....I can tell you that with Lavazza Cafe Espresso i get a palpable caffeine jolt from a 14 gram double espresso extracted over 20 seconds on my gaggia. Not really fond of the taste. I use Cafe Espresso for iced espressos and americanos. I can sort of taste some chocolate and nutty flavors, it does have a bit of a sweet taste, but it seems to have a lingering bitterness. Lavazza In Blue has a cleaner aftertaste and is more chocolatey. In Blue is a bit smoother as well. Illy Is my favorite, clean after taste, not bitter, smoother than both. Plus it seems to have a bit more caffeine kick...but i think that's just mental or maybe because i drink Illy as a straight shot. If you don't mind spending the money, I would buy Illy. If you find it ludicrous to spend $12 on 8 ounce coffee, which i doubt since you probably have a nice machine if you are reading this, I would buy Lavazza In Blue (i can get it for $8 at World Market). If you just want a preground espresso to make coffee drinks, or iced drinks and don't want to spend too much nor buy a burr grinder and grind your own, i would get the Lavazza Cafe Espresso. Still waiting to try Oro and Illy Dark roast.<br />Lavazza Cafe Espresso would get 3.5/5 from me. In Blue would get 4/5, Illy 4.5/5.

review/summary: Goodbye Starbucks, Hello illy.
review/text: I just got the Bialetti Milk and Espresso set and bought this coffee because it was recomended. It is the best coffee I have ever tasted in my life and I no longer need to go to Starbucks. I can make all those amazing drinks at home and mine are even better. I admit the cost is a bit much, but I pour the extra espresso and milk in a container and refrigerate for iced coffee drinks. So I never waste a drop. Also, the cans are neat looking and will make great cannisters in my kitchen cabinets. I love it so much I ordered another espresso/ milk set and more  of this coffee as a gift. I ordered 2 more cans for me too. It is expensive but worth every penny!!! If you still need help to rationalize the cost, I will tell you that i get a big double shot Mochaccino in the morning and one or two servigs of iced coffee later in the day from one tiny pot-6 oz i think.  I believe I got around 15 batches with one can. So figure what one trip to the coffee shop costs x your number of trips per week... uh huh staggering isnt it. So making great coffee at home acutally saves me money. Plus it is just incredibly good coffee. Much better than you can find anywhere else.

review/text: ATTENTION MOKA POT USERS: If you are looking for an illy espresso for your moka pot, this is NOT it.  Despite what other reviewers are saying, this "fine grind" is so very wrong for your Bialetti and it simply will not work.  The coffee will fall through the holes into the bottom reservoir and you'll end up with something that you really won't want to drink.  Learn from my mistake and go get yourself an illy Moka Grind or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DYTO">illy Caffe Normale Whole Bean</a> to grind yourself.<br /><br />With that said, this is great espresso.  I just don't know if my palate is sophisticated enough to make this worth the 2x premium over Lavazza.  If you're a die-hard espresso connoisseur, you'll probably feel like this is worth every penny.

review/text: This stuff is just fabulous, which is clearly why it gets top magazine ratings for Best Coffee AND why Illy can command such a high price even in this down market. Once you begin your day with it, nothing else seems to measure up.<br /><br />Note that the Illy USA website offers a 6 pack for a dollar less per can ( i.e. $ 78.00 for 6 ) than Amazon's current price for 2 cans - and ordered from Illy any order over $ 75.00 gets free S/H.  It would seem that Amazon should be able to get this price from Illy as well.<br /><br />[ Also Note: the title of this review is coffee-type specific given as labeled on the can itself, since this is the only Illy coffee i have tried. ]

review/summary: Exceptional espresso
review/text: Illy medium grind espresso is perhaps the best espresso or coffee I have ever tasted. I consider myself a coffee connoisseur, and I usually frequent all local coffee shops at any place I visit. My journey started with Nescafe instant when I was a teen, progressed to Starbucks (can't handle the burnt aftertaste), Peets, Green Moutain,etc, found temporary nirvana with Lavazza which I still have time to time, and found permanent nirvana with the Illy brand. The espresso is foamy, smooth, has a wonderful body and just plain delicious. It prompted me to invest in a Gaggia espresso machine just so I can make it at home everyday, and it has become a morning ritual. I enthusiastically recommend this coffee (preferably the medium grind, not the dark grind) if you are a true coffee lover.

review/summary: The best coffee in the world for the serious coffee drinker!
review/text: If you enjoy a fantastic cup of well roasted (not over-roasted) coffee, then this is for you.  An ultrafine, delicate grind, almost like baby powder, with no waste.  Just pure concentrate of perfect coffee.  I do not work for Illy or Amazon, but simply love my morning cup.<br />Anyway, if you have struggled to find the perfect coffee, as I have, look no further.  In my opinion, this is the most consistantly delicious coffee I've ever had. It comes pressurized in nitrogen I believe, to assure it's freshness.  It is very potent, as the fine grind is intended for use in an espresso maker.  I however, use it in my drip coffee maker with spring water and a paper filter, at about two-thirds the usual strength of a standard drip grind.  Buy some for you, or as a gift for your favorite coffee addict friend. Enjoy!!

review/text: I was first introduced to Illy in Paris. My friend used it in a drip coffee maker and I couldn't believe how smooth it was, whether the scoop as level or heaping. Stronger maybe, but just as smooth. Moved on to Italy and would only hit coffee bars with the Illy insignia. Could only find it in the Italian North End in Boston, nowhere else. Finally, finally, it started showing up at Whole Foods and I started to buy it again. I've had Kona, I've had Jamaican Blue Mountain- they don't hold a candle to Illy. I use the expresso fine grind in my auto drip. I just use a paper filter and let it go a few minutes over the finished brew alarm because it's so finely ground, it's a slow drip. But it's worth it! I'm not taking a chance with the medium ground for the auto drip. I don't want to muck around with perfection.<br /><br />Introduced it to a special person this summer and I think I can honestly say, I've added a smidgeon to his quality of life.

review/summary: The. Best. Coffee. In. The. World. Period.
review/text: I think the headline says it all.<br /><br />Simply put, I've never had better coffee in my home. With a BUNN machine (Thermos-carafe style) and the filters that fit the BUNN properly, Illy espresso is perfectly brewed every single time. Upon sipping the first cup in the morning I actually say (out loud!) "Ah, great coffee!"<br /><br />Pricy, yes. But SO worth it.

review/summary: good coffee
review/text: If you like Starbucks, you will love Illy. :) Much better aroma, but similar style (more-or-less over-burnt).<br />My wife prefers it to Lavazza, and I have to oblige. If I were single, I would stick to Lavazza: great aroma, not over-burnt and half the price.

review/summary: Great espresso, Best Price
review/text: Once I tried Illy, everything else tasted just OK.  Truly an excellent coffee flavor - smooth, not bitter of overly strong.  And the price is lower than any store I've check and even better than ordering directly from Illy.  At a price of $13 per can, I was ordering five cans at a time to get free shipping.  I love that I only have to order two at a time and it's delivered to my door!
