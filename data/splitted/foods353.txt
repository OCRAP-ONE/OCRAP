review/summary: Maybe too good, cats don't want anything else!
review/text: We occasionally feed a couple stray cats as they are good at keeping the mice and snakes away. Once in awhile we will give them some of these Temptations Cat Treats and they are crazy about them! They will only eat the regular cat food if their efforts at getting more of the Temptations Treats doesn't work. One of them will sit at the door and meow and meow but eventually goes and eats the regular food. We have tried all the different varieties of Temptations Treats and they don't have a preference, they like all of them. If you want something to really great to give your cat, try any variety of the Temptations Cat Treats but be prepared for your cat to start begging for these all the time. The one thing we cannot tell is how good nutritionally these are for cats, the package says 100% nutritionally complete but not sure what that means in this case. Even if you could feed a cat these alone, that would be way too expensive so for now I will balance a few treats with regular varieties of dry cat food.

review/summary: Buy At Your Own Risk; Cat Will Choose TREATS Over YOU : )
review/text: Well, here I am, buying my SECOND 12-pack of these treats.<br /><br />My Egyptian Mau is absolutely NUTS over these and has treat time pegged to two 5-minute windows of time each day.<br /><br />These are great hard-coated treats and my cat loves them like no other.  These packs are the same 3 ounce size I used to buy at the grocery store & every one has been fresh and in excellent condition.  Amazon's Subscribe & Save price is much lower than the local stores' prices.<br /><br />You know what they say:  "Dogs Have Owners.  Cats Have Staff."<br /><br />Maybe he needs his own Amazon account?  No, that would be too dangerous.  I can see a garage filled to the brim with cat toys and a house furnished with nothing but cat trees, live birds, and bowls of goldfish...<br /><br />Try these treats; you won't be disappointed (and neither will your cat, which may be most important)!

review/summary: Excellent cat treats
review/text: I've been buying cat treats for many years. Of the brands and types that are still on the market, I find that Whiskas Temptations is the one treat that all cats love. They come in several flavors. My cats like the Hearty Beef and Turkey flavors best. Pricing can be an issue as I have noticed continual price increases in this product for the last few years. Shop around and get them where you find the best price. Currently, the best price is about $1.35 per 3 oz. bag. But I,ve seen them at prices up to around $2 per bag.

review/summary: Cat's are fickel
review/text: My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.

They get the best food, and now thanks to "Temptation" the best treats.  All they need to get now is a JOB!

The fine print on the package says that it should not be used on kittens less than 6 months of age.  I didn't notice this until after I bought and opened the package.  Hopefully, they'll stay fresh for another 2 months.

I then put them in the cubbard and I found her in the cubbard one day crying to get out. Its insane. She acts like someone on crack. Im starting to question what they put in these. Is there really a lot of regulation regarding cat snacks. I doubt it. Ive tried to stop giving them to her but she then turns her back to me and pouts for days to weeks on end. It has taken me a while to figure out what was going on with her and I have narrowed it down to these Temptation snacks. Im concerned about what drugs they put in these.

review/text: I found these in a local Petco and decided to try them with my friend's cat. The cat has gone crazy for these things! I've never seen this cat walk around on two legs, try to climb my arm to get to the treat in my hand, or reach into a bag to try to get to the contents before I gave her some of these. The name is very fitting, but the real temptation is for we humans to keep giving just *one* more treat to the cat over and over again to enjoy the fun reactions.

review/summary: My cat goes bananas for Temptations
review/text: I have a very tall, lean, long-legged male cat. He doesn't eat much. I put out the finest wet food and he shows barely any interest. I buy expensive dry food to supplement his main meals. Eh, he could take or leave it. I even tried giving him high-end tuna from a can--the kind people eat--and he hardly nibbled at it. He just doesn't have much of an appetite, or so I thought. When I sprinkle a handful of these treats on a napkin, he furiously eats them all up. When I open the cabinet where I keep them, he comes running from wherever he is in the house. He seems to like all the flavors equally (chicken, beef, salmon - doesn't matter). Temptations is the only food I can count on his eating on a consistent basis. I could never train him or manipulate him with food before because nothing ever motivated him. These treats motivate him. If I need to calm him down for a brushing or a nail trimming, Temptations will work the magic. Thank you, Temptations.

Little did I know this would backfire and they would elicit a desired behavior in ME!<br /><br />Not only do they LOVE these (and a couple of other flavors), they have now learned when it 10pm, which is treat time and time to leave the bedroom.<br /><br />By 930pm the vultures are starting the circle me on bed while staring at me; at 945 they start to softly vocalize; by 10pm they hoist me on their little backs and carry me to the drawer where the treats live while in full complaining voice.  I obey and give them an equal number of treats in the hallway, quickly locking the bedroom door behind me. Why lock it?  We have lever type doorhandles and the male has learned to open the bedroom since "Treat Time" started, will march back in and demand more.<br /><br />Did Dr Frankenstein realized the monster he created?

review/summary: Does wonders for bad breath
review/text: We adopted a neighborhood cat a few months ago. She is very nice, but had horrible breath even after we started feeding her various special cat foods. Otherwise great cat, but when she would yawn in your lap, you had to fight fainting.<br /><br />We took "Dentabites" more for fun since our cat loved other whiskas tempations we tried with her, but well, thought let's try to see if it really can do anything about her breath. After about a week of giving her dentabites, we noticed her breath "improved" and after 2 weeks it was amazing. Her bad breath is almost completely gone, or gone as much as it can without brushing teeth i suppose. We didn't change anything in her diet at the time so we were pretty sure it was dentabites that did the job. Also, since then, we've been feeding her various foods but keep the dentabites snacks and bad breath hasn't returned... one more point to be sure that Dentabites really work.<br /><br />Really great product. Just a few treats a day make enormous difference. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Cats love, I only like...
review/text: Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.

review/summary: RUIN YOUR LIFE
review/text: I innocently started giving these to my cats - had no idea they would begin to control my life.  Run out of treats?  you're screwed.  One cat cries so loud in the morning it sounds like someone is torturing her.  Eventually, the other cat jumps up on my face to wake me up...for treats.  It's like I'm living in a nightmare if I don't give them their fix.  C'mon...we know big corporations put addictive substances in candy, sodas & chips - - - of course they're in our cat treats.  And, seriously....they've hit the kitty crack jackpot w/ these.  Do yourself & your cat a favor:  Save your mental & your cat's physical HEALTH.

review/summary: Hairball reducer AND soft fur all in one!
review/text: My 13 year old cat has never liked cat treats.  I have tried a variety over the years, and she wouldn't have anything to do with them.  Until I found this one.  I was really happy to finally find something to reward her, or get her to come to me when called.  These treats have petroleum in them.  My cat loves Vaseline, so it makes sense that she likes these.  I have noticed a decrease in the frequency of her throwing up.  The great surprise that I found is that her fur has become softer!  I know it must be the petroleum in these that is coating her fur as well.  I have to feed her a special cat food because she has a tendancy towards the urinary tract infection, and since I have been doing that, her fur has been more coarse and dry.  These treats have brought back the softness to her fur.  I'm sold, and I will be buying these from now one.  My very picky cat loves them!

review/text: My four cats adore this.  They split one bag every night.  I mistakenly gave some  to a stray cat that I feed and he would not leave the deck until I gave him a whole bag.  My mother's cat is also addicted and requires a hand full every day.  She stares pointedly between my mother and her food bowl until she gets enough.<br /><br />Since one my cats has some dental problems this cat food is great as a treat that is good for them.

review/text: These are truly temptations for our cats and will have them running from any side of the house.  When you open the bag, they actually smell like "french fries" (two of us confirm this) so the smell from the human side is not bad.  We have tried so many other treats but the Whiskas Temptations Chicken flavor are definitely a favorite.<br /><br />They can put weight on your cat quickly and certainly are not meant to be a diet.  But for treats, they are great and our cats really love them.  If our 5 love them, the chances are high that your cats will love them too!

review/text: I've been giving these to my 2 cats everyday after I give them wet food so that their teeth can be somewhat cleaned afterwards. They love the flavor, though after such a long time they're growing weary of the taste. It's well known that cats who eat too much wet food without eating anything crunchy after are prone to tooth decay. This is just one product that can help cut down on long-term dental health issues with your feline.<br /><br />The only downside to this product is that it only comes in 1 flavor; my cats want variety. Do yours?

My cats also love Party Mix, does that mean they are drugged product.<br /><br />That being said please do not listen to non-scence on these ratings.<br /><br />My cats do love these temptations... They do not beg for them,,,, but they do like them!<br /><br />I feed them each 10 treats at home at a time, the suggested ammount and of course they could go for more (because it is a snack)...<br /><br />I love that these taste good to the cats but they are also very healthy!!!!<br /><br />I have 7 cats. One of my cats will only eat 4-5 treats and she gets FULL easy and the rest can eat ALL that I put down........ My neighbor sais that her cats do not like them because they are spoiled on "people food"... I was shocked when she returned the bag I sent them for Christmas!<br /><br />I tried to get them to eat them also and they walked away, tried to also put one in there mouth...<br /><br />I also have 35 cats in our shelter and they ALL love these treats, they will eat as many as you give them.... We cannot afford to buy these for them all the time but we get it for them every few months.. We keep them all the time for our own cats!<br /><br />They are a great product, I like to buy the large bags because you are saving money!

review/summary: Why can't I buy these in Canada!?
review/text: I bought these when I was in the States (I live in Canada), and now my cat has a monkey on his back...and I can't buy them here! :(  And not only can I not buy them in Canada, I can't even order them on Amazon for reasons I don't fully understand. What am I going to do? His Royal Majesty (I mean the cat, of course) MUST have his Catnip Temptations! He's addicted. I can't drive down there in the winter when the roads are bad (like right now). He doesn't forget about them. It doesn't matter if I hide them. He knows. He watches me. He watches everyone who he thinks might give him his treats. I'm down to the last bag. I need...I need a Catnip Temptations dealer. Or I need to send him to Catnip Temptations Rehab.

After they have their Temptations I can have my coffee. Guess who rules this<br />house.<br />I get my Temptations from Amazon. It is so handy.

review/summary: My cat loves it.. I don't know if I do.
review/text: Bought a pack of these since I saw them on sale at my local grocer and we were running out of his usual treats. Once I opened it, my cat came running. I'm thinking he could smell it from across the room. I gave him one and it disappeared instantly, and he looked up right away and begged for more. I gave him a few more and put it away but he would not stop begging until I gave him more. One more, that's it. I put it away again and my cat got all feisty and testy with me. He started biting my empty fingers until I gave in again!<br /><br />I don't really like how it unleashes the BEAST in my sweet cat, but I can tell he loves it. It's like a drug even! With that said, I don't think I'll buy another pack for him. He loved his old treats but it never made him go crazy. There must be some kind of MSG-equivalent in these treats that makes them beg for more. I've never seen him act so ravenous after getting a treat.

Don't get me wrong they love this flavor, but I don't think it is the best flavor you can buy.<br /><br />Temptations is most likely the best treat brand you can buy though, they never fail. Just shake the bag, and look, I have cats!

review/text: I didn't have very high expectations for these treats when I first bought them - we were just out of their other treats and I thought I'd give these a shot. Not only do our cats love them, but we've seen a huge difference in the amount of hairballs from our two furballs. We used to have hairball messes to deal with many times a week, and now it's down to just a few a month. I've now put these on our Subscribe & Save list to make sure we never run out. I love that I am giving them something they love that also happens to be so good for their insides. And as a huge bonus, we have a lot fewer messes to clean up/step in. We all win!

I am thinking about trying her on the tuna flavor next since she loves tuna so much.

review/summary: Kitty Crack
review/text: All three of my cats are crazy about these.  They like the salmon and tuna flavors best. They all beg for them in one way or another.  One cat will sit and stare at me and if that doesn't work, he'll curl up on my shoulder and purr as loud as he can. Another one of my cats just bops me with his paw to let me know he wants treats.  The more I ignore him, the harder he hits me.  I eventually have to tell him no, because I don't want to overdo it with the treats. Anyway, they all love them and I've noticed silkier coats since adding these to their diet.

review/text: Crunchy addiction<br /><br />I treat my cats to 8 different Temptations flavors, and they love them all.  I'm sure that giving them different flavors means more to me, than it does to my cats; they don't seem to chew them long enough to taste them.  But they insist on two or three each time they come in the house, I'm sure it's a form of addiction.  I'm buying these on the "Subscribe & Save" program, which save money and time compared to buying them locally.<br /><br />Cats love these things!

For around $20 for 12-3oz packs is such a good deal, and the treats keep very well if you don't open them.

review/summary: Whiskas Temptations Hairball Control Chicken Flavour Treats for Cat
review/text: With four cats in the household hairballs are a given. It got to be an almost daily routine to hear and see one or more of them gagging and coughing, trying to get rid of a build up of hair in their system. Why their digestive tracts haven't evolved to handle this problem over thousands of years mystifies me. Not only do they groom themselves, they also groom each other.<br /><br />We've tried several different products to try to alleviate this problem and nothing helped. Then we came across the Temptations treats. They have helped considerably. The cats seem to relish them, not knowing they're being given "medicine". Whilst the treats haven't completely ended the hairball issue they have been a great help. Now, it can be weeks if not months without any hairballs.<br /><br />If your cats have a problem with hairballs then give this product a try.<br /><br />Also, with Amazon's Subscribe and Save you'll save money.

review/text: These things are made of magic and rainbows. I'm not sure what the manufacturing process is but it probably involves unicorns.<br /><br />In all seriousness, try these. These are hands down the best sugar free hard candies I've ever had and probably one of the best hard candies I've had, period. 10 calories apiece, great creamy taste, texture is fine, no weird aftertastes or undertones or anything. The only thing I could POSSIBLY complain about is they could stand to be a little more chocolatey, but basically on a scale of one to ten these are amazing. I wish they were more widely available in brick and mortar stores!
