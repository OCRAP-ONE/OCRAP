review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: Great and as advertised. Item was shipped on time and the material is pretty good. Have bought many more again. I use this on the Senseo machine.  you need to use the  larger pod holder and 'pack' with your hands around it once place so no water scapes from the sides. Recommend this item.

review/summary: great coffee, BIG pods
review/text: This is our favorite creme brulee. It's a dark roast, sweet, smooth and so so good. Use a double pod holder(which came standard with the Senseo Deluxe model coffee machine), the pods are big and don't fit well in a single pod holder.

review/summary: Light and refreshing
review/text: This is a great matcha if you're looking for a refreshing flavor.  It's a bit like apple juice actually, only it tastes healthier in a good way.  :)  The matcha is vibrant and light and the apple is more like a combination of real apple and candy apple.  Quite nice.  There is something a bit off with the flavoring.  It has a bit of chemical flavor, but it is not too bad.  I still enjoyed this.

review/summary: A Matcha A Day Keeps The Doctor Away
review/text: So I am mightly impressed with matcha. For a few weeks now, I've been having a cup almost daily, and I have to say I'm seeing benefits. I don't know if it can all be blamed on the matcha, but the matcha is the only real change I've made recently. When a tea company makes claims about the healthiness of their teas and how this tea will make you skinny or that tea will calm your anger, I tend to just laugh it off. Just another marketing ploy, I mean, really, it's just tea. It's delicious and better for you than soda (if you don't weigh it down with tons of sugar and cream like I used to do), but it's still just tea, not some magic potion that's going to solve all of your problems.<br /><br />Well. Since matcha came into my life, I'm more alert (obviously) and my system seems...cleaner. I don't feel bogged down by the terrible foods I sometimes indulge in, and somehow my system seems less responsive to my dairy allergy. Don't get me wrong, it still makes me sick, but it's not the gut-wrenching "I'm gonna die" feeling I'm used to, it's more of a "Oh man, I forgot and ate dairy again". On the whole, I just feel healthier. Which is awesome. Everyone can afford to feel a little bit healthier, am I right?<br /><br />Anyway, this tea smells amazing. Like juicy Granny Smith apples, sweet and tart all at the same time. I want to dip this tea in caramel. The flavor is perfect. It's exactly what I expected this tea to taste like. It's very juicy, my mouth is watering after every sip, and it's tart without being stomach-turning sour. I am having a really hard time not adding some of my Red Leaf Tea Caramel matcha to this. They're just begging to be blended. In college, I was big fan of the Caramel Apple shot, which is basically one part sour apple Pucker to one part butterscotch Schnapps. This seems like a good alternative for me to take to work and not get fired! Though now I'm wondering about matcha cocktails...<br /><br />I love these matchas that are encouraging me to mix and match, play with different blends, bake...I love it! I wish I had the time to just lock myself in my kitchen with my matchas and experiment to my little heart's content.

review/summary: oo strong mint!
review/text: Mint mint mint! This is my review of how to love mint matcha!<br />First of all - they're both green! That helps with that feeling of "I'm drinking a strawberry flavoured drink but it's green instead of red! Ow my brain!"<br /><br />It freshens your breath! Don't do what I do and make your matcha way too strong - otherwise associations of swallowing mouth wash come to mind. Oops!<br /><br />It's classy! Think of cr&egrave;me de menthe. Okay cr&egrave;me de menthe way be a little old fashioned, but it still hits the spot when you sip from crystal glasses. Drink this matcha from a crystal bowl! Now you're fancy too!<br /><br />It's great for cookies! Peppermint shortbread is one of my favourite Christmas cookie flavours. Nobody will blink at a red and green cookie - so go for it!<br /><br />It's a perfect mixer! I know this is a strange and unorthodox review, but this is finally the part when I drink the matcha and love it! Chocolate mint my friends.  I mixed a healthy dose (1/2 tsp) of Belgium Chocolate matcha with a small amount (1/4 tsp) of mint matcha! The mint is quite strong, but after experimenting I've found this to be my favourite mix. For an extra treat I add the matcha right into warm milk and froth it up!<br /><br />It is delish and reminds me of an After Eight hot chocolate. If that's not a treat, I don't know what is!

review/summary: Great tea!
review/text: This was my first time ordering from Red Leaf Tea. Everything went very smoothly and my order arrived super fast.<br /><br />In the fall, I love the mint lattes offered at the coffee shops. When I stumbled upon this, it sounded too good to be true.  I could make a yummy mint matcha latte at home? That's unpossible!  But no, it's true. It took me a few attempts to get the proportions just right, but when I did, all I can say is mmmmm!  To turn it into a latte, I add vanilla soy milk after mixing the matcha with warm water.  The end result is very creamy and mint-y and one of the best teas I've had. I've also tried mixing in some cocoa powder to make a chocolate mint matcha latte, and that was very delicious too. I think I have a new fall obsession.<br /><br />Even though mint is more of a fall flavor for me, I think because the mint in this is so smooth, it would also taste great iced. If I have any left by spring, I'm definitely going to try it, and also buy some bubble gum flavored matcha to mix in with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all mint tea lovers!

review/summary: MmmmmmMINT!
review/text: MMmmmmmMINT Matcha is JUST what I needed to help round off my matcha supply!<br /><br />I love mint but need to be in the mood for it. Luckly for me that mood comes fairly often!<br /><br />Mint is eye opening, awakening, and also helps soothe a troubled tummy.<br /><br />We had some really good Japanese food last night at a great restaurant but all of us were having some tummy "issues" last evening after dinner. This mornings mint matcha is really helping to settle the tummy woes.<br /><br />When I opened my bag from Red Leaf Tea the aroma was striking! I instantly thought "ohhhh yessss this is IT". It had some slight resemblance to Spearmint gum, and while I do detect a slight peppermint flavor here I would have to say the mint used is mostly spearmint. For those who know their mints some really prefer one type of mint over another. Spearmint to me is sweeter than peppermint and there is less of a bite to it. Some may beg to differ since most people are used to peppermint candies but in its true form I find peppermint to have more bite, sharper than spearmint and spearmint more sweet naturally. Regardless of what type of mint you prefer I have to say this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf does in fact taste very natural!<br /><br />Yet at the same time it is an excellent mixer as well. Of course you will want to use a little less mint matcha in your blend along with another matcha but I choose to blend mint with mocha this morning. The mocha I used a full scoop and the mint just a half of a scoop. I can taste the mocha very well and the mint does not totally over power it.<br /><br />This mint does not in any way taste like mouth wash or toothpaste. It is quite enjoyable. I am so glad that I purchased this one and will absolutely keep this as a stash regular.<br /><br />Also I notice that the mocha base is providing a nice creamy backdrop to the mint matcha! Ohhhh I MUST try a french vanilla / mint blend as soon as possible - I am thinking "Grasshopper" flavored matcha here! Oh yeah!<br /><br />So all in all I could not be happier that I went for it and grabbed this Mint Matcha from Red Leaf!

review/summary: A Shamrock whatnow?
review/text: Ah mint. My wife and I both adore mint, but I'm a spearmint girl, where she's a peppermint lover. And these are two very different mints.<br /><br />But I have love in my heart for mint teas. My childhood summers were fueled by Lipton tea bags with fresh mint set out on the porch to brew in the sun. Picking mint and just chewing on it as we played in the sun. Heck, my college days were fueled by mint juleps and raspberry mojitos. Mint and I are good, good friends. And a Shamrock Shake is a must-have for me every March! At least, it was until I found out about my dairy allergy.<br /><br />Which is what brought me to this tea, Mint Matcha, a desire to make my own version of the Shamrock Shake (which is essentially a vanilla-mint milkshake from McDonalds) with vanilla and mint matchas and soy milk or ice cream. But for the sake of this review, I'm drinking this matcha the way I drink all my tea, no milk and some sugar.<br /><br />Earlier today I made a cup of this for a friend of my wife's, who I am eagerly trying to seduce to the ways of matcha with my Red Leaf Tea collection,  and I fell in love the second I opened the package. It smells like a smooth creamy mint. When I commented on how good it smells, my wife agreed with me...and she doesn't even like matcha! I can't wait to have a cup of this myself!<br /><br />My wife's friend (who needs to be on Steepster, darn it!) says this tea tastes like Christmas (which may have something to do with the Rudolph travel mug I sent it to her in!). This made me think of my favorite tea of all time, Santa's Secret, which is a vanilla-mint black tea, so I have high hopes for this one.<br /><br />Holy mint, batman! This is definitely a peppermint tea, with just a hint of the smoothness that reminds me of spearmint tea. Wow. I am definitely craving a raspberry-mint matcha mojito now. Yum, yum, yum. It's mega minty in a non medicinal way and now I am dying to try it with the vanilla, but if I have any more matcha today, I'm going to explode XD. I love it! The burst of strong mint really helps wake you up too, and can definitely see myself adding this to my collection. And mint mixes so well with berries and fruit that I can see endless smoothie options here. If you're a mint fan, I definitely recommend this one.

review/summary: Great BBQ sauce
review/text: Virginia Gentlemen BBQ sauce is good on its own (just a little bit of heat and not too sweet). It's also good as a starting point if you want to mix up your own hot sauce. Sometimes spicy sauces can be all heat and no depth, or the heat occludes the sauce's personality. Mix it with some VG and you'll get a kicking sauce with lots of depth. We smoke briskets a lot during the summer and VG is a must have for those dinners. Slather some on white bread with thin sliced onions and sliced Claussen pickles, top with tender brisket and you've got a little heaven on earth. Divine!

I am wondering if these packages are seconds that were singled out at the factory as not deliverable to retail grocery stores.<br /><br />I have trouble getting these at the local grocery store because they keep running out of stock!  I almost send them back to Amazon, but too much hassle.  Won't buy them again from Amazon!

review/summary: Not quite light
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by this beer, so many like to refer to as "carbonated piss". I find regular Bud all right to begin with. But Platinum is more decent actually. A little too carbonated and on the light side indeed, but you only borderline know it's a light beer. You get some of the full flavored beer's aftertaste, and it's slightly sweet, but just enough. Totally drinkable. This beer passes the "drink it at room temperature" test. Some OK beers you can only drink chilled. Platinum goes good at room temp. too because it's a decent beer as I mentioned.<br /><br />Getting wasted factor is actually prominent with this beverage- 4 of these give you a warm welcome to La-la land. On an empty stomach you might get launched to outer space with 3. All of you folks new to alcohol consumption- I will not be glorifying the process here, but will caution you instead- more than 3 bottles take you to barf-land. Excess of this beverage consumption fore-gos the game of toilet scare. Leave extreme out of drinking this Bud.<br /><br />And now, some information for us flabby bustards who likes number: this beer is not quite light in getting drunk and it's not quite light on calories either. Platinum's only 8 calories lass than regular 5%ABV Bud bottle at 137 calories, which is more than Bud Dry(a better beer than regular Bud with 130 calories). Not much help for the big gut fighting task force here. Still from all the light beers this one is the strongest by far at 6%ABV. And for some drinking a six pack of Michelob produces the best same effect as drinking buttermilk.<br /><br />The horrible morning factor after drinking Platinum is minimized- you have to drink 5 or go for the whole six pack to wake up with the bell-head. This beer hydrates you well and is light so you are not all "hopped" up and heavy in the body or the head after it.<br /><br />Bottom line- let me know if you find a better light beer, whether you drink it for taste or to get wasted, or both.

review/summary: I want it back!
review/text: This beverage is becoming harder and harder to find.  I have been drinking the International Coffees since I hit adulthood around 20, and it is my only real addiction. No smokes, no booze, just let me have a cup of this if I'm going to work, and an extra cup if I'm not.<br /><br />For serious coffee drinkers, this is NOT strong, it's very sweet, and each flavor is different enough that most of them don't mix well (for example, if you have two partial cans of two different flavors, you are better off just drinking two half cups of coffee than mixing them, unless your sense of taste is somewhat blunted.<br /><br />French Vanilla and Vanilla Caramel are my faves, and I cannot find them on store shelves!  Maxwell House bought the chain from G.Foods, and I allowed time for the transition (sadly, they went to plastic from metal cans, but if it had kept the coffee available, I'd still buy it).  What I have, I bought from Amazon's third parties.<br /><br />You can still get surplus sugar-free (but why?  Go drink a glass of water!) or even worse, decaffeinated.  Suisse Mocha shows up once in awhile, and even though it is more cocoa-ish, I drink it if it's all I can get.<br /><br />Oh, please, let's bring this product back to wider circulation!  I have a serious jones for the stuff.  Expensive?  Yes, compared to other packaged coffee, but NOT compared to a couple of lattes a day.

review/summary: Use Zoe for baking
review/text: Zoe is made from big fat olives that are meaty and buttery tasting. When my husband and I went to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company in Pittsburgh, PA, the olive oil buyer guided us through our first olive oil purchase. She had us eat the olives that went into different kinds of olive oil and then pick the olives we liked best. Our first purchase of Zoe was the result. It is an olive oil with a distinctly buttery taste. I use it in baking cakes whenever oil or melted butter is called for. It tastes great! Absolutely great! Plus, it's heart healthy, which butter is not. Sigh. Other olives, particularly Italian olives that are made into olive oil are very peppery. Hence, their oil is peppery. This might be what other people are talking about when they say they don't like Zoe. Zoe is not a bit peppery. So please, you must try for yourself in this case. It is not a good idea to take anyone else's product review for olive oil to heart. (a pun!) You must decide what you like in an olive oil and buy according. Also, I want to mention that the buttery taste stays there even through a saute. We bought different types of Italian olive oil in smaller bottles that same first time at the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company, and then we came home and made fried eggs with all of them. In that venue the taste of the olive oils really came through and Zoe kept that buttery taste. Good eating!

As you can imagine, I've ended up with some really lacking oils. Not so with Zoe Organic! This olive oil is light and mild with an excellent clean taste that doesn't overpower the flavor of what you're cooking (I like that in an olive oil!). Perfect for salad dressings, sauteing, baking, etc. There's nothing I wont use this oil in. Another plus is the size, no more trying to find a cabinet space tall enough for a tall bottle of oil. I've finally found an affordable winner!

The green pouring spout is accessed by pulling a ring pull which is very hard to pry up. Then it takes considerable pulling to expand the pour spout. The cap then unscrews however it is very hard to pour without a large amount of residue accumulating on the top of the container.<br />I recommend the oil but also recomment decanting it into another container or pouring bottle.

review/text: I bought this olive oil since it was organic, and went through 6 (750 mL) cans on a subscription, but in the end I decided to stop buying it. I bought this oil to be my basic mid-priced olive oil primarily for sauteing. I like all sorts of olive oil -- from soft and buttery to peppery and green. This oil has a heavy woody scent, not as fragrant as other good EVOO in this price range. Sampled uncooked, the oil has mild initial taste, not much olive flavor at all, but not unpleasant, but what I didn't like is its harsh after-taste. It was not good in salad dressings. With other flavorings, the harshness is muted but still remains. In cooked dishes any olive oil flavor mostly disappears. In the same price range, I've had better luck with obscure Spanish or Greek 1 L cans of EVOO from the supermarket.

review/summary: Almost perfect organic olive oil
review/text: The price and quality of this product are both fantastic. I love that the dark, tin container greatly protects the taste and integrity of the oil (versus the typical glass bottle). However, there is an inherent problem with the pouring spout. It is plastic and very short. This leads to oil dripping on the top during usage, which is both wasteful and messy. If the manufacturer would alter that one component, this would be the perfect organic olive oil.

review/summary: Regular Non-Organic Zoe EVOO tastes better
review/text: As you can see by my name, I am a green, organic mom blogger, and always try to shop accordingly.  I was already a big fan of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5DZU2">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1-Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and was glad to see an organic version.  Unfortunately, though how much we tried to like this, the organic Zoe Organic EVOO just doesn't taste anywhere near as good as the non-organic variety.  This organic one definitely tastes like it's made from a whole different variety of olives, leaving it with a pronounced sharper, greener flavor with a bit of a bite.  It's very distinct, and totally overpowers my cooking.  The non-organic Zoe EVOO doesn't do this; it blends in perfectly as a marinade, for dipping bread, drizzling as a final touch on cooked dishes, etc.  So, unfortunately, in this case, go with the non-organic, which I have on Subscribe & Save reorder, and is a pantry staple in our house.

review/summary: Mellow taste, good buy.  Is there BPA in these containers?
review/text: I like that the Zoe olive oil comes in the metal containers, as opposed to plastic.  The packaging was good; there was not the slightest dent in either can.<br /><br />But there's the BPA thing.  Buying organic, you'd like to know there's not any bpa in the lining of the can, lurking there for months, canceling out part of the benefit of organic.  If Zoe does not tell us, we have to assume the bpa is there, as in other canned foods.  I did a casual search but wasn't able to find out anything specific for Zoe on this. The same casual search turned up many questions about bpa, no definitive answers.<br /><br />I did find a 2003 government sponsored scientific study --- [...] that found BPA was taken up by (absorbed into) olive oil in greater amounts than either water or 3% acetic acid!  Apparently, BPA links with lipid molecules very easily.<br /><br />Why can't we be sure, 8 years later, that BPA isn't leaching into food?  Unfortunately, I found that study link AFTER I'd bought these two tins, so the only thing to do is tranfer contents into glass and refrigerate.  I always keep olive oil refrigerated after opening anyway, in spite of the inconvenience when it solidifies and you have to pour warm water over the container to get it to pour.<br /><br />There's the pouring problem...  I'd read reviews beforehand, so I knew that you had to pull on the green tab to raise the plastic spout.  However, I usually don't pour much at one time, so am still getting a bit of dribble onto the top of the can.  So the plastic spout isn't working for me.  I'm considering glass containers such as the Global Amici drizzlers, just for pouring; this must be a common problem with olive oil.<br /><br />I can't detect anything buttery about Zoe Organic's taste.  And it's not as olive-like a taste as Colavita, for example.<br /><br />Next time, organic or not, I'll try something else for more flavor and to use as a dipping oil.  I'd consider the Zoe special varieties, but apparently they come in plastic containers, with no BPA disavowal in the descriptions.  With so many plastic items being imported from places with little manufacturing controls, it's not sure that any disavowal could be trusted, anyway.

review/summary: Disappointed in price change
review/text: Amazon just cancelled the 1L 2-pack of this good oil via subscribe & save @ 18.71 for my last shipment. That is 67 oz's of oil. Now it's 51 oz's for 22$ in subscribe & save, that is an increase from 0.28$ per OZ to 0.43$ per oz -- about 30% increase in price. Not anywhere as good a deal as it was before. This is good middle of the road, organic olive oil, been using it for last 2-3 years. But it's getting way to pricey for what it is.<br /><br />Maybe it's not Amazon - maybe it's the supplier price increase -- but it is a sad turn of events.<br /><br />Just read a bunch of articles about how low olive oil prices are hurting europe -- sounds like gouging to me.

review/text: The only other olive oil I can compare this to is "Filippo Berio" from the supermarket. I did a smell and taste test comparing these two oils. The supermarket stuff smelled awful and nothing like olives, while the Zoe had a nice olive scent to it. The supermarket stuff tasted nothing like olives while the Zoe did.<br /><br />Not a great comparison, but definitely a good buy if you can get it on sale or with coupons.

review/summary: A quality oil
review/text: I have been using olive oil for many years, even in sweet baked goods.  A couple of years ago the New Yorker magazine contained an article exposing all of the problems with Italian olive oils in recent years.  So I decided to switch to a Spanish olive oil, preferably organic.  Zoe ended up being my choice, mostly based on price and its fairly middle of the road flavor.  I have now been using it for about five years and remain satisfied.  It is not the best olive oil around, but it is consistently good and not priced so high as to cause pain.  I have not had problems with it going rancid.  I like the tin, but am still careful to keep it in a cool area rather than near the stove.  Once I have used half of the can's contents I prefer to decant the rest into a smaller, dark glass container.  I can't say that I love the spigot, but once I figured out how to pull it out I have had no problems.  The product stays in the tin or pours nicely into the dish or pot I am using when cooking.  I have not had any counter messes nor do I find a lot of oil around the spigot.  Finally, I like being able to buy through Amazon's subscribe and save program, which makes this oil a bit more economical to use.

review/summary: Pretty good, light OO
review/text: This was a pretty good olive oil.  I tried just dipping my bread in it to see the full flavor and this is my conclusion, even thought I freely admit I am no expert or anything.  First thing I noticed was the viscosity of it, pretty thin.  I don't know if that is good or bad, just an observation.  I figure this is good for salads, and didn't have too much effect on me dipping bread, but would rather have it a bit thick.  The flavor was good, not great.  It didn't have the rich fruity, nutty flavor I was hoping for, but was OK.  I had been using Pompeian and think I prefer its flavor better, at least in dipping.  After I use this up I will go back to Pompeian, its cheap at wmart and to me has the best flavor of any I have tried.  Conclusion is if you want a thin, light oil then this is a good choice, for a more robust flavor, there are better options.

review/text: I am getting this regularly via subscribe and save option and I must say this is a pretty good deal given the quality of the product. Although the taste difference in organic vs regular Zoe oils is subtle, I like to believe going organic is good for me. If you know much about or have used olive oils regularly, you'd love the taste of this particular extra virgin olive oil. Apart from being healthy this is full flavored - real extra virgin and not diluted like many store brands- and comes in a can to protect the oil from exposure to direct sun light. Go for it, with free shipping, you can't go wrong.

I depended on my regular shipments for my cooking needs and now I need to look for another affordable replacement until Amazon puts the price back down in the normal range (if they do).

review/summary: DO NOT BUY!
review/text: I am pretty upset about the recent pricing change on this product. I have been buying this for years and have had this on S&S for sometime.  My S&S was recently cancelled by Amazon at the same time it was suppose to ship (hence i ran out of Olive Oil).  I went on to re-order the product and thought at the time it was cancelled due to Amazon Frustration Free Packaging (yes I should have paid closer attention to the ounces when re-bought)however to my dismay when opening the package today the tins were HALF the size than the old ones.  So basically I am thinking ok - I wont be buying this brand again, I'll have to find a new one. Now I am even more upset as I just came on here to write a review and when I search Zoe Olive Oil - the 1 Liter tins came up - but are no longer on S&S <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0060JNAE8">Zoe Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 1 Liter Tins (Pack of 2)</a> and they are 50 cents more than the 25.5 ounce 2 Pack on S&S.  These are basically a rip off now.  I hate to leave a negative product review about something that I like, but this one bothered me so much I felt completed to inform other consumers about the recent changes.

I don't use butter or other oils anymore.<br /><br />Great product, well packaged for shipping, since Amazon likes to just toss things in a box without protecting anything.  This company thinks ahead, and the cans are very well protected for shipping.<br /><br />They are much smaller than they seem on the computer,  because of the shape, I guess.  Still a great value, even though they raise the price every order by about $2.00, so I probably will be shopping for another brand by next order..

review/summary: A Lighter, Less Intense Extra Virgin Olive Oil...
review/text: Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is a lighter, less intense extra virgin olive oil - the fact that it is organic is an added plus.  This oil is perfect for multiple uses such as dipping, baking, and incorporating into dressings and sauces which require oil.  It is also the perfect introduction for those individuals who are new to using olive oil since the olive (fruity) taste is less pronounced than it is in other EVOO's (Extra Virgin Olive Oils).  My spouse is one of those individuals who was encouraged by the cardiologist to switch to olive oil, but who did not like its taste.  That is until, after reading the reviews on Amazon, I purchased Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil.  It is the first in a long line of EVOO's that has met with his approval.<br /><br />Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is light and has a buttery taste.  One can add herbs to the oil for extra flavor; it does not overpower their taste.  Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent for adding to baked goods which call for oil.  Its mild flavor does not compete with the taste of other ingredients; there is no fruity aftertaste.  Personally, I did notice a peppery bite in my throat after using this oil as a dip, without the addition of either herbs or pepper.  The aftertaste was not particularly strong and was not evident when the oil was combined with balsamic vinegar or herbs.  Amazon's price for Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is excellent; it is far better than the cost of better EVOO's at the warehouse stores.<br /><br />This is a five-star product packaged in a three-star container.  The spout is difficult to pull out completely; pouring the oil can be a challenge.  The spout on the first can I opened was defective and split at the base when it was pulled out.  I did not notice this until I began to pour the oil and ended up with a puddle on the countertop.  Amazon's customer service was excellent with respect to resolving that issue.  I do like the size of the can which is easy to handle.  Unlike other EVOO's, Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil does not specify in which region of its country of origin the olives are grown, nor does it specify the year of harvest.  Further, unless the date is coded, the can does not indicate a best-used-by date.<br /><br />Despite these minor issues, this is a fine EVOO and I recommend it to anyone looking for a lighter, less intensely flavored EVOO.  You can't go wrong purchasing Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Amazon.

review/summary: Fine Organic Oil
review/text: I'm sure I'll reorder this product.  I cook quite a bit with Olive Oil...everything from Veggies, to Pancakes, to Burgers, and Steaks.  For cooking, it's tasty without any suprises.  Raw out of the bottle it has a bit of taste/zing to the back of the throat... a bit of burn.  That is entirely natural, and due to a naturally occuring penolic chemical in Olive Oil called Oleocanthal.  If your olive oil doesn't zing or burn the back of your throat, then it probably is a washed out, watered down version of the real deal.  Zoe has done a superb job here with Organic Oil at reasonable price.  Choose Zoe Organic, and be happy.  I recently read an article about a vinyard in Italy that had some 500 Olive trees.  Due to weather conditions, roughly half produced annually.  Many of the trees were over 250 years old.  Olive trees live 500-900 years, and some in Syria are as old as 1,500 years.  Anyways, the point is this.  With a crop of 500 trees, rough weather can produce 300 liters of pure organic olive oil.  The average tree in normal conditions will produce about 4 lieters of oil.  The current price you see for something like this Zoe Organic product is a steal.

review/summary: Best Value (Price/Quality) Olive Oil
review/text: I grabbed this on a special because it was such a good price for a quality olive oil. When I first tasted it, I was somewhat disappointed, because it had a strong "green" flavor, like the olives hadn't fully ripened. I relegated it to cooking and foods that it would be mixed in with, like hummus. Over time, I have grown to like it more, and now occasionally even use it for drizzling on salads and other foods where the olive oil's flavor is a stand-out part of the dish.<br /><br />I usually drizzle a little EVOO on top of hummus when I serve it along with kalamata olives, feta cheese, tzatziki and tabbouleh. Mmm, one of my favorite meals! I use the Zoe when I make the hummus, then use my favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BFG56A">'Nunez del Prado' Flor de Aceite Olive Oil Glass by La Tienda</a>, for the drizzle. I have bought it in a 1 Liter tin at my local upscale grocery store, but it is more expensive than the Zoe. I discovered Nunez de Prado when I asked them to let me have an olive oil tasting (like a wine tasting), and this one was by far my personal favorite.<br /><br />The special addition you get by drizzling the oil over many different foods really adds a lot of dimension and flavor, so you really want to get one that you love.<br /><br />The spout is messy no matter how I hold the can, so I decant it in into a glass bottle (store it in a dark cabinet).<br /><br />Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this oil for the price, it is very good quality, though it's not my favorite.

review/summary: Bad dispenser tin design, oil is fine
review/text: The olive oil is fine, but when you open the tin for the first time olive oil gets all over your fingers and runs down the sides of the tin. It's so full that squeezing the can a tiny bit sends up a fountain of olive oil. One must wipe the side of the tin clean after each use since oil invariably drips down the side. So good oil, bad tin design.

It is very floral/fruity with a hint of rich spicy herbs, and a bit of a bite on the finish - great stuff!<br /><br />Provecho.

review/summary: Quantity not worth the money
review/text: I could not belive the size of these tins for the price, so I ventured to measure the quantity since it didn't seem possible that the tins could possible hold 25.5 ounces in oil. Surely, the weight includes the weight of the tins which feels heavy enough to raise suspisions The quality was average and thus overpriced. Perhaps the fact that the oil is organic may due some justice. I will continue to do what I have been doing in the past and shop around.<br /><br />Update<br /><br />This oil is dangerous for frying in a pan, it splashes as if water was added to make this oil which would explain the lightness in texture. Disapointed that the container does not disclose that this is not pure oil and that water is being added.

review/text: Zoe Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil brings out the best in food, whether you cook with it or use it in salads. When I first bought it, my wife complained that it was too expensive. But after a while she said that it was better tasting than any oil she had ever used and insisted that we reorder it.<br /><br />We use olive oil because we are concerned about our cholesterol. Just a little bit of Zoe is all that is needed to cook foods in an Orka steamer for delicious and healthy meals, microwaved in just minutes. We use it almost daily to make wonderful tasting, fish and vegetables that way. Chinese leftovers and rice tastes like it was freshly cooked when you reheat it this way with teaspoon of this oil.<br /><br />We recommend it highly!

review/summary: Great All-Purpose Oil
review/text: This is a great olive oil.  It is really low in price for its organic certification and the fact that it is first cold-pressed (first cold pressing yields a much more nutritious, flavorful oil).  Other olive oils that can make those claims often cost twice what Zoe does, or more.  As to flavor, it is soft, buttery, and a little bit sweet; it tastes like olive oil (sounds dumb, but many olive oils sacrifice their fundamental "olive-ness" to achieve a wider appeal).  On the other hand, it is not so strong as to overpower other flavors when you cook with it.  Great for roasting garlic, as a base for sauces, and for sauteeing vegetables.  The two small tins are a nice touch, too, as you get a decent amount of oil, but can keep it half of it sealed up for freshness.

review/text: This olive oil so far is great. I love that it is in a tin so that I can leave it on the counter rather than having to place it in the cabinet.<br />However, it is best to put it into a carafe or olive oil dispenser because it can be quite difficult to pour and not spill.<br />As for the taste, it is very light and a bit nutty. Levels above many of the other oils at the same price level.<br />For the price, one should certainly try it out.

review/summary: a great evoo in general, cap is a bit messy
review/text: the quality of oil is great. I give it four stars because of the tin design. It is difficult to pour out the oil without it dripping leftovers on top.<br /><br />For those who haven't had real evoo, it might taste bitter at first- as a fresh oil will. I was initially surprised by the bitterness, but over time have appreciated it because it cuts down on the unctousness; works great with the acidity in vinegars for dressings or dipping bread. EVOO is very healthy and should be used raw if possible, only apply light heat to it. this isn't an oil for frying.

review/summary: Great oil -- from someone who never had good olive oil before.
review/text: I was that guy who always just bought a massive jug of extra virgin olive oil at whatever price I thought was decent. I had been getting the massive Bertolli jug at Sam's and thought that was pretty much the be all end all of olive oil. Man, I was wrong. I just accepted the fact that olive oil had a funky and unpleasant after taste.<br /><br />On a lark, I picked a few tins of the Zoe Organic when it was selling for $13.65 per two. This stuff is awesome. Great soft, mild taste that doesn't have the slimey and chemical flavor that most other olive oils have tried. I'm not an exceptional taster by any means, so I can't say it tasted like roses, or buttermilk or pepper or anything else. It's just good.<br /><br />I was a bit surprised at the small size of the tins. It isn't as big or as much oil as I pictured, but the sealed and dark tins should help it keep fresh for much longer. I don't think the price or quality can be beat.

review/summary: Never Thought I'd LIke Something Other than Quacker
review/text: My wife and I picked up some packages of these of the dollar store and weren't sure if they'd be a good deal or not. Were very pleasantly surprised. I almost exclusively eat Quaker apple cinnamon oatmeal, but I really liked this.<br /><br />I have to comment on the great packaging idea of this product comes in. First, if you care it's post have lower amount of packaging than comparable products and be better for the environment. Anyway, the thing I really do like about this is the pouches are also the measuring cup. You take a bowl, tear the pouch open, dump out the contents, then you fill be empty pouch with water up to a line on the pouch, dump it in the bowl, stir and then nuke it for 90 seconds. I don't know why nobody is ever thought of this before in any of the packaging I've seen, but it saves the guessing at how much water to put in or caring stupid measuring cup around with you if you're eating it work like I do. My only minor gripe is the line it asks you to tear at isn't the area that had the tear point so I mistook the tear line for the fill line and put in too much water the first four or five times I used it.<br /><br />When we went back to the store we picked up another three boxes pulled me out for the next few weeks. Give the stuff a try. You won't regret it!

review/summary: Great stuff, terrible price
review/text: I love this oatmeal, like the others I thought that at the price it would be not so good, but it is the best oatmeal I have ever had. I get it for $1 a box at Acme, but go through it so quickly I thought I would buy it in bulk. I am sorry to see that a three pack that I would pay 3 dollars for is so high. Guess I'll keep making trips to Acme for now, but let me know if the price comes down!

review/summary: Great  for the Price--Much Better Than the More Well Known Brand
review/text: I first saw this brand of oatmeal in the store and figured it couldn't possibly taste better than the more well-known brand, which wasn't all that great to begin with.  I picked some up and very pleasantly surprised.  It's less expensive and much better nutritionally.  It also uses less packaging, if you are concerned environmentally.  My only gripe is that the stores don't carry the strawberries & cream flavor--hooray for Amazon (yet again)!

review/text: I bought this because it was on sale and wasn't expecting it to be very good - instant oatmeal usually isn't. But, it was delicious.<br /><br />The pouch makes it easy to make (though I wonder if you can use this trick with any instant oatmeal).

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I prefer using dried beans as opposed to canned for various reasons. These chickpeas are an excellent product; I would definitely recommend them. Remember that the chickpeas will double in size after soaking, so, although six one-pound bags may not look like much, you will end up with plenty once they have finished soaking. I have used these to make falafel and sundried tomato hummus, and they worked beautifully.

review/summary: Excellent quality at a reasonable price
review/text: Chickpea bean is an excellent source for many minerals and proteins. I purchased two packs of them in order to get free shipping. The beans are carefully selected with fresh smell. I use them mostly for making the soup by the automatic soymilk maker. You will get smoother soup if the beans are presoaked in water for 8 to 10 hours just as you would do with the soybeans. I would recommend this product for everyone that wants to try the dairy replacement for proteins and calcium needs.

review/summary: My favorite chickpeas
review/text: I did not think there was such thing as "good chickpeas" until I bought these. They are fresh (and almost start sprouting after being soaked overnight!) and very flavorful. My husband started eating chickpeas after I got those. Will certainly buy again, especially at the great price that Amazon offers.
