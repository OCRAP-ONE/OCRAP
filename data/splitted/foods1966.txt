review/summary: Easy way to add flavor to many things
review/text: I love this onion mix and am so glad to be able to buy it with Subscribe & Save. This has become a staple in our house and has more uses than you can shake a wooden spoon at: mashed potatoes, soups, scrambled eggs & omelets, salad dressings, dips, marinated mushrooms, sauteed anything...<br /><br />Also, if you are a fan of a certain famous cream cheese in the Chive and Onion flavor... this spice mix is your ticket to making your own version at home...for much less money. I've even made it with yogurt cheese, which is a bit healthier and also yummy.<br /><br />The flavor is surprising for a freeze dried spice and ridiculously versatile. LOVE!

review/text: Krusteaz Oat Bran muffin mix is the best ever.  Nothing I would pick off the shelf, seeing just the name.  I'm not a health nut.  But I love Krusteaz Oat Bran muffins.  I was practically raised on them.  They're really easy to make (just add water, stir, put into muffin tin, and bake).  I can't buy them in town, so I was delighted to find them here.  Seriously, give them a try.  You won't regret it!

review/summary: NOT RAW ALMONDS!  See below
review/text: The FDA made it illegal to sell RAW Almonds in the Fall of 2007.  There are people who believe that the cure for cancer lies in the raw almond, and when the FDA got wind of it, they took them off of the market for 2 cases of food poisoning.  I don't see cantaloupe being outlawed and we had how many deaths recently from food poisoning?)<br />You can google the ruling and the outcome(s).<br />[...]<br /><br />The fact that this company advertises these as "RAW" almonds makes me angry.  This is false advertising.  They are steam pasteurized.  See the email below from the company to me, after I emailed them asking if these were truly "raw" almonds:<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />customerservice@berginfruitandnut.com<br />Customer Service to me<br />show details 10/20/2011 12:09 PM<br />Kristin,<br /><br />All our raw almonds are steam pasteurized.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />So, if you're looking for truly "raw" almonds, you must look at your local Farmers' Markets, or grow your own.

review/text: As a few other people have stated, the majority of the poor reviews for this item are the result of incorrect expectations. Raw almonds are a completely different nut from what many people expect when they think "almonds". I prefer them because they are softer, chewier, sweeter, richer, milder, etc. than the roasted almonds most folks are used to. These are fantastic. If you know what to expect from RAW almonds and that's what you're looking for, these definitely fit the bill!

review/summary: Very tasty nuts, but packaging could be better.
review/text: I like the taste of these almonds.  At first I was surprised by the small size of the package; I assumed that a pound of almonds would be a big bag, but not so.  Size notwithstanding, the packaging claims to be resealable.  However, the adhesive label fails to close the bag properly.  So, if you are adamant about freshness you may want to pour the almonds in another type of container.  The price seems to be a bit higher than normal for this quantity, but most likely can be attributed to the cost of shipping built-in.

review/summary: Now THIS is jerky chew!
review/text: I recently received a roll of this jerky chew, and will say that THIS is what jerky chew should be like! I have previously tried and reviewed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZI0RG">Jack Links Chew, Original Flavor, 0.32-Ounce Units (Pack of 24)</a>. That stuff tasted like ground up cardboard and pepper that blows away when you open the can. Buffalo Bill's chew is has plenty of flavor, but also is actual shredded (not ground) jerky. The only fault is that occasionally you might get a little chunk that's too big for your lip, which makes it kind of painful. But I usually just chew those right up anyhow. This chew is neither too dry nor too moist.<br /><br />I like to use jerky chew when riding horses or working in dusty conditions, as it helps keep my mouth moist. And though it's not laced with caffine or nicotine, it does help keep you awake because it keeps your mouth and mind busy.<br /><br />I will say without a doubt that this is the best jerky chew I've tried thus far. Even my kids like it!

review/summary: Buffalo Bill pulled a fast one on me
review/text: I ate shredded beef jerky chew years ago when a friend gave me a can. I liked it and it was pretty good so I thought I'd buy some. Despite the positive reviews I got a mixed bag. It turned out 42% (or 5 out of 12 cans) of the Teriyaki beef chew was bad, I don't know if they tried to slip in some old expired jerky to pull a fast one to cut losses or a bad batch was mixed in. By bad I mean it tasted like saw dust in your mouth and wood chips, when jerky chew tastes like saw dust with bits of wood chips it isn't jerky anymore. Eating the bad jerky is like putting sand in your mouth or better yet ashes or even sand paper. I did however buy a roll of the Hickory (black cans) and a roll of Spicy (red cans) and those were better in my experience. To know if you have a bad can shake the can and if it sounds like a lot of pebbles are rolling around in the can then you got a bad can that will taste like saw dust. If I wanted sand in my mouth I would've went to the beach.<br /><br />-Pros-<br />I only got 7 good cans<br />The good cans tasted like I expected it to taste<br /><br />-Cons-<br />Got 5 bad cans<br />The bad cans taste like saw dust & wood chips<br />I had to feed the bad cans to the dog<br /><br />Looks like Buffalo Bill was able to give me the slip on the Wild West Trail and swapped the good jerky I was suppose to get with saw dust. My recommendation, avoid the Teriyaki unless you want saw dust in your mouth and pick up the Spicy and Hickory flavors instead. I have a hunch that no one buys the Teriyaki flavors, that would explain why almost half of the ones I bought were bad. Would I buy this again in the future? Probably not.

review/summary: Tasty but disappointing at the same time...
review/text: As I write my first review on Amazon, I enjoy sucking on the flavor of my 6th of 12 cans... each having nearly the same flavor yet severely lacking consistency in the portion (1/3 of a the can is "full" when opened in my current can versus 1/4 of the can in some instances and always below 1/2 in others). Moisture content is consistent but poor... most cans are as dry as Vegas in August and only one had a hint of moisture (maybe Colorado in summer?). The flavor is fairly consistent but to be a "chew", the cut is decent size overall but far from perfect. I'll finish these cans for the flavor and forget the variables and likely keep the cans to shred some of their Teriyaki flavored jerky in the food processor that they sent as a sample to place in the cans. That was tasty in "stick" form and the way jerky should be served! Overall, not very happy so would have to give it the thumbs down... Sorry Bill.

review/text: I like the taste of this jerky, but they could easily fit 5 times the amount in each container and if your not incredibly careful opening each one you will find the tiny amount you got is now all over the carpet. I've purchased single unites at the store and it seemed much more tightly packed..this feels like a waste of plastic..they could sell one to every 5 to 7 units by just filling one up...not impressed at all. Poor environmental practice not to mention a bit deceitful.

review/text: I'm on my second order and I can't say much other than i love this stuff. It tastes just like their beef jerky, which comes free with an order of their chew, and it keeps my munchies at bay. I'm on my third can however and I got a surprise when their Hickory jerky began to taste spicy. I have yet to try the other cans but one of them is definitely spice chew and not hickory like i ordered. It still tasted awesome, and considering I needed to wake up and write a paper it came at a perfect time but it still wasn't what I had paid for. Awesome stuff just not always canned to perfection.

review/text: Overall, this has very good flavor.  And the packaging is very convenient.  My only complaint is a small gripe - some of the chunks in the "tins" are too large to truly be considered "chew" to be placed between the cheek and gum.  Given how much shredding is done to make the product, I would expect it all to be of similar consistency.  It's a small complaint though.  Overall a very good product with good taste and freshness.

review/summary: Very disappointing
review/text: I decided to try this "shredded jerky" because Buffalo Bills country cut jerky is really great and I kinda wanted the cans to put some of my country cut jerky into.  Well the cans are rather tiny and the jerky inside is very very salty.  It's not really shredded, it's more like dust.  Once you start chewing it - after getting over the saltiness, most of it turns into a wad of unchewable fat.<br /><br />Each little can will give you about  5 or 6 pinches of jerky dust, and you will spit out about 65% of that.  I will not buy this product again.  I will stick to their country cut mild, spicy, or chipotle habanero flavors.

review/summary: A Great Starter Jerky for Vegans
review/text: BB's shredded jerky is a great way to introduce vegans to the joys of dried beef.  "But wait!" You say. "I'm a vegan and I don't eat meat."  That's okay, because this is high quality beef.  The Ulinov household keeps a strict vegan diet while working in beef, chicken or pork (sometimes fish) in order to have a well-rounded, diverse diet.<br /><br />Consuming organic beef jerky is just like keeping vegan since it is organic.  While BB's is not organic, it is a good starting place since you don't want to jump into organic beef right away -- work slowly into it.  Invite your favorite vegetarian neighor over, put this in a casserole and tell them that it is seaweed.  Then later on inform them that they ate a cute little cow and watch their reaction.  They will be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: My Cat Went BERSERK When I Opened These
review/text: Our cat is pretty picky.  He eats a raw handmade dinner at night and a high quality dry food with water in the morning.  He is an outdoor cat.  When I get something new to give him, he often will look at me partially interested and then take a sniff or a lick and want to go outside.<br /><br />When our cat is hot, he often is not very interested in food.  He flops down and complains all day when it is hot, but does not like much of anything- food included.  The day I got my package of these treats in the mail, our cat was flopping underneath some planters on the porch.  He was not overly interested in me when I came out the door, other than to give me a tiny "Mew" to let me know he was there.<br /><br />I walked over to him with the box of sealed treats and told him I had a treat for him.  He began to sniff the air.  He almost never does that- especially with a sealed bag in a box!  I opened the box and then struggled with the bag as the peel off top which leads to a zip lock back inside did not come complete off.  The cat jumped on my leg and began to help me open the bag.  Clearly he was interested.<br /><br />Then I finally managed to get the bag open, and I broke one of the thick cakes of treat in half and held it up to him.  He leaped in the air and grabbed it with his paws like hands, and forced it on the ground where he held it in place with both hands and claws.  He held it and chewed on it with passion until it was all gone.  He even licked little crumbs up off the floor, something he almost never does.<br /><br />I decided to give him the other half and told him that it was all he would get.  He jumped in the air and begged until he got the cake from me.  He did things he rarely does when I offer him anything to eat.  Then he polished off that too.  When he was done, he went back to being the ultimate cool cat and adopting his sense of boredom at my existence he went back to flopping under the planter.<br /><br />These treats smell delicious, stay fresh in the bag, and I have to say that these treats bring about such a passion and excitement in our cat that he gets all happy and really into the process of eating a treat, licking it all up until it is gone.  I rarely see him get this excited over any food item except his homemade dinner at night.  I can not recommend these highly enough.  I am thinking these will be a regular feature at our house from this point on!

review/summary: Anyone remember dissecting owl pellets in grade-school?
review/text: That was my first impression of these treats out of the bag...  dried up owl pellets (yick).  Not that appearances matter all that much if your pet loves the taste but these are big treats and for my small sized dog, that meant I had to break it apart with my hands which was a touch bit unpleasant for moi.<br /><br />As for my dog, he simply didn't care for these at all.  I really wanted him to like them since he turns his nose up to nearly every treat imaginable (including bits of people food, which I don't consider a bad thing) and I'm always looking for ways to create a little variety for him.  Aside from his dog food, the only treats I've found he likes are the soft/chewy Buddy Treats in chicken flavor and dried chicken cutlets (kind of like chicken jerky) which I stopped giving him after an incident last year where he nearly choked on one.<br /><br />I thought these might have been a good replacement for the dried chicken cutlets that he liked so much because I assumed that these would primarily contain one ingredient (chicken) that had been formed into easier to chew treats.  Of course, this is in part my fault for making such an assumption but I'd like to point out there wasn't and currently isn't an ingredient listing available on this product.  The closest reference to what these treats contain are in the following descriptions "Your dog's instinctive nature is to eat more meat, poultry, or fish protein and less grain... Instinct Raw Boost Bites are grain-free and gluten-free - perfect for satisfying your dog's carnivorous cravings and nutritional needs...  Raw Boost Bites are a pure and healthy treat made from minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients..."  For those of you who may be interested, here is the actual ingredient listing in order as they appear:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS<br />Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots, Ground Chicken Bone, Butternut Squash, Ground Flaxseeds, Montmorillonite Clay, Broccoli, Lettuce, Spinach, Dried Kelp, Apple Cider Vinegar, Parsley, Honey, Salmon Oil, Olive Oil, Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural preservative), Rosemary, Blueberries, Alfalfa Sprouts, Persimmons, Inulin, Sage, Clove.<br /><br />Looks like they're really trying to appeal to a 'natural/holistic' audience and I for one am okay with that - in fact, I try and avoid treats for my dog (and myself!) that contain ingredients I don't know to be 'real' however... had I known these to be the ingredients up front, I'd probably have passed knowing that my dog already turns his nose up to the following food items (turkey, apples, carrots, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, blueberries or persimmons).  There are also quite a few ingredients that I never thought about seeing if my dog would enjoy as well as a few 'questionable to me' ingredients (cloves??)<br /><br />I gave this at least three stars because the ingredient list isn't bad per se, but they should update their product description to include this information and although my dog didn't care for them and I couldn't coax him into a second bite - he did manage to eat a first bite after lots of encouragement.  That's a pretty big deal coming from a dog with as fickle a palate as his.

review/summary: 4 Out of 4 Dogs Enthusiastically Approve
review/text: OK, I have to say this is an expensive doggie treat, but my dogs practically steamroll one another to get to the treats. The circular disks of freeze dried chicken are rather big- bigger than a silver dollar and more than a half inch thick. They are very light because of the nature of the treat, and the dogs practically inhale them despite their size. I have 4 dogs and one is somewhat picky, but they all love these treats.<br /><br />There are under 20 treats in the package, so for $10-13 per package and with 4 dogs, they get about 4 treats a piece per package. And since these are treats, not bones, they don't last very long. I think these might be the "Doggie Christmas Stocking" type treat for special occasions, not an everyday treat due to the expense. But nonetheless, the dogs LOVE them!<br /><br />**4 stars due to price, but product gets 5 stars!

review/summary: Great ingredients, dog can't resist!
review/text: My dog is getting a little picky in her "old age" and doesn't usually like treats anymore.  The Natures Variety Raw Boost Bites though, she couldn't resist.  I actually caught her trying to get the bag open after it was left on the ground by the kids!  I love that you can actually read the ingredient list.  First several ingredients include Chicken, Turkey, Turkey Liver, Turkey Heart, Pumpkinseeds, Apples, Carrots... the rest of the list is just as great.  Only ingredients that aren't "real food" are Montmorillonite Clay and Mixed Tocopherols with Citric Acid (a natural perservative)<br /><br />Great for pets with allergy problems!

review/summary: Strange stuff, but the finicky cat likes it.
review/text: I don't know what I was expecting with these, but I guess I was thinking the "bites" would be cat-sized, not Great Dane-sized. The "bites" are about 1.75" in diameter and look like miniature hamburger patties. They are very light weight and are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />We've got two cats, the finicky one, and the one who will eat anything.<br /><br />After breaking one piece into about 5 smaller chunks, I gave a chunk to each cat and was pleasantly surprised to see them both eating them, and actually chewing - they usually inhale smaller treats, so it's nice to see them actually put their teeth to use!<br /><br />I'll definitely continue to purchase these, as it's tough for me to find anything the finicky cat will eat, I just wish they came in a smaller size.<br /><br />I've added some images of the product so you can actually see what you are getting. This 4-ounce package contained about 18 pieces.

review/summary: Large and awkward size for cats, might be better for dogs
review/text: Another reviewer said these looked like "hairballs that have been compressed into cookie shapes", and aside from the color, I'd have to agree.  Each bite is far too large for an ordinary house cat, and the directions say "Treat your pet with 1 to 2 Boost Bites per day per 20 lb of body weight."  My cat weighs much less than 20 pounds, so I cut one of these up into quarters.<br /><br />Well, I tried, anyway.  They don't cut, they crumble.  They seem to have a texture like a fibrous insulation I'd used for soundproofing.  I picked a piece out of the crumbs and dust and fed it to my cat.  He swatted at it a few times then swallowed it whole, even though it was twice as large as his usual treats, which he normally chews.  He wasn't interested in more.  I scooped together a pile of crumbs, added a couple of drops of water, and molded them into a lump.  Wet, he loved it, first chewing up the lump then snuffling up the escaped crumbs.  Right now he's trying to convince me that more testing is needed.<br /><br />The packaging hints at mysterious and wonderful benefits, but I'm a bit doubtful.  It suggests:<br /><br />"Instinct Raw Boost Bites may help promote:<br />*Vitality & energy<br />*Digestive health<br />*Lean muscles<br />Give your pets Instinct Raw Boost Bites and boost their health with the purity of raw food."<br /><br />The raw ingredients, after chicken and turkey parts, include fruits, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, montmorillonite clay, lettuce and spinach, and dried kelp and sprouts, among other things.  The package goes on to claim:<br /><br />"Our purpose is to empower people to transform the lives of pets.  Freedom from allergies, improved skin & coat, weight loss, reduced incidence of ear infections, and healthier teeth and gums are just a handful of the amazing pet transformations that Nature's Variety customers experience."<br /><br />If there's an amazing pet transformation I'll update my review.  Personally, I'm hoping for an amphibious vehicle, but I'll settle for a dog.<br /><br />These are too large and messy, they require added water to really get the cat interested, and this is a pretty hefty price tag for high maintenance treats, but he does seem to like them once they're wet.

review/summary: My Cats Love These
review/text: We have 3 cats and 2 will eat almost any treat, but one is very picky. It was around noon, so my one cat was  in the kitchen, looking for "lunch". I had just fed them an hour earlier, so there was no way I was opening another can of food.  I thought this would be a good time to try out the New Raw Boost Bites.<br />I took one of the pieces (they are quite big and look like a bite-size cookie) and broke it into smaller sizes. For dogs, I imagine you would not have to do this.<br />Well, they gobbled it right up! I had to break apart another for them right away. Then satisfied, they forget all about lunch and went to go relax. I guess these are a satisfying enough treat to tide them over until dinner.<br />Knowing these are not only tasty (at least from watching them eat them) but also good for them makes me feel good about feeding them to my cats.  You get about 18 in a pack, so I will be saving them for rewards or special treats.

review/text: This was listed as a cat treat. On the package it is stated to be for cats and dogs. I got them for my cats and thought it strange that the treat itself was the size of an oreo cookie. It is kind of crumbly like a stale cookie, but filled with real ingrediants like chicken and turkey. I had to crumble it into bite size pieces for my cats. They did eat it, but were less than enthusiastic. They prefer Temptations treats apparently. This would probably work better as a treat for dogs.

I got them these treats and they both liked them. The treats are about the size of a chicken nugget but they are very light and almost crumbly. They smell fishy to me but they are chicken. The directions say they are treats for dogs and cats and to give 1-2 for each 20 pounds. Since my cats are about 10lbs each I decided to split 1 between the two.<br />I have had a good experience with this brand and I recommend it.

review/text: We have two dogs, a chihuahua and a beagle.  Both of them love the Boost Bites Treats.  As soon as they see the bag, they come running for their "cookie".  The treats are shaped like little cookies and are light brown in color so they actually look like gingersnaps.<br />The nutrition data and info on the label is impressive regarding how these treats can help your dog's digestion and provide other health benefits.  That's always nice to know - that you're giving your furry babies something that they love and it's good for them as well.  The treats are pretty soft so easy to chew for both dogs although I have to break up the one that the chihuahua gets - the cookie is a bit too big for her mouth.  Overall, I think this is a wonderful product to pamper a beloved pet.

review/text: For those who like are feeding their dogs the raw food diet, these bites may something you could use for treats.<br /><br />There's nothing artificial in the ingredients. As listed on the box: chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkinseeds, apples, carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseeds, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, apple cider, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, mixed tocopherols with citric acid, rosemary, blueberries, alfalfa sprouts, persimmons, inulin, sage, and clove.<br /><br />This treat is labeled for dogs and cats but I have large dogs (80+ pound Labs) and these treats were finished in less than 5 seconds. For large dogs, I think this may work out better as a training treat - they are easy to break into pieces.<br /><br />There are 18 in a package, about the size of a silver dollar, and about 1/2 inch thick. They have the  consistency of freeze dried food and were very quickly eaten by my Labs.  All loved it but for the size of my dogs, it's an expensive treat.

review/text: I have a box of Milk Bone flavor snacks, a box of Beneful Baked Delights and one of Raw Boost Bites, lets see how they stack up with the first few ingredients.<br /><br />Milk Bone: Wheat flour, wheat bran, wheat and bone meal, poultry by-products, beef fat, wheat germ, salt---and then a list of ingredients that no one can pronounce.<br /><br />Beneful: Wheat flour, ground corn, glycerin, sugar, corn gluten, water, chicken by-product, preserved animal fat----and then to the food color dye etc...<br /><br />Raw Boost:  Chicken, turkey, turkey liver, turkey heart, pumpkin seed, apples, carrots, butternut squash, flax-seed, montmorillonite clay, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, dried kelp, vinegar, parsley, salmon oil, citric acid, rosemary, blueberries etc.  No food color, preservatives that are difficult to pronounce.  They are made by a small company in NE that obviously care about the health of our pets.<br /><br />Another interesting comparison is the amount moisture and protein.  Milk Bone: 12% moisture, 15% protein.<br />  Beneful: 20% moisture, 14% protein.<br />  Raw Boost:  4% moisture 40% protein.<br /><br />Rather interesting I thought, we usually don't have time to check out what's in our pets food at the store, always in a hurry.  I just thought you might like look at this too.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the treats!  We have two min. schnauzers who always love their "goodies"----and they are rather picky about their food.  The Raw Boost Bites passed with flying colors, so I (with tongue in cheek) think these are the ones that picky pets would choose.<br /><br />Would recommend this product to any pet lover.

review/summary: Tasty but expensive freeze dried pet treats
review/text: My dog is a 62lb English Bulldog/German Shepherd mix that repeatedly suffers from allergies, especially food allergies. He can also be a bit of a picky eater when it comes to his treats so finding the right mix can often be difficult. I always have reservations about trying new treats as a large majority of popular dog treats today are filled with terrible ingredients not to mention carrying a high price tag. I'm always willing to try a new treats so here are my thoughts on Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats;<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />+ High in protein, 40%.<br /><br />+ Minimally processed and freeze dried raw ingredients.<br /><br />+ Dog loved them.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />- Expensive.  $10 for four ounces is a lot.<br /><br />- High in fat, 34%.<br /><br />- Messy and crumbly texture.<br /><br />My dog really enjoyed Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Chicken Treats.  Despite being extremely high in fat content the freeze dried raw ingredients are quite healthy compared to many of treats on the market.  Unfortunately, the high price tag on these treats would make me hesitant about purchasing them on a regular basis.

review/summary: My Cat and I Share a RAW FOOD Diet
review/text: NATURE'S VARIETY INSTINCT RAW BOOST BITES FREEZE-DRIED TREATS (aka "Boost Bites") provides a little treat for my cat, that isnt the JUNK FOOD normally found in name brand cat treats. The Friskies cat treats contain Brewers Rice, chicken meal, corn meal, animal fat, animal liver, malt, artificial flavors, brewers yeast, and a chemistry lab of various preservatives, and artificial colors.<br /><br /> Compare that to the RAW ingrediants of BOOST BITES: Chicken, Turkey, Turkey liver and heart, Pumpkin Seeds, Apples, Carrots, ground chicken bone, butternut squash, ground flaxseed, clay (for natural vitamins), broccoli, lettuce, spinach, kelp, vinegar, parsley, honey, salmon oil, olive oil, Vitamin E, Rosemary, blueberries, Alfalfa sprouts, permissons, sage, and clove.<br /><br />The BOOST BITES are a RAW FOOD. For years I've been eating a raw food diet for dinner, consisting of MUESLI. Muesli was invented by a Swiss doctor, consisting of various raw grains, dried fruit, and unbaked seeds and nuts, soaked in soy milk. The concept behind raw foods, is that cooking destroys the enzymes in food, as well as many vitamins, which our body requires. If I'm going to eat a raw diet for my health, I might as well share that benefit with my cat. Our pets arent that different than us, and i'm NOT anthopomorphizing. They require these raw enzymes just like we do, and our pets are healthier with them. If I didnt believe in the health benefits of raw food, I wouldnt spend the extra money for Muesli.<br /><br />Needless to say, a raw food diet means nothing to my cat. He eats Boost Bites cos he thinks they taste great. In fact, I gave him a taste test, placing a bit of BOOST BITES, next to his Friskies treats. He goobled down the Boost Bites, and left the Friskies Treats lay there untouched. (Tho he ate those too, when he figured out he wasnt getting more Boost Bites.)These cost a bit more than the treats from the grocery store, but they are his vitamin suppliment. Along with the EFA fish oil capsels I squeeze on his food, my cat's recieving an excellent diet. His digestion is good, and his coat doesnt flake off all this excessive dander, that used to cause him to scratch himself raw. A healthy cat is a happy cat. And a happy cat, is a happy cat owner.

Of course, I broke the treats up into manageable sizes for cats, still no luck. Well, cats are known to be finicky and mine are no exception. One day they love something and the next day they could not care less.

review/summary: A big hit with my two 3-year old felines. And a Google check okays its fat content
review/text: Being totally clueless about minimum recommended content of protein, fat and fiber in feline diets, and considerably worried about the healthfulness of this product after reading another Amazon reviewer's warning of what he found to be the way-too-high fat content of these treats--the label says "crude fat (min.) 34.0%"--, I went online and found a link to a National Research Council site titled "Your Cat's Nutritional Needs: A Science Based Guide for Pet Owners"  which appears to be the work of a cadre of science professors from about a dozen universities.  They say:<br /><br /> "The maximum amount of fat in the cat's diet can be reasonably high without any<br />known adverse effects. In many cat foods, 50% or more of the energy comes from<br />fat. Studies indicate that cat foods containing even higher amounts of fat are safe.<br />At a minimum, cat foods should have a fat content of about 9% of dry matter."<br /><br />Which is a relief, considering how much my two three-year-old cats, Purrcilla and B.J. Honeycatt, seem to love this stuff.<br /><br /> I think this is the first pet treat I've ever seen that is labeled as being for both dogs and cats.  The size of these dry treats--there are about a dozen and a half of them in this 4 oz. bag-inside-a-box, each about the size of a half inch high stack of silver dollars--is  more dog friendly than cat friendly, but the discs break in two easily; Once a day I crumble and split half a disc between their two bowls as a topper for their wet food...or sometimes instead, use it as a bedtime treat. So for two cats I estimate getting about a month's worth out of this package.<br /><br />I've bookmarked the site mentioned above for future reference (too bad Amazon doesn't allow us to link to outside sites in our reviews).

review/text: What can I say?  The dog liked it - I certainly didn't taste it.  He didn't gobble it down at first since it was something new so let me describe it....<br /><br />I handed it to him and, after a few cautious and tentative sniffs he took it from my hand and took it over to his favorite spot.  He set it on the ground, licked it a few times to roll it over and sniff the other side - this went on a couple of times and humorous to watch.  From there, he was like a little kid and took a small sample bite to give it a try.  After a few tentative chews and a reluctant swallow, he looked up to see if it was ok to proceed.<br /><br />Proceed he did, as he crunched away at the remainder of the treat and, after a satisfactorily smack of the lips he ran over to beg for another (which he didn't get).  I do like the fact there is a lot of meat products vs. garbage in the Made in the USA treat!

review/summary: they don't last long....
review/text: Okay, I'm rating these based on my cats' reactions to these treats. While one is the exact opposite of a picky eater (ANYTHING that is remotely edible that hits the floor is fair game in her mind), the other is a lot more finicky when it comes to snacks.  Needless to say, the feline garbage can literally inhaled these treats and was looking for more.  Cat #2 took a little more time/investigation when it came to the treat (that or she just likes for the other cat to be tormented while being held back from snatching up the treat as she sniffs at it for a minute, something I really don't put past her), but once she tried it, she was much quicker eating the second bite.  Finding a treat that both cats enjoy and is made of seemingly healthy ingredients/less crappy filler is a great thing.<br /><br />That said, these things are NOT cheap.  You do not get a lot for your money, though at least if you're buying them for cats,  you can break up the round treats to share them among several cats or get a couple of feedings out of one piece. I can see these being more of a special occasion snack than an every day thing - at least while on the current budget.

One look at them from my all-too-human perspective and I had a whole new scale by which to determine how important my art as a reviewer really was to me.<br /><br />Be that as it may, I found the reactions of the three cats I gave these to a surprisingly mixed bag.<br /><br />One, the finnickiest eater that will do anything for a piece of Salisbury steak half the size of your pinky, ate one whole one (which I had to break into quarters) and lost interest halfway through the second one. The second one sniffed at a piece exactly once and walked away, while the skinny and freakish third one that never liked me (they're my roomate's cats, not mine) had a reaction that, translated into words, would have been this more or less:<br /><br />"Hmmm... I see you have that. What is that? interesting... aroma, yes, the word is aroma... intriguing... perhaps even enticing...<br /><br />Where did you get it? Give it to me. Give it to me now!<br /><br />Hmmm... Yeeeeees...<br /><br />You have more, don't you? Good. Give it to me! Give it to me now!<br /><br />[chewing] Yes. I'll submit to your petting me while I eat it (Stay away from the neck!) and maybe, I say *maybe* afterwards if you have a supply of these and can provide me with more of them.<br /><br />[more chewing} You know, I never liked you, not really, not before, but now I see you're really not so bad a fellow after all..."<br /><br />So there it is. A temporary hit. A great big hit and a definite miss on three housecats. They're somewhat expensive for pet-treats but, with the right cat, you could use them to try and teach the basics like, "come when I say your name" and "hiss at someone else."<br /><br />As far as dogs are concerned, this is going to have to wait until I can overcome the idea of how a stranger might react to my approaching him or her and saying, "Hey, you don't know me. I don't know you, but I still want to feed this to your dog."<br /><br />More about that after I get some time to screw up my courage.

review/summary: Some Do; Some Don't
review/text: I have about 20 cats so gave this product a true test. Results: some like it very much; some didn't...so it probably depends upon when you give your cats this product...<br /><br />Striper was my first taste tester...she went after it right away...but left it shortly thereafter...In fact, most of the cats and kittens did... it was too big for them! When I broke it down for Striper, she ate it all...so did the kittens who even fought over it. But, again, grown cats sniffed and left it alone...<br /><br />Now I feed my cats both dry and canned food and they might be spoiled but given the size and mess of breaking them down into pieces, I wouldn't buy them again...that's my opinion...<br /><br />The cats, like I said could take it or leave it... Probably depends upon their regular diets, but this wasn't a treat in my opinion...

review/summary: Mixed Reaction & WAY Too Much FAT!!!!!! Read That Label....
review/text: We have 2 old Indoor Tabby cats about 12 years old who will eat ANYTHING and are 20 & 22 pounds. These monsters are still a terror that is fitting for their names of Lucy & Ethel...But I have to crush these up into crumbly pieces small enough for them to sample. First time they both LOVED it. Then Lucy threw it up and she has only thrown up 1 or 2 times in 12 years. Ethel throws up a few times ever week but did fine. From that time on however, they BOTH simply refused ever trying this food treat. So off we go to the neighbors & friends at work. 2 other families had the problem that NONE of the 6 other cats we tried would even try a sample of this food. We tried baby talking, tried bribery, tried everything but force feeding, the brats wouldn't got NEAR this stuff!<br /><br />  Ok, now dogs. Well here is a completely different result. Every dog we tried simply DEVOURED the stuff. Now, when I walk out to get the mail I almost fear for my life with the way these dogs eyeball me:-) But has anyone ever read the label? The far content of 20% plus makes me a pet owner who would NEVER feed this to my pet. Not even as a treat. The manufacturer seems to almost (to me anyway) market this as a pet health food? Sorry, don't care what pet loves it or hates it, I would never give any to any pet since I love them way too much to feed them all that I see on that label. Every time I complain to out Veterinarian about how big our cats are he explains that they are perfect actually. That they are just very large and STRONG, that it is not fat and not to worry. Sure different that what MY doctor tells Me....<br /><br />  Again, I am no Vet, but read the label, look that best friend you call a pet in the eye and ask yourself if you feel right about stuffing it with fat?

review/summary: Very tasty
review/text: My name is Patrick, and I am an American shorthair of indeterminate age and semi-discriminating tastes.  My human asked me to write this review for the Instinct Raw Boost Bites: Chicken Formula she got through the Vine program because she is unable to sample them herself.<br /><br />I gobbled up the portion my human gave me right away.  As far as I'm concerned, these deserve two paws up.  My housemate Tiger, also enjoyed the Bites.  She has a more discriminating palate than me, but she liked these just fine.  We think they compare favorably to other feline brand  snacks, like Pounce and Temptations.  Each piece is larger than say, a Pounce pellet, which our human broke into smaller pieces, so one or two make a more than adequate snack.<br /><br />According to my human, the package says that the treats are grain-free and are made from "minimally processed, freeze dried raw ingredients."  Ingredients include chicken, turkey, vegetables like butternut squash and broccoli, ground flaxseed, salmon oil, and mixed tocopherols with citric acid (?).  I'm not entirely sure what all that stuff means, but I would recommend the Bites to other cats who enjoy chicken flavored snacks that are meant for cats.

review/summary: Finicky Cat Purrs While Eating
review/text: Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken compares favorable with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0052OUXHO">Stella & Chewy's Freeze-Dried Salmon & Chicken Dinner for Cats, 12oz</a> which my older cat really enjoys.<br /><br />As both foods are freeze-dried, they both need reconstitution--I heat some water, place some of the food in a shallow dish and pour the water over the food.  I wait a few minutes, allowing the food to get soft, drain the water and then place in the cat dish.  Its a great "hot" food alternative for the cat who is too finicky to eat other types of raw food.<br /><br />Nature's Variety is easier to portion.  Each chunk of food comes as a disk around the size of a fifty-cent piece with about half an inch of thickness.  Once softened, I have cut this a bit with a fork, but for the most part, my cat likes it so much she moves it off her plate to attack it whole.  The Stella and Chewy food comes in smaller tater tot shapes which unfortunately, depending upon the way they are packed to be shipped can arrive crushed.  For some reason, the crushed food does not appeal to my cat.  In addition, it is difficult to decide just how much food to give the cat--once reconstituted, the food will go to waste if the cat, like mine, decides not to eat it all.  Nature's Variety's size makes this easier to manage and will result in less waste.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Nature's Variety Instinct Raw Boost Bites Freeze-Dried Treats, Chicken, makes for a seemingly delicious entree item for my very picky cat who purrs while she eats it.  Easy to portion out and reconstitute, it makes for a raw treat to "serve" on top of kibble or just alone.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: I've tried several different kinds of freeze-dried chicken treats and, for the most part, they are all so dehydrated that they literally turn into dust in the bag.  You get a couple of solid pieces out of a bag, then the rest you have to sprinkle on top of dog food because it's just chicken powder.  These don't do that!  They have some additional ingredients in them besides chicken (veggies and fruit mostly) so they stay together very nicely.  They are definitely designed for larger dogs - each treat is about the size of a fifty-cent piece (when was the last time you saw one of those?) and about a quarter to a half an inch thick.  But they break easily into smaller pieces for little dogs.  I have teeny, tiny chihuahuas so I have to break these treats into M&M-sized pieces for them, but they can't get enough!  And the bag goes a long ways if you are breaking them down into smaller treats.  These are now permanently on my shopping list for my babies.

review/summary: A nice, bite sized snack
review/text: All three hounds ate these quite enthusiastically. They're made in the USA, and have a lengthy list of ingredients that all appear to be healthy, a good mix of protein fat and fiber. I lopped one star off my review, as ~$40 a pound is rather steep for a dog snack.

review/summary: Delicacy for my dogs
review/text: One of our dogs is extremely picky when it comes to food and treats. Sometimes he just sniffs and then turns away, obviously disgusted. Sometimes he'd take the treat in his mouth and then moves his head down so the treat just falls out of his open mouth on the floor. Then he walks away... He is an awesome dog but quite the character.<br />However, these treats are a big hit for both of our dogs..!! They aboslutely love this healthy delicacy. They are a bit on the pricey side but I will order them as a special treat for them once in a while. Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Treat For Dogs!  VERY EXPENSIVE!!
review/text: My dog loves these treats!  They are a good all natural product which I have no issues or concerns with giving it to my dog.  I feed my dog Wellness Core because he cannot eat grains due to skin allergies.  So to find a good quality grain free treat that my dog likes is great.  I break the treats into 4 pieces because of the cost.  Four ounces for almost 11 dollars is quite costly.  That means these treats are 44 dollars a pound!! I won't be buying much of these treat very often because of the cost.  Sorry Natural Instinct....you have a great product line but 44 dollars a pound is ridiculous!  This isn't filet mingnon people! Five stars for quality 1 star for price = 3 Stars overall.

review/summary: My dogs love it
review/text: I have two dogs at home, and my sister has another. One of my Pomeranians is extremely picky which makes it difficult to purchase treats or even foods that he isn't already familiar with, because it's more likely than not that he will reject whatever I get him. Imagine my surprise when my dog loved this treat! He always runs to the kitchen when he senses I'm getting a treat for him, and he actually jumps up and down when he sees that I have these.<br /><br />My other dog is sixteen and has no teeth, so unfortunately these are too hard for him, but I try to break of very small pieces for him so he's able to get a taste. My sister's dog will eat everything so no surprise that he likes these too.<br /><br />They're a little pricey but I think that given how much the dogs love these, and the fact that I have small dogs so these can last for a little while, makes them a worthwhile purchase when I'm out.

review/summary: A hung jury amongst the kitties results in a mistrial
review/text: We have four cats.  Two of them went crazy over these treats and fought with each other to claim every last bit of the treat.  A third one tried them once and never could be induced to try them again, and the fourth refused to have anything to do with them.  Every other cat treat we have brought into the house has always been greeted with unamimous enthusiasm, so I don't really know what to think of this.  Your mileage may vary; for my part, if I am going to pay this kind of money for a cat treat, I want something I know everyone is going to like.
