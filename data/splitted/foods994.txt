review/summary: Excellent Breadsticks
review/text: I highly recommend this product. They taste as close to ordinary breadsticks as you can get. We've been ordering them for years--and we've been waiting for months for Amazon to finally get them in. The comparable price is $6.69 per unit from glutenfree.com, so the price is right. The taste is right. What are you waiting for??

review/summary: Best Gluten Free Breadsticks EVER!
review/text: Schar has many products that my 91 year old Father enjoys since he began his gluten free diet.  The breadsticks are tasty.  They do not break when he dips them in his cream cheese.  I am so glad that when our grocery store stopped selling them, Amazon had them.

review/text: I've never been wild about bread sticks so when my sister served Italian with real bread for everyone else and bread sticks for me I was expecting to be disappointed--however these had a very satisfying crunch so I didn't feel mistreated at all. Now I make sure I have them on hand if I do a quick spaghetti meal. They seem as good as the wheat variety.

review/summary: For all Coffee lovers, not just those who drink Turkish
review/text: I do not drink Turkish coffee. I find it too concentrated and bitter. But I LOVE Natasha's Cairo and Beber Turkish style coffee. Why? Because you don't have to use it to make Turkish coffee! You can put it in a regular coffeemaker and it will brew regular American coffee. Use just slightly less than you would of regular ground coffee to compensate for the finer grind.<br /><br />But why would you want to do that? I'll tell you. Because Natasha's Cairo and Berber taste SO MUCH BETTER than American coffee you will be amazed. Why? Two words cardamom: (Cairo) and coriander (Berber). Both these spices suck the bitterness straight out of the coffee and leave it tasting delicious without even the slightest hint of sweetness, and de minimus calories.<br /><br />Try it just once. You will be amazed. But be forewarned. You will also  feel cheated and wonder "why oh why have I been drinking this American swill that I can only choke down with a cup of milk and a tablespoon of sugar all my life?" That's right. Black coffee doesn't have to taste bad. Try Natasha's Cairo or Berber brands and you'll find out why.<br /><br />BTW, Don't order the other brands because without cardamom or coriander Turkish coffee is even more bitter than American. And don't order the Najjar, even with cardamom. Its not the same quality as Natasha's own blends, maybe because Natasha's grinds theirs in Kentucky, not in Beirut.

I've tried some of the more mainstream Turkish Coffee's but Natashas is a step or two above the rest. If you like this try Natashas' Berber blend.

review/summary: A Good Turkish-Style Coffee
review/text: This coffee is flavored with cardamom and clove and makes for an interesting compliment to your breakfast. According to the Natasha's Cafe website, it's a blend that is closer to the taste of the coffee of the 16th and 17th centuries. I like it, but it's a variety that I couldn't drink every morning so I save it for the days I'm feeling like a change of pace.<br /><br />I find that it tastes a little better with a teaspoon of sugar than without sugar (and I normally drink my coffee without sugar!) or if you want it really sweet a single packet of Splenda or other artificial sweetener will do you well. I also think that it would taste a little more complete with a bit of cinnamon, but I understand that they were going for a very specific flavor with this coffee.<br /><br />If any of this sounds good to you, give this coffee a try. You won't regret it.

review/text: This is hands down the best coffee I've ever tasted. I recently started experimenting with Turkish Coffee and feel like I'm discovering coffee for the first time. The Berber coffee presents a variety of complex flavors and spices that make each sip a moment of joy. I've also tried the Natashas' Cairo blend which is also an excellent choice. In addition to making these the traditional way in an Ibrik, I've had success making them in a French Press. Of course the Ibrik provides a little more flavor intensity.

review/summary: All 4 cats love it
review/text: Finally, an affordable grain free single source protein for my babies. Three of my four have different feeding difficulties; one has kidney issues due to munching on an Easter lily a year ago, one came with digestive issues 3 years ago which continue to this day and the third one is just older and picky. My fourth cat will eat anything, moving or not, so she isn't the test subject the others are. Received this today and put it down, everyone gobbled without hesitation.<br /><br />Have been cutting Weruva shredded chicken with Fancy Feast Classic Chicken as the most affordable option for grain free that they would all eat. The FF wasn't exactly tolerated by itself by the cat with digestive issues, and the Weruva alone was just providing juice for my older cat (she wouldn't eat anything to speak of, just drink). Now I can stop the FF altogether, which was getting ridiculous in price for the quality. If the price stays this reasonable I will be able to transition to just this food. Trying to keep them all on a nutritious diet; 2 are 16-pounders, 1 weighs 10 pounds and the senior weighs just 8 pounds; none are overweight. You do the math; that's quite an expense in feeding them the good stuff. We had already determined that we will never have more than 2 cats at a time again due to the cost of feeding them properly; which is sad since most of our cats over the years have been 'rescues'. This food may change our mind.<br /><br />And one extra caveat...Made In the USA!<br /><br />Shipping only took a week from the outside vendor; plus if you order 2 cases (which I did today) the shipping is free.

review/summary: Great all-in-0ne batter
review/text: I found Lefty's Spices to be a good product for frying fish and chicken. It is a multi-purpose product<br />which can be used on a variety of meats. The taste is extraordinary and makes a beautiful brown crust<br />on fried meat. I found that heating the cooking oil (I used peanut oil) to 340 degrees was to hot for my<br />meats. At 340 degrees the coating browned beyond what I desired and burned. I reduced the heat to 225-250<br />degrees and obtained perfect results for my style of cooking. I did notice that it was better not to stir<br />or turn meat portions until the coating browned some (a minute or so) which prevented coating from falling<br />off meat. It is a good idea that you remove any flakes from your fryer between removal of finished meat and<br />the introduction of a new battered product. This will prevent build up in the bottom of the fryer which will<br />cause the flakes to burn and ruin your oil and meat.

review/text: SerendipiTea makes some stellar blends of different teas and herbal tisanes. This particular blend, along with its more caffeinated cousin Buccaneer, is one of the company's best. Notes of chocolate, coconut, and mint mingle together in a nice, steamy warm cup. The different flavors synchronize very well with the rooibos. As someone who generally dislikes rooibos, the nutty taste I ascribe to it isn't overwhelming in this blend.<br /><br />I like to add a little milk to this tea. Sugar would probably also work very well, but I have not tried it.<br /><br />This blend may contain trace amounts of almonds. Just a word of warning to those with food allergies.

review/summary: Real Salame Here At Last
review/text: For many years now, we have been able to enjoy real Italian prosciutto in the United States, but its close relative, salame, has been denied to us. For those of us who know about such things, American-made salame has been far, far off the mark, and barely worth eating. Now, while no real Italian products can yet be imported, three brands have filled the gap. Fra Mani, from the Napa Valley, is a good approximation, though unduly expensive, and Volpi from Saint Louis strikes close to the mark at a fair price. The real success story, however is Columbus of San Francisco, whose Artisan Collection is a joy. Salame, referred to in Italy by the broader term "salumeria", is a large family of superb dry-cured sausages, ranging from the tiny Cacciatorino (hunter's sausage) with its spicy and gamey taste, to Finocchiona, the Tuscan salame subtly flavored with fennel, to Soppressata, a coarse-grained delight from central Italy, and finally Felino, the incomparable Lombard specialty named for its town of origin. All these are now made by Columbus, and match the quality of their Italian counterparts. Try any one of them, and the illusion of false salame will be forever banished! Better still, fill a large platter with iced cantaloupe wedges, drape them with tissue-thin slicess of real prosciutto from Parma, and decorate the edges with medium-thick slices of one or more of the salami I have mentioned, and your friends and family will know true gourmet bliss!

review/summary: This tastes....familiar
review/text: I got a couple of these jelly-filled pods in a variety pack from a third party vendor.  My first impression was, quite simply, how could this possibly be good?  Boy was I in for a shock.<br /><br />The fact that I'm giving a five-star review on a coffee pod should speak volumes.  I like my coffee freshly roasted and ground, but when some flavors are added to coffee, the experience takes on an entirely different level.  I had no idea that the flavor of jelly could be infused with the flavor of coffee to create such a blissful experience.  Let's just say that it's a good thing that my variety pack only came with two pods of this flavor.  Otherwise, I might have drunk the whole package in a single day.<br /><br />The flavor and the aroma are somehow familiar, but I can't quite place them.  What I do know is that they both just simply put a smile on my face.  I would gladly go the rest of my life drinking no other coffee but this.  That's how much I like it.<br /><br />And the other thing I think needs to be pointed out is the fact that when I use Senseo pods, I have to use two pods on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.  With the Donut Shop coffees, I can use a single pod on the single cup setting to get a decently strong result.

The fact that they spelt their brand name "BIONATURAE" made it seem good as well -- I've always been a fan of delightfully old-fashined "ae" spellings of words.  So, I bought some!<br /><br />WHAT'S INSIDE....AND OUTSIDE..  It's very convenient to be able to resear the glass jar, and this is mentioned on the label! It's organic, all right -- and from Italy, as well!  And, (at least as far as the stereotype goes), Italians should know tomato paste, right?<br /><br />Yes, they do. But, being from Italy, this is a slightly different type of tomato paste than that which I am used to buying and eating in the USA.  Although the label says it contains "tomatos", and nothing else, I found the consistancy of the Bionaturae tomato sauce SLIGHTLY more watery than the soft-frosting-like consistanc I usually find in American tomato pastes.  This very-slightly more watery consistency does have advantages, though: it's easier to take out of the can...er, glass jar...and easier to mix with milk or water, or with whatever else you want to mix it.<br /><br />I use tomato paste as a hopefully-inexpensive way to make my own tomato soup, and tomato sauce -- and sometimes, (thought not very often), as a snack, all by itself!  So, before I made either tomato sauce or tomato soup, I tasted a teaspoon or so, right from the jar, to judge the flavour.  Again, there was a difference from American tomoato pastes: it was slightly less sweet.  (I guess they use a different type of tomato, for "sugar" is NOT an ingredient in this, or any other tomato paste I have bought.)  So, all by itself, being less sweet, it makes a far less satisfying snack.  However, I realize not many people use tomato paste as a snack, so -- except for the very small part of the tomato-paste buying population, such as myself, who do like to snack on tomato paste -- this isn't too impotant a factor.<br /><br />However, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted when I added ht water and milk to approximately half the jar (3 1/ 2 ounces), of this new tomato paste, added just three Splenda packets, warmed it up, and made myself about 20 ounces of tomato soup.  It tasted far more like the Campbell's tomato soup I used to drink, than tomato soup made with other brands of tomato paste I have bought -- but without any additives, preservatives, or chemicals, of course!  (I drank my nice warm tomato soup near bedtime, as I've read -- in The Green Pharamacy Guide to Foods, also available here on Amazon -- is a great way to get yourself to sleep on sleepless nights!)<br /><br />It was the same when I used Bionaturae Tomato Paste as a base for my home-made tomato sauce, to use over pasta!  It had, somehow, a more "tomato-sauce-like" flavour than the tomato sauce I have made with other tomato pastes.  Plus, of course -- in making both the tomato soup, and tomato sauce -- the slighly more liquid consistency of this particular tomato paste made it easier to mix with milk and water.  Less milk and water for the tomato sauce, more milk and water for the tomato soup.<br /><br />So, in the end, this "extra-ounce, in a glass jar" organic tomato paste is not half-bad.  I don't recommend it for those (few( others who, like me, may like to have a small can -- or glass jar -- of tomato paste as a a occasional snack.  For cooking, however, it seems an ideal little concentrate.  And concentrates -- which allow one to add one's own dilutantes, (usually water, milk, and/or seasonings), are usually a great way to save some money, not to mention eliminating chemical or other unwanted, extraneious ingredients!  It's called BIONATURAE for good reasons!  : ),

review/text: Bionaturae Organic Tomato Paste, I just started to use this Brand of Tomato Paste because of the problem with the lining in the canned tomatoes. It is made in Italy, I like it, however, I don't love it like everyone does. I found it to be a little watery and because of that it separates a bit. Maybe I am so used to the richness and thickness and creaminess and velvety smooth qualities of good old USA Tomato Paste in a can. Bionaturae Organic Tomato Paste, does not have them. I do like the glass bottles and wish that American Companies would pack their wonderful Tomato Sauce and Tomato Paste in them! Thank You

review/summary: Far and a way the "Best Buy" in truffle oil
review/text: "Full strength" truffle oils (as opposed to olive oils that claim to have truffle flavor but are much weaker) often cost $6-$10 per ounce, so you'd better hope you're getting a far superior product to this one to pay several times as much.  For the most part, you aren't.<br /><br />No matter what they call it (truffle flavor, truffle essence, natural flavors related to the truffle) all "truffle oils" - every single one of them - use fake flavoring, specifically 2,4-dithiapentane.  This is the main flavor compound found in truffles, similar to how vanillin is the main component of vanilla beans but can be made artificially.  A few oils do contain tiny amounts of real truffles, but it's just for show; a "pure" truffle oil would require hundreds of dollars worth of white truffle just to make a few ounces of flavored oil.<br /><br />If all truffle oils rely on the same compound that can be made relatively cheaply and consistently, how do the "better" truffle oils justify the higher price?  First, they package them in fancy looking tiny bottles.  Second, they use Italian olive oil as the base oil.  The goal is to suggest (falsely) that the truffle flavor comes from real Italian truffles.<br /><br />So while it's true that some truffle oils taste better than others, this is mostly (perhaps entirely) due to the quality of the oil used.  La Tourangelle uses organic safflower oil, which is nearly flavorless.  On its own, it does tastes more "chemically" than olive-oil based oils.  If it took a lot of truffle oil to flavor a dish, this might be a serious weakness.  But in reality it takes just a few drops to flavor a dish, so you're usually going to add additional fat anyway.  You can put your savings towards the premium oil of your choice.  Besides, in some dishes (eggs or mushrooms cooked in butter), you might not want olive oil flavor anyway.<br /><br />One caution/tip: like wine, "truffle essence" oxidizes and changes flavor.  So unless you plan to use the whole bottle within a month or two, it's best to keep the air out.  I filled several glass "airline size" whiskey bottles with the oil and use one at a time.  I also keep the bottles in the refrigerator, as heat and light speed up oxidation.

review/summary: extremely deceptive business practice--product made with chemicals not truffles
review/text: I am disgusted that they are allowed to get away with tricking people. There is no actual truffle used in this product but they do everything they can to convince you that there is. The ingredients say organic sunflower oil and white truffle extract. Extract makes you think it was extracted from real truffles, doesn't it? Well, it wasn't. The extract is a chemical compound manufactured in a laboratory to mimic the smell of real truffles.<br /><br />How about where it says in the label that "White truffles originate in Alba, Italy and are considered to many to be the most prestigious truffles"...do you suppose that means white truffles from Italy have anything to do with this concoction? Well, they don't. They might as well have written, "The sun is so and so many miles away from the earth." They put that sentence in just to further trick you so you think that you are getting an expensive product with a grand tradition behind it when all you are getting is some cheap oil with some synthetic chemical added to it.<br /><br />They should be ashamed of themselves. Should they be allowed to sell you a synthetic chemical to eat? Maybe. Should they be allowed to market the product to convince customers that they are getting a product made with real truffles? No, they absolutely should not. We have food laws that are supposed to protect customers from this sort of trickery. The FDA has really dropped the ball on this.<br /><br />Update: They are getting even trickier. Their label has now been changed to read truffle extract instead of truffle aroma. I called the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (see section 201 for definitions) has never defined the term extract. I was specifically told this on the phone by an FDA representative. She said because the term extract has not been legally defined by this act, anything can be called an extract. Thus, La Tourangelle can legally get away with calling something a truffle extract even if truffles weren't used to make it.

review/summary: Simply the worst truffle oil available
review/text: This product is an absolute disgrace, and how the company has the gall to call it an infused truffle oil is beyond me.  For a start, this comes in a tin, which is never a good start, and the quality of the oil used for this is appalling.  I believe it is grapeseed oil - given truffle oil is intended as a finishing, and not a cooking oil, any decent cook knows that an almost colorless, high heat oil with almost no flavor intended for cooking is a completely inappropriate choice as the base for an infused oil intended to be served cold.  The end product is pale, tasteless and almost without any aroma, let alone that of truffles.  The presentation in a tin is unattractive and also lends the oil a somewhat metallic taint...just a generally awful product.  I guess they realize that the product looks so bad that if they put it in glass they'd never sell any of it.  The only conceivable advantage of this being a cooking oil would seem to be that you might be able to burn off some of the dreadful chemical taint.<br /><br />There are numerous reviews commenting (appropriately) on the 'truffle aroma' listed in the ingredients....what an absolute crock!  This isn't an ingredient, unless it refers to the fact that a white truffle was waved somewhere in a 5 mile vicinity of the vat of oil, and there is a remote chance that some of it may have floated past. I would also say that any company that sells the number of apparently different infused oils that this company does, is hardly likely to be interested in ensuring the veracity of any one product.  If I could hazard a guess I imagine they all taste very similar, and are all created from the same dreadful base oil.<br /><br />We use truffle oil to finish dishes like risotto and scrambled eggs, so I am looking for something that is infused into a good quality base oil, with nice color, and has an aroma that even if it is not naturally derived (one review suggests truffle flavor never is), it certainly smells like it.  I don't think you can go past the Bartolini brand (available on this site).  It uses extra virgin olive oil as a base, has a small piece of truffle visible in the bottle, which certainly smells like truffle, and it looks and smells great on food, which surely is the point. My advice, avoid the Tourangelle at all costs and give the Bartolini a try instead.

However, if you want a strong truffle flavor and use a lot of this oil, then you will have a dish that smells like machine oil and still lacks a dense truffle taste.<br /><br />Looking at the oil from the top of a full can, you will notice small dark oil droplets suspended in an ocean of safflower oil. There's not many dark drops, which is the active ingredient. So you are really buying an expensive bottle of safflower oil. And when was the last time you remember eating truffles which looked like motor oil looking drops in your dish? There is a reason it comes in a dark metal can. Enough said, try another brand.<br /><br />Bottom line = yuck

review/text: I agree with another reviewer who has used Roland oils in the past.  I was drawn in by the good reviews for this product, and it was inexpensive enough that I thought I would give it a shot.  When you open the tin, you are greeted by a strong whiff of truffle essence, but it is not durable, and in food, the flavor is almost nonexistent.  I don't know whether the artificial essence is simply more volatile in the oil that La Tourangelle uses since it is much lighter than the olive oil of the Roland Brand, but I find that since one uses small quantities at a time, I'd rather pay a bit more and get a flavor that lasts on the walk from the kitchen counter where I've drizzled the oil (on the food, not the counter of course -- although that would go a long way to explaining the lack of flavor) to the time I get the dish to the table.

This may or may not be true.  White truffle "flavor" sounds more likely to be chemical, though it need not be. Extract, however, sounds like it is from the real thing.<br /><br />From the label, searches on Google, Wikipedia, and the manufacturer's website, I found no indication that this extract is from artificial and chemical procedures. The best I can conclude, therefore, is that the source of this truffle thing is quite mysterious.<br /><br />Without evidence to the contrary, I am not unwilling to believe that the company is complying with FDA and FTC regulations. They have reputation at risk, which is essential to their business.<br /><br />To conclude:<br />I don't think it is the best tasting merchandise available. I do believe that the quality is reasonable for the price.

review/summary: Sound product and a great buy
review/text: I first bought this reluctantly out of dire need and was really surprised at how good it is. I've bought many, many bottles of very expensive white truffle oils in glass and and have returned several completely dead ones over the years. While I generally favor products in glass, the truffle aroma is an incredibly volatile (anyone who has left a bottle of truffle oil in a cupboard for a few months has probably noticed most of the aroma has dissipated) one and possibly labile under exposure to light. In any case, I've never had a dead bottle of this brand. Also, I have for years stored my truffle oil in the fridge; great to preserve the aroma but, if the carrier oil is olive, this poses a big problem of convenience as olive oil will harden under refrigeration.<br /><br />The big benefit of La Tourangelle is in fact the safflower carrier oil a it does not harden at refrigerator temperature or, if it does, it does so over weeks or months and I usually reach for mine every few days. Also, I just think it silly to bash this stuff for the neutral character of its carrier oil as I'm using truffle oil for truffle aroma. If I want really good EVOO character I'd rather choose the oil myself rather than leave that decision up to the truffle oil producer (and what is the likelihood that someone who doesn't specialize in olive oil is going to use the best one).<br /><br />Ignore the misinformed food snobs. Buy this, use it, store it in the fridge between uses.

review/summary: Best one I've used
review/text: I've tried every brand of white truffle oil, including the most expensive in the tiniest bottles.  Every one other than this fades almost instantaneously (if it had any truffle flavor to begin with--had many 'duds').  I went to the point of using my commercial vac-packer to seal the oils in left over caviar jars to try and preserve them.  This helped a bit but once opened they went to nothing very quickly.<br /><br />Tourangelle, on the other hand, I have left in the bottle and used over several months and it retains its flavor.  I've noticed no real difference in its truffle flavor compared to more expensive brands (which makes sense since they're all artificial).  Is it the same as 'real' white truffle?  No, of course not.  Real truffle costs hundreds of dollars per ounce.<br /><br />So, for me this is the only truffle oil I'm going to buy from now on.  I suspect some negative comments are coming from people who believe the really expensive oils are real truffle, creating a placebo effect (or perhaps they're shills for other oils?).  They are not real truffle.  Tourangelle participates to some degree in the fakery just as the others do, but at least they're not putting exactly the same thing (in terms of essential ingredient) in a tiny bottle to make you think it's special and charging you ten times more for it.

review/summary: Loses its 'truffle-iness" over time.
review/text: When I first purchased this (and the black) truffle oil, they added very nice flavor to pizzas, pastas etc. Several months later, neither had any truffle aroma or flavor remaining.<br /><br />Most truffle oils don't aren't infused with real truffles, but with a chemical compound instead. My guess is that if you find a fairly fresh oil, you will be pleased but be aware they seem to have a short shelf life.

review/summary: Truffle oil is fine
review/text: I bought the truffle oil to add distinctive subtle taste to certain foods.The infusion white truffle oil does add this earthy taste. It is a powerful taste and can be a turn off very quickly with too much, in that respect. You need to try it several times with not too much, not too little. (very much like saffron). This La Toursangelle oil is a good oil. Other truffle oils have a bit of the carrier oil taste. I don't have enough experience to compare all the truffle oils. I would use this truffle oil again but not to the exclusion of others.<br /><br />t

review/text: This might not be the most expensive "truffle oil", but it serves it's purpose well.  I use this for my parmesan truffle popcorn and for my truffle infused mac n' cheese.  Of all the kinds I've bought before, this is the only brand that I'd buy again.  Very happy with the purchase.  :)

review/summary: Expensive taste for not so much
review/text: This year I have expanded my cooking by adding new flavors to my cooking easel.  One such addition was White Truffle Oil.  My friend is an avid mushroom hunter in the bay area and one day while wandering around San Francisco, he picked up a small tincture of White Truffle Oil for about $14.  I imagine he got about 3-4 fl oz for that buy.<br /><br />We went back to his place and he cooked up some instant mashed potatoes and threw in a splash of the oil.  Long story short, changed my potato eating life.  It was shameful to admit that those instant mashed potatoes resulted in the best I had eaten up to that point.<br /><br />So, when I got home, I perused Amazon and came across this.  What I imagined to be 8.5 oz of oil turned out to be 17 oz for the same price.  Great deal.  I told my buddy and he was irate as he had spent app. 300% of what I did to get what he got.<br /><br />Great buy.

review/text: I last tasted truffles in Spoletto, Italy 16 years ago and was none impressed. Clueless on how to best use an Amazon Gift Card, I lived dangerously and (with low expectations) ordered this oil and the truffle salt. Needless to say, I was delighted and surprised at the taste sensation when added to Mac and Cheese or even a steak. Live well, without breaking the bank.

review/summary: Not for me..
review/text: I saw a recipe that everyone was raving about and one of the steps was to use this oil. I had never Truffle oil before and was curious. I purchased this one since it seemed to be a decent seller with ok reviews.<br /><br />As soon as I open the container I thought phoowa.. that is different and not in a nice way.  I went ahead anyway and used the oil hoping that once cooked it might infused some wonderful favour into the dish. It didn't.  The taste was exactly how it smelled and it practically turned my stomach. I have an iron clad stomach and rarely does something make me feel ill.<br /><br />I have given it 4 stars because I am sure the product itself is exactly what is being presented. I am just letting people know that if you have never tried Truffle oil before, it might not be to your liking.  I can't imagine using the oil again, it really did not settle well for me.

review/summary: Indestructable!
review/text: I have a lab puppy, and for any of you who have read my other reviews, I LOVE idestructable toys, as my puppy is a very strong chewer. After demolishing several smaller bones and puppy kongs, I decided to buy this bone, hoping it really would be good for a strong chewer. It has proved to be everything that Nylabone says it would be. He likes it, and has barely "made a dent" in it. There are plenty more play hours to be spent with this toy, and we've had it for several months.<br /><br />Recommended for labs, retreivers, and other big dogs who love to chew!

review/summary: Ok if you use with supervision....
review/text: We have a 70lb lab mix (9 months old) and is notorious for destroying "virtually indestructable" toys. We have spend a lot of money trying to find one that would last more than a few minutes without getting pieces off of it. Unfortunately this is one of those toys we bought and literally within 5 minutes he had worn deep grooves in one end and within 10 minutes he was carving small pieces off of it. Although to be fair, this bone lasted longer than most that we bought. This is definitely not a toy for an unsupervised dog.

review/text: I researched this bone for days before finally deciding to spend the money on it.  I brought it home to my 85 pound Doberman and he was so excited about it.  When I finally got it out of the packaging, my dog didn't care at all about the bone- he just wanted to play/eat the package.  I spent time playing with him and the bone to create interest, but still nothing.  It now sits in the bottom of his toy box.

review/summary: Mutilator Approved!
review/text: It's been about a 1-1/2 years since my first review of the Big Chew and I'm happy to report that it is still going strong with our dog. It definitely shows sign of wear and tear but it's obvious that this bone will be around for a long time. Definitely a must chew toy for your mega-jaw dog. Doggie approved and mama's wallet is happy.<br /><br />* * * *<br /><br />I've nicknamed my dog "The Mutilator" because there are VERY few toys that he cannot destroy in 10 minutes or less. The Mutilator means business when it comes to his high-prey playtime.<br /><br />Needless to say, I have become a skeptic when it comes to "tough" toys. Nonetheless, even though he has mutilated toys that look similar to Big Chews, I decided to give this one a shot.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that after one month of full-time mutilator mode, our chow/lab/st bernard mix has barely made a dent in his Big Chew beef bone. I'm a believer! The only problem I have now is keeping him away from the couch cushions when he can't remember where he hid his Big Chew. :)

review/summary: sled dog owner
review/text: My husband and I have a team of recreational sled dogs, they can chew through absolutely anything, we have tried many toys...and have ended up with bowel obstructions!!  This nylabone is wonderful, the dogs have worn it down a bit, but the grooves they have worn are superficial and combined with the rough patches,it works great as a teeth cleaner as well as a chew toy...it is very hard to brush a sled dogs teeth!  They have not broken off large chunks and the small pieces that do come off are able to pass through without harm, as the package insert indicates.  There are no toys that will not wear, but this is hands down the best product I have found for my pups.

review/text: We've had this bone for about a year now, with my 70 lb. Labrador only using it occasionally.  She preferred her Nylabone Nylaknot to this one, probably because the larger end is harder for her to get her mouth around.  She still likes it, and it has proven to be fairly indestructible.  I haven't seen any chunks break off like some of the smaller chews we've tried.  Great Product.

Of course, the whole "melt in your mouth, not in your hand" thing, a lie. But a catchy lie.<br /><br />I like the candies but stopped buying them when my son was a year old because he almost choked on one. Now that he's 19... well, it's time to return to my favorites! Ok, I could've returned earlier, I'm pretty sure he knows to chew his food now. M&Ms are a good old standard for the candy bowl! Hardly worth buying online, unfortunately, considering the shipping charges, but if you can find free shipping or get a deal on that, go for it.<br /><br />- AnnaLovesBooks

The leaves are quite large, making it convenient to brew a pot without worrying about a lot of little bits getting in your cup. By the time it brews, most of the leaves have settled to the bottom. Also a stronger tea than other loose leafs.

(My first sight of the monastery where they're made - a replica of the mother-house in Europe, on a picturesque hilltop in Massachusetts - swept me into a historical reverie that was interrupted when I realized what the habited monk on the red tile roof was doing: fixing one of the solar panels powering the jelly factory. You can read more about some unique features of the process on the Amazon site.)<br /><br />And the money you spend actually goes to support the life and work of the monks.

review/summary: 6-Jar Variety Pack Trappist Monks Preserves
review/text: DELICIOUS!!!  A wonderful set of flavors and a nice way to support the church.  Just wish this product was a little cheaper because it comes from workers in a religious organization that is not payrolled.  The only things that would make me choose different Cmas gifts this year would be the shipping fees.  If Trappist issues gift cards, that might be the way to shop until our economy stabilizes.

review/summary: too bad it has corn syrup
review/text: I was getting ready to purchase this product but the fact that contains corn syrup make me change my mind. Many of us are having issues with corn syrup. I appreciate the fact that they disclosed all ingredients before I placed the order. Hope this could change in the future.

review/summary: Delicious topping with Japanese flair!
review/text: I know, some of you may be thinking, GROSS! Fish shavings?? But if you like fish, and the flavors of Japanese food, then you'll love these Bonito Flakes. This brand's individual packages is very convenient and ensures that you always have the freshest serving.<br /><br />Bonito flakes are part of the base soup stock in miso soup, so you've probably had a taste of it without even knowing it. Don't think they are only good for stocks, however. The flakes themselves are a delicious addition to a block of cold tofu with some soy sauce, and also on a bowl of steamed rice, again with a little soy sauce. They are also great when mixed with fresh cucumber slices and soy sauce. If you're getting the drift, they are much more flavorful when a drizzle of soy sauce is added too.<br /><br />Bonito flakes, called "hanakatsuo" in Japanese, are a fabulous source of protein and are a quick and easy way to add a lot of taste to even a plain bowl of rice. I guess if you purchase some and don't agree with my review, you can follow the lead of one of the other reviewers and feed it to your cats...

review/summary: What this stuff really tastes like...
review/text: I love bonito flakes. I'll tell you why - they taste like bacon to me. There is no religious reason for me NOT to eat bacon; however, these give you that smokey flavor of bacon without the fakey smoked tasted of turkey bacon or just that liquid smoke stuff. I love bacon, I love bonito flakes and have become addicted to dashi, the basic Japanese broth they use in almost everything.<br /> It's much more natural, it's delicious, it's not like anything else. I have yet to come across 'artificial bonito flakes' - that should tell you something.

review/summary: wierd initially
review/text: This is an unusual food product if you are not familiar, but once used, it is nearly essential. It adds so much flavor and body to soups and broth and I liked another reviewers comment that to her it is like 'bacon'....very true. It soon becomes an essential that you want to dust onto everything....greatly expands your food..especially grains and soups.

review/summary: Exactly as expected
review/text: I'm not sure of the other reviewer's expectations, but I ordered this having grown up eating this stuff every time I visited my grandparents.  It was exactly as I remembered: pickled herring as they do all over (coastal) Europe.  Fish fillets are supposed to be mushy, and the fact it's warm is normal, since it was transported outside (unless in winter, maybe).  They're pickled, essentially, so they won't spoil.  I've always had them served cold, and with some vegetable accompaniment, like onion.  So, anyway, these were ordered to be added to a snack table at a wedding, and every single one was gobbled up without any complaints during or afterward. If you want herring, this is a fine place to order from.  If you're just gambling on a fish treat, like the other reviewer, you need to keep an open mind. This is a fine product, and the 1 star reviewer should probably stick to fish the way the serve it at McDonald's or Long John Silver's.

review/summary: Be aware of what your buying!  Requires constant refrigeration.
review/text: I am double posting this review for both the thick cut and filet versions of this product. So you may see it twice -- YES, I did order BOTH products.<br /><br />1) This product comes COLD packed - read this next part carefully: This is a cold product - IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED, because it has no preservatives. Make certain you have ROOM in your fridge for the jar(s) which are slightly different than the one pictured (thinner diameter straight wide-mouth jar and taller, which makes then easier to fit in the fridge).<br /><br />2) If you don't normally consume this product in this form (packed in wine sauce) then don't buy it.  It would probably be considered to be an "acquired taste" by most. Buy a small jar in a local grocery first to try. If you like it then order this larger jar.<br /><br />3) This brand does taste stronger than other brands I have tried. The fish taste is stronger on the thick cut product.  My guess is that would diminish over time while marinating in the "wine" and onion based brine.<br /><br />4) I suggest you try one jar before buying 5 like I did. Remember IT MUST BE KEPT REFRIGERATED -- it can NOT be stored without being refrigerated in a pantry.<br /><br />5)This brand is  pricey with shipping costs.  You may be able to purchase locally if you don't require Canadian packed herring.<br /><br />6) Eating fish may be good for you, and if you like this type of product, it might be an easy way to consume larger amounts of Omega fats other than downing supplements.  You could live longer, but you will need to brush your teeth or chew gum more, or you may become an old person with fish breath. ;)<br /><br />Finally I should note that this was the second shipment sent, but I never saw the first box which I was told was damaged during delivery.  I was contacted by Parthenon Foods and offered refund or re-delivery -- no hassles.  So they are very easy to work with and have good communication. I would other other products from them again.  (I HAVE ENOUGH HERRING IN MY FRIDGE TO LAST A WHILE! ;)

review/summary: bad
review/text: When I recieved the herring it was warm. I opened the jar and the fish was warm and mushy. There was also not a lot of herring in the jar. It wouldn't be a good buy even if the herring was edible. I threw it right into the garbage.<br />This product should not be shipped if it can't be protected from spoilage.

review/summary: Mouthwatering Delicious!
review/text: I was out grocery shopping yesterday and for the first time I saw this sauce. I usually don't try new things but since it was only a little under $3 where I was shopping I decided to pick it up and I am so glad I did. It is by far hands down the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted in my 25 years of existence. My husband also says this is the best he has ever tasted and thought it was made in the south because of the flavor. For a non-homemade sauce this is the best there is. Honestly it's hard to tell that it is even factory made. The creators who from what I read are a couple of Chicago natives definitely know what they are doing, and I am interested to try other products from them now as well.

review/summary: ONLY bottled sauce I'll buy and here's how I use it with ribs, chicken
review/text: When I have time, I make my own sauce. But that takes time and hours of simmering the sauce for the best flavor. I never thought I'd  dare use a bottled sauce..<br /><br />But Ray's is so delicious that I now reach for it most of the time, especially during grilling season. This sauce is yummy right out of the bottle. I  pour it over ribs and chicken as they cook and as a basting sauce or topping for meatloaf.  Plenty ask for my sauce recipe which has me wondering why I ever bother making the homemade...but I still like it too..even though the Ray.s gives it a run for the money.<br /><br />As a strong believer in seasoning food as I cook, there are times when I've added a bit of honey or sugar to this sauce. If I have an urge for something spicier, I might add some red pepper or a touch of Tobasco. I err on the side of less rather than more when it comes to hot sauces.<br /><br />My "never fail"  rib cooking technique is not unique but took awhile for me to embrace.This was mainly because I like to try all sorts of cooking techniques- from slow cooker to using a smoker - before I settle on a favorite.<br /><br /> I'm still eager for new rib recipes and cooking techniques but for now the following recipe is both easy and satisfying for our family and friends:<br /><br />1. For ribs, buy as many pounds as you usually need per person, the thicker the better. Allow for shrinkage while cooking so get a bit more if you son't cook ribs often or are new to this.<br /><br />2. Boil the ribs for 2-3 hours ( go take a nap,or read a book or garden or something during this time). . If the ribs are thin, you can get by with less time, maybe even as little as an hour. Stop when they are tender but not falling off the bone. Trust me, they will be tender before you are done cooking them.<br /><br />3. Pour sauce over them and cook at 325 until they literally fall off the bone or are fork tender.<br /><br />Cover with foil if they start to get too brown on top. If you are aiming for something to use in sandwiches, pull the meat apart, mix with sauce and use with toasted hamburger buns or your bread of choice. I saut&eacute; some onions to throw on the buns too.

review/summary: My favorite non-homemade BBQ sauce
review/text: Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce is my favorite store bought BBQ sauce.  I have tried many, and normally I would mix different sauces to get it the way I like it.  Sweet Bay Ray's got it right, just the way I like it.<br /><br />The sauce is thick, sweet, and has a touch of spicy.  I mainly use it on pulled pork, but it is also great on ribs too.  I think it goes great with the food I cook because I use spicy dry rubs, so the sweetness of this sauce gives it a great combination of flavor.  But if you like sweet, then this sauce works great all by itself.

review/summary: best sauce ever sold!
review/text: With the exception of an old sauce made by Adam's Barbecue in Wichita, KS, which is no longer there, this is absolutely the best sauce I've ever eaten.  It is, hands down, the best barbecue sauce on the market.  I'm considered a pretty terrific cook, and have made a lot of barbecue in my years, so am pretty much an expert on this.  The Hickory is my favorite, but whichever you choose, you can't go wrong.
