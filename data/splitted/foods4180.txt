review/summary: Here are the actual ingredients from the package...
review/text: Ingredients: Spices, salt, onion, paprika, garlic, dextrose, vegetable oil (partially hydrogenated soybean oil to help protect flavor), corn syrup solids, silicon dioxide (anticaking agent).<br /><br />Dad was the plant engineer at Stegner food products in Cincinnati, on a private drive they named "Chili Hill" so I think I can translate here. First and foremost you're buying their proprietary blend of spices, which they don't have to list individually, then salt (some really good spice blends I've tried advertise being salt free which makes them a better value, but this brand is a Cincinnati staple and including the salt is normal). Onion makes it unnecessary to chop one, paprika is a given in Cincinnati chili, I assume garlic also. Some Cincinnati chili recipes include chocolate by the way.<br /><br />Anyway after that dextrose is referred to as "grape sugar" on wikipedia, and the soybean oil has to be hydrogenated to be incorporated into a powdered mix. One packet will serve a family for dinner and contains:<br /><br />32g TOTAL grams of Carbs per packet, 8 grams of which is fiber and 8 grams of which is sugar.<br />4 TOTAL grams of fat, so no big deal on the hydrogenated oil unless you REALLY hate the stuff.<br />8 TOTAL grams of protein.<br /><br />So a little bit of "grape sugar," naturally being a processed food a smidge of corn syrup sludge, and a tiny amount of silicon dioxide, which sounds a lot like some kind of sand-like molecule to me, not exactly appetizing but the last ingredient on the list and surely harmless.<br /><br />All you need to make the chili itself is 6oz of tomato paste and a pound of ground beef, and you don't even brown the ground beef, how easy is that? All in all considering how unhealthy the MSG and BPA in canned chilis and soups are, and the much higher price and limited availability of other Cincinnati Chili recipes, the convenience of this mix make it worth buying. As I understand it none of these ingredients can 'disguise' MSG (there are at least half a dozen ingredients that don't say MSG but can contain MSG).<br /><br />I made my first batch with two packets, 2lbs of beef, 2 cans of tomato paste, and a 1lb bag of pre-soaked Chana Dal beans, which have just about the lowest glycemic index of any carb source out there. It drew raves, but as much as like this mix for now if/when I get the time I'd like to look up recipes with chocolate in them, mix my own spices, chop an onion, mince the garlic, (stew a tomato? slaughter a cow?), and see how good the chili can get.

It is quite different than when you make chili down here in Texas where I live now, but I really missed going to Skyline or Gold Star so I whipped me up a batch at home and the taste brought me back. I love living in Texas but I missed some of the things you can get readily in Cincinnati like their chili and Goetta.

review/summary: A good decaf Earl Grey, superb service
review/text: Decaf tea can be a disappointing experience, and while not perfect, Mighty Leaf makes the best Earl Grey Decaf I've tasted.  Finding it can be difficult and finding it in loose leaf can be a real challenge.  In fact, I could not find loose leaf from anywhere else.  A pound is a lot, but making a pot every morning, I'm going through it fasater than I thought I would. The zip lock foil bag it comes in seems pretty airtight, although I transfered it to a sealed cannister.<br /><br />Ok, so the tea is good, the price is good.  The company fulfilling the order, The Beverage Gourmet, was above and beyond the call.  I had very prompt delivery and thought there was a problem with my order.  Turns out there wasn't, but the folks at The Beverage Gourmet were extremely responsive and courteous.  I will certainly look to them first for any future tea or coffee related purchases.

review/summary: Bil-Jac is the best
review/text: My dogs go crazy for these. It's what I give them everytime we come in from outside. I've always given them a treat since they were puppies when I was potty training them, so they are so used to getting a treat when they come inside. They sit and wait lined up in a row like little soldiers waiting for their Bil-jac. It's the cutest thing to watch cuz they just love them to death!! They love all of the Bil-jac flavors too, not just these.<br /><br />What I like most about these is the price. They are very reasonable. So I stock up on them whenever I can especially because these treats don't last very long in my house, so I am always buying more.<br /><br />If you are ever looking for something just like these, the tractor supply store has a similar brand called "retriever". They are the same as these, just a little smaller and are a good price like these too. I buy both of them whenever I can, especially when I see them go on sale because dog treats are not cheap!

review/summary: hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options
review/text: My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is "made with liver".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken "by-products"-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide.

review/text: The dog loved these treats while doing his therapy exercises but they reeked havoc on his digestive system.  Vomited after one day and had diarrhea for days after that.  I stopped using them after right away. Note: The treats I purchased did not have corn syrup listed in the ingredients.  I have seen some advertised with and without.  So, if your dog's stomach can handle them, they are great.  If not, take a pass.  BTW he ate a different brand of liver product treats with no problem.

Which is what we try the most to steer clear of and what steered us towards these preserves in the first place. Another plus is it's made in France.<br /><br />If I ever meat Bonne Maman I hope to give her a nice French Kiss.

review/text: This is my favorite brand of preserves and the blueberry is my favorite flavor. It tastes like real fruit and has no HFCS. The flavors are strong an less is needed; you might find it overwhelming if you put on as much as you do of most brands. Highly recommended, but Amazon's price is high; I can find it locally for ~$4, and occasionally at a discount store for ~$2.

review/text: for a gourmet jam, I expected this to be less sweet and more fragrant. a teaspoon of this stuff is enough to sweeten 6oz of greek yogurt, and greek yogurt is the only kind of yogurt that can stand up to it. it's also alright on a waffle, assuming you skip the syrup. other than that I really don't know what to do with it, the sweetness is just so overpowering.

review/summary: They fixed the seals but lost the Bold. Bummer.
review/text: Sadly, the bad seal problem was almost worth the bold cup of decaf. It would appear that Timothy's decided to put less coffee in to fix the over pressure problem that was breaking seals during brewing. The coffee is still tasty but only if you brew a small, or at most med. cup, and don't add too much cream. In fact, they should drop the Extra Bold designation from this pod because it no longer is. Disappointed.<br /><br />Original review:<br />We have this on Subscribe and save because it is a really good strong cup of decaf. Our latest shipment has had a lot of ruptured seals during brewing. I would say one third to one half. Maybe a bad batch?

review/text: I'm looking for a bold decaf and this was suggested to me.  Seeing the words "Espresso" and "Extra-Bold" in there I figured it had to have some "punch."  Sadly no. "Extra-Bold" it is not.  I'd have trouble even suggesting "Boldly-Mild."  I have to set my machine to the lowest of the 3 settings and it's still not a satisfying coffee.  I wish it was possible to have a mixed box of decaf coffees to sample: Buying 24 or 48 K-cups at a time is not the best way to try out the unknowns!  :-)

review/text: As a lover of "bold" coffees who is trying to limit his caffeine intake somewhat, I tried this coffee.  I guess I'll never know why they still can't make a decaff that's as good as regular, but I guess that's the trade off.  Overall, Timothy's isn't bad, it's just no where near as bold as you might expect of a blend labeled "espresso."  It's more of a medium roast than dark but it's not horrible.

review/summary: Excellent for decaf
review/text: Timothy's Decaf Rainforest Espresso Extra-Bold and Emeril's K-cups, Jazzed Up Decaf show that great coffee can be made from decaf K-Cups.  Both are rich and full bodied with ample taste and aroma.  I'm not sure which I like better at this point but you can't go wrong with either if you drink decaf.  Actually, it would be difficult to to know you are drinking decaf unless you looked at the K-Cup.  Moreover, there is no buzz with this decaf, unlike some other decaf coffees which still have a lot of caffeine.

Instead what I got was the equivalent of a supermarket, off the shelf, canned coffee. You know the type, weak, no flavor, stale, so thin you can see through it. If you like supermarket, canned coffee then this is for you. If  you're looking for an Espresso, Stay Away! This isn't it.

review/summary: Nice bold, blend. People don't know it's decaf.
review/text: I love coffee, but I gave up caffeine so I'm always on the hunt for a good robust blend. I think this is a great espresso- not bitter, rich and full bodied. The K-cup allows me to brew a 6 oz cup of some great coffee in our Keurig Platinum. This espresso is also wonderful iced, using the iced drink setting of 3.25 oz brewed directly over ice. At 3.25 oz, I'm almost getting a double shot out of 1 k-cup.<br /><br />Is this coffee as good as freshly ground, tamped down in my espresso maker? No, but this deliver system doesn't claim to be. It does deliver a bold espresso taste in a very convenient form. I've served cappuccino portions (4oz) after dinner and people were concerned with having caffeine after dinner, surprised when they were told it was decaf. Hubby brews this decaf along with a Mocha K cup (tastes mostly like chocolate) and enjoys his own version of a mocha.<br /><br />The 2 pack price is great and we are enjoying more coffee at home and less espresso drinks out, at the savings of $3-$4 per drink.

review/summary: Great coffee--pricing disaster
review/text: This extra-bold decaf is one of the best tasting K-cup varieties, especially in the decaf space.  The price over time, however, is all over the place and buyers must be cautious.  More than a year ago, I began ordering this variety under Amazon's Subscribe and Save program at about $20 for a pack of two 24-count boxes.  Later, with no apparent rationale other than supply and demand, the price shot up to $38.  I immmediately started using other decaf K-cups.  During this time, I saw a listing that appeared identical to this Timothy's variety that I had been ordering at about $20, only to learn when it was delivered that it only included only ONE 24-count box and not two as before.  Effectively a 100% price increase!!  Nice try, but I quickly sent it back as misleading and not as described. Recently, the price came down again to about $23 for two boxes, although no longer available under Subscribe and Save.  Still, it is a great product so I placed orders over the past couple of months.  Now, after a couple of months, at the end of April 2011, the price has again risen to $38.  Is this a "bait-and-switch" tactic by Amazon or its supplier thinking that buyers won't notice the price increase?  The coffee deserves 4 to 5 stars but the misleading pricing brings my rating down to 2 stars.

review/text: This stuff is horrid. It says it is Extra-Bold, but it is more like dishwater. It is so thin you can see through it and the flavor is lousy.  (Espresso is not only a strength, it is supposed to be a flavor. Not here!)  To be clear, I LOVE my Keurig machine. I use it happily with Newman's Own, Sumatra, and regular French Roast. So, while I do like strong coffee, I am normally happy with what is sold for this machine.  But now I am stuck with all these servings of stuff I am never going to use.  Even the Donuts decaf is better than this.  I buy tons of stuff from Amazon but this is the first time that I have been unhappy enough to write a review.

It could still be a bit stronger, but the flavor is good, not harsh or excessively acidic.  It holds up well to the addition of a modest amount of milk or cream.  (Or, even better, a tablespoon or two of Trader Joe's Coffee Espresso Ice Cream. :>) )<br /><br />Try it if you drink decaf.  It's the only one that I keep reordering.

We have used a number of other brands, and never had this problem before.<br /><br />After I posted this, I contacted GMCR Specialty Coffee Business Unit.  I didn't expect anything other than denial that it could be their packaging.  What a pleasant surprise.  I got a very prompt and courteous response and they have agreed to replace the entire order.

The problem I had with this batch is that several of them had holes or the seal wasn't good.  So when the coffee started to "brew" in its cup, it overflowed in the brewer and there were leaky grounds and a mess everywhere.  Not a good thing.  Several in this batch have done this and because of this, I won't order it again.  I read a review that said maybe there was too much coffee in the k-cup causing it to build up too much pressure.... whatever it is, believe me, you don't want that mess.

review/summary: Timothy's K-Cup Rainforest Decaf Expresso
review/text: Probably as close to a steam machine expresso as you will find.  I love the convenience of the Keurig brewer, and recommend it to the expresso lover wanting convenience.  It's decaf without loss of flavor intensity.

review/summary: A great brew
review/text: Lately I have been making half-caf cups of coffee throughout the day to cut back. The problem is that the only K-cups that are half caf are from Green Mountain and they are pretty lame. I'd rather use a single cup and not waste a second one for a single cup of coffee, but alas, not an option. So if you want bold coffee, then you need to burn two cups - one that is decaf. These really do the trick. If you have a good strong cup of regular (I like the Rainforest regular), then this compliments it perfectly and you'd never know you are drinking weaker (caf-wise) brew.

It isn't easy to get a bold flavor without bitterness from decaf, but Timothy's has done a great job.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for decaf with a well rounded robust flavor.

review/text: This is my go-to decaf. Delicious and comforting. I start out my day with one cup of full caff and then switch to decaf. With the Timothy's Decaf Rainforest Expresso, I don't feel I have downgraded taste from the full caff. It fools every full-caff-only guest I give it to. I am on auto delivery for it and will be forever. BTW Amazon's auto delivery K Cup options are awesome. I used Green Mountain Coffee Roasters for years but recently cancelled that program due to Amazon's great Timothy's coffees and super-simple ordering process.

review/text: OK, I admit it. My name is Ashtar and I'm a caffeine-oholic.<br /><br />I'm so addicted to caffeine, that I have to drink coffee before going to sleep, otherwise I *can't* sleep.<br /><br />You heard me. I mean, what's wrong with this picture? Sometimes, I wake up around 3.30 AM, shaking like a leaf in a storm, not knowing what hit me. It's because I haven't been drinking coffee, stupid!<br /><br />As you might imagine, I consider decaf to be the most silly invention in world history, with the possible exception of beer without alcohol (!). Several people have kindly informed me, that decaf is for those who like the taste of coffee, but don't like to get stoned by the caffeine.<br /><br />I beg you pardon? Are there people who actually *like* the taste of coffee????<br /><br />Let's get this one straight. Coffee doesn't taste good. It tastes like...well, the moderator won't let me tell you. It's only redeeming quality is the caffeine.<br /><br />You Americans are a strange breed. You live in slivers, celebrate incomprehensible holidays such as "Halloween" and "Labor Day", and...drink decaf.<br /><br />Well, at least you vote Democrat. Always something.

review/summary: Keep It Raw
review/text: This is the best assortment of flavored oils I have been able to find online.  There are good reasons to buy flavored oils prepared by a reputable manufacturer than to make your own; if not filtered properly these kinds of oils can harbor botulism  (particularly if you are infusing olive oil with garlic).  Each bottle is 8.5 ounces, which will leave you wanting more.  This suggests  that the oils are best used in vinaigrettes, as a finishing oil (on pasta, fish, meat), or some other raw application rather than in cooking, which could absorb too much for too little flavor.  Oddly, in the box the shipper did not include any advertising on their products or other paperwork that would enable the buyer to order more and in greater quantities - a missed opportunity!

review/summary: Organic, Low Sugar & No Artificial Sugar - Finally!
review/text: We eat healthy. That means my kids drink very little juice and zero soda. By very little I mean I never buy it, they might have some at a friend's house or a party or something. Generally they drink only milk or water. But that means they feel left out when the other kids have sugar-filled juice boxes or caprisuns. Enter Honest Kids! Yes, they have sugar in them, that's what I like. Go look at a box of 'Roaring waters' - that has artificial sweeteners (and sugar too, something I never could quite figure out). I would rather my children had a small amount of real sugar than artificial sweeteners. Since they are used to drinking only water otherwise, they like these, they don't complain they taste watered down. In fact if you compare these to a typical CapriSun, its kind of like the difference between a Vitamin Water and Gatorade. When you are used to Vitamin water, (original) Gatorade is going to taste sickly sweet, if you are used to Gatorade, Vitamin water is going to taste like water with slight flavor. Ask yourself which you want your children to be used to?<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers complain that they are hard to open or messy - my 6 and 8 year olds have no problems with them.  They put the straw in themselves and don't have a problem spilling them.<br /><br />Now they don't feel left out when everyone else has a juice box, and I feel good about the amount of sugar they are taking in. At only 40 calories and no artificial sweeteners, this is exactly what I've been looking for!

They were very overpriced but our family loves them so we were willing to pay the extra money just to have them in the house.  these tasted completely different then the bulk ones and like they were packed in plastic forever ago.  I do not recommend buying these especially if you have had Sunridge Farms pretzels in the past.
