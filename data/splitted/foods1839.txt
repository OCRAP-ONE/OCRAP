review/summary: Single Father needs all the help he can get...
review/text: I am loving being a father... and despite my best culinary attempts, pasta with olive oil or mac'n'cheese; how do I get her to eat the veggies? I bought this as a snack, but after last nights overly cooked veggies, found that they can be good side dishes as well.<br /><br />My little one likes the the green A LOT vs the yellow, just bought the brown; we will let you know.  So far, HUGE success.  Great for lunch on the go or to make up for a single man's cooking.  Either way a must have in winning the war that is meal time with a toddler.

review/summary: My child LOVES this!
review/text: I purchased these in hopes of my younger son eating some veggies. (he refuses veggies of any kind)  I was hesitant because he really didn't like the gerber grabbers but a friend recommended this brand and flavor.  I tried it and he loves them!!!  I like the fact it's dual veggies plus a fruit.  I will freeze one and pull it out in the morning. By lunchtime it's a nice slushy treat.

The pouches are convenient to pack and go. Great line of kid's food products.

review/text: I just tried these Peter Rabbit Organics for the first time this month. I'm always a little skeptical of non-refigerated foods in pouches, but I was pleasantly surprised to find these taste fresh and really are healthy. My two year old is just learning to drink from a straw, so he has fun drinking these "smoothies." His favorites are definitely the sweeter ones like Carrot, Squash and Apple and Sweet Potato, Corn and Apple. Perfect for traveling and on-the-go.

She can be a picky vegetable eater but these 'smoothies' as she calls them seem to work well for her. We have them delivered every month as 10 packs usually last us that long (we only give her a couple of these a week so she does not get tired of the taste.) We really like that it's organic and no junk is added to the mix.

review/summary: OMG, so good!  Creamy mint!
review/text: Have you ever gone to an Olive Garden chain restaurant and been given a rectangular chocolate mint with your bill?  These are those mints!  At first, I though OG was handing out Andes Creme de Menthe mints, and I bought the Creme de Menthe at the grocery store only to be disappointed by a sharper mint taste (peppermint even, maybe?).  Ew.  Note to self:  You can't find Andes Mint Parfait candies at the grocery store.  They are online only, it seems.<br /><br />To describe the Andes candies in Mint Parfait flavor, they're a smoother, creamier taste of mint chocolate.  The texture is also smooth and creamy, go figure!  Very very good.  When my brother turned 30, I lined the rim of the chocolate birthday cake with the Andes Mint Parfaits as a decoration, because he loves these!  It was a hit.

review/summary: Fabulous Lahvosh!
review/text: Valley Lahvosh makes the best cracker bread.  If you haven't tried it before, find a Middle Eastern store, or large grocery store or whole foods store, and ask for it. It can be hard to find in the store. It is quite expensive to buy it here, but I haven't found another place to ship it to me.  A better deal than this, but without the variety, is the "Victoria Sampler" here on Amazon.  Lahvosh as bread on the table with a little smear of butter is a special treat.  It is great with soft cheeses and wine.  I will definitely buy again.

The first item I got, I think the two bags, arrived pretty broken up (Amazon made it right, tho!), but these shipped beautifully. Nice variety, and THE BEST lahvosh you can buy commercially. Light, delicate, and yet tasty, we make super spreads using cream cheese (green olives, black olives and chives, or red caviar and minced onion) just for these wonderful crackers. Don't hesitate for a minute. These are fabulous!!

review/text: I can't speak for the quality of the specific items as shipped through Amazon, but I purchased the Andes Toffee Crunch locally at Christmastime and can say that they are incredibly tasty.  After I tried one, I went back to the store the next day to get more and they were sold out of ALL the Andes candy -- probably close to 100 boxes gone, within 18 hours!  Apparently I'm not the only one who found them irresistible!  As with all the Andes candies, they're individually wrapped, which helps keep the entire box from being eaten in a flash.  They're perfect for a bite sized indulgence!

review/text: My 8 pound puppy gets a greenie every day.  She's a pretty picky eater, and usually takes forever to finish a meal (there are lots of breaks in between bites).  But her greenie is the only thing she will eat without stopping.  She loves the taste.  They also seem to be easy to eat - soft and chewy - so if your dog has sensitive teeth, this might be a good treat to consider.<br /><br />On top of that, greenies are supposed to help with your dog's dental health, which is great for me, because brushing my dog's teeth is really difficult.

I consider them a special treat and my dog really enjoys them.  They cost $8.99 or more in the pet store, so $6.73 is a deal!

review/summary: I'm impressed
review/text: I admit it, I've been a bad momma and my 3 year old Yorkie's dental health could be better. After a recommendation from a friend, I went out and got a few of the individually packaged ones just to make sure because my pup is a bit of a snot about what she eats. Much to my surprise, she ran off with her Greenie and hid under the chair so the other dogs couldn't steal it from her! It wasn't until weeks later that I observed the ingredients list. Shock of all shocks, my little carnivore is totally into these and there isn't a HINT of any sort of meat in them. Other treats have been snubbed, biscuits go uneaten and the money we spent on treats is invariably NOT worth it. Greenies changed that completely!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the steep price. I'm grateful to have such a little dog because I get more bang for my buck, but they're worth it. And it's probably much wiser to buy them here in bulk for a dog who's getting them daily. The vet also says these are pretty high in calories, but as our dog is 3 pounds and doesn't eat much anyway, I think these suit her well.

review/text: This is my first review ever.....i had to write one......why? because GREENIES are THE best!!<br /><br />I have a 4 year old Shih Tzu, and like any other dog, he loves dog treats.  The problem is a lot of treats are bad for dogs, and they make him have diahrrea or he throws up.  Well Greenies don't do that to him!  I've given him at least 10 in the past 2 weeks, i give him basically one every other day as a special treat for being a good boy.  He's a good boy a lot! haha<br /><br />Anyway, when i pull out the bag of Greenies, he hears it, he sees it, and goes BONKERS when i open the bag because his keen nose can pick up the scent of what is about to be a delicious treat!<br /><br />If you aren't sure about what treat to buy your dog, look no further, this is THE treat to buy!

review/text: These cookies were a seasonal offering at a local store.  I purchased one box.  After trying them at home, I returned to the store and purchased the remaining inventory! A simple scoop of vanilla ice cream is transformed by the inclusion of a butter crisp. I also love them with tea...or straight out of the box.  Don't be daunted by purchasing a pack of 12 boxes.  The cost is a little over half of what I paid in the store.  Lastly, unless you hide them in a dark corner of your pantry, you'll never have to worry about the shelf life, because they will be consumed quickly by family, friends, and yourself!

My Mother is 82, she has always baked cookies for our family, she praised them highly as well.<br /><br />For those into making Gift Baskets, these would be a nice addition.<br /><br />The price on Amazon was less than in the local Grocery Store. The Free Shipping, was also great.

review/text: over the course of one day while at my work desk. As other reviewers noted, they are light, buttery and delicious! I'm using the second box for homemade (sorta') ice crem sandwiches. They are so tasty they really are fine plain. Now I wished I had ordered several cases when they were on sale for $12, but maybe then I'd eat too many.

review/text: Wonderful, light cookie.  Very buttery; they taste like browned butter and almonds.  I am thrilled to find these at Amazon.  They cost a lot more locally and are very fragile, so bringing them from France always leaves me with a box of very delicious crumbs. These came well-packed and (mostly) whole, so they are suitable for company. 12 boxes may seem like a lot, but they go very fast. Highly recommended.

review/text: Wow very good.  Light and crispy with a great cinnamon and ginger taste.  I'm not a fan of ginger snaps actually, but these have a much lighter and not nearly as spicy taste. Remind me a bit of a graham cracker.  You can also eat a bunch as one serving, which is always a plus.  I also wondered when I opened the box how I would ever eat that amount of cookies, but now I'm pretty sure it's not going to be enough.  They did arrive broken somewhat even though Amazon put in extra packaging air bags. Doesn't change the taste, so I don't care.

Buying a case at a time from Amazon was great also.  They arrived promptly, in great shape and we didn't have to pay any shipping as we qualified for FREE SHIPPING on our purchase.  Having these in the pantry is a great timesaver.<br /><br />They've got quite a bite to them -- possible ginger.  They are thin -- just perfect for a quick nibble or dunk.<br /><br />We just loved them!!!

review/summary: So Simple, So Fantastic
review/text: Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Greatest Cookies EVER
review/text: They are crisp, buttery yet light.<br /><br />Unlike some other cookies, they even taste great when they are broken into smaller pieces (as shipping by Belgium is liable to do sometimes).<br /><br />The only downside is they are addicting - there are about 24 wafers per box and before you know, it's time to order another 12-pack :-)<br /><br />Yes, it seems like a lot but if you need to remove temptation - these make great gifts. As you can see, the boxes are classy and in most gourmet stores, EACH box can sell for nearly $6! ... so you will also seem a genuine benefactor :-)<br /><br />The only thing wrong with these cookies is that Amazon makes it too easy to obtain :-)

review/text: i have loved this product for years, and when I saw them on sale at Amazon, I jumped and placed an order.  It si very rare for Amazon to mess something up, but they did this time.  Their shipping method reduced the cookies to shards and crumbs.  You could never serve them in that condition.  But they make a fantastic crust.<br /><br />Lets face it, on this one item, Amazon completely dropped the ball on shipping.

But he nevertheless liked the thins more than expected.<br />His buddies liked them too and I doubt any package is left.<br /><br />Not everyone likes this specific taste (spekuloos is made with cinnamon)<br /><br />Personally I love Jules Destrooper tiny waffles best.  All is excellent tho.<br />highest quality.  Delacre is also excellent.  Lotus is less good. too much sugar.<br /><br />A favourite brand that develops taste without making you feel saturated with fat.

Although it isn't an issue to me because my family and I just eat them plain; it may be for some who serve it with a parfait and want excellent presentation or something like that. But that was just my experience. Will be purchasing more most likely when we run out.

review/summary: Elegant cookies of excellent quality
review/text: All of the Jules Destrooper cookies are made in Belgium with good quality ingredients and packaged well.  They are quite attractive and whenever I serve them to someone who has never had them before, they always comment on them.<br /><br />The thins are especially elegant, thin and crisp, wonderful with ice cream or a warm beverage.  My only complaint about Jules Destrooper cookies is that it is very difficult not to eat a whole box at once.  Whenever I see them at the dollar store, I stock up and try to hide a few boxes in the top cabinet.<br /><br />Ginger Thins - These have plenty of nice chewy little bits of translucent candied ginger (5%) that contrast with the almost brittle cookie and have a good balance of spice (ginger and a hint of cinnamon) to sweet.  These are wonderful with tea.<br /><br />Almond Thins - Crispy with lots of almond slivers and slices (10%) and a pronounced flavor of both brown sugar and butter.  I appreciate that they aren't loaded up with almond extract, making the taste more delicate in than the usual almond cookie.  Especially good with ice cream, cr&egrave;me br�l&eacute;e, or any custard-based dessert.<br /><br />Butter Crisps - These are also nice and crunchy but with a more neutral flavor, very buttery, similar to an ice cream cone.  They are excellent with a thin smear of jam and hot chocolate or with ice cream.<br /><br />Paris Butter Waffles - These are not quite as brittle or elegant as the others but because of the deep waffle pattern, they are the perfect vehicle for hazelnut chocolate spread (Nutella) or speculoos spread (Biscoff spread) and a cup of coffee.  This variety does have artificial vanilla, which is actually preferred by many for baking cookies.

review/summary: My new found favorite.
review/text: These cookies are delicious. I first tasted them when a box came in a Mother's Day gift basket.  When the last crumb had vanished, I searched for more on Amazon and, sure enough, my favorite shopping spot came through.  This crunchy, buttery waffle cookie is a terrific addition to a bowl of Blue Bell (yes, I'm a loyal Texan) ice cream or a good cup of tea or coffee. We even eat them with a cup of yogurt or kefir as a light evening meal.  You'll find your own favorite situations for this tasty treat.  The only thing I would change is the packaging.  Each thin box holds only 8 cookies, although each cookie is about 1 1/2 x 3 inches, so one cookie is plenty to eat in most cases.  Also on the positive side, the small packaging ensures that the crispiness lasts after the box is opened. I should add, the cookies are in two plastic nests of four cookies inside a foil package inside the cardboard box, so a good clamp keeps the opened cookies crisp and whole. Bon apetit!

review/summary: Awesome and addicting
review/text: Wonderful flavor and crunch. I especially enjoy them with my tea. The ingredients are natural, and since I don't remember seeing the ingredient list with the product information I'll give it here: wheat flour, brown sugar, butter, almonds(10%), salt, leavening:sodium bicarbonate. I use to buy these at my grocery, but only if they were on sale. Amazon's price beats the sale price, so Amazon is a very good bargain. Knowing how thin the cookie is I was concerned about the shipping breaking the cookies, but frankly the product shipped from Amazon was in better condition than the grocery version. These truly are wonderful, but beware that once you've opened a box it's very hard to stop at a single serving (8 cookies). There are about 30 cookies per box, and I confess, I've eaten an entire box in a day. If you like the flavor combination of brown sugar, butter, and almonds then you will really like these cookies.

review/summary: The Swedish Chef Would Be Proud!
review/text: Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of all things swedish, from Lingonberries to salt cod to Lutefisk to those yummy red candy fish. When I saw that Jules Destrooper had invented yet another Swedish delectable, I could not wait for my package to arrive!<br /><br />After assaulting the UPS driver and absconding with my "butter waffles" (which are more like cookies), I went into my kitchen and sat down in my breakfast nook to eat them. A hearty glass of milk was all I needed to drench the entire box and consume it. In reality, I ended up saturating the cardboard box and must have eaten that as well, because when I was done there was nothing left save for some soggy nuggets stuck to my ceiling. I assume they are from my delicious waffles and not from my earlier experiment of stuffing a cornish game hen with popping corn to "make its own stuffing." I am still picking bits of hen from my bushy, inappropriately dark eyebrows.<br /><br />Also, some recipe ideas for these waffles include topping them with olives, tuna salad, anchovy and pretzel (an old Slavic favorite) and peanut butter. Sometimes I give these to the neighbor children when they behave themselves, and actually I have only given one out to one neighbor child. My neighbor's kids are usually misbehaving and absolutely do not deserve any of my tasty cookies! Anyway, it turns out the one kid I gave it to was actually a lawn jockey statue, which makes sense because my neighbors, the "Davenports," have very light skin. They are actually quite pasty and I am waiting for the day when one of them develops melanoma, because they are always out in the sun, in their pool, having a "heck of a time," under the sun's deadly rays, oblivious to the cellular damage they are inflicting on themselves. I prefer to stay inside during the daytime and nighttime hours, usually venturing from my house every fortnight to collect my mail. However, when I know a delivery of Jules Destrooper Butter waffles are arriving, I am on "high alert" and spring from my rascal mobility scooter whenever I hear a car door close.<br /><br />Overall, I LOVE these waffles. Buy them, and If you don't love them too, send them off to me!!!

review/summary: An excellent food
review/text: I have been feeding Blue Buffalo foods to my Golden Retriever, who is almost 3 years old, since I brought him home as a 7 week old puppy. As a veterinary technician, I am aware of many common health problems in the breed, allergies being one of them. Knowing that corn and other fillers can be the cause of allergies, I wanted a food that only used the best ingredients. I looked into many different brands that were reported to use quality ingredients. Blue Buffalo, it turned out, was the only such brand that was readily available in my area.<br /><br />The breeder had been feeding Eukanuba Puppy food, so I started "Bruce" on a mixture of the Eukanuba Puppy and the Blue Buffalo Puppy. He would actually pick out the Eukanuba and only eat the B.B. kibbles (one of my coworkers reports that her Dachshund puppy did the same when she switched him to B.B.). So, I ultimately gave up on trying to mix the foods and just fed straight B.B. He would, sometimes, pick out those "Lifesource Bits" and leave them scattered all over the floor but is now a voracious eater and is not picky at all.<br /><br />As he is now an adult, I have been feeding him a variety of the B.B. flavors. I started him with the B.B. Large Breed formula, then switched to the Fish and Sweet Potato, then the Lamb and so on. I am hoping that by rotating the formulas, I will be able to prevent or, at least, cut down on any food allergies and provide him with a healthy variety of nutrients. Since he quickly scarfs down any food I put down for him, I can't see that he has any preference to flavor. He loves them all.<br /><br />I can report that, to date, "Bruce" has been an extremely healthy dog. His coat is thick and shiny, his eyes are clear, and he is a very solid 95 Lbs. Everyone that sees him oohs and aahs over how handsome he is. I know a lot of that is genetics but I'm sure Blue Buffalo had a little something to do with it, as well.

review/summary: My dogs are incredibly spoiled.
review/text: I am lucky to be able to purchase premium food for my two dogs, and I always choose Blue Buffalo. I have a Great Dane and a Sophie (we have no idea what she is) and both love the sweet potato and fish blend the best. Sophie has some digestive issues on other low end food, and this has cleared all of those issues up. My great dane doesn't eat as much with this food as she did with a lower end food, it is very filling for her. I did have a one time issue with a bag arriving split open and half empty, and Amazon's amazing customer service came through for me. They immediately replaced the bag at no charge and shipped it next day for me, no questions asked. The price for this food is high, but I feel that my dog's are a lot healthier because of the higher quality food. The price is great (and cheaper than my local pet mega-mart), I just wish that Amazon would offer a subscribe and save!

review/text: Our Springer Spaniels (1.8 years) have proven to be FOOD SNOBS! As puppies, they ate purina puppy food, but they refused to move on and eat the adult food! We have tried several brands of Blue Buffalo, and it is a superb kibble! Overall, lamb is the best because the salmon food smells fishy (surprise!), and they prefer it over the chicken by just a little. We have noticed that they have put on healthy solid weight, their coats look *fantastic* and they eat much less because of the quality ingredients of Blue Buffalo. It is well worth your money! Happy doggiez = Happy dog mommiez (and daddiez)!

review/summary: I like the food, sadly, my dog doesn't :(
review/text: I read a lot about this food prior to making my purchase. My dog recently suffered from life-threatening bloat...amazingly she survived :) To reduce the chances of future bloat I am now feeding her 4-5 times a day instead of only once. After researching, I found that a food high in protein and low in carbs/corn type grains was healthier and possibly less likely to cause bloat (there is very little known as to the causes of bloat so most information is just theoretical...no definitive findings). Well, I was happy to find that Blue Buffalo foods seemed to be tailored to exactly what I was in search of! In addition, my dog suffers from allergies and I had been supplementing her with Alaskan Salmon Oil for added Omega-3 and Omega-6. After reading about the Blue Buffalo Fish & Sweet Potato food I saw that it offered the additional Omega's and that if she was to eat it I would no longer need to do the separate supplement. Everything sounded wonderful! I placed my order and it arrived promptly. I tried getting her to eat the food for about a week or two before I decided it was a no go :( I tried mixing it with hot water for gravy...still, she never did take to it. She is typically a very accepting dog when new foods are introduced...however, with this food she was not. I wasn't bothered by the smell as were some other reviewers, but I'm not surprised by that since I had become accustomed to the salmon oil smell already. All in all, I do wish she had taken to the Blue Buffalo brand foods as I really like the approach they take with the ingredients and preparation methods. I tried her on the Lamb flavor too but she refused that as well. Although my experience with Blue Buffalo brand turned out to be one that wouldn't work, I would still recommend giving it a try for your pampered pup. It is a great food! Great ingredients! And made in the U.S.A. which is a definite plus! If you have the same problem that I did, the company offers a 30-day money guarantee through whatever retailer you buy from...IT'S WORTH A TRY FOR SURE!!! If you visit their website and fill in a short form they will snail-mail you a $5.00 off any size bag coupon :)

But, mostly I like the lack of corn and other lower nutrient ingredients.<br /><br />My only complaint about BB is the down-sizing of the 35lb bag to a 30lb bag a few years back---and then eventually raising the price.  35lb's got me through a 2week payday cycle, now I run out just before that.<br /><br />I highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: Wish I had tried it sooner!
review/text: We have a 9 1/2 year old English Bulldog with bad skin allergies. He was diagnosed at 1 year old and the vet put him on a prescription fish and sweet potato food to rule out a food allergy. It wasn't a food allergy so I went back to his regular food because of the price difference. We've had him on allergy shots ever since which successfully controlled them until we moved from NY to MN 2 years ago. The poor dog has gone through hell ever since. We even had him retested for "MN" allergens and he's been on the shots for a year with no improvement. As a last resort I reverted to our old vet's advice and put him on this to check for a food allergy. We were told symptoms would clear up within 2 weeks if it were a food allergy.<br /><br />Unfortunately it didn't clear up his skin, however his digestive health has been the best it's ever been. His old food made him really gassy and he burped a lot and while he was regular, he only went once a day. He's been on this new food for over 2 months and not only is he hardly gassy at all (the occasional burp), but he poops twice a day and they're healthy poops...not too soft or hard. Even though it's more expensive and didn't solve the skin issues, we'll keep him on a BB food for the rest of his life because we like that it's so healthy for him and he's got to be feeling better since he's not so bloated!<br /><br />We are, however, currently in the process of switching him over to the senior chicken and rice formula. I know senior dogs have different dietary needs than adult dogs so I want to make sure he's getting the right amount of stuff he needs and not too much of things he shouldn't be getting a lot of at his age and activity level.<br /><br />If the BB Lamb and Rice performs just as well as the fish and sweet potato then we're set.

review/summary: Doberman loves it
review/text: First off, if you compare the price of this by weight to regular food that is loaded with corn and rice, don't.  My dogs eat about 1/2 as much of this food because there is actual nutrition in this and not a bunch of filler.  I slowly cycled this food into their old food, because it's quite a change and if you don't your dog could be making awful messes.  Imagine not eating red meat for a month and then slamming a big ol' steak.<br /><br />I went with the fish and potato because my doberman has some skin issues.  The dry skin cleared up after a while.  For some reason none of the dogs will eat the black bits in the food.  There aren't a lot of them, but I think it's odd.<br /><br />The only thing I really don't like about this food is the smell.  If you don't close the bag up tight it can smell very fishy around it, and your dogs breath will smell a little fishy after they eat it.  Other than that the pooches seem happy.

review/text: I stopped using this product and switched to a less expensive alternative, after 2 recalls from the other food manufacturer I am back to using Blue Buffalo which seems to do pretty good with food manufacturing and avoiding contamination. I guess you get what you pay for, cheaper options seem to lack current good manufacturing practices to ensure a high quality product. I work with an organization that deals with cGMP for manufacturing processes every day, so I'm not bad at recognizing a serious manufacturer following cGMP. I'm paying a little more but I care about my dogs so I don't mind.

review/text: I have 3 large dogs- a Blue Heeler named Buddy, a Black and Tan Coonhound named Rocky and a very large and very hungry Pit Bull named Hutch. Luckily, none of my dogs have any food allergies, so I'm just looking for a good quality food that they all will eat.<br /><br />My Pit bull loves this food, but he's not picky at all and he will eat about any dry dog food out there. My other two dogs are a little pickier. Rocky ate a few bites of this pretty good but he refused to eat it the second time I fed it, Buddy who is my pickiest eater won't touch this dog food at all.<br /><br />The ingredients of this Blue dog food are excellent and I wish that all my dogs would eat it. Buddy seems to prefer Purina Dog Chow, Eukanuba Naturally Wild Turkey and the Science Diet Active Longevity dry food the best of any.<br /><br />So, even though, I know this is good quality dog food I won't repurchase (at least this flavor) I want to find a flavor that all 3 of my dogs will eat.<br /><br />NOTE: I noticed the main ingredient in this is White fish... I've never had a cat who'd actually liked any food with White fish in it maybe my dogs are the same. That probably accounts for the strong smell of this dog food.

review/summary: Blue is a very special dog or cat food
review/text: When I first got my dogs (one is a black lab and the other is a black mouth cur) about two years ago, I did a lot of research on dog food and found only a few brands I would consider. I am very happy with both the quality ingredients in Blue and that I can also buy it in cat food for my two cats. My cats (which were strays) were diagnosed two years ago with Feline Immune Virus (cat equivalent of HIV), but have stayed healthy with no symptons. I attribute this, in part, to their diet. The dogs' coats are shiny and they have lots of energy. Both my dogs and cats love Blue. In fact, one of my cats, even when his Blue cat food is sitting right there, will sometimes try to eat the dog food. This says a lot about Blue's ingredients because very few cats will choose to eat dry dog food.<br /><br />Mostly, I buy the chicken and rice but I switch flavors sometimes. My animals like all the flavors and I have not noticed any strong odors--just normal food odors--that others have mentioned. I am also fortunate that my pets don't refuse to eat the black kibbles. Dry pet food containing meat has to be processed at high heat for safety, but heat destroys enzymes and many nutrients. The black kibbles are the ones that contain Omega 3 oils for a healthy heart and other special nutrients. Blue makes them with a special cold process so as not to destroy the probiotics. If the animals don't eat the black kibbles it is like they are not eating their vitamins. The black kibbles are what sets Blue apart from any other dry dog food that I am aware of--even the ones with similar high quality ingredients.

review/text: My dogs love this food and my dog's dandruff has disappeared after a few weeks. I love this food but unfortunately because of the price i can't ccontinue to use it. I am going to try a different brand. The food has a strong fish smell which is to be expected.

review/text: You can find these here with free shipping and it will save you a trip to the bumper car parking lot of the mall.<br /><br />This is higher quality dog food. I know you may not care, but most brands they sell in the supermarket are really bad for your dog shaving off years of their life.<br /><br />I buy the weight control formula for Becky the Beagle and she has lost enough wieght to actually run! And she did so without starving if that's even possible for a Beagle.<br /><br />Worth every penny if you can get the free shipping. I have a $500.00 deductable on my car and hate going to the mall bumper car parking lots.

review/summary: Good food but smells terrible!
review/text: I have been feeding my Goldendoodle this type of food for a few months and his skin conditions have been improving. I decided to give this food a try because of the high content of fatty acids which are good for skin, but the smell from the dog is just too much. I first started feeding him outside, then leaving him out a few minutes after eating, but now, it is just too much, he doesn't even have to be panting or having his mouth open to smell that awful scent. He does poop 2 or 3 times a day and they are medium size stools.<br />I like the brand, but I think I'll try lamb or chicken now and supplement him with vitamins.

review/summary: Not this time.....
review/text: My 50 Lb goldendoodle had been eating Blue Buffalo for a year, but this time her stomach did not agree with it. She had loose stool for a week after I gave her this bag of food since we ran out of last one. And then she kept having pretty bad stomach. I finally decided to cook her food myself--rice with chicken or beef with vegetable. She loved it!! And her stool was normal. A week later I tried to switch to the Blue Baffalo again, no way! Bad stomach again. So I threw away the Blue Baffalo dry dog food and decided to move on to different brand name. I assumed this time the dry food was rancid or got contaminated because my dog had same food before and she was ok.

review/summary: made with pear juice....
review/text: not a bad drink - but why call it lychee juice when the ingredients are pear juice and lychee puree (in that order)?
