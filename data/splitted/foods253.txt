review/summary: It really works!
review/text: I bought this tea because I had a really bad cold (runny nose, sneezing, watery eyes, scratchy throat, body aches) and I read that Echinacea does wonders for the immune system.  I drank three cups of this tea the day that I bought it; it has a sweet flavor and is delicious (and this is coming from a very picky tea-lover!) I woke up the next day completely cured!  Coincidence? I think not!

review/summary: UGH  Yogi Teas taste awful
review/text: I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high :-) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible.  If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package.  Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!

review/summary: Easy, small portions - but taste is underwhelming
review/text: Jimmy Dean Country Gravy / B000H153W2<br /><br />I bought this gravy mix because I do prefer to buy bulk online and my `usual' brand wasn't available on Amazon, but I have mixed feelings about the results.<br /><br />For what it's worth, there's no sausage flecks in the actual mix, so that picture on the front is just a serving suggestion. The taste is... okay. Nothing to really write home about, and often I feel like it is just too salty for my tastes. The texture also starts to feel rather gummy after you remove the pan from the heat. I do like that this packet makes a small serving - one cup of mix instead of the usual 2-3 cups that a lot of packets have, which invariably gets wasted at our table. There's also no roux/dissolving step - you just toss the water/milk in a pan, mix the packet in, and you're done - and I've had no clumping issues that aren't immediately solved with a little whisking. It's certainly VERY convenient, but I do think the taste suffers a little as a result.<br /><br />I think when these are gone, I'm going to keep trying other brands.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/summary: Its supposed to burn your throat!
review/text: I read many reviews of this drink, and the same people said the same thing...that the drink burns their throats.  That is exactly the intention of the company, to "imitate" the affects of actual Cocaine.  To cause a throat-burning sensation while it gives you an intense, euphoric energy high with no crash.  Its quite a gimmick, I admit and I searched relentlessly to find a can just based on that.  Well, was I impressed when I tried it?<br /><br />To date, I have ordered 4 24 packs of this from the site.  I just ordered a 24 pack 2 days ago, so what does that tell you?  I have found a few loose cans in flea markets and instantly jumped on them.  So how would I describe the product personally?  Apart from the throat burning sensation which indeed takes some getting used to.  The flavor is unique, unlike any energy drink on the market today.  It has a slight cherry taste, mixed in with hot cinnamon and a hint of bubble gum sweetness.  The cinnamon flavor is dominant and most recognizable out of all the flavors.  If you can drink this down without pausing, you have a powerful throat because I still can't do it.  Just make sure you drink this served chilled, because drinking it warm would be kind of gross.<br /><br />Now for the energy buzz.  What a buzz it is, too.  I have drank hundreds of energy drinks and I usually don't go a day without an energy drink.  I have a high tolerance.  5 hour energy does nothing for me, I fell asleep twice after taking them.  Redline Xtreme barely does anything at all.  The first Cocaine I ever drank, I was seriously buzzed.  My body was shaking and I had a numb, tingly sensation, but it felt amazing.  I didn't have a ridiculous jittery energy high, but a focused high where I felt I could focus on video games for the rest of the night or write a long essay.  I didn't get the bouncy knee, it was mostly all mental energy, which is what an energy drink should supply you with.  I am definitely sticking with this drink as my energy drink of choice.  Whenever I have insomnia and have to wake up early to go somewhere, I drink one.  When I have a long day of walking, whether it be out shopping, to a mall, or flea market... I bring one with me and slam it down.  It is the perfect "get out and do stuff" drink and perfect for your hardcore gamer, such as myself.<br /><br />So stop the whining about a burning throat sensation, realize that is the intention of the company and order yours today.

review/summary: Cocaine is overrated and gimmicky.
review/text: First thing's first: The taste. It tastes sort of like generic cough syrup, minus the medicine-like taste (if that makes sense). It doesn't taste like any other energy drink I've ever had before. So it's unique in that regard. It's not necessarily a good thing, though. I would have to say that as far as taste goes, I would not recommend it.<br /><br />Secondly, the "spicy, burn your throat" gimmick. It's just that, a gimmick. It doesn't taste spicy so much as it just makes your throat itch. I assume that the slight "spicy" feeling comes from the drink being cold, but if drank warm I'd assume it would taste like camel urine. All it really did was kind of annoy me, it didn't really add to the experience. Not that I was looking for the real cocaine experience. *wink wink*<br /><br />Thirdly, while it has a high amount of caffeine, it didn't give me quite the kick I was expecting. It woke me up a little, but it didn't do much else. But then again, I drink energy drinks like water so I have a high tolerance. Though I would not recommend it to others, if you value your health.<br /><br />My girlfriend said that the caffeine effected her more than it did me. She got more of an energy boost without the jittery feeling you may get with supplements such as 5-Hour Energy. She said that she enjoyed the flavor of the drink, so you have a second opinion there. She said that she had experienced the taste combination of cinnamon and strawberry. She enjoyed the "spicy"-ness of it but agrees that it wasn't as strong as expected. Even though she liked it, she would only be interested in buying this again if more cans were added or the price was lowered.<br /><br />Now, here's where I would have to suggest not buying this product. Whether I liked it or not. It is TOO. *BLEEP*ING. EXPENSIVE. About $30 (including shipping) for six 8.4 fl oz (250ml) cans. You're better off buying something like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004NCTXZY">Power Horse BIG 16 Energy Drink, 16-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a>. It costs about the same, maybe a couple bucks more, and you get 24 16 fl oz cans. And in my opinion, it gives you more of a boost, tastes better, and you get more for your money. It's a cheap alternative to the more well-known energy drinks (i.e. Red Bull, Rockstar, Monster, etc.).<br /><br />All in all, mediocre experience, mediocre drink, too costly. NOT. WORTH. IT. Save your money. Don't fall for the hype like we did.

review/summary: A Treat My Dog Loves
review/text: Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much.

review/summary: Three out of Three Dogs plus one Cat love these
review/text: I have been buying these chicken jerky treats every month via Amazon's subscription for the past six months and the bags aren't enough for the three dogs and one cat who love these treats.  All I have to do is shake one of these bags and all four come running into the kitchen.  Even the well-behaved old girl walks in hoping for her treat.<br /><br />These are the only treats I feed my dogs.  They don't get junk dog biscuits or fake sausages that smell like turpentine.  All they get are these treats, two a day per dog.  When I take them out hiking, they get extra treats for extra energy.<br /><br />The cat always insist on his own slivver, too.<br /><br />These treats are easy to pack, don't spoil easily, don't smell and are a lightweight and healthy treat for any four-legged pet. Sure, the treats are a bit pricy but my pets are worth it.<br /><br />UPDATE 24 Feb 2012:  My subscription over the past year kept going up, from a very reasonable USD 19 to a shocking USD 28.  That last price hike was just too much so I cancelled my S&S and am now buying a competitor's product that is much more affordable.  I took a star away because this product is now longer affordable.

review/summary: GREAT results with continued use at the prescribed dosage!
review/text: My 10 year-old black pug has problems with her back left hip and knee. Sometimes, the leg goes out on her and she ends up on her butt, unable to get moving again. I started feeding these Happy Hips treats to her a few months ago, but did not realize that I was not feeding as many as prescribed which is 1 jerky treat for each 7.5 pounds of body weight. She did show some relief at the lower level. However, after realizing my error and increasing the dosage to the recommended level, she now shows FANTASTIC results. After 3 weeks, she chases her squirrels, she and her cat brother play chase, and she hops right over puddles. She has not had her back leg go out on her this entire past month. She's a real dog again! Just know that you must be patient - it took 3 weeks of daily use at the recommended level to see the full results. This product has worked so well, I now have it on auto-order.

review/text: I have been using this product, as well as the duck breast, for well over a year. There is no comparison to Tail Waggers from [...]. This product is the only one that my 3 dogs will eat without hesitation. They have put their noses up to all other treats, except this brand.

review/summary: Price is right and my dog loves them
review/text: My Jack Russell has problems with patella luxation. I decided against surgery after researching the success rate of it and 5 years after it was diagnosed she is still OK. I keep her weight down and give her plenty of long walks to stengthen her ligaments. The vet told me she would probably have problems with arthritis so I give her one of these chicken strips daily and also give her liquid glucosamine choindroitin on a small piece of bread. My dog loves the chicken strips, the price on Amazon is better than me buying the indivdual packs from the store and having the glucosamine in it is another way for me to administer glucosamine to her in a way that is tasty.

review/summary: Outstanding dog treats (Not)
review/text: My dog loves them.  I purchased them way cheaper at Amazon than at the market.<br />Theoretically, they have an adequate amount of glucosamine and chondroitin.<br />My dog won't eat the pill (even in a ball of peanut butter).<br /><br />  MJG<br /><br /> Follow-up to my review of Dogswell Happy Hips. Since my original review, I have checked this product at Consumer Lab. According to their lab results this product has only 6% of the glucosamine and 14% of the condroitin that it claims. Don't buy it expecting to help your dog with joint problems<br /><br />  MJG

review/text: This product is great.  First off, the dogs love it, they get it the same time in the morning, and they go crazy when I take out the bag.  One of my dogs has very bad allergies, he can only eat certain foods, specifically lamb and rice, and not chemical fillers. The Happy Hips fit the bill, they are quite wholesome.  My dogs are getting a bit up in years also, and it is good for them to get a dose of glucosamine and condroitin.

review/summary: Duck is very good for dogs that are prone to skin conditions
review/text: We have three dogs. One (Shaunty) is a Bishon Frise. Shaunty has had a tendency of developing "hot spots", a dermatitis type problem. Our vet recommended we switch to a duck and potato dog food, which we did. All three dogs love the  duck and potato dog food so the switch was easy...although the dog food is expensive. Anyway, when I saw these duck jerky treats I had to try them. We've been buying them monthly on Amazon's subscribe and save program and all our dogs look forward to their daily treat. You can buy this product with confidence.

review/summary: Caused diarrhea in one dog, vomiting in the other
review/text: I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product.

review/text: My great dane has two torn acls and has arthritis in her hips... and she is ONLY three. Well we have done one surgery and will be doing the second next spring when she is healed. In the mean time I needed to find some DIFFERENT way to provide her with Glucosamine. Since she is so picky I needed something in a treat form. These are her FAVORITE thing to eat! I went to Petco and was going to buy ONE bag for $35 and realized this offer was for THREE bags at the same price. I could not be happier and neither can she. She has only been eating them for three weeks and is not even limping on her surgical knee (its been 8 weeks and it takes 12 weeks to fully heal). Even our vet is surprised she is doing this well and the only change was these treats! I recommend them to anyone who needs to help their pet enjoy their life to the fullest! BUY these! You wont regret it!!!!<br /><br />PS - I also bought the duck and she loves those too :)

It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere.

review/text: I hope this may help others whose dogs love this treat like my fussy Lhasa Apso but she's nearly 16 yrs. old and I found she suddenly developed an insatiable thirst; which then caused so many frequent late night forays to go outside to relieve herself we lost hours of sleep. Thinking it was her age we let it go for awhile then I decided to take her off the varied brands of dehydrated chicken breast (all without additives) and within a week she no longer empied bowls of water and had to go out all night long. It may react on her differently because of her age but for others who may experience this problem you may need to take your dog off this type of treat...I'm now using the Purina Chicken Carvers (I know chemicals) but she no longer is having problems..go figure... I guess dogs are all different too huh?

review/text: my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase.

review/text: My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine/chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it- she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!

review/summary: Great made in China product for dogs.
review/text: I've noticed that quite a few people don't seem to believe the labels of products made in China, when it is usually a U.S. company that dictates what goes into the product.  Besides read the labels of products made right here--a vast majority of them contain toxic to humans & animals ingredients--everything from paint & varnish to the food is tainted with these toxic chemicals & all made right here in the U.S.A.  So, if you can trust a U.S. label--why not trust a Chinese label?  These treats are sure a hit with our dogs--all 7 of them love the chicken, lamb & rice, & the duck with glucosamine & chrondroitin.  We buy this type because of our older dogs with severe arthritis.  Our 15 yr. old was almost beyond walking until we started feeding him these snacks & our 9 yr. old Chihuahua's hip problems are much improved. On S&S these snacks are the cheapest price that we have found & with free shipping--Keep 'em coming Dogswell & Amazon--yes, even from the dreaded China.

review/text: My little Schipperke could hardly walk in the morning because her hips hurt so much.  Even though she is only two, we worried that she would need surgery to get around.  We started her on Happy Hips and in less than two weeks, she was a pup again... running around and enjoying life.  And, she runs to the kitchen in the morning to beg for her "treat" because she loves the taste.  What a great product.  Thank you so much.

No matter how fussy your dog, or how limited his or her dietary restrictions, these treats not only drive them wild, but have added goodies to improve their health. Ya' can't go wrong! I also would try the other varieties (heart health, breathies, vitality) each has a lil' something to address your dog's specific needs, and above all, they will love 'em.

review/text: I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......

review/summary: Good deal on a great item!
review/text: Well first, my dog loves these.  I made the mistake of giving one to him at night before bed, and now he flat out demands these before bed or he pouts all night. Why?  Well, it's basically a healthy chicken jerky.  The ingredients are good, and so is the quality!  I am very sensitive as to what is in pet foods I buy, and this is a great treat!<br /><br />And I do have a comment about the person who mentioned that they are made in China. My response is so what?  I actually think it is a good thing!  We treat chickens (as mean as they are) so poorly here, and their waste pollutes our rivers and streams.  Land is a whole lot cheaper and easier to come by in China, and they don't tend to pack them as densely as they do here.  So thanks to China we have a great product with a much cheaper price point then we would normally have to pay for.  We are one world people, and if another country can make a quality product with a lighter impact on the environment then we can, I am happy to share whatever the profits are with them.  Sure they made many mistakes industrializing, and I am sure they will make more... just as we will.  However, they are very sensitive to maintaining quality at a good price point, and I have more faith in chicken coming from China then I do from the US... sad to say but true.<br /><br />So back to the review.  While the quality and look of the product is great looking, the smell indicates that the flavors are probably stronger then just regular chicken (think of beef jerky).  If your dog has a very sensitive tummy I would buy a small pack first and make certain that it digests easily.  As for my dog, a Golden Retriever, he would likely gobble the whole bag if he could, and not think twice about doing it again the next day.

review/summary: My dogs are loving these, thinly sliced so easy to chew
review/text: I don't think everything from China is crappy, though I do think it pays to be vigilant EVERYWHERE these days.  But cage free in the US and in China doesn't mean happy chickens either place - it just means they're in a barn (usually without light) - check out Food, Inc. and many other documentaries.  If it were natural for my dogs, I'd have them go vegan too, but right now I do what I can with the humans in our family and try to pick what seems to be the least harmful to all other sentient creatures sharing this planet.<br />So that being said, this product compares to other chicken jerky products for dogs out there just fine and to boot does not have hormones.  Also, the individual slices are thinner than many other brands which helps the dogs chew these properly (fewer larger chunks swallowed).  The price is great to boot - I highly recommend these and will be buying more (at least until there is some healthy vegan jerky for dogs that I can afford!)

review/summary: BEWARE:  MADE IN CHINA
review/text: I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so "addictive." My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is "decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods." So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.

He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite "except" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still "Made in China" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again.

review/text: These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients.
