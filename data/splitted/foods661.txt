review/summary: Good dog chews for small dogs
review/text: These are good quality chew sticks but way too small for our Dobie puppy.  He would soften them up and then swallow them whole.  I would only recommend for very small dogs.  But they are clean and don't dirty the carpet.  I still think they smell bad even though they are "low odor", but they are a quality chew and my dog loves them.

review/summary: Does a body good!
review/text: Wow this one whisks up really nicely! Granted I am getting better at whisking and making a nice froth on top of my matcha but this one was easy peasy! I have noticed some matcha flavors mix more easily than others for some reason and since I do make more than one matcha many days its not just due to me being better one day versus another. This one whisked up to a very full forth quite easily! I note this because I know froth is really something many of us struggle with especially when we are new to matcha so I wanted to make a note of it for those of you who may feel deflated by not getting a good foam. Get this one and you can feel stellar! lol<br /><br />Now as for taste, I am not one who has had a lot of passion fruit in their life, other than in smoothies I have got from smoothie places and those are usually so riddled with sugars and other fruits picking out the passion fruit itself was a little difficult especially not having passion fruit in and of itself.<br /><br />Now I get to taste real passion fruit! Yay!<br /><br />It has a bit of this natural rind like flavor similar to that you sometimes get in a mango or papaya. Fruits I do have personal experience with. I like it though - it really compliments the natural grassy like flavor of the matcha base! And contrary to the smoothies I have had its not that sweet. There is a tart flavor to it but not bitter. It tastes REALLY healthy, and while matcha is always healthy sometimes I feel guilty having my dessert like matcha lol although I shouldn't such as my favorite butterscotch mathca makes me feel like I'm cheating haha this one makes me feel like I am really doing something good for my body and trust me my body needs all the help it can get!<br /><br />The aroma of this one is really quite nice! It is very eye opening and even if its only a mental thing I sure can use that in the mornings!<br /><br />There is the after taste of the rind like flavor but the passion fruit flavor makes my mouth water for more, literally, as if the juices itself are pulling out the watery mouth sensation! Its strange but nice. Its like having a mouth full of juicy passion fruit!<br /><br />So I drank half of my matcha straight, then added some sparkling italian water and some sweet cream non dairy creamer to make an italian soda and OMG goodness! The flavors ERUPT into a juicy fruit gum sensation which is similar in some ways to the brandy matcha I am going to review next! It is different though as the brandy also has alcohol notes to it whereas this one does not. This is like the virgin variable you give your kids while you have the brandy one haha. Except this has that lovely awakening rind flavor in the background that lingers in the after taste.

review/summary: Fruity, light, refreshing
review/text: I've had "passionfruit" flavored teas that tasted nothing like passionfruit. Red Leaf's passionfruit matcha is not one of them. This delicious tropical fruit flavor definitely shines alongside the base matcha. I prefer this matcha cold, though I plan to try it hot come winter. It'll be perfect for summer daydreaming, because there's something about the flavor of passionfruit that screams summer. It's well captured in this matcha. The flavor isn't heavy, but I do find that just the slightest touch of milk/cream really rounds out the cup. Another hit from Red Leaf!

review/summary: I wouldn't call them "cookies". Also, the label language is obscure.
review/text: These don't have an appropriate texture to be called "cookies". The ingredients aren't blended well, so it feels more like a granola bar to me, and I've always hated granola bars (even when I was unaware of their harmful effects on human health). They also smell artificially, which interferes with the perception of their taste... although I can't tell if they have any taste, besides some sweetness. Where did orange, ginger, and chocolate go?<br /><br />It's also irritating that the manufacturer doesn't talk about the ingredients in a simple and straightforward manner. Why say "low glycemic monosaccharide" and "low glycemic fruit concentrate"? Admit that it is FRUCTOSE. It is not enough to say "vegetable fiber". They are supposed to know exactly WHAT KIND of fiber they use, because it makes a difference.

review/summary: Really Lovely Taste. My fave low-carb cookie, and it's GLUTEN FREE and doesn't make for tummy rumbles.
review/text: These taste GREAT. These don't have gluten. These are lower carb. These have no sugar. JACKPOT!<br /><br />I searched quite a while to find a treat/snack/dessert that I could enjoy on my diet and my once-sugar-addict hubby could enjoy so he doesn't feel deprived. I do carb controlled "Primarian" type dieting (mostly protein and veggies, with some cheese/yogurt, fruit and nuts/nut butters, no sugar (rarely, anyway), no gluten. I've given up most grains and have lost 110 lbs. Hubby is nearly underweight eating this way, so he gets extra snacks/treats.) So, I really had a hard time finding certain convenient (ie, I don't have to make it!) dessert items. These cookies solved my dilemma.<br /><br />I like the Orange Ginger Chocolate best, followed by the Island Lime. I found the peanut butter ones had a weird oily flavor. My super picky hubby likes the Cinni-Apple Spice. We've reordered these multiple times in the last few months, usually 4 or 6  bags at a time of EACH the three flavors. It gets really expensive, but it consolidates shipping. At 2 to 3 cookies at a time as a post-dinner or post-lunch dessert, it keeps me sane. Seriously, while I love fruit for dessert, sometimes, I just want me something that TASTES like I'm having pure old-fashioned junk. :D<br /><br />The texture is the only thing that could be improved on my fave two flavors. (I find the Cinni-Apple spice fine, but blander than I prefer, hence my preference for the others.) Some batches are nicely crispy. Others are chewy and stuck-together. I think they don't handle transport in the summer heat too well or the moisture levels in summer, cause my order earlier in the year were much nicer (ie, during the cooler/drier months). But even with the chewier texture and less crispness the flavor shines.<br /><br />Island Lime is mis-named. They should just call it Coconut Citrus. It's mostly coconut. It tasted 90% coconut to me with a hint of the citrus. Suits me fine. I adore coconut cookies (ie, the old sugary ones I used to get). So, if you expect heavy lime, sorry. If you love coconut, go for it. I judge most items I buy by the first five ingredients. Sure, the others count, but those are the BULK of what makes a lot of items, so here goes for Island Lime: Almonds, whey protein concentrate, unsweetened coconut, egg whites, vegetable fiber.  Very low-carb friendly stuff. It's 79 calories per serving of 2 cookies, 4 grams of fiber, 1 sugar, and 2 grams of protein.<br /><br />My fave, the Orange Ginger Chocolate taste like a bit of chocolate met a bit of Cointreau and had a baby. It's not a heavy choco taste. It's not really all that gingery. Just a bit. And the citrus reminds me of my earlier years when I sipped Cointreau at parties. Same texture issues, but the taste is a treat to me with coffee. Really satisfies. The nutritional profile didn't please me as much as the Island Lime, but hey, you sometimes just need that treat. First Five: Almonds, Whey protein concentrate, egg whites, vegetable fiber, maltodextrin.  It's 74 calories for 2 cookies (an acceptable amount on my 1200 to 1400 calorie diet), and it has 3 grams of fiber,  1 sugar, and 3 grams of protein per serving.<br /><br />I don't get intestinal distress like I do with some low-carb/diet stuff with sugar substitutes, which is another bonus. And the fiber content pleases me, too.<br /><br />If you miss having cookie on your diet and need to avoid gluten, here ya go. Enjoy.<br /><br />I would note that Netrition has a better price on these and reasonable shipping. Wish Amazon would stock and sell these. I order these a lot and it would save me loads to get it on my Prime list of items. Oh, well. Worth trying, no matter the vendor.

review/text: I lost faith in my long time cat food, Science Diet, after the massive pet food recall.  Fromm claims this dry food is made in the US (Wisconsin) from meat, cheese and vegetables bought from local growers.  Quality meats, no glutens, fresh vegetables and human quality vitamins.  The cats like it.  It is more expensive than Science Diet, but not prohibitively so.  Note:  the Milwaukee newspaper advises the canned Fromm is made in China.  I have absolutely no faith in the Chinese quality and safety control standards so I would not buy the canned foods.

review/text: Admittedly, I had a fever.<br /><br />And I must say I am a devotee of the Corn Flake (though I only eat Trader Joe's Brand--Kellogg's flakes, though tasty, have too much crap in them).<br /><br />But Cereal City--the true target of this review--and a place that now has GREAT bearing on my thoughts about this product--was CREEPY.<br /><br />From the bald lady with two teeth who took our ticket and felt that this gave her liscense to engage us in a too-long conversation, to the Pennywise-looking clown that reeked of smoke--our first two minutes set the tone.<br /><br />Throw in a weird new-agey film with floating balls of light that became speaking versions of dead historic figures who never got along in life and pick up their arguments right where they left off on the screen.<br /><br />Add to that a poorly-lit animatronic Snap, Crackle, and Pop who end up either looking like they are rising from the grave or falling in worship at the feet of Tony the Tiger (depending on whether they are coming up or going back down).<br /><br />Our (hopefully) unique experience involved not being able to find a lady crucial to our scavanger hunt for 45 minutes (did she go in back and take a nap?) I want a shirt that says "I waited 45 minutes to complete the Cereal City scavanger hunt and all I got was this crappy sippy cup."<br /><br />Sadly there is much, much more...I could go on at length. But I won't.<br /><br />The main point is that I get the sense that Kellogg's, as a company, is just as creepy as its tourist trap. Avoid both.

review/summary: Good flavor, not hot!
review/text: I'm on a low budget, a lot of it consisting of canned foods like campbells chunky firehouse hot and spicy chili. Like the other reviews available mentioned, it is NOT spicy by any real standards. For anyone who's been to a curry house chain restaurant, and ordered "hot" and not extra/super hot, you'll realize the definition of hot is rapidly changing to fit the more moderate group of individuals. If I'm really trying to save money that week, I just have a can a day. Half a can with rice, for lunch, and half a can with rice for dinner. I prefer to have it with long grain rice since its generally a bit dryer and goes better with the liquidy nature of the chili. I eat it with cheetos flaming hot chips, not the healthiest diet by any means, but it is a VERY cheap meal, and tastes great with the combination of things. What I like most about the chili is its high fiber content, I'm not one for eating a lot of vegetables, so the fiber in this really helps.

review/summary: Best chili ever!!!
review/text: I LOVE hot chili.  In my opinion chili should be HOT,  otherwise all you've got is bean soup with hamburger in it.  This chili is all that and more.  I decided to try it without adding my usual hot stuff to everything I eat.  I was pleasently suprised to find my eyes sweating and having to stop to blow my nose.<br /><br />  BUY THIS BY THE CASE!!!

review/summary: Better than Homemade
review/text: My husband believes that this particular chili soup is better than his home made chili, which he will never make again as long as he can keep a supply of the Firehouse Hot & Spicy Chili on hand.  It is full of flavor,beef and beans and we have used it as a topping for baked potatoes. It is spicy, so if you don't like food that's spicy, don't buy this soup.  I have no idea how the other chili Campbell soups taste.  However, this is a winner.

Luckily, my barista and my local stand told me it was the mix and not necessarily the barista.  She told me they used Big Train Chai.  She was right.  I can now make my own chai's at home using Big Train Chai that are as good as what I get from the latte' stands and have cut my morning chai addiction costs considerably.

review/text: My doctor recommended I use this formula as a supplement for my son. My son was not a premie but at 6lbs 2oz he wasn't breaking the scale either so the extra calories in this formula are perfect for him. Also for some reason he has no trouble going back and forth from breast milk to the Neosure formula, my daughter struggled quite a bit when I introduced formula in her diet, it wasn't the Neosure. Bottom line is I have been very happy, and so has my little boy.

review/summary: Customer Service
review/text: LaCosta Gourmet's customer service is incredibly wonderful.  Tonight, I ordered only one pound of coffee that needed to be delivered in two days.  I tried to order it with upgraded shipping but, after I got Amazon's confirmation, it showed standard shipping and could take 8 days, given the intervening federal holiday and weekend.  Seeing that, I emailed La Costa Gourmet to see if the shipping could be upgraded to 2-day.  Within five minutes--I kid you not, 5 minutes!!!, Jeff at La Costa Gourmet called me, assuring that the order was due to go out first thing in the morning and is expected to arrive in two days, no need for an additional shipping fee.  I know that the order for one pound of coffee seems like a small matter but, it is for a family member heading overseas.  This small matter was very important to me and obviously very important to La Costa Gourmet.  They have earned my undying loyalty for customer service, great communication, & not ripping me off for an additional shipping fee.

review/text: These Haribo sour cherries are vibrantly colored and look like a red cherry on a green stem with a green leaf attached.  Each piece is over an inch long.  They are very cute!<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are sugary sweet and not sour to me at all.  They taste just like those cherry flavored cough drops that come in the red and white box and have no medicinal purposes whatsoever!<br /><br />If you like the flavor of artificial cherries, these are good.  They smell good too.  If you are looking for candies for a kids birthday party, these will definitely be a hit!  If you need a sugary pick-me-up, grab a few and you're set.  But if you really want something more sour, try another kind of Haribo candy.<br /><br />Added thought:  these would be beautiful cake decorations!

Even worse was that every single one of them in this 5 pound bag were BROKEN. none of them were in one piece, the stem connected to the cherry. i used them for Valentine favors, and they were NOT cute like the raspberries, because they were in parts. the non-saur part was the Big let down. they may have come broken because they were shipped in the Dead of winter. tho they did not sit outside for one second. so not sure if they always come broken. i will NOT be getting these again.

Eating a whole<br /><br />sour cherry is too much at once!<br /><br />YUM!

review/summary: These are the ones you want.
review/text: Once, years ago whilst working in a faraway land I sat down to eat with a co-worker who had upon his plate a heaping helping of fish bodies swimming in a tomato sauce.  "What, pray tell, are those" I queried?  "Sardines," he said, to which I replied "No."  We settled the dispute by fishing out the can from the garbage and ascertaining that it did indeed state 'Sardines' on the label.  I was flabbergasted, having had no idea that a sardine can be as large as a plate as th0se were, or as small as a pinkie finger as many of these King Oscar Tiny Tots are....but let's face it:  Nobody wants to eat a humongous sardine.  In fact, doing so is antithetical to the meaning of the small fish, it's oxymoronic, and downright distasteful to do so, possibly even disrespectful.<br /><br />In the years since then whenever I got the craving for sardines I would buy a can of them, usually in mustard sauce, then catch myself thinking that I remembered sardines being tiny fish packed, well, like sardines in a can, and the ones I was buying seemed relatively large....generally as large as the can was wide and meaty such that they would quite overwhelm the saltine cracker I placed them on, and they tasted like fish.  I'm not complaining, I'm from a state that was famous for its sardines and the ones I was eating were often caught and processed there....I just thought that Sardines were, by their nature, tiny.<br /><br />It turns out that the name Sardine is a term similar to Beer.  In other words, lots of different kinds of fish get to be called Sardines but to me and likely to most people, classic sardines are meant to be small and Brisling: The kind of fish that can be stacked two high in a can as small as a sardine can. There is another fish called the Sild harvested in Scotland that is just as or nearly as small which I suppose makes it too a classic sardine, but most of the others that we eat over here in the US are slightly larger with more dark flesh and a fishier taste.  Them are good, but these are better!!!<br /><br />In fact, these are great.  They are great because they are tiny (most are 3" in length), of delicate white meat (with a section of dark) and a wonderfully neutral sardine flavor that pairs well with a dash of Tabasco and a Saltine.<br /><br />Even better than their flavor is the visual impact of their sleek, fat, glistening, silver-sided bodies packed end to end in their palm-sized, aluminum, pull-top can which neatly evokes the turn-key steel sardine cans of my childhood.  It's a picture almost too pure to sully with a fork or knife, luckily that ephemeral beauty remains up until the last body is pulled from the can and laid out upon its cracker and finally consumed with respectful appreciation.  Heaven.

review/text: I adore sardines and have tried them all... at Trader Joe's (the worst! so dry and flavorless!), at Whole Foods, at local gourmet shops, imported from all parts of the world. These are succulent with the perfect, rich flavor. Even my baby (less than 1 yr old) loves to eat these (I wish I could give her more but they have added salt). If you want the best, these are the best. Don't even bother with the other King Oscar sardines.

review/summary: Lightly smokey, not too salty - perfect for a sandwich
review/text: These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.  At any given time, I've got a dozen or so (one case) stashed away, and I rotate them along with my other necessities.

I had to find a high in nutrition dog food that was not full of fillers and corn meal etc.  This is the food your looking for.  It probably is the best on the market and my dog deserves only the best.  We humans wouldn't eat something that we didn't like and we are smart enough to know what is good for our bodies.  So we treat our pets the same.  We use to feed our pets Science Diet but have decided to upgrade to be a better dog food that he likes to eat.  I think it has much better flavor so my dog eats it.  Yes it is costs more but well worth the added 15 dollars per month cost.

review/text: The chocolate was as good as we expected.  Preferring darker nutrition dense and flavorfull foods, this met our expectations.  We will purchase other products from this company as we have need.

review/text: Shame on me for not knowing what I was buying by not being sure how much the ounces were, but shame on the person for selling the bag of chips for that much money. I will never purchase anything from amazon again.

review/summary: Dynasty Mustard Powder
review/text: A couple of months agoe I was looking for Dynasty Mustard Powder and had no luck locally, so I searched Amazon and found it. I was thrilled and ordered (the minimum order of 12) online. I gave away several bottles to neighbor's never noticing the expiration date. Last week I used my first bottle for a dressing I like and it tasted very bland but didn' know why. I tried remaking it a day agoe and again, bland. I decided to check all the dates on the ingrediantes and found the exp. date on the mustard is July 15,2011. I noticed on my last old bottle I had, it was 3 years to expiration (but there is only a teaspoon left). I was so upset that they would send me an item (12 bottles) that would be out of date in two months!
