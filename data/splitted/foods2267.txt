review/summary: This works at many levels and it lasts
review/text: I have annoying and frequently recurring dandruff. It only appears when I dress up.)I've never used a prescription resloution. I've tried Head and Shoulders, Tegrin and Selsen Blue. They all work great for two weeks and then the dandruff comes back and the product doesn't clear it.<br /><br />This product has kept me dandruff free for 6 weeks now and is a pleasure to use. The tea tree oil in it has a delightful effect I did not anticipate. I have recurring skin rashes, probably fungal, that I treated as necessary with tea tree oil. Since I have been using CLEAR the rash is resolved and my skin as well as scalp feels wonderful.

review/summary: good anti-dandruff shampoo
review/text: This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.<br />I've heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out. My son said he didn't really notice a difference between the shampoo  and the combined shampoo and conditioner that he tried.

review/summary: Nice smelling, and soothing
review/text: I enjoyed using this 2 in 1. I normally like my shampoo and conditioner separate, but since I have short hair now, I don't really mind using a 2 in 1.  The shampoo comes out white and it lathers and foams nicely.  It reminds me of Head and Shoulders.  It also has the same active ingredient.  It does not have a powerful smell, but does make me smell clean.  I always get a bit of flakes here and there, even when I use dandruff shampoo daily.  I also use hair gel, so that could contribute to it.  I will continue to use Clear products, and would recommend you try it as well.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I can't say I'm very impressed with this product. First of all, something is wrong with the lid, which prevents it from closing all the way. The bottle arrived in a plastic bag and about 20% of the bottle's content spilled into the plastic bag on the way. The bottle ended up looking messy and being slippery to the touch. I had to wash it before using it and it was dripping all over the place. My husband has almost finished the bottle by now but we still haven't found a way to get it to close all the way.<br /><br />The shampoo and conditioner are not bad but they do nothing to eliminate dandruff. It's a little annoying to see the words "anti-dandruff" on a product which doesn't even remotely begin to do anything to fight dandruff. I fail to see anything special about this product and I don't think we will be buying it in the future. There isn't anything hugely wrong with it (except the faulty cap) but there isn't anything good about it either.

review/text: This shampoo does what it is suppose to, I did have a reduction in dandruff.  The shampoo itself has a heavy scent to it while you are applying it, but does not remain long after rinsing.  The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.

review/summary: Leaves my hair very soft and prevents itchy scalp and flakes
review/text: I am very selective about what type of shampoo that I use because many do not agree with my hair and scalp. If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. A lot of the time shampoo will make my hair feel very oily as well.<br /><br />I typically use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. I have been using Pantene Anti-Dandruff shampoo recently and it has been my recent favorite. However I think that I like this shampoo slightly better. It has a nice scent and lathers very well. It's also a thinner consistency than most shampoo.<br /><br />There are two things about this shampoo that make it really good. First of all it has twice the Pyrithione Zinc as many Anti-Dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it very soft and manageable.

review/summary: Not bad, but nothing to write home about
review/text: First, a setup about me. I'm a male in his mid-20s, with hair that tends to the dry side and varies between 3/4" and 2" between haircuts.  Besides a comb, shampoo, and conditioner, I don't use any other hair care products.<br /><br />Having had good results with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR8UC">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, 12.7 Fluid Ounce</a> I started using in May, I decided to give this a go. While this product did what it set out to do, it's nothing extraordinary.<br /><br />On the plus side, I like the nice, thick lather this works up, and it does a pretty good job cleaning up even filthy hair (after a day of yardwork and woodworking in 95-degree heat, one wash got 95% of the gunk out and a second got the rest). I was not so impressed with the almost-waterlike viscosity of the shampoo/conditioner (if you hold your hand at a 30-degree angle the gel - I use the term loosely - will pour out of your hand). While the conditioning was decent for me, my standards are pretty low, and I ended up using the above-mentioned conditioner a few times after this product so my hair doesn't dry out.<br /><br />All in all, for less than seven bucks, this does a decent job, even if it's not the best option out there.

review/summary: Enjoyed by all the guys in the house
review/text: This 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner has a great fresh scent and washes hair well, leaving it soft, but not greasy feeling. It lathers up well and washes out cleanly. A very guy friendly scent, not feminine. This shampoo is most loved by my pre-teen son, who prior to this had been using a more kid like version of a 2-in-1 shampoo. He likes this Clear Men Scalp Therapy quite a bit better, and has claimed the remainder of the bottle as his. The only issue I have with it is this brands bottles of shampoo and conditioner don't always ship well. After receiving 4 bottles of Clear Scalp shampoo/conditioner, 2 our of the 4 bottles had leaked just a tiny bit during transport. They are packaged in plastic bags to help in case leaking, but when it came to my orders, 50% of them were leaking in some way upon arrival.

Well the Clear Men Scalp Therapy works just as well and it smells nice too.......much better than Head and Shoulders.<br /><br />I am going to switch to this shampoo/conditioner from now on.  I just flat out like it.  I am still an old guy, but my hair looks and feels better.

review/summary: Clear Men is a better alternative to H&S - great smell and feel on the scalp - no need for separate conditioner either
review/text: I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCUTKI">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KN8UA">Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OYFJQ">Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> watched in fear.<br /><br />All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised "bio nutrium 10", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.<br /><br />The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  This formulation advertises it is "Dry Scalp Hydration".  It does not have a strong cooling/burning feel like the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>, and does not smell as strong as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a>.  It has a light aroma of tea-tree oil and mint and is a great every-day shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff.  There was no real lasting smell or feel to it.  I didn't need a separate conditioner because this particular shampoo is a 2-in-1.  As I rinsed it out, my hair brushed and controlled easily without the need for conditioner as well.<br /><br />I like the Clear Men's line and would say that this particular one is one of my favorites.  To be frank, I tried all 3 of the 2-in-1 shampoos and had a real problem telling any difference between them.  They are all recommended, or get whichever one is the cheapest at the time.

review/summary: Very Good Shampoo
review/text: I have constant mild dandruff and this shampoo kept it at bay as efficiently as Head and Shoulders, which is the brand I normally use. This lathers up nicely, requiring a small amount for a lot of hair. In other words, the first couple times I used this product, I got more than I needed because I'm used to the set amount of H and S that I need. This is nice because this makes the bottle last longer. The smell is not overly powerful and my hair felt clean for over 24 hours. I would purchase this item for continual dandruff control and I like how it cleans my hair as well. Recommended.

review/text: I use Head and Shoulders b/c I have moderate dandruff.  This 2-in-1 works just as well against the dandruff.  It is thicker than Head and Shoulders, so I only had to use a small amount (about the size of a dime-I have a short haircut).  It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after. Overall, I think I am going to switch from Head and Shoulders!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/text: This Clear "Men Scalp Therapy" is good at stopping dandruff and does leave our hair looking and feeling clean, but it also has a fairly strong odor that tends to linger. We are long time "Head and Shoulder" users and have been pleased with how well it works on dandruff, but it does not provide the body this shampoo and conditioner combo does.<br /><br />My hair is buzz cut short and my son's is over shoulder length long but we both tend to run to oilier side. I didn't notice too much of a difference in the effectiveness or look of my hair but my son's hair has become truly impressive with increased body (my wife says he looks a bit like a Viking now). The only down side is that we don't like the smell very much.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Good shampoo....
review/text: My husband has been using this shampoo, since it is marketed toward men.  He has a mild case of dandruff, and normally uses Head & Shoulders shampoo.  This product has the same active ingredient, which is pyrithione zinc.  But it also has several other additives, including ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins B5 & E, sunflower, soybean, almond & coconut oils.<br /><br />After using it for a few days, he stated that he likes it better than the Head & Shoulders shampoo he was previously using because his scalp is less itchy.  I noticed that his hair feels softer than it was before, and it has a pleasant scent.<br /><br />His only minor complaint is the shape of the bottle.  It has a narrow base, and it slightly wider on the top.  It is not very stable, and is easy to knock over while taking a shower.

review/summary: Keeps the flakes out and leaves hair looking great
review/text: This is a nice shampoo if you have  mild to moderate dandruff. I have a dry, itchy scalp and some dandruff now and then, so this anti-dandruff product works great for me with occasional use.  Clear Men is not as strong as Coal Tar or prescription dandruff shampoos, but this stuff leaves my hair smelling great (unlike coal tar shampoo) and the conditioner leaves my hair feeling full bodied.  I really like the 2 in 1 shampoo products because I don't like wasting time using shampoos and conditioners separately.  The shampoo comes out from the top (so no leakage issues), but you can flip the bottle when you are almost out and want to get the last bit of shampoo out. Although a little more costly than run-of-the-mill brands, this is the nicest 2 in 1 anti-dandruff shampoo/conditioner I have tried.

review/summary: Better Than Head & Shoulders
review/text: I recently ordered both this and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">Cool Sport Mint</a> shampoo recently to compare them. Essentially they both work well and about the same. The Cool Sport Mint is the more "invigorating" of the two. When I leave it on my scalp for a couple of minutes, I can definitely feel a cooling tingle. This has a little tingle, but not so much. They both lather well. The scent is very mild. And does help control those pesky flakes. After a week of nightly applications, there wasn't a speck to be seen.<br /><br />As a 2 in 1, it does leave my hair softer than if I were to use a shampoo alone. However, I found the conditioning aspect to be a bit weak; so it can't hurt to use a separate conditioner or even a leave in after your shower/bath. For most men who don't want to bother though, it should work just fine. I like the shape of the bottle and click top cap -- it makes for easy handling with wet hands. CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo isn't the cheapest of the recent crop of anti-dandruff shampoos that have appeared on store shelves this year, but it is one of the more effective ones. I had been using the less expensive <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050N4HRE">Garnier Fructis</a> shampoos and while similar, they don't seem to work quite as well.<br /><br />~ Kort

Once in your hair it doesn't run all over the place - so I can lather up my hair finish other my shower duties, then rinse.  After a couple of uses I didn't notice any buildup; seems to rinse clean.

review/text: I had gotten this shampoo for my husband who has suffered from dandruff for years. He was in the Army and ever since he had to shave his head when he first entered, he's had terrible dandruff. Now that he's out of the Army and he has all his hair back, the dandruff is worse than ever so I finally decided to get this for him. After the first two times using it, you ccould tell a noticeable difference in the amount of dandruff he had. Now that he's been using it for about a week, he barely has any at all.

review/text: How do you describe the shampoo experience? Oh, you think "experience" is a little much?<br /><br />Well, OK, here are the facts as I see them:<br /><br />First, I don't have full-blown snowstorm dandruff. However, my scalp is often itchy and dandruff shampoos often make it better. Here is how Clear Men Scalp Therapy did for me.<br /><br />Smell: This has a definite anti-dandruff smell.  It is not unpleasant, but has a stronger bite to the nose than regular shampoo. (I don't know how else to describe the smell.) The smell is not overwhelming or attempting to provide all day cologne effect. It is not feminine, but not particularly masculine, either.<br /><br />Feel: There is plenty of lather and it feels pleasant. I am not sure about the "cool" feeling. No tingle, but plenty of nice lather. I like that I don't have to worry about a separate conditioner.<br /><br />Results:<br />Scalp: It is nice to wash with and my scalp feels less itchy for the day.<br />Hair: My hair feels clean, soft, full. I am impressed by how manageable it is, since manageability can be a problem for me. I have a full head of hair, but it is only about 1 1/2 inches long on the top and short on the sides and back.<br /><br />Cost: This costs a little more than some shampoos, but it is not in the price range of salon shampoos. At my local store, it was $5.99 today versus $3.99 and more for upscale dandruff shampoos (most without conditioner). I have tried some of the $3.99 brands and Clear Men works better. The bottle I received was 12 ounces and it seems like each shampoo takes a couple of teaspoons for a really great lather, so this bottle will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm not sure why there are several different varieties in this shampoo line, since this one works well for me. After I have used up this bottle, I will probably continue to buy this brand. I would definitely recommend trying it out.<br /><br />*4 stars because it works well, not fabulously (nothing works fabulously) and because I can't be sure that it would work this well for anyone else.

review/summary: Perfect for Me!
review/text: I'm so happy I received this 2 in 1 shampoo for dandruff control for my hair.  It smells great, lathers lavishly and contains the normal ingredients for dandruff control.  My hair smells and looks clean and my dandruff vanishes when I use this shampoo regularly.  I don't like to use separate shampoo and conditioner.  I find if I use a conditioner separately on my hair, then my thin and fine hair is weighed down with the moisturizing ingredients.  With Clear Men Scalp Therapy I can do my hair more quickly and get the exact amount of conditioning that I need as I shampoo.  The lather rinses off quickly and I can use this product every day if required.  As we are now (July 2012) having a heat wave, I am using this product every day and my hair looks good day after day.  I recommend for all men (and women as well).

review/text: I enjoy the fresh clean feeling of my hair and scalp after shampooing with the NEW! Clear Men Scalp Therapy, 2 in 1 Clean & Refresh, Anti-Dandruff, Daily Shampoo & Conditioner. I especially like the convenience of the combination of shampoo and conditioner, the anti-dandruff application, and the sense of scalp health after a vigorous scalp massage combined with the blend of the nutria, ginseng, and mint & tea tree ingredients of the men's scalp therapy product.<br /><br />I appreciate the assurance that frequent application of the product will insure that my scalp and hair are moisturized, manageable, and healthy.

review/summary: Not like most anti-dandruff shampoos
review/text: This is a really good product.  Has a nice smell and the consistence is good -- not too thick and not runny.  Periodically I have an issue with dry scalp and this really made a difference with that plus it left my hair shiny and feeling and looking very clean.  Sometimes anti-dandruff shampoos leave your hair dull looking but not this one.  I also think it helps with volume as my hair is thinning a bit so that was a nice benefit. I'll buy it in the future.

review/summary: Works For Me
review/text: Being an ex marine I never thought I would be reviewing shampoo and using words like smooth, silky and pleasant. But, I gotta tell it like it is. For the past few years I have been using Nizoral to control my dandruff. It no longer does the job either because my scalp has become immune to it or perhaps the ingredients have been changed. I decided to give Clear a shot and the results have been pleasantly surprising.<br /><br />My hair is short although not as short as it was in boot camp. A little dab of Clear covered my entire hair supply. The color is a milky white. Rubbing the Clear into the hair and scalp had a feeling of silky smoothness. The odor is pleasant although very faint. The initial treatment removed all the dandruff but left me with a small amount of itchiness. Subsequent treatments continue to provide cleanliness but they have also removed all symtoms of itch. For the first time in months I have enjoyed wearing a shirt without white flakes and not having to constantly scratch my head.<br /><br />It works for me and as long as it continues to do so I will be a custommer.

review/summary: It burns like clean
review/text: I had some pretty bad dandruff, but I wanted to put this thing through its paces. So, for one week, I didn't wash my hair with any shampoo at all. I'd let it get wet in the shower, but that's it. I wanted there to be enough of a build up of the itchy scalp and the flakes and the rest that I could tell if the shampoo is doing the job, versus any other extenuating circumstances. I used to use Head and Shoulders (H&S) to get the job done, so I have used dandruff shampoo before.<br /><br />There are a couple of things that Clear has over H&S.<br /><br />- The smell is very pleasant. H&S has a medicine-y smell, and people can tell when you've used it, because your hair positively reeks of the stuff. This one smelled pleasantly fruity in a way. It smelled like regular shampoo, so nobody has to know I had been using a treatment on my hairs.<br />- The lather is much thicker and sticks to your hair. H&S tends to be not quite as creamy and rich as Clear, meaning that it tends to drip off of your head as you use it. This stuff holds fast.<br /><br />Both H&S and Clear get rid of dandruff after the first use, even when the dandruff has built up. Both provide immediate relief from the itching.<br /><br />Cons that both H&S and Clear have:<br /><br />- My hair feels dry and light. This means that with my short hair, it looks like I have some kind of furry creature sitting atop my head. I need to use a separate conditioner to make my hair feel like it's going to behave itself, or put some kind of product in my hair to tame it.<br /><br />Cons that only Clear has:<br /><br />- A burning feeling if you leave the shampoo on your head too long. Mind you, my head was already feeling uncomfortable from my scratching it earlier that morning, because of the buildup. I just think that the tea tree oil in there was doing something to cause it. As soon as I rinsed off the shampoo, and dried my hair, the burning went away.

review/summary: Clean and Refresh
review/text: My husband has bad psoriasis on his scalp. Nothing made the flaking go away until this shampoo. He only has to wash his hair every other day and no more snow storm on his shirt. I am not a fan of all the ingredients. Sodium lauryl sulfate is bad. It has a lot of chemicals in it. We try to do no chemicals in anything. Since this works so well, he will continue to use it but less frequently. The nice thing about this is it is a shampoo/conditioner combo. It timgles the scalp for a refreshing wash.

review/text: I have to admit I hadn't tried this when it 1st came in the mail, but I believe they need to make a stronger cap for the bottle. Why? Because when it came in the mail, the cap was broken and shampoo was oozing all over the plastic bag which held the shampoo. Consequentially, when I 1st wrote this review, I only gave this one star.<br /><br />I finally opened the bag and tried it out. Fortunately, the shampoo is better than the container it came in. I haven't had as much trouble with my scalp itching. Yes, the shampoo is good but they still need to put it in a more sturdy container.

review/summary: Itchy and Flaky no more!
review/text: The hubby is always on the look out for something to control his itching and flaking, especially in the drier months. We recently tried Target's "t plus therapeutic shampoo" which worked well but had an odor that offended the great nose. I picked this shampoo up, hoping it would satisfy all the senses and here are the hubby's thoughts:<br /><br /> "This is a 2 in 1 anti-dandruff shampoo & conditioner with Bio Nutrium 10, a blend of 10 Nutrients and botanical actives including Ginseng, Tea Tree, and Natural Mint.  The active ingredient is Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%) for anti-dandruff.  It lathers very nicely, smells great, and a nice consistency.  Packaging is very attractive.  The question is how good is it for controlling dandruff and itching?  I used it for about a month regularly.  Previous to this I had been using Head & Shoulders anti-dandruff 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner with the same active ingredient.  For me Clean Man Scalp Therapy did a better job of controlling the dandruff & associated itching.  Maybe the Bio Nitrium 10 is the difference?  It left my hair manageable and smooth.  I found the price to be slightly higher in my area,  than H&S, but comparable.  So if Pyrithione Zinc works for your dandruff and itching, Clear Man Scalp Therapy is an excellent choice that you must try.<br /><br />5/5 Stars"<br /><br />So, it is a rave from the big guy and here is hoping the irritation and flakes are a thing of the past.

review/text: "CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, Clean & Refresh"  is a new alternative for those who use dandruff shampoos, and overall it's a good one. It has a nice, crisp feeling on the scalp, cool, but not overpoweringly so. It has kept my scalp flake-free as effectively as "Head & shoulders 2-in-1", which is my usual shampoo of choice, but actually feels more refreshing on the scalp. It washes clean with no residual, and left my hair looking shiny and soft. Overall, definitely worth a try for those who use shampoos such as "Head & Shoulders 2-in-1". Recommended.

review/text: And as a bonus, it smells good, too!<br /><br />As a regular user of Pert Plus anti-dandruff, I was happy to try this.  The Clear Men shampoo doesn't have the same smooth / pearly feel to it that Pert does.  Perhaps the balance is a little more towards shampoo and a little less towards conditioner?  I don't need much conditioner, so that's fine for me, but it is worth noting the difference.<br /><br />As for the anti-dandruff function, it seems to work fine.  I haven't noticed any difference in effect between this and Pert, though the active ingredients are different.

review/summary: Works Well, Smells Great
review/text: This may be made for men, but as a woman, I have found it to be very good.  Works as advertised, and smells wonderful.  I have several scalp problems that have really tried my patience over the years.  I have problems with dermatitis, dandruff, itching, flaking and crustiness.  I have used prescription products that really did a number on the managability of my hair, and smelled awful.  I have tried just about every over the counter shampoo, with various results.  None of them really helped with managing my mess of thick and coarse hair and treating my scalp problems at the same time.  Normally, I don't condition my hair, because that seemed to make the scalp problems even worse.  I did not hold out high hopes, but decided to try this out when it was offered to me through the vine program.  I am so glad I did!  From the first time I used it, I noticed a difference.  The tingling feeling was great, no burning for once.  My scalp and hair just felt clean, not tortured!  And I love the fragrance.  Normally, I am not a big lover of perfumed shampoos, but this one just smells clean and fresh.  If you have serious scalp problems, you may want to try this out.  I use it daily, and once a week I massage it into my scalp and hair while dry, and let it work on it's on for 15 minutes before I actually wet my hair and scalp.  I find it really has made a huge difference in the flaking and itching, and cut way down on the crustiness I tend to also get on my scalp.  The built in conditioner is a real plus, my hair is more managable but not weighted down or greasy look.  What a great product!

review/text: The Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner certainly seems to work well.  I normally do not use any conditioner, so with the conditioner built right into the shampoo, it's a good way to condition, and lays my hair down nicely.  I'm a guy, so I do not really care that much about shiny hair and all that, I just want to remove the dirt.  Normally I use Head and Shoulders, which seems to work well.  With the Clear Men Scalp Therapy, it smells fine, not too flowery, works up a good lather, and removes the dirt, so I say it works just fine.

review/text: I picked the Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, because I usually get a mild case of Dandruff once in a while, and my hair is dry and curly, so a shampoo with conditioner is always my first choice. In this case the herbs, Ginseng, Tea Tree & Mint, which are part of the ingredients of the CMST2in1AS, influenced my preference too. It's very concentrated; a little bit will do a nice lather and it does what it promises, it cleans hair and scalp leaving a cool refreshing feeling with easy to comb hair. And in my personal situation, without dryness. The smell is really nice too.<br /><br />This is a great shampoo to use especially during the summer when one might wash hair more than once a day, for example, during the morning and after going to the beach. In my case, I don't style my hair during the summer because of the heat and the humidity, so simply washing it and towel dry work out pretty well for me.

review/text: The new Clear product line of shampoos and conditioners is quickly becoming a favorite. I love the fresh and clean smell of the shampoos which smell nice, but not too "perfume-y". They also provide a great clean feel to my hair and scalp.<br /><br />I've used anti-dandruff shampoos before, and while they work, they always left my hair feeling a little "burnt" after repeated uses. I've used the Clear product every day this week, and it hasn't left my hair feeling dried out like Head & Shoulders does after repeated uses.<br /><br />Highly recommended, especially at this time of year when it's easy to cause lots of damage to you hair and scalp due to exposure to the sun, swimming and chlorine while swimming.

I tend to believe experts who say a product can't really be effective as both a shampoo and conditioner, so the claim here seems ambitious, but I often shampoo without conditioners so this claim wasn't really meaningful to me anyway.<br />While an occasional use is fine, I wouldn't consider making this my sole shampoo; in fairness, I think shampoos always must be interchanged to get the best results.  In short, the product was fine, but I'm not sure given the choice of shampoo products on the market I would buy this unless it were bargain-basement priced.

(I'd say it lathers up better than H&S)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- none so far<br /><br />Interesting:<br />- I will say that this shampoo feels and looks a bit like Elmer's(r) glue when you put a little in your hand; sort of fun!

review/text: This product was given to my brother to use. After a few days he said that for one he defiantly like the smell. He likes that it is two in one. He doesn't have danruff but have a few dead skin in the scalp areas and notice it was gone although not everything as it is a few days still. He will continue to use because he likes the way his hair feels after and should he have dandruff from the dead skin this may help the symptoms. But who knows lets see after a month or two.

review/summary: Not Just for Men!
review/text: I guess this shampoo is labeled as being for men because its scent is not especially feminine. That's silly, though. The scent is fresh and clean, and would be fine for a man or a woman. It's slightly minty -- nothing that screams "MAN."<br /><br />I got this shampoo for my husband, and it was great on his slightly-oily hair. It left his hair smelling and feeling nice, and seemed to control his dandruff just as well as his regular shampoo does.<br /><br />I tried the shampoo myself (on my normal-to-dry hair) and although it is a 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner, it wasn't conditioning enough for my hair. Great smell, though, and generous lather.<br /><br />I would recommend this product for anybody with normal-to-oily hair, regardless of gender.

Their 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff shampoo and conditioner isn't bad, yet it doesn't compare to other brands like Head & Shoulders.

review/summary: A keeper....
review/text: rating: 4.5 stars.<br /><br />I don't gush over men's products.  Most of the time they seem to do what they say they will--or not.  This is one that does.<br /><br />This is the second product I have tried from Clear and I have to say empatically that I like it.  Unlike most shampoos and conditioners that leave my hair feeling clean, but overly treated, this one doesn't.  I especially like the way it seems to rinse out and still leave my hair feeling clean.  It has a slight minty aroma and if anything, I would have liked it that other half star if it would have had more.<br /><br />My hair seems fuller and lies better immediately after using it, and even looks good the next day.  Many hair products with conditioner give my hair any oily look the next day, but this one doesn't.  I would consider this a true "men's" product and would recommend it without reservation.

review/summary: So far so good
review/text: I ordered this item thru the Amazon Vine program because I have a small on-going issue with dandruff.  Having only used it for the past three days I cannot say it will definitively take care of that problem, but I must say the combination of anti-dandruff and conditioner formulas seems to be quite effective so far.  A small amount lathers up quite well, the scent is minor and not intrusive and the shampoo rinses out easily and thoroughly.  And there is noticeably less dandruff on my shoulders.  Recommended.

review/summary: Clear Men Scalp Therapy
review/text: Clear Men Scalp Therapy seems to be a pretty good shampoo.  I really don't have dandruff but wanted to try the product anyway.  The shampoo smells good, lathers well, and easily rinses off.<br /><br />Since I take my showers at night, the real test comes in the morning.  After using the shampoo a couple of times, my hair has been manageable both times after shampooing.  I'm thankful that I have more hair than most guys my age and much younger.  The product appears to be okay.<br /><br />My main gripe is that when the product arrived, the bottle cap somehow was loosened during shipping and I had to clean the mess.  Probably about 60% of the product was still available.  Amazon needs to be more careful when shipping products such as these.<br /><br />Still, the shampoo seemed to be okay.

review/summary: Terrible packaging, but OK product.
review/text: Another reviewer remarked that the bottle was leaking when it arrived.  Same with mine.  And it's a bad package design.  I don't know what other guys do with their shower products, but I have a shelf in my shower that shampoo bottles and the rest go on, and this is entirely too tall and top-heavy of a bottle not to fall over in that environment.  I do appreciate the one-handed snap-open lid, but it needs to be on a much squatter bottle to prevent frequent falls.  I would guess it's too tall for most caddies and is not a good fit for gym bags, either.<br /><br />So having attacked the packaging, I found the scent to be pleasant and just this side of too much.  I expected an herbal smell, which can range from subtle and welcome to overpowering and obnoxious.  With mint and green tea essences fighting it out in the formula, the smell could have been awful.  But no, it's not that obtrusive and results in a sense of freshness rather than having been heavily perfumed.<br /><br />The conditioner works quite well.  Because my hair can become oily over the course of a day or two, I favor shampoos that are good at removing oils, but the unfortunate side-effect is that stripped hair can become damaged, fly-away, and lifeless.  The conditioner in Clear Men is light enough to avoid adding to my greasy head woes, but present enough to add a little body and manageability.<br /><br />I am highly doubtful that the herbs used--or indeed, any herbs--are as effective a treatment for dandruff as several non-organic compounds (notably those with sulfur and zinc compounds) are, but I do not have much of a dandruff problem to start with and generally only choose dandruff compounds as a preventative.  I don't know but suspect that men with really serious dandruff issues are not going to be satisfied with the treatment afforded by largely herbal therapies.  "Clear Men," however, does contain a zinc compound that I suspect does all the anti-dandruff heavy lifting, with the botanicals merely added for cache and marketing appeal.<br /><br />Having said that, and setting aside the horrible packaging, it's a perfectly acceptable shampoo and I can see myself getting it again sometime--more likely if they come up with a bottle that is less like a carrot and more like a pumpkin.

review/summary: I enjoyed the shampoo
review/text: The manufacturer of this shampoo states that men's scalps are different than females' and men require a male shampoo. They may be correct. CSI-type programs inform us that forensic experts can tell the difference between male and female hair. This "scalp therapy" is designed to be a shampoo and conditioner for men, as well as an anti-dandruff treatment. It is supposed to give users a "cooling affect" and leave "hair feeling ultra-fresh." I guess by hair they mean the scalp. The manufacturers put nutrients into the shampoo, including, among many others, ginseng, mint, vitamin B5 and E, and sunflower oils.<br /><br />I have been using Head and Shoulders for several decades and this shampoo worked for me, even though it is not designed for a specific sex. I didn't have dandruff after I started using it. Therefore, I can't testify whether this treatment stops dandruff. I did not notice a "cooling affect" or feel my scalp "feeling ultra fresh" with this new product. The only difference that I noticed was that the therapy cream felt creamier, oilier. My wife tells me that my hair smells fresh after using both shampoos.<br /><br />I noticed that others who received the shampoo through the amazon vine program, like me, also, like me, received a bottle that had leaked. I don't know why this happened. I cleaned up the bottle and kept it turned upside down to see if it continued to leak. It stopped leaking.<br /><br />In short, as far as I can tell, the two shampoos are substantially alike. I am unable to comment whether the new shampoo's many additional ingredients improved my hair or scalp in any way.

Easy to grip even with soapy hands.<br /><br />*He liked to way the spout worked with no separate screw on lid.  Easy to work with 1 hand.<br /><br />*He liked the smell.  It's not heavy like H&S and is far superior to Selsan Blue.<br /><br />*He LOVED that it rinsed out very easily.  With the H&S he was rinsing several times before he felt that it was all out.<br />  This product just 'disappeared'.<br /><br />*He liked that it made a good lather without using alot of shampoo.  He feels it will go further than his H&S.  Some<br />  products tell you to use a pea size portion but it's never enough.  With this product very little is needed.<br /><br />I will update my review in a couple of weeks when we have seen how it does on the dandruff.

review/text: This combination shampoo-conditioner does the shampoo part ok, but the built in conditioner does not leave your hair feeling nourished and smooth the way a stand-alone conditioner will. It pretty much leaves your hair feeling the same way after you shampoo but did not condition afterwards. For that reason I would not recommend this product.<br /><br />Another negative, this shampoo arrived leaking with liquid spilling out. The container does not look cracked but the seams on the lid which go around the entire bottle is a weak joint. For the poor product packaging alone I wouldn't recommend this.

review/summary: Great taste and convenient
review/text: In the past, I just didn't use tomato paste very often. That's because most brands are just nasty. We'd always have a can of Hunt's or Contadina around, but I'd always be disappointed whenever I used them. It's really annoying to, say, make homemade enchilada sauce, have it taste mediocre, and then add insult to injury by having to throw away half a can of leftover tomato paste.<br /><br />Amore, by contrast, actually keeps the bright tomato flavor. Since it's in tubes, there's none of the "tinny" taste so common to canned foods. And it's so easy to squeeze out a small amount that I use it all the time. There are all sorts of soups and sauces that can benefit from a little tomato flavor, but which don't justify opening a whole can of paste. (Not to mention the fact that most canned pastes would make the food taste worse, not better.)<br /><br />There are only two mysteries about this product for me. First, a 1 1/2 tablespoon serving has 2 grams of fat. No other tomato pastes I looked at contain fat. Since the ingredients are only tomato paste and salt, I have to wonder where this fat comes from. The second mystery is that they label the box as "double concentrated." As far as I can tell, it's no more concentrated than any other tomato paste: I still have to use exactly the same amount in a recipe, it just tastes better than the other brands.<br /><br />But I'll forgive Amore the mysterious fat and exaggerated labeling. This has become a cooking essential in my kitchen.

I was extremely pleased to find that it had a very fresh taste, without the slightly burnt and "tinny" taste of canned tomato paste. I would not pay the  around $4.00 price for a single tube, but it is an extremely good for the price when bought in bulk in Amazon's grocery store. It's great having it shipped to my desk at work, also - saves time that I'd rather spend on cooking and gas because it's not available at local stores.

review/summary: Amore tomatoe paste
review/text: There is a problem with the packaging of Amore tomatoe paste,  As a former packing machine operator I could tell that it was done at the factory as the tube is inserted in the shelf box ( the black box )  MY 12 tubes arrived on time, and the cardbox was undamaged.  The second layer of packaging the large black box looked fine also,  the problem was the individual box for each tube.  My wife discovered that some tubes had actually leaked, not because of bad sealing but because the machine that inserts them into to display box (individual carton for each tube) was jamming them in the container so hard it actually bent them.  EVERY TUBE IS DAMAGED, TWO HAD TO BE THROWN AWAY.  So I cant fault Amazon for the damage it wouldnt of been noticed by your order filler.<br /><br />the Amore paste is a wonderful product just needs better inspection proceedures to insure better customer satifaction,,,<br /><br />product rating 5  packaging 1

review/text: I bought this because of the dire reports about how unsafe canned tomato products are - something called BPA on the can interiors is leached into the tomatoes because of their high acidity.  After I saw that the tubes were metal  I emailed Amore to ask about BPA.  I give them much credit for repsonding but it turns out these tubes also have BPA so they are no safer than the cans.  I will say this tomato paste tastes better (but not WAY better) than what I get in cans but I don't think it's worth the extra cost.  I get three small cans for a buck at Dollar General and theirs has no added salt which to me makes the DG brand a smarter choice.  If the Amore was organic then I'd say it was worth the cost but it isn't.

There are regulations about the acceptable levels of mold in certain foods. The minute you open that can of tomato paste any mold that is in the can can grow with the exposure to oxygen. The longer it is in the fridge the more chance of mold growing. Most of the molds are benign and not likely to hurt you, but they will taint the flavor of the tomato paste.

review/text: I was introduced to tubed tomato paste a few years ago and have never looked back. Convenience was the huge selling point: no more opening a whole can to use only a little. Of the tubed paste I've tried, Amore's taste the best, so it was great to find it available through Amazon's "Subscribe and Save."<br /><br />If you're trying tubed paste for the first time, note that it is in general more concentrated than canned paste. Amore's label says it is "double concentrated." I can really tell the difference in dishes that use just a few tablespoons to provide subtle flavor, as in a good minestrone or stroganoff. At first, I suggest you try just a bit more than half the amount of tomato paste called for in your recipes.

I only need one tablespoon so I don't like opening a can and then having to freeze the leftovers. I also like the flavor of this tomato paste much better than canned. It says it is double concentrated but I just use the same amount called for in any recipe.

review/text: I have been using Amore tomato paste for 10 years. I ordered it from their distributer in Pittsburgh, PA before Amazon carried it. It is very convenient to use for recipes that call for a small amount of paste such as chicken or veal Marcela, beef Stroganoff etc. It is great mixed with horseradish and Dijon mustard on a roast beef sandwich. I have used their sun-dried paste but don't like it as much. I still use 8oz cans for spaghetti sauce. I store the bulk pack in a cool basement and the opened tube in the refrigerator and have not had a problem with spoilage. It tastes great - not bitter or acidy. It is expensive compared to 8oz cans but the lack of waste and superior taste make it worthwhile - so I highly recommend you try it.

review/summary: The Cadillac of Tomato Pastes
review/text: I have several favorite recipes that use tomato paste, but they many of them only use a couple of tablespoon.  With canned paste, I usually ended up throwing out the rest of the can after a week in the refrigerator made it taste like the can.  I first used Amore paste when I lived in Europe and I loved it.  It has a rich tomato flavor, no metal taste from the can and it keeps for weeks in the refrigerator.  It's more expensive than the small cans, but considering that I don't throw any away, it's cheaper in the long run.

review/summary: Crazy about this tomato paste!
review/text: I see from my Amazon records that I purchased 12 of these tubes on Jan. 4 of 2010.  I'm ready to order again!  We thoroughly enjoyed the taste, the ease and the storage provided by the Amore Tomato Paste.  I used it in braised short ribs, spaghetti sauce, roast beef sandwich spread, vegetable soup - can't live without it now.

review/summary: Handy, tasty, waste free
review/text: I've always hated the eventual tossing out of partial cans of tomato paste - such a waste.  So I finally went with these - a few more than I really needed, and a bit more expensive than the canned varieties.  BUT, sooo much better tasting, way more convenient (keep one in the fridge), and no more wasting half a can or more every couple of weeks.<br /><br />It also gives me a use for an old toothpaste squeezer device I don't need since that now comes in a pump. :)

review/summary: Great way to use tomato paste
review/text: This is a great way to save on the use of tomato paste!  I always end up throwing away about half a can of tomato paste when I need some, but with it in these tubes you just squeeze out what you need, put the cap back on and put it in the refrigerator.  Not only is it there for your next use it really saves time as well.  I love it!!!!

review/text: Have you ever wasted lots of tomato paste because you only needed a small amount from the can for your recipe? (The left-over can go bad very quickly.)<br /><br />Amore Tomato Paste will end that waste, because you can close-up the tube after taking out the tiny amount that you need. Amore also tastes a lot better than the usual supermarket brands available.<br /><br />This is a great product to try. Once you do, you'll never go back to the supermarket cans!

review/summary: RESPONSE TO "B. DAVIS" ON METAL FACTOR
review/text: Well, now I'm totally confused.  Thought these totally eliminated the metal factor in cans [aside from the waste factor as well after opening].  I naturally assumed that the tubes were all plastic as many tubes are for other things, and that's why it survives in the fridge.  Where do you store the rest of the tubes before using, before opening.  Is it safe to be even IN the metal before open as CANS are not after an expiration date?  This is a lot of money to spend all at once on tomato paste not knowing if even "IT" will go bad.  Rachael Ray's and other cooks buy their supplies almost daily, not in `bulk' so that's fine for them but not for me, I always buy in bulk, not shopping often.  Another suggestion is to flatten out the paste in a zip lock bag, freeze, then break off portions as used, being thin enough it's easy, OR freeze portions in ice cube tray then put into zip locks when totally frozen, or on any surface temporarily also putting into zips when frozen.  But that also can be a pain, having to do that all the time.  Seriously considering whether to get these, especially knowing they're metal tubes or even lined with metal.  Can't find in any stores in NYC and getting very frustrated for a long time since I don't travel around to markets.  I have many little cans of Paste always but think, "ahhh, why open one just for this" or for that and getting fed up not using them.  Just threw out another remainder of 8 oz. can which I thought I'd use soon, but didn't and forgot about, in fridge otherwise I would have put the whole thing [in an empty marjorine cup] into the freezer for when I `felt' like making portions but forgot, therefore another almost full can into the trash.  Enough already with the cans.  It's 2010 and they should be more readily available, but guess the manufacturers love this 'can' game to induce more waste, therefore more sales.  Thought the tubes were the answer, but now this makes me wonder about the metal in the tubes as well.  I don't use things up that quickly for even the tubes to go fast,  but thought they were at least safe.

review/summary: Great idea! And yummy, too :)
review/text: You know how some schools want "halloween" parties to be called "fall" parties, being sensitive to folks who don't celebrate Halloween?  Well, our school is one of them...and this treat makes the perfect contribution to our fall-themed party.  Even though it could equally be used to create spooky jack-o-lantern treats, it can also be used just to make pretty pumpkins that fit right in with our fall theme.  And of course you can't go wrong with a rice krispies treat!  Kids love them (and so do I).  My daughters loved the rice krispies treats pumpkins (which were easy to mold with the enclosed molds and fun to decorate, too) and can't wait to make some to share with their friends.

review/summary: mild, sweet and tart tasting
review/text: I've been buying Haribo for years, and swear by everyone of their candies. On a regular basis I buy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT06K">Haribo Gummi Candy, Fizzy Cola, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0036QD9VC">Haribo Roulettes, 36-Count Box</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVT042">Haribo Gummi Candy, Original Gold-Bears, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> etc. etc. Haribo's have a nice taste, and kids love them. I recently bought this candy, and first was amazed at how large these are, and secondly how beautiful these are. If you hold up these candies to the light, you can see through them. The texture is more chewy than Haribo as well, but the taste is missing something. More than anything, these gummy bears have a sweet tarty (not like Sweet tarts, just sweet and tarty, and a mild flavor) taste. I noticed that these are getting generally great reviews, and I wish I could have had the same experience. Overall, I like the price on these, as they are reasonably priced, but I prefer Haribo.<br /><br />*** on a side note, the purple ones (I'm guessing grape) tastes the best, although my pack had mostly orange and red. The purples had a nice flavor, and I'd rate the purple as a 5 star product, although IN MY OPINION, the others weren't as good.<br /><br />*** on another side note, I gave this gummy candy to others, and many of them actually said that this was better than the Haribo, and they liked the fact that this was chewier. so, just because it isn't to my liking doesn't mean that this isn't a five star product. it's all a matter of preference I guess.

review/text: I was looking forward to using this sauce as a marinade as well as a sauce for a quick bowl of noodles and veggies.  However, I found it to be very bland and ended up adding sesame oil, soy sauce, chopped garlic, green onions & chili paste.  I mixed the aforementioned ingredients and added a bit of sugar.<br /><br />If you are accustomed to cooking with dried shitakes, ginger, etc. and making your own sauce, this sauce will not bridge the gap between home made and store bought sauces.<br /><br />I can not recommend this sauce, if you want to try it, dont buy 6 bottles...find a store/site that will sell one at a time.

review/summary: perfect
review/text: This salt is perfect for finishing a dish, you want to use it on your food just before you eat it. The salt crystals are all different sizes, some big chunks and some small so when you put a little sprinkle on your salads, fish, meats, capriccios , anything, it gives your food a nice crunch that makes the taste difference from homemade food to a fancy gourmet meal. I like to always have it in my kitchen. This is not a salt you would add to something while it is cooking because the salt will disintegrate  and that is not the point of using this salt. You want to bite down on the different sized grains as you are eating.
