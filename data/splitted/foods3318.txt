review/summary: Glutino Sans Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: My 14 year old was recently diagnosed with celiac.  It has been difficult finding snacks that she enjoys and can bring to school.  We have found these pretzels to be great, really delicious.  Even her friends prefer them to regular pretzels.

review/text: This product comes to us from the Middle East, which represents so much carbon impact for a food product that gluten-free folks (such as myself) may be purchasing frequently.  There are other gluten-free products made in this country which have similar quality...which is how I'm going to spend my money.

review/summary: Great deal on best GF pretzels I've found!
review/text: I fell in love with Glutino stick pretzels when I started a gluten-free diet six months ago. I actually think they taste better than the regular pretzels I used to eat! The only downside was the price -- the local store charged $8.99 per 14 ounce bag. When I checked on Amazon, I was pleased to find they carry Glutino pretzels. Interestingly, the 8 ounce bags turn out to be a better price per ounce than the 14 ounce ones, so that's what I ordered. With the subscribe and save deal, the 8-ounce bags came out at just over $3 apiece. If you or your gluten-free child loves pretzels for a snack, and you have the space to store a dozen bags, this is an awesome deal! I have a handful of friends who also are gluten-free, so I've shared some of my order with them. These are amazingly good pretzels and Amazon's subscribe and save price is the best you're going to find anywhere!!

review/text: Of all of the gluten free pretzels I have tried, these by far are the best.  They are close to the real thing as I recall.  Sometimes they are difficult to obtain.  Stores do not stock them since they are a bit pricey but well worth it for those of us who are gluten-intolerant.  These are a must for me.

review/summary: Get these if need a POWERFUL LAXATIVE
review/text: I purchased these at a local store, and had half a bag for lunch.  They tasted OK, but were definitely not worth the after effects.  Within about 7 hours after eating these my stomach started feeling awkward.  Shortly after I started having cramps and severe watery diarrhea several times throughout the evening and late night.  Looking at the ingredients, the thing that stands out is carboxymethylcellulose AKA cellulose gum.  The package I purchased said cellulose gum on the ingredients list, but on the web sites it is listed as carboxymethylcellulose.  You will find they are synonyms if you Google them.  All I had for breakfast that day was a bowl of dry corn flakes, and didn't have time to eat dinner before my stomach started cramping.  If you look up this ingredient, or look it up along with "side effects" you will find it is undigestible and can cause side effects such as bloating and diarrhea.  Never again.  All I can say is please post a review if this happened to you to others are forewarned!

review/text: As far as the product goes - these are excellent.  Can't even tell they're gluten free.  Nice and crispy and good flavor.  Usually they're packed well but the boxed was partially crushed on this last shipment and half the pretzels were broken. They had slapped a shipping label right over the "fragile" that was printed on the box.  Not good thinking.

review/summary: Awesome snack choice for Celiacs
review/text: I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight "burnt" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.

review/summary: Best Gluten-Free Pretzel - I love these!!!
review/text: I love these pretzels.  They are just hard to find.  I think pretzels have too much salt on them and I am always trying to scratch off the salt with my finger nails or a knife or something.  Even if I wasn't trying to watch my salt intake I try to take the salt off because they just put too much salt on pretzels.  These pretzels are really very good tasting.  I was afraid because they are gluten free they wouldn't taste very good because a lot of the gluten free products you sacrifice taste.  But not with these.  These are very close to regular pretzels and I am so glad they come in salt free.  I buy them by the case.

review/summary: Glutino Gluten Free Pretzels
review/text: If you Celiac or just perfer gluton-free, these pretzels are a good substitution for both other pretzels and other types of snacks. Despite what O'Reilly used as a tip at the end of his show, gluten-free usually mean more "carbs" for a similar serving.<br /> But as a Celiac, varity is truly the spice of life. Celiacs first response to diagnosis is to see all the walls between them and what used to be their favorite foods. Celiacs in this day and age are so much luckier than previous generations. Firstly, because Doctors are running the proper blood tests to diagnosis gluten-intolerance much more frequently. It might appear as if more folks are stricken with this these days, but I am convinced that is just because of this increased knowlegde by the Doctors.<br /> As to these pretzels. They may or may not strike you as better than your previous favorite, but you now understand that the previous favorite were the cause of "palor", malnutrision and gastro issues. So you must resign yourself to exploring the every expanding gluten-free offerings.<br /> These are not your Philly soft pretzels, but they make a great salty and crunchy "chip" with which to scoop up some hummus, peanutbutter, etc.<br /> Also, this size bag and the Amazon price for a box of these every month or two is one of the most affordable ways to enjoy these healthful snacks. They also good straight from the bag, but it easy to get carried away.<br /> My wife and I found out about my Celiac 5 years ago. It makes you read everylabel on every product you bring into your house. You may even go as far a throwing out all porous (i.e. wooden) utensils, your old toaster and several other things and can't be guaranteed sanitazied.<br /> You learn to trust mostly the food you make yourself, but when you learn that you can trust Glutino, and you can, subscribe to Amazon for regularly scheduled deliveries of all types of life giving goodies like the Pamela's Pancake Mix which go great with chopped, toasted walnuts, blueberries and a couple of raisins although, most maple, agava and other syrups are still safe.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EVG8HY">Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 14.1-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a>

Amazon S&S is the perfect place to find them at a good price per bag or price per ounce compared to a lot of grocery stores.<br /><br />These pretzels are so good I usually don't buy regular pretzels anymore and just eat a couple of these when I want to eat pretzels.<br /><br />If I had to make any negative comment it would be that they could probably use a little more salt.

review/summary: Wonderful Treat - Better Than Non-Gluten Pretzels
review/text: Not only is this snack delicious but it's one of the first items to be even better than regular pretzels that have wheat.  The recipe produces a light and very crispy pretzel, doesn't get stale after leaving it a month in ziploc like other pretzels.  Everyone that I've shared with agrees with me.  So it is very expensive though for those who cannot eat gluten, it's a must have.  I buy it by the case and sparingly share with others!

This means I can choose snacks from either side of the fence so to speak. I think that these Glutino GF pretzels taste better than most "regular" pretzels. Less salty than most non GF pretzels too which I think helps bring out their better flavor.<br /><br />These tend to be a little messy - the sesame seeds fall off quite a bit - not so much they aren't on the pretzel but enough that a couple of teaspoons wind up in the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />The only quibble is cost; these are usually more expensive than another equally good choice of GF pretzel that I enjoy - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047IG6OU">Snyder's of Hanover Gluten Free All Natural Pretzel Sticks 8-oz, 12 pack</a>.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and highly recommended.

review/text: I found these pretzels originally when I started eating a primarily gluten-free diet.  They taste great!  I had been getting them from my grocery store, but they are rather expensive, so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon for a less expensive price and I was able to get them for even less when I got them on auto-ship.  These pretzels are my main snack food and even my family loves them.  I would highly recommend them.

She even packed up some to take with her after tasting them. She was surprised, because she thought they were going to be salty - like "normal" pretzels.

review/text: These are my favorite of the gluten free pretezels but they are expensive. So I decided to order a case from Amazon. I was VERY disappointed when the package arrived. They sent the regular pretzels and further the order said no returns. I called and they did refund my money but did not offer to send me the right product. I would rather have had the sesame pretzel rings I ordered. I won't order anything else bulk from here. I have had such good luck ordering from Amazon I was really disappointed with this order and Amazon :(  I gave a one star on the review because I did not get the product I ordered. The pretzels are a 5 star in my book.

review/summary: I love these pretzels!!!
review/text: I recently discovered these at a local Walmart priced at about $5 or $6 a bag (about 4 servings).  I decided to check on Amazon and loved the lower price.  A case of 12 bags for about $31.  I have not been diagnosed with Celiac disease (so far), but I am very sensitive to gluten and to oats (migraines, intestinal pains, diarrhea).  These pretzels have never once caused a reaction of any kind , even if I pig out on an entire bag in one weekend.  The only negative thing I could say is that the fat count in higher than I'd like. 8 grams for 32 pretzels.  Salt content is moderately high at 540mg, but they are pretzels after all.  I highly, highly recommend these pretzels.

Now I use that same recipe for my grown-up kids and their families using all gluten free ingredients. Glutino pretzel sticks are the best; they're light, with just enough salt, and none of that bitter after-taste that many gf pretzels have. They are my first choice.

review/summary: Where have all the pretzels gone?
review/text: I recently purchased the 20-pack of 2.6 oz. bags of Glutino Gluten Free Pretzel Twists. They are excellent and my family agrees! The 2.6 oz. bag makes it easy to control portions for those who (like me) are on a restricted diet. Unfortunately, when I tried to re-order within the last week, they are not available or no longer stocked. Upon searching for other suppliers, I found a few who have these available. However, they are available at a higher price than on Amazon. I already consider these great tasting pretzels to be a splurge item - if you do the math you find they are a little pricey for a snack item, even at Amazon's price. I truly hope these Glutino gluten-free pretzels will soon become available. I had planned to buy them again and again. They are a good-tasting, crisp and crunchy, very satisfying snack food.

review/summary: nice, creamy, smooth
review/text: This heats up quick to the touch but the taste isn't as good as the nature's way. My skin looks smooth and more moisturized than my EVOO...looks nice on my face but this is my first time using, maybe I will update in a month or so. Overall pretty decent product...i can see where it reminds me of bacon grease lol<br /><br />UPDATE (1/14/2012)<br />This product gets really HARD in the winter and hard to warm up but in the summertime I had to put it in the fridge to keep it hard but it easily warmed up in the summer as oppose to the winter...I didn't use this much in the summer since my natural oils are present and I use those as much as I can but in the winter I am EXTREMELY dry and have flakey skin so I use this as a night time moisturizer and my face looks so glowy in the morning but I do need more moisture at times but I use this mainly as body lotion in the summer time since EVOO is too thick

review/summary: Barlean's Coconut Oil
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a> I kept hearing about the benefits of using coconut oil for my hair which is very thick & can get really dry. This product did NOT disappoint!!! Due to a wrist injury, I was unable to comb my own hair so I got it braided & had to wear it that way for about 5 weeks. I used the coconut oil in my hair during this time. I couldn't believe how soft my hair was once I took the braids out. My scalp & the ends of my hair stayed well moisturized & my hair was amazingly soft. In addition, it can also be used for your skin & for cooking!!!

review/summary: 1 Star based only on bad packaging  : (
review/text: Maybe ordering this product in August was a bad move on my part, but I never stopped to consider that heat would affect the shipment the way it did mine.  Even though the jar is factory-sealed AND there is a foil seal inside, it STILL leaked out!!  The product was shipped via the USPS in a bubble envelope.  The product was shoved into my metal mailbox on its side and left to bake in the 90-degree heat, and when we opened the mailbox we were surprised to see that even the bubble envelope was covered in oil, thereby leaking oil onto the rest of our mail.  I opened up the envelope over a trashcan and retrieved the jar of coconut oil with a towel (for both gripping and cleaning purposes), and about 1/3 of the product had leaked out.  Yes, somehow a factory-sealed jar with a foil seal which was shipped inside a plastic bubble-wrap lined envelope still managed to seep out and leave a gooey mess all over the rest of our mail!<br /><br /> I can't attest to whether or not this product is any good because I decided to throw it out.  I will say, however, that even though the oil didn't quickly absorb into my skin (as some people say it does), after I washed my hands I noticed that my skin felt a bit softer.  Always a silver lining in every cloud -- haha!  I'm pretty disappointed because I really wanted to try this product based on all of the great reviews it received, so maybe I'll order again in the winter.  I think it should be shipped in a box rather than an envelope, though, as it stands a better chance of being delivered upright that way.

review/summary: The BEST tasting coconut oil hands down!!
review/text: I have tried three different brands of coconut oil: Barlean's, Nutiva, and Tropical Traditions. The VIRGIN coconut oil has a nice, light coconut flavor.  The EXPELLER pressed coconut oil has no flavor. So, if you a buying virgin coconut oil here's my tip: Barlean's had the best flavor and smell...I wanted to eat it right out of the jar it smelled so good, tasted phenomenal!! Barlean's was the most expensive of the three but for the flavor worth it. Nutiva was a close second in taste & smell and is more economical. Tropical Traditional (which I have always loved their products in the past) did not measure up in flavor. In fact it had a strange, burnt taste and smell...something was off about it. If you want no coconut flavor at all, get the expeller pressed coconut oil. It is less expensive than virgin coconut oil...all three companies use proper, healthy, non-chemical practices to extract the oil, so I would go with the best buy for the expeller cold pressed oil but pay a little more for the flavored version.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VLZ8D0">Barlean's Organic Oils Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 16-Ounce Jar</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VVVJ6W">32-oz glass - Gold Label Organic Virgin Coconut Oil - 1 quart</a>

review/summary: A good brand of coconut oil.
review/text: Not all coconut oil is created equal in my eyes. I've tried several brands, and for whatever reason, some smell better than others. This one smells outstanding--a mild sweet coconut scent (as opposed to some that almost have a more savory, toasted coconut flake scent). And at less than $13, the price point is very decent. This is the second time I've tried this brand of coconut oil, and I continue to be satisfied with it. I don't keep it in the refrigerator.<br /><br />I use coconut oil for my skin on a daily basis, I also take a spoon of it each morning, and I use it to cook certain dishes.<br /><br />For those of you who have never used coconut oil, keep in mind that it's liquid when it's warm, and it solidifies when the temperature dips below 76 degrees Fahrenheit. So don't tilt your jar sideways on a warm day, because the liquidy oil will spill out; and don't be surprised when you open your jar on a slightly cooler day and see a solid white mass!<br /><br />Because it is in a jar as opposed to a bottle, I recommend using a clean spoon to take out what you need (as opposed to your hands) so that you keep the contents of your jar as clean and bacteria-free as possible. If you do put your hands in the jar to scoop out oil, make sure you wash them with soap first, and dry them thoroughly before putting your fingers inside so that you don't contaminate the oil.

review/text: I had read that organic coconut oil was good for healing skin yeast infections so I thought I'd try it.  This is alot of coconut oil for the price!!  It smells clean and like coconut ( of course!)  It cleared up my minor infection within days.  I use the oil all over now because it goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin rather quickly.  Don't leave it in the sun because the heat will warm it to liquid!

review/summary: SUPER HEALING!
review/text: I purchased this product to try and remedy my extremely dry hands and bleeding, cracked cuticles.  I am a nurse and I wash my hands A LOT at work.  Lotion was just not doing anything. My cuticles were like Black Swan, seriously!  I was in pain and putting myself at risk for infection from my patients.  I purchased this and put some in a squeezy tube and started bringing it to work and putting it on several times per day.  MY HANDS ARE HEALED.  Cuticles are normal again.  I put this on at least once per day in order to maintain my hands.  SO happy with this product.  It smells great.  Also I have occasionally put it on my face before bed and I have been getting compliments on how great my skin looks.  Love it! Love it!  Love it!<br /><br />UPDATE: I do not recommend using a squeezy tube during cold weather.  It was hard to squeeze out.  In the summer it was fine, but now I keep it in a small twisty topped jar.

It's a balm-like texture, but quickly melts with your normal body heat, smells fantastic, goes on smooth but doesn't leave you feeling oily.  I use it for a lot of things, but the main thing I'm loving it for is as a facial moisturizer!  It's the best!  I can put it on after a shower, before bed, in the morning before putting on makeup, whatever... and no oily residue is left behind!

review/summary: minimal coconut smell and flavor
review/text: This review is about eating the oil, not using it topically on the skin.<br /><br />The Barleans coconut oil tastes the same as the Wilderness Naturals, which has a very mild coconut smell and flavor.  The Barleans doesn't say it is raw, though, so I gave it three stars, compared to four stars for Wilderness Naturals.  The Wilderness Naturals is only a good deal in the gallon bucket, though.<br /><br />This Barleans coconut oil is my third favorite, is a decent deal for a small 16 oz size, and should be fine since it's cold pressed, but it is definitely not in the same class as the Barleans flax oil.<br /><br />I usually order the Aloha Nu (the standard of comparison with five stars), which is raw and has a strong smell and flavor of coconut, but they have been out of stock for a long time and may no longer be available.

We have tried a combination of cremes, oils and lubes on our quest to find one that:<br /><br />-is nice and slick<br />-doesn't dry out<br />-has a pleasant aroma and taste<br />-doesn't irritate the skin (i must have sensitive skin b/c several of the commercial ones gave me slight rashes)<br />-can wind up internally (sometimes one thing leads to another ;-)<br />-something that can be left on the nightstand<br /><br />I was shocked and surprised when I saw some comments on Coconut oil.  We have been using it for over a month now and really enjoying it.  It works well on skin and hair, tastes really good, and has a very pleasant aroma.  You can leave it un-refrigerated on the nightstand.  Best of all it is pretty inexpensive.

review/summary: Natural Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil
review/text: I purchased this product for the sole purpose of natural hydration for my body. I like the fact that it is all natural, no preservatives or chemicals. My friend recommended using natural products for the face and the body. So I tried this one out. My skin tends to get very dry especially in the summer time. I am searching for a product that can be effective for my special needs. At first, it is a little greasy, when I apply it in the mornings. Sometimes, it comes off on the leather couch when I watch the morning news. I might need to reapply several times for the maximum hydrating effect. My skin tends to dry out as the day goes on. For now, I like it. But the real test seems to be when summer hits, but I am not sure how the sunblock will work with it (or against it).
