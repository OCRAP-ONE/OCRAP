review/summary: Must Have for My Dogs
review/text: I love the C.E.T. chews for my dogs! I have Chihuahuas and Shih Tzus. Both breeds have mouth shapes that are a challenge to find a chew that they will/can use. The C.E.T. Chews are not uniform in size and thickness but because of the different mouths here that is a plus.For the very aggressive chewers here I give the thickest of all to. For the guys with the smaller mouths that don't chew very much I use the thinnest chews. I have read many reviews about how to cut these chews to smaller sizes to fit the dog. One was to soak the chew in water to soften it but it would remove some of the good qualities of the chews and I didn't like that. I tried to cut them by holding them with pliers and using a hacksaw. Well that was nuts and just didn't work. Finally I decided to try a pair of new tree branch loping shears to cut the chews and found success at last.This way I don't have to have so many  bags of different sizes. I do have a very Spoiled Chihuahua here that will not use any of the chew toys I provide. His month is very tiny which would make cleaning with a tooth scaler hard plus he gets upset if he has to stay at the vet. These chews are the only thing he will chew at all to get tarter off his teeth.

review/summary: My dog LOVES these
review/text: These rawhide chews were originally available at my vet's office, recommended as healthy snacks and good for her teeth. But then I moved away and my new vet didn't carry them so I was glad to be able to find them on amazon.com. My dog will do anything for these chews, and I can be assured of 15 minutes of peace and quiet while she works on chewing one up. They just appear to be pieces of rawhide, but for some reason my dog thinks they're the greatest. They don't smell, don't make a mess or fall apart, and the dog goes nuts for them. What more could I want!

I've been using this product for 8 months, and then my cockapoo tried to swallow a huge piece of this.  She was chocking!  My husband had to stick his finger down her throat and pull it out.  It had blood on it.  She was ok, but what if my husband was in the garage instead of in the living room to see this all happening?  So, just letting everyone know what happened.

review/text: I bought these as an alternative to other oral hygiene products based on price - probably not a great decision.  The chips are a lot smaller than standard rawhide chips you might buy in a regular pet store or supermarket, and my dog (25 lbs.) doesn't seem to love them.  Might be size-appropriate for dogs &lt;15 lbs.

review/text: My wife came home with these from Petco(for $25 plus tax). My dog loves them more than any other kind of chew and for $13 a bag from amazon, you can't go wrong. I can see where some dogs would just try to shallow them whole as other reviews state but I'm not having as much a problem with them. Also, I just ordered the large chews b/c they are actually $1 cheaper than the medium. Go figure.

review/text: Even for "medium" sized chews, our 2 rat terriers (8 lbs and 13 lbs) breezed through these.  They hardly spent much time at all actually chewing them.  I ordered another bag, this time trying the large ones, to see if they last a little longer. I got them hoping it would help improve their breath a little bit. There may be a small improvement, but it hasn't been that long so I'm not sure if they're doing the trick or not. We'll see.

review/text: Both my dogs got terrible gas after chewing these! For two days. Not sure about the dental cleaning part but the gas was enough to not buy them again. We have two corgis and I would not recommend the medium size for corgis-they are too small. My dogs just got them soggy enough to chew like gum and swallow. There wasn't a whole lot of chewing because they were too small so I doubt they do a great job cleaning their teeth.

review/text: I haven't really noticed if they help keep the dogs' teeth cleaner, but they certainly don't hurt, and the dogs like them as much as normal rawhides, so I'll keep using them. My dogs are 15 pounds,and I accidentally got the small chews once, which they crunched up immediately. These last a lot longer. I'm considering doing what other people do and buying the large ones and cutting them in half. I use this, along with CET oral hygiene rinse and a Nylabone water additive, and I brush their teeth when I remember. With all of those combined, their teeth are pretty clean and their breath doesn't smell as bad as it used to.

review/text: Noticed my 8 yr old yorkie's breath getting bad. Had been using greenies and related products in past. Problem with those is the dog bites huge chunks off and just swallows them, so only does so much teeth cleaning. I've tried other chews before, and found that my dog gets bored of them, and then just starts hiding them all over the place. These chews are awesome! Been giving for a few weeks now, and she loves to chew them. Provide a good 20 min of chewing. Give one per day to dob as part of diet. They love it. Works great. Breath is better definitely. Will be buying these monthly going forward.

review/text: I have two nine year old Cairn Terriers.  I have been trying everything to keep their teeth clean to avoid putting them under anesthesia to have their teeth cleaned by my veterinarian.  I bought these and my guys would not go near them.  They look great and smell good too.  I finally gave them to my neighbor who just adopted a rescue Cockapoo pup.  He is still a puppy and liked them because he needs to chew all the time.  So, if you are planning on buying these, just know that I tried them, they look great, but they got rejected.  Some pups like them and some pups do not.  They made a great welcome gift for the new adopted puppy and that makes me feel great, so my investment was not wasted.

With these, he loves the flavor and he actually eats them.  His last dental check-up was so much better than last year!  Don't know what you've done to these rawhide's to make them so tasty and good for him, but thank you so much.  Also, the cost is very reasonable for how many you get in a bag.

review/summary: CET Hygiene chews
review/text: Both my chihuahuas will only chew on these briefly, but don't go all out, which probably means the CET chews won't help with plaque build-up. Luckily I can brush the teeth of the little one. The other, larger one won't allow me to brush his teeth, but he eats a Greenie every day and his teeth are better than they were without them.

review/summary: Small price - Big rewards
review/text: My vet initially recommended the CETA hygiene for  my darlin' doggies,  Boomer, Barnum and Aubie, and suprisingly they absolutely  loved it!  I'm generally skeptical when anyone suggests I purchase a particular item that comes from their own store, but this [...] item is awesome!  It freshens their breath and cleans their teeth between those "super expensive vet cleanings" AND my doggies love it!!  The prices here are better than discount stores, better than my vet and better other websites. It can also arrive the next day w Amazon Prime!!!!  I love "taking care of my babies and keeping them healthy!"  Even more so when I know my budget isn't strained!  Amazon's Greenies are fantastic, too!  I use both and just alternate days. I highly reommend these and the Greenies!

review/summary: To Thick
review/text: Product works and our dog loves them.  She is diabetic which requires that we keep her from having any gum problems that could become very serious.  Our biggest issue with the product is the medium size chews sometimes are to thick for a medium size dog to chew and we wind up throwing half the bag away wich really increaes the overall cost of the product.

review/summary: Better than your usual rawhide chews
review/text: These chews were recommended by my vet for a miniature Schnauzer who was having digestive problems with regular rawhide. Virbac chews are treated with materials for dental care. My dog is an aggressive chewer and even a medium sized chew gives him 5 to 10 minutes of chewing enjoyment with no negative digestion side effects.

review/text: Worked excellent on dogs built up plaque. Saved me $300 on teeth cleaning, it was so bad I didnt think anything but a grinder would get it off, but most of it is gone.<br /><br />Worked ok on his breath, still a problem there though. Highly recommend it for any plaque build up.<br /><br />Also would only give one at a time and take away old ones before giving a new one, my dog would only eat it if it was "special" ie: his only one, otherwise they all lied around the house barely chewed.

I have three dogs and went through the bag rather quickly then went online and found I could buy direct for a much better price.  I continue to buy these as they are a favorite of my dogs.  It is also a favorite for me as their breath is much better!  They LOVE this and consider it a treat and at the same time it is helping them!

review/text: I have a small dog and these chews work great. Teeth got whiter, breath improved tremendously and my dogs loves them. My only problem is that they get very slippery when chewed and my dog has swallowed some of these chews almost whole, I am afraid he will choke and not be able to get it out of his throat. Please be with your dog when you give him one of these chews. I now hold on to the chew and let him chew it while I am holding it. The instructions say not to touch the chews so be sure to wash your hands after you touch them.

review/text: If you want to avoid visiting the porcelain throne after eating these, follow a couple of simple rules:<br /><br />- Don't consume these on an empty stomach - have them after you have eaten something first.  An after meal dessert is perfect for these candies, as are any candies containing maltitol.<br />- Limit your consumption - don't eat the whole bag.<br /><br />If you ignore one or both of these rules, be prepared to clear your schedule for the inevitable bathroom visit.

review/summary: Great treat if you are trying to reduce sugar or net carbs
review/text: I was quite skeptical about these little treats when I first saw them, but I have to say that these are a great treat if you are missing a little candy treat on the Atkins or a reduced sugar diet.  Be aware that you cannot sit there and eat the whole bag as you will pay for your gluttony at the throne of the porcelain god.  So only eat 1 or 2, then put the bag down. FYI, some people just cannot digest sugar alcohols without the GI side effects or migraines so you might want to try out a little bag of these from the store before you buy in bulk from Amazon.  Overall, great treat if you are minimally effected by sugar alcohols.

review/text: they really taste like the real thing, just subtle differences.. the peanut butter is a bit more smooth and a bit less moist/gritty then the real thing, but it's subtle. There's also an ever so slight, barely noticeable 'sugar alcohol cool' effect. My only suggestion would be to use Erythritol as the sweetener, since that has the least calories and least issues with digestion, since it's excreted via the kidneys.  Like all 'sugar free' foods that contain any sugar alcohol other then Erythritol, these will have a laxative effect.

I did some googling and apparently these are the effects of the sugar alchohol maltitol. I can't believe this ingrediant is even allowed and the only warning on the label was small, on the back, and something about individuals who are sensitive could experience a laxative effect.  Seriously? I will never again buy a product that contains maltitol.

review/summary: Addicted
review/text: I first encountered these in my Nike Womens Half Marathon goodie bag. I actually didn't eat them right away but in an attempt to procrastinate one fine day, I found myself devouring these. Obviously, I liked them so much that I ended up ordering more from Amazon! It has a balanced taste of both the cinnamon/brown sugar and sunflower seeds, definitely just the right amount of sweet.  They are a great afternoon snack or snack on the go.

review/summary: Yummy sunflower power snack for on the go!
review/text: This on-the-go snack was very convenient for me to pack along in my lunch to enjoy later on in the day. I always seem to get hungry at that four o'clock hour so this was a nice semi-sweet nutritious snack that kept me feeling satisfied until dinner.

review/summary: Delicious and VERY Healthy Coconut Milk!
review/text: I've been making various kinds of curry for about 20 years now and this A Taste of Thai Lite Coconut Milk is by far the best lower-fat variety available.  YES, it is very true that full-fat coconut milk is a lot creamier and tastier, BUT IF you are trying to be healthier, OR you want to be able to have MORE curry without getting fat and clogging your arteries, then this is for you!  There are other varieties out there that may be less expensive, but I personally feel more comfortable with the canning done by A Taste of Thai.  These cans are clean and look sterile as opposed to others that may leave you feeling less confident.  It's all personal opinion and subjective determination though!

review/summary: Water is the first ingredient! Thats why it tastes like water!
review/text: The reason why this is 58% less fat and  calories than the regular is because water is the first ingredient..........<br />there is no water at all in the regular Coconut milk and its the same price in the stores. Save your money and buy the<br />regular and add your own water! You will have  watery coconut milk and it will be a lot cheaper!

review/summary: This stuff is crap
review/text: I cannot begin to tell you just how crappy this stuff is. Sure, it's 'lite', (4.5g total fat). But, as this stuff pours like water, is flavourless, and altogether unacceptable as a 'Coconut Milk', WHAT'S THE POINT? One would be better-off adding water to their recipe and a teaspoon of 'Coconut Extract'. Ugh. Save your money on this horror of a product as it's neither worth the time, trouble, or expense. An utter disappointment all the way round; (p.s. I bought it cuz my local market was outta the 'real' stuff... and I tell you, never again. I wouldn't serve this stuff to a dog).

I love the milkshakes, add milk and ice and blend to an amazing flavorful milkshake that is just the best ! My son loves it with cold leftover coffee, and ice a touch of milk, and he has cut some of the calories and has a 'guilt free' dessert and loves it soooo much. Family fun for everyone!

review/text: Very good-tasting Chai according to my taste buds, and nice to use hot water instead of milk.  Convenient 1-use packaging.  I ordered it dispite the shipping charge (which was more than the product), but I will not order it again because of that. I just wanted to give it a try due to liking Oregon Chai.

review/summary: ALMOST as good as a Clark Bar
review/text: Unfortunately, like the Clark Bar, this product is not sold in Southern California, SO, I have to get it from Amazon.  When I saw that I could get it on Amazon Prime, there was no longer any debate.<br /><br />The 5th Avenue is a Clark Bar wannabe, but far superior to the Nestle product called Butterfinger.  It has a very nice crunch, and a very nice hint of Peanut Butter.  If you have to accept an alternative to the Clark bar, this is pretty close.<br /><br />All of the Clark bars that Amazon sells are not available for Amazon Prime, and all of the vendors selling the Clark bars want entirely too much for shipping (Like, half of the price again???  Come-On Man!!!)

review/text: I made killer sloppy joes with this stuff by soaking and then mixing up as usual with my recipe ingredients. Would i want to sit down to a big bowl of plain TSP? Not so much. But with flavorings, it makes a really nicely textured ground meat analog. And it's not squeaky when you chew it.

review/text: it's okay, but I would prefer a larger nugget type product. This ends up powder at the bottom of the bag.<br />Overall, it's a good deal, especially since it's organic.  Add a little flavoring and you can replace most uses for hamburger, or stretch that organic lb. of beef into 2.
