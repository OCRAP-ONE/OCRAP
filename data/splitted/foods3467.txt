review/summary: Not for super sensitive stomach
review/text: I was so looking forward to enjoy this tea and was imagining how wonderful it would be to have a cup of hot sweet ginger tea in the coming winter....unfortunately my stomach was not up to the `task'.  I have a sensitive stomach and get heartburn and acid reflux if I drink coffee or most of the over-the-counter orange juice.  I thought it's safe to drink this ginger tea but I ended up having mild heartburn every time after I drank the tea (even use just half bag of the powder).  And the same condition occurred after all three attempts, so I had to give up...  I did find out that I am ok with drinking the home-made ginger tea (three slices of ginger in boiling water and some sugar).  I would still recommend this to people with no stomach problems!!

review/summary: Strong, but good
review/text: I ordered this product after a friend of my mother's told her about it. My mother's friend uses it because she gets nauseous on a regular basis and ginger, which this product has in spades, helps a lot.<br /><br />I have a brain tumor which causes me to experience vertigo, dizziness, and nausea - all on a fairly regular basis. I have medication, ONDANSETRON HCL 8MB to be exact, which works, but gives me an incredible headache as a side effect of making my nausea go away. As a result, I need to take Aspirin at the very least, with the medication to offset the side effect. NOT a pleasant experience to say the least.<br /><br />I've had ginger before as part of juicing, which I do from time to time after watching the movie FAT, SICK, AND NEARLY DEAD (available via Amazon Prime streaming video and Hulu). However, I don't have the energy to make juice as often as I would like.<br /><br />This tea allows me to get some ginger into my system much easier. The ginger doesn't have the side effects that the aforementioned medication does, so it's my first choice. This tea is WAY too strong as is though. Instead of using a whole packet in a large cup of water, I use a teaspoon, and go from there if I need more ginger to relax my stomach. At least this means that the tea will last much longer.<br /><br />If you have chronic nausea for whatever reason, I'd give this stuff a try, just beware of the strength and be prepared to adjust the amount you use, unless you want your throat to burn from the high concentration of ginger.

review/text: This tea is awesome! Authentic Ginger flavor. Certainly clears the sinuses.  If you like the stimulating, fresh flavor and aroma of Ginger, then this tea will please you.  Additionally, I don't have to add any sugar or other sweetener. Also, there are no tea bags to deal with as the crystals dissolve rapidly for the perfect cup.  I like it cold too.  I also add less water than recommended for an even more robust flavor.  I like it strong!

review/summary: Good stuff!
review/text: I bought this for the benefits of ginger and honey, and based on the high reviews. I enjoy hot teas and drinks in general. When I first tried this drink it was a little too spicey for me. I tried cutting it in half and that worked ok. The best solution for me is to add in a little cream or vanilla soy milk. It makes it creamy and just a little spicy like a chai tea. VERY enjoyable and soothing when not feeling well. It's also come in handy for morning sickness recently.

review/summary: I love Ginger any way I can get it.
review/text: One day my mother in law sent me over some of these packets.  I was hooked with the first Packet.  I have a hard time with hot things.  The rest of my family could not tell the burn it gives.  They even like to just pour them into their mouths and let them dissolve.  The more of It I drank I finally got to where I can drink the whole packet now.  My doctor has taken me away from cream so my morning coffee was just horrible.  I now put one packet of this in my cup then put in a K-cup of my favorite coffee and wow what a wonderful spicy wake me up.<br /><br />I am a diabetic, and someone who does not like to eat.  So getting that little boost of sugar and honey first thing in the morning gives me time to get my breakfast ready.  I have low sugar and my doc is trying to get me to eat at least 1000 kilo/calories to 1400 kilo/calories.  Which is hard to do when you mainly eat raw vegetables and fruits. So for me.  This is a fast way to get my blood sugar up and stay up long enough for me to get some food in me.<br /><br />I know one person complained about the calories.  It does have 18 carbs per packet.  But the Ginger is good and very strong which works very well for settling my stomach. I used to have to take phenergan for nausea now a cup of this and I am good.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this as much as we do.<br />Atheena

review/summary: Not limited to hot beverage
review/text: The Prince of Peace Instant Ginger Honey Crystals originally didn't impress me because the first ingredient was cane sugar, followed by honey and then ginger.  Because we don't drink many sweet beverages, the 70 calories and 17 sugar grams seemed outrageous.  We also were not thrilled with the biblical proverbs imprinted on the packaging.  After opening the first pouch, however, our family was hooked on the spicy sweet crystals.  Each pouch contains 12 grams of ginger and it is very, very spicy, just what we like around here.  We empty a packet into a little jar and always have some accessible in the kitchen.  I use a little binder clip on a packet in my bag when traveling, so I can slip a few crystals on my tongue even when there's no water available.  I add this to white or green tea, mix it in my chai and add no other sweetener, sprinkle it on yogurt, fruit and fiber cereal in the morning, and even have used it to tone down an overly spicy seafood stew I made last week.  I don't know how, but throwing in about a half teaspoon worked a miracle.  The hot beverage is great when we're nauseous or just feeling less than perfect, and when chilled, is a perfect complement to one of those clear beverages we may drink for relaxation.  If you like ginger, think about taking a break from the ginger chews/candy and try these little delectable crystals instead.

review/text: The packets make an easy and quick way to make a spicy and sweet ginger tea. However, I prefer using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00029JDDE">Ting Ting Jahe Ginger Candy (5.25oz)</a> to make my tea. Every packet has 17g of sugar, yet doesn't taste as sweet as Ting Ting Jahe in my opinion, which has only 3g per piece of candy. I also think that Ting Ting Jahe has a cleaner ginger flavor, but isnt as spicy as this product. This product also takes up more space and isnt as good a value as ting ting jahe. If you are looking for the quickest way to make a drink, these packets are the way to go. However, if you are willing to stir around the ginger candies until they dissolve, the ting ting jahe candies make a much better tasting drink, with less sugar and a cleaner finish. Plus, you can eat them as regular candies if you wish!

I was only able to get down half a glass of this.  If you are pregnant and looking for something to ease your morning sickness, try ginger tea instead.  I got some lemon ginger tea... it is very good!  Also try ginger hard candies.  I got some of those as well.  If you are just a lover of all things ginger, go ahead and try it!

review/summary: Period Rice a Plus
review/text: This rice will set you *way* back for a 2 lb bag, but if you want the heritage strain of rice that along with indigo was the foundation of the Colonial Carolina economy, this is the right stuff.  I cannot speak to its qualities as a side dish, but it is exactly suited for risottos and stews - thick and filling.  As a Revolutionary War reenactor, I splurged on a bag and brought it to an immersion weekend in winter at Jockey Hollow in Morristown, NJ.  1 pound of this rice cooked with venison and carrots on a hearth in a 14 x 16 log hut fed nearly a dozen hungry Continentals. For living historians who want an authentic, period experience, this product will satisfy even the stitch counters in your hobby.  Gourmets and Gourmands in modern times may have other thoughts.

review/summary: A Really Fine Coffee
review/text: I'll admit I had help discovering this brand of coffee; a major consumer review magazine to which I subscribe rated it as one of the best coffees available in the USA. That got me curious so I bought some and have been buying it ever since. It has a marvelous flavor which is never bitter and has always been smooth and rich.<br /><br />The review went on to compliment its aroma and flavor and said it was simply better than the competition and at a lower price. The 100% Columbian uses an Arabica bean which I prefer.<br /><br />For the typical user the ground version is much more convenient unless you have a reasonable method of grinding the beans at home. We have a small batch grinder but it is hard to use and to clean up afterward so I usually get the ground.<br /><br />A number of local stores still carry it but you may not have one in your neighborhood. As many of us have discovered, ordering from Amazon is so easy!<br /><br />In summation, if you enjoy your coffee black this is a very successful alternative to get a great coffee taste at a better than average price.

review/summary: Great coffee but packaging could be better!
review/text: We've become loyal fans of Eight o'clock's ground Columbian coffee! Gives our days a great start!  Do wish Eight O'clock would improve the packaging so I could give their coffee 5 stars. We were hopeful when we saw the ads for 'new package'--but disappointed to find the change is color only.  Wish they would improve the bag's seal to lessen the chances we'll end up tearing the bag when trying to open it, and improve the method for closing the bag to keep the coffee fresh.  The twist tie frequently 'separates' from the bag. It's still our favorite ground coffee; and Amazon's flexible "subscribe-and-save" brings the coffee to our door, letting us adjust our schedule when we have out-of-town guests and run low early or get behind and don't need the scheduled delivery because of vacation.

review/text: other than the occasional starbucks or dunkin donuts, which i only buy when they are on sale and i have deep coupons to get a great deal, 8'o clock reigns supreme in our hose. the unanimous favorites are french vanilla and the colombian roast. it's always smooth, full bodied, never cheap tasting. five stars!

The Yuban was $8 for 2 lbs so I'd prefer Yuban to this.  I think I like the Yuban a little better(my taste) both don't come close to fresh beans. 8 o'clock beans are much better.<br />This stuff is ok but not worth the money, imo.

review/text: This coffee does meet the advertised promise of smoothness and 'lingering sweet taste' yet it is very mild in 'coffee' flavor. Because of this, it will only be one of my occasional alternates. Being a regular coffee drinker, I've tried for years to strike a balance between the quality and price of various coffees. This coffee is a winner in that category, so for anyone who prefers a milder tasting coffee (with less caffeine) I can recommend trying the Eight O'Clock Colombian.

review/text: Let me preface this by saying I am not a coffee snob, nor do I own a crazy expensive coffee machine.  I am a basic, "drink my coffe black" kind of guy.<br /><br />With that said, this coffee is awesome.  I bought this while I was deployed to Afghanistan as the coffee available to me in country was few and none. After reading a bunch of reviews I chose this flavor as I heard it was the best. You get 4 normal sized coffee bags and it last a while too.  This is pretty much the only coffee drink now, yes it's that good.<br /><br />The even bigger plus is that it's readily available everywhere I am stationed in grocery stores (if I chose to buy it that route) and it's rather inexpensive compared to other coffee.<br /><br />Highly recommend for someone looking to branch out and try a new coffee brand.

These treats aren't compromised with a bunch of weird fillers that really aren't good for our pets.  He loves these treats so much that I have been able to teach him 4 new tricks just by holding the bag in front of him. If you like having home deliveries, I recommend the Amazon subscription, it comes out to almost the same price as my neighborhood Walmart but I enjoy the convience of front door deliveries with Amazon.

review/summary: Were Great!  Now??????
review/text: I've been offering Nathan's Hot Dog Treats to my English Springer Spaniel, Sadie, for two years.  All have been ordered from Amazon.  Up until the last batch ordered, a couple of months ago, they were GREAT!  They smelled delicious, a fresh summer sausage aroma.  Although I have never tasted this product, Sadie certainly very much loves them.  However, this last batch had a distinctly different aroma.  It was no longer a fresh beef sausage aroma, it is now an indistinct slightly smoked aroma. It did not smell fresh.  All four individual packages had this appreciably less inviting (to me) aroma.  There was no apparent mold on the product or in the bag.  As always, I kept these treats in the refrigerator both prior to and after they were opened.  Each package had, as alway, a desicant inside it.  Something has changed in their manufacturing and/or packaging?  Although, Sadie still ate them, it was obviously without the prior gusto.  These Nathan's treats are rather expensive; I can go to Walmart and purchase four treat packages, totaling one pound, for less than $5.00 that Sadie will enjoy every bit as much as these present Nathan's treats.  Sadie enjoys all treats given with a few loving words.  The words are free.  Nathan's - you have lost a customer.

review/summary: Received a moldy package
review/text: Sometime ago, I bought these treats for my dog.  They were not being sold by Amazon back then.  I opened a package and the treats were moldy.  I contacted the manufacturer (because Amazon wasn't the seller); they made me send the package back (full of moldy treats) at my expense in order to refund my money.  I'm sure the Postmaster General would have frowned on sending mold thru the mail.  Anyway, I haven't bought them again.

review/text: My family got a dog from the local county animal shelter, a husky/shepherd/retriever mix, and this arrived just in time for the first week mark of him being home. I am currently deployed out of the United States, and the order arrived at home in the States about five days after ordering with regular shipping. My dog loves them, he knew immediately that it was something for him when they came in with the box. Due to canine happiness/feedback, I urge you to get these for your four legged friends :)

review/summary: Dogs loved them
review/text: My dogs enjoyed these, and they are better than the majority of dog treats on the market. I still prefer freeze dried treats consisting of just meat (pure bites are my favorite), but these were a good price and I figured I'd try something different. They kind of leave your hands greasy. They look just like cut up slim jims. Of course my dogs loved them, I consider them a less healthy treat than other treats I usually feed, but still better than feeding something like Beggin Strips or Snausages (YUCK).

review/summary: Best Dog Treat Ever
review/text: I have been a dog "mom" for five years, and in my opinion these are the highest quality dog treats that I have ever purchased.  I am a vegetarian and have never tasted beef myself, but in my opinion the treats look, smell, and feel like real beef.  The package claims that the treats are made from human grade beef and beef hearts, and the treats even require refrigeration after opening.  The treats are rather expensive for the amount of treats in the package, but it's great for when you want to splurge a bit on your dog.

After she was hooked, our Wal-mart stopped handling them and Amazon is the only place that I have found. I would advise any pet owner to try them for their dog. I have gave a bag to my mother and to the neighbor for their dogs and both dogs love the treats too.

He is so cute when I offer him a Nathan's hot dog treat.  He goes around in circles very fast and his hair sticks straight out like a dust mop.

review/text: My dogs go nuts over these and treats like them. They come cut up and are good for a quick reward.  They fit perfect in the treat bags that clip on your leash.  Definitely worth the try, if your dog doesn't like these, he's probably a cat.<br /><br />A good alternative is buying cheap people hot dogs.  There a lot cheaper and you get more for the money.  I cut the up and put them on a plate and freeze them.  Once there frozen toss them in a bag and keep them in the freezer.  They last quite a but longer and keeps the dogs busy for a moment as the deal with the cold.
