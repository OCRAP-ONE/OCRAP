review/text: These work. Within seconds of having torn open the little pheromone packet I was swarmed by male moths. You just need patience. The life cycle of the pantry moth takes time. There may be eggs that haven't hatched yet, and larvae that haven't metamorphosed yet still hanging about. You have to leave the trap out (and according to the directions) for a good long while to catch all the moths. The traps say they are good for 3 months...well you should leave them out that long to make sure you get them all. I believe we have conquered our pantry moth problem using the Safer brand traps.

review/text: this product is basically fly tape in a box.  it doesnt get rid of the eggs....you have to find those yourself.  i basically wound up throwing all my boxed food away until all the moths were gone.  and then the new batch hatched from their secret hiding place!  if you want to get rid of the moths, this definitely will catch them. the whole sticky area was covered with moths within a month

review/summary: Works! (Well...)
review/text: It took a few days to begin to trap pantry moths with these, but they've worked beautifully. I'm ordering them again!<br /><br />Update: I have bought Safer traps in the past, and have been pleased with the results, however this time (September 2009), the glue was so unsticky that a moth trapped inside the trap, with my hands covering the ends, merely walked on the glued surface and flew away. I am most disappointed, as I have a serious need for some good traps, and I was so looking forward to these traps.<br />So, I'm wondering about buying fly paper (that super gross stuff!) and sticking it inside the traps in an effort to use the lure (if that even works).<br />I suppose that the reduced glue may be due to trying to cut costs in manufacturing. In any case, I regret that I can no longer recommend buying Safer moth traps.

review/summary: Long Term Solution
review/text: If you have moths/grubs infesting your flour and grain products, this product is part of a long-term solution.  Yes, you have to clean out your cabinets, eliminate contaminated products, etc.  But then pop these simple sex pheromone traps into the cabinets.  They are useful both to trap moths looking to mate and lay eggs in your flour, and also to keep track of whether you still have moths, how many, and where. Knowing this, you can search more diligently for contaminated products to attack. You know that you are winning when you check the moths stuck in the trap and there are NO MORE MOTHS with wiggling antennae!

review/text: We bought it to get rid our house of the Indian Meal Moth. These insects are pretty harmless but annoying and would turn up in flour/cereals etc. After setting up the trap, nothing happened for like 2-3 days and we would manually swat the moths. Later it managed to catch 15-20 of these. But it would not attract all of them. We still had to go after them with brooms etc.

review/summary: Pantry pest traps.
review/text: Safer: Pantry Pest Trap (2 per box)  I have used this product many times over at least ten years.  The most recent order was through Amazon, and the traps have proved to be mildly effective in attracting the moths.  This is possibily due to the age of the traps.  The little pheremone insert might be waning in its effectiveness over time.  So, I think it is important that the traps be fresh, not from long stored supplies.<br /><br />I was dissatisfied with these traps, as very few moths have been trapped, compared to MANY in the past.  Compared to past traps, these rate about a 2 on a scale of 1-5.  Not good.

review/text: I had a terrible pantry moth problem a few months back and along with putting EVERYTHING in air tight containers/bags and trashing every open bag of rice/flour/cereal/whatever these were AMAZING. They each probably caught 50+ months in each and worked fabulously.<br /><br />If you are the type that doesn't like watching insects struggle in a glue trap, do not buy this, or if you do put it in an easily accessible place for the moths to get to that you do not have to look into because it isn't pretty. But the bottom line is this works PERFECTLY. If I ever see moths again I will buy this product time and time again. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

review/summary: Wasn't immediately effective, but one day...wow!
review/text: In April, at the height of our moth activity, I bought a box of these traps and placed one, per the instructions, underneath the cupboard. Three days later, all I'd found inside was a gray smudge where a moth apparently managed to free itself from the glue. I was frustrated and posted a 1-star review.<br /><br />Just over a month later I happened to look inside the trap, and I was stunned. Both sticky surfaces are now covered with moths and even a few flies. I haven't touched the trap, and I'm not sure what happened, but I've completely revised my opinion. You may now consider me very pleased with my purchase.

review/summary: Design Flaw or Launch Failure?
review/text: I must preface my review with the point that I'm not sure if these were out of date; I do not have the best of faith in the seller from whom I bought them. If they were not extremely old, however, I would say they are not very powerful or effective. When I have purchased other moth traps (I have tried four different brands) the pheromone pads always have a distinct odor immediately upon opening the packet of the most effective ones. These exuded no smell whatsoever. Also, the better ones begin catching moths immediately. A moth circled the vicinity of this trap for a good hour without feeling enticed enough to go inside. The next day, not one moth is in the trap. Finally, the sticky surface inside the trap is not the stickiest I've seen and does not cover the entire inside of the trap. Definitely would not recommend.

The production rate may be attributed to position but they are only 12 ft apart.

Peppermint oil... nope... bug spray... nope... bay leaves... nope...soap and water... nope... thowing everything away and storing everything in glass sealed jars... nope... freezing everything that comes into this house... nope.<br /><br />So I found these stupid little traps. So I buy them... follow the directions... and put it in my cabinet. The pantry moths would fly all around the trap... like they were really excited... Eager to get rid of these little buggars I sat and watched the trap... One flew in... landed on the sticky tape... fluttered around a little bit and was gone. He never stuck. So I checked the trap and stuck my finger on the glue it was sticky alright. So I thought maybe he just got lucky. So I watched the next one... he did the same thing!!!! I was LIVID!!! How in the world am I going to get rid of these things? So I figured... just leave the trap up and see what happends. 3 weeks later (they say replace every 3 weeks) I checked the trap.... NOT ONE MOTH WAS ON IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What the heck???!!!! There where a bunch of black / brown marks on the tape... but not one moth. BOTTOM LINE: DONT BUY THIS IT DOESNT WORK!!! If anyone has any advise... I would love some!!!

review/text: We had been plagued with pantry moths for MONTHS, and were getting at our wits ends.  They were everywhere!  I checked every food item we had and threw some away, cleaned the cupboards, but nothing I did even put a dent in the amount of moths we had.  When I found some information online about these pantry moth traps, I then came here to Amazon to read the reviews.  I was torn after reading that the newer versions were said to not work, but I was also desperate.  When I received this, I set up one of the traps in our kitchen on top of one of the hanging cabinets, and was amazed that in only about a week, our problem was solved!  I wish I would have tried this at the beginning and saved us a LOT of stress.  I would HIGHLY recommend these traps to anyone... they work!

review/text: Yes, the moth pheromone wafers are very effective at attracting moths.  No, the traps are not very good at catching them.  I have tried these, and many similar brands, all with the same problem.  Here's what you do:  Buy the pest trap.  Take out the pheromone wafer and throw away the rest.  Buy a fly paper ribbon (maybe fifty cents) and hang it up.  Stick the two pheromone wafers on the fly ribbon, about a foot apart.  This will catch meal moths for weeks, and will stay sticky even with dozens of moths on it.

review/text: If your pantry is inundated with moths (or weevil-types) - this trap will take care of the moths that hatch after you clean out your pantry. With the long life cycle that these pests have - you need something to catch new ones. Even if you clean out your food and put everything kept in storage containers there may still be some rogue eggs (you would be amazed at what these pests like to lay their eggs in!) I found eggs in clean brown lunch sacks. It wouldn't even be unreasonable to use these traps before you have a pest problem. Very safe!

review/summary: No longer works with new bait  enclosed
review/text: The trap worked well when  it came with a square bait package that was fit into the back slot. The bait was changed to a square pink  piece that sticks to the inside of the trap<br /><br /> It is compltely ineffective. Moths fly all aroound the pantry. infest boxes of food, and never go near the trap. If you trap a moth in there yourself, it doesnt stick to the glue,  and flies right back out.<br /><br />I have made this known to the Safer mfg. co. as soon as they changed the bait but they have done nothing.We have wasted about $100 on these traps in the past year. Have found nothing to replace it since other companies are using the same kind of bait.

review/summary: Great product, packaging can be improved
review/text: No question, this is an effective product. Using pheramones [sic.] to attact moths then trap them with sticky paper appeal to my love of science and technology.<br /><br />Today, the product is already folded into a triangular house for the moths to fly into. The interior is coated with adhesive so the moths become trapped after entering the house. Users must removed a pheramone-infused tab from a sealed package, then insert the tab into a slot to get it inside the housing. But almost always, the tab falls out of its intended spot and is stuck to the interior. I've used it this way and it seems to work fine, but the manufactuer can help users by making three changes in the way they package the product.<br /><br />1. make the little pheramone-infused tab already correctly  positioned and attached to the interior so that users don't have to open the sealed package and handle the tab.<br /><br />2. They should cover the whole item, including the sticky paper, with wax paper, score where the folds go, and indicate how to fold it into the housing shape. Then users would just have to peel the whole wax sheet off to expose the sticky paper and the pheramone tab, fold it up, and voila, done!<br /><br />This way, the manufacturer can also save on packaging by shipping the items in a flat envelope rather than a mostly empty box.<br /><br />3. Make the sticky housing attachable to something so it doesn't knock around my pantry.  This can be as simple as a hole to hang it on a nail, or a weak adhesive like that used on Post-it notes to attach the trap to a wall.

review/summary: Solving the Moth Problem
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJ7AIY">Woodstream 05140 Safer Pantry Pest Trap (2 per box)</a><br /><br />I have had great results with this product.  Those who say they work for a while and then quit need to remember that the traps are only meant to catch flying stages of the insect.  I use these traps once or twice a year, whenever I see a moth or two, once the infestation problem has been solved.<br /><br />1) Use Pantry Pest Traps to eliminate all ADULT moths.<br /><br />2) Next, go on a larva hunt (in the early stages they look like caraway seeds -- dark little crescent shapes about 1/8" long).  Check all the food in your cabinets.  Take it all out.  Anything can house larva. Look in the flour, cereals, boxes, bags, anything with a seam or crevice.  Think like a mother -- she is trying to hide her young so that they will survive!<br /><br />3) We have a pantry cabinet with adjustable shelves.  When moths kept coming back, I got a flashlight and discovered that there was larva in every single hole for the shelf brackets.  Swabbing the holes with a cotton swab dipped in alcohol produced mixed results, so I finally placed a piece of tape over each hole.  If the larva survived the alcohol, they starved to death in their little cell.<br /><br />Using this method, I buy traps when moths come in with the groceries.  I use canvas shopping bags that I wash every now and then so that the bags from the store (especially paper bags) don't bring in larva.

review/summary: THIS NO LONGER WORKS LIKE IT USED TO!!!!!
review/text: I have been buying the Pantry Pest Trap for years, and they used to work very well, effectively luring moths with the provided lure and trapping them in liberally applied sticky adhesive that coated the entire surface of the inside of a well designed cardboard trap. The lure used to fit into a slot on the back of the trap, and the edges of the trap bent upward and in, to make it harder for moths to get back out. Well, a couple years ago they changed the lure to a little piece of pink rubber or plastic that you just dropped onto the sticky area. I immediately noticed that the lure wasn't NEARLY as effective as the old one was. Additionally, edges no longer bent upwards, and the sticky area inside the trap had shrunk significantly, so moths could escape more easily. I just bought a box a week ago, and I never will again.  While they have kept the box the same size, they have shrunk the sticky portion to such a small area, these things aren't going to catch much of anything. Of course, I guess that may be the point - since these won't hold many moths anymore, you'll have to replace them more often.  I'll be looking for an alternative, because they aren't worth wasting anymore money on.

review/text: For some reason [unknown to me] I find these traps to be more effective when the pantry door is closed.  Maybe the natural air circulation in an open room dilutes the pheromone scent.  Anyway these traps have been VERY effective at stopping several infestations within a week.  I now keep a couple on hand and bring them out when I see moths flying about.  The package says they should be replaced every three months.

review/text: This pest trap is working pretty well for me.  I've had moths for a few years now.  They seem to come out mostly on summer nights.  I threw out almost all my food last year, yet they continue to show up.  I finally got sick of spending every evening swatting 5-7 moths.  Now with the trap, I only have to chase down 1-2 moths each night, if any.  I've found that location really does matter though.  One trap I placed on a bookshelf and caught nothing after several weeks.  I moved it just 5 feet away to another shelf, and now it's catching plenty of bugs.  So if you aren't getting as many bugs caught as you would expect, try moving the trap.  Anyway, this product isn't solving my pest issue, as I still have some floating around, but it's certainly helping a great deal.

review/summary: The dang thing really works!
review/text: Well truth be known, this product lives up to it's claim. The pantry pests are indeed pretty much gone. Yes there are still some the linger, but it culls them enough so they cannot get a stronghold on your pantry. The trap uses a pheromone to draw in the insects, it then uses a sticky pad to catch them. All that matters is that is works. You will usually see the moths on the paper in the first day. The benefits to this type of pest control are obvious. No mess, no stinky odors, and it's safe for the environment and your family.<br /><br /> Looking back, I would sure love to know how the critters got there in the first place? I can say this much, once they move in it's tough to get rid of them! I have a gut feeling I know where they came from, but cant prove it. If ever your in a supermarket and they have flour products reduced in price, think twice before buying. There might be a reason why they are cheap. Enough said.

I would rather have a few moths than risking the safety of my food using various pesticides.<br />One goes atop the fridge, and another atop the microwave sitting on it's cart.  As the trap fills up, effectiveness decreases because the sticky surface gets covered in moths and 'moth dust'.  I intend to spread some "tree tanglefoot" on top of the moths-  might extend the life.<br />Overall, an effective product for those moths listed on the box.  If this doesn't work for you, do a bit of research to identify your 'guests"!

review/summary: Ineffective
review/text: Want to add my voice to the negative reviews here. My family brought home some moths in store-brand brown rice and have been battling a minor infestation ever since. Minor in that we've kept them down to only one or two living moths visible at any given time; less minor in that the larvae get into /everything/ before we find them.<br />Before Safer, I had used another brand, which was reasonably effective, catching several moths in a two-week period. When I returned to the hardware store for another box, they were all out, but had LOTS of Safer brand traps. Now I know why.<br />The sticky patches are small and not very sticky. I'd take the trap down and see black smudges on the stickum that said a moth had landed on it and then flown away again. In a couple of weeks it had caught one moth, and there were obviously others flying around elsewhere.<br />I returned to the hardware store for another package of the first brand (I am not remembering the name) and informed the manager of the store that this worked very badly. I hope he will watch out for his business and cease to stock these money-wasters. Sadly, they seem to be the only brand stocked in most places.

review/text: We used Pantry Pest for several years and it used to do a good job of controlling the occasional infestations of flour moths, but they've changed the design of both the box and lure and now they're crap.  The adhesive, while nice and sticky, has been shrunk to two tiny patches and the lure is a thin rubber square that you toss onto the adhesive instead of the former round packet.  The moths don't seem too impressed with the little square and neither are we. I'm trying other brands now, the Springstar one has generous adhesive and a square that seems to actually work for instance, Catchmaster is next. No more Pantry Pest for our house!

review/summary: effective and safe moth traps
review/text: This is the third set of this brand pantry moth trap I've purchased.  It's virtually impossible to permanently rid your pantry of moth eggs once you have a moth.  They come in cycles for us.  The traps attract and catch all the adults.  They hatch in cycles, months apart.  The traps will sit empty for a long time, then suddenly I'll find 8 moths in one.  We keep as much food as possible in tightly sealed containers, but always have open cereals and cracker boxes on hand.  Since we started using the traps I've never found moths in the food or flying around.  They just show up in the traps.  You are supposed to replace the traps every three months, but ours have been working for longer periods - probably 5 months.

I knew they probably were "dead" and should be replaced, but just never got around to it. About a month ago, I found the trap and looked inside - inside three months (when I last checked), the trap went from no moths to a dozen or more captured!  And this is after years of just sitting with the phermone strip exposed to the air!  THANK YOU, SAFER!  I immediately replaced the traps with new ones, since the old ones were full.  Hope the new traps last 1/2 as long!  RECOMMENDED.

review/summary: Is working for me
review/text: Purchased my traps at Lowes and the moths flocked to them.  After a month or two I couldn't tell if the traps were still working - they had collected many moths!  So I moved the old traps to a different closet and added two more traps to the pantry.  all four traps are still catching moths!<br /><br />So, the traps (a) lure the moths and trap them, but (b) I'm still having moths show up over three months later.  I suspect the moths have dug in quite well, but I'll continue adding traps until they come up clean.<br /><br />I realize that some reviewers say the traps don't work...I wonder if they opened the small envelope (~1"x1") that contained the pheromone chip, and placed (dropped) the chip onto the sticky board as the instructions directed.  That chip is what draws the males to the sticky board.  Without the pheromone chip, the trap will be ineffective.<br /><br />When I first opened the trap I found the instructions to be not as clear as I thought they should have been - I wasn't certain how the pheromone chip was to be placed in the trap.  It turns out that you just open the envelope (pouch?) and drop the chip onto the sticky board on the inside of the trap.  then place the trap in the location where you believe the moths reside.  The trap does the rest - safely.<br /><br />I'm satisfied with the operation of the trap, but ready for the moths to be eradicated.  At least they are no longer flying around my kitchen!

He didn't get loose the second time. There's an allegorical tale for all us males right there.<br /><br />As has been mentioned in other reviews, these only trap the male moths. That cuts down on the reproduction rate but you still have to kill the females by hand. The traps might work better if the manufacturer had put a larger patch of the sticky stuff on the inside and the price is a little high but when used in conjunction with proper storage techniques, the traps will help you keep grain moths under control.

review/summary: Pantry Pest Trap: it works and is easy to use
review/text: Those little white "flour moths" which appear in your pantry usually come with contaminated products (not unusually dry dog food, but lots of others, too). Besides the arduous task of cleaning everything to be rid of them, the best deterrent/eradicator I know of is this Pantry Pest Trap, a pheromone-based item which traps the males so they cannot mate, ending the breeding cycle.<br /><br />This brand works, and all you have to do is switch out for a new trap every three months and they generally stay away.

review/summary: Really worked
review/text: We returned from a month's vacation to find moths flying freely in our kitchen and cupboards.  I have used Pantry Pest in the past and found that Amazon offered them for about $2.00 less per package.  After cleaning out my cupboards and tossing anything that I found with signs of moths, I placed 4 traps in my various cupboards.  Within a week, all of the moths were gone.  Now, 3 weeks later, I remain moth free.

review/text: Worked great at first.  After we put out the second trap with a fresh lure, many fewer moths were caught (even though we still had quite a few) and we often saw moths sitting near the trap, but not going in for the bait.  Maybe they evolve and we were selecting those who were less attracted to the scent of the lure.

review/summary: Sticky trap with Pheromone bait attracts MALE moths, breaking life cycle!
review/text: Based on my multiple experiences, I recommend:<br /><br />1. Buy extra Pantry Pest Traps! $ave at Home Depot!<br /><br />2. Use traps when FIRST seeing evidence of moths.<br /><br />3. Cluster multiple traps (2-4) on top of the fridge.<br /><br />Can this product be improved? Yes! Make a larger sticky surface to trap moths. Most of, but not all of the inside surface of the trap is sticky. To help, I suggest...<br /><br />4. Buy a package of fly paper ribbon/strips and temporarily mount 1 from the ceiling close to the Safer Pantry Pest Traps to trap more bugs.<br /><br />Unrelated to the product, due to re-infestations, I now additionally do the following:<br /><br />Toss ALL baking mix, flour, rice, cereal, macaroni, ramen, noodles, mac-n-cheese mix, pizza mix, gravies, chili mix, spice mix, etc. into garbage bags, seal and immediately put into an outside trash can.<br /><br />Thoroughly and carefully clean out/vacuum all cabinets/drawers paying special attention to crevices and all surfaces. I carefully clean product containers returned to the cabinet/drawers. It only takes 2 moths/larvae/eggs to re-infest.<br /><br />I stopped buying food in bulk, and I end up with fresher products and less cluttered cabinets and drawers.<br /><br />I now store susceptible foods in glass containers with screw-on lids, it's a lot easier to see a moth that way, and a good way to recycle glass.<br /><br />NOTE: The Pantry Pest Trap is also sold under other names. I will certainly buy this product again and I keep at least 1 box of unopened traps in my cupboard just waiting for the buggers!

review/text: I have never given a 1 star before but after 2 weeks these are useless.Last year I bought catch masters on Amazon and they worked fine. I bought these at Home Depot and they worked for about 2 weeks. Today I noticed moths walking on the "glued surface" with no sticking at all. Caught maybe 8 moths before losing stickiness. Am going to buy the catch masters again and throw these away. Someone suggested buying fly paper and putting the trap on that.

review/summary: Ineffective
review/text: I have used traps of this kind before with perfect success.  I found out about this kind of trap when a few years ago, an exterminator came to the apartment I was living in at the time and left a different brand of the same style, and it did the trick.  All of the moths were gone within a few weeks.  So later on in a different apartment I bought this kind of trap, and again they worked.  From my previous experience, I know it can take a little bit of time before the moths begin to find the traps, and then they would flock to them until they were all gone.  I have now bought two boxes of Safer traps, and all of them have been sitting around different areas of my home for nearly a month, and the moths are still all around, minding their own business, completely uninterested, and I am sure the continue mating and expanding their numbers.  I'm definitely not happy about that.  Did something change about this product, or had I bought a different brand the last time?  Couldn't possibly recommend this brand given my recent experience.

review/summary: It works
review/text: Pantry moths are just gross.  So when I Googled it & realized why I had so many moths in my house, I quickly got onto Amazon to find the right product - one that didn't use harsh chemicals & one that was effective.  The minute (literally) I opened the pheromone packet and placed it in the trap, I had 4 moths fly in from who knows where attracted to the trap. [I have video proof -- I'll try to upload].  One got interested enough and was caught on the sticky trap immediately.  Unfortunately, the other 3 just kinda hung out but never entered the trap.  And I didn't catch any more for a couple days.  Just as I was feeling disappointed by it's lack of victims, after being away from the house for a couple days, I came home to 3-4 more moths captured.  [Hooray!]<br /><br />Overall, it works but not as aggressively as I hoped.  But I'm not sure another trap would.  I'm happy with my purchase because it is capturing the moths and my problem does seem to be reduced (I only see about 1-2 moths a day...  I still have to majorly clean out my cupboards before I expect any full reprieve).  I might try a stickier fly strip as suggested by some - I have not seen that the tackiness doesn't work, but I'm willing to try anything to make sure all the moths are gone.

review/summary: there are better traps available
review/text: They work but the sticky area is about half of the size of the trap. You also must put their " lure " on this sticky area so unlike other brands that come with the chemical already in the sticky part you can not cut the trap into a few smaller traps and put into a few places. I found Pro-Pest brand better because all the inside surface is coated and treated and because of that has twice the moth catching and holding capacity. You can cut this brand into two or three  smaller traps and place in a number of locations. I have done this and it seems to work just fine. That can save you some money.

review/summary: Amazing stuff
review/text: These work really well. I have a problem with pantry moths, and thought I had almost gotten rid of them, but got the traps just in case. When I first opened the shipping box in my kitchen, a small fleet of moths seemingly came out of nowhere and starting swarming the box. So, I'd say that this is pretty potent love stuff for them! The downside of course is having the traps laying around with dead moths (or struggling moribund moths) stuck to them.  And, despite using the traps for 6 months, and putting all newly purchased grains in the freezer for 24 hrs, new moths are stilling appearing now and then, so full eradication remains elusive.

review/text: These traps were the only thing I found that cured my pantry moth problem -- I cleaned out my pantry, disposed lots of dry goods, and tried to keep everything tightly sealed but still have problems with the moths.  After a few weeks with these, the moths were gone.  I've used them for about three years now and haven't seen any moths or their eggs anywhere.<br /><br />You've got to be patient.  I was expecting that the moths would fly right in to the traps to meet their demise.  It doesn't exactly work that way -- but with time, the moths do find their way into the traps and the problem is solved.<br /><br />Overall, a great, simple solution to a very annoying and costly problem.

review/summary: Not the best trap around.
review/text: This company made some very interesting choices. They put the pheromone bait in a special tiny square of plastic that you have to drop onto the actual sticky surface. What this causes is a mass buildup of moths in that one tiny area of the sticky trap, and no moths anywhere else. Also, the sticky surface of the trap is quite small and doesn't utilize all of the cardboard of the trap. What sticky surface there is is not that sticky at all, actually. I've seen moths fly in, land, get scared, and fly out.<br /><br />There are better pheromone moth traps, like the Pro Pest Pheronet. This one just doesn't cut it.

review/text: A roommate and I moved into an apartment with a serious moth problem and took almost a year to get it completely fixed. I can sympathize with anyone in a similar situation!<br /><br />This product essentially does what it says (at least for us, I think we had grain moths). It would lure-in and catch 10-20 moths and day and within a week, would be at capacity with no more sticky surface left! It's great that package 2 traps in each box! The REAL solution to a moth problem is:<br /><br />1) Place all grains in anything less than sealed glass or metal containers in the freezer for a week. Put almost anything you can in there for good measure. Try to use heavy-duty containers in the future too...<br />2) Place tape over any cracks in the walls or between cabinates and the walls. I think they were nesting in there...<br />3) Clean all surfaces carefully and throw out any food older than a week or two. My roommate brought a paper-bag filled with corn flour.... They got into it at some point and by the next time we checked it was filled with silk - yuck.<br />4) Use these traps to catch the stragglers. They won't fix the problem alone.<br />5) Be diligent in killing them yourself. I killed many-a-moth by hand..<br /><br />These traps are great, but no more than a band-aid if used alone! Find the source of the problem!

review/text: I've used these before and was very happy with its performance.  But with my latest purchase, I was surprised to see the sticky area covers only 50% of the trap size. This  smaller sticky catch area means you have to buy this brand more often.  I looked at my old traps and most of the trap is sticky, and covered in moths, but they are not Safer brand traps.  They work just fine, so I say Safer is not a good deal for the price.

review/summary: Did not work.
review/text: I bought some bird food that was infested with moth eggs.  By the time I found out, my house was full of pantry moths.  Tried vacuuming, cleaning, swatting, and spraying, but the little guys just kept multiplying.  I saw these moth traps at Home Depot after I had ordered another brand on Amazon.  I picked up two traps at Home Depot.  The next day, I also received the other brand from Amazon.  The Safer brand caught 4 moths in an entire day.  Since that time, all 4 moths have gotten loose and went on the prowel.  The sticky pad does not work.  The other brand I bought is full of moths.  The moths just swarmed to it immediately.  The moths flew around the Safer moth trap, but very few of them actually entered the trap.  It is designed just like the other brands, so it puzzles me why the moths will not enter the trap.  I set the Safer and Biocare moth traps in the same room.  The biocare worked so well that I have to order more to replace the two that are completely full of moths.  In the meantime, I will leave the Safer moth traps in place just to see if they will catch any moths with the other traps removed.  So far, after a few hours, the traps have not caught one moth.<br /><br />I seen the good an the bad reviews on this brand.  Thought I would try it.  Evidently, it is a quality control issue since some people have good results, and others; like me, have had no results whatsoever.

review/text: The Safer brand pantry moth traps are amongst the best.  They are odorless and effective.  Unlike other brands of similar traps, the Safer brand has the lure pads individually packaged so you can only use one trap if that is your need.<br /><br />Although the packaging suggests several weeks between trap replacement, the lure seems much less effective after 3 or 4 weeks.

review/summary: Safer Pantry Pest Trap
review/text: I was unimpressed by this product.  When I put this product out on my counter, the moths looked a little dazed and confused.  Most flew near the trap, but less than 10 percent got inside the trap, near the sticky part.  The rest just kept flying around the kitchen.  I also tried placing the trap inside the cabinet (with everything removed) with similar results.  I would find moths within inches of the trap, but none inside.

review/summary: rubbish, don't waste your money!
review/text: So disappointed, it read so well, but its been sitting there for over a week now and my abundant moth population are completely ignoring it....Indeed they are having a party less than a metre from the trap as if to tease me.... I've resorted to hoovering them up daily.... don't waste your money!!!

review/summary: Glue doesn't hold
review/text: I purchased these at a local hardware store. The lure works, but the glue doesn't hold the moths.<br /><br />1) Upon opening the box, I discovered the traps are already pre-folded for use. The glue is exposed to the air with no plastic protective covering. This is different from every other trap I've used. All 3 boxes were like this, so it appears to be the norm for this brand.<br /><br />2) There are two lures included and they are packaged individually. That's great if you don't want to use both traps at once. Most brands package them together.<br /><br />I noticed that approximately 15 moths were flying around the trap within the first 5 minutes. They were clearly very attracted to the lure. But, two days later, only 1 moth was caught. The glue sides were covered in moth dust, which I assume is from the glue escapees.<br /><br />It wasn't a total waste. I used the lures in separate bottle type trap, which worked great.

review/summary: Absolute waste of money
review/text: Literally does nothing but take up space. Bugs walk around and are not even remotely interested in stopping in. I'm not sure if the "lure" even works. I also don't see how they would actually stick to the box...doesn't seem sticky enough.

review/summary: moth free
review/text: I have found 'The Pantry Pest Trap' to be the ultimate deterant to the moth pest. When The Pantry Pest Trap was no longer available at a local "box" store, I had a fit because the traps kept my pantry, garage and closets free of moths. Fortunately, I searched the internet and found the "Safer" product available via Amazon.com.  So instead of chasing moths all through the house with a fly swatter, I use 'The Pantry Pest Trap' the best moth catcher ever available via Amazon.com. And, I approve this message...J R Johnson

review/summary: A+ for attractant, F- for killing power
review/text: The attractant part of this works almost instantly. Within seconds of opening the pouch the moths were swarming. The sticky inside the trap is 100% garbage! Not a single moth got stuck. I watched them get their wings and feet 'stuck' only to easily free themselves again. The sticky is covered in dusty wing prints, but there are none actually stuck. This product gets a 2 only because the attractant made it easier to squish all the moths.

review/summary: Not the best option, but a really good one...
review/text: I had a bag of dog food come into my house and it was contaminated with moths. We spent days killing them. Apparently we did not kill them fast enough because in a few more days we had the worms EVERYWHERE (there must have been 200 on the ceiling in the morning). A few more days pass and even though we thought we had all the worms we had moths everywhere again. I bought a couple of these traps and they worked well. I was rather impressed. We still have moths and we kill them as we see them, but the trap does catch them. A few days later I went to order more of these since I knew they worked and saw the catchmaster ones as well for a lot cheaper, so I ordered both. I am giving these 4 stars because they worked well and really impressed me, until I put out the catchmaster traps. In 2 days the catchmaster ones are outcatching these ones 4 to 1. They seem to use the same lure, but have MUCH stronger glue and a lot more of it. These work well, but you can get 3 times the traps for about the same money and the cheaper ones do a better job.<br /><br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051OJS1W">Catchmaster Moth and Pantry Pest Trap: Three Packs of Two</a>

review/summary: THE PANTRY PEST TRAP (Safer)
review/text: Like of nowhere, we suddenly had two or three moths in our pantry every morning. Hence, we set up the two Pantry Pest Traps directly inside the pantry and left the doors open for two days. Surprisingly, moths kept flying or resting under the shelves and not a single one was attracted to the lure. They totally ignored the traps and not a single one got caught. In my opinion a very bad investment at over $6 for two useless traps.

review/text: These have caught hundreds of moths in the past.  But the last ones are NO GOOD!  I have traps set out and the moths are flying around me!  These no longer work.  Don't buy these.

review/summary: Complete Garbage
review/text: Amazon should be ashamed of selling this and there are probably a whole bunch of people in China laughing at the people who buy this product. We bought these as a replacement for older moth traps that actually worked and I can't believe the difference. The attracter square is tiny and doesn't attach anywhere while the on-the-trap folding instructions tell you to put it in a non-existing place (I have an idea where they should put their traps), and the sticky trap material is again, virtually non-existent. Total crap. Buy these to send to someone you hate who has moths.

review/summary: Excellent moth trap!
review/text: We have unfortunately had a real problem with these food moths and found that these Pantry Pest Traps to be EXCELLENT in catching them. I truly do not understand the negative reviews, other than perhaps these customers do not have 'food' moths but 'clothes' moths. I mean who ever thought researching 'moths' would ever be on one's agenda list??? Anyway, suffice it to say, that these moth traps are highly effective and the Amazon price is the lowest around. Thank you both Pantry Pest and Amazon for being the amazing company that you are!

review/summary: They really work
review/text: I had an infestation of grain moths shortly after moving into a home - these traps really worked.  Best if kept somewhat away from the food area.  Recently I must have purchased something that brought them back.  I have caught a lot of moths so far and gotten the population down.  Think more hatch so it will be a while.
