review/summary: Traaza Ghee
review/text: Taaza Ghee is very good and it's quite nutritious for just about anyone.  Ghee is simply butter from which the milk solids have been boiled out.  The remaining is near pure oil so it is O.K. for those who have milk intolerance. It is superb as a cooking oil - doesn't smoke like butter and some other oils. Also, ghee can be stored at room temperature, best away from light.<br /><br />My complaint is the cost.  It is twice as expensive as butter. For those who need to stay away from milk (dairy) products and don't want to heat olive oils, etc., use of ghee may be worth the price.

Upon inspecting the other jars I found two additional jars with loose lids that had leaked as well.<br /><br />In all fairness, after I complained to Amazon; they immediately extended a refund and sincere apology.

review/summary: Not your average tea - even non tea drinkers can enjoy!
review/text: I am a fair weather tea drinker & I can only palate most teas with a lot of sugar.  This tea is the ONE exception.  I first drank this years ago in a Good Earth restaurant (the first really healthy restaurant) & I was hooked immediately!  I have never since found a tea that was even close to this.  Most teas have a leafy, stick taste that screams to be covered up with sugar.  This tea stands alone, no sugar, no cream - nothing but incredible full flavor.  It is not much like typical tea but rather almost a cider instead (minus the apple juice).  It has the most wonderful cinnamony flavor that is warming & relaxing.  I have even made it cold & it is good, but so different from the usual ice tea.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anybody who is looking to enjoy tea but who doesn't like the leafy flavors of typical tea, try this one!

review/summary: Sweet and tangy
review/text: I love this tea. The Good Earth tea bags result in a slightly tangy, sweet tea without needing to use sugar. I will frequently have several cups of this tea in the winter and in the summer it makes a good iced tea. I have several friends who have diabetes and they have all really liked it when I serve it. Unlike a lot of other herbal teas, this tea is based on spices rather than on rose hips which tend to upset my stomach. I highly reccommend this tea to anyone that likes herbal teas and likes to watch their sugar intake. The caffinated Good Earth original tea is also very good, giving you a caffine hit and a slightly sweetened tea without using sugar. Both teas have a very pleasant taste without being overwhelming. The Good Earth original tea reminds me a bit of the really great Seattle Spice Market tea.

I looked at the ingredients several times, there are no artifical flavors, so not sure what the other reviews are taking about.  I really really enjoy this tea, and I use a natural sweetener, Stevia to sweeten. I normally do not like the Stevia due to a bit of an aftertaste, but in this tea, it works excellent.  Such a wonderful cup of tea, and I am picky about my teas.

I let it steep a bit on the longer side, and can usually re-use the bag once (or even better, take 2 tea bags I have used once and make a cup with the two bags together). If I could, I'd toss you a bag of it to try. :)

He's always amazed that the caffeine free version of this tea has no actual tea in it but tastes the same as the regular Good Earth tea. My only disappointment was that when this arrived at our house, it came in a box that said Good Earth ALL OVER IT! It ruined the surprise of his Christmas present but not his enjoyment of the tea I suppose!

review/summary: The Best Tea, Hot or Cold!
review/text: Love this tea, either hot or cold!  As a hot tea, it is wonderfully fragrant and delicious.  I used to drink it in the office of my workplace, and folks made favorable comments about the aroma.  As a summer ice tea, it is delicious, a nice blend of natural sweetness, and it's caffeine free.

review/text: I have drank this tea for years. It smells great, it tastes great and the caffeine free tea is wonderful in the evenings when it is cold outside. Each tea bag comes with its own little sayings on it so each time you have tea you get something to read. Just to let first time buyers know do not let your bag sit in your water for very long as it tends to get a bitter taste. Just dip tea bag till color changes about 20-30 seconds and remove.

review/text: This is a very tasty tea for the winter.  But, if you let it steep to long it can get so sweet it will make your teeth hurt.  The list of ingredients listed in Amazon's blurb seems improbable.  It has a strong, complex cinnamon flavor. I recommend this tea for those who like cinnamon teas and are disappointed by how thin some of them taste.

review/text: Bought this tea only to find out that the third ingredient is Artificial Flavor, even though the front of the box has the word "Natural" on it and the packaging certainly gives the appearance of a natural product.  I called Good Earth and spoke to the manager of consumer affairs to find out what chemical they were putting into the flaver.  Guess what.  That information is proprietary.  Guess the artifical chemicals they are pumping into their tea are bad enough that they won't even relase that information to their consumers.

review/text: Caution, not all Good Earth Original Caffeine Free (or with caffeine) taste the same. This one for me is the best. I made the mistake and bought ALL NATURAL Good Earth Original and it has a weaker, less tangy taste. So now when I need to purchase more tea, I look for the same design on the box and even check the scan number 27018 30135. But the best way, is ordering on Amazon with the auto shipping every three months. This is the best tasting tea. If your a tea lover THIS IS WONDERFUL.

review/summary: Buyer Beware! Not 100% Natural Anymore. Artificial Flavor instead of Natural Flavor
review/text: I purchased the 6 pack of Good Earth Caffeine Free Sweet and Spicy. I was shocked when I compared the ingredients on the boxes I received to the ingredients listed on the Amazon website. Website states "100% Natural...No artificial Flavors". On the website, "Natural Flavor" is the third ingredient. On the boxes I received "Artificial Flavor" is the third ingredient!<br />Good Earth was recently purchased by the Tata Beverage Group. Apparently they have chosen to enhance their profit on what used to be a quality, 100% Natural product by using inferior ingredients. I'm sure as educated consumers become aware of this change, this item will rapidly drop from it's #2 selling position at Amazon. As always, Amazon's customer service<br />was excellent. They refunded my total purchase price for the item. Guess I'll donate the product to a local food bank.

review/summary: Natural OR Artificial Flavor, your choice
review/text: So, there is a bit of confusion here about the ingredients in this product. Upon speaking with The Good Earth directly, I have learned that the 18-count Original Sweet & Spicy Tea (both caffeine-free and regular) have artificial flavor, whereas the 25-count boxes do not. It seems like a stupid way to differentiate, since the boxes look exactly the same, with the same exact name. I think they do this so as not to highlight the fact that any of their products have artificial flavoring. I learned from them that they originally had artificial flavor in the blend, then removed it, and received complaints because it tasted different (though probably only slightly). They then added it back to their formula, but only in the 18-count boxes. It is a "spice flavor not found in nature," they claim, so I guess there's no other way to please the people who like that flavor. The first box I got was from an outlet grocery store that was produced during the in-between period when the artificial flavor had been removed from all boxes. It was really good just like that; I still enjoyed the flavor of the new version (technically the old version) that I received from Amazon, but actually not quite as much, and I'd rather have the natural version since it's natural and I like that one anyway.<br /><br /> As a note about the flavor--I really like this tea. It is, as described, sweet and spicy. It has a very cinnamon-y flavor with a lot of dimension added by all the other flavors included. I drink a few cups a day, either caffeinated or the rooibos version, depending on time of day. The flavor between these two are slightly different, but comparable. I love the fact that it is delicious without sugar and/or milk (though also delicious with either or both as well)--this is coming from someone with a serious sweet tooth. So that helps a lot, but apparently it has 3 calories per serving.<br /><br />If you like this, you may also enjoy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63LDS">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea, Bengal Spice, 20-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a>--another spicy herbal tisane that I like without sugar.

review/summary: The best sun tea .... ever
review/text: During the summer months, I enjoy iced tea and prefer to make sun tea because it's so darn simple & energy-efficient. But finding tea that does well in the sun is difficult. The regular teas (black, green, white) become bitter when left standing too long, not surprisingly a requirement for sun tea. The herbals (fruits, chamomiles, mints) never seem to steep well in the sun and are generally bland & lack-luster. But this tea ... ah, heaven. Deep, robust, sweet, well-rounded. Personally, I think it is better as a sun tea than steeped the traditional way with hot water.<br /><br />This tea steeps well in morning or afternoon sun. I always use glass (never plastic) and 6 bags for about 1.5 quarts. Makes a fantastic tea in 3-4 hours, and letting it sit for a couple more hours produces a tea that definitely needs to be watered down. Needs no sugar, no lemon. Perfect as is. Awesome, just awesome. I wouldn't go a summer without it.<br /><br />I pick it up at Trader Joe's, and occassionally I find it at Target and Wal-mart. Nevertheless, considering that shipping is included in a subscription, Amazon's S&S price is fair and on-par with B&M retail outlets.

review/summary: Used to be my favorite tea- NOT ANYMORE!
review/text: I only gave this tea a star because I couldn't post a review without at least one. It really rates ZERO stars.<br />I had loved Good Earth Original Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free Herbal tea from first sip, and it quickly became my favorite. When I was suddenly unable to find it locally, I was excited to find it on Amazon and ordered 6 boxes, with more to be sent automatically. Alas, the feeling was not to last. I was SO disappointed in the tea!<br />I happily made a cup as soon as it arrived, and something was off about the smell. Then I tasted it, and all doubt was gone- it was NOT the same tea. Reading the ingredients on the box, I discovered ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR as the 3RD INGREDIENT! UGH! No wonder it was so awful! YUCK! It was so bad, it bears repeating... YUCK! It actually gave me a headache (similar to MSG). Don't buy this tea if you liked the original. It is no longer "all natural"!<br />I emailed a polite inquiry to the tea company about the change in recipe, and still have gotten no response.<br /><br />Customer service at Amazon was wonderful, as always, and promptly issued me a full refund, and I donated the tea to a local charity.

review/text: This is a super sweet tea that tastes like you're sucking on a "red hot" candy. Because none of the ingredients listed on the box are themselves super sweet, my best guess is that the "artificial flavor"/AF listed on the box is Splenda.<br /><br />If the AF was Stevia, they wouldn't need an AF disclaimer because it is natural ingredient; if it contained the other two artificial sweeteners in the pink and blue packets, they would have to include a PKU disclaimer on the box, which they do not.

review/text: Has anyone else noticed that the flavor seems to have changed in recent batches of Good Earth Original? I find it much "twiggier" for lack of a better descriptor, and not NEARLY as sweet and good as it was before. I'm going to buy another box to make sure that this isn't totally random, but this was the case with two boxes I bought, one of Original and one of Original Decaf. Other friends of mine have noticed this as well; I really hope they didn't change the formula because it is/was my favorite tea and I don't like what I'm tasting now!

review/summary: The flavor has changed and no longer tastes good.
review/text: I have been drinking Good Earth Sweet & Spicy tea (herbal) for years. It has been my favorite herbal tea for as long as I can remember, and I traditionally have a cup after dinner. When Costco stopped carrying a few months ago, I turned to Amazon and got six boxes in one order. Big mistake. Since the manufacturer has changed hands and the box went from light brown to purple, the tea also got seriously degraded. The difference is astounding, as I still have old tea bags from the last manufacturer and was able to directly compare. There is a distant hint of the old flavor that I pine for each time I take a sip, but what I am mostly met with is a harsh and unappealing flavor, and the longer it brews it just gets grosser rather than sweeter and spicier. It's tough to explain in words this distinct difference in flavor but trust me, it's disappointing. It is no longer the Good Earth that we all know and love so much.

You think healthy good earth etc. I have been drinking this tea since the early 1980's. I had my first taste in the Good Earth Restaurant. Loved the ice tea version. I haven't had it for awhile and was excited to see it, got some and what a disappointment. A weird long after taste I never had before and a buzzy head. I sometimes will have reactions to chemicals or artifical ingredients. Unfortunately I won't be able to have anymore of this tea. Most likely others won't have the same reaction but who wants something with such deceptive marketing? I'll stick with other natural teas!

I contacted Good Earth because I was so upset at the change in their product.  They informed me that they make a version with artificial flavor and one without as well as organic.  The organic does not contain artificial flavor.  Since it seems to be a game of change as to whether you get artificial flavor or not when ordering this product.  If it is important to you that it be all natural, I recommend getting the organic variety.

review/summary: Sweet & Spicy: Natural & Artificial Flavor
review/text: For years I have been enjoying Good Earth Original Sweet & Spicy (natural flavor) tea but the last box had a different flavor, which I don't like. I wasn't aware that it was actually a different formula that has artificial flavor added. The two packages are almost identical in appearance. You have to read the fine print on the lower portion of the front of the package just below where it says "Herbal Tea Blend". One will say Natural and the other (as shown by Amazon here) will say Natural and Artificial Flavor.<br /><br />In talking with a representative at Good Earth, I have been informed that they still make Sweet & Spicy without the artificial flavor. I expressed my concern as to their lack of clear differentiation on packaging. Buyer beware!<br /><br />Update: I have since purchased some of the Natural (no artificial flavor) and found that it too was quite different than I had been used to. Not only was the flavor different but it was very weak compared to the old stuff, which I could easily get two cups out of. The new stuff tasted like it had already been used for two cups before it got to mine.

review/summary: All Sizes Now Have Artificial Flavor, Original Formula Retired
review/text: Good Earth made the very bad decision to alter their perfectly formulated Caffeine Free Original Sweet & Spicy Herbal Tea and the new formula is not even as good as the average Decaf Chai Black Tea from Celestial Seasonings. This used to be the best tea on the market for quality and flavor but is now not even in the top twenty. I can no longer recommend this product. I wrote to the company and received no response. The complaint is as follows.<br /><br />Dear Good Earth Representative, I am certain you have received hundreds of this precise complaint but I felt the need, after so many times checking back in stores and purchasing a box of your Original Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea only to find that the taste is well below the average taste of any cheap store brand chai, to ask that your company, please, reconsider the decision to switch to this newer formula/recipe for the Herbal Sweet and Spicy tea. It has been so long since I or anyone I know has had your wonderful tea because you replaced it, a year ago or more at this point, with a tea that no one, and I mean no one, that I know was willing to continue drinking. At least 8 women at work stopped drinking it right along with me and the reviews on Amazon of your new recipe are consistently terrible. I used to have great appreciation for your company and a great love for your product. If you wanted to offer a separate Ginseng-free formula, your company could have simply introduced a night-time ginseng-free herbal. The orgininal formula did not have to be retired in order to facilitate this change. Please pass this sentiment along to your superiors on behalf of myself and many of my relatives, coworkers and companions. None of us purchase your products anymore and we would come back to your company as loyal and daily drinkers of the old formula of the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Herbal Tea if you would only revive the old formula and resume manufacture and sale of this lost and missed product. Thank you for your time.

review/text: I am a big fan of Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Tea.  In July I ordered a pack of six 18-count boxes of caffeine free Sweet and Spicy tea bags.  I often give boxes as gifts.  The flavor of the tea from this order was not good.  Initially I thought maybe only one tea bag was bad, but each bag I tried had a bad taste.  I asked a friend to try one of the bags and she had the same reaction and said it did not taste like the Sweet and Spicy Tea she was accustomed to.  Perhaps this was a bad lot or the box is old.  However, the expiration date is 10-Mar-14.

review/summary: Digusting, couldn't even finish a cup
review/text: Like many others I have loved this tea for decades, both my husband and I would drink it everyday.  We used to get it from Costco and then no longer could. Found it at our local Sprouts, but in a new purple packaging.  Went home to enjoy a cup with my husband and he took one sip and put it down and refused to drink any more of it.  I tried to continue to drink it, but gave up on it after about a half a cup. It really tastes artificial with very little of the beloved cinnamon taste. I am not even going to dontate this to the food bank as it is garbage and so it is going into the garbage.  The packaging was very deceptive "New Look Same Great Taste".  Sadly, I no longer trust this company.

review/text: I've been using this tea for over a year. I don't know what happened but this last  order of six boxes is just awful. Did Good Earth change the formula? Don't know but I will not be ordering this again. They have ruined a formally wonderful product!! So disappointed! However, after notifying Amazon my full purchase price was refunded. Now that is what I call great customer service! Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Taste has changed
review/text: I have been getting the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine-Free tea for several months now on a subscription (pack of 6), and usually drink two to three tea bags a night. I don't know when they changed the tea to include 'Natural and Artificial' flavors, but the taste of the tea I got in July has totally changed for the worse, and I can't drink it! The only way I can describe the way it tastes is that it reminds me of burnt wiring. I opened up a second box (of the six) and tried one of tea bags in that box, and it's the same thing: it's undrinkable.<br /><br />I am really bummed out, because it was my favorite tea. Unfortunately, it can't be returned, so I've got boxes of the tea that I can't drink.<br /><br />I may try a box of the Organic Caffeine-Free version, but from the reviews it doesn't sound like it's got as much flavor as the Original blend.

review/summary: Used to be excellent, formula changed
review/text: This used to be my favorite tea, but the formula has changed.  I've heard that if you can find the tea in the original pale yellow box, that it is still the old (good tasting) formula.  Read through the other negative reviews and comments for more info (and notice the dates on the reviews, good and bad).  It used to taste like a liquid fireball candy, now it tastes like hot water with black pepper.

review/text: I LOVE...LOVED this tea, I have been drinking it for so long I am not sure when I started....but it is not the same, I had a stash downstairs and recently ran out. At the grocery I noticed the packaging had changed but I didn't think much of it.<br /><br />The tea just doesn't taste the same. I read other reviews and I don't know if the sweetener is the cause but its not the same. It does appear they may be putting less tea in the bags or again they have changed something. My cup of tea is no longer a dark, aromatic cup of joy, it is light brownish and the flavor is a hue of its former self. I sadly had to add black tea to my cup just to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I grudgingly broke out my last original tea bag and made it next to this "new" tea .... the difference is huge.<br /><br />If only I could get the original recipe, I'd make it at home!<br /><br />I wrote the company for what it is worth.

review/summary: More on "not natural"
review/text: I purchased organic Good Earth (at a "whole foods" type of store) but not in the packaging shown.  I was disappointed in the flavor because it just seemed as though it used to be so much immediately spicy and flavorful and sweet.  Then I saw this package in another store and purchased it.  When I tried it I found it was more like what I had been expecting.  I compared ingredients between the two boxes.  Lo and behold the tea in the package shown had "artificial flavor" as ingredient #3!!  Wow!  So that was the ingredient that made it so appealing.  I had never read the label on the old Good Earth that I was so "addicted" to!! Needless to say, I am just fine drinking the organic Good Earth with all natural ingredients.  So, guess that means I need to be a good label reader!

review/summary: Not the same Good Earth tea
review/text: The Good Earth Sweet and Spicy tea used to be my favorite tea- it was naturally sweet so I never had to add any sugar or honey. However, after receiving my current shipment of tea, I noticed that the taste was significantly different than the taste I was used to- the tea just didn't taste very good at all. I couldn't figure out why until I read some recent Amazon reviews mentioning that Good Earth was recently purchased by another company, which must be using inferior ingredients. Such a shame. I appreciate Amazon's great customer service- I received a full refund- but unfortunately had to cancel my subscribe and save subscription. I hope this inferior Good Earth tea will receive many complaints which will lead the new parent company to go back to the original ingredients for the tea.

I called Amazon and as always, they were wonderful about refunding my money. Then I called Good Earth and found out they changed the ingredients and some boxes are the old flavor and some are not. They said they now have 3 blends. Well, I can't begin to figure out which one I am getting so I am onto trying other types of tea! So it's been lovely but no more Good Earth tea for me!!

review/summary: Excellent as always with a tiny complaint
review/text: I've been drinking Good Earth Original tea for about 30 years (first discovered in a Good Earth Restaurant). 10 years ago, it occurred to me that the smell of it was good enough to substitute for the smell of coffee in the morning, and that was the key to relinquishing my coffee habit. It's great hot and it makes terrific iced tea. So here's the tiny complaint: every once in a while, I get a bag of it that tastes bitter. I've always assumed that the random collection of spices in that particular tea bag just happened to contain too much of something in the spice mix. I know if that was my first taste of Good Earth tea, I'd never try it again! The bitterness problem has always been rare and random until recently. First I accidentally ordered a batch that wasn't caffeine free, and noticed toward the end of that supply that I didn't remember having any bitter bags. When I re-ordered the next supply - caffeine free, I got so many bitter bags that I almost gave up on my beloved Good Earth tea. Good Earth people, if you're reading this, I'd love some input about the problem. Meanwhile, I'll keep drinking my cup of Good Earth every morning because it's just the best tea on earth!

review/text: The 2nd image makes a point of showing you this product has no artificial flavors, with a close up of the ingredients list, but this in fact DOES have artificial flavors. That was very disappointing... especially since we ordered a large quantity! We prefer the "Sweet and Spicy Red Tea", which had no artificial flavors but otherwise exact same ingredients in slightly different order and tasted better to my family, but Good Earth has discontinued that flavor. I love the "Original" flavor, but I don't like to ingest the "artificial anything" when I am drinking so much of this! The organic does not have artificial flavor in the "original caffeine free" flavor, but it is not nearly as strong.  Maybe that is the effect of the artificial ingredient.  How can they say this is "original" when they added an artificial ingredient?  (It wasn't in the "real" original... and the product has varied on having and not having that ingredient).

Not only did they change the look of the box, but they went to the dark side and changed the recipe as well.  Did anyone notice that they didn't have lemongrass in it anymore?  Did anyone notice that they took off the "Gluten-free" stamp?  And last but not least, they added artificial flavoring to it.  Are you kidding?  So, they took a winner and turned it into a lousy product.  Does that make sense to anyone else out there?  I sent them all back!

It is a sweeter tea that has a nice zip to it, but I don't find it too sweet.  One thing I particularly love about this tea is that it continues to taste great no matter how long I leave the bag in.  When I am working at home, I often make a large mug with one bag and then keep reheating and refilling throughout the day as needed.  This makes it not only a nice addition to my day but very economical:) The fact that it's a bit sweet helps keep down any post-meal "dessert" cravings.

I usually would get this at the grocery store, but they were having a hard time keeping it stock. A couple days was one thing, but when it went on to a couple of weeks I had to do something! So I ordered online. Now I have a back up reserve - it's that good!!<br /><br />I take the individually wrapped tea bags with me wherever I go - friends, meetings, even restaurants. Quite often the aroma wafting outwards will prompt someone to ask me about it. I love that - I'll tell them about it and then I always try to have an extra or two to give out. Waitresses are always asking me about it, and I always offer one to them.<br /><br />If you enjoy cinnamon and warm spices like that, you'll definitey enjoy this tea! And with no caffine you can even enjoy it late at night too!

How could it be so sweet with no sugar? If you look at the packaging it "looks" natural and healthy, but then read the ingredients - number three is "ARTIFICIAL FLAVOR." Considering that the order of the ingredient listing indicates relative percentage of contents, a significant portion of this tea is "Artifical Flavor." Which means what? What the heck is it made of? Who knows - this stuff is getting tossed in the trash and I'll never trust GoodEarth again. By the way, this is manufactured by Tata Enterprises out of India - you might want to do some research about them.

review/summary: Updated Review - The original was best, why change?
review/text: Review update - 7/12/2012<br />I'm sad to say that the new, purple box packaging for this tea contains artificial flavors.  Why, oh why, did Good Earth have to change this tea, when it was perfectly fine and good the way it was?  I am terribly disappointed by this change, and have amended my star rating to reflect this.<br /><br />Original Review - 10/4/2010<br />First, to the Natural/Artificial concerns - it really does say Natural Flavors in the ingredient list, NOT artificial as some of the reviews state.  Box also states "No sugar, caffeine, artificial flavors, colors or preservatives".  I've submitted a picture of the ingredients list to Amazon, which you can view at the top of this item page.<br /><br />Ingredients list:<br />Red Rooibos, Chicory Root, Natural Flavor, Rosehips, Cinnamon, Lemongrass, Peppermint, Papaya, Chamomile, Panax Ginseng Leaves, Anise Seed, Dandelion Root, Ginger Root, Orange Oil, Orange Peel.<br /><br />I was given my first box of this tea by a friend who knew I liked cinnamon tea.  Up to that point, my favorite tea was Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice.  But when I tried Good Earth, I fell in love!  Now I cannot find it anymore in any of the local stores that carried it, so I signed up for the regular shipments from Amazon.<br /><br />Everyone I have shared this tea with tell me how much they enjoy it, that it hardly seems possible for tea to have such intense flavor and not need sweetening.  I have to be sure to get some before my husband & kids finish the box without my getting a chance to have a few myself!  Seems like every time I visit my mom now, she makes up some of this for us to share as some iced tea.<br /><br />I do not use any sweetener, which says a lot because I use sweetener with pretty much every other kind of herbal tea I drink.  Good Earth is great hot or cold, and it sure does give my tastebuds a gingerbread-like warmth on a fall or winter morning.  There is no tea-ish, bitter taste or aftertaste.<br /><br />If you love cinnamon, gingerbread, or a really good caffeine-free tea that doesn't need sweetening, give this one a try!

review/text: Good Earth Tea (Original Sweet and Spicy)~ whether caffeinated or decaffeinated has been my favorite tea for many years.  I am sick with disappointment over degraded and truly unrecognizable taste of this formerly perfect cup of tea. I will be telling all the friends I have introduced to the "good old recipe" over the years that our Good Earth Tea is no longer the same and that they should not waste their money on the new<br />recipe. I'll be taking the last four boxes I bought back to the grocery store for a refund. I called the TATA company this morning to find out the scoop on the change of the taste of the tea and to register my disappointment.  If anyone from the new Good Earth Company reads Amazon reviews, please take note of all the complaints and plead with your company to go back to the "good old recipe" once again!

review/summary: Helps with sinus infection
review/text: I find that the sweet and spicy tea helps - and this is my suspicion - to thin out mucus and make it run clear when I'm in the midst of a severe sinus infection. Not only that, but it seems that it does so as good if not better than any herbal tea advertised as helping with respiratory ailments. The ingredient profile offers a potential explanation: in addition to the "dreadful" artificial flavor that some reviewers seem to be getting hung up about, the tea contains rooibos, chicory root, rosehips, cinnamon, peppermint, lemongrass, papaya leaves, chamomile, panax ginseng leaves, anise seed, dandelion root, ginger root, orange peel and orange oil. I suspect that the aromatic herbs and the papaya are what really help to cut the snot. So, to my fellow sinus sufferers, I implore you to put this in your pot and brew it. And let me know on via review on Amazon if you share the same suspicions. EDIT: I'm not sure if it's the vasoconstrictive effect from the mild amount of caffeine in the caffeinated version of this tea, versus the herbal formulation, that was responsible for its decongestant effect.

review/summary: No Flavor!
review/text: We've enjoyed lots of Good Earth Original sweet and spicy tea, but the stuff I received from Amazon.com is nothing like it!  Good Earth tea is naturally sweet and spicy, delicious -- but the case I ordered from Amazon.com is tasteless, like drinking a cup of plain hot water!  I noticed that the freshness date is still good, but I also noticed that the papers attached to the tea bag strings are dark and sticky.  I think that this case of tea was not stored properly, and perhaps it was exposed to too much dampness or climate change?  The little paper labels, which each have a unique inspirational verse, were almost illegible.  Unfortunately I can't return the tea, so I think I will let the Good Earth tea manufacturers know about it.  Perhaps it was an error made on the part of the manufacturers.

review/summary: Wonderful - great tasting
review/text: For some reason, my local grocery stores have stopped carrying this tea. We love it and often drink it, so I opted to buy via Amazon. A friend told me that she was able to get it through Amazon and I was surprised, but we found it here.<br />Excellent tea with a strong but sweet flavor and caffeine free. No need to add sweetener. The smell alone makes it worth while to get.<br />Fast delivery from vendor.

review/summary: I love this tea!!!!!
review/text: This tea has a cinnamon/spice, sweet taste but it does not contain sugar or sugar substitute.  Somehow Good Earth combines oils and ingredients to give it a hint of sweetness that I love. Now I brew it like sun tea for a wonderful drink all summer long.  Beats the Diet Coke I thought I was hooked on!  Thank you, Good Earth.  I'll be buying this for a loooooong time-!
