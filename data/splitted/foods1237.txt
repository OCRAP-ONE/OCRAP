review/summary: GREAT CHOCOLATE CHIP MUFFINS
review/text: My wife loves these muffins.  We've tried a variety of brands and, inevitably, we come back to the Krusteaz brand.  Unfortunately, we are unable to find them stocked on store shelves like they used to be.<br /><br />The muffins are moist and loaded with chocolate chips and, relatively low fat and low calorie especially when compared to other brands.<br /><br />Based on her feedback and based on the fact we've tried lots of other brands, I would suggest these are the best!  We will continue to buy in bulk from Amazon as long as we can.  We usually buy them by the case and are about ready to order again.<br /><br />Give them a try!

review/summary: Buyer Beware
review/text: These used to be called "Chocolate Chip" and now they are called "Chocolate Chunk"... I wasn't aware that the ingredients were different until I ordered a case... now they have "artificial flavor" in the chocolate chunks instead of vanilla, and they also have "partially hydrogenated soybean and cottonseed oils" and "caramel color" in the ingredients...I have always preferred Krusteaz products for their short and legible ingredients lists...now I am disappointed!

review/summary: Love these!
review/text: In terms of box mix chocolate chip muffins, these are by far the favorite of my family and myself. They're better than the other chocolate chip muffin mixes we've tried, and my preferred brand to buy. They're extremely easy to make (though that's pretty much a given with a box mix), have a good amount of chocolate chips, come out really nicely, and are good both fresh out of the oven and a couple days later. I will admit I prefer them fresh out of the oven, though! I'd recommend these over any of the other big-name commercial chocolate chip muffin mixes.

review/summary: 1 Star is actually too many stars
review/text: I was suckered into buying these cause it was the only ones i saw in a store one time that said they were San Marzano.  THEY ARENT!  let me repeat THEY ARENT.<br />You have to double check, like i did after using these... cause I have used other San Marzano tomatoes before in the past and they were delicious and sweet and packed with flavor.  These were acidic, bordering on no flavor and even their color was way off compared to the real ones.<br />These said they were grown in Canada... Im sorry but Canada is not Italy, you need to have the ones from the San Marzano region where they are grown and have an official seal from the government of Italy to say they are "True" San Marzano tomatoes.  I went to another store and noticed that Cento have that seal, if you dont believe me, Google it... cause it will show what seals need to be there from the Italian Government.  The Cento brand are quite good the money, i paid $3.50 a can for those compared to the $4.19 for these fake ones.  They are great for sauces or even just put straight on Pizza with a little sea salt.  Save your money and buy another brand, even if its a bit more expensive, its worth the cost to get the real deal.

review/summary: NOT Real San Marzano tomatoes!
review/text: Real San Marzano tomatoes are grown in volcanic soil in Italy, and get a special designation by the Italian department of agriculture. The reason being they are prized and generally cost more than other tomatoes.<br /><br /> Now when it comes to general tomatoes, US and Canada can produce them just as well as anyone else or better.  This is not the case with San Marzano tomatoes.  The soil gives them a distinctive taste, and they are well known to make the best non acidic tasting sauces.<br /><br />This marketing ploy is as if I made a brand named "Extra Virgin" brand olive oil when in reality it was regular olive oil.  Even if these are grown with the same seeds, it is not the same.  Also, these are not much cheaper than the real thing.  If you can does not have a seal on it from the Italian DOP, They are not real.  This can also deceives by putting italian words on it etc.<br /><br />In any decent supermarket, you can find the real deal.  In NY they are easy to find, but in other areas of the country it is sometimes hard to find.  Cento cans real San Marzano tomatoes, so if you see their variety that says San Marzano, pick them up.  They have the seal on them too.

review/summary: We liked the crushed version very much
review/text: We were tried and true Progresso customers for many years until they stopped producing crushed tomatoes last year. We both like a more chunky and thick sauce and as such, whole tomatoes, chuny tomatoes just don't work. Crushed tomatoes do.<br />We tried one of the other San Marzano canned whole tomatoes and crushed them ourselves. The taste was very very good, better than the Progresso's and by hand crushing we were able to make a very nice thick sauce. But it had little hard things in it, like large pieces of pepper but not pepper and we don't know if that came from those canned tomatoes or the parmesan cheese we used ( Kraft ) Stay tuned on that.<br />This disappointment led us to made a whole new batch of our twice a year sauce making binge as I was not sure if I would eat that other sauce. We had only a couple cans of these San Marzano's and let me tell you, we are very very happy we were forced to make a new batch. The sauce that we made from this product is very tasty, starts off nice and thick although not as sweet as the other brand. But very nice. We used the usual ingredients and a nice wine. Came out on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being perfect and 1 being the least, I'd call this batch an 8+, maybe a 9 and that means Happy Happy Joy Joy.

review/text: I love salty food. I shouldn't have so much of it, but I love salty food. I know this isn't the best meal I could probably have but with today's busy schedules and economic downturns, we all have our crosses to bear. This is a phenomenally good-tasting meal (add a salad) and is a lot cheaper (and better for you) than a fast-food burger and fries. Is this health-food? No. Is it a bit on the salty side? Maybe for some people who think regular gravy is too salty. It isn't OVERLY salty for what it is. It isn't brine. It is very rich, flavorful, packed full of meat, diced potatoes and sliced carrots, and a great thing to have on the shelf when you're too tired to cook or too broke to care. Our local grocery chain has these on sale this week for $2 if you buy 10 of them....you could save a lot of money by buying them here on Amazon and have this delivered. My favorites (so far)are the turkey and stuffing with gravy, and the cheese manicotti. Fabulous. I am impressed. I thought they'd be second-rate because they are shelf-stable. Nope. Try them out and see.

review/summary: Mass Quantities of Runny Salty Gravy with a Little Bit of Other Stuff
review/text: I certainly cannot recommend this product.  It consists of a bowl of very watery gravy with a sliver of dry, stringy beef, a few small chunks of potatoes, and a few slivers of carrots.  It's a rip-off, in other words.  When a company sinks to the point of having to cheap out so badly on low-cost filler foods like potatoes and carrots, that's pretty pathetic.<br /><br />The product doesn't taste good, either; it also has a weird vinegary flavor, and is far too salty.  Salty as in teetering on inedible.<br /><br />To avoid wasting mine, I am adding dehydrated vegetables to try to make this product edible, and that's just barely working.  I hate to waste food, so I will probably donate these rather than throw them out, in the hope that the recipients might find them useful.  I live in the South now, where many people seem to like very salty foods.<br /><br />I've tried a number of low-end convenience products, even though obviously like everyone else I'd always prefer to eat fresh halibut and bison steaks etc.  I'm not blind to the benefits of products like these, and have been trying some as an experiment.  I don't see any reason why such products couldn't be great; but usually they aren't that hot, if at least passable for their purpose.  But this one is truly bad.  I really do recommend that you don't buy it.

review/text: The beef pot roast with potatoes and carrots is pretty middle of the line for the Hormel meals. The thing that makes me like the red meat meals less than some of the chicken and pasta meals is that they tend to be so salty! (Although make no mistake, there is just as much sodium in all the meals no matter if it tastes salty or not.) The carrots are way too mushy but the potatoes are okay. Much better than any of their mashed potatoes that's for sure. The meat is pretty dry and slightly chewy (which is strange for a meat that just falls apart under your fork) but there's so much gravy that you can almost pretend not to notice. It's not really bad, per say, but not really great either.<br /><br />For what this is -- a non-perishable prepared food that is fairly cheap -- it's pretty good. It will fill you up quickly at very low effort and cost, but if you are going to compare it to something you can make yourself, well, there really isn't any comparison.

The apple taste works much better when combined with other ingredients. Basically, it's a replacement for recipes that call for rolled oats. As such, it adds better flavor and texture than just plain oats.<br /><br />The downside is that the caloric content is pretty high. A one cup serving has 210 calories, 30 of which are from fat. But, the fiber content is good, and it also has a decent amount of protein from the soy and is very low in sodium. The nutrition info is as follows:<br /><br />Serving size = 1 cup<br />Calories = 210<br />Calories from fat = 30<br />Total fat = 3.5g (5%)<br />Saturated fat = 0.5g (3%)<br />No trans fat<br />No cholesterol<br />Sodium = 15mg (1%)<br />Potassium = 230mg (7%)<br />Total carb 38g (13%)<br />Fiber 7g (28%) (2g soluble, 5g insoluble)<br />Sugar 8g<br />Protein 8g (13%)<br /><br />MDR: 0% for vitamin A, C; 6% calcium, 10% iron, 15% phosphorus, 15% magnesium, 8% zinc<br /><br />Top ingredients: whole wheat, whole grain barley, rolled whole oat flakes, toasted soy nuggets, brown sugar, dehydrated apples, flax seed, dehydrated yogurt, [plus various flavorings]<br /><br />So, as a cereal 1 star. As a baking ingredient, 4 stars. Average it to 2.5, rounded up to 3.

review/summary: The jury is still out....
review/text: Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head. I will say that I am sleeping more soundly at night, but to wake up feeling this groggy, and to have it last well into the morning is not fun. I will be testing more, but it seems to be doing funny things to me.

review/text: I had been waking up with cramps in my feet and calves.  I only used one scoop in my juice once a day and this product stopped the cramps within a couple days.<br /><br />I recently ran out of the Natural Calm and started using Source Naturals Magnesium Malate (I had bought both products so I could compare the two).  Within a week the cramps are back.  I also have been getting restless legs at night, which I had forgotten about when I was taking the Natural Calm.  I'm ordering more Natural Calm now.

review/summary: Fibromyalgia
review/text: I had been enduring an agonizing week-long episode of what appears to be a fibromyalgic Tetany Syndrome of excruciating pain radiating from hip-joint to knee-joint along the muscles between the joints. In trying to describe to myself the electro-convulsive nature of it, I said it appeared to be like a fibrillation - only deep in my hip, and immediately the word "magnesium" popped into my mind. Dunno why.<br /><br />Tottered out to kitchen and One teaspoon of Natural Calm and 20 minutes later the convulsive constant spasms stopped. I was free from pain and able to sleep. Have had to keep a steady repeated dosage to keep the spasms at bay and it is difficult to admit that I probably have Fibromyalgia, but thank God for a remedy to the pain.<br /><br />I've kept the Natural Calm in my cupboard because of a peculiar muscle flutter/twitch I would get around the eyes when magnesium levels were low. Know this is just an anecdotal tale, but screaming pain one moment and no pain 20 minutes later, only difference being the magnesium is a tale that needs to be told.

review/summary: Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon magnesium is good for regularity
review/text: I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.

Every evening, I have a mug with a heaping teaspoon of Natural Calm in some water.  It really does help with my ability to fall asleep quickly and stay asleep all night.  I used to lie in bed and wait to fall asleep, sometimes for hours.  Now I can't even remember trying to get to sleep.  This product is wonderful!

review/text: I use this to calm my generally overactive system, deal with stress and sleep better, and it's not unpleasant. It's sweetened with Stevia, which I prefer to any other sweetener. One star off: it's horribly SWEET!! Most American-made sweet goods are sweet to such a degree that sometimes it's hard to detect any other taste, but even by those standards this stuff is incredibly oversweetened. I'll use it, but I wish there were another, less sweet and more natural flavor available. How about, say, mango or grape...?

review/text: I am disappointed to report that although this product did seem to have an effect on my anxiety the first time I took it, the second time I took it, it made me very nauseated. It may be the stevia; I am quite sensitive to artificial sweeteners (although I thought stevia was natural). At any rate, I am going to have to get rid of this product because I'd rather be anxious than vomiting. Call me crazy. If you are sensitive to non-sugar sweeteners, you may want to try a sample of this beforehand if you can find one before you shell out the money.

I'd rather take Bluebonnet Calcium/Mag Vit D liquid, and that is a thick goopy liquid but I only need 2 TB of it. This is just hard drinking a whole glass. Aside from the texture/sense issue, the product works well, and I don't get restless legs at night. It does help me sleep and I am in a better mood since taking it.

review/text: I do not get the calm relaxing better sleeping side effects from this. What I do get though is something that keeps my bowels regular. I take a medicine that causes heavy constipation, some users resort to taking laxatives every day which is addictive and dangerous. This is the best thing to clear you out and move things along. I've had two children and they send you home with a stool softener (Collace for me) and this works far better than collace. I started out about a week on just one large teaspoon. I was very bloated and backed up the entire time, it wasn't really doing much, then I upped to two large teaspons, without being graphic, it completely fixed my problem, although there were a few times if I hadn't been very close to a bathroom it could have resulted in a very traumatizing event. I don't think it tastes bad at all, I enjoy the warm drink in the evening, I put honey in mine, and use the natural one.

review/summary: LOVE this stuff!
review/text: Our chiropractor recommended Natural Calm for more muscle relaxation and deeper sleep - and my entire family takes it.  We've adjusted the dose for our 10 y/o downward (1/4 t. per day) and that's been better for him, but for my husband and me, the 1/2 t. dose is just right.  :)<br /><br />Our child has benefitted from it in that when he sleeps more deeply and doesn't wake easily, he has better days in lessons and is better able to focus.  That alone would make me re-purchase this product!  :)<br /><br />When we take it, we sleep better, more deeply, and if(when) we get up in the night to use the restroom, we don't struggle to fall back asleep - sleep is just *there*.  :)  I've also found that my "side stitches" - where the muscles at my ribcage contract and pull (it's uncomfortable) - go away when I take NC.  That's a beautiful side effect from taking it - and one I didn't expect.  My husband's infamous "Charley Horses" that wrack his legs with pain are virtually gone, too - and adding the NC has been the only change in his habits, so it's not like he's attributing the lack of cramps to anything else he's doing.<br /><br />I'm also a PCOS patient, which means I trend towards overproducing insulin.  With that, comes rough elbows and ridiculously dry skin - the NC has helped in that area as well.  My normal moisturizer doesn't touch my elbow-roughness, but the NC takes care of it on its own.  w00t!<br /><br />We like the lemon-raspberry flavour as well - it's like a hot lemonade in a mug.  :)<br /><br />All in all, we'll definitely be ordering more - I don't ever want to be without this supplement!

review/text: Before I  bought this I read all the reviews and they are all pretty accurate. It's a great product. I take 1.5 tsp twice a day once in the morning and once at night. It helped me sleep better, it made going to the bathroom easier, I wasn't craving junk food as much as usual (I'm usually pretty healthy about what I eat), and I just felt better in general. Great product I would give it 10 stars if I could!

review/summary: The cure for charlie horses!
review/text: I was looking for Mag Citrate in a fast-acting form that didn't taste terrible, and I found it in this product. I have a history of HypoMag including severe muscle spasms and prolonged charlie horses. I haven't had one charlie horse since starting on the mag...I am so thankful! Magnesium is a natural muscle relaxer and a vital mineral for bone and muscle health. I wish it was a little more affordable (because I have to use more of it than the average person) but I do plan to buy it again whenever possible.

review/summary: Great for kids to get their magnesium!
review/text: I can't write this review based off of continued use, as we just received it this week.  However, I wanted to say how glad I am that this product is available.  I have one child with asthma and another with autism.  Magnesium is suppose to benefit them both a lot, BUT getting children to take it is another story!  It's very sour and zingy, if that's a word, so the magnesium has taken a lot of coaxing to get them to take daily.  So I find this product of Peter Gillham's, and I'm so happy.  The kids say it tastes like warm sweet lemonade, and down it goes like a treat.  Also, very comforting to take just before going to bed.  Yeah!

review/text: As a sports referee for Basketball and Lacrosse, I do a lot of running, stopping, changing directions in an instance. This takes a toll on bones, muscles and joints. I usually feel the pain the next day after officiating these two sports. I've been using Calm for approximately four weeks and since I've started I have no soreness, my joints and bones feel good and my muscles are very relaxed. It does have a "good" effect on your bowel movement, it's not a bad thing, it keeps you cleansed. I would highly recommend this for any with muscle, joint or bone pain.

review/text: I bought the "natural" flavor, assuming it would be flavorless.  WRONG!  I bought it with the intention of adding it to my morning protein shake but it has a somewhat bitter citrus-y flavor that doesn't work in the shake.  I guess I need to try it just in water and see if I can tolerate it that way.  It's probably a great product/supplement but I'm having trouble getting past the taste.  Probably would have been better to get a flavored variety.

I have been having horrible health issues that started after taking a diet pill which has caused me drastic changes to my health.  I have been having issues with my digestive system, emotions, IBS, I never had heartburn now I do, I have cracked tongue, dry tongue, metallic taste in my mouth, I dont digest well my food.  I have done too many tests and nothing has been coming up but only GERD and have taken so many treatments for this but nothing helps me. :(<br /><br />I thought maybe this would help me but I dont see any change in anything.  Its been 5 days since I started.  I started with half teaspoon in morning and night, and then after a day did 1 tsp twice a day, then did 2 x a day but started to have diarrhea so now I am back to 1 twice a day.  I do not see it has made any changes, maybe it takes time, we will see.<br /><br />The delivery was fast taking into consideration I live in Doha, Qatar. and the package was in good condition.<br /><br />Will keep updating.

review/text: I tried every possible remedy I could find and nothing gave me consistent results. This product changed my life after 20 years of suffering from IBS-C. I only take one heaping tablespoon a day. I have been using it for about 2 years now and the results are very consistent. I ramped up my dose until I experienced loose stools and then backed off just a little until everything became normal. I am now thinking of breaking it into two smaller doses because the effervescent nature makes me burp like crazy for the first 15 minutes after taking it. But believe me, no matter what, it is worth it. I will most likely take this product for the rest of my life. THANK YOU to the makers.
