review/summary: Chocolatey good
review/text: These are really good.  The chocolate is dark and strongly cocoa.  When you first open the box you'll think, "Is this all I get?"  These are mouth-size treats that can be nibbled, or popped into your mouth.  They are so rich though, you really are satisfied after just two.  The only bad thing I would mention is they do not last very long after being opened.  Mine sat on the counter (inside the box but the cellophane inside warp was open) and after several days...the cookies tasted stale.  May not be a problem in your house if they are devoured in a day or two.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Yummy classic cookie
review/text: When first taking a bite of Mallomars, there does not appear anything unusual about this pure chocolate-coated cookie.  But once knowing about its 90 year history with the Nabisco Company, it is a cookie filled with not only a marshmallow and bottom cookie wafer and outer chocolate covering that was indeed a precursor to the now all too familiar s'mores concoction.  And most importantly, this is a cookie that has filled the memories of many with much indulgence and nostalgia.<br /><br />After opening the box in which the cookies came in, I noticed one major difference with this package of Mallomars, it no longer contains the nice yellow wrapping that needed to be torn to get to box's opening and rather replaced by a simple plain yellow box with the regular cover design with the trademark name, picture of the cookie, and nutritional facts on the back.  Despite that difference, it is the cookie that matters and its semi-dark sweet outer layer and fluffy marshmallow filling that may satisfy one's sweet tooth.  And it is highly recommended for anyone seeking an alternative to the chocolate chip cookie or ginger snaps.

review/summary: Stale
review/text: I haven't ever had any actual Mallomars, so I thought I'd give them a try since there was nothing else good in the newsletter.  I like chocolate and marshmallow and cookies, so this should have been good.  They might be if you buy them from a real store.  The box I got though tasted stale.  The chocolate had that white stuff on it and the cookies were kind of dried out.  Some were broken from the shipping too.  So my advice would be if you want some Mallomars to get them fresh from the store and don't buy them off a website.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I had these as a kid and remember them being great, and it seems my memory is right.  To call them a 'cookie' is a bit of a misnomer, they are mostly chocolate covered marshmallow, with a little bit of 'cookie' at the bottom.  Which is OK in my book!<br /><br />They came in the mail not damaged at all, which is good for something as fragile as a chocolate covered marshmallow.<br /><br />I don't think there is much else to say - they are delicious and they came undamaged.  Five stars!

review/summary: Bad batch?  Poor storage conditions?  Something went wrong.
review/text: The chocolate coating on my Mallomars had a dusty discoloration, like you sometimes see on chocolate that's past it's prime.  That "sugar bloom" usually doesn't affect the taste, so I tried them anyway.  I found the chocolate to be quite bitter.  On about half of the cookies, the lower cookie half had separated from the top half of the cookie.  The cookie was crumbly and stale.  The marshmallow had a "stretchy" quality, not the fluffy goodness I'd expected.<br /><br />With so many other reviewers raving about the product, I don't think this is just a difference of opinion.  I think I had a bad batch, or these weren't stored properly before delivery, or something.  Maybe they were outdated -- I searched the box for a sell-by date and did not find it.

The recent package I bought had the same issues others have mentioned, the chocolate was discolored and some had melted enough to stick to the packaging such that when you pulled them out the cookie base crumbled.  However, the taste wasn't off at all and it was all going to the same place in the end anyway.

review/summary: Yummy ,tasty treat
review/text: I've seen Mallomars on the shelves for years but never felt that urge to purchase them. But I was finally able to give them a try and I was glad I did.<br /><br />When I bit into my first Mallomar, it took me a minute to get used to the texture and the taste. It's chocolate covered marshallow on a graham cracker. I expected there to be some crunch from the cracker but the entire cookie is soft. The chocolate crumbles a little when you bite into it. After eating two more, I decided that I liked them. And that I needed to put the box away fast or I was going to consume them in one sitting.<br /><br />Mallomar is a nice alternative to s'mores. It's neater and you don't burn your mouth because the marshallow is too hot. So now I finally know what the hype is all about.<br /><br />3/5

review/text: I've never had anything like this in my life before. Cookies are always good but whoever thought to put chocolate on them is a genus and should win that award that Martin Luther King won a few years ago. These have marshmallows in them too, just like the picture on the box but not as big. If you love chocolate I would recommend these.<br /><br />Mallomars go great with milk, especially when you eat them and drink the milk in the same sitting. It'd be cool if you could eat these on Mars too. Maybe someday.

review/summary: I loved these as a kid but there''s no place for them in my cabinets now
review/text: When I saw these available through the Vine program I was compelled to order them simply because I hadn't had a Mallomar in probably thirty to forty years. Well, my taste buds have clearly changed. I watch what I eat now and try to eat simple and healthy. These are basically junk food. After eating two of them I immediately knew the remainder of the small package would go to one of my grand nieces or nephews. Marshmallows, milk chocolate and some of the unhealthiest oils and saturated fats are the primary ingredients of these cookies. Nobody that cares about eating healthy will buy these. Then again, to their credit, Nabisco is not marketing them as a "health" food. There are a lot of alleged "health bars" on the market that are just as bad for you as these. But even as traditional cookies go, if I'm going to eat junk food cookies (Oreos, Famous Amos, etc.) there are many others I would choose before Mallomars. But, to each is own. There's little doubt there are a lot of people who love these things. They've been around for years, actually decades, and there's still a lot of people who pay little attention to what foods they put in their bodies. If I turned the clock back thirty years to when I was raising a family with young children, knowing what I know now about the importance of good health, I would never give these to my kids.

review/summary: Is there a rating for "Meh"?
review/text: It's been many years since I tried Mallomars, and my wife and child never had them before...this seemed like a good time to introduce them to a childhood favorite of mine.<br /><br />While the box boasted a picture of dark chocolate, the inside was a different story. The Mallomars looked dried out since the chocolate was a light brown color. The marshmallow was not centered on the cookie at all. I can't speak for every box of Mallomars, but this batch seemed pretty below average.<br /><br />[Pls see the picture I uploaded to the "Customer Images" section for reference].<br /><br />Each of us had a different reaction upon tasting them. I found the marshmallow to be a lot chewier my childhood recollection, and I liked the chocolate. My spouse thought the cookie itself was dry and the chocolate was without flavor, and our child went right for the marshmallow, separating it from the cookie and eating the cookie last.<br /><br />Overall, these were okay. Not bad, but not earth-shatteringly good. Hopefully our next batch will be tastier.

review/summary: Cookie Concoction Confection
review/text: I remember seeing Mallomars in the supermarket when I was a kid.  My mom wouldn't buy them.  She said they were too expensive.  She was counting every penny, and she was right.  There are only eighteen cookies in a package, and budget-conscious parents really couldn't afford them.  Still true today.<br /><br />I did buy them once I was on my own, to satisfy my curiosity.  I liked them, but I was counting pennies, too, so they were a rare treat.  Actually, it's been years since I had Mallomars.  My husband does our grocery shopping, and he'd never had them at all.  They certainly weren't on his radar.<br /><br />They are now, though.  The cookies - no, they're not cookies.  Well, they have a wafer, but they have a dark chocolate coating, and that's candy.  They have marshmallow too, so they're a sweet snack.  Heck, if you have two or three, they're dessert!  Anyway, my Mallomars arrived with a fat bloom.  They got warm somewhere, and they could have had bloom if I bought them at the store, I mean if my husband had bought them!  But they were not stale, they were wonderfully fresh.  And they taste a lot better than I remembered.<br /><br />A delicate wafer is topped with marshmallow, and this combo is thinly coated with chocolate.  The wafer and marshmallow practically melt in your mouth, a blast of sweet.  Then the surprisingly intense chocolate hits, and lingers on your palate.  Mallomars are simple, yet surprisingly sophisticated.<br /><br />If only they were available all year, and didn't cost so much.  And Nabisco tempers the chocolate so it won't bloom so easily; it doesn't hurt anything but it's a turn off.  Then I'd rate them five stars.  Oh, and so would my husband.  You should have seen the look on his face when he tried his first one!  And he's very picky about store bought cookies.<br /><br />Edit:  Recently I purchased a four-pack of Mallomars from Amazon.  Well, heads up, there is no bloom on these cookies!  Every single cookie looks and tastes like it just exited the Nabisco bakery.  I took them to work; they didn't last till lunch.  So, I would advise waiting till the weather is good and cold before buying Mallomars.  Then make your grab.  I may buy more and stock up.....  I'm glad I got the opportunity to try these again in the Vine program.

review/summary: A CHILDHOOD FAVORITE...
review/text: This is a delicious combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie. If one wants to heighten the experience, put a mallowmar in the microwave for ten seconds for a gooey moment of sheers bliss. At least, this is how I remember them.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when I received my order, the one box of cookies had been carelessly mailed in a manila envelope. Consequently, the cookies arrived in pieces, crushed almost beyond recognition. There was not a single cookie that arrived intact.<br /><br />I did notice, however, that the chocolate, instead of being a dark, velvety brown, was grayish in appearance, as if it had been laying on the sender's shelf for years. The cookie part seemed dry as sawdust and that is what it tasted like. These were definitely not the cookies of my memory. Shame on the sender for not taking care when mailing them to ensure that they were fresh, as well as properly packaged to avoid damage.

review/summary: Caution: High Fructose Corn Syrup
review/text: I have no idea why an established product such as this would want to send out samples to vine members to review.  That said, the box I got suffered from the lack of sturdy packaging and about half of the cookies were broken and they all had a whitish tinge to the chocolate part that made me think they had been around too long.<br /><br />I am always careful to read labels because I am intolerant of High Fructose Corn Syrup and when I find it on the label as I did in this product I cannot eat it.  I assume that the HFCS is in the marshmallows because all marshmallow products seem to contain it these days.  It amuses me when a product advertises that it has been on the market for over 75 years and yet contains HFCS because this means it is not the original formula by any standards.<br /><br />My 6 year old grandson would not eat these, but my husband ate them so they did not go to waste.

review/summary: Fattening, sweet cookies that were poorly packaged
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:54 Mins<br /><br /></span>I cannot recommend these unhealthy cookies. They contain too much fat, sometimes canola oil (more healthy), sometimes palm oil (less healthy).  They are very sweet. The chocolate is not as good as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y0OFRQ">Valrhona Manjari Dark Chocolate Bar - 64% - 1 box, 20 2.46 oz bars</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Q5B60">Scharffen Berger Semisweet 62% Cacao Baking Chocolate Bar 9.7oz.</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N9VLJ2">Ghirardelli Intense Dark Premium Dark Chocolate Assortment 50 Pack</a>.  It is however palatable.  The cookie layer was soggy. I have eaten the UK equivalent of these Mallomars (Chocolate Marshmallows) as a child and the base was much crisper. The base tasted stale.  The cookies were broken, some stuck together, others fell apart.<br /><br />Unhealthy foods like this are to be avoided, except perhaps for children's parties, but even then this package was so badly handled that the cookies were not presentable.  Instead get ideas for healthy food from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060928115">Everyday Cooking with Dr. Dean Ornish: 150 Easy, Low-Fat, High-Flavor Recipes</a>. If you must eat cookies, then <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YHLS8W">Kashi TLC Cookies, Oatmeal Dark Chocolate, 8.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a> might be a healthier alternative.<br /><br />I note that the Chocolate Marshmallows that I had as a child were individually wrapped in foil and according to Wikipedia, under the heading Chocolate-coated marshmallow treats some use a shortbread base (firmer) with an Italian meringue which is stiffer than the marshmallow. It also reports that Nabisco only makes Mallomars from October to April, either for marketing reasons or because they do not keep well in warm tempratures - it would be good from someone from Nabisco to verify if this is the case. Clearly my Mallomars suffered from poor storage and inadequate packing, as did those of many other reviewers.

review/summary: Delicate Cookies--Love at First Bite!
review/text: A friend introduced me to Mallomars in the 60's, and it was love at first bite!  There's something inwardly satisfying about a delicate, crumbly cookie, topped with tasty, fluffy marshmallow, that is completely covered with a thin coating of delicious chocolate.  Is it any surprise that Mallomars have been pleasing the palates of cookie lovers ever since 1913?<br /><br />Mallomars are pretty good nutritionally:  two (2) cookies have 120 calories (45 calories from fat), 18g carbohydrates (1g from dietary fiber, 12g from sugar), 1g protein, and only 40mg sodium.  The sodium is negligible, if you're on a low-to-moderate-sodium diet!<br /><br />To me, these cookies taste completely "real" or "natural", because they don't leave any artificial chemical aftertaste. The main ingredients are sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, milk, and vitamin-enriched flour.  However, they also contain processed chocolate (processed with alkali and soy lecithin), high fructose corn syrup, and palm/palm kernel oil, so you shouldn't buy them if you're concerned about your intake of either high fructose corn syrup or saturated-fat vegetable oil.  There is no cholesterol.<br /><br />The odd thing about me and Mallomars, is that I love them even though I don't like plain marshmallows or chocolate-covered marshmallow eggs or bunnies.  It must be the marshmallow filling recipe and the cookie base that makes the difference.<br /><br />This listing is for four (4) boxes of Mallomars with 18 cookies each.  Probably it's best to order Mallomars only in the winter months.  The cookies travel pretty well, but the chocolate coating is thin, and it can melt if subjected to high warehouse or delivery-truck temperatures.

review/text: I am a fan of fresh baked goods and tend to eschew the traditional brand-name cookies. If my husband buys Chips Ahoy, for example, he is safe from having me share them.<br /><br />There are exceptions to my rule. Vienna Fingers, Milanos...I will allow them into my kitchen and my tummy.<br /><br />But none of them remotely compare to the cookie I actually crave: the not-remotely-humble Mallomar.<br /><br />The delicious, thin dark chocolate cover is in complete harmony with the amount of marshmallow and graham cracker cookie bottom. The balance is exquisite. This cookie is every bit as special as any baked good. More, in many cases.<br /><br />If you have never treated yourself to the joy that is a Mallomar, go get yourself a box and revel in its perfection. You can only buy them during fall and winter, so get them while you can.

review/summary: Sweet Treat
review/text: Mallomars, a cookie I remember from my childhood and have not had one in many years; I enjoyed them as well as a lot of other cookies and was looking forward to opening this package when it arrived.<br />First impression on opening the box was the appearance.  It did not look too appetizing at first glance.  The dark chocolate coating was spotted over 50 percent with a tan color, not the deep dark chocolate color shown on the outer cover of the box.  About every third cookie had separated the cracker part from the creamy half.  And about a quarter of them sported cracked tops with the white showing through. Like everything else nowadays, the cookie is smaller than the original I remember.<br />So far, not too appetizing, but hey, I eat broken cookies all the time, however the spotted coating reminded me of candy that was improperly stored.<br />So I popped one in my mouth.<br />My first impression as I chewed a Mallomars cookie. A very sweet treat just like I remembered from years ago.  Despite the discoloration the chocolate flavor was acceptable but not that rich dark chocolate taste my mouth was watering for from the picture on the box.  The cracker portion was dry but soon combined with the marshmallow filling while chewing.  After three I found them too sweet to have more at one sitting.<br />Overall, the taste was a four star.  However, appearance of food is a big part of eating and tasting.  The box of Mallomars I received did not make the cookie appear appetizing.  If I had purchased it in a store I would have returned it.<br />Overall I can only give it 3 stars.

review/text: A little battered from the travel, these went (as the title suggests) very quickly. The sad thing is that the kids were never aware of their existence. I had two (TWO!) while making dinner, the man had another two or three before eating dinner, and we polished off all but two throughout the night. Those remaining two were my breakfast this morning. The package was a cookie-dusted mess when I opened it up, and the cookies were separated from the marshmallow (spoiler alert!), but they were just as good as the last time I had them, about 20 years ago.

Three stars or less.<br /><br />But, hey, a Mallomar has that just-right crunch cookie and pillowy soft topping and, oh, that chocolate ... ecstasy for the mouth, and who cares about the toxic ingredients when we're talking a great escape by overdosing on emotional eating. Yummy! Folks have been indulging on this cookie for 90 years and going strong; just wonder why consumers outside the Big Apple region, who are 70 percent of the Mallomar regulars, haven't been more enthusiastic about this ultimate comfort staple?

review/summary: Mallomars are my favorite cookie. But mail ordering them has its problems.
review/text: Mallomars are my favorite cookie. But mail ordering them has its problems.<br /><br />I love the combination or dark chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie that is a Mallomar. The taste combination is wonderful. Like Oreo sandwich cookies, aficionados tend to develop ritualistic ways of eating them. Do you nibble off the chocolate dome? You do bit through all three layers? Do you pull off the cookie bottom first? Any way you eat it, Mallomars are a great cookie.<br /><br />Ordering them mail order is not the best way to get them. They are a fragile cookie and are very temperature (heat and cold) sensitive. The ones I received were fresh, but a little banged up. The slight white coating on the chocolate typically means they were subject to cold. They were not melted at least. Melting kills a Mallomar, which is why they are not sold during the warmer months.<br /><br />If you can't find them locally (they are seasonal and regional), then ordering them makes sense. Otherwise, it's best to buy them locally.

review/summary: Better to pick them up at the store
review/text: I had never had Mallomars before so I couldn't resist tasting them.  These are definately delicious cookies.  The cookie part is sort of like a chocolate chip cookie without the chips and then there is marshmallow and chocolate coating.  Very good.  But they are fairly fragile cookies.  They fall apart a bit when you take a bite and since these were shipped to me, half were already falling apart before I could take any bites.

review/summary: Great cookie!
review/text: Marshmallow on a cookie base, covered in chocolate. Whoever thought up Mallomars came up with a real winner! How can you go wrong with that combination, plus the expertise of Nabisco making them? The answer to that obvious question is ; you can't!  One of the best treats around, hands down! Very well packaged too. They were very fresh, something that is vital to any treat in general but especially one with marshmallow. Stale marshmallow is NOT good!  The only problem I had with these is that I could not leave them alone...until they were gone!

review/summary: What a real treat ! ! !
review/text: These cookies are some of the best I have ever tried. It takes me back to when I was a kid and there were cookies that were similar with the marshmallow, etc., but I have never been able to find them since. With these cookies, I ration them to myself and each evening, I allow myself one as a treat!  The quality is exceptional and the darker chocolate is just the right taste of richness. Anytime I see these, I will buy them. I hope they will be available near to where I live. Super cookie treat ! ! !!

review/summary: So crazy good, who knew?
review/text: I'm not a huge cookie fan, give me a flaky strudel or some dark chocolates and don't blink or they will be gone but cookies tend to stay safe near me. Of course I have a 7yr old and no cookie is safe near her. On a typical shopping trip one day I told her she could pick out any cookies she wanted. What child doesn't love chocolate and marshmellows? She choose the Mallomars and I added them to my cart and didn't think much of it.<br /><br />At home that evening she had one and was gushing over how "awesome the cookie is Mommy", again... she's 7.... anything with chocolate and marshmellow is awesome to her. Then my husband came home and the smile on his face when he saw the bright yellow box was huge. He said he hasn't had them in years and that I simply must taste one. Thinking they were both being a bit dramatic I ate one. One box that is. OH MY GOD. Again, I don't like cookies, but I love these. I seriously am ashamed to admit I bought oh, 10 boxes when I heard they were seasonal that first year. I was addicted to these darn things.<br /><br />If you haven't had one, do it. Go ahead and buy at least a couple packages of 4 though... trust me on this.

review/text: Ok - I have to admit, I'd never had a mallomar before. I know, they've been around longer than my grandparents - but this was a first for me.<br />Um - YUM! The chocoholic in me loved the rich dark chocolate (very flavorful). It has just enough marshmallow and the cookie was perfect, not to dry or crumbly.<br />These are packaged well and even though the box was dented when arrived, none of the cookies were damaged and they tasted very fresh.

review/summary: Mmm Is for Mallomars
review/text: Yes, C is for cookie, but Mmmm is for Mallomars, and that's good enough for me! I used to love to eat Mallomars when I was a kid growing up in New York City. I hadn't had one for years--probably decades--till I ordered a box through Amazon.<br /><br />Look, it's not whole grain, it's not nutritious, it doesn't have pomegranate juice or a�ai--probably not even enough antioxidants from the dark chocolate covering to protect the heart of an amoeba. But it is good.<br /><br />I decided that when I did my taste test, the first thing I would notice was whether it had a "pure chocolate" taste or not. After all, it's printed right there on the box: "Pure Chocolate Mallomars." I expected to get that chemical aftertaste of highly processed chocolate you often get in lower-priced products. I have to say it was a good, pure chocolate taste. I tasted the chocolate, I felt the familiar squish of the marshmallow in my mouth, I felt the slight crunch of the base-layer cookie, swirled it around in my mouth (little or no chewing necessary), and then gulped it down.<br /><br />Not satisfied that I had actually done the taste test justice, I decided to try it again.<br /><br />Same thing. Good tasting for a little snack. I had to try it just one more time just to make sure. Yep, it was still good the third time.<br /><br />Recommended, but not nutritious. The one complaint I have is that about 4 or 5 of the cookies had split during shipping, somewhere along the way. The bottom wafer had come apart from the covered-marshmallow part, either mostly or entirely separated from the larger part of the snack. They should figure that one out. Although it still tasted good, I think people like to see their cookies intact when they open the package.

review/text: This was my first taste of a Mallomar although I have heard of them for many years, I don't remember every seeing them before. I thought the chocolate covering was a bit to dark and bitter as my preference is for milk chocolate. My husband however, likes dark chocolate and wolfed the rest of the package down. So how you feel about these cookies, would depend on how you like your chocolate.

review/text: I was excited to try a favorite treat from my past with the delivery of a box of Mallomars. I was not disappointed. The marshmallow center was just as I remembered; fluffy, soft, creamy and yummy. The chocolate flavor was also very good. Marshmallow, chocolate and a "spongy" cookie is always a great combination. I also like their bit size, only problem is that it is hard to stop eating them. I almost finished off the box all by myself. My only criticism is the nearly (current) $6 a box price.

review/summary: You got Mallomars, the greatest cookies of all time.
review/text: In the movie <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001Q556QG">When Harry Met Sally</a> we really get a feel for living in New York. Brownstones, Katz's Deli, Central Park. Leading up to the final scene at New Years, Harry is alone: "What so bad about this? You got Dick Clark, that's tradition. You got Mallomars, the greatest cookies of all time." It's a good line because this New York treat -- and 70% of them are sold in New York, according to the New York Times -- is only available in the winter. And it's a good line because they are the greatest cookies of all time.<br /><br />The same 2005 NYT piece described the "beloved" Mallomars as "about the diameter of a medium-size man's watch, with a beret-shaped marshmallow sitting atop a vanilla cookie. The whole thing is covered in chocolate." In England you can eat a similar thing as the Tunnock Chocolate Teacake. The pure chocolate is the supposed reason for them only being available during the cold winter months. If you like marshmallow and chocolate, you'll love Mallomars. And thanks to Amazon, we can all now enjoy them without travelling to JFK airport in the winter. Yum!

review/summary: Chocolate is great -- cookie crumbly
review/text: Apparently, I have been raised on the generic version of Mallomars, because this is the first time I have tried Mallomars.  At first look, I did notice they were smaller -- maybe about the size of the covered oreo cookies.  The marshmallow doesn't taste as sweet as the generic I've eaten for years and the cookie part seemed to crumble every time I would take a bite. So, I either dealt with the messy crumbs or shoved the whole cookie in my mouth at one time.  As an adult, when I splurge and eat cookies, I want to savor them and make them last longer, so I prefer not to put the whole thing in my mouth.  All that said, the chocolate on the Mallomars is out of this world!!!  It is fantastic!!!  I think the goodness of the chocolate almost completely counteracts the crumbly cookie.  Yummy!!

review/summary: Cookie as Promised but Delivery an Issue
review/text: When I receive a product via the Vine Program, I consider not just the product itself but the selling of it here on Amazon. Usually this isn't an issue but with food it can be an important consideration.  This is the case for this Mallomars.<br /><br />I remember Mallomars back from my years in NYC and these tasted better than my memories of them.  The marshmallow was soft and sweet but not overly so.  The cookie was a bit bland and easily separated from the rest of the treat.  The chocolate seemed to be on the darker side even though it was labeled "sweet" on the ingredients list.<br /><br />However, these 18 cookies also came broken and damaged from their shipment via Amazon.  Several were simply separated into bottom graham section and top marshmallow section, it was so obvious through the unopened clear plastic.  Several also had signs of fat bloom which happens when chocolate is not stored under proper temperatures; it looks like a discolored section, generally much lighter than other chocolate.  A lot of folks say it doesn't taste different but I think it has a slight grainy texture and a less cocoa flavor.<br /><br />If you like marshmallows, graham cookies, and chocolate, you should check these out but only if you buy them in a store you know will house them properly until you get them.  At that point it will be up to you to prevent either fat or sugar bloom.

review/text: The Mallomars arrived to the great joy of my kids and wife.  I personally do not like marshmallow cookies, and think S'mores are often really messy but a traditional campfire necessity.<br /><br />All my kids enjoyed the cookies and thought they were wonderful.  I did try one and it had good flavor, and nice crisp cookie but I couldn't get past the marshmallow center.  However, don't let my aversion to the fluffy white stuff interfere with your snaking pleasure.  Grab a box or two and enjoy, I'm sure you will not be disappointed.

review/text: I had never seen this cookie but I had heard about it in movies. I ordered one box just to see if it was a good cookie and I am completely hooked.<br /><br />I took one serving which is 2 cookies at 120 calories, which is not that bad... but you cannot stop at 2 cookies. I decided to have 2 more and take a longer walk that planned.<br /><br />After the walk I wanted some more and they were gone! My husband loved them and he was very happy to see them as he used to eat them as a child.<br /><br />I recommend this cookie to anyone who likes dark chocolate, marshmallow and a cookie (graham style). But be careful because as soon as you open the package it will be gone!

review/text: I've not had Mallomars before and was looking forward to something similar to a s'more, I guess.  The cookies arrived in good shape; however, the chocolate coating was uneven and had turned slightly grayish white.  The whole thing (chocolate, cookie, and marshmallow) tasted primarily of marshmallow and the dry texture of the cookie gave the treat a slightly gritty feel on the tongue.<br /><br />On the whole, it was an okay sweet treat but not something that I care for.  I tried a couple and will throw the rest away. I don't know if the box I got was indicative of the cookie on a whole, but based on my box, I can't recommend the product.

review/summary: Bad Day At the Factory?
review/text: I have to say I was disappointed with this sample. The cookies were not a pleasing dark chocolate color as one might expect. The chocolate coating was a pale washed out brown color as if they had been subjected to extremes of temperature. The cookie part of the Mallomars was very dry and had started crumbling before I even opened the cellophane package. I do not know if this is typical of other samples sent out but this was certainly neither appealing nor appetizing. The outer packaging arrived in good shape so I do not think the problem was with the mailing. These were not the Mallomars I recalled enjoying from my youth. Based on this sampling, I certainly could not recommend these cookies.

review/summary: Absolutely the best cookie in the world
review/text: I am a native New Yorker. I grew up loving Mallomars. Much to my shock and surprise, this amazing delight is not known in some parts of the country. It turns out, if you read the box, that 70% of Mallomars are sold in the New York metropolitan area. Here is what the rest of you have been missing. A mallomar is a round cookie with a blob of marshmellow on top and then covered with a semi-sweet chocolate shell. You may not like marshmellows; you may not even like the cookie, but the combination is pure magic!  It's without question, one of the most addicting treats I have ever eaten.<br /><br />New Yorkers don't need me to tell them this. But then they don't have to go to Amazon to order them. Mallomars are available in supermarkets there. You can't find them where I live now. But happily they are available right here. I have eaten through my first shipment (a gift from my wife) and I am now ordering a refill. Amazon ships them fresh and well protected. All the cookies arrived in perfect condition.<br /><br />Excuse me, I need to go open another box.

review/summary: + 1/2 star: rather good--as long as you get a fresh batch, that is
review/text: For as long as I can remember, Mallomars have been in my family's home about this time of the year. I love the crunch of the cookie mixed with the soft, marshmallow type filling and that chocolate coating. Yum!<br /><br />They may not be a healthy snack; but nonetheless they are delicious--and great for a quick sugar "pick me up." They just plain taste good--that is, as long as you open the box to find that you have fresh Mallomars inside. It's a hit or miss thing here; most of the time these cookies are wonderfully fresh but every so often you get cookies that are going stale--and in my experience when the cookies begin to go stale the chocolate covering turns a lighter color, too.<br /><br />The particular box I got from Amazon was only somewhat fresh; and it was so poorly packaged that most of the cookies had broken into pieces with crumbs getting all over the place--that's not the way I am used to Amazon packing things for shipment!<br /><br />I have nothing against the Mallomars cookies themselves. However, the cookies just aren't invariably fresh.<br /><br />Here's hoping you DO enjoy fresh Mallomars!

review/summary: LOVE Mallowmars, just not this box
review/text: I have been a Mallomar fan since I was a kid.  They were always a special treat that we truly enjoyed.  Honestly, I don't know if this is a new formula, if they changed any ingredients, or cut back on using tastier ingredients.  Upon opening this box, I could see that something was amiss.  They weren't as dark as I recall, almost looking aged, or old, although that's really not possible since production only starts up in the fall.  My first bite was also a disappointment.  I couldn't really taste the chocolate, or the marshmallow.  The graham cracker tasted awful and was a lot dryer than I remember.  Some of the cookies were broken and separated from the graham cracker.  I will be purchasing a box locally to see if production has declined or if I just received a bad box.  I'll post back with my findings.<br /><br />EDIT:  Purchased a box yesterday at Shoprite and the first cookie out was mouth watering, as it should be.  Perfect blend of chocolate, marshmallow, & graham crackers that I remember.  This indeed was just a bad box...

review/text: Do you like chocolate? Do you like marshmallows? Yeah, me too! I love mallomars! I hadn't had one in a long time when I received this package. Lets just say they didn't last long in my house. They were very fresh and the cookies were not broken even for being delivered in the mail. They taste fantastic.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Mallomars cookies are pretty yummy - a slightly spicy cookie base, with fluffy marshmallow on top, covered with dark chocolate. I've never been a great fan of smores, but I gave a cookie to one of my son's friends, who said it tasted just like a smore. Although she wasn't that keen on the after taste (she's not a fan of dark chocolate).<br /><br />My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the entire contents of the package arrived broken/smashed. Clearly the packaging provided by Amazon to protect it in transit was insufficient for the rigors of transit.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'd highly recommend these cookies :)

review/text: I have memories of my dad eating mallomars and I think it was my little brother's first big word, as in "Please pass the mallomars..." These were just as I remembered. They crumble a little if you try and take a bite instead of popping the entire cookie in your mouth. The marshmellow was soft and chocolate, just right. I would recommend these to others.

review/summary: My favorite cookie
review/text: Mallomars may be the one thing that makes winter worth while -- I can't get these in the summer for some reason. (I've been told the chocolate melts.) The tactile effect (in one's mouth) of a Mallomar is similar to that of vanilla soft serve ice cream dipped quickly in chocolate: thin chocolate crust, soft substance inside, on top of a cone. A Mallomar substitutes marshmallow on top of a vanilla cookie, with a dark chocolate outside. If you like milk chocolate, then of course buy Pinwheels. But a Mallomar isn't too sweet, isn't too big, and awesome with milk. I keep mine in the refrigerator. Yum.

review/summary: Chocolate + Marshmallows = YUMMY!
review/text: It's really for those who love chocolate, who love marshmallows, put those together and you get Mallomars! It's a delicious combination of flavors, you get the milky chocolates, very thin layer but just enough to cover the gooey white marshmallow feeling inside. And there's a bit of light crispy/crunch to the chocolate layer too...so it's a good bite, you will want to savor the taste in your mouth a bit :) Let it rest on your tongue and taste the soft textures.<br /><br />I've never had MalloMars before, but heard of them and am glad to finally have tried them, very yummy taste! It's great with something to drink, like milk :) Definitely a treat for those days you're getting that sweet-tooth feeling! I don't know about the calories or sugar factor, but it's a wonderful bite of yumminess!<br /><br />A+ Recommended

review/text: I was excited to try this cookie because Billy Crystal's character calls it the "best cookie ever" in the iconic "When Harry Met Sally," which is one of my favorite films ever.<br /><br />The cookie does not disappoint.  It's rich with chocolate, gooey with marshmallow, and crunchy with vanilla sandwich cookie on the bottom.  Messy, lots of crumbs and pretty darned good.  A Mallomar is a terrific treat for late-night snacking while watching Turner Classic Movies.<br /><br />Recommended.

review/summary: Tasty Treat, but not for Binge Eating!
review/text: I had heard of from TV and movie dialogue, but never eaten, Mallomars ever since my childhood, but had never eaten one or even seen anyone eating them in the Central Illinois communities I grew up in, so when I had the opportunity to try some through Amazon, I was intrigued.<br /><br />After eating through an entire box, I'd have to say that the taste is very reminiscent of "Smores", with that mix of Graham Cracker, Chocolate and Marshmallows, but with a much "lighter" texture than you'd get from Home made smores.  The marshmallows are very puffy and light, and its easy to eat one or two as frankly, while the taste is potent, the snack itself isn't really "filling".<br /><br />That potency of taste makes for a great "flavor rush", but it also means that even if you're hungry, you're probably not going to eat more than a few at a time.  That's good if you're trying to stay on a diet, but if you're one of those "throw caution to the wind and eat a bag of cookies" types, this is not for you.<br /><br />So, great taste, good for dieting (for me anyway), but definitely not something that you're going to eat a lot of at any one time.

review/summary: Too sweet for me
review/text: These Mallomars pack a lot of sugar. They do have a chocolate taste. But the marshmallow taste overwhelms the more subtle chocolate, so that I felt at first like I was spooning sugar into my mouth and chewing it. Needless to say, that is not a good taste for me.<br /><br />Before the box was gone, I got more used to the sugar explosion, and the cookies tasted better. But that's not a good thing. Better to avoid this kind of treat. It's not good to like sugar.

review/summary: Five star cookie, one star example
review/text: Five star cookie:<br />Let me be clear, I love Mallomars and have done since the late 40's as a kid.  In fact, it's still my #2 favorite commercial cookie (behind the now unavailable Mother's Iced Raisin Cook ... ohhhhh momma!). I've been known to buy out the total supply of our local Kroger's which ordered them as a special request item and started stocking them intermittently.  It's the See's candy of cookies in it's fresh version.<br /><br />1 Star sample:<br />Unfortunately the sample I received for review under the Amazon Vine program did not measure up.  They were clearly old, white filmed chocolate, powdery cookie, most of them had fallen apart and the marshmallow was rubbery.  What a disappointment.  I can only imagine the frustration if I'd have paid for them and had 4 boxes delivered like this.<br /><br />While I can't recommend Mallomars highly enough, I'd suggest obtaining them from a local store.  They aren't available everywhere year-round but during the cooler months they make it out to California so they should be available in most decent sized urban areas at least.<br /><br />I've had mixed results with grocery items from Amazon and with a Prime membership and 2nd day air automatic one can only assume that there is a problem in storage or logistics somewhere.  At the premium price asked you might want to make some Toll House cookies and let it go at that.

review/summary: Cookie on the bottom tastes horrible.
review/text: My 7 year old took one bite of this product and then pushed the rest of the box to me and said I could have it. I was greatly surprised by this because chocolate and marshmellows are her 2 of her favorite ingredients. After taking a bite of the product myself, I understood her distaste of the product. Package-wise, the box didn't appear to be crushed at all and arrived looking like new. However, a majority of the cookies had separated somewhat to the cookie part. This product is a take on the Smores concept, however, it lacks the taste of a smores. The marshmallow is light and sweet, similar to frosting almost. The chocolate is ok, but it's only a very thin covering over each cookie. By far the worst issue w/ this cookie is the cookie portion. It tastes horrible, looks and tastes like sawdust.<br /><br />I would never purchase this product and would not recommend it.

review/summary: Chocolate, marshmallow and cookie; what's not to love?
review/text: Mallomars have been one of my favorite sweets for years. I have always liked the combination of marshmallow and chocolate--delicious every time. The addition of a cookie adds even more to the taste and texture. They have a decadent--but not too rich--soft chocolate taste that leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />For cookies, they aren't terribly unhealthy. There's no cholesterol or trans fats, and they have pretty low sodium (40 mg). They do, however, use high fructose corn syrup--though it's not as high in the ingredient list as in many other sweets.<br /><br />They got a little shook up during shipping, so about four of the eighteen cookies crumbled apart; the cookie separated from the marshmallow topping.<br /><br />We went through the box in three days--I'm surprised it lasted that long.<br /><br />If you haven't tried these classic goodies, get some now--you'll be hooked!

review/text: Mallomars are plump pillows of marshmallow atop a graham cracker cookie, enrobed in dark chocolate and they are nothing less than yummy.  With those ingredients, "s'mores" may come to mind, and they are very similar.<br /><br />The history of the cookie may be the most interesting part. Originated in 1913, they are a favorite in New York City -- 70% of all sales come from that one city. And unlike almost any other cookie, they are only produced seasonally -- October through April, presumably because chocolate suffers in warm weather.<br /><br />If you like s'mores, or Moon Pies, or Nabisco's similar product called Pinwheels, you'll like Mallomars. Cookie. Marshmallow. Chocolate. What's not to love?

review/summary: Ahh......The Sweet Memories of Childhood
review/text: When I saw these, I just knew I had to get them. I loved them when I was a child growing up in New England and they were a special treat that my mother let me have several times a year. I actually bought them through college and I don't think I have had them since. I moved around the country, and these were one of those items that isn't available in many regions, so I sort of forgot about them.<br /><br />I tore into these when they arrived and savored every one of them. My wife was a little put off that I wouldn't share, but she was understanding when she realized that I hadn't had them in years. They are just as I remember them. The chocolate gently coats the marshmallow and cookie. The flavor mix is perfect. It is sweet, but not so sweet as to be cloying. All of the ingredients work in perfect harmony.<br /><br />If you have never had these, give them a try, as they are fabulous. I know I will be ordering more soon!

review/summary: delightful cookie .... but very crumbly
review/text: I've heard people for years rave about Malomars, so how could I resist tasting what all the fuss was about? First made in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1913 (now made in Canada), the package states that 70% of these cookies are sold "in the shadow of the Big Apple". Eighteen cookies in the carton, 2 cookies per serving at 120 calories, 5g of fat; unfortunately there's high fructose corn syrup, so I won't buy more.<br /><br />The cookie itself? A B+ in my book. There's a good sweet dark chocolate shell around a fluff of marshmallow atop a cookie. The chocolate and marshmallow are very good together. The cookie has a good flavor but is overpowered by the other two, and it crumbles too much -- I always wind up sprinkled with crumbs; at the end there's a slightly salt finish. Very nice. I can see why people like these, but I'd probably take an Oreo first.

review/text: I haven't had a Mallomar cookie in at least 30 years - probably more like 40. Most foods that we enjoyed in our youth lose some of their appeal when we taste them again years later. That's not a worry here. These were as good as I remembered them. The milk chocolate shell is sweet and brittle, the marshmallow is soft and deliciously firm, the graham cracker is flaky and crisp.<br /><br />Like some of the other reviewers, some of my cookies were separating from their graham cracker bases. This didn't affect the flavor.<br /><br />I don't let price affect my rating because prices can change over time, sales come and go, and your idea of value may not be the same as mine. However, the current price here, which exceeds 20 bucks for 4 boxes, seems extreme.

The cookies contain high fructose corn syrup, and corn syrup, in addition to plenty of sugar. They have "pure chocolate," whatever that means, and it is true that the chocolate coating does taste real, though it has a fair amount of sugar mixed in. The cookies do not have much in the way of vitamins or minerals, though 2 cookies do at least contribute 4% to your daily iron requirements. The fat is canola, palm, or palm kernel oil, plus the cocoa butter present in the chocolate.

review/summary: Real chocolate makes a huge difference.
review/text: It's hard to believe, but I had never had a Mallomar until this late in my life. I wasn't aware of its history (something I brushed up when I learned more about it) or it's limited distribution (fall and winter only). To be absolutely honest, my first reaction to them was one of disappointment. I like chocolate, cookies and marshmallow enough, but I didn't see what the fuss was about. My wife and daughter seemed to be loving them though, so I gave it another shot, and I think my problem was that I just basically inhaled the first cookie, so it registered as mostly marshmallow with the chocolate only faintly registering. That's the wrong way to go about it. This is something to be savored, at least so long as real chocolate is in the mix (and trust me "real chocolate" is something quickly disappearing from a ton of chocolatey snacks everywhere and one of the biggest reasons why things never "taste like they used to").<br /><br />Even though I've never had them before, I would imagine that Mallomars are one cookie that tastes pretty much the way it always has. When you take the time to notice, it's very apparent that this is real chocolate here. It's rich, flavorful and melts in your mouth. I'm used to the chocolate on cookies to be more of a "waxy" consistency, but not here. It's smooth and starts to melt almost as quickly as it's in your mouth. The graham cracker wafer isn't bad and the soft, billowing marshmallow is good too, but this is definitely a taste that's more than the sum of its parts. I'd definitely give Mallomars another go if faced with them at the grocery store.

review/summary: If at first they don't taste good...
review/text: I think I first heard about Mallomars from Babysitters Club books when I was a kid. Maybe they were one of the foods Claudia stashed in her room? She was always eating brand name junk food my mother wouldn't buy me. So I was really looking forward to these cookies. If a fictional character from my childhood loved them, they have to be delicious, right?<br /><br />I did not love these cookies at first bite. They seemed dry and I didn't like that the chocolate was a thin hard shell. I also wasn't remotely hungry when I first tried them. Although I really did like the marshmallow. Also, the packaging isn't very storage friendly. But I figure that's what tupperware and plastic bags are for.<br /><br />Then I came home from work one night, hungry. They were pretty satisfying, and the more I ate the more I loved that the outer shell of chocolate was crisp. Now I only have two left. I think I'll go eat them right now...

A nice marketing move but is that really necessary or is it simply the way it maintains interest?  I don't mean to offend those who love this cookie.

review/summary: Delicious Seasonal Treat
review/text: Available only in the Fall and Winter, Mallomars are a seasonable favorite that fans snap up when they are on store shelves, often refrigerating or freezing them to snack on when they aren't available in stores. Mallomars consist of a round graham cracker, with marshmallow on top, and then covered in pure chocolate (the chocolate is the reason Nabisco gives for only selling Mallomars in the Fall and Winter - they claim the chocolate will melt on store shelves or in transport during the warmer months). Two cookies equal 120 calories.<br /><br />Although we don't go so far as stockpiling them, Mallomars are a favorite in my family. The combination of chocolate, marshmallow, and graham cracker is perfect. Although the marshmallow is by far the most prominent taste, it is not overwhelming. The chocolate is delicious and the graham crackers are nice and soft. The cookies have a nice light taste, so they don't sit heavy in your stomach (they are round and about the size of a silver dollar but very satisfying). I also like the fact that they aren't loaded with calories or cholesterol (the saturated fat - serving size two cookies - is 15% Daily Value and the sodium is 2% Daily Value).<br /><br />Mallomars are a delicious seasonal treat.

review/summary: Pretty good cookie
review/text: To be honest, I'm not a big sweets or cookie eater. But these sounded good for the occasional indulgence.<br /><br />Being a Californian, the winter cookie I grew up with was the Pinwheel. Same basic components, but larger in diameter with a hole down the middle, a higher marshmallow-to-cookie ratio, and a vaguely pinwheel shape. It was my father's favorite cookie. So it is probably no surprise that I find Mallomars slightly deficient compared to the mighty Pinwheel. They are, nonetheless, pretty good, and actually easier to eat. Being smaller, there is less commitment with a Mallomar than with a Pinwheel. On the other hand, one might not be enough, making it harder to say you limited yourself to one cookie.

review/summary: Mallomars
review/text: I loved these cookies as a child. The box I received as a Vine reviewer was a little stale though. The chocolate crumbled like it had been refrigerated- an issue with shipping I assume. Some of the cookies had lost their graham cracker bottom in the box.  While still enjoyable, the cookies were not quite as tasty as I remembered them.

review/summary: Good Cookie
review/text: Mallomars Pure Chocolate Cookies are the classic cookie on marshmallow covered in chocolate. There are as many variations as there are cookie companies. If you enjoy sweets you pretty much can't go wrong with these. The marshmallow was fresh, the cookie was crunchy and the experience, on the whole was pleasant enough. The reason I deducted one star was the quality of the chocolate coating. Instead of unctuous creamy chocolate experience, the shell was hard and shattered when I took a byte. The chocolate also had a slight bitterness that did not pair as well as it could have with the other ingredients. These are good cookies, but for my taste, could be a little better.

review/summary: Nothing to stand out at all
review/text: I admit that while the structure of this cookie seems familiar, I'm not particularly acquainted with "Mallomars". Now, to start with, I'm a cookie lover, a marshmallow lover, and a chocolate lover. This has all three -- they are practically s'mores with cookies instead of graham crackers. But eating them I can't help but feel like they are just really in 'average' department. The mallow part is somewhat tough, and there's only a thin layer of chocolate. I like the cookie part, but it's not enough to give the whole thing a higher rating -- especially as it's pretty expensive (over $5 for an 8 oz box) and though it's a small nitpick, it's hard to recommend anything, especially something meant as a snack and already high in calories, with high fructose corn syrup in it.<br /><br />Maybe if they were a bit healthier and tasted a bit less....processed....I'd give it higher marks. But not with all the factors in play.

review/summary: One sweet cookie
review/text: While one cookie is only 60 calories, the first thing you notice is that they are very, very sugary.  This is borne out by the ingredients, which are indicated in the next paragraph.  The dark chocolate coating is noticeable, but I personally would have preferred a thicker coating.  I suspect that the package was exposed to some type of weather because parts of the dark brown coating were pale brown, which normally happens to chocolate when it is frozen.  This does not affect taste but does detract from appearance. The cookie is crumbly; in fact, many of them in the package were in pieces or stuck together so as to break when separated.  The marshmallow part is soft and melts in your mouth.<br /><br />The ingredients, in order are:  sweet chocolate coating (sugar, chocolate, cocoa butter, chocolate processed with alkali and soy lecithin - an emulsifier, milk), enriched flour (wheat flour, niacin, reduced iron, vitamins B1 and B2, folic acid), sugar, high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, canola and/or palm and/or palm kernel oil, invert sugar, water, gelatin, leavening (baking soda, calcium phosphate), salt, soy lecithin (emulsifier), artificial flavor.  Amazingly, the cholesterol is 0 mg.

review/summary: Brought back childhood memories
review/text: I remember eating Mallomars as a child, but have never seen them in the supermarkets in recent years so it was a great pleasure to obtain them through the Vine program.  They taste as good now, 50 years later, as they did when I was 10.  Wonderful marshmellow, smooth chocolate made it hard to stop eating after the first two, but calories do count so I asked a friend to keep them in her apartment so I couldn't eat the entire box.

review/text: I can remember getting these in my lunchbox as a child.  That was the only good thing about going back to school in the autumn.  To bite into the rich, decadent, chocolate shell to find the crisp cookie and fluffy, creamy marshmallow was a looked for treat.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that they haven't changed the recipe too much in the last thirty years.  I don't have any complaints or problems with this product, except the box seemed to empty too fast.

review/summary: I thought these were better than the Mallomars I remember as a kid.
review/text: Mallomars are like smores but better.  There is a graham cracker base which is topped with marshmallow. Then the entire cookie is dipped in dark chocolate. I personally don't like smores and I love these cookies.<br /><br />My mom used to love this type of cookie. I remember them being much bigger.  I don't know if the portions are now smaller or that I'm just bigger and they look smaller.  Either way, that is not a bad thing considering this is a cookie and not the healthiest thing to eat in excess. However, they do have dark chocolate on them...so they might be better than other cookies on the market.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed in the cookies.  The entire family loved them. Nobody in the household, besides myself, have had Mallomars before.  My husband doesn't care for any cookie that is hard and liked the fact that the graham cracker portion was soft.<br /><br />At the right price point, I'd buy them on occasion.  If you like marshmallows or smores, you should enjoy this cookie.  There is no reason not to give them 5 stars but they aren't my most favorite cookie and I reserve the last star for that cookie. :D

review/summary: quite good, much better than I remembered
review/text: I used to get these when I was a child but had not had any for years. I thought of them as being a  treat for children but these were rather more sophisticated than I recalled. The chocolate coating is a very dark chocolate with a nice, slightly bitter edge. The coating made  a lovely contrast  with the soft, tender, sweet marshmallow. The marshmallow was not overly sweet and was very tender it almost melted in the mouth rather than requiring lots of bouncy chewing as some marshmallow based products do.  the cookie base  reminded me slightly of  graham crackers.  The whole effect was more subtle and grownup  than s'mores or Whoopie Pies. The only negative is that many of the cookies arrived cracked or broken  but that ay be because the postal worker had managed to jam the package into my small mail box even though it did not fit.  As a vine member I got one box packed in a padded envelope, the actual  set of four  that one would order is very likely placed in a box and would probably stand up to shipping much better.

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: These cookies don't travel well.  Mine came in a box without any extra cushion and about half the cookies crumbled.  Well, at least the bottoms did.  The bottom layer is disc of crumbly cookie, like a graham cracker, only it doesn't taste like one.  Next comes a big dollop of marshmallow and the whole thing is covered in a tasty hard chocolate.  You really need to experience the entire cookie in its many layers to appreciate it.  Removing one of the crumbled bottom layers covered in chocolate and popping it in my mouth didn't do a thing for me.  But, sinking my teeth through a whole cookie allowed me to experience all the flavors together.  And, I must say, these babies are addictive.  I've never tasted one before, but now I'll have to put blinders on when I pass by them in the store.<br /><br />They still need to work on the shipping issues.  If they figure out how to get them to the consumer without them breaking and leaving crumbs all over, you won't be sorry you ordered these. Minus one star for shipping issues.

review/summary: Chocolate makes the treat.
review/text: The temptation with a mallomar is to critique the one as three, the cookie and then the marshmallow and then the chocolate, as if three cookies stepped out of a bar together, and were in fact Larry, Curly, Moe, rather than the three stooges of cookiedom.<br /><br />To see the mallomar as parts, not a whole, as separable, like the Oreo, as split into segments, is to diminish the mallomar.  This is philosophical reductionism, the sort of analysis that leads a sloppy thinker to believe that a material element explains the spiritual, that science explains experience, that what a man thinks encompasses what a man does.<br /><br />The mallomar stands athwart these modernistic tendencies with a traditional meld of flavors, a completeness.<br /><br />The headline of this review was written during a weak moment, a moment when a nibble was made, the edge tasted, and the chocolate found exceptional.  This shallow and specious moment, I preserve in the headline, to show that fateful reduction in essay form is a failing, unlike in the making of a sauce, where reduction is a tool.<br /><br />Mallomars cannot be reduced.  They are one, and the best way to eat one is to take a larger bite, to get marshmallow, cookie, and chocolate in a grasp and a gasp of flavor.<br /><br />Long live mallomars!.  As a midwestern person, I often cannot find them in my grocer, and this is a shame.  A shame.<br /><br />Even better with milk.

review/summary: Yummy but very light
review/text: These marshmallow treats are delicious. They're kind of like a light Smore, with graham cracker, chocolate, and marshmallow. The marshmallow is definitely the dominate flavor and most of the cookie is marshmallow, with chocolate coating and a thin graham cracker bottom. I think they taste great. However, they're also a bit dangerous. Because they're mostly marshmallow, they feel light and are very satiating. It's almost like eating a marshmallow with a lot of extra sugar on top. If you're at all concerned about your diet, I'd definitely stay away!

review/summary: Some Things Never Change!
review/text: When Amazon offered me a free box of Mallomars Cookies, my reaction was, "Yes!"  I love Mallomars and I know I always will.<br /><br />To begin with, I have always had a thing for Chocolate covered Marshmallows.  I don't know why, but for the past several years, Chocolate covered Marshmallow candy only seems to appear during holiday seasons, usually around Christmas and Easter.  You used to be able to buy such sweets all year.  I just noticed that the advertising for Mallomars says they're only available in the fall; all I know is I can hardly ever find them when the urge strikes me.  I've been looking for some at the supermarket for weeks, but I haven't seen any.<br /><br />Besides the delicious Chocolate covered Marshmallow topping, at the bottom of each Mallomar is a delicious little shortbread cookie, that stays on the tongue for a while after the Chocolate is gone.  Just as I remember them from my remote childhood, Mallomars are a comfort food I still love to indulge in, like my mother's Spaghetti Sauce or Home-made Soup.<br /><br />Some things never change.  That's a fact of life.  But once in a while, that can be a good thing.  Mallomars haven't changed a bit since I was a boy.  Get some.<br /><br />I got the box today and it's more than half gone - what does that tell you?  Oh well; I can always order more from Amazon!<br /><br />PS -- After posting this review, I see some people were less than satisfied with their free samples; the cookie came apart from some of the Marshmallows.  Wonderful!  I wish mine did that; I'd love to sample the cookie without the Chocolate covered Marshmallow, just for the heck of it.  When I got my box in the mail, I put them in the refrigerator, expecting that the shipping may have warped them or melted the Chocolate.  When I took them out of the refrigerator, an hour later, and opened the box, they were perfect.  Just like I remembered.  Sorry if you got a bad shipment.  Mine were G-O-O-O-O-O-D!

review/summary: Very good despite being crushed
review/text: Mallowmars are always a welcome treat and this box of mallowmars arrived in the worst shape possible.  Unfortunately, the box was mailed in soft exterior packaging with no "notice" on the packaging to not crush or bend.  It was stuffed inside my mailbox == had to be bent to fit -- and it was obvious that heavy items had sat on it in the mail truck at some point.  When I opened the beat up box, every cookie was broken in some manner. Some had been stressed so badly that the marshmallow section had separated completely from the cookie dough part!  Despite their having taken a beating, the cookies were still edible and we enjoyed them.  I do think that in the future when sending a product that is fragile == it would be more fair to the manufacturer to ship the product in a manner that it would arrive crushed and broken.<br /><br />I give credit to the manufacturer for good packaging -- the cellophane and the cookie box itself did not break.  It was bent and crumpled but it didn't tear and expose the product to air.

review/summary: Not really very memorable, that's for sure.
review/text: Since I don't spend much time in New York City I've obviously missed the Mallomars excitement which is supposed to grip the area each fall.  I had no idea I was requesting a legend when I clicked on that little box to chose these cookies.<br /><br />So-o-o, don't get me wrong here, I didn't like them a whole lot, but I also didn't hate them.  More or less a simple shrug of the shoulders.  Definitely not something I will be looking for in the grocery store.  A small graham cracker type cookie with a dollop of marshmallow on top then encased top to bottom with a dark chocolate. For me a three-bite treat, for my husband, two bites.  There was a *snap* when I bit into the treat, but that poor cookie was terribly dry and crumbly.  It's the chocolate coating which gives it that snap sound.  Three of the eighteen cookies in the package had come unstuck from their marshmallow so they weren't beautiful, but they certainly did taste the same as the others.  No cookies were broken otherwise or crushed.  The packaging seems to have held up very well since these traveled by SmartPost.  When enjoyed with a cup of hot tea this 60 calorie cookie was pleasant enough, but was not special for me.  Down here in the South we have a concoction known as a Moon Pie.  It has all the same elements, but in a larger size.  Even though I haven't had a Moon Pie in several years I can safely say these Mallomars have not tempted me away from my Southern roots.

review/summary: PURE CHOCOLATE MALLOMARS COOKIES
review/text: ~<br />This is a `3 for the price of 1' review because 3 people in my house actually had 3 different opinions.<br /><br />#1 tester did not think he liked them well enough to buy a whole box. He said that although it was tasty enough, the cookie's chocolate coating was hard and cracked into small pieces when he bit into it, the graham cracker-ish crust was too dry, and the cookie was too sweet to eat more than one at a time.<br /><br />#2 tester thought that they were very good (not great). He thought that they were a bit too sweet as well, but he (being a typical teenager) was able to polish off 3 or 4 with no difficulties.<br /><br />#3 tester was the most impressed. He thought that they were over the moon terrific. He loved the combination of the chocolate, the marshmallow fluff and the crust. With a tall glass of cold milk he was able to devour half a dozen of the sweet treats. (another teenager)<br /><br />I received an 8 oz box (18 cookies).  The packaging was fine; inside the box was a plastic tray with two rows of cookies. All of the cookies inside the box arrived in tact and looked beautiful.

review/summary: Not as awesome as I'd expected
review/text: I have friends who are raving fans of the Mallomars. I figured they'd be a big hit with me too. After all, there aren't very many junk foods that I don't like. If anything, I have impulse controls issues and have trouble stopping at just one of anything.<br /><br />So I was really surprised when I tried my first Mallomar yesterday. I expected to really have to restrain myself and avoid scarfing down a bunch of them. But no. One was enough. I had no desire to try another. I guess that's lucky for me, because at 60 calories each, these pack quite a payload.<br /><br />Hmmm. Maybe I was in a bad mood or there was a sampling issue. I can't honestly form an opinion on just one, so I tried another one a few hours later and then one more again today.<br /><br />I had the same feeling after every one of them: too much dark chocolate flavor. I like dark chocolate a lot, but these have a surprisingly long lasting dark chocolate aftertaste. The marshmallow inside is really first rate. Marshmallows can get stale and funky pretty easily (except for rock hard Easter peeps!). So yes, they really succeeded with the filling. The cookie was OK, but it didn't hold together very well. It tried to split vertically, which I expected, but it also delaminated horizontally and made a big mess. The cookie taste wasn't as good as I expected. It was fresh and buttery, but there was no sweet flavor or even any graham flavor. It was just a buttery shortbread taste (and messy).<br /><br />And besides the dark chocolate aftertaste, my other lasting impression was that the three tastes (chocolate, marshmallow, and cookie) really didn't marry very well in this treat. They don't combine into a distinct taste like a s'more or a moon pie. They're just three individual tastes. Or actually the marshmallow and the cookie are just delivery systems for the dark chocolate flavor.<br /><br />I've probably really made you mad by now if you're a Mallomar fan. It's fine with me if you like them: different strokes. I wish I could share the rest of my box with you.<br /><br />But if you DO like them, is Amazon the right place to buy them? My box of Mallomars had a pretty rough ride. The chocolate was marred pretty badly and at least one of them was damaged. I don't think the packaging from Nabisco is sufficient for shipping these by UPS or FedEx. I'm sure they do just fine on the regular truck to the grocery store, but freight shipping is a different experience. I'll post a link to a photo so you can see the condition of the contents.<br /><br />It's the cool autumn in Southern California right now, so the contents weren't melted. They would have been badly damaged during the hotter months.<br /><br />So there you have it. It's a treat that a junk food junkie like me can turn his back on. And it's a shopping experience that will probably be disappointing to real fans of this treat. I recommend you pass this item up.<br /><br />Check out the product photo that I posted.  It shows the condition of the cookies when they arrived.

review/summary: Zesty flavor, but watch the price!
review/text: I have bought more than six hundred of these at a discount store, and I have been eating them regularly.  It should be obvious that the only difference between the ramen flavors is the little flavor packets.  This flavor packet is a pretty zesty lime-citrus-salty flavor which is actually not as bad as you might think.  I usually use half the packet and throw in some curry and ginger, but that's just my preference.  Sometimes I will add a jalapeno or serano pepper that I sliced up into very thin pieces.<br /><br />So there must be many ways to enjoy ramen.  I only suggest that one watches the price.  I am happy to pay ten cents per packet at my discount store.  Otherwise it is seventeen cents at Walmart for chicken or beef flavor.  But even if the price is two bucks for twelve, it is still a great base for quick and easy meals.

review/summary: Leg Beautificain Deluxe
review/text: This product is advertised: In comparing with most mechanical kneading versions, the air massage is much less painful and much better for senior citizens, diabetes, and people with sensitive feet. This is the one reaseon that I bought this machine. The only way that I can use this machine is low intensity and ease. Forget about the physical therapy or leg beauty button. It hurts your legs even on these simple settings. My husband is listed as described above.  He can't use it at all because of the pain it causes.

review/summary: Sylvia's Squash Is Absolutely Scruptious!
review/text: Wow.  This is succulent, mouth-watering squash<br />flavored just right.  I'm addicted to it.  It is<br />my favorite vegetable side dish.  I'm almost afraid<br />to tell you how good it is because I fear you will<br />buy them all and not leave any for me.  A crazy<br />thought, but it did cross my mind.  If you're tired<br />of the same old boring green beans and corn and<br />are ready to delve into the 'Holy Grail' of veggie<br />side dishes, get you some Sylvia's Squash.

review/summary: Sylvia's squash and onions
review/text: I love the Sylvia's greens and when I ordered a case I decided to also order the squash which I had not tried. I thought the squash and onions would be as good.  I have been very disappointed and have not touched a second can.  Love the greens!!!!

review/summary: Watery; my least favorite Sylvia's food. Cook your own and you'll be much happier.
review/text: Let me start by saying that I love the other vegetables I've tried in this line. But, this is a total miss.<br /><br />I made my first purchases of Sylvia's through a link on her website to World Finer Foods, so I didn't buy the squash here on Amazon. I am here, though, to re-order my faves. (This squash isn't among them.)<br /><br />The can is almost all water. It states it serves 4, but there's only enough squash for one.  I wouldn't mind that much if it tasted good, but it doesn't. The squash is very mushy and the flavor just isn't there. I was able to enjoy it somewhat by adding my own seasonings and eating it with cheese bread to soak up the oniony water.<br /><br />Yellow squash and sweet onions aren't hard to come by. Cook your own from fresh (try a Southern favorite and make a squash and cheese casserole with a Ritz cracker topping! You'll love it and be so glad you didn't buy this canned yuck.) and save your money for the other Sylvia's items that are delicious. I can highly recommend the Sylvia's Hoppin John.
