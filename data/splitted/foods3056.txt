review/summary: Almost too nourishing ...
review/text: I received the Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty conditioner and have used it several times recently.  I think the conditioner is too much for my hair, which is color treated and very fine.  I think what I need is a shampoo and conditioner to add volume.  This is not the conditioner for me, but I would recommend it for those who have dry hair or thick hair.

review/summary: light scent
review/text: This version of Clear conditioner has a nice, light scent vaguely reminiscent of lavender.  It's not a super-thick conditioner, but it does have a creamy texture.  My hair was soft and easy to comb through after use, but then that's not any different from any other conditioner I've used (some of which are more expensive).  The biggest downside for me was that it opens on the bottom; I prefer bottles that have a pump on top.

review/summary: Not the Best Product for Me
review/text: As I have long, thick somewhat curly hair, I am always looking for a great conditioner that can handle a hard job. This product looked promising according to its claims. I used the conditioner everyday until it ran out (which took close to two weeks for me).<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />I think this has potential for the person with the right hair type. It claims it is for all types of hair, but that is not the case with mine.<br /><br />Though some have complained regarding the bottle design, I rather like it. To get all the conditioner out of a bottle, I usually have to keep it upside down anyway. This bottle is designed to stand "upside down", and consequently, I felt that I was able to use the whole bottle of conditioner.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />I do not see any difference in hair health between using this conditoner and the ones I have used before. My hair does not have a marked change. I will grant that I did not use the companion shampoo, but even so, I expected at least a little improvement in the health of my hair.<br /><br />This conditioner is heavily perfumed. I am not usually sensitive to things like perfumes, but every time I used this product, it made my eyes water and itch slightly.<br /><br />It seemed oily to me (though this may be a plus for some people).I prefer creaminess to oiliness. It has an appearance of being creamy, but feels oily.<br /><br />I won't be using this again, mostly due to the heavy perfume/itchy eye issue. Conditioners certainly are not a  "one size fits all" type thing; this conditioner may very well be great for the right hair type, but it isn't for my hair.

review/text: I've used both the Ultra Shea and the Daily Conditioning Conditioner. Both are creamy, the Ultra Shea is a tad bit thicker in consistency. Both smell fine. The Ultra Shea has a nuttier aroma and the Daily conditioning is a light and fragrant.<br /><br />I use them both as pre-poos. I have 4a/b hair and I used the Ultra Shea as a leave in as well. No miracles here but my hair was left soft and conditioned.

review/text: For the conditioner: This smells really nice and my hair is shiny and soft. As for is it is helping my damaged scalp? I don't think anyone would really be able to tell. I trust the scientific formula the smart guys put in it that it will actually make my scalp healthier. I do really like the scent and how soft and feathery my hair is after using this repeatedly. I also have the shampoo and I used them together for 1 month straight.

review/summary: OK but the shampoo is so good I didn't need this
review/text: I use the CLEAR shampoo and I really like it. I tried the conditioner after using the shampoo and found I didn't need to. The shampoo has plenty of moisturizer for my very fine long hair and using this conditioner made my hair a bit too heavy and half way through the day looked a bit oily. I do like the conditioner but not with the shampoo, I use it after using another brand clarifying shampoo once a week and thats enough for my hair. CLEAR makes a very good product, I recommend the shampoo especially, it's a great moisturizing daily shampoo no conditioner needed.

review/summary: Does a good job of moisturizing dry ends
review/text: I have color treated, below shoulder length hair.  My normal shampoo/conditioner is Paul Mitchell<br />I got both the shampoo and conditioner through the Vine program to try out.  I tossed them into my workout bag and have used them for the past 9 visits to my gym.<br /><br />The shampoo lather is creamy and seems to clean fairly well, it sometimes felt hard to rinse out competely.  It seems quite concentrated and so I started using less and less of it over the trial period, so that might be a good thing.<br />The conditioner feels thick and smooth.  It does a good job of coating my hair all the way down to some of my damages places.  I wouldn't call them repaired, but they were coated enough to smooth them out.  It doesn't seem overly heavy or sticky, rinsed out fairly well and my hair felt silky and slippery (just the way I like it after a shower)<br /><br />I prefer to just let my hair naturally air dry.  I never blow-dry.  These products are excellent in the fact that I didn't have any puffiness or flyaway problems after it dried.  My wavy areas seemed to be smoother and that is ALWAYS a good thing.  My hair turned out to be very soft and smooth looking.  Nice to touch and comb.<br />I did have a bit of a problem with my scalp being itchy and a whole lot flakey after the first few uses, but that has stopped, so there was definitely some changes going on there from this product use.... hopefully for the good.<br />Bottom line is that I like both these products.  They smell really great, and the price is very good for what they do.  I may update this review when I get to the bottom of the bottles.

review/summary: Liked the conditioner, packaging needs work
review/text: First, I really liked the conditioner.  It smells nice, not too strong a scent, it makes my hair feel very soft, it is nice and thick and works into my hair easily.<br /><br />The packaging, however, needs a small adjustment.  It has one of those lids that you push one side in & the conditioner comes out the other side, and the actual lid is nice and large and easy to manipulate, unlike some of the small lids, I really liked that part.  However, with this style of lid you have to squeeze the bottle to get the conditioner out.  Which is fine, except that the plastic is a little bit thick and hard to squeeze, and once the conditioner bottle got to less than half full, it gets harder and harder to squeeze out.  There's a lot of waste.<br /><br />Also, for you guys - my husband puts a little conditioner on his whiskers in the shower to soften up the whiskers before he shaves.  He didn't like this conditioner for that use at all, he said it was too thick and didn't seem to wash out of his beard well and gooped up the razor.<br /><br />In short, fine for hair, needs easier-to-squeeze plastic for the bottle, don't use for a pre-shave treatment :-)

review/text: I previously reviewed the shampoo that is the companion to this conditioner and as with the snampoo, I find this to be a very good product.

review/summary: Excellent moisturizer for dry hair
review/text: This hair conditioner is an excellent product for dry and damaged hair. It provides a very luxurious, thick cream that is absorbed into the hair after shampooing. However, it is not heavy and does not leave any oily residue. My hair was tangle free and free of split ends. It was shiny and easy to manage without getting oily afterwards.<br /><br />The only thing I did not like was the container. In as effort to get all the material out that is in the bottle, the opening is on the bottom. With a touch of your finger you can pop the bottle open and squeeze out what you need, then re-close it. However, I found that it leaks if you are not careful to get it closed tightly. I would rather see the opening on top instead of the bottom.<br /><br />But the product itself was excellent.

Formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera.<br /><br />Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Therapy's range of shampoos and conditioners feed your scalp and give you stronger, more beautiful hair in just 7 days<br /><br />***<br />I have used this product for just 3 days and already my hair and scalp has improved. My hair is now more gray than brown and has a courser feel, but this conditioner added with the shampoo has given it a much softer feel. The scent is very nice and the conditioner has a creamy feel. Very easy to rinse out too.<br /><br />I am probably not the demographic this product was aimed at and am surprised at how well it worked. My only complaint would only affect older individuals or disabled persons like myself. The bottle is very slippery when wet and is not the easiest to squeeze to get the product out. However the unique shape is very beautiful.<br /><br />I will be purchasing more of this product!

review/summary: Clean & light conditioner, but heavily perfumed
review/text: As a summer conditioner, this did a great job. It works in and rinses out easily, and leaves hair soft and clean, but also seems to minimize frizz a bit without feeling heavy.<br /><br />I don't use fancy/expensive shampoo & conditioner, so my bar is fairly low, but this is better than the super cheap stuff (suave, vo5) and works well.<br /><br />However, I found scent too heavy and perfumy to be pleasant while using it. I prefer light citrus, light soap-type, or other natural scents to heavy perfumes. I found the scent cloying & more on par with cheap conditioner. At the store, I open and sniff everything, since the scent is the most challenging aspect of the economy hair products. Based on scent, I wouldn't have bought this in a store. However, it does disappate quickly, so it's only overrpowering while you use it, not after your hair is rinsed and dry.<br /><br />Without the heavy scent, i'd have given it 4 stars for the quality for the price.

review/summary: Rather like it
review/text: This review is going to be the same for the corresponding shampoo, as I received both at the same time to try out. Since I can't (more won't) use each individually to see their own merits because it'll play havoc with my hair, the review is going to be for the both of them.<br /><br />OK. First things first. This produces a lot of lather, which I discovered when I had to clean off the shampoo bottle that had leaked during travel. This is nice since I like lather, but I want to note that hair cleansing products do not need to produce bubbles in order to work. (Very few need to produce bubbles and bubbles/lather is actually from additional bits that have been added to make it look like it's working. Old trivia factoid.) If you're one of the people who dislike having a lot of lather, be prepared for this. (I know that there are people out there like this.)<br /><br />The shampoo and conditioner smell pretty nice, which is a bonus. I've smelled some shampoos that either don't have much of a scent or they're so overwhelming that no amount of other bonuses can make up for the perfume stench. Clear's scent is neither under or overwhelming. You can smell it if you stick your nose into the washed hair or right after you've used it, but it's not going to be smelled across the room.<br /><br />What I really liked was that this didn't weight my hair down overly much. My hair feels nice and soft, without feeling heavy or greasy. I'm pretty finicky about shampoo/conditioner products since many will either undercondition (making me look like a brown haired Little Orphan Annie) or they'll undercondition and I'll end up with hair that looks lank and greasy. (I've been pretty happy with my Garnier Nutrisse products for the most part, although lately it feels like they've changed the formula slightly.) What I also liked is that after using the combo a few times, I don't get a weird buildup feeling to my hair.<br /><br />I rather like this overall. I'm still not sure if I'd overall replace my normal shampoo and conditioner, but I'm willing to give this a longer trial period. I've already purchased more of this product with my own money, so I suppose that this is as good of a recommendation as any.

review/summary: The Foundation for a Nourished Scalp
review/text: This new product attacks dry, damaged hair by treating your "hair-soil"; your scalp. It seems to be working. "Clear Scalp and Hair Therapy Conditioner" is a vitamin/nutrient compound bursting with healthy additives. As with all hair conditioners, be careful not to over-use the product, as oily conditioners can swamp and strangle hair follicles, creating hair distress. This conditioner has ten vitamins and nutrients, including Vitamin C, Vitamin E, sunflower, soybean, and coconut oils. An internet search reveals that healthy, fast-growing hair can be stimulated by Vitamin B6 and b12. "Clear Scalp Therapy" contains Vitamin B5.

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: I'm reviewing the shampoo and conditioner together here because it is likely that many people will be interested in buying both products  simultaneously.<br /><br />In regard to shipping, my experience was similar to what other Vine reviewers have said. I ordered both the shampoo and the conditioner and both leaked in the air bubble packaging they were shipped in. The conditioner bottle was actually broken and now can't be closed properly. The shampoo has a toggle cover that even a small child can open, and my guess is that it was inadvertently opened when packed for mailing. Along with others, I suggest that the company devise something more sturdy to prevent this type of leakage.<br /><br />I have normal hair and scalp and a typical short haircut. I prefer to use natural organic soaps and shampoos and only decided to order these products because this appeared in the Vine product description:<br />`Formulated with Nutrium 10, an advanced moisture complex of vitamins and nutrients including vitamins B5, C & E, sunflower, almond, soybean & coconut oils & aloe vera.'<br /><br />The shampoo made my hair look dry and a little frizzy and also less lustrous. To me, the most noticeable thing about the conditioner is that it has a very powerful scent that lingers for a long time. I'm used to the natural scents of organic products and don't like chemical scents at all.<br /><br />The old saying 'You get what you pay for' is true here. These products can become popular because they are relatively low priced and work similar to comparable items.

review/summary: A pretty good, inexpensive conditioner
review/text: This conditioner is thick, rich, and quite heavily scented.  You don't need to apply much. I doubt that the vitamins in it actually nourish the scalp--I believe you need to eat vitamins for them to have any effect on your body. I have medium-length, fine hair, and this conditioner worked as well as any I have ever used. However, I'm not very picky about conditioners. I expect that the way the bottle opens at the bottom will become convenient as time goes on. The bottle will always be turned upside down, so I won't have to do that specifically to get out the conditioner when there isn't much left.

review/summary: Solid Product, Expensive for the Category
review/text: Clear Scalp and Hair Beauty Total Care Nourishing Conditioner is a new line of hair care products with the parent company Unliver the same as Dove products.  Overall, the product does seem very similar to Dove products.<br /><br />The product aims to be for all hair types and comes in a slick, curved bottle.  The stated marketing philosophy behind clear is that your hair's condition truly comes down to your scalp's condition.  Therefore, the product in theory aims to make your scalp healthier, which will produce stronger, nicer hair.<br /><br />In summary, the product is a solid drugstore/supermarket conditioner.  The scent is somewhat strong, but most will find it acceptable.  There is not a lot to dislike about this product compared to its drugstore/supermarket competitors.  However, you cannot say it is leap and bounds above its competitors either.  It's simply a solid product and perhaps just slightly overpriced at some retailers for the category it competes against.  It is not a salon, professional quality product.  For men who might find the fragrance off putting, there is a men's line available too which I find to be a more pleasing, masculine scent.<br /><br />The best, affordable while delivering exceptional results Shampoo/Conditioner I had found continues to be Kirkland's Shampoo & Conditioner from Costco.  Per ounce, it costs less than your drugstore shampoo/conditioner, but offers a professional quality product.

review/summary: Modest improvement
review/text: This "Total Care Nourishing Conditioner" provided a modest improvement over the conditioner my wife and I normally use (one of the more budget-conscious brands).  I'm in a frequent battle with the "frizzies" and I did notice when using this conditioner that there were fewer frizzies to battle. Add to that a mild bump in our hair's smoothness/silkiness and I can give this conditioner a mild thumbs-up.  Note that you're instructed to massage the conditioner into your scalp in addition to running it through your hair.<br /><br />The way the bottle itself is designed reduces the amount of product that gets gunked up around the top, which is a nice improvement over our other conditioner. You do, however, have to put some muscle into squeezing the thing, especially as you get near the bottom of the bottle.

review/text: I liked the shampoo and I really liked this conditioner, as well. It did a great job moisturizing hair and scalp without being too heavy. The second time I used it I tried an experiment. My daughter had been talking about using salt water as a product to get that tousled beach wave look to your hair, but that she added conditioner to her salt water spray so it wouldn't dry her hair out. I made a large bucket of salt water and Clear Nourishing conditioner and dunked my head in it, figured the salt water would be good for my scalp. Then I just let my hair dry. I have dry naturally curly hair and the result was fantastic! I like this conditioner very much, with or without the salt water. I recommend it!

review/summary: Better than most, but depends on the length of your hair
review/text: I'll be the first to admit I'm not picky about my hair-care products. That being said, I used this conditioner before I cut my hair and my hair was noticeably softer and less inclined to get wild afterward when compared to many other low-end conditioners. When I cut my hair from about 3 inches to 3/4 of an inch, however, I noticed no difference between this and a same-bottle shampoo/conditioner. So, if you have short hair, this won't make much difference. I also have fairly average hair density, so I can't speak for those with really thin or thick hair.<br /><br />While this product is not geared toward a specific gender, I was a little dismayed to find out that they conditioner is scented (there's no such indication on the bottle). The scent is very noticeable and will last most of the day, and in both my and my girlfriend's opinion is not very suitable for most men; she described the scent as "perfume-y." This scent was enough to make me not use the conditioner on days I left the house.

review/summary: Really good conditioner for me
review/text: UPDATE: The longer I use this conditioner, the healthier my hair has become. If you're looking for shiny, healthy hair, this conditioner and the same line's Strong Lengths and Root Boost formulas (which appear to be identical) are great.  I am not wild about the fragrance and I wish I could get more of a body boost, but with these minor caveats I highly recommend this conditioner.  Plenty of people even like the fragrance.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW: So far, I really like this conditioner. My hair is generally fine and limp; shoulder length; straight-ish; dark blonde with gray.  After using this conditioner, my gray seemed more silver and my hair had more shine over-all. I don't see anything in the ingredients that should affect the color, but the color definitely seemed different and so much better.  I think the change occurred due to the increased shine that caused my hair to reflect so much more light.<br /><br />I usually blow dry and find my hair a bit difficult to style.  After this conditioner, styling was easy.  My hair held the straight-with-slight-curve-at-the-ends style that I prefer -- ALL DAY without hairspray.<br /><br />This conditioner seemed to give my hair a touch more body. Since my hair has so little natural body, any change for the better is noticeable.<br /><br />It didn't leave static or a fly-away feeling.  There was no sense of added weight or other residue.<br /><br />The scent is not my favorite, not bad, but not something I'd choose. Some other reviewers found the scent to be overwhelming, but I did not, even though I have a very strong sense of smell.

review/text: This product works great on super-long, super-thick hair, so it should be good for anybody. Whereas Matrix shampoo requires an anti friz cream for this hair type, and Pantene leaves it greasy, this product leaves hair with a healthy look and feel. And unlike other competitors the feeling lasts for much longer than 2 days. This product makes straightening easier, and it smells good too. It exceeds all expectations. I wouldn't be surprised to see many, many others switch from their current conditioner to this one.  Same with the shampoo.

review/text: I really liked this conditioner. It left my hair feeling very soft and the slip was great! I thought it was a little too perfumey straight out of the bottle, but it really made my hair smell great! As for the scalp nourishing benefits, it's still a little too early to tell, but I'll definitely continue using this product.

review/summary: Clean, soft hair, but too fragrant for me
review/text: I've been using this conditioner for a week now. Combined with the shampoo, you are left with very silky smooth hair. The conditioner washes out cleanly and the scent is nice. However, I'm sensitive to scents and though this one doesn't give me a headache (some do), you can smell it ALL DAY. It *is* a nice clean smell, but I was surprised that the scent stayed with me all day. And all night. All the way until the next morning.<br /><br />The conditioner rinses clean. It's a nice compliment to the shampoo. Very creamy.<br /><br />I was surprised that this item came in a a bubble mailer. It was crushed a little and some of the product had leaked out. Hopefully this won't be the case for future shipments of this item. I also kinda wish they both opened at the same end; the shampoo opens on the top, the conditioner on the bottom.

review/summary: My hair never felt so soft.......
review/text: I absolutely love this shampoo & conditioner.....I have long, thick wavy hair & am always trying different products to keep it soft & smooth. This stuff is great....I can't attest to the 'nourish your scalp' claim, but I do know how it makes my hair feel & smell-wonderful! I usually leave my waves to dry naturally, using a leave-in conditioner, but with this-I don't need it. I think I've tried just about everything on the market-from the cheap to the Salon, high-priced & I am very impressed with Clear Scalp. I will definitely be looking for it when it hits the stores.

review/summary: Clear conditioner
review/text: When a product is named "Clear" one would think it's actually clear and perhaps natural. This is neither. This conditioner pours from the bottom of the bottle (whoever came up with that idea was genius!) and actually ribbons out. I only used a little because I could feel that my hair was already soft from the Clear shampoo I'd just used. The conditioner, while having a pleasing fragrance, added to whatever the shampoo dumped onto my hair and aided in further weighing it down. I'd recommend this for someone with thicker hair, mine is thin and I really didn't enjoy the fly-aways that it gave me all day.

review/summary: Love this Conditioner
review/text: I loved this conditioner, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner, Despite its arrival leaking in its container, which I have mentioned before, I would definitely use this conditioner again. My dry, damaged hair, at my age of 60 years old, is long and wavy. I like to wear it down. It is still one of my best assests -- I was a strawberry blonde growing up, and the color was commented on regularly. Of course it is FAKE now--I dye it, but it is still pretty when I have it well conditioned .<br />Yes, I like to throw my hair back and shake it around like a supermodel does, and pretend I am in my twenties. I look like an idiot with short hair. Sorry if it is inappropriate in your opinion, to have long hair at my age. ;)<br />As my husband says re my supermodel fantasy, "Sure, that and a time machine set back 40 years or so, and you will be all set!"<br /><br />Oh! He's a funny, funny guy.<br /><br />So, at any rate, no matter if you have weather-beaten, dried out hair, over-dyed and long, which is also old and brittle, this product, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Total Care Nourishing Conditioner,  WILL work for you, and quite possibly the 20 year old supermodels in your family as well!<br />thanks, jean

review/summary: It's OK
review/text: I will review this conditioner along with its shampoo, CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY Moisturizing Dry Scalp Nourishing Shampoo, 12.9 Fluid Ounce (https://www.amazon.com/gp/vine/product?ie=UTF8&asin=B007RTR8A2).  Just to let you know, I copied and pasted the review from the shampoo (which I reviewed first) and adjusted some words and the link to the shampoo.<br /><br />I received the shampoo, then the following week ordered the conditioner. I put up my other hair products, so as to allow these products a chance to prove themselves to me. I began using them both on Sunday; today is Wednesday. My hair has been very soft and manageable; it's naturally curly and has been very easy to comb through after my shower. So, I would say that I was pretty happy with the results.<br /><br />Until this morning. Something really curious happened. When I opened the shampoo bottle and turned it upside down to pour into my hand, a liquid came out that wasn't the shampoo. It was very watery. Yes, I'm positive that the bottle was closed yesterday and that nobody opened it. There was perhaps three tablespoons of this watery stuff before the shampoo came out.<br /><br />I washed my hair and reached for the conditioner - which, by the way, has its opening on the bottom of the bottle. The same thing happened! First, some type of liquid came out, then the conditioner.<br /><br />I've never had to shake a shampoo or conditioner before, so I'm not sure what happened. Either way, I won't be using it anymore.<br /><br />It did a nice job, though, except for the liquid issue.

review/summary: Not for fine hair
review/text: I found this product worked as advertised. It had a mild and unoffensive scent. A very small amount of the product goes a long way. While I noticed a reduction in breakage, I wouldn't use this product again. After a week of use my hair never quite felt clean. It was heavier (but not greasy) and a little dull. I felt like I had product in my hair even though I no longer use any type of mousse or pomade. For my very fine hair the product was successful but not pleasing.

review/summary: Melt-In-Your-Mouth Peppermint Sticks
review/text: I love these AMAZING King Leo Brand Peppermint Sticks sold by Candy Crate. They melt away in your mouth, from the first stick to the last. I've been ordering these from Candy Crate for years - first on their web site and now from Amazon. If you like peppermint, you should try these King Leo Brand Peppermint Sticks. I don't know how they make these peppermint sticks so soft, but make them they do - and they are mouth-watering. When I first ordered these peppermint stick, I thought they would be hard like all the rest.  Boy was I surprised.  I put that first stick in my mouth and in just a few minutes, it was gone.  Of course I generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth.  That way I can savor them longer.  The last order I placed in June 2012 was for 5 boxes because I had run out of boxes, and I hate to do that - leaving me without my favorite candy.  And to top it off, these peppermint sticks are low in fat.  What a bonus.  Do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more boxes you order as these boxes are heavy.  I hope you enjoy these peppermint sticks as much as I do - I am constantly eating them throughout the day.  I guess that is why I go through my boxes so quickly, and they may be high in sugar content, but I haven't gained a single pound from eating these sticks!

"Ingredients: Red ripe Jalapeno peppers, distilled vinegar, salt, spices and Jack Daniel's Black Label Whiskey."<br /><br />Really?  REALLY?  Change your label to "Historic Lynchburg Tennessee Whiskey Jalapeno Hot Sauce."<br /><br />Some people are looking for more heat.  No reason to lie to people, Lynchburg Merchandise Company.

review/text: This sauce is indeed fairly hot, but it's more about the flavor with this one.  I went to sample some with crackers and just kept adding more and more with each cracker.  Before I knew it I was 1/4 of the way through the bottle just trying to sample it for flavor.  The primary flavor is the habaneros with just enough seasonings to make it interesting.<br /><br />The bottle says it is also 151 proof, and Jack Daniels black Label Whiskey is listed on the ingredients list.  The endorphine rush from the heat plus the kick from a shot of whiskey is rather nice in my opinion.<br /><br />I would definitely buy this sauce again.

review/summary: One of my all time favorite gummis!
review/text: I've loved the Haribo gummi series almost in it's entirety.  I have a more complete review on the Haribo 5 pound bag.  This review is simply for the fact that they come in 12 5 ounce bags.  Great for trips, traveling, gifts and "metering your intake"of gummi frogs.<br /><br />These make a great snack to be left in the glove compartment of my vehicle. Available when I need them. They don't seem to melt together when they get warm. The white belly texture is almost like a toughened up version of marshmallowish texture. Interesting on the tongue. The flavour of the frog is interesting as well. Some say a pineapplish sort of green tea pear flavor. Same flavor as green frogs I've found in department store/food places, so I'm guessing its the universal frog flavor or the same brand more likely. Later I found out that the green part is flavored apple and the white side is passion fruit. Definitely an interesting gummi!

review/text: About $2.50 per pack, which is a sale price at the grocery stores in our area, so a good deal here. The cookies arrived today and my husband and kids ripped a pack open and acted like starving wolves...lol...I tried one and wow, they are so fresh and crispy and delish!!  I actually got two cookies out of that bag. I am thinking of hiding a bag for MAMA TIME, whatever that is!!  We all have our dreams. SIGH.

review/summary: Pleasantly spicy!
review/text: I had earlier enjoyed Harissa Olive flavored oil. It added a nice, albeit rather gentle, heat when I used it with cheese for a delightful little snack. Heartened by that experiwence, when I saw this tube of Harissa hot sauce in a tube, I ordered the product.<br /><br />It adds a nice edge to food onto which I squeeze some of the sauce. I normally prefer more heat than this, but the end result is pleasant enough.<br /><br />So, I report that my investment in this product has paid off. A little milder heat than I prefer, but still a tasty add on.

review/summary: Never again
review/text: I've been into harissa for the last 2 years after reading about it in a recipe and been hooked since. Recently purchased this one because of the great price but that should've told me something. After receiving it I used in on a rice dish and I was disappointed in the flavor, oiliness and paste like constancy. I looked at the ingredients and the first thing listed was VEGETABLES???? I've learned that the main ingredient in harissa should be 'red chili peppers' not vegetables! I learned vegetables are used as a filler to make more product. Not buying this product ever again.

review/text: This dish is classic southern Mediterranean food. It has stood the test of time since ancient Egypt. When you violate time-honored tradition and try to improvise, more often than not you'll end up going astray. This is what happened in this case; they went astray. The resulting taste of violating traditional ingredients can never be accepted by the true aficionados of pure traditional stuffed grape leaves. It tastes yucky; I ended up giving it to my dog. He ate it, but then gave me that look, you know what I am talking about; "Why me? What did I ever do to you?)..... Stay away; it is definitely not worth half what it sells for.

They stay crisp, have a good mouth feel, and are very satisfying.<br /><br />If you can find them at your grocer's, get them there.<br /><br />I bought the 7-pack option, and they arrived with two or three cookies on one or both ends of the packages crushed to dust.<br /><br />I'm not asking Amazon to replace them because I'm going to put the crushed biscuits in breakfast cereal, and we're going to eat them. They're quite good that way too. But I will suggest that Amazon take the fragility of these biscuits into account when shipping them in the future.

If you are a tea drinker these biscuits are perfect. If you need something a little sweeter with your tea or just a glass of milk, they also come with milk or dark chocolate coating on top.<br />The only problem, if you call it a problem, they are as addictive as popcorn. I've opened a packet of McVitie's biscuits to get out a couple and end up eating half the pack.<br />You will not find anything made in the USA that tastes like these cookies. The closest you can get would be Graham Crackers, but it would only be close.

review/text: These biscuits are almost like a cookie, but a little more like a cracker.  The texture and flavor go together wonderfully.  If you read the history behind these biscuits, you'll find that they've been very popular amongst the Brits for a very long time.  I'm surprised they haven't hit the grocery store shelves over here in the states.  They are compared to the graham cracker, but still aren't the same.  To me they are more like the graham cracker crust for pies.<br />I love, love, love these biscuits with cheese, by themselves, dipped in chocolate and I'm sure some other ways that I haven't tried yet.  I bet they'd make a wonderful crust and are used as such for some British desserts.

review/text: These traditional english buiscuits can be hard to find in regular grocery stores. It was a surprise to find them on Amazon. They arrived quickly and amazingly fresh and uncrumbled. This is a feat because their texture is very crisp and crumbly. They are somewhere between a not very sweet cookie and a salty cracker, thicker than a regular cracker with an almost shortbread quality. They have a deliciously satisfying nutty whole meal flavor. I have one for breakfast every day with a thin slice of low fat cheddar on top. My husband has one or two as an after dinner treat.

review/text: This is a crunchy, barely-sweet, perfect accompaniment to practically any not too sweet drink -- tea, of course, including iced tea; milk or Ovaltine, dry white or red wine [include some cheese]; coffee; whiskey; brandy.  Include some in a packet of home-packed snacks that you carry on a car or plane trip.  It's true that they arrive a bit smashed: phooey!  Well, pick out the chunks and enjoy!  I have some round tins that I got from American Science and Surplus; these tins are exactly the right size to hold about ten biscuits, and keep them on your desk, by your bed, or in the snack pack. The lid is sort of loose. There are some other round tins that chocolate sections from Trader Joe came in; these have tight lids and hold about four biscuits, so are a good choice for purse or backpack.

review/summary: decent, but not as dental as I expected
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would help keep my cats teeth clean and their breath fresh. I wish I had read the ingredients before I purchased it because it doesn't seem to have any enzymatic ingredients found in true, working dental treats. Also the only breath freshening ingredients- rosemary and chlorophyll, are at the very tail end of the ingredient list as dead last and third to last. I am glad that these ingredients are present, but they are in such small quantities, that they can't be helping much. From personal experience, I have not noticed and breath freshening results. I think the only reason why they are "dental" treats is because of the small amount of rosemary and chlorophyll as well as the fact that they are crunchy and not moist treats, which is very good. Another issue I have with these treats is that my cats only like this product while its very fresh. They seem to go stale really easily, like within a week, and then after that my cats don't care for it. I always close them tightly and I've even tried putting them in a separate bag- in container, but still no luck. If your looking for a real dental treat I would recommend Crunch n' Clean with DentaShield. However, this is still a MUCH better treat than Pounce brand or Meow Mix or any soft treat that can have soft sticky particles that will stay stuck to your cats teeth and smell bad and cause dental problems. This treat may not help teeth significantly, but they definitely won't hurt them and probably do some good; just not as much as I expected for the price. Also there are tuns of vitamin in these, which is pretty cool. They really are pretty decent treats, and I would probably give them 4 stars if they were just treats. However, to be marketing them as "dental," they really should have enzymes or more prevalent dental ingredient.

I give them several treats in the morning and again in the evening.  They keep count, and if they are shorted one or two, they follow me around the house until the issue is resolved.  It is nice that they are good dental treats as well (good checkups at the vet--maybe these are the reason).  I switch up the flavors from time to time, all of which they love.  I highly recommend them to anyone wanting to treat their pet to a little something.

review/text: My daughter moved in with her cat. Some how, we now have 3 cats, that is, she now has 3 cats. The Vet gave us some greenies when we took them in for checkups. I wasn't sure what they were and the cats didn't seem to like them at first. That is, until they actually tasted them. That changed things. So far, I have tried the Oven Roasted Chicken, Ocean Fish, Tempting Tuna and Succulent Beef on them. The cats love them and my daughter is angry with me for spoiling the cats.

review/summary: Absolutely Flawlessly Delicious!  I would pay twice as much!
review/text: These candies are flat out delicious! I've read all the reviews here and can't understand how there could be a 1 star review of this product!! Just because you personally don't care for how a product tastes does not lend to a bad review.  The fault is your own for purchasing a product don't even like!<br /><br />As for my review, these candies are awesome!  I personally don't care for the black raspberry, but I can just give those to my wife!  I'm really surprised these aren't more expensive as I feel they should be more of a gourmet type candy!  At such a great price for 12 packs, I'm in candy heaven!!<br /><br />In fact, I buy 24 at a time to save on shipping to make it even cheaper!<br /><br />If you like raspberry you will love this product.  Plane and simple.

review/summary: Yummy Berries!
review/text: Haribo berries - raspberries and blackberries - are gummy candies with tiny pearl-like candy coverings. They are one of our family's favorite candies, and Amazon is the best (cheapest) place to buy them!

review/summary: Flavorful & Sweet
review/text: These are really cute candies.  Each drop is wrapped into hundred of crunchy round bits, just like a real berry.  Oozing with flavor and enticing aroma.  The gummi part is found inside.  Although the Haribo bears are my ultimate favorite, I find this one a bit too sweet for the taste.

review/summary: Sorta Stale
review/text: I really love the gummi raspberry candies. These aren't particularly soft or fresh-tasting, and the candy non-pareils [the little beady candies] are a bit too large.  Perhaps other Haribo candies are better, but I can't enthusiastically recommend these.

review/summary: Haribo Raspberries
review/text: What can I say... These are the true Raspberry candies I remember eating while growing up in Germany, all others are just knock-off, imitations!  Nothing beats the Haribo brands!

review/summary: Wonderful treats!
review/text: These are not like other Haribo gummis.  They really try to imitate real raspberries.  The outside is somewhat crunchy which means when you chew it, it gives a mouth feel somewhat like real raspberries, seeds and all.<br /><br />The flavor is right on, fantastic real raspberry taste!  Yum!

review/summary: Not like other Haribo gummis
review/text: Don't order a case of these if you've never had them.  I love all the other Haribo gummies I've had (bears, cokes, burgers, etc), but found these weird and didn't enjoy them.  I'm probably just not used to crunchy things on my gummies, but I gave the rest of the case away.
