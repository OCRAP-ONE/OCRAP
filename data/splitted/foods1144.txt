review/summary: not too sweet, not too strong, just right
review/text: As a long time tea drinker, was happy to come across this iced tea mix.  It serves as my sports drink while exercising or golfing.  I find this iced tea very refreshing.  I really like the flavor and especially the low sugar content.  The plain green is my favorite followed by the raspberry.  The blueberry is good too; it's unsweetened, so I add half a packet of Truvia.

review/text: I really enjoy this tea because it's not to sweet and it's easy to use.  I carry it and my mug with me and just add hot or cold water, depending upon my mood.  I find that it gives me just the right kind of energy and it can even hold my hunger between meals. A real great thing because I watch my calories.  And of course, green tea is full of antioxidants.

review/summary: Great product - at last!
review/text: LOVE this!  I dislike drinking plain water and have been looking for something easy that I could add to my s/s water bottle (gotta be good to the environment, right?)  The flavor is great, ease of convenience is wonderful and the hint of sweet is not overpowering at all.  I can drink my green tea with or without sweetener.  The only thing is if you want to drink green tea all day long, the calories WILL add up - I think each packet is 60 calories.  I drink 2 (32 oz) bottles of water a day so that would be 120 calories of sweetened drink a day.  But I will still give the product 5 stars because the product is fab.  I'd just pick something else if I'm going to pound water all day long (perhaps the blueberry green tea one which is NOT sweetened - it's excellent as well)  I'll use this for one bottle and a non-sweetened one for the other.  Best of both worlds.  Enjoy!

review/text: I used to always go to Jamba Juice for the Match green tea shots...after trying this iced green tea powder I was hooked.  This flavor is lightly sweetend and the raspberry and pomegranate flavors are just subtle enough to not mask the true flavor of the green tea.  I don't mind the funny green color...after all it's green tea.

review/summary: Beware, if you have a corn allergy!!
review/text: The first ingredient in this mix, before the tea is even listed is maltodextrin.  If you suffer from a corn allergy, please do not forget to read the label & unwittingly drink this.  I have no idea why there is more maltodextrin in this product than the main product, the tea itself.  I realize this is not a review, let alone a "helpful review", as I did not describe the taste of the product or even review the product. I couldn't review this product, if I wanted too.  I want people with a corn allergy to be advised of the ingredients in the tea.  I didn't know how else to inform folks about the ingredients except for on the page with reviews.  I could not give the product more stars, as it contains more maltodextrin, than tea itself.

review/summary: lightly sweetened green iced tea powder
review/text: i have never liked green tea but i knew it was good for me so i have been drinking it for a lot of yrs. i grew up living in the western usa and our neighbors were japanese. they were sweet and gave us tea from japan. my father enjoyed it every morning and added a tablespoon of honey and a little cream to it. he smoked all his life and died at 92. anyway, i found when at times i would quit drinking it i wouldn't feel as good as i did when drinking it. i got tired of boiling the water with the teabags and then getting everything in a container to put into the frig. i really drank a lot of it.  well, i stumbled onto a warehouse to pick up some things i had ordered and noticed this tea. i was immediately interested as you get to drink the whole tea leaf which gives you 10 times more antioxidants. wow, that was good for me so i got a couple cases and when i ran out searched the internet for stash brand. i really love it. i love that it is LIGHTLY SWEETENED, i love that i can just open a packet and throw it into my tumbler, add ice and water and be on my way. it's just right. but more then anything else i love the way it makes me feel. so much more energy and i truly believe it is helping my well being. no getting around about it i don't get sick often for sure. now i haven't tried the other brands and i feel i don't have to because i am so satisfied with this one. the price is also cheaper. i don't think you can go wrong with this choice.  perky

review/text: I bought this tea as I like blueberries, and Stash is known as making good teas.  However, when I first emptied the drink mix in the water the color was an odd green (not very appetizing).  Once I mixed the powder with water, the resulting tea had no real flavor.  I feel like I wasted my money and can't get a refund.

review/summary: Pretty good stuff, with the right sweetener
review/text: This is one of my favorite water add-ins. I think it has a really crisp, clean taste...with a hint of grassy-ness. The tea particles tend to settle at the bottom of the bottle, if left standing for more than a few minutes, so I have to shake it up periodically. There are times when I feel like I'm drinking something that was squeezed off the blades of a lawnmower, but this seems to be based on my choice of sweetener. It tastes great when I use stevia, but when I use Sweet & Low...I get a bitter-ish grassy taste.

review/summary: Don't bother
review/text: I bought this "flavor" and the raspberry pom and while they are consistent, it's useless.<br /><br />If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak in flavor, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However, if you're idea is to "stash" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men, which would be weird) it's still misses the mark. One packet does very little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHO drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature? Also, with only 8 to 12 packets in a box (depends on flavor, who knows why?), that gives you 4 to 6, 16 oz drinks for $3. Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this.

review/summary: Packaging leaves much to be desired.
review/text: This order reached me quickly.<br /><br />I opened up the box to see two packages of the box in the same package. In hindsight, knowing that the seller had the same facility in my state, I shouldn't have bothered to get it delivered overnight.<br /><br />Onto the tea... they were simply thrown into the box as mentioned by someone else. I should've taken this as a warning not to purchase it, as it was not well packaged much like other teabags delivered to me. After I tried the tea, I found the taste to be weak, and the contents of the teabag often coming out of the teabags themselves even though they were not torn either way.<br /><br />Leads me to think that the QA on this isn't very good. Again, in hindsight, I shouldn't have gotten a 100-count box. Ah well. I don't think I'll purchase this particular product again, and I'll more than likely give the second tea box away to someone else.

review/summary: Disappointed with STASH PREMIUM TEA
review/text: STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used. The Lemon Ginger has the most flavor of all the flavors I've tried. If you don't mind a Lemon Ginger tea with a flowery taste you might want to try it.  I purchased a 100 - count box. I will never buy it again.

review/summary: I anxiously awaited it..and then it was just not quite 'it'..
review/text: I had this tea in my cart for awhile and then it became unavailable, so I waited for it to come back in stock as this sounded like a nice tea.<br /><br />I have been enjoyed the Celestial Seasonings White Tea with Pear that I got on Amazon and so I anxioulsy anticipated this new tea.<br /><br />However, in drinking it, I'm not all that crazy about it. To me, it tastes like a black tea; I hardly taste the ginger at all, and it's not as pepperminty as I thought it would be.<br /><br />I realize tastes are just so personal, but that's how I view it anyway.<br /><br />Oh, you should know that it comes in a regular box (as pictured) and not in a tea box at all. So, you will want a cannister, tea tin, or something to put it in.<br /><br />In the meantime, I do like the White Tea with Pear..

review/summary: Best tasting peppermint tea!
review/text: First introduced to this delicious tea when served @ a gourmet breakfast place in Blowing Rock, NC.<br /><br />Took a bag home w/ me so I could look for it online.  Pleased to find it on Amazon for a steal & w/ free shipping!<br /><br />I've been drinking Peppermint tea for years & this one has the very best flavor I've experienced.  I usually enjoy my tea sweetened w/ a little honey but took some to my skinny sis who lives without honey & was suprised @ how delicious this was even without any sweetener:)<br /><br />The first time I ordered this I ordered it packaged in (6), 20 count boxes which was great b/c when running out to someone's house for dinner or a visit I could grab a box to give as a modest hostess gift.<br /><br />This time ordered the box of 100 b/c of the significant value!<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this as much as I do.

review/text: I haven't purchased this item from Amazon, but I came here to find it since I haven't been able to get it locally recently. I started drinking tea because of the health benefits, but I didn't really care for it. Then I found Stash's Green Chai, which I started to really enjoy. Then I found the White Chai, which is even better, and apparently has even more antioxidants and health benefits than the green. A cup every morning starts my workday off right. I am excited to find this good deal on the large package.

review/summary: Best tea, great way to reduce packaging waste!
review/text: My husband loves green tea and will only drink Stash. I got really annoyed by all the packaging, so I was extremely happy when I saw this 100-count box.<br /><br />That's ALL you get: one small box filled with 100 individually wrapped tea bags. The box doesn't come in a box, how awesome is that?! Also, no more fighting with the plastic wrap and filling your recycling bin with hundreds of flimsy little Stash boxes.<br /><br />The tea itself is delicious. Very earthy, clean and slightly grassy. It reminds me of the green tea you get in real Japanese restaurants, but a bit less grassy (which I like).<br /><br />Decaf is perfect if you want hot tea during the evening.

review/text: I am absolutely thrilled with this tea.  I love Autumn and the scent and flavor of this tea reminds me so much of everything I love about Autumn.  The spices are perfect to give an excellent aroma and flavor...In my opinion, this is the perfect beverage to have as you curl up with a good book on a cool afternoon, or to enjoy as a delicious dinnertime tea.  I like to drink it with raw, unprocesed cane sugar.  I feel the cane sugar gives this tea even more the taste of a special chilly-weather treat.  I plan to drink this tea as my after dinner drink each evening, and will definitely be purchasing it again and again.  Kudos to you, Stash...and kudos to Amazon for having such a great price.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This tea is one of my favorites.  It has a clean, subtle, delicious flavor very similar to the Stash White Decaf Lemon, but unlike the lemon it's lemongrass free, which can be important for people with grass allergies.<br /><br />Three warnings for this tea:<br /><br />1.  If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.  I think this is comparable to flavored water in the intensity of the flavor, though it would be unfair to compare this to the fake chemical flavor of a propel water bottle!<br /><br />2.  It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.  It tastes like it would be lovely, but the flavor oil leaves a film on the top that I find unappetizing.<br /><br />Enjoy your tea!

review/summary: Great tea, just a touch too light
review/text: I purchased this because I wanted a decaf white tea that had some flavor to it.  I normally don't enjoy fruit flavored teas.  This one is a great flavor, but I have noticed it needs to steep longer to get enough flavor out of it.  The raspberry is a little too subtle.<br /><br />The outer package is the pictured cardboard box, but the tea bags are individually wrapped in air tight packets (the small white packet shown with the box) which are pretty enough for display or gift baskets. If you aren't sure about buying 100 at a time, look for a sample package on Amazon or elsewhere (though the Amazon prices are impressive compared to other ones I've seen).<br /><br />If you are interested in a full-flavor tea, I highly recommend Stash's White Christmas Tea.

review/text: I tell everyone I know to buy this tea.  It's the ONLY chocolate tea I've found that actually tastes like chocolate!  It's not overwhelming and although I'm not normally a fan of hazelnut, it really only serves to act as a flavor enhancer to the chocolate.  It's just awesome, hands down, not weak either, although it is decaf.  The price here is a bit high - you can get this in the store that begins and ends with a t here in the States for about two dollars and a quarter for the 18 bag size.  Great, incredible stuff, I'm almost out again!  Highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Not as Peachy as the Black Tea
review/text: If you like peach teas, this is not the one for you.  The peach flavor is lost and it tastes more like an Oolong tea.  I would recommend the Peach Black Tea by Stash instead.

review/text: Stash chai tea is tasty and the large box was perfect for ordering tea for my wedding favors.  It doesn't hurt that the dark red bags go well with my colors either :)  I ordered this along with a box of 100 Bigelow English Breakfast tea bags with the free super saver shipping and they arrived together within a week, so I'm pretty satisfied.

review/text: I am a bit of a Tea Crazy (I counted last week and found I have over 40 boxes at home, because I drink a TON of green and chamomile tea and have some others, too. I started drinking Oolong tea about two years ago and really enjoyed it - this one is no exception. You could add honey to it but it tastes very flavourful and sweet without. There's no bitterness to it like there is with some herbal teas without honey. It's a really nice lunchtime/afternoon relaxing tea to have!

review/summary: Wonderul tea!
review/text: I originally bought a small box of this at the grocery store to see if it could replace my nightly cup (sometimes 3) of hot chocolate during our cold Maine falls and winters! I LOVED it! I guess if you like your tea with a splash of milk or cream it'll taste even more like mint hot chocolate but I only drink tea plain but that's what friends of mine have done when they come over.  This box is also an AMAZING price considering the local stores (that IF they carry this flavor, which 99% don't,) sell it for at least $3.50 a box. Great deal for a great tea! On ward to health and warmth! ;)

review/text: I've been looking for a really good peachy flavored black tea. This is probably the best I've found, though still tastes more fruity than peachy, if that makes any sense. It came in a box with all the tea loose inside, so you'll need something to keep it in, or leave it in the cardboard box. I'm using a lock and lock container.

review/summary: Delicious! *****
review/text: This blend of Earl Grey from Stash Tea is delicious. It is the most fragrant Earl Grey we have ever enjoyed. The blend has a floral quality to it; not overpoweringly sweet but quite distinctive. Not herbal.<br /><br />The taste is similarly floral with no harsh black tea flavor. It must be low in caffeine as I experience no "spikes", either.<br /><br />A very distinctive blend for which Stash should be pleased.
