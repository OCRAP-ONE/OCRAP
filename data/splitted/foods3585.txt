review/summary: Crisp and refreshing
review/text: This water tastes clean, crisp, and refreshing. It's filtered, so it doesn't leave an aftertaste and doesn't really taste like anything-in my book, that's good water! It's also supposedly infused with electrolytes, but I don't know how you'd notice that since it just looks/tastes like normal filtered water.

review/summary: Silky smooth water with electrolytes
review/text: I highly recommend this water to those that enjoy Smartwater.  It is very similar but Essentia does something different and delivers it at 9.5 ph.  Does it make it taste different? Not really but they say it is better for you than drinking the ionized water at a higher ph.  Bottom line it tastes great, easy to drink and has electrolytes so it is a winner in my book.

review/summary: Smooth
review/text: I have to say, I don't think I've ever had a bottled water that tastes as light as this water from Essentia does. Right from the outset, you'll notice it and I don't think it has anything to do with any sort of chemical process to get it that way but I'd put my money on it having to do with some sort of filtration method that makes this water taste the way it does. And that's not to say it tastes much different from regular water, the difference lays mainly in the consistency of it. I was surprised by the overall quality of it and I definitely like it enough to recommend it.

review/summary: convenient source of alkaline water
review/text: This water is based on the premise that many people experience an acid/alkaline imbalance.  In general, the western diet is more acid-producing, and there are issues that arise from a chronically acidic condition.  An approach to being overly acidic is to counter the acidity with alkaline foods.<br /><br />There is one school of thought that says alkaline water can't really change the pH of your cells because your body automatically maintains its own pH balance.  But maintaining a proper pH balance is difficult if you're constantly introducing acidic foods and drinks.<br /><br />Water can be either naturally alkaline or naturally acidic.  Chemically pure water is one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms connected by covalent bonds.  In nature, water dissolves many different substances which give it various tastes, odors and pH values.  Pure water has a pH between 6.81 and 7 depending on the temperature.  Water with a pH less than 7 is said to be acidic and water with a pH greater than 7 is basic or alkaline.<br /><br />A pH of 9.5 puts Essentia water somewhere between baking soda and milk of magnesia.  So this water is not just mildly alkaline - it is quite alkaline.  The taste is really quite pure.  I couldn't detect any off-taste or odors.  The water just tasted clean and pure.<br /><br />In my opinion, drinking a bottle or even a case of this water won't magically restore your body to an ideal pH level.  But it will induce your body to potentially counter an acidic state, particularly if you tend to be overly acidic.<br /><br />If you wanted to make your own alkaline water at home, you could do it by getting a good quality distilled water and mixing in a half teaspoon of baking soda.  This will give you water in the 8.5 to 9.0 range.  But I guess the benefit of drinking Essentia is that it's is purified through micro-filtration, UV lighting and reverse osmosis which rids it of chlorine and fluoride.  They also add minerals back in and restructure the water through ionic separation.  What is ionic separation?  In this case it is a process that creates smaller molecular clusters which support more rapid hydration.  But understand that water molecules don't organize unless there is an impurity in the water (hence my suggestion of making your own with distilled water).<br /><br />My verdict:  If you suspect or know you are overly acidic, Essentia could help make your body more alkaline (provided you are not negating the effects by continuing to consume mostly acidic items).  If convenience is what you're after, this water is going to be consistent and it will have a great taste.

review/summary: Like Drinking from a Mountain Stream
review/text: I'm not an expert on water but our household water is filtered and from a well so I'm used to drinking clean tasting water with no chlorine or anything else.<br /><br />Drinking the Essentia is like drinking fresh water from a mountain stream (minus the fish and debris!) It is soft, fresh, and refreshing.<br /><br />Would I spend a lot of money buying this? If I bought bottled water on a regular basis, I would probably choose this. It seems more pure in taste than traditional bottled water and had the added benefit of electrolytes.

review/summary: Got sick during the time I drank it
review/text: I was really looking forward to tasting the one bottle of water since I drink a lot of it (water). I buy Smart Water by the case. I have a sodium deficiency so need the electrolytes in the Smart water. I also live in a town that has no public water at all. We all have well water as our supply.<br /><br />This is a 1.5 bottle of water, which is a nice size. I drank it in one day and within that day I did get sick. I did not think it was the water until I read what alkaline water can do to you. I read, can't claim it, but read that the alkaline detoxes your body and neutralizes the acid in your stomach. We need acid in our stomach to process the food we eat. I read a lot of people that got sick drinking alkaline water, it might be a small percentage but I was one of them. Supposedly over time after it `cleanses' out yours system, you will feel better. With one bottle and getting sick, I cannot say that.<br /><br />It did taste good but not great. I could taste an aftertaste that was metallic like and it just did not seem crisp to me. I did finish the whole bottle, again in one day, but sadly would not buy this or drink this again if given a few more.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many additives, good or not, but yet no claims can be made or studies have been done to prove the benefits, I am leery.<br /><br />Yes it was good, not great, but getting so sick on the day I drank it and reading others that went through the same thing online is enough to keep me away.

review/summary: Pure Water
review/text: Water with a PH of 9.5 is very desirable, when you drink water this high of a PH your literally protecting yourself from many diseases. This is perfect for taking along with you on our walks or trips it will hydrate you much better than  ordinary filtered tap water.  Water is a very important substance that we put in our bodies and it has to be pure and balanced at least, this is not just balanced it is over the top.<br /><br />Essentia is as smooth as silk, soft and very refreshing. We used to have a natural spring near our summer home I used to go and fill our jugs up with water in a natural spring and this water reminds me of that spring water.<br /><br />I like this water and I would buy it for myself.

review/summary: It's Just Water
review/text: Whoever sells this makes a few claims that would be hard to verify without running some sort of scientific tests, such as the electrolyte thing and the 9.5 pH. But even if I assume that's all true, it still didn't do anything for me that regular water wouldn't--certainly not to an extent sufficient to assuage my guilt at using a non-biodegradable plastic bottle.<br /><br />I drank this 1.5 L bottle (Vine reviewers only get one) a glass at a time over the course of a few days, usually after running.  It was really no more refreshing than the water I usually drink out of my filtered tap. It quenched my thirst neither more quickly nor more slowly than usual. It tasted a bit different, but that's true any time I drink water that's not from my usual source. The taste was inoffensive, but I certainly wouldn't describe it as a "silky smooth taste," which is what the bottle promises.<br /><br />And what can I conclude from all of this? That the experience of drinking this liquid is, in fact, no different from that of drinking plain old WATER!

review/text: I drink water all day long. Usually plain out of the tap water. If it tasted like this I would not. Perhaps the electrolytes that they say are added provide some health benefit but they seem minimal and there are better ways to get them. This water had an almost metallic aftertaste (such as you get with over chlorination)Also at a hefty 1.5 liters the bottle is not a convenient size unless you plan on leaving it in the refrigerator to use.

review/summary: Delightfully surprised!
review/text: I am one of those people who is not good at drinking water.  I know that it is vitally important to drink plenty of water each and every day, but I have never been one who could make myself drink much of it.  It is because of this that I am always on the lookout for great water beverages and let me tell you, I have had little luck.  Most mix in leave an ick aftertaste because of the fake sugar.  I also greatly dislike carbonated drinks.  When I saw this Essentia product, I was very curious to give it a try.  Through the years, I have tried many different brands of bottled water.  Some have a "soapy" taste, some have just a plain weird taste and others are not bad.  Where does Essentia fall into?  I would have to say that it falls into a category that ranks high on my taste bud o meter.<br /><br />The bottle claims that it has a silky smooth taste.  I don't know if I would say that, but it does have a very crisp and fresh taste to it.  I spent the afternoon outside mowing (on a rather hot day) and when I came in, I cracked open the bottle of Essentia.  It was delicious.  Now, of course I was dying of thirst, lol.  An hour later I am nearly finished with the entire bottle! For me, that is amazing, lol.  I am really enjoying the way the water tastes (or lack of taste, whichever the case may be, lol)  I can honestly say that I will hopefully be purchasing more bottles of this in the very near future.  I have not seen it in stores around our area, so will probably order from Amazon.<br /><br />Bottom line, I am incredibly pleased with this water, look forward to enjoying it in the future and highly recommend it!!

It will last you a while if you are carrying it outside for work, sports, or outdoor activities.<br /><br />The manufactor uses a special technology to get a 9.5 ph. The bottle says, "purified water infused with electrolytes for a difference you can taste." it seems it can help hydrate, but I disagree with a part of the statement. The water taste good, yet it taste just like any other water in a bottle. My wife tried it and could not taste a difference either.

review/summary: Taste better cold. Has been chlorinated.
review/text: I would have preferred this be natural spring water but it was processed to come very close to a natural taste. As long as you get to near freezing temps. Hot and room temp reminded me of my mom's city water that is run off from the sewers which is highly chlorinated and filtered to kill bacteria. We have an artesian well for our own water than can not be beat for purity but this at least does not leave a bad taste like some bottled water we have tried. Upon opening I truly expected a profound odor. It was there, but not as bad as expected. We have had bottled water that had a fishy odor upon opening at room temp.<br /><br />This is not something I would choose to stock up on or consume in large quantities. Plain old water from a natural source is what nature intended for us anyway. Nothing is better for you than that.

review/summary: An Extraordinary Water
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I received this bottle of water from amazon. Our tap water tastes terrible, so we always drink the generic store-bought bottled water which is a cut above tap.<br /><br />Well, ESSENTIA bottled water is gorgeous.  To me it tastes like what fresh water from a spring would probably taste like.  It is so fresh tasting with absolutely no after-taste.  I don't know how they do it!  The label reads purified water with electolytes, so obviously this is not spring water, but it is a superior bottled water that I would highly recommend.  I'll definitely get this again.  A clean, fresh, wonderful tasting water.

review/summary: Very drinkable alkaline water
review/text: Without wading into the controversies surrounding the use of alkaline drinking water to improve body chemistry, I can share with you that this water is very drinkable in that it is largely indistinguishable from our tap water notwithstanding its "ionization" and the addition of electrolytes.  It did not upset my stomach or cause any other physical reaction, as is sometimes reported when using other alkaline water products.  If you're inclined to go alkaline, this product appears to be an effortless - if pricey - way to do so. The 1.5 liter size is perfect for a day at work, too.

review/summary: I like
review/text: Well, there really isn't much that you can write about a product that is as simple as water, so I'll try to keep this review brief. When it comes to bottled water, I either like their taste or I don't. The ones that I like are Desani and Nestle waters, with most of the other ones not making the cut. Essentia is definitely in the "like" category, so if you have a similar taste to mine you'll like this one as well. I've been reading about the benefits of 9.5 pH for your health, and they seem persuasive so if this is something that you might be interested in then I'd say to give this water a try. The 1.5 liter bottle is a bit too large for me, so I'd probably go for a smaller size (0.5 liter or so) in the future. I also like the sports bottle shape of the cap more, but I don't think that Essentia comes with those kinds of bottles. Overall, very satisfied.

review/summary: Simply Good Water
review/text: I am not a water expert.  In fact, I am one of those people who simply does not drink enough water.  Although I try to keep some at my desk and by my bedside, it can take me a week to get through a small bottle of water.  Instead I drink everything from milk to soda to coffee.  As such, I'm not going to talk much about PH levels and the various additives in this water.  Frankly, I don't really know much about that, and I'll leave that discussion to the experts.<br /><br />When I got the Essentia Water, I really wasn't expecting much.  I can say this:<br /><br />Taste - the water tastes good.  Since the water has an ingredients list containing lovely Latin terms for things I've never heard of, I was a bit afraid that there might be an aftertaste.  Nope - just tastes like very good, very clean water.<br /><br />Hydration - I felt refreshed and hydrated after drinking it.  LOL - I can't answer to the better sleep they advertise.  I have an energy-filled four-year-old who wakes me at odd intervals.  I can certainly say that I felt refreshed all day and the next day as well.<br /><br />In fact, when I opened the water that day, I shocked myself - I finished the whole 1.5 liter bottle!<br /><br />Bottom line - I liked the water and I've ordered more.  I see less sodas and more water in my future.  :-)

review/summary: I was surprised
review/text: Water.  It's sort of difficult to review because a lot of us take it for granted.  At home, I distill my own.  (We have well water which is high in minerals. Not good for coffee.)  I also tend to drink carbonated water instead of sodas so I'm very used to a neutral taste.<br /><br />When I received this sample I was first surprised at how large the bottle was.  Personally I like a large bottle as there's less recycling and I don't have to be constantly remembering to refrigerate the next bottle.<br /><br />The other thing that surprised me was how refreshing this water was.  I don't know about you but sometimes after doing something strenuous -like mowing an acre in 95-plus degree heat- water doesn't satisfy my thirst.  I can drink water until I slosh and I still feel dry.  With the Essentia I was happy after about half a bottle.  I drank the rest so that I was sure I was hydrated, but I wasn't 'dying of thirst' after drinking half.<br /><br />The one down side I had was that I thought the water had the slight flavor of the plastic container.  I liked the water enough though that I'm going to get another bottle at the grocery store and see if that was just a fluke.<br /><br />Pam T~

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Firstly I should mention that I only tested one bottle of this water, so as for long-term benefits of the 9.5 pH I can't really comment, but as for taste I can safely say it is a refreshing bottle of water. And I should also mention that I'm pretty picky about my water. Not all of it is created equal, that's for sure. Essentia certainly passes my Yum scale and feels plenty hydrating--although no more than my usual bottle of water, as far as I can tell.<br /><br />I like the 1.5 liter size because I like to keep a bottle of water handy pretty much all times, but do be aware that it's pretty big so if that's not what you want... keep it in mind.<br /><br />Overall, great tate, affordable price, maybe long-term benefits due to the bonus electrolytes and balanced pH. A great choice, IMO, but I wouldn't really consider it any more fantastic than other bottled water.

The 1.5 Liter bottle is more than I typically drink in one sitting, even after working out, so consumed my test bottle over two days.<br /><br />My first observation is that does taste significantly better than our municipal provided tap water and on par with the filtered water that we buy in bulk for regular "hydration" when working out. I did not notice any immediate quantifiable benefits from the adjusted pH or additives, but did feel more refreshed over drinking plain water.<br /><br />This is a reasonably priced alternative to sports drinks and regular bottled water!<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: Water water
review/text: This water is very refreshing - meaning it does have a nice `no-taste'. It's a bit better than my tap water; but luckily I live in an area where the water always comes out very high on `taste tests'.<br />It is refreshing and a bit clearer tasting but as for being worth paying a price for when good reliable tap water is available, I have my doubts. If you are not sure your water is good then this might be a better alternative; but quite frankly on an environmental scale of avoiding an overabundance of plastic bottles, I would rather see it sold in bigger containers where a consumer could refill their own - traveling is another matter.<br /><br />As for the ph. of 9,5...Pure distilled water contains an equal number of H+ and OH- ions and is considered neutral (at pH 7), neither basic nor acidic. It might pay you in the long run to see what your local water's ph. is. Ours is ph. 8. I'm not sure if that little bit in a ph. difference would matter. It seems as if most of the claims this company makes for its water would be cured by drinking more of any good clean water - which granted this is, it just costs more than good tap water.

review/text: It is important to note that this is not bottled spring water like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9HM6G">Evian Bottled Water 24 bottles 11.2oz</a>. (Incidentally, Evian spelled backwards is naive.) Instead this is water that has been purified and then supplemented with calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate and sodium to adjust the pH of the water. So if you are on a low-sodium diet, you probably don't want to drink this.<br /><br />When I drank this water, I immediately noted the rather bland taste. The truth is I prefer the taste of the filtered water from my refrigerator water filter or my Quixtar filter. However if you feel the health benefits of pH balanced water are legitimate and worth the investment, then this product may be for you.

review/text: Good tasting water.  This is a big bottle of water; 1.5 liters is equivalent to about 4 soda cans or 6 glasses of water.  Plastic bottle is not as flimsy as most water bottle which crumples on your hand.  Normal PH level of water is between 6.5 to 8.5, whereas pure water is 7 and  less than 6.5 PH may be acidic or called soft.  Acidic is considered not good for your heath if it is what you drink most of the time.  Hard water is above 8.5 PH, and considered not so much of a risk to your health than acidic.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of water bottles, this is a good alternative for many of the popular brands already in the market.

review/text: I doubt that Essentia water can truly provide some of the health benefits that it claims. It claims that it promotes normal blood pressure, provides restful sleep, promotes good heart health and increases muscle strength. However it has a nice taste and I enjoy drinking it.<br /><br />It certainly tastes a 100 times better than tap water and it tastes better that the average bottled water. There is only one brand that I like slightly better. One big difference about this water is the size of the bottle. The average bottled water is 16.9 oz. This bottle is 1.5L and it perfect for me. I usually drink a lot of bottled water when working outside in the heat or while exercising. I can down a regular bottle of water in a few seconds but this bottle will last me a while.<br /><br />The cost per bottle is a little on the high side but you have to factor in the size of the bottle. Each Essentia bottle is equal to 3 1/2 regular size bottles. That being said the cost is still a little on the high side but that is the case with all of the higher quality bottled waters.

review/summary: A more natural taste.
review/text: Let me first say that the packaging looks different than what it shows on the website. It looks and feels antiquated. But what matters is what is inside, correct?<br />I tasted essential against 3 other waters. One was a simply filtered water (from refrigerator disperser), another had minerals added- bottled water, and the other one was tap water (which tastes different depending on what part of the country and even in different municipalities).<br />Lets just say that essentia won...here are the differences from worst to best:<br />- Tap water: let's just say its like taking a big gulp of pool water...you know that chlorinated taste.<br />- regular bottled water (from local non-spring source, reverse osmosis, destilled, and minerals added): it's tasted like any other bottled water. It's ok and this should be the base standard.<br />- Filtered water (from my refrigerator): I might be biased but the filter does a good at removing chlorine and particulate without removing some minerality, it tastes fresh and clean.<br />- Essentia (aka, the winner): the mouthfeel is smooth and it coats your mouth, it doesn't weight heavy on you, I guess this might be the electrolytes or PH balance. It was pleasant and reminds me of spring water but not necessarily "refreshing". I believe it will serve its purpose vs some of the sports drinks out there.<br />The other thing that bothered me was all the health claims that they make. I guess you could make those for water in itself. At the end of the day I would go for natural spring water over any other source/method of bottled water.

review/summary: Nice clean bottled water with faint mineral taste
review/text: I normally drink NYC tap water which has a great flavor.  It comes from beautiful reservoirs upstate and is closely monitored for safety.<br /><br />When I do drink mineral water, I will almost invariably choose something like Vichy or Apollinaris with a bit of flavor and some bubbles.<br /><br />However, this Essentia water is quite good for a lightly-mineralized non-gaseous bottled water.  It does have a very faint soft mineral taste on the tongue which might not even be noticed under ordinary circumstances.<br /><br />It comes in a large 1.5 liter bottle that is surprisingly easy to grip and pour and I really like the fact that it is filtered and treated with UV light.  It would be good to keep on hand for emergencies.<br /><br />I am a little skeptical about any advantages of the 9.5 pH except as it affects the taste.  I would think that the gastric acid in the stomach would make the pH of this water irrelevant instantly.

review/summary: Wonderful taste!
review/text: This is definitely one of the better bottled waters I have tasted. It has a crisp clean flavor that tastes more like a distilled water than a spring water. It doesn't have a soft taste, which I find many bottled waters do have. It reminds me more of the flavor of Dasani or Aquafina bottled water over softer ones like Fiji water. Each 1.5 liter bottle is huge, so keep that in mind when comparing price to number of bottles. These are much larger than you would drink in one sitting. Very delicious cold, right out of the refrigerator!

review/summary: Tastes Great
review/text: This is one of the best tasting waters that I've tried. It is just purified water and not spring water but it has such a pure tasting taste to it. It is enhanced with minerals and honestly, I can taste the mineral taste which I like. Funny that a good tasting water is different from most drinks that we consume. Water is one that we want without any taste or flavor - just pure, fresh, wet and clean. Essentia is one without any noticeable flavors but the mineral taste.<br /><br />I really liked it and gave it to my family too. They were surprised with a yum which isn't really a reaction that I normally get from water.<br /><br />It has 9.5 pH factor and infused with electrolytes. Can't really tell those things from drinking it but good to know. Recommending completely on taste. It's excellent tasting water.

review/summary: It's water...with some extras added.
review/text: This water is what the description says...smooth, and jolted with some extra minerals to help out after a hard workout.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Water, baking soda, dipotassium phosphate (salt that dissolves very easily; this also controls acidity), magnesium sulfate (epsom salt) and calcium chloride.<br /><br />My original take before drinking the water was "why on earth can't we just eliminate all the ingredients except for...you know...that water?"  Well, after downing 50.7 ounces after a workout where I was dripping wet with sweat, I think I can answer my own question.  No, the water didn't taste better or magically make me feel like I didn't just workout.  But, as an alternative to Powerade or Gatorade, drinking a bunch of this Essentia water to restore electrolytes is MUCH better than all the Red #40 and High Fructose Corn Syrup you'll find in the flavored junk.<br /><br />Recommend...

review/summary: Tastes Great & I love the size...
review/text: I am very picky about flavors of water.  There's only about 2-3 out there that I care for.  My favorite brand and the only bottled water that I purchase is Nestle Pure Life.  This tates very similar to me.  I love the flavor and I do think it's silky, smooth as described.  I have zero complaints about the flavor.<br /><br />This size of the bottle is perfect for me when I'm outside for long periods of time like doing yard work or playing outdoor games.  It's a great size to take to sporting events too.  The only thing it's not handy for is my walking.  I walk daily and always take a bottle of water with me but this is a bit too big and bulky for that.<br /><br />I can't really give any feedback on the benefits that it lists such as sleeping better and helping to maintain normal blood pressure because I haven't used it for an extended periord of time but if it does those things then it's just an added bonus for me.  I would buy it simply for the taste.  I don't think the current price is bad at all.<br /><br />I would recommend this water.

review/summary: Good to have on a long hot motorcycle ride
review/text: I figured a 450-mile mid-August motorcycle ride would be a good way to evaluate Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, so I poured a bottle of it into my CamelBak and set off from my home in northeast Arkansas for Indianapolis and the MotoGP races last Thursday morning.<br />The stuff kept me well hydrated and clear-headed all the way to Indy, which was a very good thing because we were overtaken by torrential rains just as we reached the city and had to negotiate flooding streets and rush-hour traffic to reach our motel, which wasn't where we remembered it because the interchange has been reconfigured.<br />Throughout it all, I never felt the "out of it" fatigue that goes with dehydration on a hot day. It's also easier on my stomach than regular tap water or ordinary bottled water.<br />Essentia will be my water of choice for future hot weather rides.

review/summary: Better Than Spring Water
review/text: I know most people think water is...plain as water.  If you don't notice any difference between Fiji water, Poland Springs, and NJ tap water, then you might be right.  Personally, I notice a big difference.  Fiji, comes from aquifers that run below the Earth's surface unlike spring water.  It has a high silicon content that gives it a fuller body and I like the taste of it much more than most bottled waters.  Essentia is filtered water that is "enhanced" to the point where it has a similar feel and flavor to Fiji.  I can't say I notice a difference due to the pH, but sure, that sounds nice I guess.  Overall, I like Essentia's mineral taste and silky texture.  It is free from chlorine and flouride that plague a lot of tap water.  The BPA, Phthalate free bottle is great too since i have young children.

We do want to stress that we did like the water, but not for this price. I'll stick to my filtered/bottled water.

review/summary: Great water, don't know about health claims
review/text: There are a few things I do know, the normal PH for water is 7.0 when neutral. I also know that a ph of above 10 or below 3 will kill the fish in my pond. So I wouldn't recommend adding it to your goldfish bowl.<br /><br />But I have also read articles on the fact that our American diet leads to acidity, and we can help compensate by drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />So if you feel like this is a product that is helpful, this water tastes like water and does all of the same things water does. I drank a huge glass before bedtime, and sure enough, it got me up in the middle of the night. Interestingly, I did drop a full pound of water weight overnight as well, but I can't be sure it was caused by the water, although I will be repeating the experiment.

I didn't particularly find it any more refreshing than any other water. I don't know if I truly felt the effects of the "best available pH" (9.5). It did have a pretty silky feel to it as I drank it. It is supposed to have electrolytes in it so if you want to be able to have hard workouts in the heat where electrolytes are truly needed and you don't want the sweet taste of sports drinks or Vitamin Water AND you don't mind the high price, this may be for you.

review/summary: Similar flavor to tap water, but a very unique perceived texture.
review/text: This water tastes very similar to tap water or cheap bottled water, but definitely has a different texture when you drink it.  The taste is clean and crisp, but without the flavor of more expensive bottled waters that have minerals added for flavor.  It tastes very similar to Aquafina or Nestle bottled water.<br /><br />The big difference is in the perceived texture of the water as you drink it.  It has a smooth almost saline-like texture that is enjoyable when cold.  It tastes almost salty when warm.<br /><br />I probably won't go out of my way to get this water again, but if I saw it in a display case at a store, I would drink it again just for the variety of it.  I recommend that you try it, to see what I mean, but am not confident that you will be hooked (I wasn't).

review/summary: It tastes... like nothing.  Refreshing to drink after a 5 mile walk.
review/text: The bottle I received was a 1.5 liter size.  Very large (I have a photo at the top).  I usually get more manageable sizes to take with me when I walk/jog - a size that fits in the cup holder of my stroller.  Anyway I thought I'd give this a shot today since I was going for a longer jaunt, a 5 mile combined jog / walk with my stroller and perhaps I'd want more than just one small water bottle.<br /><br />The bottle size actually made it so I drank less because I had to store it in the bottom of the stroller and it wasn't readily available... so I only drank half of it and that was consumed at the end of my outing.  But I sort of felt more energized after drinking it - and I was quite pooped after 5 miles of pushing the stroller.  I don't know if that was psychological because I knew there were electrolytes in it or if there really was more of a boost.<br /><br />I can't comment too much on if the pH is of any benefit or not, I understand you have to drink this for awhile before any benefit kicks in... HOWEVER I did a quick search online to see if I could read anything from an independent source telling me why 9.5 pH or a higher pH in general is good for you and I couldn't find anything EXCEPT websites that were trying to sell me their products.  I couldn't find a website to tell me WHY this was good that WASN'T trying to sell me anything and that had some credibility.  So please keep that in mind.  One of the websites that was trying to sell me their pH stuff sited some "Japanese study" but gave no specifics... so I could not even look that study up to verify anything.  So it sort of leaves me to believe the pH thing may be a fad.  Probably a harmless one though.<br /><br />Bottom line... water tasted good.  I like the electrolyte thing.  Don't care much about the pH, think that may be silly.

review/summary: Good cold. Dubious marketing claims
review/text: This is marketed the same way that toothpaste is ("doctor recommended"), which for me, has the opposite effect on credibility. Strangely, this product does not have the usual FDA disclaimer that I've seen on other products ("This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA").<br /><br />Evaluating this water just as a water, apart from the numerous health benefit claims, it's good. When at room temperature, the taste is a bit strange and off-putting. When refrigerated and served cold, it is very refreshing and clean tasting. Not sure what "Best available pH at 9.5" means.. This statement does not make sense. pH is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of 0-14 (0 being a strong acid, 14 being a strong base). Normal water is neutral at 7. "Hydrates better" than what? What are we comparing this to? Hydrates better than an English muffin? Yes, it certainly does!<br /><br />Most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning.. Plastic is type 1 PETE and can be easily recycled, but most beverage bottles are made of #1 or #2. I'm not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus. These bottles have to be shipped across the country, using trucks and airplanes, which is not carbon neutral. It is far more environmentally friendly to get a filter/treatment system and drink your local water supply.

review/summary: Great Hydration!
review/text: I'm not an athlete.  I've read through the reviews of this from the athletes, and if I were an athlete it would probably be a big deal in my mind.  On the other hand, I'm like everyone and get sick from time to time.  From being ill, I was dehydrated.  My doctor immediately told me to start drinking Gatorade or PediaSure.  I have never liked flavored sports drinks.  I hate the fact that when I am already not feeling well, I have to drink something I can't stand the flavor of.  I had previous tried SmartWater to solve this issue, but it doesn't seem to be infused with enough electrolytes to help.  So, this time I tried Essentia.  After about 2 liters, I did feel better.  You know that sorta dry, swollen tongue thing that happens when you are dehydrated?  That went away.  I felt a little stronger between drinking this and taking my medicine.  I asked the doctor if this was okay to drink instead of Gatorade and he gave me the go ahead.  So, here is what I liked:<br /><br />1.  It pretty much tastes like water.  There is a slight difference in taste from something like Brita water, or most bottled water, but overall it's not a taste that drives me away.<br /><br />2.  It is not sugary!  This is what drives me away from Gatorade.  I hate the sugary taste of every one of their flavors.  Since this basically tastes like water, it is not sugary!  This is the aspect that makes me dance for joy.<br /><br />3.  It made me feel hydrated after a bottle.  Honestly, it was probably less than a bottle.  If I wasn't already extremely dehydrated, it would have been even less than that.  I love it when something makes you just feel better.<br /><br />4.  It is a sporty water bottle that is made from environmentally safe products.  I'm not a total Go Green girl, but it is definitely a plus and something I am becoming more aware of.  I know that several of my high school athletes are very big in the Green shopping, so this is something I would recommend it.  It's also good plastic that is easily recycled again.<br /><br />The biggest con is the price.  It's not unheard of for a 12 pack of water to be expensive, but it is definitely not a drink the average family would be able to purchase several times a week.  A single bottle is just slightly more expensive than Gatorade, but a 12 pack for about $25 is much different than the supermarket brand of water that is a 24 pack for $4.00.  This is water that is for the electrolytes and rehydrating after a sickness or big work out, not an every day drinking water.

In fact, it is different enough from regular water (from the tap or bottled water) that I would consider serving it as a special beverage with a meal.<br /><br />It is expensive, but for those who want the best-tasting water and can afford the luxury, this is an excellent choice.

Essentia 9.5 pH drinking water has no taste & is very good. Taste wise Essentia 9.5 pH compares to the water I get from my faucet using the New Wave Enviro filter. However, Essentia is enhanced with pure minerals & promotes its 9.5 pH alkalinity.<br /><br />I don't know if there have been any scientific studies on the benefits of drinking alkaline water.  My internet search was inconclusive.<br /><br />If you are looking for an alkaline bottled water with a pH of 9.5, Essentia won't disappoint you.

review/text: I noticed nothing different about the flavor or lightness/heaviness of this water. It was water.  I tested the ph and it real only 8.4, which is still better than tap water, but they advertise 9,5.  I will say that my test may not have been wholly accurate, but because I had only one bottle, I couldn't check it against another bottle not run several tests to see what the consistent measurement will .

review/summary: First I was thirsty, then I was not.
review/text: For most bottled waters, there are basically two elements that are required for quality.  First, does it quench the thirst?  Yes, of course it does, it's water.  Second, does it taste good?  Again, yes, it does.<br /><br />However, there are more benefits to this pH drinking water, apparently, than the standard water.  According to its product description: "Its superior hydrating qualities come from a special electrolyte formula and optimal pH level of 9.5, which gives your body more of what it needs to thrive. Drinking Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system and helps bring your body back into balance. It also helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more."<br /><br />Do any of these claims come true?  It's hard to tell, but I know it didn't make me feel any LESS healthy.

review/summary: It's water... Yep....
review/text: So I had the chance to try this water out, and I have to admit it seems like if there was going to be a health benefit you would need to drink it often. I received one bottle and I had some of it. The water tastes like purified water. Theres no weird chemical flavors  or plastic flavors. There is no odor and it tastes clean. It reminds me a lot of Smart Water.<br /><br />I can't confirm if there are positive health impacts, I haven't had enough to show that I'm sure. But I can confirm it tastes just like water and if you are looking for something with a pH level of 9.5 this appears to be it...<br /><br />Is it a buy/try or don't buy? I'd say you can give it a try.

review/summary: Tastes fine, but what's the benefit of alkaline water again?
review/text: I received one bottle of this water to review. It tastes just fine, not a lot of flavor from the added minerals in the bottle. This seems to be some preliminary attempt at the alkaline bottled water market. The label indicates "pH is 9.5 +/- (purified waters require calibrated pH meter for testing)" which implies to me that they don't yet have a calibrated meter... Anyhow, the health benefits, if any, of the water are hard to assess. Most mineral waters have more flavor and are also going to be moderately alkaline.

review/summary: Water with benefits and no funny aftertaste
review/text: My job has me running around on my feet for 8 hours a day so it's important that I stay hydrated.  Lately I have been drinking whatever I bring from home (usually something similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026I0O14">Propel Fitness Water</a>) or just water from the dispenser.  The thing I've noticed with the sports drinks are that they actually leave me thirstier and water usually leaves me full once I'm able to drink enough to quench my thirst.<br /><br />I did read some of the reviews before deciding to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0">Essentia 9.5 pH</a> and based on them being mostly positive I wanted to give it a try. The bottle I received lasted me the entire day at work and I didn't have to go searching for more which was nice. The taste was much better than tap and even better than the bottled dispenser water we have.  As for the claims of "helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more" I can't really prove or disprove them after just one bottle. The only thing I can say is that I did feel like it quenched my thirst better than anything I've been drinking. Is it all in my imagination? I don't think so, which is why I've actually purchased more from my local grocery store (the price was just a bit better than here on Amazon).

review/summary: Very tasty water
review/text: I have taste electrolite infused water once before and I loved it. I have no idea what the brand name was. This tasted the same. It literally makes me want to drink more. I have been scared off from drinking tap water as I have some auto-immune diseases and now qualfy as "older" (I hate that tag, elderly).<br /><br />We periodically receive reports from the city about what they find in our water. It says in the report that we should stop buying water. But it also has the warning about if you have an weakened immune system, are elderly, undergoing treatment involving steriods that you may be more vulnerable to certain protoza. Cryptosporidium is one that they warn against. It has been shown to be absent for several years and a person who has a weakened immune system should recover in two weeks. But the report also says the reason that the water doesn't taste well and look OK is because of algal bloom. Algal bloom can be bad for dogs and lambs so should I still drink it? I don't trust it so I don't.<br /><br /> When I tasted this water, it tasted so much better. All I can go by is taste. It tastes clean.<br /><br />I docked the rating by one star because of the cost. I still don't think I could afford it. I tried filters for a while but the filters were so expensive. If I could afford it I would definitely sign up for the subscribe and save.<br /><br />At least until it is gone, I can enjoy the water so clean tasting that I want to drink more.<br /><br />I highly recommend this water, it is so good that it is a treat to drink.

review/summary: It is OK, but there is something that I can taste...
review/text: There is not much to say about water, I enjoy bottled water and always buy the packs of Dasani Bottled water from the local store.  I saw this item and thought it would be nice to give something else a try.  I poured me a glass of this water (I have had it chilling in the fridge for the day), and tried it, it tasted OK, and the water appeared beyond clear (kind of strange how clear the water was), it did have a small flavor or something, but I was not sure.  After I finished the glass I could still taste something in my mouth, it had an almost bitter flavor.  I got some tap water and washed my mouth out and that got rid of that bitterness.<br /><br />I am not sure what I am tasting in this water, but whatever it is, I do not care for it.  The bitterness is something I have tasted before, but cannot remember.  I think I will stick with Dasani or tap water.  This may just be my tastebuds and you may not have a problem with this water, but I could taste something and I did not like it.

review/summary: Hey, it's H20 with a twist
review/text: Water with a Ph of 9.5 is thought to help with many physical ailments (Google it) as well as hydrate better, especially after strenuous activity. I've never seen much of a difference using sports drinks vs cold water, but many people do. This drink would be a much cheaper alternative to those $1 and $2 sports drinks. It does have a different "texture" than regular water, perhaps because of the Ph level.<br /><br />There is no source specified, so I assume it's from tap water.  The source does not really matter to me. Many of the springs in this country are becoming contaminated, and those that draw water from "mountain streams" - eeewww!  Animals and people use those as a bathroom, and things die and rot there.  The bottom line is that ALL water get filtered thoroughly, no matter the source, and it all starts in the same place.  That's personal preference, but I'm not paying a premium for "spring" water that's going to be filtered anyway!

There is no chemical taste, and no aftertaste either good or bad. It doesn't taste fresh like spring water that's bubbling up from its source, but I don't find myself near a spring very often and no taste is better than bad taste. It comes in a large plastic bottle that is sturdy enough to reuse.

review/summary: Tastes like water. HUGE bottle!
review/text: I'm basing my review on this being what it says it is. It's water! Yep! It sure is, and that is exactly what it tastes like.  Read on :)  It's got electrolytes! YES! I am going to have to believe that because as I said, it tastes like water. I love the idea of electrolytes in anything and if you do too, then this is for you. Rather than feeling like you always have to grab a bottle of Gatorade (which is sugary, flavored, chemical-ish tasting) you can grab WATER! Perfect for after workouts, at work, any time!<br /><br />If you read the ingredients (purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride) you might wonder what all of that is doing in there. I do. But I'm not a scientist and not sure what makes up electrolytes. It has zero calories, fat, sodium (with sodium bicarbonate in it?) zero carbs, zero protein. So I'm going by what the bottle says, it's electrolyte water. Yeah!<br /><br />It's a huge bottle, one I plan to recycle by filling with water from my fridge! Which brings me to the other claim on the bottle. It says 'For a difference you can taste." Well, to me, this tastes like my fridge water. No better, no worse, no different. I had actually considered taking off one star for this, but then I recalled my high school health class that said 'you can interpret sales/marketing one way "This is the best toothpaste ever!" or another. Who is to say what it's the BEST of? WHO says? Etc. So I can't taste any difference from my fridge water, like I can with my favorite waters <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013T5YO4">FIJI Natural Artesian Water, 50.7 -Fl.  Oz  Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S891KU">NEO Water - 9.5pH Alkaline, Electrolyte, Antioxidant Water 20 OZ (24 Case) - Alkaline Water - Electrolyte Water - Antioxidant Water - PH Water - BPA Free Plastic</a> but who is to say that's bad? But aha! It says on the bottle it has a 'silky smooth taste' Well, in my opinion, the Fiji water really, really does! This doesn't at all, but that could just be my opinion of what silky smooth water should be.<br /><br />SO if you love water, and want something added to it that will help you refresh, refuel, get better etc...and want it to just taste like water...then this is totally for you. At 50.7 fluid ounces, and with a nice sturdy bottle, you won't be disappointed.

It is purified water with electrolytes, which to me I would prefer my water to be like this, than electrolytes like they have in Gatorade.<br /><br />If I were to drink bottled water I would drink this water, because of the electrolytes, so that you don't get dehydrated.

review/summary: Water-flavoured alkaline electrolyte beverage.
review/text: Essentia is water with electrolytes and a pH of 9.5. It is basically an alkaline unflavoured sports drink.  Essentia tastes just like regular water; it's not soapy, nor metallic tasting like some would suspect looking at the 9.5 pH label.<br /><br />The whole alkaline water discussion falls into 2 camps that is really beyond the scope of this review.  To summarize, one camp believes it helps against cancer, and promotes longevity etc by following an alkaline diet, the other is calling BS on the psuedoscience of creating "pure" alkaline water through osmosis and ionizing water. There is also a large number of middle-of-the-road people that are just using it for convenience to help with GERD instead of popping a pepcid or carrying around a box of bicarb.<br /><br />One important note is that this water is sourced from many sources (including municipal) and is treated water, which does rank lower than water sourced from a natural untreated and untampered spring.  However, Essentia does taste good and whatever other people's stance is on the alkaline water/diet issue, it can't hurt to just drink more water.<br /><br />I love water. It is my favourite drink and would not hesitate to buy this brand of water if given the choice alongside other altered/treated waters in the same price range.

review/summary: Water, Water Everywhere
review/text: 'A Difference You Can Taste' is the slogan for this water. It boasts that it has a ph factor of 9.5 and claims that it hydrates. Under normal circumstances I drink bottled water because the tap water here is not especially palatable since it is well water.  My bottled water of choice is normally whatever is on sale and I usually am of the opinion that the brands don't vary much. If it doesn't have a taste all the better<br />The good news is that Essentia doesn't have a taste per se. It is fresh tasting and does not have a funky or mineral aftertaste. To me it is a pricey version of what I normally drink. Does it hydrate or contain electrolytes? I have absolutely no idea.<br />My son swears by Essentia however and buys large amounts of it at Whole Foods. He has terrible acid reflux  and claims it is way better than Gatorade and far more satisfying and has even reduced his acid reflux issues.<br />Since I am not a runner and I don't like Gatorade, I'm sticking with plain old bottled water.

review/text: The product tastes great.  It tastes like higher end bottled water.  One reviewer called the taste "silky" and I can't think of a better description for it.  It goes down smooth, that's for sure.<br /><br />I'm unsure about certain aspects of this water.  On the one hand, I wish I would have had some during the times my youngest suffered from acid reflux or when anyone in the household suffered from an upset stomach.  On the other, I'm concerned that drinking too much of it will cause an imbalance with stomach acids, causing further digestion problems.<br /><br />I do think this is an excellent product overall for those who need it. For me, I'm probably going to keep a bottle or two on hand for upset stomachs.  I don't think I will be drinking it daily or replacing my current water-of-choice with it.

review/text: I am in love with Essentia! This water tastes very smooth, and keeps me hydrated for a very long time. Living in a hot and humid environment, I need all the hydration I can get, and Essentia didn't let me down. I felt the effects within an hour-hydration anyway. I don't have any real health problems, and the idea that just water can cure health problems seems a bit much, and none of these claims have been proven. However, for a bottled water, I very much enjoyed this.<br /><br />While I should say the texture is smooth, and not thick, there is no odd aftertaste that most bottled waters give you. It tastes as I imagine pure drinking water should. This leaves behind no odd coating of the tongue that annoys me in most bottled waters, and it goes down very well. My mouth even feels more refreshed after drinking it!<br /><br />The price isn't too bad for what you get either. The bottles are insanely huge for a typical bottled water.<br /><br />I plan on buying more of this water, as it was even better, to me, than Smart Water, and I used to swear by them!

review/summary: wonderful - UPDATE
review/text: This water was bottled at 9.5 and although by the time it reaches us its probably closer to 8.5, that is still excellent. My body absorbs this water much better than any other, I drink just as much but urinate half as much as before. I use it in my soups, coffee, etc. This water and replacing standard refined table salt with pink himalayan salt in my diet has increased my energy 10-fold. This may not be the magic bean for everyone's body, but I love it. Tastes silky smooth too.<br /><br />**UPDATE Sept 2012** - I ordered 3 types of bottled high-ph water: NeoWater, AlkaPure, and Essentia, then tested them with PH testing strips. The Essentia water tested at 9.0, the AlkaPure at 9.3, and the NeoWater at 7.1! Thanks, Essentia, for ensuring the quality of your water. I remain a happy customer :) I'll try to post the picture of the tests to the product page.

review/summary: Slight unpleasant chemical aftertaste
review/text: In the old days, water was water. Now days, consumers have their choice of bottled or tap, sparkling or flat, distilled or spring, and a hundred other options too complex for most to care about. In this case, Essentia is marketed as pH balanced at 9.5, meaning it is significantly alkaline (basic in the old parlance - the opposite of acidic) compared to traditional water, which falls roughly around 7 pH (give or take). Various websites will extol the virtues of this sort of waters, while others call it bunk. To me, however, all that matters is the flavor.<br /><br />Essentia water lives up to its label - it does have a silky smooth taste (or lack thereof). The problem is, it also has a slight chemical aftertaste that is most likely due to the added sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and calcium chloride. I also experienced a mild dry mouth after drinking it which I attribute to drinking an alkaline substance in a mouth that generally runs either very slightly acidic or very slightly basic. These aspects are enough for me not to drink it anymore, though I have had significantly worse-tasting water.<br /><br />Rating: 2 out of 5 stars. The mild chemical aftertaste is too much for me, but it still tastes better than Dasani.

review/summary: tastefully different
review/text: I'm not quite sure how to explain this, because it is water...but there is a kind of a different "taste" to it, and also a different texture as well. I've not really known much about the pH of water, what should or shouldn't be desired, but somehow, this water was just....different, in the best sort of way. If they sold this everywhere, I'd definitely buy it. It is more than worth "investing" in, AND you get quite a bit of water. The one bottle I received to try it out lasted me quite a while, for it being a water bottle.<br /><br />In addition to a difference in "taste" and texture - I know that sounds weird, but you'd have to drink it to get what I mean....and not just chug it, but to really enjoy the water as you slowly consume it - I honestly feel it better hydrates and keeps the body hydrated. I've not experimented yet, but I could tell that (as active as I was while consuming most of this water,) I felt hydrated faster and longer, longer both during the physical activity and afterwards, too. It seemed to replenish (during and after) what I was losing/what I had lost in the end. I felt satisfied. The water almost had the same kind of feel that drinking other kinds of vitamin waters with electrolytes have on my body. Granted, I wouldn't TOTALLY replace those electrolytes with this water, but it seemingly had the same/similar kind of feel/affect on me.<br /><br />I enjoy(ed) it and would most definitely recommend someone looking into this and trying it out!

review/summary: Tasted nice and seems to hydrate well
review/text: Now I know that you can't guarantee how much electrolytes are in a product for certain without taking it to a lab and testing it. Since this was one of my main reasons for sampling this, this was the main thing I tested for in my daily routine.<br /><br />Taste-wise, this is good. It tastes like water and is better than the city water I get from my tap. However I do want to state that I can get similar tastes from other bottled waters on the market. This actually didn't impress me that overly much because for the most part you can get ultra-filtrated fancy water from many different sources. You need a little something extra to really stand out.<br /><br />That's where the electrolytes come in. To really test this I drank portions of this at the gym while I was doing my cardio, as good hydration can often make for a better workout. The water was pretty refreshing and it felt like it made a difference from the water I usually get from the water fountain by the changing rooms. It just didn't seem to make such an overwhelming difference that I'd rush out the door to buy another bottle as soon as I emptied this one.<br /><br />Would I buy this on my own? Under certain circumstances, yes. It's not a "must buy", but if I was sick and needed to rehydrate, I'd get this as an alternative to straight electrolytes. I'd also get it if I was in a store, was thirsty, and this was available. It's good enough that I'd buy it again for the most part. I just wouldn't write home about it.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting Water Free of BPA and Chlorine
review/text: I was attracted by the claims that water is highly purified, has no chlorine or fluoride, and contains electrolytes. I found the taste to be pleasant and comparable to distilled water, which I usually purchase in 3-gallon jugs. I have had water-borne parasites (contracted here in the USA, probably from tap water) so pure water is important to me.<br /><br />I am downgrading this by one star because the claims seem a bit overblown. I mean, what does "Restructured through ionic separation" mean anyway? And "Hydrates better" than what?<br /><br />I'm glad that Essentia water comes in "BPA and Phthalate free recyclable bottles" and does not need to be shipped in from overseas. I believe in conserving natural resources while protecting health.<br /><br />Recently we moved to a home with well water. I thought this would be a blessing because I don't like the taste of chlorine. Unfortunately our well produces water that tastes bad and often stinks, even after going through a fancy conditioning system. So I only drink bottled water. I would purchase this water again if the price were comparable to the water I buy now.

review/summary: Seems to me it's just water
review/text: To me this seems to be little more than just water. Could it deliver special benefits that I am unaware of? That are tasteless, odorless and colorless? It certainly could. And the makers of the water claim that it does. But there is no way for me to tell. So I cannot recommend this product.

review/summary: Seems to Provide Good Hydration After a Workout. Still A Little Skeptical, But Worth Trying if You are a Bottled Water Drinker.
review/text: Until I saw & read about 9.5 pH drinking water, I didn't know that I "needed" it.  I've read the information provided by the manufacturer and tried a 1.5 liter bottle, and still am not convinced that 9.5 pH is a "must have".  I can't say that the Essentia is better than my go-to filtered water, but I also can't say that my go-to filtered water is better either.  However, if you are a bottled water drinker anyway, Essentia may be a product for you to try.<br /><br />I drank 1/2 of the bottle after 2 separate workouts. After the first workout, I drank filtered water & still felt thirsty.  I decided to try the Essentia & it did quench my thirst. After the second work-out, I just drank the last of the Essentia & it seemed to quench my thirst.<br /><br />Taste-wise, I cannot tell any difference between Essentia and filtered water.  I detected no metallic taste.<br /><br />The Essentia seemed to "fill" my mouth a little more, but, with sampling only 1 bottle, I may have just been my imagination.<br /><br />If you are a bottled water drinker, Essentia is a product to try to see if it works for you.  If you are a filtered water drinker, your experience may be that your filtered water is just fine.

review/summary: Tastes silky smooth as advertised.
review/text: I normal drink Costco Kirkland water, it is my favorite bottled water. Drinking the two waters back to back, the Kirkland water does taste a bit more bitter than the Essentia. Like the bottle says, Essentia has a silky smooth taste to it. The bottle also says it hydrates better and it is electrolyte infused. I normally drink Gatorade for electrolytes, but I was told by a friend not to drink too much because of the extra salt in gatorade for when you sweat. They use salt as an electrolytes. But regardless, this is a better alternative to gatorade and it tastes good too.<br /><br />If you need your electrolytes this is probably way better than a sports drink. The nutrition facts states 0g of sodium, 0g of fat, 0 calories. But that is the same in all water isn't it?<br /><br />The bottle also states: "doctor recommended to protect, improve and enhance the quality of your health" I don't know if that is this water or water in general that is doctor recommended.<br /><br />In the end, I think I will stick to kirkland because it is way cheaper and the only thing it looks to be different is Essentia is electrolyte infused and kirkland is infused with minerals.

review/summary: As water goes, it's good. As a cure, it's hard to tell...
review/text: It's hard to review the efficacy of a product like Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water after consuming just 1.5L (the sample size provided to Vine reviewers), so let's just say that as a water product goes, there's nothing either extraordinary or offensive about this H2O. The bottler went to a lot of work to fine tune the chemistry and flavor of this product (micro-filtration, UV lighting, reverse osmosis, mineral "enhancement" and something called ionic separation), but you're going to be disappointed if you pour a glass and expect it to taste like, umm, robust good health. Essentia's 9.5 pH Drinking Water tastes like...water, albeit with that trademark flat metallic taste that comes from altering the ingredient list a little.<br /><br />Is it worth the price? For somebody enduring the daily torment of GERD, I'd say it's definitely worth a try. Does it work? You'll have to rely on other reviewers to make that call.

review/summary: I have to admit -- this is good bottled water.
review/text: So, I don't normally drink bottled water. I'm not convinced the benefits of 'vapor distilled' or 'enhanced with minerals' offsets the obvious drawbacks of the chemicals & waste of using plastic bottles.<br /><br />HOWEVER -- I sampled this product through the Vine program, and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />+ : This water tastes good. Period. Compared to many other brands I've had, this actually does taste nice. Very, very slightly 'sweet' taste, with no hint of the iodiney/plasticky taste you normally get from bottled water. They did a good job here.<br /><br />+ : the 1.5 liter size means it's good to bring along on a sports trip or other adventure. I took mine with me when I went surfing and it provided plenty of hydration to counter the effects of hours of intense physical activity.<br /><br />- : these run about $2 / bottle -- perhaps not bad, really, given how much you get per bottle... but, it's also quite a bit of waste and a lot of bulk to be shipping from Amazon.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: I'm not sure about the pH thing -- there are a lot of health gimmicks out there. However, this water seems to be a fair value and does indeed have a nice 'neutral' flavor. Tastes a lot like it came straight out of the R-O filter vs. being cooped up inside a plastic bottle. If I saw this at the convenience store and I was thirsty, I'd consider buying it over some other popular brands.

review/text: This water tastes like distilled water with a pinch of baking soda.  I found it to have a slight aftertaste - mainly on the sides of my tongue.  I drank it before and during my work out and I did not notice any particular difference in hydration or thirst.  At a little over two bucks for a 1.5 liter bottle - delivered with prime - the price is not bad (if you are OK with the taste).  But I am a bit skeptical of the sweeping health claims.

review/summary: It tastes good...but......
review/text: Okay, I received the bottle of Essentia in the mail. I put it in the fridge to get it nice and cold and tried it out today.<br />Is it good water? Sure. It had a good clean taste, but the question that bothered me was "How much is this water per bottle?"<br />and "Is this something I would seek out at the store?"<br /><br />I"m not sure about either answer. Yes, it was good water, but was it that much better than any bottled water I buy at the store?<br />I don't know if it was any better and to have a 9.5 pH sounds great, but does it really mean that much to my health if I drink<br />this water versus other waters on the market?<br /><br />I will give it four stars. It was fresh tasting water and maybe it has other health benefits beyond just being water (as they<br />claim in their advertising), but how do I really know this to be true? I'll let you decide.

review/summary: Tastes great, comparable to Aquafina, but is it better for you?
review/text: I have medical issues and I need to drink a lot of water every day.  I know that many people can't tell that much of a difference between the various bottled waters, but I can.  My favorite water by far has been Aquafina and it just tastes fresher and sweeter to me.<br /><br />When I first started doing research on the difference between alkaline foods and acidic, and the differences between water that's been ionized and brands that haven't such as Aquafina, I found myself pretty confused. It seems that alkaline foods are just better for you and for my medical concerns (autoimmune problems and GERD and ischemic issues), but there appears to be a lot of disagreement as to what foods fit into what category. It can make you a little crazy trying to deal with all the disagreement from reputable sites.<br /><br />So I thought I'd give this water a try, since it's advertised as being better for you and not as acidic with a high PH level. Well I'm here to tell you that the water tastes very good (which is so important to me), but that I am just not sure I believe the claims that it's better for you. A very close friend was a dean of chemistry at our nearby state university and he told me not to believe the claims about these so-called "healthy waters" and that It just doesn't make a difference. He told me the same thing about claims that water is oxygenated - it doesn't pass scientific muster.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you it makes a difference or doesn't because I just don't know. But if you want a good tasting water I would recommend this.

review/summary: Smooth, refreshing water. Does it live up to what it says? Yes. Is it going to improve your health? Yet to find out
review/text: Essentia delivers refreshing water with the ideal ph level of 9.5, along with electrolytes and minerals.<br /><br />I immediately felt a difference with this water. It was thin, pure, and tasted very clean. It did not have the bland, over-filtered taste of Aquafina nor Dasani. We need to have minerals and the natural tastes in our water.<br /><br />If you are looking for high quality water (who would've thought of such a thing existed), Essentia is it. It is a bit pricey for water though. However, for twelve 1.5 liter bottles in the $25 - $30 range, it seems priced as if you were buying soda or juice. If you want an alternative to sugary beverages, Essentia may give you a good case for a premium water that is enjoyable to drink.

review/summary: Ph Balanced Water
review/text: There are a few things that I look for in a bottled drinking water.  One is oxygenation which a few bottled water companies put out.  Pente water is my favorite of this kind (and has stabilized medicinal grade oxygen).  Oxygen tends to alkalize.  Two is a Ph balanced water.  Essentia is my favorite one of these.  I find that I drink the whole bottle very quickly, because it satisfies a need.  The body likes the balance that it gives.  It helps rehydrate and for the body to remove toxins.  One of the curious ways that this shows up is that when I drink a ph balanced water, I tend to go to the bathroom very soon afterwards (and you can tell from the urine color and from how much the urine "bubbles" that it is removing toxins).  It seems to move through the body quicker.  When my father needed to alkalize, I had recommended that he take Pente water.  But he could not find it where he was and he stumbled on Essentia water and found it worked for him and got similar results to Pente water.  I got a bottle of the Essentia water from the Amazon review program partly because it had worked for my father.  I could taste the difference, taste the minerals that made it more alkaline.  It felt slightly thicker than regular water and slightly smoother.  I drank up the whole 1.5 liter bottle within less than an hour because it felt like it was satisfying a need inside me.  If I had to choose, I would probably still pick some Pente water over the Essentia water, because the oxygen still alkalizes and has other benefits from the oxygen itself.  But Essentia would be my second choice.  If I was stocking up, however, I would get both of them.  My guess is that there different approaches to alkalizing would make them complimentary.

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good!
review/text: Essentia tastes great. I am usually a Fiji fan, but Essentia takes the prize because of its 9.5 pH. There is no major difference that I can describe, however, there is a subtle difference. I don't know if it is just the alkylinity, but whatever the reason, I like it.<br /><br />They do sell machines that can create high pH water, but the decent ones start at $700! That makes Essentia a real bargain. Now, whether you buy into the health claims or not, well, that's a different story. Having been treated for Stage four cancer, I'm trying it, and will keep stocking it as long as I can find it. The idea that a more alkyline pH can help fight off cancer has been written up  many times, however, the validity of those claims are somewhat questionable, and until something appears in a peer reviewed medical journal (and is not funded by Essentia) it remains a matter of opinion. I will update if I find more information. As far as staying hydrated better, I don't know, and without blood tests I don't think I could tell....but like I said, it tastes good.

I appreciate the fact that the container itself is BPA and Phthalate-free and I don't have to worry about those chemicals leaching into my water after long periods of storage.  At the least, I can store my spring water in the Essentia empty bottles.

review/text: Alright so this is a pretty lame review, I'll admit, but I can't find a lot to say about Essentia Drinking Water. It doesn't taste bad so that's something. It doesn't really taste like anything that I could pick up. Water is water. I'm sure if you did a blind taste test between Essentia and a couple other brands of bottled water there might be some difference but as is it is pretty...watery? So don't buy it for its taste but at the same time don't NOT buy it for its taste.<br /><br />If you're purchasing Essentia is is probably for the "health benefits." So if that is something important to you (not a real concern to me) then you might want to consider purchasing this but do your research first. Apparently health claims are unverified.<br /><br />I can't really imagine a reason for spending $30 for bottled water but hey, different strokes for different folks.

review/summary: taste a bit alkaline
review/text: The product description for this water emphasizes that it has a pH of 9.5 (compared to around 7.4 for normal water) and that this somehow cures every disease known to man and drastically improves your health. First of all, I'm always suspicious of a food or beverage company making over-the-top claims about the health benefits of its product without rigorous scientific evidence. Unfortunately, too many people are gullible these days and will buy anything that promises better health.<br /><br />I don't have the medical expertise to really evaluate these claims. What I do know is that the water does taste a bit more alkaline than regular spring water. The company is at least right in that regard - you can taste the difference. Unfortunately, I'm personally not crazy about the taste - it doesn't taste as fresh. I'd recommend tasting it first and seeing whether you like the taste, rather than investing this for its supposed medicinal value.

review/text: From a health & wellness perspective, I defer to the other reviews which are quite thorough and complete.

This is not one I would suggest for that purpose.  Served cold, the taste is clean, crisp and refreshing. If the water isn't quite chilled the taste may edge toward "left on the night stand over night and degassed..."

review/summary: Tastes like water.  Very good water.
review/text: I was really concerned that this water would have a weird or salty taste to it, but nope.  It tastes just like water... probably closer to Dasani than to Poland Spring, and nothing like Evian (not surprising, since the label indicates they use reverse osmosis to do the purification, which is what Dasani does).<br /><br />Most surprisingly, there really is something to the "silky smooth taste," it's not purely marketing.  Whether from the high pH or something else, this is just good water.  (That said, I don't necessarily feel better hydrated than I would with regular water.)<br /><br />Regarding the health claims of alkali water, YMMV.  To their credit, Essentia doesn't really make any of the claims on the bottle, but Google them or look them up on other products here on Amazon.  Some people are hard core believers, some think they're bunk.  I am not really qualified to give a real scientific judgement on them, but I started looking into alkaline water after reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470913029">The Paleo Diet: Lose Weight and Get Healthy by Eating the Foods You Were Designed to Eat</a>.  There's an interesting rant in the book about the acid/base balance in the body (in short, the contention is that lots of grains lead to the body being to acidic and an acidic body is bad).  The suggestion there is basically to eat lots of vegetables, but my immediate thought was "why not just drink alkaline water?"  I have no idea of the answer.<br /><br />If you're curious, the plastic bottle is a PETE 1.  Also, these are 1.5 Litre bottles, which are quite big.

review/text: This is a highly alkaline water of 9.5 pH.<br /><br />The body is a chemical soup made up of both acid and alkaline substances.  Blood in the body is kept at a pH of between 7.35 and 7.45.  Most of the things we eat and drink are acidic, in addition to a certain acidity of the air we breath.  Therefore, proponents of drinking alkaline water say it helps neutralize the acidity of the body by drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />According to the Mayo Clinic, "Some studies suggests that alkaline water may help slow bone loss, but further investigation is needed to determine if this influences overall bone mineral density and if the benefit is maintained over the long term."  No other studies that I could find have been done to test the health benefits of drinking alkaline water.<br /><br />We can now buy bottled water that is specifically alkaline, such as this highly alkaline<br />Essentia bottled water.  It has a clean taste and is delicious.  I mix it was a little<br />xylitol <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003CNOUWQ">Health Garden Kosher Birch Xylitol 1 Lbs. Product of USA (Not From Corn)</a> and use it as a mouth rinse morning and evening to neutralize the acids in my mouth<br />from food.  The xylitol helps harden the tooth enamel.<br /><br />This water is very pure tasting and refreshing.  It is soft tasting.  It is perfect if you get frequent acid indigestion.  This also is a good way to finish a meal.  The alkalinity will neutralize the acidity of the food you just ate, therefore making it soothing to your upper digestive tract including the esophagus and the stomach.<br /><br />I will keep buying this delicious bottled water and add it to my current variety of bottled waters I keep in the fridge.  I also drink Fiji, a very pure water from an underground spring in Fiji, Smart Water which is similar to this in that it also is purified tap water, and San Pelligrino, the most mineral laden spring water you can buy as far as I can tell, but also very refreshing.<br /><br />This particular water goes well with a meal and helps sooth the digestive tract.

review/summary: Muscle spasms
review/text: My wife has recurring extreme muscle spasms, usually late at night or early morning.  We started to use this water for her about 6 months ago.  It has been the best purchase we have ever made [I am not kidding].  I haven't noticed anyone mentioning this benefit, but I can assure you it works!!  We ran out a couple of days ago and had to wait and do without for about 3 days.  She had awful muscle spasms in both legs last night.  Back to where she was before we starting using this water.  We were really thankful that we received 3 cases this morning.  I have vowed "as god is my witness I will never run out of Essentia water again" {from the movie Gone with the wind, ha ha]. But for real, we are now ordering 4 case per month so that we will never run out again.

review/summary: The only bottled still water I drink...
review/text: Some people debate about the high PH - one can Google to find the issues and discussion. I used to drink Trinity water but they went out of business. I found Essentia and found I like it better.<br /><br />I only drink bottled water -- Essentia is expensive so I use other spring water for making coffee and cooking. But I drink a minimum of four 8 oz glasses a day -- often six. (The recommendation of 8 glasses of water per day has now been found to be excessive. Four to six will do -- but it definitely makes a difference doing so -- my skin becomes smoother and clear within days, it helps when I work out.<br /><br />I now get it through Amazon through subscribe and save -- it is cheaper than in the stores (even in Whole Foods with a 10% case discount) and it is too much of a hassle to ensure the stores have it -- as they are quite inconsistent with their water ordering.<br /><br />The taste I find delicious and superb. My partner prefers Glaceaus' smart water. He drinks it at room temperature and it has a lower but still substantial Ph.<br /><br />In researching for this review I have learned about two other waters with high Ph's: Kagen and Qure. There are differences among all three and I haven't had the time to nail down the differences and which would be deemed more healthy. I probably will do that sometime in the future.<br /><br />But you can't go wrong with Essentia. Try some (chilled in the fridge) and see if you like it. Your body certainly will.

review/summary: Big bottle, slightly above average taste
review/text: 50.7 ounces for a bottle.<br />Ingredients: purified water, sodium bicarbonate, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate and calcium chloride.<br /><br />"Best available pH at 9.5"?<br /><br />The bottle also boats a "silky smooth taste". I did notice that...but just a bit. I would recommend this to people who are not trustful of their local water sources, like some of my step-relatives in Indiana. A 12 pack of this would come in handy. Otherwise, you're likely just fine and dandy with your usual purifier.

review/summary: Great tasting
review/text: I think the Essentia drinking water tastes very good.  There are a couple popular brands of bottled water that I think taste funny.  The Essentia is very good and "crisp".  I can't say much about the actual pH level, because I did not test it.  However, I didn't seem to have as many issues with my acid relux on the days when I drank the Essentia.  It's awkward carrying the 1.5 liter bottle around, but I did actually find it helpful.  I take it to work in the morning and make myself drink it until it's gone before I allow myself to have something "good" (meaning - bad for me).  Therefore, I do get a  much larger water intake during the day at the office than I normally would.  So, I love the taste and the size of the bottle, but it can get expensive.  I will probably keep some on hand, especially when my acid reflux is really acting up and the prilosec isn't helping, but I'm not sure if I could really afford to buy it to have every single day.

review/summary: Clean taste
review/text: When I drank from the first bottle, I wasn't really impressed, and thought it must have been hype. However, a few days later I drank some more and it seemed better.  It's refreshing, has no taste whatsoever, and is smooth.  Of course it is water, but it doesn't have that plastic taste some get from the plastic bottles.  I can't say anything as to its health claims, but it is good, and I would purchase in the future.

review/summary: Darn Good Water
review/text: Okay, I can't really speak to Essentia's claims regarding its 9.5pH balanced water. I just know that it's refreshing and tastes (if water has a taste) pure and satisfying. No off flavors or odors. I know that it has some additives to bring the pH to 9.5, but I can't detect them. One of these large 1.5 liter bottles lasts me all day.<br /><br />If Essentia's claims are accurate and it does help with things like maintaining normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and boosting the antioxidant properties of your immune system, then so much the better. It does seem to hydrate well and absorb into my system faster than regular filtered or spring water. I also get occasional heartburn after certain meals and find that its more basic pH helps alleviate such symptoms without me having to take antacids.<br /><br />Essentia does cost a bit more so I will reserve getting it for when I find it on sale or can get a bulk discount. Aside from the price, I have to say it is my new favorite 'brand' of water. I like the taste and find it thirst quenching. Any added health benefits are a bonus.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Try It, It May Help . . .
review/text: I received my case of Essentia bottled water just in time to try out while I experienced a sore throat and upper respiratory congestion.  Usually, I battle one of these complete with headache and cough from start to finish for around two weeks at least once every winter season.  However, this particular virus didn't hold on for that long--after day three, I was already feeling better and able to function at 98%.<br /><br />I have no idea of knowing just exactly what aided me so quickly in this battle.  I've been experimenting with<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJDNM4">Rainbow Light Counter Attack, 90-Count</a>--taking 1-3 of these a day during the whole period of Eastern Standard Time.  I've upped my Vitamin C intake with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CD9XGC">Lypo-Spheric Vitamin C, Box of 30 packets</a>--and slugged down the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETASU">Nature's Way Sambucus Syrup, 4-Ounce</a>--yes, I do not like to be slowed down by cold or flu--the headaches I experience are debilitating in the extreme.  During the cold's initial three-day siege on my body, I also upped my water intake with hope that I would be helping my body expel move the healing process along faster.<br /><br />Needless to say, the case of water came in really handy, as I was not in any shape to drive a vehicle to even run the most essential errands.  I actually heated Essentia to make tea--I have no idea whether or not this effects any of the alkaline properties???--if anyone understands this better than I please feel free to offer exposition.  The outcome was a good one--I shook the cold in around 5 complete days, the last two of which I was well on my way to feeling fully functional--without over-the-counter decongestants and cough syrups.<br /><br />I had originally agreed to try the Essentia in order to test it with my running--I am always looking for something that will help me recuperate faster after a good run.  Unfortunately I was not able to do this as the virus took hold'<br /><br />When I can afford it, I purchase<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00061EXBU">Penta Water Purified, .5 LT Bottles (Pack of 24)</a>r--which actually does help athletes recuperate faster--but as this tends to get expensive--I was purchasing this from my personal trainer--I thought Essentia might prove to be a good substitute.  That part of my review is officially in a wait state; I promise to edit this once I try Essentia in relation to athletic performance.<br /><br />As far as taste goes, this water definitely tastes smoother.  Like Penta, it goes down a lot easier.  I do not experience acid reflex symptoms, so I cannot comment on the water's effectiveness with regard to this.  There is no comparison between the tap water here in the New Orleans area and Essentia water.  Essentia wins this taste war hands down.  Tap here has a nasty chlorine taste, which I simply do not like.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Essentia water seems to have been one weapon in an arsenal of wellbeing products that recently helped me remain healthy.  Supposedly, high-alkaline water aids in promoting wellness in the following way:<br />* Super hydrates your body<br />* Alkalizes your body<br />* Oxygenates your cells<br />* Detoxifies your body<br />* Protects you from Free Radical Damage<br />* Provides the foundation that enhances everything you are doing for optimum health.<br />Now while there may be no "proof" of these claims--think back in the history of medicine, where practitioners came up with treatments that had no solid backing until more knowledge was accumulated--perhaps, trying something as simple as this will help you feel better and live a better life.  In terms of price, this water is considerably less expensive than some of the other ionized waters out there. Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"

review/summary: Its good water
review/text: This water tastes very fresh and good, I guess because of the pH balancing in part.<br /><br />After drinking it for a while, that feeling wears off and it just feels like water.<br /><br />The label says they restructure the water... I'm not really sure water needs to be improved in this way.<br /><br />I think they would do better to further educate the customer as to why you would care that much about the pH.  And "hydrates better" is really a vague statement.  Better than what?  How much better?<br /><br />Anyway if you like trying different kinds of water (like my wife does) you will find that it does go down silky smooth.<br /><br />Overall I think its good, I just think that the benefits outlined are very sketchy, so I remove a star for that.

review/summary: Does it really help?
review/text: I am used to all types of water including tap water. If you weren't told otherwise, this water tastes 'normal'. However, if you tell someone that it is special water, then the person thinks that they can taste a slight difference. We'd need a blind taste test to figure that one out.<br /><br />This water though isn't about taste -- it is about the special properties of the water and what it can do for the drinker. For me I couldn't feel a major difference but I am not a power athlete nor do I think I have problems drinking other types of water. My mistake in reviewing this product is that I shared the water with my friends for their opinion instead of drinking it solid for a few days. Such a test may help me better understand if this water makes a true difference. It might be that the creators of this water intend for a person to drink this water over weeks/months to get the true benefits. If that is the case, this is just too expensive for me.

review/summary: It's Water...It Tastes Wet
review/text: Essentia 9.5 pH Drinking Water, 1.5 Liter, (Pack of 12)<br /><br />I cannot say that the claimed health benefits of this water are true. In order to prove or disprove that, I would have to hire a team of scientists and do expensive and exhaustive tests on myself. I'm not going to do that!<br /><br />What I can tell you is that I have well water and it is extremely high in iron and has to have a softener added to make the water palatable. My problem with that is that I'm on a low salt diet for a heart condition so I now have to double filter my drinking water. It's filtered once at the beginning of the well and again in a separate filter in my fridge.<br />This is some of the info from the Essentia web site, and the product description from here- "Drinking Essentia Water helps bring you back into balance and helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more. Plus, Essentia Water boosts the antioxidant properties of your immune system."<br /><br />I have to admit that I did drink a whole bottle of this for the last few days---and I have been sleeping better (Can't tell you if it's a coincidence). IF the claims of lowering blood pressure and heart health are true that will be a plus for me, but right now as I said only long-term usage and the help of my doctor will tell me if the claims are true.<br /><br />It tastes better than my well water and actually, it does have a `smooth' sort of taste to it. Of course, since it's bottled it is convenient to tote around and to keep some in my car too.<br /><br />The problem is, is that I'm not so sure if it is worth $2.40 a bottle without the subscription with the subscription it comes to $2.04 a bottle. If you drink the amount of water Doctors recommend, that will come to approximately 300.00 a month (much more if you want to use this water to make your coffee tea etc. for added health benefits ). In addition, having to haul a heavy case of water up the stairs a few times a month does not turn me on.

review/summary: It's marketed water that is not at an ideal pH for the body
review/text: This water purportedly contains 9.5 ph. However, the purported benefits of high pH water are not demonstrated in scientific literature, only in this company's marketing materials. The fact is that the ideal pH level of drinking water should be between 6-8.5. The body maintains a pH equilibrium on a constant basis that is not affected by water consumption of higher or lower pH, unless it's consistent consumption on a regular basis. In fact, our stomachs have a naturally low pH level of about 2, which is helpful for food digestion, and our stomachs will self-adjust to maintain this naturally low pH level.<br /><br />Yes, it's water, and Amazon will ship 12 bottles to you for about 2 bucks a bottle. If you do choose to get this monster shipment, also consider purchasing carbon off-sets.

review/summary: Great water, but bogus marketing claims
review/text: Essentia water tastes great, and its price is in the same ball park as other good quality bottled water. However, stating that the 9.5 pH is good for you is completely devoid of any scientific substance. In fact, there are a lot of scientific studies that completely refute these claims. There's a page by a retired chemistry professor, who rips into the variety of similar "alkalanized" and "ionized" water marketing claims. Most importantly, his page contains a lot of links to University and other scientific research results that all undermine the important of the 9.5 pH. Having said all that, I do like the taste of Essentia water, so whatever minerals it has in it does make for great tasting, pleasant to drink water. Just don't fall for the pH hype until and unless you read the science reports instead of trusting any marketing hype.<br />[...]

review/summary: Essentia: Improved Taste, Improved Digestion
review/text: Essentia 9.5 PH Drinking water is a bottled water made with good digestive health in mind. It takes the ordinary concept of bottled water a few steps further by adding calcium chloride, dipotassium phosphate, magnesium sulphate, and sodium bicarbonate. It then elevates the PH for better digestion and the reverse osmosis and purification via micro- filtration help make for the cleanest possible taste.<br /><br />We have all heard recommendations from experts that bottled water is a bunch of hype and not worth the money and for the most part I agree with this assessment. The majority of bottled waters on the market are nothing special and not worth the expenditure. But there are some bottled waters that are enhanced in ways that make them better and Essentia is one of them. The added minerals and improved processes help elevate this water to a level not matched by most bottled water products. The higher PH makes the product more alkaline and this suits someone like me very well, since I sometimes suffer from acid reflux. After a heavy meal, my stomach actually feels better if I drink this water.<br /><br />As for the taste, I find it very smooth and clean- the way water should taste. I have taste-tested this, side by side, against the water that comes out of my water filter pitcher and I can say that, while both taste good, this product is a little cleaner and smoother in flavor. It does cost more than the water out of my water filtered pitcher, but the taste is a little bit better.<br /><br />Essentia is packaged in BPA free plastic bottles and it is made with environmental concerns in mind. Combine that with the taste and improvements in digestion and you have a clear, bottled- water winner in my book.
