review/summary: Not too bad
review/text: When you are watching your carb and sugar intake, you soon discover that there aren't a lot of products available. I was happy when I came access this and was delightfully surprised by it. I know it isn't anywhere close to as good as the real thing. Pretty good taste once you get used to it. I recommend keeping it in the refrigerator.

review/summary: bitter, acrid, chemical taste
review/text: I couldn't believe how bad this tastes.  It doesn't even rate 1 star, but that appears to be the lowest rating possible.  I tried it with a couple different brands of ice cream, but it was always terrible.  The first impression is you wonder if someone tampered with it and put some kind of caustic chemical in the syrup.  Very, very bad taste. My bottle was labeled "BB 10 2011"

review/summary: Bitter yes, but so is real cocoa
review/text: If you've ever made hot cocoa from scratch using Hershey's powder, then this is bit what it tastes like. I guess the erythritol is not as sweet as real sugar, so this syrup has more of the bitter cocoa taste. If it's that bothersome than you probably need to add your own sweetener to the milk. It's probably not going to be great over icecream. As stated in another review erythritol is the most stomach friendly of all the sugar alcohols, so the plus side is you probably won't experience any gas or diarrhea from this.

review/text: This product has a bizarre chemical taste. If you let the glass sit in your sink for an hour, it gives off an unholy chemical, perfume odor, which cannot mean good things for what it's made of. This has got to be made from some inexpensive chemical filler that tastes like chocolate for 20, minutes then reverts to its revolting base.

review/text: I was really excited about getting this product. Well....when the syrup arrived I couldn't try it fast enough. Wow, was I disappointed. The after taste is awful!! The only time I've been able to use it I had to add something. As an example no sugar added vanilla ice cream, hershey's sf syrup and a bunch of fresh strawberries. You can still taste the after taste but at least it's tolerable that way. If you want chocolate milk or hot chocolate forget it. Look elsewhere!!

In an attempt to cut down on some of my caffine consumption I began trying different herbal tea's and fell in love with Rooibo's which I now drink everday instead of good old lipton's.<br />Pride of Africa is a combination of rooibo's and honeybush tea, it is not only good for you it's tastes wonderful hot or cold. My only complaint would be that it is a bit expensive for me so Davidson's Rooibo's will be my basic tea but this will be around too and always purchased if it goes on sale!

review/text: Creamy, with very very minimal "grainy" texture that tastes plain with tasteful if done right. What I do is cook this over a stove in a saucepot like in the instructions and when I serve it in a bowl I like to add 2 full bananas and mash and slice it in my bowl of this hot cereal and then I top it with a few pecans and its ready for my hungering appetite! It tastes soooo good with the sweetness and added texture of the banana and the crunch from the pecans. It taste nothing nasty that one often think of when its full of fiber. You can also prepare this in the microwave but beware the microwave instruction time. I did it on 8 minutes and it came out dried to the bowl. I would check every few minutes for consistency!

review/summary: My favorite oatmeal
review/text: This is a staple for us. Whole Foods carries it only intermittently, so finding it here on Amazon in a pack of six was great. It is not necessarily cheaper than it would be in the store, but at least they have it. The other grocery stores near us do not have it.<br /><br />We cook this by microwaving it. Even with only a two serving portion in the bowl, you will need a wide (3 inches at the base) and tall (five inches or taller) bowl to be able to microwave it without the oatmeal bubbling out over the bowl. That's my only complaint about this otherwise tasty, highly affordable, super-healthy food. I have to cook it in a huge bowl to keep the microwave clean.<br /><br />I add shaved almonds and raisins to this. Brown sugar is also very, very delicious with it.<br /><br />I live at 7,000 feet, by the way. If you are closer to sea level, maybe you won't have the bubbling over problem.

review/summary: Cereal
review/text: This cereal is the best of the bunch of grain cereals of those I've tried, so I buy a lot of it.  It's not at all unusual for me to eat this cereal three times a day, along with other nutritious food.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, I am not allowed to purchase as much as I wish so I have to make frequent smaller purchases.<br /><br />I almost always have it in the morning, limited only by running out of milk; although I occasionally eat it without milk.  I add a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon and water at a 3:1 (water:cereal) ratio, zap it on high for 90 seconds, let it sit for as long as it takes to finish my coffee while I read a few chapters from the Bible, and then finish with another 60 seconds to reach my preferred consistency and temperature.  To this I immediately add a very generous cup of walnuts and then cover with milk.  Pecans are better than walnuts when you can find good pecans, but that's a rarity here in North Carolina.  The very best pecans are grown in or near Hoover, Alabama by local folks and sold to local folks and not generally available elsewhere.  Eating a bowl of this cereal with a generous helping of Alabama pecans can make you feel like a very special and privileged person.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: The hot cereal is tasty and easy to prepare - I have only tried it with a bit of smart balance with olive oil, so far.  I like that it is organic and has flax and it will be awesome to use for baking.  I love the texture, but for some things I may grind it finer.  I got the 4 grain + flax because I can always add soy, corn, millet, etc.. for a change of pace. The quality is excellent and the price was right - a little over $3 a box or .13 cents an ounce!  The serving size is 1/4 cup dry, cooked with 3/4 cup water and it is a good size portion, I was really surprised.  Some of the other multigrain hot cereals have serving sizes of 1/2 cup dry with similar calories, etc... as the Arrowhead Mills, so they are really a lot more expensive per serving, even though they are close to this in price per ounce.  I am on a fixed income, so I compare a lot to get the lowest prices.  I do wish it had a bag with a zip or something on the inside, but will reuse an oatmeal cannister or something. :) It arrived a day earlier than expected, which was a pleasant surprise.

review/summary: Expired and too grainy!
review/text: I did not realize that the items sold under the guise of "Managers Specials" are special because they are almost expired!  I bought the 6 pack and it was due to expire within a month...not ok.  I tried one bowl before donating the rest to a food pantry, my opinion:<br /><br />1. It takes too long too cook, I don't want to invest that much time towards cooking a bowl of porriage.<br />2.  It has a lot going on...grain wise, I think just about every kind of grain on earth is mixed in.  Which I guess is ok, if your into that type of thing.<br />3.  The taste just isn't worth the effort (it doesn't have any taste, you could be chewing on anything grainy and textured) and it would also be beneficial if the would make individual packages for easy portion servings otherwise I can't imagine why someone would make an entire pot full of this stuff??<br /><br /> I typically like whole grain, low sugar type hot cereal but this is a little too earthy for me, however, clearly some people enjoy this type of thing but it is not for everyone.

review/summary: Less Flavorful than Traditional Starburst
review/text: These candies are rather bland when compared to traditional Starburst flavors. The package comes with two "morphing" flavors that are supposed to be cherry to cherry lime and orange to orange strawberry. They have the same plastic-like base texture, but there are tiny crunchy "flavor changing beads." I only bit directly down on two, which was enough to really release the flavor. They did not have a fruit smell either, it was similar to play-doh. Out of the entire package, one changed from orange to orange-with-something-funky and one did change from bland cherry to something close to lime zest. I didn't think they were worth the calories (220) to eat one individual package. Unfortunately, I will not be purchasing or eating this flavor again.

And yes, the flavor DOES change (morphs) half-way through the chewing.  Very, very YUMMY!!!!<br /><br />I wish that Starburst would add even more flavors, since the Morph only has orange and strawberry.  Why not make a grape-morphing-to-raspberry candy, or a green-apple-morphing-to-cherry selection?  Or a sweet-and-sour morph?  The sky's the limit!

Highly recommend with chocolate ice-cream.  now if only their was a non-fat, no sugar, guilt-free version.

review/text: These are absolutely scrumptious.  I don't know what else I can say about them.  They melt in your mouth, the mint is strong and perfectly blended with the chocolate.  These are some of the best chocolate mint cookies I have ever eaten.  I am tempted to buy them again and pass them off to my friends as homemade!

review/summary: Excellent desserts, Great tasting, and healthier than thin mints
review/text: I found these at my local store and could not believe how great they taste. They are all-natural and taste amazing. They taste comparable and possibly better than Girl Scout Thin Mints, and they don't have the artificial flavor or hydrogenated oil that is in Thin Mints. And plus these cookies contain MonoSat Fats.  Although these cookies do have 2 more grams of sugar and just slightly more sodium.  These cookies do not crumble easily like you would expect. These have a nice crunch to them. And the chocolate and mint are not overbearing either.  Highly recommended.  I'll never buy Girl Scout Cookies again. Back to Nature makes some amazing cookies.

review/summary: delicious if you don't mind being thirsty all day (160mg sodium/serving)
review/text: these cookies, while admittedly are delicious though I agree with another reviewer that said they are more mint than chocolate, leave me strangely thirsty. the kind of thirst that is annoyingly uncomfortable. Even after only eating a single cookie, 15 minutes later I was so thirsty it was uncomfortable. I discovered they have 160 mg sodium per serving (4 cookies in a serving according to the label). Compare that to a health valley organic chocolate chip granola bar at 15mg of sodium per bar, a whole foods brand 365 organic swiss dark chocolate with mint crisps chocolate bar at 0 mg sodium, 365 brand frosted morning O's with 50mg of sodium, and you can easily see how salty these are. Newman O's mint creme flavor have 2 cookies in a serving (which is actually like 4 cookies with a creme center like an oreo, with only 70mg sodium per serving, less than half. The point is, the sodium isn't just bad if you are on a low sodium diet, but they are bad because they make you very thirsty... uncomfortably thirsty! Too bad, because they are delicious. I won't be buying another box with too many other mint chocolate products on the market that are healthier and don't leave me uncomfortable a few minutes later like eating at a restaurant whose food is delicious on the plate but get home and experience stomach pains, acid reflux, or other discomfort. I have learned that there are many restaurants with delicious food and no discomfort after and the food digests well. Food is more than the moment. It has to also nourish and not make you sick later... These don't make the cut. And its not that I'm weird. I'm a normal 30-something guy with a healthy apetite and discerning palette. Buyer beware.

review/summary: Good if Possibly Adulterated Basic Bison Patties
review/text: The seller shipped very quickly and with secure packaging, such that the product all arrived frozen solid. Shipping obviously was a little high, especially for those of us used to having the Amazon Prime shipping deal; but it was reasonable compared to other sellers I had looked into.<br /><br />The actual product packaging is also well thought out. Each rectangular box (which stacks well in the freezer and conserves space) contains two vacuum-packed plastic bundles, each of which contains three bison patties, separated by butcher's paper. The outer boxes are sturdy enough to support and stack well without getting limp from moisture etc., and the inner plastic wrappings appear secure and so far haven't leaked (a problem I've had with many meat products in the past few years).<br /><br />Being someone who has consumed a lot of bison, I was a little dubious upon seeing these patties described as "80/20", which generally means 80% meat and 20% fat. My concern there was because bison has virtually no fat; my understanding is that one cannot really even find enough fat on the animal to add it to the ground meat to up the fat percentage for burgers. So I suspected (and this may be true) that this product has some beef fat added to it. The patties also hold together well (unusual for ground bison) and they don't have quite the normal dark red color, either.<br /><br />Still, upon cooking the patties, they appear to be pure bison texture-wise, and they taste like pure bison, if a little fattier than normal. They did release a fair amount of liquid (again abnormal for ground bison), so I do think something "extra" has been added. However, this is probably due to the fact that people expect "burgers" to have a certain cohesiveness and slightly fatty taste, and regular ground bison is actually difficult to form into a burger due to its leanness. Anyway - I wasn't overly concerned by the end about these issues, although I think such things should be clarified in the packaging information as well as on any websites where the product is being sold. I have encountered "100% pure bison" labels on products that had at least 10% beef added. I've even encountered claims stating that the "law" required them to add beef (which is nonsense). Anyway; could be I'm mistaken and these really are 100% bison; but in the end, after cooking, it appears that is what you are eating, even if beef fat was added.<br /><br />The burgers shrank a bit in cooking, but that's normal for burgers; they remained a good size and I have enjoyed them. I would probably buy them again, even though I am still a little unsure about the mix issue.

review/text: This is the easy way to swallow a teaspoon of cinnamon in 30 seconds or less!  Just use this Cinnamon Matcha instead, and whisk it in hot water.  You'll be gulping it up at record speed!  It is so yummy!<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know, that's not the idea behind the cinnamon challenge.  But, I assure you - this is much easier to swallow in 30 seconds, and better for you too.  (Yes, cinnamon is good for you, but it is very questionable, indeed, whether or not its healthy for you to swallow a teaspoon of dry, ground cinnamon.)<br /><br />This is really delicious.  The cinnamon is a spicy-sweet kind of cinnamon, reminiscent of Saigon cinnamon.  Very zesty - it enlivens the palate with its warm, exotic spice.  It makes a really nice combination with the sweet, buttery, vegetal notes of the Matcha.

review/text: I'm a sucker for cinnamon, so of course I had to try the Cinnamon Matcha. It smells so good. Sooooo good. Not like fake cinnamon hearts (which I adore too), but like real cinnamon. I want to slather this matcha on toast...but that would be weird. This is another matcha that inspires me to bake. Matcha snickerdoodles? Don't mind if I do! I need to start actually trying some of these recipe ideas. Like cinnamon matcha cinnamon toast! Or a cinnamon matcha apple pie! Nom nom nom.<br /><br />At first sip, it was delicious. At second sip, it was delicious. At third sip...well, you get the idea. There is something I don't care for about it, a bit of a tangy aftertaste, but that's not enough to keep me from drinking it! I'm excited to see how it will taste when blended with the vanilla. Ooooh, I should see if they have an apple matcha, that would be yummy mixed with this. Or pear! Oh dear, my list of desired matchas is growing longer and longer...<br /><br />But really, I just want to dump a whole mess of sugar into this and make some cinnamon raisin toast. And bake my little heart out! I think this is a matcha I will end up mixing more than making straight, but that's okay. I am seeing a wide world of possibilities coming from this little beauty. Cinnamon and I were good friends before, but I think is safe to say that this tea has pushed us over the edge into best friend territory. Plays well with others, makes me feel better, and encourages me to eat tasty, tasty sweets! I can see this becoming a staple in my cupboard, sitting right next to my beloved vanilla.

Also, the caviar comes in a can like that of tuna fish or sardines. (Wish I would've known that before placing the order).<br /><br />The worst part of all is the mushy, bad-tasting mess that's inside...probably the result of its ingredients: salmon roe, salt, vegetable oil, sorbic acid.<br /><br />I am NOT happy with my order and feel I just threw money in the garbage.  The *reality* of the product bears *no resemblance* to the photo posted on Amazon.<br /><br />I have three cans of this stuff and don't know what to do with them.

review/summary: The Only Formula that Worked
review/text: I think switching formulas is becoming a popular past-time of new parents these days, and when I look back on our experience with our first baby I'm almost ashamed at how frantically we switched her formulas around, searching for an answer to her gassy, colicky behavior. I think in total we tried 7 or 8, from powder to ready-to-feed, hoping that one would be a magical formula that eased her tummy (and our eardrums) during her fussy evening hours.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of those formulas worked magic. It ended up being that our daughter's belly really did just need to grow & mature before she could readily digest formula, and even the hypo-allergenic ones made little difference in her spit-up or tummy achin' behavior.<br /><br />However, Similac Sensitive was always our fall-back formula because it seemed to cause the least amount of stomach upset, didn't smell as horrible as some of the others, and with the coupons they send out (from StrongMoms) - it was surprisingly affordable for the most part. Strangely, our daughter would only drink ready-to-feed and would never finish a powder-prepared bottle and did seem more gassy after those. So we had to bite our bottom lips and put out the extra money for the liquid, which though expensive, was also very handy on trips and during late night feedings.<br /><br />Similac Sensitive still has a small amount of lactose in it, but it's broken down more than Similac Advance so it's easier to digest. And since it's already sterilized in the bottle, there are none of those new-parent worries over your powdered formula being contaminated or washing your hands before every bottle you make/feed. Trust me, when you're running on 2 hours of sleep, these "simple pleasures" can really make a big difference. I also called Similac's customer service on several occasions to ask questions and they were polite and helpful, and even sent coupons!<br /><br />We used Similac Sensitive until our daughter was ready to transition to cow's milk, and although we tried cheaper versions and many other formulas in an attempt to save money, we could never find anything our baby would take as easily as Similac Sensitive, so we stuck by it and would do so with the next baby should the need arise.<br /><br />**********UPDATE**********<br />We just had our second child and immediately skipped all other formulas and went straight to Similac Sensitive. This has saved so much trouble from the first time around! Baby #2 is doing great on this formula, however, he has been diagnosed with Acid Reflux. This means feedings are very difficult and painful. The only alternative to try from this formula is Nutramigen, but its too expensive. We are giving baby #2 Zantac prescribed from his pediatrictian and it seems to be helping.<br /><br />It wasn't mentioned before, but if your baby is taking Similac Sensitive, but still having a lot of spit up or acts differently on the powder vs RTF. This is probably because the RTF is much thicker and babies are able to handle it better. The RTF is also much easier to digest than the powdered version because the nutrients have been fully dissolved 100% into liquid. However, with the powder, baby's belly may have to work a little harder to process the powder. Because our children have acid reflux, powder is not an option. The less spit up, the better because stomach acid is brought back up into the esophagus the more they spit up.

review/summary: Best formula for my baby
review/text: I know a lot of people come on here and complain it has corn syrup. However, I have tried about 20 formulas and this was the only one that worked for my baby. When you find ones that works, you stick to it. The fact that she is getting nutrients from it and it stays down, that is what I am focused on as a mother. Other formulas made her gag and throw up. Just because she did not like them I am not going to go to the other formula pages and put them down.<br /><br />I have been buying this formula for over a year here. I just received an email that they no longer are doing the Subscribe and Save price. That is sad. The regular price of the item now is higher than my local Walmart store. It was so convenient to order from Amazon and have it delivered to my door. Plus, I would rather give my money to Amazon but as a single mother, I need to get the cheaper price.<br /><br />I hope they decide to add it back to subscribe and save again if enough people write about it. It was so much easier. I guess this will be my last purchase until they either lower the price or add it back to S&S.

review/summary: Love the Formula. Amazon delivery unpredictable.
review/text: We normally use the powder formula but this is not that much more money and it is easier to use. The formula seems thicker than powder formula and if its anything like the difference between powdered milk and real milk it probably tastes better too. Our baby is almost 6 months old and a thicker milk is probably a good ramp up to more solid foods. We like sensitive because it is gentler on the stomach than regular formula so for the price this is a good buy.<br /><br />Only thing that has been spotty is the shipping, generally the package comes very quick, usually in 3 days from order but sometimes longer. The packaging has been strange also, the first order came in a big plastic bag with no padding. The box was breaking open and 2 bottles had dents on them. The formula seemed ok but was a strange package indeed. The second came in a regular box over another box and was much better padded. I am glad they are packaging better because I almost stopped ordering this from Amazon for that reason. At this point all is good.

review/summary: Definitely helped with gas! Much better than powdered version!
review/text: Our daughter showed signs of colic in the first two weeks, so we immediately switched from Similac Advance to the Similac Sensitive.  Before she was born, I had purchased a large case of the 2oz ready-to-feed bottles (one of Advance, one of Sensitive) just in case. We had nearly used all of the Advance by the time she started having problems, so I switched her to the Sensitive. It definitely helped. I still had to supplement her with gripe water (we used Colic Calm - my goodness, that product is WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY, if you have a colic child PLEASE don't waste any time, pick up the Colic Calm at your local CVS or order it online through their website, it saved us).<br /><br />Here's the catch - after a while, I tried to switch her to the powdered version of the Similac Sensitive.  I will be honest here and say that the powdered version ends up thinner, causing more spit up and hiccups.  You also have to be careful when mixing it.  If you shake it up, it becomes very bubbly with air and causes tremendous amounts of gas. For us, it was as if she had gone back to her colicky ways again.  I knew it had to be the powder, so I put her right back on the liquid ready-to-feed and she is amazing again.  Sleeping 6+ hours at night, no fussiness, etc. I hope this helps someone - good luck parents!

review/summary: Good for a LACTOSE FREE formula
review/text: Our second daughter was having severe gas cramps, she would cry when she ate and would struggle to pass gas. We decided to try a lactose free formula (we were on Good Start initially, which my first daughter did wonderfully on). So far, it's been a week, it has worked to eliminate 99% of her gas. She still has an occassional bout here and there but she's 3 months old and that's to be expected. She has the occasional green bowel movement, which is perfectly normal for a formula supplemented with iron.<br /><br />Regarding the sugar content. I'm not crazy about the sugar but having looked around, every lactose free formula I've seen has some type of sugar as a starting ingredient. I spoke with both Similac and Enfamil and they use sugar because they need to add a carb to replace the removed lactose (which was the sugar stripped from the formula). Babies need loads of carbs so they need to replace the sugar with something to keep the formula balanced.<br /><br />Things I like about this formula"<br />- Similac's 32oz liquid containers and powder containers are completely BPA free (confirmed this on the phone recently), no other major formula maker can claim that<br />- Easy to find this formula because of Similac's popularity in all forms; RTF, concentrated and powder<br />- It's working to decrease my child's gas, which was obviously due to lactose<br /><br />Things I don't like about this formula:<br />- Sugar content, though I don't think there's anything anyone can do about that... choose higher sugar or a screaming kid<br />- The ready to feed is a little foamy but that's resolved with a couple drops of Mylicon in the bottle<br /><br />I'm keeping my child on this formula for a couple months until her digestive system matures then we'll try a "regular" formula again. I would recommend this formula for a child struggling with lactose, either due to immature digestion or a lactose intolerance.

review/summary: Good for lactose intolerent babies
review/text: My baby was very gassy and acidic when she was born,and still is. Iam lactose intolerant so I Figured she may be and tried many baby formulas including soy based. None of them helped until I Found the similac milk based lactose free formula(similac sensitive)My baby was so much more happy and her symptoms are gone. I have even switched back to other formulas to make sure and she always gets sick . My baby is only allowed to drink this formula are the lactaid milk that I drink.She is now one years old and wants no other type of milk. This is a very helpful formula.

review/summary: Formula is wonderful...Amazon Price RAISES - Not so much...
review/text: The formula is wonderful - I haven't had a single problem since I started using it when my baby was 3 months old.  He's now 9mths and is still doing great on this stuff...I'm just glad he's almost near the end of his formula days since it's the price (specifically the Amazon price) I'm not happy with.<br /><br />I've been buying this formula from Amazon since March 2012 - and at that time it was the best price out there - $36.70 for a 6pk ($6.12/bottle).<br /><br />Then by August the price had jumped to $38.16 ($6.36/bottle) - but still the cheapest price out there, so I wasn't complaining.<br /><br />Now - October - the price has jumped yet again to $41.94 ($6.99/bottle)  - making it more expensive than Walmart or Target.<br /><br />The seller has always been Amazon (not another seller through Amazon) - so it's not a change in seller causing the price changes.  I just hope the price raises were out of necessity...and I guess I'll have to take my $180 a month elsewhere from now on.

review/text: I don't get why it is soooo expensive here on Amazon. I see a third party is the seller, but still! I can get the box of 6 elsewhere for $35, which is what it seems all the other Similac RTF 6 packs sell for here on Amazon.<br /><br />But anyways...regardless of price, my son has done so well on this formula. On the regular Similac, he was gassy and spitting up way too much. But the Sensitive has done wonders.

review/summary: great formula
review/text: I love this formula. Our son has always been very gassy and at first I tried removing dairy + acidic food from my diet (for up to 8 weeks) but it didn't seem to help much. So we decided to supplement the breast milk with the enfamil gentlease: it did help some but still gassy and sleepying poorly which reflected in a very fussy baby during the day. 3 days ago we switched to the similac sensitive and for the past 3 nigths he slept consistently for 6 hours, then I would nurse him (we don't want to give up fully with the breast milk, there are too many good reasons to keep it in at least partially) and he would sleep for another 4-5 hours! he also seems to be napping better during the day and to be much less fussy and gassy overall. I'm really glad we tried the similac sensitive, I wouldn't have do it if I didn't read a few very convincing reviews. Also love the fact that it is ready to go, just need to warm it up but no water needed: makes it great for traveling without worries. If your baby is gassy I would definitely recommend giving this formula a try, it may or may not work for you depending on your baby's GI tract sensitivity, it totally made the trick for us!

review/summary: Best Formula! Our Pumpkin loves it
review/text: Similac Sensitive for fussy and gassy babies is amazing. Our pumpkin loves it! I was afraid to try formula because our baby is breastfeed and had trouble with gassiness from milk products I ate or drank. This was the perfect solution if you are going to try formula for the first time. We haven't had any problems for 3 weeks now. No fussiness, no gassiness, no spit up:o) You hear all the horror stories about formula and how it affects our babies...well this one has been great! We still breastfeed but supplement with formula. Also, make sure when you go to buy this formula you look for Fussy and Gassy...Similac makes another sensitive formula to reduce spit up. This one has an Orange lable and the other one is more of a pinkish orange...like salmon:o)Here's to Happy Eating!

review/summary: The best formula for my baby!
review/text: I have stricly formula fed my daughter since day one. We started out with Similac Advance in the hospital and did great with that for the first 5 weeks. My daughter started getting really fussy during feedings and having trouble with painful gas and some spit up. Similac had sent us a nice package which included a sample of the sensitive powder so we thought we would give it a try. We noticed a difference immedietly. What we also noticed was how foamy the powder was compared to the advance. We tried the powder for about 10 days and noticed our baby seemed to be getting uncomfortable again when using the powder. I had purchased some of the 8oz ready to feeds and had used them a few times and she seemed to digest it better. My daughter is used to drinking formula at room temperature, so yes, it is a bit of a pain now since this has to be refridgerated but if she is happy, I am happy and will continue to feed her this. Even though the price isn't competive on amazon.com, it is much more convenient that having to run to BRU every week and with Prime shipping, I can have it at my door in two days.

review/summary: Does the job for my baby...price isn't competitive
review/text: When my baby girl was born, I exclusively breastfed. Soon thereafter, I started supplementing just a tad. I knew I would be returning to work at four months and didn't want to continue pumping while working....I froze a good amount of breastmilk that lasted until she was 5 months. I started with Similac Advance. As the months progressed, I started increasing her formula and decreasing her breastmilk(very slowly) intake. We finally reached a point when her bottles had a higher volume of formula rather than breastmilk and I started noticing more gas and tummy troubles.  I decided to switch to sensitive and it worked beautifully....back to the happy baby she was, sans the gas and tummy issues. She is currently eight and half months and has been on Similac Sensitive since she was about 12 weeks. At about 5 months, like stated previously, she was solely on this formula(no breastmilk), No problems that we've encountered since switching. She takes this just fine with all of her solids.<br />My only complaint is that the price isn't competitive. I'm having to go to that freakin' zoo of a place(Babies R Us) to get the 6-pack. Ugh, I hate that place. Always a bajillion people in line with only two cashiers and the aisles are an engineering fail. Parents, can I get an AMEN?<br />Other than the latter, formula does the trick it needs to do.

review/text: My baby is lactose intolerant and had diarrhea and wasn't gaining weight.  We switched to this about three months ago and he's gained a couple of pounds and inches and looks very healthy.  He does seems to be getting eczema though so we might try the Similac Alimentum to be sure it's not this formula.  We rinse his mouth out with water after a feeding which seems to help with his skin.

review/summary: The only one for us
review/text: It took us trying about five different formulas before we got to this one. Now, it's the only thing we can feed our daughter without her spitting up 3-6 times after eating. Even the same fussiness and gas powder didn't work for us. ... It's either this or the concentrate, and they don't sell the concentrate on Amazon for a reasonable price. ... One last thing: This is a fantastic product, but if you have a Toys R Us/Babies R Us anywhere in your vicinity, it's worth driving to get the concentrate. It'll save you about $16 per two cases, which for us means about $8-10 per week. (One case of concentrate provides the same amount of food as two cases of ready to feed.)

review/summary: Good for lactose issues
review/text: There have been some harsh reviews about the ingredients in the liquid Similac Sensitive.  It is true that milk based formula should be first choice as it is closest to mother's milk.  When milk can't be used due to a lactose intolerance, another form of carbohydrate is needed.  Corn maltodextrin is just an easily digested sugar.  It IS used as a "filler" in adult food.  This is not always a good thing because as adults  we don't need extra empty calories.  Babies DO need the calories and easily processed sugar are a gentile way to get them.  There is a history of (baby and adult) lactose intolerance on my husbands side.  After trying to reduce gas in many other ways, we switched and have seen a great reduction in gas amount and pains.  It has not been a cure, but with other gas management techniques, we are all happier.<br /><br />Pros: Already made for travel or middle of the night feedings.  Good for babies that are sensitive to lactose.<br />Cons: Some complain about the dark formula color stains.  Higher price than powder.

review/summary: didn't really save me the trouble though
review/text: With the powder formula, we have to mix it with filtered water which we thought was inconvenient at night, which is why I bought this.  However it turns out the opened bottle has to be refrigerated. We don't want to feed our baby with very cold formula, so we end up having to warm it up... net net it's probably more trouble.  and it's more expensive than the powder version.  So, either buy the powder version, or buy the ready-to-feed formula in 2-oz bottles... This version doesn't make a lot of sense.  I wanted to return it but decided to bite the bullet... not very fun.

review/summary: love it!
review/text: We use them for our dogs' mouthing and teething.  It works.  They love it and thus do not touch furnitures and others they are not supposed to.  Also we put some meat or peanut butter into the bone when they are bored.  They love it, too!

review/summary: The Doggy Pacifier
review/text: We refer to these bones as "the baby sitters" since our Labs can spend hours chewing on them. Their teeth are kept very clean thanks to friction with the hard, porous surface. Just pop your doggie's favourite soft treat into the centre of the bone and hand it over to the dog! A GREAT treat for strong chewers...

review/summary: My husband loved this brand - and now, so do I
review/text: My husband loves, and would only eat the pepperoni version of slim jims.  They became hard to find around town, so being the good wife that I am (ha ha).  I started a subscription so I can still get them for him.  However, I finally tried one.  HUGE mistake.  Now I want one a day.  Then my mom asked to try one.  Another HUGE mistake.  Now for every one that we have...my husband MAY get one.  These are so good, it's scary.  Someone may determine that they are trying to take over the world!.

review/summary: Good Nuts Poor Packing
review/text: Always looking for a good deal on Planters Dry Roasted Unsalted peanuts and this is a good deal.  However Amazon still has packing problems and two of the jars were broken on receipt.  Kept the shipment as it was still not a bad price but Amazon needs to QC the packing more carefully.  I will buy them again.

review/summary: Best darn chili in a bag!
review/text: I understand chili is not difficult to make, but this darn chili in a bag is good! It has the right amount of spices and seasoning and it does taste homemade from scratch. Honestly, no one would know it was bought all premixed. Delicious! Our local grocery store no longer sold this product and i searched within our 30 mile radius at local stores, but nada...nothing, so glad amazon had it. Definitely recommend this product!

review/summary: Almost as good as homemade
review/text: I'm very picky in my choice of chili.  The heart of a good chili is the sauce.  My ex-wife used to make a chili sauce that would make you weep with joy.  Unfortunately one of the things she took when she left was the recipe.  One of the secrets is getting just the right balance of chili powders (there are several) and massa (corn flour).  I've been attempting, without success, for over 20 years to duplicate that marvelous dish. It turns out that Shore Lunch knows how it's done.<br /><br />Personally, I don't like their choice of beans, but they come dried, so I pick them out of the bag and replace them with my own.  The result is a nice, mild, great-tasting chili that lets me, finally, thumb my nose at my ex.  Try it.  If it's too mild for you, just add a touch of jalapeno, cayenne, paprika, or habanero to suit your taste.<br /><br />Note: start with a bigger than usual pot.  This bag makes a lot of chili, compared to a canned chili.

review/summary: The Longer It Stays . . .
review/text: This is great chili.  I first bought a pack at a discount grocery "Amazing Savings" and was very surprised at the quality for a packaged mix.  When you first cook it up it's more like a chili soup, very good over a bed of rice.  It thickens in the refrigerator and the longer it stays in the fridge the better the taste as the spices blend more.  So glad I found this on Amazon, as the discount grocer only gets Shore Lunch products sporadically.  Just wish it was a "Subscribe and Save"!

review/text: We just like the previous poster had gone to Pigeon Forge and did the wine sampling and LOVED the peach slushy drink mix! I tried the other one she made, i think it was a raspberry wine but im not sure which freezer she mixed it with. She did say that the raspberry one was the most popular but i didnt like as much course i am not a wine drinker. I found the peach to be a smooth peachy taste and it is sooooo good! Glad i can order more!

review/summary: Absolutely Yummy!
review/text: While we were visiting Pigeon Forge, TN we went to the Apple Barn Winery, and they used these for mixing with the wine they made and sold there.  I have to say it made the wine taste a lot better than it did without it.  I personally am not a wine drinker, but when I tasted the wine mixed with these mixers I was alittle hooked.  It gives the wine a nice slushy texture, and it gives the wine a nice peach flavoring without over powering the taste.  I really liked the addition that this mixers gave to the wine.  I have purchased several of these and would love to try other flavors that they have available.  I would also suggest the strawberry<br />for wine, it is also good.<br /><br />I have not tried the Margarita yet but plan to do so in the future.  These are soooo good that it has got me to be a somewhat of a wine drinker now, which I have never been before. If you would like alittle bit of a twist to your wine then I would suggest trying these, I don't think you will be disappointed.  They are cheap and very tasty.<br /><br />Amazon has the cheapest prices on these, that I have found thus far.  The company sells them on their website, but by the time you pay for shipping its a lot more expensive than purchasing it here on Amazon.

review/summary: Peach Bellini
review/text: You won't be able to put this down once you start it. I mix with a Peach Chardonnay that I've made for several years. It takes about 6 hours to freeze. It can be difficult to dispense, but with a little practice you can get the job done. A sweet, delicious alternative to wine spritzers. Definitely a product I will carry when my winery opens.

review/summary: Wonderful drink on a hot summer day
review/text: We bought the Peach Bellini at Hillside Winery in Pigeon Forge, TN and mixed it with their Casa Bianca wine.  Boy was it ever good.  It sure did hit the spot on a hot summer day.  The only downfall was that it was hard to squeeze out of the bag, so we cut the top off and then put the mixture in a plastic pitcher and spooned it out into our glasses.  Definitely buying more of this product.

review/summary: Solid Gold Hundenflocken
review/text: Solid Gold Hundenflocken was recommended to me for my miniture Yorkie.  She has had pancreatitis several times and I didn't know what was causing it.  Someone suggested it may be all the preservatives in the regular dog foods.  She has been on Solid Gold Hundenflocken for 4 years now and has not had any more trouble with pancreatitis.  This is a great product!
