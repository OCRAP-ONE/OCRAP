review/summary: price is way too high!
review/text: The price from 911drugstore is crazy!  If you buy the spinach, mango and pear one, which amazon itself sells, it is half the price (see link) of 911drugstore and about twice what you'd pay retail.  Don't buy from this company. They are price gouging.<br /><br />That said, all of this band of baby food that I've tried are great.  I don't even use a spoon, my son likes to just suck it right out of the tube and has been since he was 7months old.  Great for road trips or just being on the go<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030VJ8PE">HAPPYBABY Organic Baby Food, Stage 2, Spinach, Mango & Pear, 3.5 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 16)</a>

review/summary: My son's favorite food!
review/text: Our son is 6 months old. This was his first mix of foods after he's had his first foods an ingredient at a time...You should see how he opens his mouth big like he's about to swallow me whole every single time I bring one of these to him and am about to open it. It is so convenient, too...because when we are out at the park or after a doctor's appointment and he's hungry, I can just take one of these out of the diaper bag and squeeze it into the spoon for him to eat it. Also, when he only has half of it, we put the rest in the fridge and then in the evening we heat it up in a bowl of hot water. It's also great that we never actually touch the food w/ the spoon, so no bacteria goes into the pouch...We love it...We really have no negatives about it...I'm about to order a new batch now as we're vising some friends in TX next week and we need to grab food for the plane and also for the trip. These are great because they're not as heavy as the jars.

review/summary: Tastes good but VERY watery
review/text: All of the Happy Baby Stage 2 Foods I have ordered have had an excellent flavor, but the puree is a very watery consistency that requires me to mix in cereal just so it holds onto the spoon long enough to make it to my daughters mouth. If your baby is past basic introductions where you water it down to a soupy consistency I would try another brand or the next stage or two up. Very disappointed because the flavor is great.

They are great for vacation when you can't control meals quite as much as home i know he is still getting some better foods in his diet. My son is now 2 and i don't see an end to him enjoying these!

review/text: I was happy to see the list of ingredients here listing the peas and broccoli before the pears, thinking that as in package ingredients the larger ingredients are listed first. But after ordering I see on the package ingredient list that, yes, pears are the majority of the ingredients. Common but misleading the way this prodcut description was written.

review/summary: Sweet and a little tart, but delicious and fresh!
review/text: We were a bit apprehensive about purchasing this banana, beet and blueberry flavor after reading several reviews that it was sour and their children did not like the taste.  However, our 8-month old daughter loved this flavor and in fact, hasn't opened her mouth as widely for any of the other Happy Baby flavors as she did with this one.  The consistency looks like a berry smoothie and it smelled great.  So I tasted it and it does have a bit of a tart taste, but it's very slight to me.  I almost wanted to finish it because it had just enough sweetness to go with the slightly tart taste.  It's too bad this isn't made in the 4.2oz package because our daughter usually wants just a bit more than what comes in this package.<br /><br />It is a bit more expensive than some other organic brands, but well worth the price.  In our opinion, the flavors taste so much more natural and fresh and taste great to us as adults rather than having that "baby food" type of taste that many brands have.<br /><br />Also, there is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L4BV5U">Plum Organics Dispensing Boon Spoon, 2-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> that can screw onto this packaging as well as the Plum Organics packages of food.  It comes with a carrying case for the spoon tips.  This makes feeding time so much easier when you screw the spoon onto the package and then can easily throw away the package and put the spoon tip back in the case rather than having to bring a separate spoon and container to squeeze the food into so you can feed your baby.

review/summary: Too sour, 16 months old doesn't like it at all. A waste of my money!!!
review/text: My boy is not a picky eater. He likes these pouched food except this flavor: it is too sour, even I have a problem with it! He is eager to try, sometimes he even takes it out of the food storage box and asks me to open for him, but after one sip or two, he gives up. Now I am stuck with a box of these, not knowing what to do with it. I'd like to give them away, but if my son doesn't like them, how can I know if other babies will eat it? I will not buy them again. My mistake was that I didn't read all the reviews on this item :(. A hard lesson learned!

review/text: We love these. They are absolutely delicious and the handy pouch is convenient for sipping on the go. A previous reviewer indicated the puree is a bit thin for a spoon and I agree with that. However, it doesn't bother me because if your diaper bag space is at a premium, like mine, you can forget the spoon and just sip from the pouch. My 7 month old has no problem doing this.

review/summary: Too sweet!
review/text: We generally make food for our little one at home, but I wanted to try a couple pouches because they seem like a good option for throwing into the diaper bag.  I chose the Happy Baby Broccoli, Peas and Pear because of the great reviews from other parents.  It's true, our baby opens his mouth WIDE for this stuff.  He is a fairly good eater of whatever we give him, but I don't think I've seen him this excited to eat since he first started on solids.  The problem is, I tasted a tiny bit of it and it was extremely sweet.  The package doesn't list any additional sugars or sweeteners, but I find it hard to believe that pears can be THAT sweet.  Even if the sugar comes 100% from the pears and is natural, I still think it's too much.  I'll be mixing it in with oatmeal until it's done and after that I will try a couple other brands to see if there is anything less sweet out there.  If not...I'll just have to suck it up and bring homemade food with me everywhere.

review/text: My baby started refusing baby food at 9 mos and my 2.5yr old is a picky eater. I started ordering all of the different flavors of the HappyBaby and HappyTot (which has the magic supergrain Salba in them)line through the automatic delivery service (which lowers the price/amazon mom's helps too) and I call them smoothies. My toddler gobbles these up and asks for more! Even the ones that are green bean, peas, pear, and salba. It's like a miracle! My baby eats them too, but not with quite as much enthusiasm. It makes me feel so nice that my kids are getting some good for them stuff and I don't need to break my neck trying to do it. Oh and they are wonderfully anti-messy. I shove a few in my purse when I know we will be out during hungry times.

review/text: I'm a busy mom with two jobs and a 6 month old. I want to make my own baby food but I really don't even have five extra minutes to do that. HappyBaby pouches are my go to! I started adding Apple Cherry to my daughters cereal because she didn't want to eat the rice cereal plain. Now she gobbles it up! I feel good that she is getting awesome organic fruit in her cereal that doesn't have added sugar or color and it only took me a few seconds to get it prepared for her.

review/summary: Perfect for the busy Mom!
review/text: Happy Family Pouches are so convenient, healthy and easy for little ones to use. Like most households, our mornings are super crazy and these are so perfect to use on the go and in the car. Banana Kiwi is one of our favorites. I love that all of the products are Organic and GMO-Free. I also thought that the price was very reasonable and would definitely order this again. Try mixing a bit of it into Happy Family Organic Oatmeal for a new twist on breakfast for the kids. Happy Family is a must have in our house :)

review/summary: Great flavor combination
review/text: We're big HappyBaby fans here, and this flavor pouch is one of my favorites for my son, who is now two. I tried to make my own baby food for him when we were first introducing solids, but I had trouble finding all the fresh organic fruits and vegetables during certain times of the year -- and apricot was one of them. I would have never thought to combine apricots and sweet potatoes on my own, but the combination works! I love that it is really nutrient dense and an easy snack for on the go. My son is in the picky-eater phase and these pouches help get the veggies in! I also think this pouch is the reason behind his current love of dried apricots :) Overall, this is a great flavor combination and a super nutritious food for little ones.<br /><br />I don't find that these pouches are runny like other commenters have mentioned, FYI.

review/summary: Great Flavor Combo
review/text: I ordered this product when my baby was starting solids and loved that it had the sweet potato and apricot combo.  What a unique blend.  He is now 16 months and it is one of his favorite HappyBaby flavors.  In fact, he just gobbled one up at lunch today.  He is at the age where giving him snacks on the go is difficult.  I don't always have time to do a bib and highchair for snacks.  I can give him this pouch and it keeps him satisfied until lunch or dinner, and I know he is consuming food that is good for his growing body!

review/text: We love the organic food combination that Happy Family develops-the unique combo of broccoli, peas, and pears exposes babies to both fruit and veggies.  The packaging (that is BPA FREE) is perfect for on the go, travel, snacks on airplanes, and every day meals!  So glad to see the products in more stores. So affordable as well.

I feel good about giving my babies something like this. The taste is better than any other brand's pouches that we've tried. I like mixing it in their cereal. I also LOVE the fact that you can squirt it out into a spoon and not contaminate the rest of the pouch. Great product!

review/text: I love having one of these pouches in my diaper bag. They are so convenient when we are on the go - at a restaurant, in the grocery store or over at a friends house. You don't need a spoon and they don't make a mess. I hardly have to wipe my 11 month old daughter's face when we are done. I am a fan! I also love that I can screw the top back on and stick it in the fridge if she doesn't finish the whole thing. The best part is that my daughter is getting organic fruits and veggies, and she loves it!

review/text: I love all of the HappyBaby pouches because of their fresh taste and healthy ingredients. My toddlers love feeding themselves with these. I also mix it in their yogurt and even make smoothies for myself. This is one of my favorite flavors to use because of the health benefits of blueberries and beets (plus my little ones love the taste!) HappyBaby makes it so easy to introduce my kids to a wide variety of fruits and veggies.

review/summary: Update: Runny Consistency Good on the Go!
review/text: My daughter loves this (as well as every other Happy Baby food she has tried)! The only reason I docked a star is because the consistency is thin. I normally mix all of her Stage 2 foods with cereal, so it's not a big deal for us. However, if your baby eats this straight, try one of the various "squeezie" spoons on the market. It is too runny to use a traditional spoon.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I changed my rating to five stars. Yes, it's still a bit runny. However, I have found this to actually be a good thing.<br /><br />My daughter is almost seven months old. We were out the other day, and I had a pouch of this food in the diaper bag. I had just gotten her seated for lunch when I realized that I'd forgotten her bowl, spoon, and cereal to mix with the food. I decided to let her try to "eat" it directly from the pouch. (We both drink homemade green smoothies a lot. The consistency is similar.) It was great! She was easily able to suck it out of the pouch, with me holding the pouch, making sure that there was always food near the opening. She only spilled a tiny bit onto her bib. It also took less than five minutes for her to eat!<br /><br />I am going to keep a pouch of this food in the diaper bag from now on. It's great that I don't have to worry about carting a bowl, spoon, and container of cereal anymore. However, I will continue to mix it with cereal at home.

review/text: My 2 year old loves these tots!  I started feeding these to my son when I would squeeze them in to a bowl and feed with a spoon when he was under a year.  After that, I would give the pouch to him and he would drink it like it had a straw in it.  It wasn't messy at all!<br />The spinach gives it a savory taste while the mango and pear make it a bit sweet~the falvors combined are perfect!<br />It's a great snack to throw into your purse.<br />I also like the it's dairy and gluten free and not processed in a facility that processes nuts1

review/summary: Used to be the only way I could get veggies down my baby!
review/text: Before trying these pouches, I would attempt to hide veggies in my daughter's baby cereal and fruit puree.  I could put the tiniest bit in her bowl and she would always detect it.  I'm sure she would have survived without veggies, but it still bothered me that she wasn't eating any.  (It's a mom thing I guess!)  I saw these in the store and thought that the combinations of fruits and veggies in these looked "interesting."  I picked up a few, not really expecting my little one to like them.  However, she really liked them - a lot.  Maybe it has something to do with the fact that they come in a pouch that she can feed to herself.<br /><br />Not only were these great to give her as an infant, she still enjoys these as a toddler.  These are great to take with on outings - when it's otherwise difficult to give her produce.  She can eat these without making a mess and we don't have to worry about spoilage.  So far, she has liked all of the flavors.  I like the fact that these aren't stored in plastic or in jars with BPA.  I wish that these would have been available years ago.  :)

review/summary: What a great snack
review/text: These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches. Figure it's more nutritious than eating goldfish crackers for a meal.

review/text: I love these little food packs.  I squeeze the puree directly onto a spoon and feed my baby, and that way no dishes get dirty other than the spoon.  He loves these purees, he'll eat any flavor and they seem quite natural and healthy.  As he gets older he can even suck directly out of the pouch, though sometimes he squeezes too hard and makes a little mess if I let him hold it himself.  They are also super portable and conveniently stored.

review/text: So I bought a couple of these for my son's birthday party to put in a goody bag for the babies that were attending. The moms went crazy over them. I don't find the consistency to be thin like other reviews have expressed. In fact, I ended up using the left over pouches for my 5 year old daughter's lunches. I used it on her almond butter sandwiches instead of jelly. So I thought the consistency was fine.<br />The taste was obviously delicious as my daughter didn't even notice the difference. Plus organic, no GMO, BPA free...can't really beat that.

I started cooking for him since he was 5 months old and he ate well but something happened when I went back to work and he no longer accepts "good" food. However, he happily ate entire pack of HappyBaby Spinach, Mango & Pear and asked for more two days in the row! My husband is a Mr. Mom for now so weight off his shoulders as far as feeding. We ordered other flavors and hoping trend with eating organic veggies and fruits will continue with our picky eater.

review/text: My 8 month old has eaten nearly on the flavors of ellas, happy baby/tot, and sprout meals.  This one is so tart, she shuttered with a sour face and then started to cry- something that NEVER happens.  I tasted it and it is pretty sour (I like sour), perhaps overwhelmingly so for a fresh pallette (not a beat up adult one). I served it along with a savory meal and she was fine with that but I wont be buying it again.  May be good for an adult smoothie where you want some tang.

They are such a fantastic way to get quality foods into picky bodies.<br /><br />However, this is the only combo that he has refused to eat.  I've tried it multiple times, and he continues to leave the pouch full after taking just one sip.  The rest he will slurp down until even the air is out of the package ;)<br /><br />I'd order any of the other combinations if I were you.

review/text: My son has a very high gag reflex and transitioning to solids has been a task.  However, he also won't have anything to do with homemade baby food anymore.  We found these pouches when buying food for a trip and he was hooked.

I love that they are getting good, organic nutrition, and that the ingredients are wholesome.  They are very convenient to throw in your diaper bag or purse on-the-go, or to stick in a lunch box for a snack.  We use a spoon and sometimes a bowl at home for self feeding with my little one, but you can also give the pouch to them to eat directly from the squeeze pouch.

review/text: I purchased this item, as well as the Oskri almond granola, as a healthful alternative to my current snack regimen. I was hoping for something more "clean" than the usual crap available at my local grocers. However, I did not realize that I would be sacrificing flavor. This granola was not good at all. The morsels were clumped together and there was overwhelmingly unpleasant taste. In addition, each package is actually two servings (i.e. more calories, fat, sugar, and carbs = not healthy). This item is not what I had expected nor anticipated. I will eat fruit or something else instead.

review/summary: Awesome Healthy Granola Choice
review/text: For everyone considering purchasing this granola, it is buckwheat.  All of these other reviews don't take in to consideration it is NOT oats or wheat.  It is a healthy, wholesome alternative and gluten free.  Yes, it has a different smell and taste, that is buckwheat.  No chemicals or GMOs or other crap to make it taste artificially sweet.  Buckwheat is naturally a little strong tasting and smelling.  All that be said, I like the granola.  It feels you up and you aren't hungry in an hour like with other cereal.  I give it five stars.

review/summary: Great Snack
review/text: I have to say I am a fan. The raisin and pecan work very well together. It's crunchy with just the right amount of sweetness and tastes wonderful by itself or with (almond) milk. It had solid healthy, natural ingredients(just buck wheat, raisins, sunflower seeds, pecans, date syrup, chicory root extract, and rice protein) and pretty good nutrition facts (382 calories, 12 g protein, 13.2 g sugar, 14.6 g fat, 14.6 g fiber, no sodium for the whole bag.) And, the product was produced with renewable energy in the USA, according to the bag. Also, it's vegan, halal, and kosher.<br /><br />Its the perfect size to take to school, work, or just eat when you need a little snack. It keeps you full for hours.<br /><br />I am a little ashamed to admit I have eaten 5 bags two days, just because I have been enjoying it so much.<br /><br />The only thing that I think could make this product better is if they made all their ingredients organic.

review/text: I ordered this to use in my popcorn machine.  I was uneasy about how the kettle would handle this product, but since I have a great kettle cleaner I went ahead and ordered it.  I am sure glad that I did because this is FABULOUS!  It leaves no mess in the kettle at all.  When it starts to pop the first kernels that come out are the best coated ones and then as more pop they get less coated, but if you mix them all together I think you get great flavor.  Just remember this is a sticky coating when it first comes out so unpopped kernels stick to the popped ones so watch out for those.  Still a great tasting product that I will keep purchasing...  Just so you know I love this flavor, but a few friends said they did not like the flavor itself.

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I'm not naturally drawn to any tea, but for health reasons I've been trying to pick it up for years, mostly trying green teas. I never could make a habit of it until I found a small box of this locally. In the past 5 months, I've averaged 4 cups a day and have officially developed a healthy habit. I'm still not in love with the taste, though I find white tea easier to stomach than some green teas that were grassier, but I do enjoy the experience of drinking white tea and I enjoy its effects. Rather than a caffeine buzz, teas have a balance of caffeine and l-theanine that provide mental clarity and aids focus, and the balance in white tea is just right for me.<br /><br />POP white tea brews darker than a more costly white tea I was given, and I do suspect that darker color means lower quality, but the price is right. The bags also brew more cups than an equivalent bag of black tea, furthering the value. I have no trouble getting 6 large cups of tea from a single bag, and arguably, the second cup is better than the first. I'm on my second box of 100 from Amazon, and having recently discovered this listing that offers subscribe and save, I'm likely to buy much more in the future.  Previously this was an $.08 per day, $.02 per cup habit, but now it could be a $.05 per day, $.01 per cup habit.  How many healthy habits are this affordable?

review/summary: The only cat food I serve
review/text: After much research into healthy wet food options for my cats I decided on Whiskas because of the nutritional value and the fact that the first ingredient isn't a by-product or wheat gluten listed. My cats love Whiskas and I know they are happy eating this everyday. The package can be a little tricky to get the food out without making a mess. I've mastered how to open it though - hold at the top and shake all the food to the bottom of the package. Open the top at the notch and squeeze the sides so it opens then shake out all the food! (I think those directions are right on the package but I apparently didn't see them until after my trial and error.)

review/summary: Counterfeit cat food??
review/text: Note: This review is specifically for this Cat food, sold by Amazon.com in a Pack of 48 pouches. Purchased in February of 2012.<br /><br />We have an extremely picky cat with health issues who will eat nothing but Whiskas Seafood pouches (not even the other Whiskas pouches). We've purchased this food from a number of different sources but noticed that it cost 50-70% less on Amazon, so we ordered a large quantity. Right as we started feeding our cat the food purchased on Amazon, he suddenly started leaving large amounts of food (which we had to throw away) and losing weight rapidly. We did not initially associate this with the food, and assumed it was a health issue, but could find no evidence of any problem. It was as if the cat suddenly had gone off his food.<br /><br />Fast forward three weeks or so: We've been feeding our cat Amazon's Whiskas, throwing away half of what he leaves in the bowl, and are still having no luck trying different types of food. Suddenly it occurs to me that his new 'health problem' started when we began giving him the Whiskas pouches from Amazon. So I examine the pouches, and here is what I find:<br /><br />- The packaging is in every way identical.<br /><br />- The consistency is much thinner. Where the gravy is thick and clings to the package in Whiskas pouches from Safeway/Petsmart/Petco, the gravy is watery in the Amazon version. This is best described as: The Amazon stuff immediately pours from the package, whereas the stuff from other stores has to be squeezed out and sticks to the side of the pouch.<br /><br />- The expiration dates on Amazon's pouches differs from the date on Amazon's boxes. The expiration dates on Safeway/Petsmart/Petco boxes is consistent: the same on the pouch as on its box.<br /><br />- Both Amazon and other food had an expiration date that was Jan/Feb/March of 2013, so nothing was expired and they were supposedly all manufactured around the same time.<br /><br />- Amazon's cat food is mysteriously WAY cheaper than even Petsmart. 50% cheaper. That is a suspiciously huge price difference for a 'grocery store item', even for Amazon's great prices.<br /><br />So I go to the store, get some more of Safeway's Whiskas Seafood pouches. As soon as I put it in the cat's bowl, he hungrily starts biting into it, as if he hasn't eaten in weeks. (and he barely has!) We finish the box of Safeway Whiskas pouches, and before contacting Amazon, I decide to switch back to the remaining Amazon pouches to see what happens: The cat doesn't eat it. Will not touch it. He won't even lick the gravy off of it, which is normally the first thing he does. I gave him the food this morning, and he hasn't eaten a bite. I let the other cats into his feeding room (they're on dry food but will eat his wet food when they get a chance), and not one of them touches the food.<br /><br />After the food has sat there completely untouched for about 10 hours, I go to amazon.com to initiate a return. Turns out you're not allowed to return this kind of consumable! However, knowing Amazon's history of being an exceptionally fair and honest company, I contacted customer service, and explained the problem to them. They immediately processed a refund, with full apologies, no need to return the item. (I'm throwing it away)<br /><br />So thank you Amazon for your outstanding customer service. I greatly appreciate it and will remain a frequent Amazon customer as I have been for 15 years. I've asked your customer service rep to open an investigation to find out if this cat food is counterfeit. I will apparently receive a report about the investigation.<br /><br />In the meantime I recommend to customers that you do not order the Whiskas Pouches through this page (maybe a different provider through Amazon would be fine). You may risk feeding your animals counterfeit (possibly harmful) food.

review/text: A lot of cats don't like chunky types of food, however, these Whiskas pouches have become my cat's favorite meal.  For me, they are extremely easy - just tear open a pouch, fill her dish, discard the pouch. It was very easy to order them online, the price was comparable to regular store prices, and  shipping was free and fast.  Just keep in mind these are not smooth canned foods - these are big chunks in sauce.  Make sure your cat likes them before ordering in bulk.

review/summary: One of very few foods my cat likes
review/text: My two cats really love this food. I have one senior cat who is very picky, will only eat some seafood flavor foods and that's it. She has started to show signs of kidney failure and I was told a low protein diet would be better for her. This is one of the lowest protein foods I could find and Miss Picky Eater likes it. They both like to lick the gravy off first and generally eat the pieces too, but not all the time. They both seem to like the salmon flavor least, so I try to give them that one when I've been gone for a long day and I know they're extra hungry when I return. Love the auto delivery at a discount price too. I know my 2 cats go through about 1 box per week, so it's easy to calculate how much food is needed.

review/summary: My Cats Like These
review/text: I have to push their heads out of the way to finish emptying the pouches into the bowl - one cat in particular typically ends up wearing some on her head. It has lots of "sauce" and that seems to be their favorite part. They lick it all thoroughly, then go back and enthusiastically eat the meat part.<br /><br />While the pouches are infinitely superior to metal cans (I always worry about me or the cats cutting ourselves), they are still a bit messy. I always seem to end up trying to get the last bit out with a spoon and getting it on my hands. And of course, like all wet food, it stinks to the high heavens.

review/text: I bought the Whiskas Choice Cuts Seafood Variety Pack for my cats because they were starting to eat wet food (I had had some success with some canned foods), and it looked like good-quality, succulent food that I hoped my cats would enjoy. However, my cats had other ideas. They liked licking the juice (one nice thing about this product: the food is nice and juicy), but they left the meat to sit, ignored. I tried a couple different flavors, same result. I also found it difficult to get the food out of the pouches; cans are much easier to work with.<br /><br />So, the unused pouches went back to the store for a full refund, which was nice. But too bad; I had hoped this would be a good food for my kitties. But I can't force-feed 'em, so...

review/summary: Okay
review/text: My cats love this stuff, but I kept having trouble with auto ordering.  Also once I got a case that had a few rotten packets in it; I had to throw away the whole box the packet was in and they would not give a refund.  After the rotten packet I switched to Tiki Cat which is healthier and more natural.

review/summary: You've priced yourself out of the acceptable market
review/text: What gives?  You WERE economical for a while, and now your price has gone up almost $10 on the product.  Fuel hasn't gone up that much.  I guess it's back to shopping at Walmart.
