review/summary: Sturdy and easy to use!
review/text: I love these bags. Used one for the first time this year. It held my 13 lb turkey with all the brine very well with room to spare. The ziplock part was super easy to use and close so you don't accidentally lose brine and icky turkey juices all over the floor. It is thick and easy to manhandle. I'm back to buy more for upcoming years!  Happy Thanksgiving to you all!

review/summary: Best I've Tried
review/text: These are the best rice cakes I've tried. They actually have taste and a light crisp texture. They do tend to be a bit crumbly, but overall really good. I go through a package of them in a couple of days and I have not had any problem with them going stale before I can eat them up.

review/summary: These are good !!!
review/text: I think these are good. I've losing weight so I eat a couple of these ( plain/w coffee ) for breakfast to keep the weight loss effect going. I find myself thinking about eating them at other times, but I normally don't. A glass of water and 2 of these will work wonders if you can't resist the urge to eat something. These are good plain or you can put something on them. I've got quite a few broken ones because of the shipping, but not a problem for me.

review/summary: The BEST brand of rice cakes
review/text: Lundberg makes the absolutely best rice cakes out there. They are substantial, crunchy, and have a wonderful rice flavor. If you've ever tried the other brand's product, you know that the other rice cakes taste and feel like styrofoam. Not these! They're so good that my kids ask for them. Plus they are 100% gluten free for those who need to be concerned about that. Amazon ships these in a sturdy box. All of the sleeves came intact. What an easy way to shop.

review/summary: Light And Crispy. Fresh and Tasty.
review/text: I used to regularly eat rice cakes and then I got out of the habit and haven't even seen them for years. Suddenly I spotted some Lundberg Eco-Farmed Brown Rice Cakes at my nearby grocery store and had to have them. They're made of whole-grain brown rice and are very lightly salted. They're nice and fresh and crispy and good tasting. I like to have them for breakfast with spreads ranging from peanut butter, Nutella, and a variety of fruit spreads. And they're only 60 calories a cake. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Perfect Staple
review/text: Lundberg sets the bar when it comes to rice cakes. This is truly the perfect staple and when you need something healthy while traveling, rice cakes are the ideal solution.  I've even been known to carry them in my purse into a restaurant so I have an option to the potato or rice that the chef smothers in butter or some other sauce full of fat.  Lightness in the belly that shows up on the bathroom scale.

review/summary: Very stale, can't give them away
review/text: I took a chance on these, aware that a lot of food sellers on Amazon sell very stale product, and I lost my wager. These rice cakes were extremely stale. I bit into one and instantly regretted my decision. I had to go to a local store to buy some new ones the next day, as these were not appetizing. I have been trying to give them away to roommates and friends, but none of them want them! I guess I'll try to donate them to a food bank or else just throw them away.

review/summary: The Shipping Box Says Handle With Care
review/text: As rice cakes go these are pretty good, but the shipping the last two times I've purchased has not been acceptable.<br /><br />These are rice cakes in plastic bags. That means they are fragile and the bags will tear.  Removing a section off the shipping box, exposing 4 bags, and then thoroughly taping the exposed bags with packing tape is not very smart.  The exposed bags are beaten up, and it is impossible to remove packing tape from a plastic bag without tearing the bag.<br /><br />The first time I thought it was an accident, but twice?

review/summary: Our Dogs Love Them
review/text: I first bought a box of these LICK 'N CRUNCH! dog cookies as a Christmas gift for my Dad's little rat terrier, Buddy. My dad always had a little Christmas gift for Buddy and we have tried to keep doing that since my dad's death.  Buddy loves these treats! I've given some to my sister's dog (a collie-mix) and the dog next door (a little Yorkshire terrier). They love them, too. The cookies resemble brown Oreo or Hydrox cookies. These cookies are made by the Three Dog Bakery, a company in Missouri that specializes in making baked treats specifically for dogs. Not only are these treats made in the USA, but they are also made with all-natural ingredients. You can't always give a dog people food, but you can get them the next best thing, dog cookies from the Three Dog Bakery.

review/text: I received these dog treats that I had purchased for my Shih-tzu "Zach". As I was unpackaging them, my two granddaughters just happened to be standing there. Both of the girls, one 11 and one 7 years old, thought that these treats were really oreo cookies, and each girl wanted one of these to eat. My dog loved these treats. The girls (I hope), will never know!

review/summary: Great pump and less tingling feeling!
review/text: Over the past two years, i have been working out 5 days a week. I have tried a ton of different pre-workout supplements. I am little older now and so I wanted something that would make me have enough energy to finish and complete my entire workout.<br /><br />I not only try and change my workouts every 6 months or when I feel like I have hit a plateau in my workout, but I often try different supplements to see if i can see any difference.<br /><br />Labrada Super Charge is freaking awesome. I can take one scoop and within about 15 minutes, I can feel it working. I don't get the weird tingling like you do with Jack 3d and other products, but you can just feel it. I always start my workouts with 5 minute warm-up and I always check my heart rate. This stuff doesn't make your heart go crazy or cause any other strange side affects.<br /><br />On certain days, in my case Leg days, I take about a scoop and half, because I seem to always be weaker and lazier on leg days, because they are my weakest muscle group. But this stuff lets me kick into a higher gear and complete my workout.<br /><br />For the money, it is currently my favorite. Supplements can get expensive, so i always try and be selective in where i spend money.

review/text: 240mg of caffeine, creatine, and aminos gives me just what I need to power through every workout.  It lasts just long enough and I never feel the 'I'd rather be not here now' feeling when in the gym.  One scoop is sufficient for most.  If it takes two, I'd worry about the effects on your body.  This has allowed me to push my limits and has lead to an increase in strength and size over the past 6 months.  It's no anabolic, but does give you the kick in the pants you need to have a consistently good workout routine.  **** Don't take this before you do any intense cardio, your heart will notice it. :-)

review/text: I didn't know they made a " Watered down cheap bubblegum " Flavor....They made a mistake and put the fruit punch label on my jug. I got the wrong flavor<br /><br />I use to love the taste of the first Supercharge 2005-2008 humanofort formula (Tasted awesome) and then the Supercharge Xtreme came out 2008-2010 humanofort formula(Tasted very good) and now we have Supercharge Xtreme without humanofort and different formula all together (tasted decent) and now the batches from a year later (Taste like crap) what is up with the flavor Labrada? Fruit Punch? taste like chemical bubble gum and the flavoring system here is very weak, it use to be very concentrated and good and seems to keep getting worse. What will this stuff taste like next year??? Sewer Water? It's not to far off. Companies get cheap and don't want to spend money on flavoring and a once EPIC product taste like crap.<br /><br />Not impressed, would rather spend a little more and have it be top quality like the previous versions of Supercharge. The 2008 to 2010 Version was sooooo freaking awesome, maybe not the best tasting of all the versions, but the effects were second to none. No Humanofort? I loved Humanofort why in the hell did you take it out of the product? Mixing issues? bullcrap, it worked so it had something expensive in it. Chicken Egg Embryos. You cheaped up on us Lee. You use to have quality I could trust.

review/summary: Best pre-workout mix
review/text: I used to workout when i played baseball, but after i stopped playing i gained a lot of weight. We recently decided to change our lifestyle before we have kids so we can be there for them and do the things parents need to do.<br /><br />Over the years i've tried many different products and this is the best tasting pre-workout mix that actually works. My pumps are harder and i can go longer. I've gained a lot of weight and i need to get back in shape - so for the past 3 weeks i've used this as a pre-work out mix before my workouts and muscle milk light after my workouts. I've been using this, muscle milk light and amazing grass (vegetable/fruit drink mix) as breakfast. 3.5oz of steak or chicken for lunch and a normal dinner (usually before 6). I've lost 22 pounds in 3 weeks and my wife can tell a huge difference in the way i look. I have not been doing any cardio - just strictly lifting. We just bought an elliptical this week so i plan to start that soon as well. I'm amazed at the results so far and plan to continue.<br /><br />I highly recommend this workout mix to anyone wanting to build lean muscle.

I won't make any ridiculous unfounded claims, but for myself I feel it's great before and during intense cardio and helps my endurance. I've taken it on mountaineering expeditions for the ascent, and found it works great for that as well. YMMV.

review/text: I took a chance on this one, since it isn't being advertised out the wazu like all the others.  I did do a little research, and there are a lot of good comments out there.  I liked it very much.  I started with black powder and it was a little crazy for me, then lost it's effectiveness very quickly, but even in the beginning after about an hour there was a big crash.<br /><br />I've been using superpump 250 and jacked 3d, alternating it with this.  I love it.  I feel a great pump, energy, and no crash later.  It does last a little more than an hour, but after you ease off, and if you're in the gym two hours like me, by the end I feel like normal.  But no crash where I'm dragging my feet.  I would definitely buy this again when it runs out.<br /><br />I am not a big fan or supplements, I drink a protein shake after the gym, and really like this stuff to give me a pick me up when I go.  Cause it's sure tough on your own at 5am or 5 pm after a long day of work.<br /><br />In others words, "Great Stuff!"  And you can quote me on that ;)

review/summary: Great Energy
review/text: This product works for me. I take it about 30 minutes before a workout at Gold's Gym, and have more than enough energy. I'm steadily handling heavier weights too. One major factor is the 200 mg of caffeine it contains. Lambrada also makes a grape flavor, which I didn't like. Fruit punch is fine with me. This product, coupled with protein supplements, allows me to lose body fat (especially around the waist) while increasing muscle mass.

review/text: Its simply not worth the money. I have been trying NOX products for some time now and find that most of them are a waste of money. Im 38 years old and a gym veteran at this point in very good shape and believe me. nothing substitutes for simple food. I try these products to 'boost' my moodin the morning workouts. Wether or not i am getting vital nutrients to my muscles faster with these products or not, ill continue with simple creatine and anti catabolic supps like Xtend. Sorry Labrada two thumbs down for this one.

review/summary: Cheap Bubblegum is not a Fruit Punch
review/text: When I want a pre-workout drink, it should give me energy and attempt to taste good. I bought two containers of this in Fruit Punch because that's hard to screw up. Not only didn't I get any pep in my step, but it tastes like awful bland bubblegum.<br /><br />Sorry, just didn't do it for me. I stepped it up and got one from the guys who make theAnimal Pak products. Tastes great and I get pumped.

review/text: I don't care for this flavor. The Orange Powder is finer and more dense than the Grape and Punch. You have to use twice the amount of water and It doesn't dissolve well. It taste like ground Vitamin C Pills and has a brownish color when mixed. Maybe I got a bad batch. Grape is the Best.

review/text: I first tried these in a small packet and instantly began seatching for more. They are individually wrapped and great for popping into your mouth after a meal if you can brush your teeth. The combination of ginger and mint leaves you feeling clean and breath fresh-and the ginger is also an excellent digestive. Have gotten my coworkers and friends hooked so will probably be buying some as Christmas gifts they will definitely appreciate!

It will take YEARS and YEARS for them to become a shrub.  I canceled the order within 2 hours of placing it because I realized that I was paying 7.99 for a tiny plant, and Amazon canceled the order just fine.  Hurts went ahead and shipped and charged it to my account.  This was frustraiting.  I have not contacted Hurts because I did not want the hassle or cost of shipping them back.  We'll see if they survive life in zone 5.

They don't sell Flicks anymore but they do sell these.  Same candy, different packaging.  The good thing about these is that you can take 3 or 4 chips, put the package back in the cupboard and have a quick treat without having to eat a whole bar.  If I use a little self control, one of these packages can last a couple of months.  Sometimes they also have a mint flavored version available.  Those are good also.

review/text: We found these pink lemonade fruit snacks at a local Earth Fare store and we were THRILLED with how good they are. My three year-old loves them. Unfortunately I have never seen the pink lemonade in the stores around here, other than Earth Fare (where we don't go all that often). Amazon is so much less expensive than Babies R Us or Toys R Us for these fruit snacks so we just get them via subscribe and save. These fruit snacks (and the other flavors) have been favorite treats of my daughter's for a long time now & we're happy to give them to her since they're organic & all natural.

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks, but try some other flavors.
review/text: I absolutely love Annie's gummies, they healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only reason I gave this particular flavor a 4 instead of 5 stars, is it just doesn't taste as good to me as any of the other Annie's flavors. This particular flavor in my opinion was okay, but no where near as good as some other Annie's flavors. I recommend trying the Summer Strawberry and the Berry Patch flavors as well!!<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices! The Mott's ones are also not organic, and not quite as soft as the Ocean Spray or Annie's, but again, much less expensive.

review/summary: Like a chewable vitamin
review/text: Disclaimer: I have not yet met an Annie's Bunnies product I did not like.  I don't know what it is, but I go wild for cheddar bunnies, sour cream bunnies, bunny crackers, etc.  While grocery shopping one day, my boyfriend mentioned wanting fruit snacks.  We looked in the bulk section and he didn't like the ingredients.  We looked on the shelves and found not one but two brands of organic gummy "fruit snacks."  We bought one box of each brand at about $6 per box.  This was a splurge for us. He liked the other brand the best but I liked the bunnies the best.  I then went online and discovered that they come in all sorts of other flavors.  I chose these pink lemonade ones and enjoy them a lot.  After a meal or in between meals, I often will take a package and have a few.  That is usually all I want.  I suck on them and enjoy the flavor, which is tart, sweet, and fruity.  The flavor and bunnies last a long time.  Sometimes I chew them.  I never finish a packet, even though they are tiny. I paperclip it shut and save it for later.  So because one packet lasts me several periods, in my mind, the price goes down.  They are also a very low calorie snack.  When discussing whether or not to buy more in the future, I noted the nutrition facts and the vitamin C content and now view them as a chewable vitamin for child-at-heart me.  When I get them, I get the enjoyment of having some bunnies with only a few calories and some bonus vitamin C.

review/summary: Who Would Have Thought an Instant Could Be Great
review/text: I love Greek and Turkish Coffee. The problem is that I do not love looking for my Ybrki and standing over the stove waiting while it boils-up twice. One slightly rounded teaspoon of this stuff in a demi-tasse or two if you prefer a standard size coffee cup, sugar to taste, fill with boiling water and voila - really authentic tasting Greek, or if you prefer Turkish, Coffee. Even a hint of "Crema" on the top of the brew. There are no Directions on the can in English so you may have to make adjustments to your liking. The receipes above work fine. You can also put the instant in a cocktail shaker with the same proportions of instant coffee, sugar and water, shake vigorously and pour out a frothy coffee shake over ice. Lagniappe: For calory watchers, sugar substitutes work as well as real sugar.

review/summary: Greek Instant Coffee That You Can't Get (easily) in US Grocery Stores!
review/text: I really enjoyed the Nescafe that we got in the supermarket this summer on our trip to Greece.  Unfortunately, the "Classico" (note the "o" at the end) in US stores doesn't taste anything like this (yuk!).  Having run out of my small supply I brought back on the plane, I searched the web for Nescafe Classic (Freek style) and found this from two sellers online.  I've used Parthenon Foods for most of my orders and while delivery is expensive (~$10 per shipment), shipping does not seem to go up when you purchase more stuff (e.g., 3 cans of coffee instead of 1).  So, I just buy in bulk.<br /><br />Also really enjoyed the Eurocrem (a hazelnut/vanilla based spread) that is used on crepes in some shops in Greece and Yugoslavia.

review/summary: About "Instant Greek Coffee"
review/text: To the person who wrote on June 25, 2011: NesCafe sells different coffees in different parts of the world. To make frappe, you cannot use American or Israeli NesCafe. It must be Greek NesCafe or, as Americans would say it, Greek instant coffee. So... while you are technically correct, the description of this item, to an American, is not wrong. I just served some at a party yesterday, and I have emails from Americans, Russians and a Vietnamese woman asking me about "Greek instant coffee..." This is how they interpret it here!

The American version you can find in stores here is not the same - won't foam up properly - so go for this one.  Add some sugar and milk and shake in a cocktail shaker or throw in the blender, and you have a delicious, creamy treat just like they serve at the cafes in Greece.  Perfect for a hot summer afternoon.

review/summary: Misleading product description
review/text: I'm from Greece and there's no such thing as "instant greek coffee". There seems to be a confusion among reviewers between "frappe" and "greek aka turkish coffee", we are talking about two completely different kinds of coffee. To make frappe,which is cold coffee, you can use ANY KIND of instant coffee, add cold water, milk (if you want), and ice cubes,shake and serve in a tall glass. To make traditional greek aka turkish coffee (the one served in a small cup like espresso) you need a DIFFERENT TYPE OF COFFEE (eg Loumidis papagalos greek coffee). This kind of coffee is made by adding coffee, sugar (if you want) and water in a tiny boiling pan (called ibrik) and slowly bring it to a boil until the coffee rises. Nescafe classico is a very nice coffee, but it's totally different than the traditional greek/turkish coffee.It can only be used for cold frappe or hot instant, NOT traditional greek coffee.

review/summary: Hard to stomach but it has its uses
review/text: When I lived in Greece in the Seventies, I insisted on drinking what the old people drank, namely Turkish coffee ("emeis to leme elleniko" - "we call it Greek" said a blurb on the package). However, Greek youth frequently spurned such stuff and drank instead the "frappes" made from the product you see here. To each their own. However, I've found a different use for it these latter days: I carry it on camping, and, especially, backpacking trips. Since it doesn't need, really, to be heated, there's no messing about with stoves and cleaning. How does it taste? Well, you can't have everything. But if you're addicted to coffee, and heat is unavailable or inconvenient, here's a product that might serve your purpose. Or perhaps prove that you're not the old-fashioned sort of Greek.

review/summary: Amazon's description is wrong
review/text: I really like Ahmad tea, but Amazon's description and picture of this item is wrong.  There is no Darjeeling tea in the six pack.  There is English Afternoon instead of Darjeeling.  While I like all of the teas in this variety pack, it really irks me when Amazon gets the description and picture wrong!  If you like bergamote you will like this variety pack.  The Earl Grey, English Afternoon, and English No.1 all have bergamote flavoring.  The English Afternoon and English No.1 seem to have less bergamote which is fine with me, because I don't like teas that have too much of it.

review/summary: A good, supermarket  shelf  romano
review/text: most of the romano you find at the supermarket is made from cows milk and of course, this is not romano.This product,while a little dusty in texture,is made froms sheeps milk,as all romano should be.That also means it does not contain the casein you get from cows milk and which clogs the arteries.The flavor(with some of the perservatives in it) is okay but not something to write home about; but it is decent and I would buy it again in a pinch.

review/summary: This cheese contains corn flour as a filler
review/text: It was very disappointing to read the ingredients and find that this cheese contains CORN FLOUR, which is a filler. Even grated cheese in supermarkets like Kraft label clearly "No Fillers". So does the Safeway brand. The thought of an Italian cheese having corn flour in it as a filler is repugnant to me, and is a rip off. Grated cheese should be 100% grated cheese. The label says that the corn flour is used to prevent caking. This is not true. Cellulose is used as an anti caking ingredient. Corn flour is a filler. This cheese tasted like saw dust to me and Amazon's excellent customer service gave me a full credit because I was so disappoined. Don't be fooled by the Italian name. Kraft grated cheese is 100% cheese and in a pinch is just fine and obviously sold in any supermarket.

review/summary: A true Romano cheese
review/text: For many years I used Locatelli Romano cheese, and truly enjoyed it. I still do, however the price is, and always has been, staggering. Several months ago I began using the DeLallo Romano brand cheese. I think that it would be unfair to compare it to the Locatelli as they are two very different, though same type of cheeses. I love the Locatelli's texture and consistancy, but I love the DeLallo's flavor. For the difference in price, I will continue buying and enjoying this cheese (DeLallo). For those who may be sceptical, try it, you may find as I did that you not only have a money saver, but a terrific alternative to high priced name brand cheese.

review/text: Grated Romano cheese has become so difficult to find in my area that, once again, I turned to Amazon to save the day.  This brand is a bit more salty and somewhat less "full" flavored than the Kraft Romano which I'm used to, but it's nonetheless tangy and delicious.  If I'm still unable to find a grated Romano locally by the time I polish off this case of DeLallo, I'll be happy to buy it again from Amazon.

While it delivers a great butter taste, the best part of using it is that it will not burn your food (like regular butter does). I use it for saut&eacute;ing chicken and vegetables. My favorite use of this product is for hashbrowns. It makes the potatoes nice and crisp without ever burning. Far superior to any oil or regular butter, you'll be hooked the first time you use it. Added bonus: extraordinary shelf life.

I just use a stick blender, puree the peppers and the adobo sauce into a paste and put it in a tightly sealed container in the fridge. It will keep for months. If you're like me, it won't last nearly that long. We find that few savory dishes aren't improved by a spoonful of chipotle.

review/text: These are definitely tasty and gingery cookies.  It turns out that I wasn't all that big on the idea of having a filled ginger cookie (I still prefer the plain ones), but it's nice to have options.  The thing about these which I disliked was the "break" or the feeling they have when you bite into them.  I found it a bit hard and brittle, which although normal for a ginger snap, didn't play off well in combination with a soft icing filling.  Not a big deal; just a slight annoyance to me.  I got around it by keeping them chilled, which helped to firm up the filling so the cookie wouldn't sort of smoosh as you bit into it.

review/summary: Strong coffees for serious java lovers
review/text: All of these blends land on the strong side.  The Newman's Blend and Green Mountain are the mildest of the lot.  The Caribou has a very bold flavor that is well suited to addition of milk or creme.  The Tully's french roast really screams for a cafe au lait blend, as it should.<br /><br />These all appear to be ground coffee in each pack with a paper filter.  This may seem obvious, except that some manufacturers are selling keurig cups with only instant coffee in them.  My personal favorite is the Newman's Own.  However, I also yearn for some milder blends for the morning.  Green Mountain makes a good breakfast blend.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good Keurig system, then I recommend the Cusinart system (also reviewed).  It has a large capacity reservoir and the ability to brew your own ground coffee, which is much more economical.  For instance, I like the Starbucks Breakfast Blend and/or Community Coffee.  The Cuisinart system does a great job for single cups of these products as well.<br /><br />In short, this is a good bold batch of coffees that will blend well with milk or cream.  They will also appeal to those that like a aromatic, flavorful cup after dinner.

If I find myself sitting on the knee of some fat bearded guy at the mall, telling him what I wish for most and whether I've been a naughty boy, then I've got a whole world of problems I really don't want to think about.<br /><br />Still, 'tis the season. So at my wife's insistence, I'm making an effort to find the "Christmas spirit" this year. Where by "find", of course I mean "buy".<br /><br />I agreed -- against my better judgement -- to sit down and have a holiday cup of eggnog with the family. That was before I remembered that Aunt Jackie is hardcore Hollywood vegan -- she won't eat anything that's ever had a line in an film. She lost fifteen pounds after Veggie Tales came out. I'm talking Hard. CORE.<br /><br />So I ended up buying this 'rice nog' instead. Which tastes just about you might think a recipe calling for eggs would taste, if you made it with rice instead. Ever try a rice omelet? Rices Benedict? Long grain over easy? Even Aunt Jackie wouldn't drink it -- and she thinks tofurkey is the caviar of veganarianist cuisine. Boy, was there rice on MY face after that.

review/summary: Perfect for dipping and much more
review/text: This set of spices is designed for mixing with olive oil and used for dipping. Most folks think it's strictly for bread, but it is also perfect as a seasoning over oil and vinegar with pinzimonio (raw vegetables such as bell peppers, cauliflower, celery, etc.)<br /><br />For bread, I keep it on hand for guests, along with a quality extra virgin olive oil, Since most of my guests are convinced that one must mix in balsamic vinegar, I also make sure I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CFO37Y">Gia Russa Balsamic Glaze</a> on hand (read my review of that product for the reason why I use it instead of so called balsamic vinegars such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00759NNKI">Balsamic Vinegar of Modena</a>.)  For the record, I consider mixing either of the balsamic products I just mentioned in high quality olive oil to be a crime because those products mask the nuances of the oil. But that is just me.<br /><br />Other uses I have for these dipping spices include: drizzle oil over indents in the dough, then grind the spices over it when making focaccia. Also, a few grinds over insalada Caprese, or even a fresh garden salad also works wonders, In fact, let your imagination run wild because these spices are fragrant and not overpowering.<br /><br />Be aware that there is sea salt in the mix, which means you need to be careful with respect to sodium if you or your guests have dietary restrictions. I always have a few of these around, both in my kitchen and on my table.

review/text: GoNaturally Organic Gluten Free Candy is really amazing candy.  It's not made with any corn syrups nor does it have any artificial coloring or added chemicals that I don't want to put in my body.  They taste heavenly and the company has really gone out of it's way to make a healthier alternative for your sweet tooth, while making it still taste phenomenal.  They are a huge hit in my office as well, and they fly out the door pretty quickly.  I have a throat affliction and my throat gets very dry at time, but these help keep my mouth moist without doing much damage to my teeth or my waistline.  The flavors are all really yummy, from the tart to the sweet, and everyone has a favorite.  I don't feel bad about giving these to my children either and they love them.  The Ginger candy they make is superb as well, if you like a lighter ginger flavor.  Great as an alternative to mints for freshening breath after a meal when you don't have anywhere to brush.  The company seems to have a good handle on what consumers want and they genuinely focus on making healthier sweet things for eco-conscious people and people with allergies.  Just wonderful.

review/text: This bag has a lot of candy, but the flavor choices are great! The Apple is juicy, not tart. The Pomegranate is tangy, the Cherry is on the sweet side, not too sour and the Honey Lemon is a great combination. Being organic is a plus!

review/summary: GoNaturally Organic candies
review/text: I ordered the GoNaturally Organic Assorted GF Candies.  They said I would get four flavors in this large bag.  Apple, Cherry, Pomegranate and Honey Lemon.  When I opened the bag instead of Honey Lemon, I got a lot of Honey and only 5 Honey Lemon (which was one of the reasons I ordered the assorted bag). Honey was not one of the four flavored in this bag. I don't know what happen in the packaging of my candy, but I was not happy when I opened the bag. That's why I gave it 3 stars. The candy taste good.

review/summary: Diabetic- good for a sweet snack
review/text: These are really good, and I'm looking forward to getting the 30 oz bag.  I've been a diabetic for 17 years, and am an RN.  I have recently recovered from chemo for leukemia, and am on the organic bandwagon, since the leukemia was actually caused by changes in my DNA- pretty scary. Considering all of the genetically modified (GMO) foods out there, that are not labeled (and our government sees no reason that we should know that information), I look for all of the organic, GMO free stuff I can find.<br /><br />I can't eat these like I could sugar-free candy, but they are nice for a quick hit of sweetness.<br /><br />GREAT flavors and taste !!

review/text: Wow, these things are fantastic.  The flavors are delicious.  No sour or tart flavors like Jolly Ranchers, but sweet fruit flavors.  Sad to say the Honey Lemons went fast (they were the best!) but the Cherry, Pomegranate, and Apple were also superb.  They are about 15 calories per piece.  The kids can't stop taking them from the candy bowl!  I know I'll be ordering these again, a much nicer candy choice.  You really can't go wrong with this assortment.  Enjoy!
