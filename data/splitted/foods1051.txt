review/summary: Fantastic grain free treats!!!
review/text: Considering the fact that these treats are grain-free, and have high quality ingredients, the price makes sense. You always pay more for better things, right? I love that these treats aren't full of things I cannot pronounce. They also don't have a bunch of things in it that make no sense to feed a dog (like sugar). These treats are also made in the USA, which is important to me. All in all, these are great treats. The dogs love them, and I can give them treats without feeling guilty, or worrying that they will get sick. Try them yourself, your dogs will love you for it.

review/summary: Ridiculous
review/text: I purchased this package of Milky Ways a few months ago and if I had written my review then I would have given it 4 stars. I paid $17.96 at the time. That came to $4.49 a bag and they are nice large bags. If it wasn't for the length of time it took to ship I would have given it 5 stars. Now it's more than doubled in price and comes to $9.00 a bag. I find that a ridiculous price and a very steep increase in such a short period of time. These bags are large but they are not that large. Do yourself a favor and buy them at Walmart or your grocery store.

review/summary: Simply Delish!!
review/text: I tried this sauce on a whim, when I saw it in Whole Foods Market. It had a local label and I'm all 'gung ho' for trying out products made locally. I wasn't sure what to expect so I tasted a little bit before mixing it with my other ingredients, and was initially surprised that it truly tasted like its name as well as very authentic. But boy was I surprised after I used this with a stuffed shells recipe and really tasted the flavors! The flavoring of the herbs in the sauce were simply robust and just delicious, complimenting my other ingredients extremely well. I vowed never to buy commercial pasta sauces ever again, but this certainly changed my mind. This is very close to making a sauce from scratch, in my opinion. If you're skeptical, I would suggest buying a jar from your local health food store before buying in bulk...you won't regret it!

review/text: This was indeed a nice genuine British Christmas pudding and the inclusion of a sixpence to add AFTER microwaving was a nice addition. The price of the pudding itself was fine, but I was miffed by the high shipping charge for a compact 8oz item, hence the reduction of one star. Still, it's only once a year and we enjoyed covering it in brandy, setting it aflame and then gorging ourselves...

review/text: I won't say that I know the real flavor difference between Hungarian Paprika brands.  What I can say is I purchased my first bottle of Hungarian Paprika from Williams and Sonoma.  While W&S paprika is tasty (IMO), their bottle only has 1.9 oz, while this can has 5 oz., more than twice the amount!  Like I said, I don't know how "authentic" the flavor is but this one was tasty when I made Paprikash.  I would buy this one again.

review/summary: My morning cup of freshness!
review/text: I've always heard about the very many benefits of Green Tea, but only got around to drinking it when I was down with the flu about 5 months ago and had a very sore throat. Unfortunately, the brand I picked up randomly <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376W6BK">Lipton Green Tea, 100% Natural, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> kept leaving a bitter after-taste in my mouth. It was one of those things I had to force myself to drink. So not fun.<br /><br />But then *drumroll* I found Bigelow Green Tea with Lemon! I loved it. It was as refreshing as it was soothing, all this without any unhealthy/artificial additions. Drinking this product frequently throughout the day worked wonders for my sore throat and health-o-meter, and converted me into a die-hard fan. My morning cuppa tea and quiet time is a prized part of my routine now. I heart this product, and oh yea, it's not that expensive either. I just pick up individual 20-ct boxes at Walmart for $2.04 every so often.<br /><br />By the way, here's the lazy person's three-step process of drinking this tea - Boil 1 cup of water in the microwave for about 1-2 minutes. Immediately drop in the teabag and let steep for 3-5 minutes. Enjoy your lovely cup of freshness.

review/summary: A major tea-drinker's perspective
review/text: I have been drinking tea since I was old enough to steal my mother's mug for a sip of orange pekoe, which is close to 30 years ago now.<br />This tea is light, refreshing, and natural-tasting in the best way possible. It kicks the butt of Celestial Seasonings, which I stopped drinking since switching to this brand full-time. I like the distinctive flavor, the healthiness of the green tea, and that if it were a blind taste test I could still tell you which one this one was with a sip, or a smell of the yummy aroma. I hope they always make this tea, because it is worth keeping a case around, knowing it will never go to waste or be forgotten in the back shelf. You will drink every box of this tea and come back for more. I drop two bags in a large mug of hot water, and steep it 3 minutes, no more, no less. Never boil the water, it messes with the flavor. I once brought a mug of this to my trusting husband and he took one nip of it and gave me a serious look, "Damn, this is good tea!" I already knew it was, but it is always nice to hear someone else say it, too.<br />If you buy it on amazon subscription (I also have prime, which is a bonus) you will get a respectable price, which doesn't exceed the store cost. I don't even have to go to the store to get this, and it arrives in a cardboard case I can pop on the shelf. It doesn't stay there long, though, since I adore this tea immensely.

review/text: If you're looking for a tasty green tea, you might enjoy this Bigelow green tea with lemon.  I love the flavor of lemon in tea.  This has a light, pleasant lemony flavor which isn't overpowering. The tea is a wonderful afternoon or evening treat.  Green tea alone to me tastes the way hay smells--excuse me, we used to have a horse form and when I drink plain green tea I feel like I'm drinking horses brew.<br /><br />But this tea tastes like lemon and is delightful.  I was never a tea drinker but wanted to add green tea to all the other nutritious foods I'm eating and this is my favorite so far.  I want to try the decaf version of this green tea with lemon, also.<br /><br />Each tea bag comes individually wrapped with a string so the bag is easy for dipping. If you like lemon flavored tea, you should enjoy this version of it.

review/text: To put it simply, this is the most HORRIBLE cake product on the market. I wanted so badly for it to be great. Being an avid searcher for delicious fat-free or low-fat dessert alternatives, this sounded like the absolute MOTHER LOAD!<br />Normally when you open a cake mix box, you get that delightful cake smell that we are all too familiar with... this is not the case with this product. In fact, the product had an almost chalky smell to it. After mixing it with the water, the mix took on a paste smell and after baking there was still no sign that this was supposed to be a dessert. Now I'm stuck with 5 other packs that I have no clue what I'll do with.<br />If you are hungry for a fat free treat, my suggestion would be to go with "No Pudge Brownies" and SKIP this horrible excuse for a dessert.

review/text: I'd rather eat this canned tuna than any fresh fish that wasn't just pulled out of the water!  It's addictive...  And it makes regular grocery store brands of tuna taste like cat food.  Dry cat food.  This is well worth the price.  Try it tossed, oil and all, with hot pasta, a little lemon and some pepper for a super-quick and tasty meal.

review/summary: Remarkably delicious tuna in a handy little can
review/text: And the can even has a pull ring! This is a no-brainer busy-day lunch. And the tuna is DELICIOUS!!! I was expecting a lot of olive oil, you know, so much that I'd have to drain it like water-packed tuna and that wasn't the case at all; if anything I'd say the tuna was lightly DRESSED with olive oil. And just the right amount of salt. Incredibly convenient. I never want to be without a stack of this tuna in the pantry. I had no idea such delicious tuna existed.

review/summary: Great choice for Tuna lovers
review/text: My husband and I both LOVE this tuna. It's hard to find the small cans in the grocery stores and when you do it's very expensive.  Purchasing the case was a great cost savings and convenient to have it on hand when we want it.  I keep several cans at work and add it to a home made or purchaed salad for a healthy and tasty lunch.  One can is the perfect amount of protein for a single serving.  This Italian style tuna is delicious and has more flavor and better texture than the usual solid white tuna packed in water.  I just drain a little of the oil off and add it to my salad for a quick, healthy and tasty meal.

review/summary: Fine tuna, deja vu all over again
review/text: Funny about the rave reviews here, don't get me wrong the tuna is indeed top-notch, but what amuses me is that this is simply as good as tuna used to be in this country. Starkist, Chicken of the Sea, all the major brands used to have such quality tuna in oil (MAYBE NOT olive but still tasty) as the only choice available. Then came the novelty geared towards dieters, tuna in water, then the oil-based variety was eased out I guess entirely. So now we who like good tuna have to find it from Italy. America in decline--

review/text: Thanks to all the previous reviewers -- this is indeed delicious tuna:  delicate flavor, excellent texture, with a hint of olive oil (not heavy and cloying). It is a bit salty, which I enjoy.  I ordered the 3-ounce cans in the 24 pack and find the size perfect for a sandwich or to eat right out of the can...yes, it's that good.<br /><br />To my taste buds,Tonnino Tuna Ventresca in Olive Oil is slightly better -- but only slightly -- not enough to justify the higher price.  Both are much better than supermarket-bought canned tuna.<br /><br />Ordered it from Amazon Prime and, of course, it was delivered promptly and in good condition.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Not a vegetarian, but prefer this jello over regular jello
review/text: I ordered a 24 pack and was given extra to share and a nice handwritten note from the company, very nice.<br /><br />I really like the jello. I bought it originally to make homemade gummy candy, but it just did not get to like the store bought - which does not reflect on this product. I just didn't do it right. Anyhow, I make it as the direction on the package says and sometimes I will add a bit of agar agar to make it firmer. I pour it into the candy molds such as frogs, bears, and my kids love it. All the flavors are really good and the texture is nice, clean tasting.<br /><br />While it is a better alternative to the conventional Jello made with animal gelatin, it still does have artificial coloring. But 'organic' colorings usually involve some animal derivative. Will order again.

review/text: We ordered, and it was delivered promptly and with 25% more product than we ordered "to share." That was cool.<br /><br />The product itself is just like Jello, and once we got past the fact that green does not mean Lime, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The flavors are a little less intense, but much more "natural" tasting then the fakey Jello. And having a vegetarian in the family (and all of us being grossed out by what is in regular Jello), it is an awesome alternative.<br /><br />Will definitely order again!

review/summary: Better than the dry packets and a great 3-way!
review/text: This is called Cincinnati Chili because it originated there but is a fine minced ground beef with spices that are different than normal Texas chili; this chili is flavored with cinnamon, cumin, cloves and chocolate.  It's different but a cult favorite in the midwest.  The traditional method of serving is called a 3-way where you pour the chili over cooked spaghetti and cover in finely shredded cheddar cheese.  There is also a 4-way which includes either adding light red kidney beans or chopped white onions.  The 5-way is adding both beans and onions.  Often hot sauce is used along with oyster crackers.  The other favorite is a cheese coney where you take a traditional hot dog and then pour the chili over top adding the shredded cheddar cheese with mustard and/or onions.  You can make this chili from scratch getting a recipe from allrecipes or you can use the dry packet mix <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B6O4LO">6 Pack Cincinnati Chili</a> but either way is not the same.  You just can't get the ground beef minced enough to resemble the true stuff.<br />This is also a great gift to send to any troop overseas who is from the midwest.  They would instantly know and love your package.  Facebook even has pages committed to this chili.  It's a cult favorite and you will either love it or hate it.

review/summary: If your desperate for a three way this is the ticket!
review/text: Cincinnatians all know the story of Skyine, created by Nicholas Lambrinides, a Greek immigrant.  The recipe is different than the standard chile favored by Americans because it has spices such as cinnamon and cloves.  Of course out of a can, it is not the same as in the restaurant (I still favor the one off Oakley Square when I go back to Cincinnati).  The frozen doesn't ship well so we are left with the canned as our only choice if there is  no franchise nearby.<br /><br />My main problem with the canned chili is it is too watery.  Either cook it down a bit or strain before serving.<br /><br />Here are the typical recipes:<br /><br />Pour chili over a plate of freshly cooked spaghetti.  Add a VERY generous amount of shredded cheddar cheese (mild is favored).  This is a three way.  For a four way, add diced oniions.  Five way?  Red kidney beans.<br /><br />Take a hot dog bun and apply yellow mustard.  Use a good quality beef hot dog.  Pour chili over it, sprinkle some diced onions and add a VERY generous amount of shredded chedda.  This is the cheese coney.<br /><br />Finally my son just likes chili cheese fries, with fries, Skyline and lots of cheddar cheese.<br /><br />Not for the faint of heart, or those with hardening of the arteries, this is a little taste of cincinnati.

review/summary: A little strange
review/text: I got this out of curiosity...I had never even heard of Cincinnati chili except at some American restaurant in Shanghai, and so the next time I was in the US I wanted to try the (semi) real thing.<br /><br />I dig this stuff, but it's not what your normally think of, when you think of chili...the main differences being, it's much thinner, more like a sauce with a lot of beef in it.  There's no tomato sauce.  And it's not hot - the spices are a more subdued mix, the most prominent (to me) being allspice, and then cinnamon.<br /><br />It's too thin to stand on its own, so I have it with hot dogs, and the norm is to put it on spaghetti.  Probably any starchy food would work fine, though.  Trans-fat has been (perhaps correctly) demonized lately, so it's a little weird that each can has a couple grams.  It's not much, but you think they'd get rid of it.<br /><br />Anyway of course canned chili isn't the height of the culinary world, but it's about as good as any other canned chili I've had.

review/summary: A Cincinnati favorite, but an acquired taste
review/text: I did not like Skyline Chili the first time I had it. I was introduced to it by a friend who made me a "four-way" (chili, spaghetti, cheese, and beans). I am not a fan of beans. I tried it a second time to make sure the first time wasn't a fluke--this time without the beans and enjoyed it very much so that I am now a fan.<br /><br />It definitely has a unique taste to it, it could be the chocolate. The consistently is not thick like other types of chili, and you put it on top of spaghetti, along with a mountain of cheese which is very weird at first. Give it a couple of chances and you just might like it; I make no guarantees, this is an acquired taste. (TIP: Try it with EXTRA SHARP cheddar shredding for the best kick in flavor.)<br /><br />When I saw this 6-pack on Amazon I ordered it right away! It beats the prices from other sites and you don't have to go all the way to Cincinnati or ask your Cincy friends to get you some. Don't forget to dine in at the Skyline Chili restaurants whenever you're in Cincinnati for the most authentic taste!

review/text: This is some fantastic stuff right here.  But be forewarned, this is not your normal tex-mex style chili.  This chili is thin, and has ingredients like cinnamon in it.  I know must people that I have told about this chili, upon their first taste, have not known how to think about it.  I normally get "its different".  But after the second and third times, they have all bought their own cans and love it now.<br /><br />The best way to eat this is in the classic three-way style.  Take some spaghetti and place it on a plate. Add the chili on top of the pasta and add a nice helping of shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Enjoy a four or five way by either adding beans or sliced onions, or both!<br /><br />Top a good natural casing hot dog with the chili, a little mustard and the cheddar cheese and you have one heck of a chili dog.<br /><br />Im getting hungry now after writing this, and I think I am going to go make some Skyline!

review/summary: Great for those who don't have a Skyline nearby.
review/text: Great price for the chili compared to ordering it directly from Skyline's site (under $3.00/can from Amazon including shipping).  However, the packaging of the product was horrible and about 1/3 of the cans arrived dented from bouncing around in the much too large box they were shipped in.  I rate the product at five stars, but I have to take away a star due to the packaging.

review/summary: An Epic Disappointment
review/text: I read about the taste of Skyline chili on a Tulsa, OK website [..], posted by someone trying to simulate the unique taste of cheese coneys made by the Tulsa, OK-based Coney Islander hot dog restaurant chain.<br /><br />A transplanted Tulsa native that's lived in New York City since 1977, I was suddenly overpowered by the urge to recreate the mythic hot dogs of my teenage youth, so I immediately ordered a case of six 15-ounce cans.<br /><br />Amazon promptly delivered the chili and I eagerly set about sampling it. Unfortunately the chili turned out to be (no disrespect intended to Skyline fans in Cincinnati and elsewhere) inedible--at least to my taste buds--and looking nothing like the product depicted on the can wrapper. The contents consisted of half watery soup, half highly spiced meat, and resembling nothing like the savory, meaty chili described by the website writer. Even after pouring off all the liquid, the remaining chili was so heavily spiced with I believe to be a heavy dose of cloves and perhaps some cinnamon and other ingredients that I stopped eating after a single bite.<br /><br />Still, wanting to believe that I could somehow employ this chili to help mimic the taste of my beloved Coney Islander cheese dogs, I asked my wife to sample the chili, who proclaimed it to be "awful."<br /><br />Much as I hate to step on a product that some people no doubt love, I have to say this is the absolute worst canned chili I've ever eaten. It was so bad I felt slightly nauseated a few minutes after having the single bite, and a faint worry about food poisoning briefly entered my mind.<br /><br />Needless to say, the five other cans were summarily tossed into the garbage. The quest to find the perfect chili for hot dogs continues...

review/text: Sorry, but it must be an acquired taste.  It was more like soup than chili...could barely find the meat.  Plus, it tasted like it was loaded with ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and something else.  Those things have no business being in chili.  It was so overwhelming I literally couldn't taste any other food for 15 minutes after eating it, almost like it ruined my taste buds.

review/summary: A convenient, quality product
review/text: I was quite surprised with the quality of this product.  I wasn't expecting too much from canned beef, but this is very tasty.  The beef chunks are in a nice, fairly thick gravy and it works well in many dishes including just pouring over rice or mashed potatoes for a simple meal. The texture of the meat is very good--it reminds me of crock pot cooked beef stew.  It's a real time saver and I keep several cans on hand.

review/text: Pros:<br />+Really tasty, especially if you have a little gravy mix on hand to thicken it.<br />+Long shelf life.<br />+Great time saver, goes great on just about anything.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Amount of beef. They really didn't hold back with the gravy in these. The beef still tastes great, but there isn't much of it.<br />-Quality of the beef. This one's a little biased, as I grew up on Libby's where the beef had a much more solid, wholesome bite to it and that's what I was expecting when I grabbed these.<br /><br />All in all, still a great meal when you're short on time and still want something that tastes good. If they upped the amount of beef in the cans and thickened the gravy a bit I'd love to come back and give this 5 stars.

review/summary: A quality, versatile, and delicious product--I'm a permanent fan!
review/text: I've been looking for more choices that give me at least a partial "made-at-home" taste with minimum work.  Sometimes I come home from work and I am so tired that I don't want to cook much of anything - - but I also want something other than take-out, canned soup, or a frozen dinner.  After seeing the reviews for this product, I ordered it.  I figured that it would be average, but I was willing to take the chance because the price was low and the nutrition information showed this to be a healthy choice.<br /><br />To my pleasant surprise, it is everything the other reviews suggested and more!  I came home, threw a couple of potatoes in the microwave, and emptied the roast beef into a bowl.  I ended up with the beef and gravy over lightly buttered baked potatoes.  It was a hearty and filling meal (enough for two dinners) that tasted like a good crock pot roast.  I've since tried the product in stroganoff and creamed over toast points.  Both were fantasatic!  The meat is hearty, lean, and tender; the gravy is flavorful and rich.  Honestly, I'm amazed that something so good is such a secret - - but then again, any canned beef I've tried before this product has tasted (and smelled!) like dog food.<br /><br />Bottom line: THIS IS A FANTASTIC PRODUCT!  It is delicious, convenient, versatile, and thoroughly enjoyable.  What a blessing!

review/summary: Tacos, Burritos, Oh My!!
review/text: Please think 'out of the box' for this product. I have used it for over 20 years for meat in tacos, burritos, added to BBQ sauce for 'pulled beef' sandwiches and other mostly ethnic dishes. I used to make my own tamales and used this meat for them.  I drain off the gravy most of the time and my doggies love it: if I keep it, I spice it up. We live in an area of the country where we may be out of power for days, and this is a great source of meals cooked on my Coleman stove.  All you need is canned salsa, canned refried beans, this meat, and tortillas.

review/summary: Pot Roast and Gravy
review/text: I subscribed to this as a replacement for beef stew that Amazon discontinued. The beef stew came with token vegetables, potatoes, lots of gravy and some cubes made of textured beef product. It wasn't too bad when doctored with red wine, spices, extra vegetables, and brown rice.<br /><br />There are no potatoes, or token vegetables here, and the textured beef cubes have been replaced with actual chunks of beef with the Libby roast beef. The chunks are slightly tough, have a pronounced grain, and actually taste something like beef. Having gone through six cans, I have found very little excess fat or gristle.<br /><br />It's pretty easy to whip up a quickie beef stew with this stuff. Frozen veggies, rice or potatoes, a can of diced or stewed tomatoes, some spices and wine, and you have a perfectly serviceable, quickie meal.<br /><br />For those who argue that made from scratch tastes better, you are right. For those who argue that home made is just as easy, well, I have a bridge I can sell you ... ;)

Its mostly corn and mystery meats, but it has so much stuff added to make the dog like it that they become quite picky afterwards. This stuff is like human fast food. It's hard to feed them human grade dog food after they're given this stuff. Now, my dog spits out the all-natural kibble -which I assume he thinks tastes like cardboard after having his taste buds desensitized by all the salt. Kinda like a Pandora's box.<br /><br />The stool is softened soft serve ice cream consistency. After first week when he became accustomed to it, which was more runny.<br /><br />The price is good, but your dog will become more picky with blander foods afterwards.

This just adds a nice portability to fresh dog food and I do mean it came fresh. I have bought this same brand at the store before and it was not fresh plus I paidd a higher price per can.  Boy that was disappointing.  But now I will always order her food this way.  I hope to add the cats food next time.

review/text: I like having delivered w/free shipping! There are two flavors per shipment. I think Pedigree is a good name and my dogs love it. So convenient - I don't even like going out to shop anymore!

review/text: I use pedigree products and I am quiet satisfied with them.  I have used other products Diamond Naturals and Halo etc...  Which are good as well, but more expensive.  I have very strong dogs and they both enjoy pedigree dry and the meat varieties.
