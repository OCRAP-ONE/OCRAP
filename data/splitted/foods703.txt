review/summary: Pomegranate Izze Cans Don't Measure Up to Izze in Bottles.
review/text: Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is one of my favorite fruit sodas, and I'm rarely without a few bottles in the house. When I ordered the Sparking Pomegranate in cans, I expected it to be a very similar product. Izze sparking juices in cans are called "Izze Fortified", because, unlike the bottled drinks, they are fortified with vitamins C (6 mg), B6 (0.2 mg), and Niacin (2 mg). That's 10% of the USRDA for those vitamins, an insignificant amount. But I wondered if the addition of vitamins would change the taste or if the aluminum can would impart a minerally flavor.<br /><br />I'm not sure what changed the taste, to tell the truth. Apart from the vitamins, the ingredients are the same as in bottled Izze. The vitamin C is in the form of ascorbic acid, but too scant to affect flavor. I'm not fond of very sweet things, so I love the sweet-tart taste of pomegranate. Izze Sparkling Pomegranate is the best pomegranate soda that I've tasted, because it tastes more like fresh pomegranate than pomegranate juice. The Izze Fortified Sparkling Pomegranate goes beyond tart into bitter, however, and it's not nearly as carbonated as the Izze in bottles. This is more of a slightly sparkling juice than a fruit soda.<br /><br />It may be that the sweeter flavors of Izze fare better in cans. I suspect that the reduced carbonation is concentrating the pomegranate flavor to poor effect. This stuff tastes flat to me as well as bitter. Sparkling Grapefruit is another tart favorite, so I don't think I'll try that in cans either. These are small 8.4 oz cans that are easy for someone with small hands to grasp but hold significantly less beverage than a traditional 12 oz drink can. They would be great for the pool or beach, where glass bottles are prohibited, if only the contents tasted better. If you're an Izze fan, stick with the bottles. The Izze Fortified just isn't refreshing in pomegranate.

review/summary: Good taste in the beginning, wears down quick
review/text: I haven't tried the bottled version that the most critical review says it tastes better; but when it first arrived I loved the taste, tasted true like the real pomegranate but I'm on my say, 10th or 12th can now in 3-4 weeks (I'm not over-drinking it) and it tastes more like cough syrup or has a medicinal taste; maybe I now taste all the added fortified vitamins etc... anyway, this will be my last purchase of this product.

review/summary: Absolutely delicious and refreshing.
review/text: Izze is one of my favorite drinks. When I cut sodas out of my diet, I looked for something to replace them. Ultimately, I ended up drinking a lot of sparkling water. But when I need something a little sweeter, I found these and I adore them. It's real fruit juice and sparking water so it still has sugars in it - just not added/refined sugar. So it's a lot better for you and a lot fewer calories than downing a coke.<br /><br />I do have a couple of very minor complaints (but they're so minor, the product still gets 5 stars from me). I feel like the drink could actually have a little less juice and a little more sparkling water. Sometimes it's just a little too sweet for me. Also, these cans are a little small (smaller than a normal can of soda). However, I've found a really easy way around both of these. I pour the can into a glass and top it off with some plain sparking water. Perfect!<br /><br />All the flavors are good, but pomegranate is my favorite (however, I'm a huge fan of just about anything pomegranate).

review/summary: Italian soda in a can
review/text: Izze is like a freshly made italian soda, but with the convenience of being in a can. It's not super-sugary like a normal fruit-flavored pop and it has a lighter fizz (just the right amount, if you ask me). I tried the Pomegranate flavor, which I would describe more as a tart cherry/pomegranate blend. It has quickly become my beverage of choice when I open up the fridge. It's definitely more of a sparkling fruit juice than what you would think of as "pop". I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Izze Leaves Lily A Little Underwhelmed
review/text: I live and work in Boulder, Colorado where Izze is headquartered and the product is available almost everywhere here and even sold in the school where I teach. So I've had the chance to try most of the flavors over the last few years. While I appreciate that Izze "stays true to the fruit" as their slogan says and is "refined" sugar(though it still has 19 grams of sugar per serving) caffeine and preservative free I just don't really care for the taste and would prefer to drink regular fruit juice or water if I'm being virtuous or diet soda if I'm walking on the wild side.  I do especially like pomegranate juice so in trying this flavor I thought maybe I'd finally found the right Izze for me.  Yet the bottom line is I still prefer my juice without "sparkling" water.  I should note that the 70% fruit juice content of Izze Pomegranate also includes apple, white grape, cranberry, lemon and pineapple juices and though pomegranate may be the smallest per cent of the juices it definitely is the dominant flavor.

review/summary: The Good Stuff
review/text: It's often the simplest ideas that work the best. These Izze beverages aren't complicated at all - they're 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water - but they sure taste great. I enjoy pomegranate juice, but I never go through enough to make buying the jugs they sell at the supermarket worthwhile. That's where these Izze single-serving cans come in handy.<br /><br />The good: The 8 ounce can is a reasonable serving size, it only has 80 calories, there isn't any caffeine or added sugar, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bad: I was expecting a bit more carbonation. Still, that's a minor complaint.<br /><br />The best: This juice makes a great mixer for your favorite adult beverage. I prefer it with vodka, but I imagine it would work fairly well with gin too.<br /><br />The verdict: Order a case! So far I've only tried the pomegranate juice, but I'll definitely be ordering more in the future.

review/text: So far, I've tried the Pomegranate and the Blackberry.  Both are good, but I like the Pomegranate the best.<br /><br />This stuff is best served chilled or over ice.  Straight out of the can at room temperature, it has a sort of bitter/metallic after-taste but chilling seems to eliminate it.  I like the fact that it has no added sugar, preservatives, or caffeine.  It's a refreshing change from the usual carbonated stuff.

review/summary: Yum, yum, yum....and more yum!
review/text: I remember when Izze was first introduced a few years back. I had it in Chicago and I immediately fell in love with it. The great packaging and the great taste made me consider it the gourmet version of sparkling water. Now they have done it again ?!  it is hard to believe that anyone can make something great even better, but they did it!<br /><br />The new fortified version is so refreshing that you can drink can after can and not get tired of it. My kids loved it, my girlfriend loved it, my mom loved it. This was a hit at our house. I wish that I had a chance to try the other flavors this was so good. Izze undeniably has a winner on their hands.

review/summary: Not Too Shabby
review/text: Izze's Pomegranate Sparkling Juice tastes great.  The cans are a bit smaller(8.4 oz)than your usual soda can(12 oz).  The pomegranate flavor is there, but there's another fruity flavor in there somewhere that I just can't really identify.  The drinks are good but from the can it looks as if it would some sort of "health drink".  I got the impression that this would be a low-to-no calorie beverage but each little can packs a pretty decent 80 calories.  So, if you are counting calories, Izze's might not be for you.  Otherwise, they are pretty good.

review/summary: Refreshing and Distinctive
review/text: Want a little sparkle in your glass?  Izze Sparkling Juice is the answer to a splash of fun in your summer cocktails and mocktails.<br /><br />I tried this straight, with twists of lemon and lime, and with vodka.  It is refreshing as an iced beverage all on its own.<br /><br />Which made me curious...if this is a distinctive sparkling pomegranate juice, how will it combine with Tanqueray, an aromatic gin?  (This is all in the name of research...)  It was a no contest win for Izze, as the flavors mixed well together, and my guests enjoyed a refreshing cocktail.<br /><br />I also like the size...slender enough to be stacked in our fridge or thrown into a picnic basket.  This is a versatile drink that is refreshing and fun.  It is sure to be a regular in our fridge.

review/summary: Refreshing and not too sweet
review/text: Pomegranate and Grapefruit<br /><br />Izze sodas are refreshing and not overly sweet.  There calorie content is almost identical to regular soda but because they have a natural tartness, they don't taste as sweet.  So this is not a way to reduce your caloric intake except that the cans are smaller than regular soda cans.  With 70% fruit juice you might expect that Izze sodas would have more Vitamin C but the fruit juices used in Izze are mostly grape and apple.  For the pomegranate flavor, pomegranate is the 6th fruit juice listed.<br /><br />So why drink Izze?  The main reason is that it a tasty change from colas.  There are many flavors and you are sure to find one that you like.

review/summary: Refreshing and guilt-free
review/text: This is a really nice product for those who want to consume healthful things. Refreshing, tasty and guiltless beverages are too few and far between these days, but this qualifies.<br /><br />Far too many "vitamin drinks" on the shelf are packed with empty calories, high-fructose corn syrup, and no actual fruit juice (or anything else good for you, for that matter). This is a refreshing exception.<br /><br />The pros: 70% juice, not overly calorie-ridden, the Izze drinks DO contain a bit of Vitamins C, B6 and Niacin, but do NOT contain any dreaded (and seemingly ubiquitous) high-fructose corn syrup (about which I have heard nothing good. Not one thing), and it tastes really good.<br /><br />The cons: Okay, not so much a con perhaps, but one should be aware that the product contains no more than 10% of the RDA of any of the aforementioned vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />So as long as you don't think of it as a magic health elixir, but rather as a great-tasting, refreshing drink that appears to contain nothing bad for you, I think you will enjoy this drink as much as I have.

review/summary: Izze flavors are actually a mix of different juices, pom tasted like cranberry but grapefruit was better.
review/text: Izze is a great concept, especially as this is one soda that is actually a little healthier than the usual carbonated beverages. I ordered the Pomegranate and Grapefruit and preferred the latter much more.<br /><br />Pomegranate: I love Pomegranate juices like Pom and other organic alternatives available [...] as it is a very heart healthy drink. However, despite my liking for the tart taste, the Izze pomegranate juice in cans has a slightly bitter after taste and does not taste as good as real pomegranate juice. It may be due to the dilution or just because this pomegranate juice is "adulterated" with more cranberry juice than pomegranate! It does state on the can that it is a mixture of several juices like grape, pineapple, cranberry. However, since the can said pomegranate I was expecting the juice to be primarily pomegranate and I feel slightly cheated if I taste more cranberry. It would be nice to see more information on the can about the proportion of pomegranate juice in this juice mix.<br /><br />Since I found this juice to be a little too bitter, I tried making a "Pom-cosmo-tini", essentially a Cosmopolitan using Izze Pom and it turned out quite delicious. Now I know where the rest of the case is going, time to throw a party!<br /><br />Grapefruit: This one tasted a whole lot better and has none of the bitter after taste of the Pomegranate. It tastes more like real grapefruit although this is also a mix of several juices.<br /><br />In a taste test, I asked my friends to try the Pom and the Grapefruit. Everyone was excited to see the stylishly slim can but no one liked the Pom flavor. In fact one person said it tasted like cough syrup and poured it down the sink. My daughter also rejected the Pomegranate after one sip and finished half the grapefruit can. I was hoping she'd like Izze a bit more so I could give her some to drink at school, I believe the Apple and the Blackberry flavors are sweeter so I'll try those next.

review/summary: Delicious and Refreshing
review/text: Wow.  That was the first thing that came to mind when I opened one of these and tried it.  Not only was it delicious and thirst-quenching, but it was also good for me and didn't come loaded down with sugars.  I was very impressed at both the flavor and the content.<br /><br />So many beverages nowadays are just loaded with sugar and other artificial flavorings.  Then we wonder why we are getting so overweight in this country.  Izze has turned the tables on all that and uses only the natural sweetness of the fruits to sweeten up the drinks.  At 80 calories a pop, those 80 calories are actually something good for your body and not just junk calories!<br /><br />I noticed after I drink one that my thirst quickly goes away.  Again, this comes back to the fact they aren't loading the drink down with sugar.  It is a great after-workout drink because it really does help quench that deep-down thirst.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about the small size, but you soon find out that they are just perfect for one serving.  Instead of tempting you to overindulge like most soft drinks, this one actually gives you ONE serving and ONE serving only.<br /><br />A great product and one that is good for you -- how can you go wrong?

review/summary: Tarty juice drink, great for the summer.
review/text: I refrigerated the cans as soon as they arrived as I prefer chilled juice beverages. Upon opening the can, I noticed a release of gas. The details on the can indicate there is sparkling water, aka carbonated water much like soda. Rather than being a pure pomegranate juice drink, there is a mix of other juices: apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry, and pomegranate. I could easily detect the cranberry and apple, followed by grape and lemon. The pineapple and pomegranate was extremely subtle. The drink is far from being sweet and tastes much like apple/cranberry juice. My only complaint is that the cans are rather small. If they were 12 ounce cans or of larger volume, I would have enjoyed it for a longer period of time. The Izze Pomegranate juice is advertised to not contain any refined sugars, caffeine, or preservatives. Overall, this is the perfect chilled beverage for relaxing outside during the summer.

review/text: We rarely have soda in our house.

It has no refined sugar and most importantly no high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />The can is an 8.4 oz. size, smaller then your normal soda but really a perfect size in my opinion. It got a thumbs up all around.<br /><br />The pomegranate flavor was tangy, not too sweet and delicious.

review/summary: Original owners had a great cause and purpose.
review/text: INITIAL THOUGHTS:<br /><br />I like the idea of creating a drink that is true to the fruit's taste.  If you ate a fresh fruit, you would have an idea of what IZZE drinks would taste like.  This is a good thing, of course.  But in order to appreciate the drink, you will have to re-orient your taste if you've been drinking the over-sweetened fruit drinks.<br /><br />In a market saturated with energy drinks full of caffeine and artificial sweeteners, the company chose to go the other way to create a naturally sweet drink with no refined sugars, no caffeine and no preservatives.<br /><br />THE PRODUCT:<br /><br />For 2008 the company, which is now under PepsiCo, introduces the IZZE Fortified which contains 10% of the USRDA Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Niacin.  And this is what is being reviewed.<br /><br />I don't know if this the fortification will make a dent towards a healthier drink compared with other fortified drinks in the market.  I guess if you couple this with the fact that it contains 70% fruit juice and is low in sodium then people who are looking for something else other than water will perhaps have a reason to want to drink this than go the soda route.<br /><br />The remaining 30% is seltzer water which can be a good alternative and a great way for adults and children to slowly steer away from the usual carbonated drinks.  Although with Pepsi at the marketing wheel, it is interesting to see how they position this product with the rest of their soda line up.  (They did say they will leave the product alone, but this is a relatively young acquisition so let's not think for a moment that the product has settled in already when it's actually just beginning.)<br /><br />TASTE:<br /><br />They have geared the drink toward a more natural taste.  So if you are used to sweetened juices, be wary and try a single sample of each flavors than a whole bulk at once.  Because the pomegranate taste you may come to know may not actually be the same taste you expect with this product.  This company is not shy in making you taste the tartness or sourness when present in a fruit.<br /><br />To compare my taste buds with others, I made my colleagues try the "Sparkling Pomegranate" and I got adverse reactions on the flavor.  The thing is these are people who are soda drinkers.  So they may not be the correct target market for this kinds of healthy-tasting drinks.  But then again the manufacturers need to lure these people as well if they want to expand their market.<br /><br />That's why it's interesting to see how PepsiCo will market this product in full force and convince the general soda drinkers to appreciate the taste.<br /><br />Although for a product that tries to stick to the natural fruit taste, it would be perplexing to me when the first ingredient found in a drink called "Sparkling Pomegranate" would be "pure juice made from Apple"...which goes on to list in this order "White Grape. Clarified Pineapple, Lemon, Cranberry and Pomegranate."  Finally, Pomegranate is mentioned albeit at the end!<br /><br />SIZE:<br /><br />8.4 FL OZ is too little these days.  Although consuming this liquid in sparkling form will help you drink more slowly than if it were in the usual flat juice experience.<br /><br />I guess it's perfect for children since they are starting to sell this in schools as well.  But what about adults who have been trained to take on big drinks.  The size may be perfect if used alongside their meal, but what about in between meals?  I guess it's about time we are redirected in our thinking that if we are thirsty, then we drink water.  Unlike other products that advertises in quenching your thirst, this is not where it's heading.<br /><br />SO WHERE IS THIS PRODUCT HEADING?<br /><br />I can only surmise with the acquired taste and small size of this product, it will remain a niche product in a campaign toward healthier consumption.  In fact part of the image is being involved in a charity program that centers on needy children around the world.<br /><br />I would love to have them exist for a good cause, but I honestly won't go out and buy a product and force myself to like the taste so I can help educate the children.  If I wanted to do that then I'll simply find a non-profit organization that prides itself in maximizing contributions toward going to children than towards the running cost.<br /><br />In any case, I am not faulting the product for anything.  It's a product that certainly appeals to me and hopefully others who want a healthier option and know that water is their main source in quenching their daily thirst, but want something exciting in between.<br /><br />So three (3) starts because it's not a revolutionary product at this day and age, but at least it's something to consider.

review/summary: Free of high-fructose
review/text: I like soda. I definitely drink too much of it, but it's one of the last I-know-how-bad-it-is-for-me things I allow myself in a time when most of the foods and drinks you see in the supermarket can best be described as "mild poison." Books and documentaries keep popping up telling us just how bad the foods are that we consume (Supersize Me, Fast Food Nation, The Omnivore's Dilemma, etc.), and one of the big offenders is the insidious high fructose corn syrup. They put it in everything, it seems, especially beverages. (Its worst aspect is that it blocks the receptors in your brain that tell you you're full and should stop eating or drinking, so you continue feeling hungry and eating and drinking more and more.) So it's refreshing to have a drink that's got a nice sweet flavor without this awful sweetener. Tastes will vary, but I found this pretty nice, and pomegranate's a flavor you don't normally see as a soda - or, "sparkling juice" - so I'd say this is worth a try. At the very least, it's more interesting than another boring ol' cola or lemon-lime soft drink.<br /><br />A note on the Clementine variety:<br />These Izze drinks are really quite nice. In addition to the lack of high fructose corn syrup, which is a major plus, they use really interesting flavors. This clementine flavored sparkling juice is cool variation. I thought it might taste more like a Sunkist-style orange soda, but it really doesn't. The clementine flavor is very distinctive. I don't think I've ever had a soda quite like it. Tastes great, very tangy, not nearly as sweet as I would have expected. A nice, cool drink for the spring.<br /><br />A note on the Grapefruit variety:<br />Much the same as the others, this is a nice change of pace for a fizzy drink. This is my wife's favorite flavor, though for me it's got a little less zest than I would have expected. Still, it fits nicely with the other flavors.

review/summary: IZZE is great!
review/text: My husband fell in love with the IZZE brand when he decided to give up soda last year.  I teased him at first that giving up soda for another kind of soda was pointless, but after trying these myself I am sold.  IZZE contains all natural ingredients and no artificial sweeteners--its only fruit juice and sparkling water!  It gives you the satisfaction of a bubbly drink without all of the bad things.  Low calorie and great flavor.  Our local stores only have a few of the flavors available, so we have not tried all of the different kinds, but so far pomegranate is our favorite.  We prefer the glass bottle drinks to the cans, but again they are hard to find locally.  I purchased this 24 pack on Amazon when I couldn't find any at Walmart.  I will buy more cases from Amazon in the future.

review/summary: good but you can find cheaper
review/text: Love the drink.  Been drinking diet soda ever since, well, since diet soda came out.  Have not had a soda or artificial sweeteners for a week now.  Thought this would be a good alternative since I'm mostly addicted to the carbonation.  The flavor is mild but I think you can basically make your own by buying your favorite fruit juice and sparkling water.  I was also shocked by Amazon's price.  I bought the 24 pack at Costco for $13. I gave it 5 stars because it is really good if you want to spend the money on it.

review/summary: Izze Fortified sparkling juice, pomegranate
review/text: Absolutely love the Izze sparkling pomegranate drink.  It is much healthier for you than regular sodas.  Taste is great.  This is the only drink compatible to soda but none of the unhealthy issues.  This goes great in the pomegranite margaritas....LOVE IT...Was only available from Target and used to buy it by the case.  They no longer sell it.  Price is much better on Amazon plus no tax and free shipping.  Has a sharp fruity taste...If you get the chance to try one you will be hooked.  By the way I grew up not drinking sodas...

review/summary: Pretty good drink
review/text: I buy IZZE when it's on sale on Amazon. This Pomegranate flavor is pretty good. If you're looking for pure Pomegranate juice this is not it - go buy that Pom Wonderful stuff. This is a pomegranate flavored sparkling juice - with different juices mixed together. It's not too sweet, kinda tart, and very refreshing. To me the taste is a cross between pomegranate and cranberry. It's 70% fruit juice and 30% water - that's it. No added ingredients that you can't pronounce, none of that corn syrup stuff that everyone is scared about and no added sugar. I really like it.

review/text: IZZE has seemed to find the balance between healthy fruit taste and the sensation of carbonated soft drinks with their sparkling juice line.  I haven't had a soft drink in over a year since discovering these wonderfully refreshing, healthy alternatives to carbonated soft drinks.  Since it's pure fruit juice, it's also naturally weet (but not too sweet) so it also satisfies that "sweet tooth" as well.  Although not a substitute for plain ol' H2O, this beverage definitely satisfies and quenches my thirst.  Can't get enough of these beverages.......

review/text: Upon first trying this drink, I was somewhat put off. I've never had pomegranate anything, but based on other reviews I decided to give it a try. It tasted different, for sure, but after the first one, I realized I was having to limit myself to 2 cans a day. I guess it's an acquired taste, but once acquired, you'll never have enough! I love these things, and can't wait to try the other flavors.

Pomegranate is a great flavor, harder to find than some of the others.  I also really like grapefruit, blackberry and clementine orange Izzes.  Pear is great but I haven't been able to find it for quite some time.

review/summary: A bit of a let down.
review/text: I'm a fan of (most) Izze sodas and a big fan of pomegranate, so I thought this flavor would be a sure bet.  I was, however, disappointed.<br /><br />First up, the good.  The 8.4 ounce can size is perfect for a quick thirst-quencher.  While the calorie count is comparable to other regular sodas, it's a bit lower and consists of natural sugars from juices... not high fructose corn syrup. (What is that stuff anyway?) And, it's fizzy.  I like the fizz.<br /><br />Now for the bad: it barely tastes like pomegranate.  I realize that most folks would be turned off by an overly-tart, full force pom flavor; but the can promises pomegranate.  Yet reading the ingredients, pomegranate is listed fifth in the juice list. Fifth.  Behind apple, grape, pineapple, and lemon.  Oddly enough, the sixth juice: cranberry, seems to steal the show as that's the flavor I was able to notice other than the over-powering grape.<br />And that makes me sad.  Izze's other flavors (like grapefruit and clementine) really showcase the fruit on the label.  Just not here.<br /><br />If you'd rather have a sweet drink than a real pom experience, give this a shot. But if you're looking for some honest pomegranate flavor, look elsewhere.

review/summary: Pomegranate: Oddly tastes more like grapefruit, with no grapefruit.
review/text: I have tried four flavors of the Izze drinks.  Pomegranate, Blackberry, Apple and Grapefruit.<br /><br />My main interest in the four was the Pomegranate, and it's surprising my least favorite.  First of all, it's bitter, tastes like grapefruit, contains no grapefruit, and their Grapefruit drink is sweeter and more enjoyable.  -- which I would have expected to be my least favorite.<br /><br />I never drink sugar, so Izze is a welcomed beverage alternative to aspartame sodas.<br /><br />All of their drinks have a white grape and apple juice base. And all from concentrate with a slightly sparkling water mix.  Not carbonated, just a little fizz.<br /><br />Slightly on the pricey side, but for pomegranate product, it's acceptable.  But the pomegranate comes after the grape juice, apple, pineapple, lemon and cranberry in the ingredient list.

review/summary: Fizzy Goodness
review/text: I tried two flavors of these Izze cans - Clementine and Pomegranate.<br /><br />What I like: Real juice - no artificial sweeteners or high fructose corn syrup. Better for you than a soda. The smaller serving size is just right and the can is a comfortable shape to hold. I liked both of these flavors, with the Pomegranate coming out slightly ahead. Both were a nice mix of tart and sweet. They also make great vodka mixers.<br /><br />What could be better: These really need to be cold to be at their best in flavor and fizz. I often prefer drinks to be room-temp because my teeth can be cold-sensitive. If you're looking for a fizz fix, then there are flavored, unsweetened sparkling waters out there that would satisfy without any calories at all.<br /><br />Miscellaneous notes: As others have said before, be aware that the flavor juice is not necessarily the main juice (pomegranate), or even present at all (clementine). They're not a complete source of the fortified vitamins, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />It all comes down to what you're looking for. Looking for a sparkling juice that's relatively good for you? This is an excellent and recommended answer.

review/summary: How about a Dizzy Izze?
review/text: My husband and I tried the pomegranate, which is tart and refreshing, but as I don't drink soda at all, I tasted a bit too much sugar for my taste. But something in the flavor put us in a creative frame of mind, and we decided to have a little fun. So we tried Izze pomegranate and vodka, Izze pomegranate and gin, and then both of these with some OJ. The OJ adds a definite sweet/citrus taste and is quite refreshing with or without the alcohol. This is how we named and rated them:<br /><br />1. Pomegranate/OJ/gin--a Bloody Orange<br />2. Pomegranate/gin--a Gin Izze<br />3. Pomegranate/OJ/vodka--an Izze Navel<br />4. Pomegranate/vodka--a Dizzy Izze<br /><br />Try them this summer!

review/summary: A nice pick me up
review/text: Soft drinks and sparkling water drinks rarely meet over due to their nature. Increasingly, like San Pellegrino, companies have decided to use a simple sparkling water and fruit juice blend to keep sugar contents down and your palatte refreshed.<br /><br />I've been a fan of Izze drinks for a while, but I really really like this Pomegranated Flavored Sparkling Juice. I have always been a fan of mixing almost anything with club soda or mineral water (tonic water has too much sugar... have you read the calories?)  to cut down the bite of some of the stronger juices and alcohols. Izze has done a nice job here. The pomegranate juice still retains it's acidic bite while the bubbly mineral water smoothens it out at the end. At 8.4 ounces, it's a nice little glass of juice and a perfect mid afternoon refresher with cheese or fruits. I'll be buying a few more packs of these!

review/summary: A tad too sweet for my taste
review/text: Izze makes some very good juices, and advertises that their juice contains nothing other than fruit juice and sparkling water.  These are undoubtedly far, far better for you than, say, a Coke or a Pepsi.  They taste better and are more refreshing, and they certainly have a more natural feel to them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that, like many juices that claim to be all fruit juice, the vast majority of the juice in this particular blend appears to be apple and grape, which are much sweeter fruits in comparison with the tarter flavors.  Everyone knows pomegranate is good for you, but my guess is that the percent of this juice that is actual pomegranate is quite small--perhaps as low as 2 or 3 percent--and so contrary to what other reviewers have said, any health advantages are quite minimal.<br /><br />All that being said, these are certainly a superior option to other soft drinks.  Just don't think these are as good as water.

review/summary: Pretty good, Could be a little sweeter.
review/text: I think the warnings about drug interactions should have no bearing on the product review. Obviously, if you're on a certain medication with known food interactions, you need to be cautious of certain foods. That shouldn't effect how we rate those products for the rest of the world. Medication concerns aside, the drink is very fruity, and refreshing. It is a very nice alternative to plain fruit juice or soda, and far healthier since soda contains no nutrition whatsoever.  This does taste very much like a fresh fruit juice spritzer with authentic flavor, not artificial in any way.  It doesn't have a "canned" taste as some fruit drinks in cans do.  I would have liked it to be a tad sweeter, but accomplished that by adding a splash of fresh fruit juice or a flavored syrup such as Torani. The flavor of the product itself is akin to an Italian soda.  I withheld one star because I thought the product straight from the can was a little overly "fuzzy" but fares well when poured over ice.  For those trying the pomegranate flavor, be forewarned that this is a "blend" including other fruit juices, not straight pom.  The flavor of pomegranate is still plentiful, but not like drinking it straight.  Overall, I think this would make a wonderful addition to the summer picnic cooler or to serve guests at a dinner party. Served in glasses, rather than a can, it would make an impressive dinner beverage to accompany an elegant meal for guests. I would recommend it.

review/text: Although a little bitter, I do like the IZZE sparkling pomegranate carbonated fruit drink.  With a case of 24, I was able to share and get the opinions of friends and co-workers as well.  They noted the bitter taste but one friend mentioned how that could lend itself to be excellent in a mixed drink...come up with your own cool creation.<br /><br />Carbonated fruit drinks are always my favorite. I always mix ginger ale or club soda with my fruit juices.  It's especially great cold.  For me, the 8.4 oz size is perfect.  I tend to waste when I have 10 oz or more.<br /><br />This is something I would definitely buy and I would love to try the other flavors.  In addition, I love that IZZE has partnered w/Global Education Fund to help children around the world. A good drink, great cause...wonderful combination.

review/summary: Too sour and bitter for my taste
review/text: The Izze all natural Pomegranate drink is a great idea.  A Natural drink with no artificial sweeteners or even refined sugar. Best of all, no corn syrup.  It sounds like a nice healthy drink, right?  Well, the reality is that it just didn't taste very good to me. And, although it claims to have 70 percent juice... most of the juice isn't Pomegranate juice.<br /><br />Here's the rundown:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-All Natural<br />-No refined sugar or corn syrup added<br />-70 percent juice content<br />-Fortified with vitamins<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Doesn't taste good. Sour, bitter, and tastes more like wine than juice.<br />-Most of the juice isn't pomegranate... it's a mix of apple, pear...etc<br />-Isn't sweet enough... they could have used raw sugar, I wouldn't mind.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I just didn't like the taste of it. It may be more healthy for you than most other drinks... but if it doesn't taste good, what's the point? I expected it to taste like pomegranate, and it totally didn't. There's not even much pomegranate juice in it. Though, if you are into wine, you may like it. It tastes more like wine than juice.

review/summary: Soda Juice
review/text: In the Beginning there was Fruit Juice, and there was Soda Pop, and never the twain should meet... unless you mixed them yourself.  But then somebody got the Great Idea -- when reconstituting fruit juice after Pasteurization, why not reconstitute it with carbonated water?  Thus was born...<br /><br />Soda Juice!<br /><br />And I tasted it, and it was Good!  Apple and Blackberry were both rather mild tasting; Clementine and Grapefruit a little stronger and more tart; and Pomegranate had the strongest taste.  I'd say Pomegranate and Grapefruit were my favorites, but I enjoyed all of them.<br /><br />In the cans you have 5 flavor choices: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYY1E">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Apple, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXYW">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Blackberry, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXTC">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Grapefruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014WYXQK">Izze All Natural Sparkling Juice, Pomegranate, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>.  The only difference between Izze in the cans and Izze in the bottles, other than the obvious of size and container, is that only Izze in the cans is fortified with vitamins: C, B6, and Niacin, plus the fact that currently <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NUBTQQ">Izze Sparkling Blueberry Soda (12 ounce)</a> and Izze Sparkling Peach Soda (12 ounce) are only available in bottles.<br /><br />Since virtually nothing is added, the slight nutritional differences must be due to the characteristics of the different juices being used.  Apple, Blackberry, and Grapefruit have the highest calories, 90, Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 80.  Apple, Blackberry, and Clementine have the highest sodium, 15mg; Grapefruit and Pomegranate the lowest, 10mg.  Apple and Blackberry have the highest total carbohydrates, 21; Clementine, Grapefruit, and Pomegranate the lowest, 20.  Finally Apple has the highest sugars, 21g; Blackberry and Grapefruit are next, 20g; and Clementine and Pomegranate the lowest, 19g.<br /><br />Note: as other reviewers have already mentioned, all of these are fruit juice blends so those with fruit juice health concerns need to be aware of more than just the title juice.  All contain white grape, apple, and lemon juice.  In addition to their title juices Blackberry contains raspberry; Grapefruit contains orange; and Pomegranate contains clarified pineapple and cranberry juice.<br /><br />Compare and Contrast: a similar product is worth considering: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDDHPQ">essn Sparkling Blood Orange & Cranberry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDHBWG">essn Sparkling Fuji Apple Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001687ZT4">essn Sparkling Mango & Passion Fruit, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BDGA5A">essn Sparkling Meyer Lemon Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>, essn Sparkling Minneola Tangerine Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24), and essn Sparkling Pomegranate & Montmorency Cherry Juice, 8.4-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24).  The difference?  The essn products lack the vitamin fortification, have a higher carbonated water to juice ratio, and have roughly twice the calories, total carbohydrates, and sugars of the Izze products, probably because they contain the fruit pulp, which the Izze products do not.

review/summary: Pleasantly sophisticated tasting, in a reasonable portion
review/text: I've been a fan of IZZE drinks for some time.  The taste is sophisticated, the ingredients are natural, and the stuff is pretty to look at in a clear glass.  It's casual enough to drink with your lunchtime sandwich but it wouldn't be out of place served with H'ors deurves or in a nicer setting in place of sparkling water or wine.<br /><br />For this flavor, pomegranate juice is several entries into the ingredient list.  That means the pomegranate flavor is not very pronounced (though it's there), which may be a good thing since the juice normally packs a major flavor punch.<br /><br />I'd describe the carbonation as light-to-medium, pleasant like sparkling water rather than burn-y like Coke.<br /><br />This drink is now labeled "Fortified" but tastes the same to me as the previous non-fortified version; some additional vitamins have been added according to the label.<br /><br />Other thoughts: It's nice to see a reasonably sized portion (both in quantity and calories, only 80) in this era of supersized food, and supersized people.  The lightweight aluminum can is an enviro-friendly way to package drinks.  Recycle it!

review/summary: Satisfying with just enough of a tang to make your mouth water
review/text: If you're like me, you try to steer clear of colas and especially anything with high fructose corn syrup, yet you're a bit nervous of the calorie count from, say, orange juice, and you like a bit of sparkle to your drinks, as well. When I saw IZZE, it looked like the ideal solution. It's got a bit of fizz, real fruit juices, and a few vitamins. At 80 calories per 8.4 oz can, it won't break your diet, and it doesn't have any high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />So, how does it taste?<br /><br />Actually, it's pretty good. The pomegranate flavor gives it a nice tang without being overwhelming. The carbonation is light, just enough to give the drink a bit of extra zip without being threatening to overwhelm your stomach. And IZZE is sweet enough that I can enjoy it as a sort of reward for a workout, without being sticky or overly-sweet the way some traditional soft drinks can be.<br /><br />As a test, I tried one can at room temperature--it's a test I won't repeat. But served nicely chilled and straight out of the refrigerator or over ice, IZZE is an enjoyable treat--without completely busting the calorie count.

review/summary: A refreshing beverage
review/text: We first started buying Izze drinks when my wife was pregnant and she was looking for alternatives to soda and coffee. The Izze products were among her favorites -- especially the Black Cherry flavor. The Pomegranate variety is tasty as well, consisting of 70% fruit juice and 30% sparkling water. They make for a refreshing drink, although not a very large one (just over 8 ounces). One thing to note is that these drinks have 80 calories each, so that is something to be aware of. They're better than soda, but are far from calorie-free.

review/summary: Sparkling and Light
review/text: Wow!  Izze is a bright taste indeed.  Major Plus Factors: It is neither too sweet, too heavy, or loaded with any kind of additives. It is a healthful drink and this factor alone makes it ideal for people who search for alternatives to those ghastly flavored, carbonated sugar water soft drinks like coke or pepsi, etc, or other type of fruit drinks loaded with high fructose corn syrup which create false hunger and are so toxic to the liver.  AND, Izze is FREE of the dangerous caffeine junk that fries your nervous system like some of those such as red bull, etc. guzzled by silly "celebrities".  Izze is carbonated which works for my husband, albeit it is not my personal preference.  That said, Izze is great in fruit smoothies adding a lift with the fizz. I experimented by adding it to regular, unsweetened Dole orange/pineapple fruit juice and it really punched up that concoction. My taste buds were twangin'! I also see this used to add zip to homemade fresh fruit sauces,(think all kinds of berries, peaches, apricots, etc) for use over ice cream or frozen yoghurt sundaes, or in fruit shakes, custards, and yummy syrups over pancakes and waffles. The fact that is has zero sugar is a major plus for diabetics as well as those who seek alternatives to sugar overload. For those who do want a sweeter taste, I suggest adding a mere eighth teaspoon of Xylitol which I use in place of sugar because it is healthful and tastes just like sugar. AND, Xylitol doesn't adds a single calorie. Nor will it skew blood sugar values or promote sugar high and low crashes. This small addition of Xylitol really punches up the overall taste.  Bottom Line: This family really likes Izze for it's clean, sparkling and light taste plus the health benefits of the pomegranate fruit in this specific drink.

review/summary: Far superior to your local vending machine
review/text: Izze Beverages offers a variety of aromatic and refreshing line of drinks that are healthier and better-tasting alternative to soft drinks. Consisting of all natural ingredients (70% juice and sparkling water) and with no added sugars or caffeine, Izze's drinks are simply a better choice for you and your body. With a creative blend of juice concentrates -- for example, the pomegranate drink consists of apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate juice -- the taste experience is far, far superior to almost any drink you'll be likely to find in your local vending machine.<br /><br />Interestingly, Izze is packaged in 8.4 fluid ounce cans. A trade-off in using natural fruit juices is higher calorie content, so perhaps the tall, slim design of the can and its smaller volume is intended to help offset, both psychologically and materially, the reality of consuming an 80 calorie drink.<br /><br />However, Izze does not fare as well with competitive products from R.W. Knudsen whose drinks are made with 100% juice and are offered in 12 fluid ounce cans for about the same price as Izze. But perhaps more tellingly, Knudsen does not feel compelled to fortify their drinks with needless vitamins nor do they wear their corporate philanthropy on their sleeves to the extent that Izze feels compelled to do. One wonders if all this might be due to Pepsi's acquisition of Izze in 2006; the benefit of Pepsi's sales and distribution network might have come at the cost of marketing hyperbole and the production of a slightly less desirable product.<br /><br />Still, Izze shows that the soft drink industry is on the right track. If you normally consume artifically-sweetened soft drinks, choosing to enjoy the unique taste experience of Izze's all-natural product line (with delicious specialty flavors such as grapefruit and pomegranate) should be an easy decision for you to make. But if you are a little more finicky and prefer an 100% juice drink, you might also look into some of the other alternatives that are available to you.

review/summary: Good stuff...
review/text: I'm not big on sodas, but I do like pomegranate juice, so thought I'd give this tasty beverage a try. It is indeed tasty, a mix of several juices and sparkling water. The more expensive pomegranate comes in fifth out of five juices in terms of content, but the pomegranate taste predominates. There are 80 calories in the 8.4 oz. can, so it's not like diet soda, but it's a refreshing alternative when you feel that you can stand a few calories.

review/summary: TERRIFIC NATURAL FORTIFIED JUICE
review/text: My family loves this product.<br /><br />My wife likes the small compactness, it's easy not only easy to carry but satisfying in flavor and the handy 8 oz amount.  Even our teenage son finds it refreshing and just sweet enough.<br /><br />The mix of pure fruit juice and sparkling water is nicely balanced and the fact that it is "vitamin fortified" is a plus factor. At the very least it helps rationalize drinking this tasty canned juice.  And who know, it might even be good for you!<br /><br />Personally, I am especially fond of the sparkling pomegranate and like to dilute it with an equal amount of club soda or just cool water.  It also makes a great mixer for all kinds of drinks, alcoholic or not.<br /><br />I hope this drink catches on and that other exotic flavors are added to the product line.<br /><br />Definitely recommended for those who like fruit flavored drinks in nice packaging and handy sized containers.

review/summary: Pleasant enough
review/text: My husband and I both tried Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice and here's what we think:<br /><br />First Impressions...<br />We are not sure we can taste the Pomegranate in it, but my husband definitely tastes apple juice which is really not surprising because that's at the top of the ingredient list, followed by grape juice and others. I like that it is not super-sweet and only sparkles moderately, quite pleasant and refreshing actually.<br /><br />Second Sips...<br />We both come to the conclusion that it almost has a wine-y taste, as if one were drinking an alcoholic beverage - maybe due to the grape juice? My husband also remarks that it would probably be great as a mix with alcohol, but let's not go there for the purpose of this review :-)<br /><br />Conclusions...<br />We like it better than we thought we would, especially my husband who at first was very skeptical of the idea of having to drink sparkling pomegranate juice. It is quite refreshing and a great thirst quencher on hot days although I am not sure that it is something other than a regular, not-so-sweet soda. I don't have much to say about the added vitamins - I, for one, don't need them but they likely won't hurt either.<br />We will probably buy this again from time to time, just for a change from the same-old sodas in our fridge...

review/text: I'm a single guy in my mid-50's. I like to work-out and stay in shape.  During the week, I drink bottled water and non-sugar fruit juices. I like the Izze Natural Juice. It's tangy, and full of Vitamin C and Vitamin b6(a helpful ingredient for good disposition). There's no sugar, no caffine, and no preservatives. This flavor has apple, grape, and pineapple. cool. My only gripe is it comes in a can. I like Diet Snapple because it's in a bottle. Something about metal cans. I drink Red Bull, but not for the taste.

review/summary: Nice Taste
review/text: I often take some juice and add a bit of seltzer to make my own more natural soda.  Now with Izze, I have a company that has taken that idea and created a line of sparkling beverages.  I just drank my first can of Sparkling Pomegranate.  I found the taste to be enjoyable, with just the right amount of fizz.  These are rather small cans, being tall and skinny and holding 8.4 oz.  There is very little sodium and no refined sugars, though natural sugar does amount to 19g for a can.  I liked the fact that it was all natural fruit juice.  The only thing to note is that this is not 100% Pomegranate, it is a mix of apple, white grape, pineapple and cranberry with pomegranate.  Very nice smooth taste and something I would purchase.

review/summary: A Decent Alternative To Soda
review/text: Izze All Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a nice alternative to the normal breeds of soda such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Dr. Pepper.  It doesn't compare, however, to sodas that it will probably have more direct competition from such as Sunkist, the numerous Fanta flavors and others.  Why?  Because when most folks want a soda, they want a sugar-laden treat that'll give them a little spark.  This is soda for folks who care a bit more about their health than the average joe.  It's also a good choice for people who may not be able to drink sugar-shockers like Cherry Coke.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Izze Sparkling Juice is bad.  In fact, it tastes pretty good.  It contains seventy percent fruit juice (and most of that is white grape and apple) and thirty percent sparkling water.  The sugars that are contained in this drink are all natural.  It's also got a few vitamins in there, which are a plus.<br /><br />The pomegranate juice has a bit of a tart bite to it, and in my opinion the lemon juice that's also contained in this drink stands out a bit.  The can is 8.4 ounces, so you won't be getting the usual twelve ounces from the average can of soda.  Be sure to drink it very cold, because much like Miller Lite, it's pretty rank when it's warm or just a tad cool.<br /><br />In closing, Izze's got a good thing going with their sparkling juices.  This item will probably fit best in the health niche market, and I don't see it hurting the sales of Sunkist any time soon.  Give it a shot if you are looking for a Coca-cola subsitute.

review/text: I like that the soda is made from fruit juice but it is misleading in that it is not all pomegranate, it also has apple, white grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and the last on the list is pomegranate. If you like a sweet soda you probably won't like this since it is very tart, I was surprised at how tart this was. It has a good fizz to it and is 80 calories per can, the cans are only 8.4 oz so it is smaller than other types but is refreshing. I would recommend this soda since it is a healthy alternative to other types of soda.

review/summary: Tart, but good
review/text: Izze's All-Natural Sparkling Pomegranate Juice is a good, tart juice.  It tastes great on its own, and would probably also work well as a mixer (with a small scoop of natural vanilla ice cream?) -- the possibilities are limitless.<br /><br />I just got this juice today, and decided to give it the most extreme test I have -- drinking some right after finishing a little bit of exercise.  I was very pleasantly surprised; after drinking this juice, I felt more refreshed and even a bit more filled than other juices of this type.  (And for a dieter, this is a big-time plus.)<br /><br />Note that this isn't a sweet juice; if you're seeking that, look elsewhere.<br /><br />However, as a natural juice (unsweetened by anything save the fructose of the fruit itself), it has a fine, full-bodied taste that is worth savoring over a tall glass of crushed ice.  It's a bit similar to natural cranberry juices; if you like those, you will like this.<br /><br />Four stars, recommended.<br /><br />Barb Caffrey

review/summary: Soda you can feel good about drinking
review/text: It's hard to go wrong with Izze. It's just like soda, except it's made with actual fruit juice. No sugar or artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />This particular blend is described as pomegranate, but it's a mix of apple, grape, pineapple, lemon, cranberry and pomegranate. Overall it's tart and refreshing, not too sweet. However, the taste of grape and cranberry rather overpowers the pomegranate. Also, with the recent focus on pomegranate as a particularly healthy juice, it would be nice if the pomegranate-to-everything-else ratio was higher, so I'm only going to give it 4 out of 5.<br /><br />As to the fortification, as with most fortified foods it's more of a selling point than something of real value. You're better off getting your vitamins from a healthy diet, or (if you must) a multivitamin tablet.<br /><br />However, I'll keep drinking Izze when I feel an urge to drink soda. It may not be the healthiest drink, but it's a lot healthier than the high fructose corn syrup and chemical flavorings sold by the two big name soda makers.

review/summary: A Refreshing Change
review/text: So, I havent even seen this product in a store near where I live, but do like to try new foodstuffs- so I was happy to order it as part of the vine program.  I was a little trepidatious about drinking it at first, but decided to pop the top of seven or eight cans (not all at once!) and drink quite a few before I reviewed it.  Now that I have that out of the way I can write a quick review.<br /><br />This soda is different.  Different good. Its got a taste that reminds me of Red Bull without the caffeine buzz.  On first sip, its got a funky aftertaste like beer, but then delves into a more tart, bitter taste before the natural sugars of the fruit juice come into play.  It tastes more like cranberry than pomegranate to me, and the others that I have shared this soda with with agree with me on that point.<br /><br />True, its not full of artifical sugars and so this soda isnt a sweet taste like we are all used to with carbonated beverages.  Its more "dry" in flavor and tastes like fruit juice mixed with seltzer water.  Not a bad taste, mind you, but one that takes two or three cans before it grows on you.  I like this soda, and if the stores in my area ever decide to stock it, I will happily pick up a case and even adventure out into other flavors to try.  Heck, I might have to shop on Amazon so I can pick some up every now a then  :)<br /><br />I dont give this soda to my kids, because to me, it has a more "grown-up" flavor to it.  Its not sugary and sweet and syrupy like modern soda, but it does have a refreshing, fresh, tart flavor that is surprisingly good.  At 8.4 ounces per can, it is a bit smaller than the 12oz. sodas we usually see, but this wasnt even a issue to me.  I like this stuff and cant wait to try the other flavors.  Trust me on this, do not jude this stuff by the first can alone.  Drink a couple and then form your opinion.  Good stuff, a refreshing change from Coke and Pepsi products.

review/text: This is by far the best of the Izze flavors.  It's light and delicious, and compared to the others I've tried (all but Apple) it easily tops the list.  The beverage is surprisingly thirst-quenching for such a slim, tiny bottle, and the best thing is that it's also quite versatile.  Too tired after work to break out multiple bottles and shake up a cocktail?  Just add two shots of your favorite brand of Vodka or Gin to one of these babies, cold out of the fridge, and drink up.  It's a light, fantastic way to relax.  The beauty of Izze drinks is that they aren't heavily carbonated like soda, so they don't really go flat, and they aren't heavily sugared like most juices, so they don't overwhelm your palette.  I couldn't recommend this product more highly.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Strong, less sweet taste
review/text: If you are used to Hawaiian Punch, Snapple, sugary Kool-aid, or other "fruity" drinks, you won't find the same high fructose corn syrup kick in this product.  It actually tastes like real fruit juice...imagine that.<br /><br />I'll admit I like sweet fake-fruit drinks as much as the next person, so my first few sips of Izze's pomegranate sparkling water made me question my selection.  I had expected something more akin to lightly flavored water, but the taste was an overwhelming tartness.<br /><br />I have learned to enjoy though and wish my parents had given me this as a kid so that my tastebuds would consider this "sweet".  It is still a little strong and tart for me, so I mix it 1-to-1 with water.  Diluted by half is still enough flavor for me, so each 12 once can actually doubles in size when I drink it.<br /><br />Lastly, everything about the company suggests they will appeal to progressive-minded individuals, from their use of all natural products, their green endeavors (factories powered by wind) and their philanthropic operations.

review/summary: Izze drinkable? Yes, he is.
review/text: I've been enjoying my Izze Pomegranate juice, and I'll tell you why:<br /><br />1. It's crisp and refreshing. Since it is mostly fruit juice and carbonated water, the only sugar is naturally occuring in the juice.<br /><br />2. It has 70% real fruit juice. The benefits of that are spelled out on the nutritional facts label. 10% of your daily vitamin C, B6 and niacin is in every can.<br /><br />3. The absensce of high fructose corn syrup. That heavy, ubiquitous sugar substitute we find in nearly every processed food in America these days, especially in the soft drinks. Izze has none of that.<br /><br />One gripe - The cans are small at 8.4 ounces. That usually leaves me wanting more. It's an encouraging sign that people are willing to eat food in small quantities like this, but making these closer to the size of a typical soda can and adding another 20-30 calories would be great.

review/summary: Real, True Earl Grey Tea, Delicious and Hard to Find
review/text: *****<br />If you love bergamot (as I do) then this is your tea. Numi Tea is all high quality, and this aged Earl Grey is no exception. It is a strong, fine tea, and the bergamot is the star. I noticed that it has been mentioned here that the bergamot flavor is too mild; to me, the bergamot flavor is quite prominent, but I don't drink artificially flavored tea, so if you do, this might be a change for you. I love it and would not go back to fake bergamot for anything--real bergamot is a treat and hard to find. Over time, you really don't want anything else and the fake stuff tastes chemically. So if you want to try the real thing, I think you'll love this tea.<br /><br />This tea is certified organic and contains just Organic Assam Black Tea TGFOP Grade 1 (Oxidized Camellia Sinensis) scented with organic Italian Bergamot Fruit (Citrus Bergamia). It is also kosher. On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Numi's special Earl Grey is oil-free, using a unique method of aging premium Italian bergamot fruit with malty Assam black tea. When brewed, it imparts an exquisite red-orange hue that calls to mind dawn's finest moments. Balanced and stunning, we've recreated this timeless classic."<br /><br />The price is perfect, a nice savings over single boxes. If you like Earl Grey tea, get it---you won't be sorry.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/summary: Worth trying
review/text: This tea has a smooth, well rounded flavor and goes very well with steamed milk. I drink tea all day, and Earl Grey is my go to black tea. Earl Grey is great black, and a bit of extra dark chocolate on the side is better. Nothing breaks a hot day, or tension like a good tea. This tea has an aroma that pulls. Of the many brands out there this is definitely in my top 5(like #4 or maybe 3), because of the consistency in flavor, good selection, and the company mantra doesn't hurt either. I generally let this tea steep much longer than other brands, because it just doesn't get bitter. My wife got me hook on Earl Grey lattes, and everyone I've offered it to. If you're looking to try something new or a different brand, Numi is well worth a try. And if you've never had the latte it's: a splash of hot water, tea, vanilla syrup (I like just a shot for 16 to 20 oz, but the amount's up to you), and fill with hot milk.

review/summary: not very strong on the bergamot scent
review/text: One of the reasons why I love Early Grey tea is the scent of bergamot oil and the strong black tea flavor. This tea, was no Earl Grey. It was more like Assam, with a hint of bergamot oil. If you like Earl Grey, I suggest you try Mariage Fr&egrave;res French Blue Earl Grey or Adagio's Earl Grey. If you like organic, try Mighty Leaf.

review/summary: Weak, poor quality, tasteless!
review/text: The tea is weak, without the slightest hint of bergamot scent or taste.  Even if it were plain black tea, it is of inferior quality. They make a big deal of their organic, wholesome, green image. It's all fancy marketing and packaging. I paid 8.99 for a box of 18 bags at a drugstore. I truly feel gypped.

review/summary: They ruined their perfect product (the only legit, non-oil-sprayed EG widely available)
review/text: As you can see, I ordered a set of three boxes of these, happy for free shipping and a good price, which Amazon usually lacks on groceries... and how disappointed I was, not in Amazon but in Numi...<br /><br />I guess too many complained that the SMELL wasn't like other EGs, and they're right... it wasn't. Others spray alcohol-containing, leaf-wrecking oils on the leaves, leaving behind a horrible taste to me and also making the leaves oxidize rapidly, making the tea quality suck! Numi HAD it absolutely perfect. I was ready to tell you how to get, out of their tea, the perfect GENUINE Earl Grey tea, one where the tea wasn't killed by modern techniques of spraying chemicals (essential oils are almost all alcohol, after all; bergamot oil is almost always mixed with cheaper and easier to process citrus that grows far more places than a tiny town in Italy)... and now, I'm just here to say "move along, nothing here to see" because in changing their fruit supplier or aging/malting process or -something- (the tea leaves wouldn't likely vary so much, the brews side by side making the same color and the leaves being cut the same way and clearly the same region and process--yes, I'm one of THOSE tea drinkers, Steepster reviews and all), from the bags smelling like another brand, a rather costly one that starts with R and nearly rhymes with fishy, which has rather funky EG (that brand sprays the leaves, which Numi proclaims my shared disdain for)... well, what was--back when they had the boxes with the old man and his walking stick slumped in front of a cottage or whatnot--the first and only EG I would drink happily, a tea I went to specific 24/7 restaurants at 2am when needing food just because I could at least count on the tea... well, it's a passing memory, one I have about half a dozen more memories to treasure before parting ways with Numi, probably with an email expressing sadness.<br /><br />I DO overall recommend their teas: The lemon myrtle chamomile, now deceptively called lemon chamomile when it's the FLOWER not the fruit added to lovely organic chamomile, is hopefully still as wonderful, their Moroccan Mint is unsurpassed and the smoothest, sweetest mint imaginable, impossible to oversteep for that matter, able to handle a trio of steepings for that matter [whereas Stash uses PNW mint that is medicinal, which is honestly only good to make yogurt sauce or ... medicine!], and even for the ones like Golden Chai that aren't to MY liking, they're still well made, just not a blend I care for ingredient-wise...<br /><br />I simply can't recommend THIS Numi product anymore (and I hope as I use the last of my others this proves the ONLY one that got "revamped" somehow, the "how" seemingly the fruit, whether they are doing it faster or using different fruit or outsourcing the bergamot processing or... whatever they changed to make it a stinky-bagged, fruitless flavored, bitter chemical-aftertaste tea). I tasted the new just one night after a week of delighting in their original blend night after night, using my reliable method with precise timing and all, went away from it a full month, and in finding the last half box of the old, decided to compare them to be sure it wasn't simply me being thrown off. It's not. I don't deem it so unworthy that it can't be a pleasant change for the people who benefit from our brunch outreaches geared at homeless populations, and it'll probably be a welcome addition, but I will NOT be drinking the other 51 bags from this purchase myself, not when I have teas I genuinely love (as I did this, which was barely drinkable with a LOT of sugar that rendered it barely-even-tea anymore--before, it was best with a tiny bit of sugar and milk, but it was absolutely palatable with no additions).

review/text: This is one of the best Earl Grey teas on sale in the U.S., but all too often supermarkets don't even carry it, and when they do they tend to price it rather high. I placed a recurring order for 3 boxes per month and get it cheaper than I ever would in a store owing to the discount applied for multiple purchases (and no postage costs). The parcel arrives promptly each month and the process is trouble free. I'd recommend it to any tea connoisseur.

review/summary: Expected something different
review/text: This tea is advertised as full leaf tea. If you're expecting full leaf tea, like you get at Starbucks these days, you will be disappointed (like me). It's not cut to a fine powder, like your average Lipton tea bag, but the tea does come in a regular tea bag, not a "satchel" with full leaf tea. If I had bought this tea as a regular bag Earl Grey, like a Twinings Earl Grey, I'd give it 4 stars. But, since it advertises full leaf, I'm giving it only 2. In my opinion, it is similar in quality and taste to Twinings.<br /><br />I up'd my rating to 3 stars. It is one of the better bag Earl Grey teas that I have had. I'm still disappointed that it's not a fuller-leaf tea, like you get from Revolution.

review/text: These are great juice boxes. First: the Orange Tangerine is delicious and generally hard to find in grocery stores. Second: this size is PERFECT for little people. These juice boxes are as small as you are going to find - but that is the point right? The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than 4-6oz of juice per day for children, so at 4.23 oz per box - you aren't loading them up with juice. We have these on subscribe and save, so always have them on hand when we are on the run. My kids love them for the flavor, and I love them for their size and 100% juice (no added sugar, additives) - a win for everyone!

review/summary: Not Like Mom Used To Make But Still Pretty Good
review/text: I initially purchased a few varieties of the Bumble Bee Salad snack kits to take out deer hunting with me.  I was looking for something easy to carry, didn't take up much room, was tasty, and would last for awhile without spoilage.<br /><br />The kit comes with a 3 ounce can of tuna salad, 6 crackers, and a small plastic paddle to spoon the salad on the crackers.  The tuna is in a metal can with a foil lid and the crackers are in a small cellophane (foil looking) pouch.  The little plastic piece is just floating around in there.<br /><br />After being carried and tossed around for a few weeks, I tore open a pack.  The crackers did not hold up too well to the abuse and were mostly a stack of pieces and crumbs.  The cardboard was splitting open allowing dirt to get inside, but at least the little plastic thing was still in there.<br /><br />The taste of the salad was actually quite good.  I did not think it had an overwhelming fishy smell which could be beneficial if you are eating it in close quarters to others who might not like fish.  There is more than enough salad for the crackers which is a nice surprise as most snacks seem to make you ration the spread.<br /><br />If you are on a diet, this meager snack is definitely not worth the 300 calories.  If you are looking for something portable to take on the road, hiking, fishing, hunting, or a snack to send to a soldier in the field, this is a handy, self contained snack.  If the packaging was a bit more durable to protect the crackers, I would say this would be pretty close to the perfect field snack.<br /><br />J. E. Nelson

review/text: I was happy to find Avena smoothies available in the US, as it is a delicious, smooth and nutritious drink that blends oats and milk. The Tetra pack with straw makes it perfect at home, for school lunches or on the go. It can be drunk by the glass, in cereal, or as a snack. The long expiration date (about 6 months without refrigeration) is a big plus. It is made in the USA and distributed directly by the manufacturer, Alpina Foods, out of Miami FL.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised at the ingredients: water, sugar, powdrered milk, oat flour, mono & diglycerides, carragenan, guar gum, xhantan gum, salt, sodium tripolyphosphate. In terms of nutrition: 180 calories, 4 grams of fat (3 are saturated), 10 mg cholesterol, 115 mg sodium, 22 gr sugar, 1 gr fiber, 5 gr protein, Calcium 16 DV%. While it tastes similar to real avena, the overly processed ingredients give me pause. I will be looking for a recipe for real avena which is probably not that hard to make and a lot healthier.<br /><br />As a sidenote, you can buy this at your local supermarket (in the section of south american foods) in 8 oz containers for half the price.

review/summary: Very good drinks
review/text: I bought the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00142IAKU">melon flavor</a> for myself and this strawberry for my father.  I was surprised that I really liked the melon, and my father had a great time opening the bottle of his strawberry.  He's the type who HAS to know how things work, so after finishing the drink he went about taking apart the top of the bottle!  Plus, he said that it "was a pretty good drink", which is a good compliment from him.<br /><br />We enjoyed the drinks quite a bit, and the bottle made an interesting conversation topic.  I'm sure that kids would love this.

review/text: When I got these, I was so excited. They were great, except one thing. Make it cold before drinking. It does not taste good warm.

review/summary: Goodish
review/text: Before buying this, I was unsure of what it would be. When I tasted it it was very sweet a little too much for my liking. Others may find it appealing, but only $1.99. Go ahead and try it

review/summary: Very good
review/text: Not sweet and syrupy like US sodas. Very refreshing with only 90 calories per 6.76 oz.  Bottle (7% carbs). Zero sodium, fats and cholesterol. The weird glass bottle is a hoot. No plastic bottle aftertaste.

review/summary: Yummy says my dog
review/text: Chef Michael's Grilled Sirloin food was a big hit with my dog.  It has a variety of pieces, meat and vegetables, soft and crunchy. It has big chunks that are meant to emulate real pieces of beef. My dog seemed to especially like those. He took each piece out of the bowl and chewed it up in the same manner he would eat a big piece of meat. When I first put some of this food in his bowl, he ate it up in no time and came sniffing around the bag for more. He's a big dog and eats a couple of good sized scoops of dry food each day, so this 4.5 pound bag lasted less than a week. It would last longer for a smaller dog and I'll buy a bigger bag next time I get some.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this dog food is the bag.  It has to be cut open, which is slightly less convenient than just ripping it or pulling on a string, but not a big deal. I also wish the bag were resealable with a Ziploc-type closure. I have to either transfer this food to another container once opened, or fold it up just so and push the open end against the wall to keep it shut. The bag, however, is not a deciding factor when I'm looking for a food my dog enjoys. I'll certainly consider this dog food in the future.
