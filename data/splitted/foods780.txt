review/summary: Best brand out there
review/text: Our son is now 11 months old and we've been using this brand since he started baby food. The taste is as close to the real thing as possibly. Other brands seem watered down compared to Earth's Best. The texture is smooth and flavorful. I like that they have a large variety of HEALTHY options that combine a whole variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and meats. In my opinion, there is no nutrition in mac and cheese so why bother giving it to them. They have different stages that seem to have been very appropriate for the eating abilities of my son. The soups served as a great transition to table food. It has bite size, soft pieces of vegetables and meats in a smooth baby food broth similar to consistency of regular babyfood.

review/text: My son loves this food.  He is 16 months now and I still use them.  Not all the time, but often.  The reason is that his molars are coming in very quickly and he is in a lot of pain.  He won't eat much when he's in pain, but these are easy on his gums.  They are organic and a quick meal.  My son is strong and a very healthy weight.  I make sure he gets as much organic, wholesome food as possible.  Buying these subscribe and save is a great way to give him good food and still save money.  He loves the whole line.

review/text: My son has eaten the Earth's Best fruits and veggies in the past and loves them so I thought I'd try the soups.  Epic fail!  He generally will try anything and will even eat a few things he's not a total fan of.  I've never seen him actually spit food out and continue to spit to get the taste out of his mouth.  Once I realized what he was doing, I got him some water.  Needless to say, this happened with each of the soups we tried.

review/text: At first, I loved Earths Best and it was about all I would buy. They dont taste bad and I love that they are organic but for stage three they are just not textured enough! All they have is a few chunks of carrot here or there. I will say that for the price and the size of each jar, there is still a value here and I will most likely stick to EB for stage 2 fruits but other than that I prefer Sprout baby food. It may be twice the price but in a chicken dish the first ingredient is chicken and I can honestly say I think it tastes good!

review/text: My son loves these soups particularly the butternut squash bisque. I'm a little confused that other reviewers said it lacked texture for a stage 3 food. It is soup people. Not even adult soup is necessarily chunky. I think it's a great transition from stage 2 to 3. I would also say that babies on stage 2 could probablyhandle these items.

review/summary: Great combo pack except strawberry and banana
review/text: I like all of the food in this combo except for strawberry and banana -- that does NOT seem like stage 3 food to me.  It is very thin and runny.  A food with this consistency does not belong with the others in this combo!  I really, really wish they would include a chunkier version.  It's enough to make me look into buying all the other foods in this pack individually.  Otherwise, this food is great, and I've had no trouble with broken jars, but I'm really frustrated by the runny strawberry/banana and it's enough to make me give 3 stars instead of 5, since it ruins the combo pack for me.

I searched a few brands and we both like Earth Best the most.  He eats his green veggies without gagging AND even eats MEAT now!!  I could not get him to eat any other brand of meat.  He loves it now!!!<br />Great brand and I trust it as a parent that I am givin him quality food.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: WARNING: Almost all of these "soups" contain dairy product. I was unaware of this until the item arrived. Even then I did not realize it until I was I already feeding my daughter one of the "soups" and she didn't seem to like it. Usually I do read ingredients before using any product, but I'd never ran into a problem with Earths Best before. My Daughter has a dairy allergy and in general doesn't like anything that contains dairy. So when she seemed fussy about eaiting this, a red flag went up for me as she usually eats whatever I feed her. Better labeling with a dairy or milk content warning would be a plus, or if in the description it listed not only the types of "soups" in this variety pack, but also the ingredients. I can't say what a baby without a dairy allergy might think of this product, but mine wanted nothing to do with it.

review/summary: BPA in lids !!!
review/text: I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty enough- but there are tastier out there, like Plum.

Unfortunately the broke during shipment. When they arrived and I opened the box I found a soggy cardboard pack of jars. I was afraid to even remove that plastic wrap to see which jars had broken or survived. I didn't want to risk spreading broken glass. So, Earth's Best food I am happy with. Ordering the jars online, not so great. I suggest sticking with the pouches when ordering baby food.

review/text: so we got this because it's organic, lots of veggies, etc all the things we think we should feed the baby.. but unfortunately it was a total waste of time and money.  my son would not eat it.  at all.  this is a little guy that will eat almost anything.  he's really not that picky at all.. if you saw him, you'd know, he's not thin!  but he would take a bite of this and spit it out, resulting in a lot of laundry and a lot of clean up in the kitchen!  i smelled and tasted it myself, and would have to agree that it's pretty gross.. and since we were stuck with this huge box of it, i tried everything, mixing it with fruit, dipping fruit / bread/ anything into it... and he would not eat it.  the earth's best jarred foods has a strange chemically taste / smell to it.  my son had no problem with any of the plum foods and i guess that's what we're sticking to now.  and to be honest, the plum tastes better to me as well.

review/summary: Not even close to the Original!
review/text: My husband went to the store for me and purchased this soup, not noticing it had a different label from regular Campbell's Chunky Chicken Corn Chowder. It was absolutely TERRIBLE. It was runny, very few vegetables and almost no chicken. The base was flavorless if anything. Like the other reviewer, I didn't finish it either. It was beyond bland, and I don't see how they can call it chunky when there was such a lack of anything to it plus the base was thin as water.<br />My favorite comfort food is the REGULAR Campbell's Chunky Corn Chowder. That one has a thicker more flavorful base and is full of chunks of vegetables and chicken.<br />This "healthy choice" version was as if they had taken the regular version and added 2 cans of water.

review/summary: Raspberry Tea with Hibiscus!
review/text: ****<br />Stash's Wild Raspberry Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is strong and fruity, great if you love the taste of raspberry and hibiscus, which I do. It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me; you should know this though in case you are allergic. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: Just brought home a young APBT from the human society. He's lovely and wants to learn, but finding treats that grabbed his attention was difficult.<br /><br />Bottom line is he goes NUTS for these. I'm working with him to get over triggers he has while we're out for walks. Mostly going insane around other dogs and crying, yelping, and eventually full on barking with serious leash tugging. I'm invisible when he goes into this freakout state, however with a little work the treats grab his attention and bring the focus back to me. I expect within a few months to have him totally over this problem, and I'm relieved to find a treat that can help get him over this problem with lots of diligent training.<br /><br />Thanks Tillman you beautiful skateboarding pooch!!!

review/text: These training treats work pretty good to reward my dog. I have used the chicken, lamb and beef so far and my dog eagerly eats them. These are moist squares of treat. I cut the squares into four smaller squares. If you bend it with your fingers it will break in two; but not as evenly as cutting it with a knife. I will buy more when I need them. I bought a couple packs of them. The bag that they come in is resealable. So I carry the bag in my waist pack so I can quickly reward my dog for wanted behavior.<br /><br />I cut my package of Natural Balance Training tips into 152 smaller squares. The original square size is less than the size of a quarter coin; but about that size in area.

I still prefer Wellness puppy treat. Wellness treat is softer and taste better (I guess from the reaction of my poochies). Oh I forgot to mention that I have 2 small puppies, who are morkie and maltese. They are finicky eaters. They eat this Natural Balance treat but just one piece and turn their faces away. However, when I show them just the package of wellness treat, they sit even before I tell them to. They both go crazy when they just smell the wellness treat from far away.<br />Goodluck!

review/text: My dog adores these treats.  The 1" squares are easily broken into smaller pieces for training and are sure to hold your dog's attention.  They also fit into the two rubber treat ball toys I have to keep my dog busy trying to get them out.

review/summary: My Dog likes Natural Balance Training tips.
review/text: My dog likes the Natural Balance training tips. They are moist yet break a part if needed. I cut each square into four parts. Though lately I've just started to tear off a bit for training. My dog likes these training tips as long as I don't give him them every day. So I also give him another jerky treat some of the time. I don't rely only on food training treats to train. I also use a tennis ball as he likes the balls usually more than the food treats.<br />I've just ordered two Kong rubber non-toxic balls for my dog as the felt on the tennis balls can hold onto abrasive debris. The Natural Balance Training tips are my dog's favorite food treat more than any of the others I've tried. He likes the chicken and beef the most.

review/text: Very fortunate that it worked/works for me. I took one capsule every time I pumped... It did the job. I pump exclusively and make sure to do it at least every three hours for 10 minutes. I'm able to produce approximately 30 ounces per day. I only took it for three days straight. Now I take a couple whenver I see my supply diminishing.

review/summary: Does what it is supposed to do
review/text: I am a working mother and have been pumping milk for my daughter for over 6 months. I have gotten busier and busier and became concerned when my milk began to taper. I use these supplements every time I start to see a lull in my milk supply. I usually take one a day at night and use them during the day if I plan on pumping regularly.<br /><br />I do not take a whole lot of it, just enough to keep myself pumping between 10 and 13 oz per day. It has worked wonders for me. I only wish I had this after my son was born. My milk dried up really quickly when he was around 8 months and he had to drink frozen for the remainder of his first year. Luckily, my daughter will have much more milk due to this product. I would recommend it.

review/text: I started taking this when my baby was about 10 months.  I have been trying to make it to one year nursing.  I didn't see a great increase, maybe a little.  It certainly didn't hurt anything to try it.  I have now stopped taking it and didn't see any difference when I stopped either.  I think it's something to try if you are really wanting to continue nursing and see a decrease in your production.

review/summary: Fenugreek
review/text: To be honest, I was hoping for the results that some women that reviewed these pills had.  I think that I had some milk increase, but nothing like what I had read on most of the reviews.  I tried pumping every two hours after returning to work and would be lucky if I pumped 2-2.5oz total from both breasts. I thought that meant that I had a milk supply problem, so I started taking Fenugreek.  When I first started taking the pills I was only taking two, twice a day.  That seemed to help a little and the morning pump I was pumping about 4oz each breast.  I slowly increased the amount of pills I was taking but it didn't seem to increase my milk supply.  I pump twice a day now and get anywhere from 10-12oz total for the day...that might get my baby through one day at day care.<br /><br />I think that this just works differently for different people.  I did notice that when I sweat I smelled like maple syrup, but that has since decreased and I don't notice it anymore.  I might have become more gassy, but it never affected my baby in a negative way...she has always remained a happy baby whether I'm taking it or not.  I'm still taking the pills a few times a day and just pump twice a day for whatever I can get.  I have started supplementing my baby (now almost 5 months) to start weaning.<br /><br />I would recommend Fenugreek if you think that your milk supply is low and you need a boost...it doesn't seem to hurt to try it.  I wished that I would have gotten what other women got, pumping 8-10oz per breast every pump...but alas I wasn't that lucky!

review/text: I pump then bottle feed my baby the breast milk. I began taking this as directed (2 pills/3x a day) and was able to pump about 2-3oz of milk each time (I pumped every 3 hours) on each side. When I noticed my baby started needing more I began taking 3 pills/3x a day and now get about 3-4oz each time I pump (still every 3 hours) on each side. I gave it 3 stars because my hope is I won't have to keep increasing the dosage just to pump more. Anyway it seems to be working out OK so far. Hope this review helps!

review/summary: helpful for breastfeeding
review/text: I wanted to breastfeed my son as long as possible, but I felt my supply was diminishing after only three months, and several sources pointed me to try fenugreek capsules. I ordered them, and before I received them I was supplementing one feeding a day with formula. After I started taking them, I noticed that I was able to pump more and my son seemed less hungry. (The one catch to this is that I was also drinking more fluids and pumping frequently also to help increase my supply, so I'm not 100% sure that it was because of the fenugreek, but there was a definite correlation there.) They taste kind of funny, sort of like maple syrup, and gel capsules are a little weird, but well worth it for the health and financial benefits of exclusive breastfeeding.

There was no downside when I stopped taking it, no side effects to myself or my son while taking it and it actually calmed his reflux some. The maple scent wasn't noticeable to anyone other than myself and went away when I stopped taking the supplement. I recommend it to every nursing mom I know that thinks they're having problems with supply.

review/text: I went back to work and started pumping when my baby was about 6 weeks old. I pump three times a day at work and nurse at night. At first I didn't have any problem (got ~4 oz. each time), but my milk supply began to decrease when my baby was about two months old so I searched on the internet and found this Fenugreek, but it took me a few weeks to decide to buy it (I tried to eat/drink more, but it didn't help). I take two pills three times a day and saw a slight change on my milk supply on the second day. It took about a week for me to really see a different. Now I get about 4-5 oz. each pump. Works great! I just wish I bought it a week sooner so my baby didn't have to take formula.

She was fine until i fed her the freshly pumped milk and she wouldnt drink over an ounce without fussing. I fed her directly from my breast (thinking maybe she just didnt want a bottle's nipple) and she ate a little more and fell asleep but then when she woke she screamed for hours as though she were in pain, curled up, turned red, wouldnt sleep for longer than ten minutes and it took me half a day to realize the only thing I had done different was take four of the capsules. I actually LIKED the maple syrup smell but she looked like she was in so much pain I just CANNOT give this a full five stars. There should be something on the label that warns or more reviews about it.

review/text: Who cares if you smell like maple syrup?! There are worse things you could be accused of smelling like!  It brought my milk supply up safely, so I'll take it!<br /><br />Beware the prescription galactogogues.  They worked for me, but had some side effects for me and baby, and can have some long-term neurological side effects if taken continuously.  I found when I stopped taking reglan, my milk supply dropped off again.  No way was I taking it again after the tummy aches my baby had the first time, and certainly wouldn't take it continuously for the next several months until I reach my goal of one year.  So I started taking fenugreek.  It does the trick and I feel safe continuing it as long as needed.  And I think I am the only one who can smell the maple syrup (anyway, I am the only one sticking my nose in my armpits).  Don't worry about it!

review/summary: Works (but not miracles...)
review/text: I noticed an increase of milk production after a week of taking this supplement.  I take four capsules three times a day along with blessed thistle (3 capsules, 3 times a day).  Previously, I pumped four times a day and got 12 ounces in total; now I get about 15 ounces.  The maple syrup smell is not overwhelming but it is easy to feel a bit light-headed and nauseous from the effects on your blood sugar levels so I make sure to take my supplements after a meal.  I also notice that the more water I drink and the healthier I eat during the day, the more milk I yield in general.  Despite the good and the bad, I will continue my pill-popping regiment because every ounce of milk for my baby is precious.

review/summary: THANK GOD FOR FENUGREEK!
review/text: I was adament about breast feeding my baby. Everything was fine while I was at home, I had no problems breast feeding. But when I had to go back to work, I wasn't getting much through pumping. I made sure to drink plenty of water and ate enough fruits and veggies. But I guess some women don't produce a whole lot. I tried the Mother's Milk Tea first before ordering the herbs. I took if for a week and didn't notice a thing. I was depressed bc I didn't want to supplement but the demand was more than the supply!! I ordered the Fenugreek and the Blessed Thistle. I read other reviews saying to take both so I thought, mindaswell. After 1 day I was producing more! Before I would pump and get 1oz. from one side and maybe nothing from the other. Now, I get 3-4oz. from each side per sitting(pumping) And while at work I try to pump every 2 hours. It's hard bc I am a hairstylist and usually very busy. But I could care less what anyone says! I have to feed my child, so I go in the back and pump. I do take 2 of each pill 3 times a day. I do have to get up in the middle of the night and pump to relieve myself. I'd say if you don't want to have to do that, skip the 3rd dose! But my son usually gets up once anyways to eat so I just pump what I can. Hope this helps!!! It helped me so much. :)

review/summary: Worked Well Initially
review/text: I am 40 and just had my son 5 months ago.  Started having trouble with my milk supply around the 5 or 6 week mark - due to a few different issues.  Didn't discover this until a few weeks after than and took 2 pills three times a day and drank lots of water.  It immediately increased my supply.  Over time, however, my supply has decreased again even with continued use (went back to work so I am no longer able to breastfeed/pump every 4 hours - only every 6-8 now).  I must admit that I think the Fenugreek is the only reason I am even pumping the 12-16 ounces a day that I get now.  I am now going to try combining the Fenugreek with Blessed Thistle as some other users have posted about.  Hopeful it will increase my supply again.

review/summary: Not sure it worked for me for increasing lactation
review/text: Everyone said to try Fenugreek to increase lactation.  I took it several (3-4 times) per day for about 5 days.  I didn't notice any increase.  Maybe it is just my system.  The label, interestingly, does not claim to improve lactation.  Maybe it is just a popular wives tale that it does.

review/text: It worked for me since the first day I started to use it, I was getting 30 ml everytime, but with fenugreek increased about 20 to 40 ml more, wasnt a LOT of milk, but i can say it worked.  I added a tea (Mother's milk) and now my milk supply is even bigger, so i guess, pills plus tea works even better than only fenugreek pills, good luck

review/summary: A let down
review/text: I got these because I have heard about them from a lot of breastfeeding Moms. I used them for a month and noticed a very tiny increase in my supply, but for the entire month my baby pooped 6-8 times a day. She was fussy and always blowing out her diapers. I didn't make the connection at first and then decided to stop taking them, after a day she went back to pooping normally and wasn't as fussy.<br />I was taking 2 capsules, 3 times a day. I barely noticed an increase in supply and it made my daughter very gassy and uncomfortable. I was really hoping this would help but it just didn't work for me.

review/summary: Have noticed an increase.
review/text: Fenugreek works for some moms and doesn't for others. I find it utterly amusing that women talk about smelling like maple syrup while taking the supplement!! I haven't noticed that - either I'm used to it or my husband is too nice to tell me, or he has noticed and likes it! I was making just enough to feed my little one, and now I regularly pump 1-2 ounces AFTER he eats AND I pump in between feedings and get an ounce or so.. That doesn't sound like a lot but it adds up and I've started quite the nice freezer stash. I'm not honestly sure if it was the fenugreek that has done it or if my body just started producing more because my diet is great and I stay hydrated.. But since fenugreek is a hell of a lot cheaper than the Motherlove products and not as annoying with the restrictions about drinking around taking the pills, I'm just gonna keep taking them!<br />Also, I have had no problems with gassiness in baby.

review/summary: Great help when needed!
review/text: I did some researching on how to increase my milk production and after reading several of the promising reviews for this Fenugreek, I thought I'd give it a try since it was so affordable. I am a very skeptical person, and was very surprised when I did notice more milk after just the first 2 days. I at first took the recommended 2 capsules 3 times a day. My daughter who was almost 3 months old, didn't seem to be affected by it and I seemed to be able to keep up production. I stopped taking them after about a week. Then when I would notice my milk going back down or my daughter seeming more hungry than usual, I popped 3 capsules just a little while before needing more supply and saw that it helped to do that just once a day. It has been wonderful that I can stop taking it and then take it when needed and know that it will work. I did notice the maple smell in my sweat and urine though, but that's something I can deal with knowing I'm able to feed my daughter without having to supplement with formula. Never noticed any other side effects. Now I just take them every few days as needed. Definitely worth trying if you are feeling the urge to supplement or give up breastfeeding altogether because of low production or just can't keep up with baby. Now if they can just come up with something to make both breasts produce equally!!

review/text: I used this for a month, but not sure that it really helps me. When my baby started to burp up milk, I stopped using it to eliminate the cause. I have not gone back to using the fenugreek because I now have more milk than when I was taking the fenugreek. Hence, I am not sure whether this helps or not, but I would not discourage people from using it since many of my friends have used it with successful.

review/summary: Definitely Happy
review/text: I'm a guy and as most guys, I appreciate bigger boobs. My girlfriend, who I have been dating since high school for a little over 4 years now, was a little unhappy in that department and wanted a little change. Before considering surgery, we decided to give some natural methods a try. After doing some research, we narrowed down some of the most commonly found ingredients in those super expensive pills and began to look for them on amazon.com. Since she had tried some breast enhancement pills before, which didn't work, we decided that she would be better off using only the herbs and stuff that was medically proven to work and give results. Here is what we picked out.....<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VOJ7S0">Ainterol Pueraria Mirifica 500Pure Breast Capsules (100 caps)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00024D9AW">Wild Yam Root 180 vcaps</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009ETA6W">Nature's Way Fenugreek Seed 610 mg, Capsules 180ea</a><br />These are the ingredients that we sort of liked and decided to give them all a try. So I guess this review is for all three of them at the same time. She has been taking them for just over two months now and we both agree that we have seen a change. Her bust has grown by a little over two inches and her breasts definately fell and have more fullness to them. She is a lot more confident and says that her shirts sit on her much nicer. Now she has an extra excuse to spend a ton of money shopping for new clothes, but what can I say, I just love her. A little bit of caution, there are a couple of changes that happened after she started to take the combination of all three of those pills. Her natural body smell has changed a little, nothing negative of course or she would have stopped taking them, but it has altered just a little. And she sometimes complains that her boobs are a little sore. But there has been a significant size difference and I believe that this stuff works. Good luck to you ladies and guys remember to love your women, they're just as sensitive about their boobs as we are about our penises!

review/summary: Worked well for us!
review/text: I read many diverse reviews for this product, but I believe it only works if you use it properly. I learned that it not only about taking a pill, you got to make sure you eat extra food and drink extra liquids. Also timely pumping or breastfeeding is very important too. I noticed, as soon I'd start extracting or taking pills at different times, milk amounts would start messing up. So I started pumping 4 times a day, every 6 hours, day or night, and it became stable and enough for a baby. It is truth that pills give a gas, not only baby, but I was gassy too, but I started taking smaller dose than written on package, 4 pills a day- every time I'd pump. Supply was still good, but a baby wasn't as gassy. Later on as she got bigger, it was unnoticeable, rather I'd say it was due to a food (pickles, cabbage, etc). Most importantly, I believe breast feeding was more valuable over gas issue. I've met so many women who were just too lazy to give their babies what is best for them.

review/summary: Fenugreek + other doctor-prescribed tips to increase milk supply
review/text: I had to get medical therapy to increase my milk supply for twins. Fenugreek was prescribed and it made a huge difference. Based on what the doctor told me you can try the following if you have twins or simply need to increase your milk supply:<br /><br />* Fenugreek is very helpful, 2 capsules three times a day with meals, eventually working your way up to 4 capsules per meal. The body gets used to it after a while so the doctor suggested going off it for a couple of days and restarting.<br /><br />* Nurse 8-12x a day, putting each baby to breast until they empty it (do not time it) - the baby is much more effective than the pump at drawing the milk out than even a hospital pump, and will help increase your supply. In effect, interrupting the feeding could be counterproductive.<br /><br />* You can decrease the # of sessions if the amount pumped is more than 1000 ml/ 24 hrs (try pumping instead of nursing for one day to measure). You can also try weighing the baby to calculate intake, using a baby scale in grams (same as mls for calculating). Note - this will be a rough estimate as the baby may be getting more milk than the pump - and some women are unable to pump much even if they can nurse well.<br /><br />* Alternate sides for the babies, as one may have a stronger suck. It's possible one side will have a lot more milk than another. How you hold the baby also affects supply - if you're right handed that side will hold the baby more firmly and they may nurse longer and increase supply more on that side. All normal.<br /><br />* After breastfeeding the baby, pump but only for 5 minutes or so to increase demand on your body and thus milk production. Frequency is much more important than duration. Pumping for 20 min has little effect according to the doctor (I know, "now I find out?!" that's what I said)<br /><br />* If you have twins, read the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0976896931">Mothering Multiples: Breastfeeding and Caring for Twins or More! (La Leche League International Book)</a> by Karen Kerkhoff Gromada. I wish I had read this early on. It provides solid advice on breastfeeding multiples plus a whole lot more up to 2 yrs of age.<br /><br />* Try to eat well and sleep at least 6 hrs. Your milk production is directly related to your health and stress levels.<br /><br />* If you're able to breastfeed exclusively great but if you can't don't beat yourself up over it it's Ok to supplement (we used Enfacare as my babies were low weight, then Enfamil Premium for one and Alimentum for our other). You have a lot on your hands to worry about.<br /><br />* Don't try to do all feedings alone, you'll go crazy. Have your hubby do the last feeding of the night 10 or 11 pm and the early morning one (6 or 7 am) - you do the ones in between. This way, you'll each get a solid chunk of sleep. The one who's not "on shift" stays in the quiet bedroom without a monitor but with a cell phone. We had an extra bed in the nursery so it would be easier to nurse the babies - if I needed help (two babies crying at the same time or you're too tired) I'd call my hubby on the cell phone, but this rarely happens if you stage feedings (always feed twin A first for example). My hubby comes in at 6 am or whenever and quietly feeds the babies before they wake up so I can sleep until 8 or so.<br /><br />* I kept my energy and supply up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQDDYE">Ensure Plus - Vanilla</a> and oatmeal.<br /><br />* Google "manual expression Stanford University", the video shows how to increase your milk supply significantly using manual expression. It works better than any other method even if it feels unusual.<br /><br />* If you do supplement and trying to increase breastfeeding, don't stop bottle feeding cold turkey (you may not have enough milk supply as supplementing may lower supply). Continue to supplement and give 1 oz or so BEFORE starting to nurse. The reason for this is that bottlefed babies are used to a faster flow and ready supply, with nursing it takes longer for the milk to let down. Giving the bottle-fed baby some formula before nursing will take the edge off his hunger and keep him from "chomping away at the bit" if you will - in other words it will calm him down and make the nursing experience more relaxing for mom & baby and allow baby to nurse longer.<br /><br />* Try a brief warm shower or use warm compresses (try putting warm water in a diaper) before nursing to stimulate milk let down.<br /><br />* Keep your eyes off the clock. Another reason to not interrupt or time breast feeding - the hind milk that lets down after the baby has been nursing a while is richer and higher in fat, more satisfying for the baby. If you stop after "X" minutes you may not get the hind milk.<br /><br />* Continue nursing 8-12x a day - don't wait too long before feedings (4+ hrs), any sign of engorgement is letting your body know there's less demand and will reduce milk production. Nursing every 2-3 hours is better, allow a stretch of 4 hours early in your sleeping cycle to feel better rested (have your hubby feed baby late at night).<br /><br />* Pump for a few minutes each time you nurse to simulate increased demand and boost milk production. Manual milk expression and fenugreek will also help and over time you'll need to supplement less as your milk production increases.<br /><br />* Don't do marathon pumping. As soon as you start feeling stressed or find yourself wondering how many ounces you've pumping, etc. you're overthinking things and this will affect your milk supply. Stop for a few minutes and go do something else. Then pump a little more. You can leave it out at room temperature while you do this - mark the time you started & date on tape w/ a Sharpie pen to be safe. If you wait 15-30 min or so, it counts as an additional pumping session (if you're trying to fit more in).<br /><br />* Pumping is not always a good indicator of your real milk supply (some women may not be able to pump much but nurse well) - a baby scale is the most accurate measurement if you really want to know (don't stress this too much, just nurse until baby seems full).<br /><br />* Feed on demand and expect cluster feeding (every 1-2 hrs) at the witching hour and just before a growth spurt.<br /><br />* For me at least I always had to supplement with twins because I never had enough milk for two. I did see a huge increase in my milk supply from very little to being able to nurse one baby full time for a while. Fenugreek was a HUGE help.<br /><br />Lastly, this tip from a sleep doctor - to handle sleep deprivation log how many hours total you slept at night (even if interrupted), find the midway point and add 12 hours. Try to take a 30-60 minute nap then, this is your natural down-time according to your inner clock and will be much better than trying to catch up on sleep on the weekends (example - slept 12am -6 am, midway point is 3 am add 12 hrs - try to nap @ 3 pm.) Keep a log of how long you sleep each time - always try to get at least 6 hrs.<br /><br />With Fenugreek, enough sleep, a good diet and the tips above, your milk supply should increase.

review/summary: Excellent resource for increasing your milk supply
review/text: My milk supply began to decrease significantly after I started back to work (my son was about six month's old at this time). I took -- and still take, 3 tablets of fenugreek and blessed thistle each per day at least twice a day. If I am not able to pump, I add another round of the herbs and let my son nurse more, to keep my milk supply going strong. This is a wonderful blessing to know that my milk supply can easily be reestablished, if stress, schedule or other factors inhibit our desire to feed the old fashion way! Five stars for fenugreek (and blessed thistle, too!) As a side note, the lactation nurses have told me, that these herbs do lower your blood sugar, so they should be taken with food. I say that from experience. All in all, it more than met my expectations.

review/summary: Fenugreek seed for diabetics
review/text: My mom takes fenugreek seed daily to control her blood sugar level. It works well and she has been able to reduce her dosage of Glucophage.<br />The use of fenugreek for treating diabetes has been scientifically validated (you can read abstracts by doing a keyword search on www.pubmed.gov ).<br /><br />My mom gets it from the Indian grocer where it is much cheaper, though loose and not encapsulated.

review/summary: From someone who took it for months and stopped
review/text: I was taking Fenugreek along with Alfalfa and mothers milk tea for months to increase my supply and I the combo had. Then my baby became very gassy and making our lives miserable. I suspected everything from my food to the supplements. I tried cutting different foods then reintroducing them and no change. Finally I decidedvto read up in the supplements and found that in 20% of babies Fenugreek causes gas and/or fussiness.<br /><br />So the next day I stopped taking it. Now 1 week has passed and not only has my baby's gassiness gone away I oddly feel that I have more milk.<br /><br />I'm sure this works for some so can't say it's bad. Just be aware that this can happen.

review/summary: This kept me going!
review/text: I had to decrease my baby's feedings when I had to return to work 8 weeks postpartum. Eventually, my hectic schedule and numerous illnesses made me stop. My son is now 3 months and I have been feeling incredibly guilty about stopping, so I'm attempting to relactate. I only had about 2 drops of milk from each side, but after almost a week of Fenugreek (9 pills a day), I'm noticing more droplets and an occasional squirt. I find that incredibly impressive. Without this, and my pump, I would have given up and felt guilty for the rest of my life.

review/summary: Helps to boost male libido
review/text: Fenugreek has been so typecast as a way to facilitate lactation that most guys would never dare to think of it for themselves--much less actually try it. The fact that it contains phyto-estrogens just complicates things further if you're concerned about testosterone levels. But sometimes things that look a bit crazy seem to work out well in unexpected ways.<br /><br />I started using fenugreek a year ago, discontinued it because of the testosterone concerns, and recently restarted it to help moderate anxiety symptoms from a choline-related medication I had just started. Since fenugreek's action appears analogous in many ways to oxytocin (a hormone closely related to empathy and the mitigation of fear/anxiety responses), I thought it might help to defuse these reactions. It was at least worth a shot.<br /><br />It does seem to have helped with the anxiety reactions (I combined it with l-glutamine for those who are really interested). What surprised me completely was the very strong boost in libido that I experienced inside of three days. And when I went back and doublechecked the research on fenugreek, I found that a mid-2011 report by Australian researchers showed a 25 percent increase in male libido for those using fenugreek. So objective research says this effect of fenugreek is real. Subjectively, I know that this supplement is way more effective for me than things like saw palmetto that are commonly marketed for libido boosts.<br /><br />And I wasn't even looking for this effect. But it works, and this is one of those side-effects that's a keeper. Beyond this, fenugreek is commonly used around the world by both sexes to help with type 2 diabetes. It appears to help with blood-sugar levels, but I can't say definitively that it works. It's inexpensive enough to be worth trying.<br /><br />My hoped-for long-term use for fenugreek is actually to help with what Buddhists call metta meditation, that is, focusing on lovingkindness. Research by the Center for Affective Neuroscience at the University of Wisconsin suggests that expert meditators on lovingkindness modulate the functioning of the amygdala, a component of the brain that helps to establish empathic reactions and, once again, is closely associated with oxytocin. My experience so far is that fenugreek does in fact help with empathy. This makes eminent sense. Lactation and mother-child bonding pretty much go hand in hand.<br /><br />If you're interested in the underlying neurophysiology, you can probably do a much better job than me in researching this. If you're just a guy who could use a shot in the arm for lovemaking, then this is a worthwhile supplement even if we can't figure out all the physiology involved. Even if none of the above effects interests you, fenugreek is used for and may help with many other things, such as digestion (see Wikipedia for more information on such uses).<br /><br />I hope some of this proves helpful.

review/summary: It got my milk flowing.
review/text: I wanted to switch my baby to formula, but it gave her gastrointestinal problems. I then decided to switch back to breastfeeding. I had only stopped for about a week, but my milk supply had significantly decreased. I was producing about 2 oz every 3 hours. (My baby has a cleft palate so I exclusively pump. Because of this I am aware of exactly how much milk I am producing.) I ordered the Fenugreek (which arrived surprisingly fast)and started taking it immediately. The bottle suggests taking 1-2 pills 3x a day with food. I started off with that dosage while increasing my pumping sessions. I did not notice a huge difference at first. I read on other message boards that most women take 3 pills 3x a day. I increased my dosage. After about a week of Fenugreek at the higher dosage plus an increase in pumpings, I noticed a huge difference. I would get approx 6oz every 3 hours. My first pump in the morning around 5am I normally get about 10oz! My freezer is now full of milk and my supply has stayed consistent. I now pump for 20 min every 4-5 hours, with an 8 hour break at night. My milk supply has not diminished and I am confident it is the Fenugreek.<br /><br />I have not had any negative reactions or experienced any maple smell that some women have mentioned. I have not experienced any side of that can be attributed to Fenugreek. The only downside is that since I take 9 pills a day the bottle doesn't seem to last very long. However, Fenugreek is super cheap so buying more isn't really an issue for me.

review/summary: Worth a Try.
review/text: Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: I needed to buy new bras!
review/text: I was really skeptical at first. A lot of doctors refute any evidence that herbs like fenugreek can improve breast size. After the first day, my breasts started to feel heavier, fuller, and more firm. I started at an A-cup and even with inconsistent use (maybe 2 capsules a day or less), I was reaching toward a C-cup at the end of a couple months or so. I would highly recommend this product, cause it also helps with constipation too. I stopped taking it orally because I noticed my thighs getting a bit bigger too along with my breasts. So at the moment I'm gonna try making a rub out of it so I can just focus the interaction of the fenugreek on my breasts alone through direct massage.

review/summary: Works great!
review/text: I've been using Fenugreek for about 2 weeks now.  I LOVE IT!  It works great.  I bought Fenugreek because I'm a working mom who pumps 2-3 times a day at work. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to keep up with my babies needs because my first 2 weeks back at work the baby ate more at daycare than I could pump.  Within a few days of taking the Fenugreek I was pumping more than he was eating.  I no longer have fears that I'll have to supplement with formula.
