review/summary: Didn't like it, Wrong one
review/text: I had bought Nestle Dark Chocolate in a single box at local store and loved it.  Then on Amazon, I saw the 50-count, 2-pack size and the outside of the box in the picture also said "Dark Chocolate" so I ordered it.  Much to my surprised, it was awful, and the ingredients were different too.  It showed up as "Dark Hot" when I ordered it but I went by the picture online and thought it was just a different name for differentiating it from the regular single boxes of Dark Chocolate.  Nope.  Tasted awful and I ended up embarrassingly giving one box to the needy Food Bin and gave the other opened box to some people at work.  Not the same thing at all even though it says "Dark Chocolate" (still does), it is NOT the same as the single box of Dark Chocolate with 8 envelopes sold in pack of 12.  I will not buy the actual one I like at Amazon as the price is about the same as my local store.  But if you like the Dark Chocolate generally sold as 8 packets in a box, be aware it is NOT the same thing as the 50-count box labelled Dark Chocolate on the outside.

review/summary: Sucralose
review/text: Another non-diet food with artificial sweetener.  I tasted the bitterness of the sucralose, checked the label and sure enough,it was there at the end.  The first ingredient is SUGAR, why ruin it?  Skip this unless you're not on a diet, love sucralose, and not a chocolate lover.  Gross.

review/summary: Terrible - Tastes nothing like store bought product
review/text: I had been purchasing this product for several months at our local grocery store.  The product became unavailable and I couldn"t find it anywhere.  Someone mentioned Amazon so I searched and found it at a decent price.  However, after receiving it and having a cup -  it TASTED nothing like the store bought product.  It tastes exactly like milk chocolate not the dark chocolate it is suppose to be.  There is no way this is the same product - whether its an error in packaging or just a different product I'm not sure.  Now I'm stuck with 100 packs of cocoa that I do not want.  Beware !!!

review/text: Makes a great cup of sugar free-fat free 25 calorie hot cocoa!  It's not quite as "rich" a product as some of  the gourmet cocoas, but for those of us on restricted diets, it's a really good product. I like the canister because it's convenient and pretty much spill proof.  I took the little single serving packets on vacation and they just don't travel as well as the canister.  PS Add a dash of cinammon or maybe a little almond flavoring if you feel like having a gourmet cocoa!

review/summary: The best hot cocoa I've ever tasted
review/text: This is, quite simply, the best hot cocoa I've ever tasted.  Being a self-admitted chocoholic, I've tasted a LOT of hot cocoa.  I even prefer Nestle's Double Chocolate Meltdown to pricier choices like Godiva or Ghirardelli.  This cocoa is smoother and more chocolaty than anything else I've found out there.  I highly recommend it.

review/text: I have been desperately trying to find something to replace the "non-dairy" creamers which I had grown accustomed to in my morning cup of coffee.  I just can't drink coffee without some added sweetening.<br /><br />Then I came across this product!  I can put one tablespoon (and a dash of cinnamon) in my coffee, and I'm good to go.  Easily 60 or more calories less per cup than I was previously drinking.

review/summary: best on the market
review/text: Every morning, I have hot chocolate mixed with instant coffee and some cinnamon. This is a great choice because it is only 25 calories a packet, with 30% of your daily calcium requirement. I tried the similar product by Swiss Miss, but it doesn't dissolve fully like this one does, it leaves big clumps on the side of the cup and sediment on the bottom so I was very happy to go back to this one, even though it's more expensive, because it dissolves very well and has a great taste.<br /><br />It's great that Amazon carries this by the case. It's cheaper than buying it at my local grocery here in California, however, when I lived in New England it was cheaper at the local store. I was thinking the only thing that would make it better would be if they sold it in cannisters so I wouldn't have to deal with all these little packets and boxes, and I just noticed today that Amazon HAS THIS in cannisters now. Woohoo!

review/summary: MMMMM....Chocolate....
review/text: I order this product about every 2 months, I usually order the Rich Milk Chocolate (pack of 3) 27.7 oz canister. I use the mix in my coffee every morning and my kids enjoy a cup every evening when it is cold outside. It's pretty hard to find it in the canisters where I live and I prefer that to the packets that are sold, so this is a good buy for me. The product always arrives intact, no dents or spilled cocoa in the box. I don't know if I would try the other flavors since I like the Rich Milk Chocolate one so far.

review/summary: Good, but Amazon has the flavor names wrong
review/text: Flavor names vs flavor photos are pretty confusing. I ordered "Rich Chocolate" and received "Rich Milk Chocolate". Now that I tasted it it's fine and I realize it's very possible that Nestle stopped making Rich Choc and started these Rich Milk / Rich Dark items, but Amazon should really fix the flavor names so that it's clear what you're getting.

review/summary: Best "chocolately" hot chocolate
review/text: I agree that this is the best hot chocolate that I've ever had.  Most other flavors and brands are either too watery or not chocolately enough.  Unfortunately, as of Jan. 2010, it looks like Nestle has stopped making this.  It is no longer shown on their website.  I've tried their new "Dark Chocolate" flavor and it is too bitter for my taste.  It is NOT a replacement for the Double Chocolate Meltdown.  I encourage everyone to call Nestle and ask them to bring back this flavor!  And if future reviewers care to suggest other similar brands, that would be helpful.  Without the Double Chocolate Meltdown, I may never drink hot chocolate again (and I really need it on cold days; I'm not a coffee drinker).

review/text: My husband and I are not big coffee drinkers. We find in the morning it is much needed, but......ONLY IF......we have this NESTLE FAT FREE cocoa powder mix as the sweetner. We don't use creamer, milk, or sugar, but love this as the sweetner. We are both watching our weight and find this wonderful as it has very few calories, low sugar, and no fat. If you haven't tried it in coffee, you really should. Our local grocery store we shop had not had it for a few weeks. I was almost out, and couldn't find it. I went on line to Amazon, and not only found it, but found it in the canister, and cheaper than buying all the individual packets. We like this better because you can scoop and measure easier. I would highly recommend this product, just save some for me. Can't live without it now! I'm hooked! Hope you enjoy too.<br /><br />Sonya Hamilton

Of course I love it as it is, but this combo is my favorite.<br /><br />And I will be happy to answer M "M" about why.  This is four (4) canisters so it's not that expensive.  The other reason, besides it is good, is that those grocery stores you speak of don't have it. It has become very hard to find.  I can't find it at all any longer and am very happy to order a supply at Amazon.

review/text: I have long loved this hot cocoa but each year it gets harder and harder to find. Amazon's price is quite the bargain.<br /><br />Like a review posted upthread, I have tried several different hot cocoas including Ghirardelli and Godiva, both of which are great. However, this cocoa is my fave. I love the Butterfinger flavor and it really does taste like they dropped the candy bar in your mug. Because of Amazon's economical price, I am a little more willing to share this product at work and I must say, everyone has fallen in love with it.

review/summary: Good hot cocoa mix, but....
review/text: I usually buy Nestle's Hot Cocoa Mix in the Milk Chocolate flavor.<br />This time, I decided to try the Dark Chocolate flavor which we've<br />never had before.  My husband loves dark chocolate in all its forms,<br />but I never really cared for it.  Well, I still don't.  This is a<br />flavorful hot cocoa, but I think it's much sweeter than the Milk<br />Chocolate flavor yet not as chocolate-y; not as creamy.  This flavor<br />is OK and the price was good at Amazon so we'll use it up but I'll<br />go back to the Milk Chocolate flavor the next time I order.<br />By the way, we've tried every popular brand of hot cocoa mix and<br />Nestle's wins, there's no contest.  After all, as they say,<br />"Nestle's makes the very best - chocolate".

The texture and taste of the cocoa in the smaller cans is nowhere near as good as the cocoa we have previously ordered.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Vernon Aune

review/summary: YUMMY!
review/text: YUMMY.<br /><br />I have been drinking this cocoa mix for many years.  Because it is fat free and has low sugar content, I am able to include hot chocolate in my low-calorie food plan.  Recently, I have begun mixing it with a mixture of milk and chicory coffee, to make a delicious mocha drink.  It's a lot cheaper and better than a coffee house drink!  Ordering it in bulk from Amazon.com, makes it an even better bargain.

review/summary: Nestle's Hot Chocolate Disappeared!
review/text: I had been purchasing these large cans of Nestle's Hot Chocolate all through last winter and even the summer months at my local grocery store. In the fall they stopped carrying the item.  I checked at several grocery stores with the same results.  I was surprised to see Amazon had the item. I placed my order and it arrived within the week. Very satisfied with the item and the service I received.

review/text: I was so excited when I found amazon selling the Nestle Hot Chocolate.  We used to purchase it at our local stores but they only carried it seasonally and then this last year they quite carrying it altogether.  It was very disappointing.  It is a far better product than the Swiss Miss Diet Hot Chocolate.  As someone who does Weight Watchers it also works great with my diet as one beverage is no points.  Thank you Amazon for carrying this product and Thank you Nestle for continuing to make it.

review/text: I also LOVE this stuff!!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, I believe Nestle's has stopped making it.<br /><br />I actually wrote them TWO letters.  They replied that the sales numbers weren't strong enough to warrant the continued production of it.<br /><br />I just can't believe this.  I think they simply tried to re-tool their formulas for some unknown reason.<br /><br />In my opinion, they should have stuck to the old adage:  "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  Because they did, and none of their new products compare to this flavor--I have tried several of the competitors also--still searching!

review/text: We made batches of hot chocolate for the people walking down our street looking at the neighborhood Christmas lights. Everyone loved it. The chocolate flavor doesn't overwhelm the taste buds. The best part is that hot water is all that's needed. One note of caution: The person making the hot chocolate must adjust the amount of mix to get good results. She didn't follow the directions on the can, but did a taste test for each batch.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I tried this flavor since Nestle appears to have stopped making my favorite, Double Chocolate Meltdown.  This flavor is not as watered down as the Rich flavor, and for that I'm glad.  However, as a dark chocolate lover and someone who enjoys a true, deep chocolate taste, I was disappointed.  This flavor is more bitter than bittersweet.  It did not satisfy my palette, and it's unlikely that I will purchase any more of the current Nestle hot chocolate flavors.

It seems to be very filling, as they eat less of it than their previous food.  Buy the big bag so it's a little less expensive.  Overall, this is an excellent food, and the cats seem healthy and happy on it.

review/text: I switched to this cat food randomly--Whole Foods was out of the Halo brand cat food I had been buying, and this was the next best option they sold.  I'm really glad I switched though! My 2 cats used to vomit up their food once or twice a week, and never liked the Halo brand food.  The vomiting is way down now, and they both seem to really like this food.  Plus the quality of this cat food is great, which is something I really care about.<br /><br />This 12 lb bag is a great deal.  At whole foods, it's $14 for a 3lb bag!  With the 12 lb bag, I save $22.  Plus with Amazon Prime the shipping was free, so it works out great (even if I paid for shipping though it'd still be saving me money).<br /><br />I really like this food for my cats, and plan to keep using it.

review/summary: Expensive - But great food
review/text: I'm usually the type of person to buy whatever is on sale to give to her cats. But about a year ago my sister had a health scare with her animals and they kept throwing up while eating Purina. We did a lot of research together and learned about the types of food you really SHOULD be giving your cats. Apparently most cat food has main ingredients that would not normally be found in a cat's diet (always check the first three, those tell what the majority of food is made of.) Things like corn and grain are not good for kitties, and they...well to be frank...they eat more, they poop more, and when they DO poop, it's waaaaayyy stinky.<br /><br />A lot of people recommended a variety of brands, and this was one that was actually on the cheaper end, but still had better ingredients. My kitties LOVE it (they love the Wellness in the brown and cream bag more, but this is cheaper.) They eat less cat food and seem to be more satisfied. I calculated how long it takes them to go through a large bag like this versus the cost of it. It costs me about (or a little over) 50 cents a day to feed two kitties. All the protein in it keeps them more full so they eat less of it! I'd say that's not a bad deal. The pieces are pretty small so it's easy for them to chew on. (Sometimes I get kinds that literally would be the size for a smallish dog and not a cat. They have problems eating it and the pieces fall everywhere.)<br /><br />I will continue to buy this kind as long as it remains available.

review/summary: An excellent, high-quality food
review/text: This is an excellent, high-quality cat food. If you want to change to this -- just be aware that anytime you change your cat's food, you have to do so very gradually over about a week's time, mixing the new with the old in gradually increasing amounts. Never just switch from one food to another, or you are asking for stomach upsets. The people who make this food actually recommend feeding a mix of dry kibbles with the canned food, which is how I feed it. I have three Manx cats that I have switched over to this food and they are doing extremely well. Their coats have improved and they have more energy. One of my boys has lost weight on their low-calorie formula and he looks great. My female has stopped scratching herself and her fur has grown back where she licked it off -- I think she had food allergy issues with her old food. My other boy has issues with struvites and was on a prescription diet from the vet. However, the manufacturer even said he couldn't stay on it forever without constant blood testing because it could harm his kidneys! Who wants to feed their cat something that could harm his kidneys?? So far, after several months on Wellness, he's doing great. Their food keeps the Ph of the urine low, which is great for a cat with his problems. So many of the store bought foods are literally full of garbage -- rejected stuff that would be thrown away. Meat by-products contain some pretty horrible stuff. Also, cats are carnivores and need meat -- not cereal, which is a main ingredient in many cat foods. When's the last time you saw a cat in the wild eating corn or meal? Wellness has human grade meat as its main ingredient and also contains healthy veggies.  My two boys are on the Lite formula and my girl is on Adult Super5 Mix. I'm glad a friend told me about it. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Gonna be a lifetime customer!
review/text: I adopted my boy kitty (Boo) about a year and half ago and my girl kitty (Poxie) one and half months ago from the local pound. They both had a clean bill of health without any allergies or problems (other than the occasional hairball) but I started them on this brand after some reasearch because I wasn't happy about the nasties in the old food and how it left dye all around the water bowl (Boo = messy eater, he likes to pick out his food and it ends up all over the place).<br /><br />After a couple months of changing Boo's food, there was less bits of food being flung around and floating in his bowl, there wasn't a brown ring around his drinking fountain and there was even less fur in his foutain (granted, the latter may have more to do with the seasons and shedding).<br /><br />When I took Boo back to the vet about 6 months after changing the food, the Dr. mentioned that he was a bit iffy because it was werid to have fruit in cat food. He also said that he's noticed several cats that have kidney problems after years of eating Wellness (and checked to see if I was feeding them wet food as well - they eat Nutro Max pouches too. However, throughout the whole exam, he commented several times on how Boo's fur was very shiney, full and didn't have any flakes or dandruff like some of the other black cats he's seen.  At the end the Dr., somewhat jokeingly, said "Ok, if his coat is THIS nice, I have to look into this some more and change my mind about the brand!"<br /><br />Poxie was a scruffy looking girl and spent a couple months at the pound before we adopted her. She had just given birth to kittens before being placed for adoption and was spayed ASAP. She had her own room and didn't have to fight for food while at the pound, but she was on the thin side and her fur was dry and had a brittle feeling. She's been eating Wellness for about three weeks now and her coat has already settled down and is more sleek and silkier.<br /><br />So overall, notciable changes in both their coats (as a general indication of their health) and a huge improvement quality/ingredient wise compared to what they were fed at the pound. I have been recommending Wellness to everybody who askes me about my kitties!

review/summary: Cats' favorite
review/text: My cats have sampled almost every healthy food available in the U.S.A., and all 4 of them will eat this one! Before I learned about feline nutrition, I fed my cats dry food and poor quality canned food. Now they won't eat any good quality canned food, or raw diet, and they are addicted to dry food. I still feed them Fancy Feast canned food (it's the only wet food they will eat) and I am happy that I found a good quality dry food that they will eat! I've offered 4 different premium quality dry foods side by side, and the cats prefer this one! They won't touch most healthy foods, so Wellness must have a palatable formula. I recommend this food to anyone with a cat who insists on eating dry food and is finicky!

review/summary: Worth the expense!
review/text: Moses, my 8 year old cat, was having trouble with itching, dandruff, and excessive earwax accumulating in his ears.  His vet suggested that allergies might be the culprit, so before spending hundreds of dollars on allergy testing, she suggested that I switch him to a premium diet (grain-free, if possible).  Switching from a diet of Fancy Feast (aka Kitty Crack) and Friskies was no easy task! He refused to eat Blue Buffalo, Science Diet, and a few other brands of dry food.  For some unknown reason, he's taken a liking to his Wellness Complete Health! It does have a meaty, natural smell and feels slightly oily to the touch.<br /><br />His coat is much shinier, he's dandruff free, and his earwax problem has improved by about 30%.  On the downside, he's gained weight.  My vet said that this food is higher in calories than most other brands, so you'll want to be sure your cat isn't overeating.  Also, I've found that if Moses's diet isn't supplemented with wet food, he gets constipated (which was diagnosed by the tiny balls of poop that stick to his butt or end up around the house).  This was never a problem before he started eating this brand, so beware.

He won't eat any wet food now, but I feel good that he's eating this (and I syringe him some wet food just in case - with some supplements for his liver.)<br /><br />The other cats are doing GREAT, and I recommend this food to anyone.

review/summary: Litter box smell could gag a skunk
review/text: Switched my non-diabetic (I have one diabetic on wet only for the past year) cat from EVO to Wellness Complete (blue bag) in an attempt to save $ while still providing good nutrition for the fur baby. Ever since starting the Wellness food his litter box has had the most foul odor I have ever smelled in a litter box. Visitors can definitely tell I have pets!! Heck, they probably think I'm secretly hoarding zoo animals. This hasn't been a problem before and I had really been hoping this was a temporary thing but we're almost three months into a bag and there's been no let up. We're finally getting to the last of the bag and I'm going to start switching him back to the EVO because I literally can't take it anymore. I'm quite frankly shocked that no one else has complained about this.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />PROs:<br />Pretty solid nutrition<br />Cat seems to really like the taste<br />Cheaper than other holistic brands<br /><br />CONs:<br />Twice a day it smells like raw sewage all through-out my house.

review/text: So far, my cats appear to like this food. While I'm against feeding cats dry cat food, this food appears to be balanced in ways that other dry foods are not. From some reviews that I've read about this food, most people agree that it's a better quality dry food and made without many of the by-products. The only issue I have with it is the cost. Yep, it's much higher than others but I'd rather pay a higher cost and know that my kitties are getting a better quality food. Look forward to trying some of the wet food as well.

review/summary: My cats eat it...begrudgingly
review/text: As with anything, one cat's trash is another cat's treasure (or something like that).  I have been experimenting with various canned and dry cat foods for my 2 cats (one is a 9 month old kitten and the other is a 3 year old).  They're generally not picky eaters, but when I decided a few months ago to switch them from Purina Indoor Cat food and Purina One Kitten Chow to higher quality cat foods, I did a considerable amount of research.<br /><br />I started them off with Evo Turkey & Chicken food, which they seemed to love at first.  At some point after I opened the second bag of Evo, they started to turn their noses up at meal time.  Not only that, I also noticed what some other Evo reviewers have said: that their breath and poo were very stinky.  My kitten loves to cuddle and my acute sense of smell just made that experience unbearable, to say nothing of litter duty.<br /><br />So onward to other options.  I figured I'd try the other highly touted Wellness brand.  Perhaps I should have predicted that they would hate this brand cat food since I had previously bought Wellness cat treats, which they will.not.eat.  I mean, they don't refuse much, but they refuse those treats.  But, since I wanted to stick with a high quality brand, I decided to try Wellness.  My cats eat it, but only do so begrudgingly and it's clear they do not enjoy it.  I have had to resort to mixing in canned food to make it more palatable until the bag is finished.  Oh, and their breath is still nauseating -- a different kind than with Evo, but still very noticeable.<br /><br />I suppose it's just as well; I was planning to switch them to canned food eventually, which they love.  The problem now is that I will have to start another hunt for the right canned food because I can't tell if the options I'm offering now are just being devoured because they actually like the flavor or if it's just better than the Wellness.<br /><br />Bottom line: as with any new pet foods, buy a small quantity before committing to it.  Especially when you're paying a premium.

review/summary: Made Cat Sick, Cost $200 to Fix, Company Wouldn't Reimburse
review/text: I purchased a bag of WellPet's Wellness Complete Health (blue bag) dry cat food at a local pet store.  I wanted to bring my experience to your customer's attention so that others won't have the same problem.  The food caused my cat to have a serious urinary tract infection that required a vet visit and special food to cure.  The total cost to me in out of pocket un-reimbursed expenses was close to $200.  I contacted Well Pet several times to request reimbursement, but they ultimately refused even though my Vet told me that the food was likely the cause of the problem.  Please advise other customers of this potential problem so they don't waste their time and money on the product, or cause their pet to become painfully sick.

Green peppercorns are picked when under-ripe. White pepper is black pepper which has been soaked to remove the outer husk. Tellicherry peppercorns are the largest black peppercorns.<br /><br />Pink peppercorns are not from the Piper Nigrum vine. They are the dried berries of the Baies rose plant grown on the French island of R&egrave;union and make a colorful addition to sauces.<br /><br />The four peppercorn blend is a favorite for this asparagus dish:<br /><br />Four Peppercorn Asparagus<br /><br />1 bunch fresh asparagus<br />2 tsp. extra virgin olive oil<br />Pinch seasoning salt<br />1/8 tsp. freshly ground four peppercorn blend<br />2 tsp. fresh lemon juice<br /><br />Preheat the oven to 425�F. Arrange asparagus in a 13 X 9 X 2-inch baking dish. Sprinkle with oil, salt, freshly ground pepper, and lemon juice. Bake for 15-20 minutes, turning once.<br /><br />Variation: For a vegetable platter, cook spaghetti squash halves in the microwave for 20 minutes or until done. Boil 20 halved baby red potatoes. Drain potatoes, toss with butter, more freshly ground pepper, salt, and dried parsley. Arrange scooped-out spaghetti squash around the edges of an oval platter. Lay asparagus like the hands of a clock. Fill the middle of platter with potatoes. Drizzle with juices from the asparagus.<br /><br />Makes 4 servings or 6 servings for the platter variation.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Well how sweet it is... it not only accelerated the process but helped take some of the sting out of the experience. I did not apply directly into the wound at first....just around the edges. I did this at night, covering up the sticky stuff with a large bandage tapped securely in place & left it on as i slept. After the wound closed i lightly applied it directly on it about every other day for a week.<br />My recovery was quick....so quick i did not need to use allot. Now i am in the next phase of my recovery, scar reduction & physical therapy & doing great. Proper wound management care is essential from day 1 until fully recovered as the better job you do the better your chances of a quick & complete recovery. So if you have your antennas out looking for something above & beeyond your standard remedy i recommend trying this sweet stuff & sticking to it :)

review/text: Traditional bouillon is just loaded with salt. In fact, the cheap grocery store bouillon seems nothing more than a flavored salt cubes.<br /><br />This bouillon is quite different, with only 130 mg (5% DV) per serving (serving size is 1/2 a cube). And to be honest with you, I can't imagine wanting it any saltier. These cubes are bursting with great veggie flavor. Also, these are ideal for low-sodium diets and those who try to limit sodium intake.<br /><br />Four stars because, as another reviewer noted, the cubes don't dissolve as easily as other bouillon. You've really got to boil one on the stove top for best results if you want to make a drink out of it. The extra effort really is worth it, though, in the end.

I prefer the "no salt added" variety so that I can more easily adjust the amount of a salt in a given dish to my own liking. It's convenient to use, though sometimes slow to dissolve in water. I've also tried the Edward & Sons bouillon cubes as well as the Better Than Bouillon mix, both of which dissolve more readily in liquid. That said, the Edward & Sons bouillon becomes sticky and crumbly in hot and humid weather, and Better Than Bouillon is a messy, paste-like mix that comes in small jars which require refrigeration after opening - so overall, Rapunzel wins on ease of use and messiness, or lack thereof. Use it to make vegan vegetable soup, flavored rice, gravy, seasoned veggies and pasta - anywhere and everywhere its nonvegan counterparts might venture. Your imagination's the limit.<br /><br />On the downside, the Rapunzel brand bouillon does contain palm oil (as does Edward & Sons; Better Than Bouillon does not). Palm oil, of course, has been linked to deforestation, habitat loss (such as that of Orangutans and Sumatran Tigers), the oppression of indigenous peoples, and greenhouse gas emissions. I contacted the company to inquire about their sourcing of palm oil, but have yet to receive a reply. Given that the company is somewhat socially conscious, I'm holding out hope that they obtain their palm oil from a sustainable source. Until then, 3/5 stars.
