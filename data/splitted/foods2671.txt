review/summary: Easily Competes with any of the Bottled Mixes
review/text: Crystal Light has entered the market of non-alcoholic mix drinks with the Margarita mix that actually tasting close too a Margarita. For a crystal light product this flavor is well done. I would compare it too some of the bottled pre-mixed Margarita flavors you find in the market. It is not as good as a freshly made real Margarita but will give the bottled mix's a run for their money. And too top it off an eight ounce glass of crystal light has only five calories, The container contains five separate packets that will each make two quarts of the mix. If you love cyrstal light products you will most likely rate this higher for you will be use too their flavored drinks.

review/summary: Not very flavorful, too sweet
review/text: I didn't much care for this product.  I didn't taste much of the margarita flavor at all.  It just tasted like sweetened water.  Plus it has a strange unappealing smell when mixing it up with water.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light mojito and appletini, and those flavors are much better.  I wouldn't recommend this flavor at all.

review/summary: NOT what I expected
review/text: I don't drink anymore. When I did, a margarita was my favorite drink. When I saw this new drink mix, I was expecting to be able to enjoy that distinctive tart bite. That is not what I got.<br /><br />They did a good job with the color. The watery lime color does look like a margarita on the rocks. Unfortunately, I found the taste to be a bit watery too (and as always with drink mixes, I didn't add quite the full amount of water called for at first so that it doesn't end up too watery). The strongest flavor was an artificial bitter tequila flavor. UGH.<br /><br />Others have rated this much higher, and I would think that if you are looking for a low-cal margarita mixer, it might be worth a try, but as for me, I could not even finish the one package, and don't know what I'll do with the other three in the canister.

review/summary: Nice idea but odd tasting
review/text: I like the idea of this product: an alcoholic beverage with no alcohol and one that's just 5 calories. Of course, that's also this products downfall: it's a "mock" beverage meaning you should expect this to be an imitation of the real thing and for the taste to be odd or off. For me, this isn't something I'd buy after sampling it: it has a bit of a kick and an odd aftertaste that simply turned me off after a few sips.

review/text: This is pretty tasty.  I made it one day and wasn't too impressed with it while drinking in ice,  but let it sit i the fridge over night and get really cold and it improved the taste a lot.  It does actually taste quite a bit like margarita mix.  Of course it's not completely like it, but this mix is also guilt free and did satisfy my craving for a margarita.  I enjoyed it a lot.

review/summary: LoCal Margaritaville
review/text: I'm not going to lie--I was more than a little bit skeptical about Crystal light's new lo cal moctail flavors. I worried this would taste like the watery half-inch remnant of a poorly mixed drink left at 2 a.m. in a sad little casino just off interstate I-40. You know, basically tasteless with a side of gross.<br /><br />But WHOA. These are too yummy. They are tasty and appromixate the cocktail taste well enough, sans alcohol, of course. It's not the same as ordering a top shelf Margarita in San Antonio, but it definitely passes the test for me.<br /><br />I've tried both the Margarita and the Mojito flavor and the Mojito is favorite, but I like the tiny hint of salty sweetness in Crystal Light's margarita, too. Forget raspberry lemonade, gimme a five calorie moctail.<br /><br />I like drinking the moctails on ice, but you can also jazz it up and mix it up in the blender with a splash of something extra. Seriously. No kidding. Try it.

I don't drink alcohol and I've never tasted a margarita (that I can recall); and although there was no ticker tape parade in my taste buds over it, for having only 5 calories per serving, it isn't a bad beverage.

review/text: This is the 3rd of the new Crystal Lights that I have tried.  The other two - The Appletini and Mojito were delicious.<br /><br />This one less so.<br /><br />I found the drink had both an odd taste and an aftertaste.<br /><br />Unlike the other two drinks, I have tried mararita's, but don't think this tastes much like one. (Maybe the ones I drank, don't taste like real Margarita's either?)so can only compare to the ones I have had.<br /><br />It does taste a little better when icy cold, but not so much that I would want to drink it again.<br /><br />Everyone has different tastes, so invest in one of these small cans and give it a try, never let someone else's opinion stop you from trying a new product.

review/summary: even trade, taste for low cal
review/text: We love our margaritas, hate the high calories. I first used this in place of our usual bottled mix. The packet went in the blender along with some water, ice, and tequila. The dayglo green was a bit alarming. I found it had an aftertaste of something slightly chemical, but my guest thought it was fine.  With a splash of Gran Gala (my fave add-in to a margarita) it was a bit better. Next I tried it just as any other Crystal Light flavor. It still had an off taste, almost dusty-ish. The Crystal Light flavor I liked best was the pink grapefruit, I think they discontinued it. That was the freshest tasting CL, in my opinion. This Mocktail Margarita was dissapointing...but I think I'll try the Mojito one. If you're willing to trade off some taste for a lower calorie drink, you might like this.

review/summary: Great Alternative For Sugar Free Drinkers
review/text: I served this at a large gathering recently. First, for those who either don't have to watch their sugar or prefer the alcoholic versions, this product is not for you. Those that I served it to who have never tried sugar free drinks or prefer alcohol in their mixes were not impressed. However, those of us who are sugar free drinkers, either by choice or necessity, thought this mix was on the upper side of good. It tastes very limey and *almost* like a margarita. It's a very good sugar free alternative. The color is VERY neon green. For me, it was a tad on the strong side. I think it could make 3-4 quarts (instead of the suggested 2 qt) with the same amount of mix and that is how I will try it next time. I also wonder if it would be better blended like a margarita. The package suggests serving it like punch in a pitcher with ice or cold water and that is how I served it. I think the blended ice would make it even better.

review/summary: I'll pass, thanks
review/text: I avoid sugar so I was excited about this product. This doesn't have sugar added but is still "sweet" tasting...too much.  We prefer a tart margarita, similar to a product on the market that is premixed (has tequila in it already) for the skinny-tastes (you all know which one I mean).  It is just right in sweet/tart for our taste but pricey.  We were hoping that we could use this instead but the taste isn't even close.  When you mix this product with water it does smell like a margarita, that is the only positive comment we can make.<br /><br />Our teens didn't think the taste was bad (virgin), and they didn't mind the green color, but no one finished their serving. We 3 adults had tequila in ours, did not like the color or taste and ended up throwing them out, tequila and all. Sorry! I usually like Crystal Light products, but thumbs down on this one.

review/text: How did they get it to taste like tequilla?  No really, HOW DID THEY?<br /><br />I have no idea, but this drink mix is delicious.  It doesn't taste like margarita mix without the alcohol, it tastes like the real thing--only no alcohol and very few calories (5 per serving).  So delicious and refreshing, it's hard not to drink the entire two quarts in one sitting.  But if you do, don't worry--that's only 40 calories.<br /><br />I might try making it double strength and blending with ice... Oh, I wish it were summer again!

review/summary: Tastes like generic Margarita mix
review/text: Well, it's green. Sort of an electric tree frog green. And opaque. In fact, it looks a lot like bottled margarita mix. And that's pretty much what it tastes like. If you like the taste of low cal margarita mix, you'll probably enjoy this mocktail mix. If you prefer your margaritas with a little more crisp lime-y bite, give this one a pass. I tried it mixed with water and served over ice. Maybe try mixing it with ice in a blender? I'm too lazy to get the blender out for a quick drink and always drink my Margaritas on the rocks.<br /><br />I have also tried the Target 5-calorie Market Pantry on-the-go drink mix in Lime Margarita. It's more transparent (which seems less disturbing somehow) and comes with recipe enhancers right on the box. For example, add fresh lime juice. There's even a recipe for a full fledged Margarita.<br /><br />In comparison, I found the Crystal Light lacking: too artificial tasting with a less than appealing color.<br /><br />PS. For my second batch, I added 1/2 cup of fresh lime juice. I thought that helped, but the only way my husband would drink it was if he dumped in a bunch of grenadine. Also, when the pitcher was empty I noticed that the product left behind a noticeable chalky white substance on the bottom of the pitcher. We won't be finishing off the rest of the mix.

review/summary: It tastes good, just not much like a margarita
review/text: Crystal Light might be better off if they didn't name their drinks after things that you expect to taste a certain way.  I drink a lot of Crystal Light, but it takes a while to get used to the idea that the lemonade flavor doesn't taste like lemonade, for example.<br /><br />I love the idea of the Mocktails.  There are times I'd love to have something that tastes like a margarita, but has no alcohol and no calories.  When I look closely at that statement, well, it's pretty obvious that I'm just not living in the real world.<br /><br />The margarita mocktail has a vague passing resemblance to a very watered-down, inoffensive and politically correct margarita, and I suppose that is, more or less, what it is.  Honestly, I rather like the taste.  I like it better than Crystal Light lemonade and it beats the socks off Crystal Light pink lemonade.  And it is a really lovely color, a pale apple green, rather margarita-colored, when you think about it.<br /><br />Pro:  Tastes nice, few calories, pretty color, no alcohol of course<br />Con: If your taste buds are all primed for a margarita, this drink will not satisfy and you may find yourself adding things like margarita mix and tequila, which kind of misses the point.

review/text: I've purchased these types of sugar-free drink mixes plenty of times, both in the Crystal Light brand and the grocery-store knockoffs. This one -- which I'm drinking right now! -- is flavorful and very pleasant. I haven't been known to turn down a good margarita, so the flavor here is reminiscent in its fruitiness and tang. There's some tartness at first taste, but overall it's pretty mellow and smooth. The color is a cool limey green. It would be nice if this mix utilized Splenda instead of aspartame, because I tend to avoid the slightly more toxic latter, but that's not a huge deal. Interesting to see the mix in pouches instead of the little cups, even though the overall packaging is still a tube.

review/summary: OK but not great.
review/text: Compared to the Mojito Crystal Light Mocktail, this product -- the Margarita Mocktail -- is a disappointment.  The flavors are not clear or intense and it is more like a not too sweet kool-aid than a margarita.  Now, I have to admit that I have strong preferences about margaritas and I prefer them strong and with nothing but tequila, cointreau and real lime juice.  The sweet mixes that are used to make so many margaritas sold in restaurants and bars are not my cup of tea (or margarita!).  For those many who do enjoy the restaurant variety margarita the Crystal Light Margarita Mocktail might be just their cup of tea.  It has the same flavor and if made into a slushy in the blender it would taste very like the frozen margaritas found in restaurants but without the calories.  I would suggest adding less water if you are going to make a slushy since it would be too watered down otherwise.  All in all this is an interesting new product.

review/text: Light and tasty Margarita mix, kind of what I expected from a Crystal Light Product (light tasting, refreshing, pleasant taste).  No sugar is a bonus, and the mix does have a tangy Margarita-like taste.  I'm not a Margarita expert, but this mix tasted similar to full-calorie mixes I have tried in the past.  If you're looking for an intense, really sweet mix, this is not your choice. But if you want a good tasting, low calorie, no sugar alternative that's easy to make, you should give the Crystal Light Margarita mix a try.  You won't be disappointed!

review/summary: Ugh
review/text: Being that I am a diabetic, I love Crystal Light, usually. This mocktail of Margarita was the lone exception. The first thing that hit me upon tearing open the packet and pouring it into my pitcher was the raunchy aroma. Usually the Crystal Light smell is either pleasant or non existing. This Margarita mix smelled horrible. I went ahead and added water and shook vigorously to blend the mix well. I then tasted the concoction: not bad. It does have a nice sweetened lemonade flavor. It does not taste like a cocktail at all though. It does not taste, to me, like a virgin Margarita even, just a blandish, sweet lemonade type of flavor. Then came the gastric distress. Oh no! I drink Crystal Light every day with no ill effects; this concoction, once again, was the sole exception. I'll spare the details, but suffice to say that I am not willing to even test this mocktail again. I am back to my trusty Raspberry, Peach, or Lemon Ice Tea blend. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, but with this stuff there was a small loss to the venture.<br /><br />That's my experience, maybe yours might be better,<br />MLC

It manages to strike a nice balance between tart and sweet, and does not overpower the "adult" portion of the beverage to be added.<br /><br />By the way - it's not a bad alternative to lemonade or ice tea when consumed without alcohol.

review/text: This drink is awful. It reminds me of a cocktail (perhaps a plain margarita) that one has left on the table from a party the night before, where the drink is diluted from the melted ice and the alcohol evaporated away. The drink has a very slight lime flavor and a tinge of sweetness (but less sweet than other crystal light drinks when made according to instructions). It is reminiscent of a plain margarita, so if that is what you seek, you may find it here. But I don't like it, and I ordinarily LOVE Crystal Light. I suggest Sunrise Orange or Iced Tea by Crystal Light, more authentic flavor. Also, the Mojito flavor "mocktail" is not bad, assuming you like subtle mint flavors.

review/text: Oh my goodness...<br />Although I have to give Crystal Lights a thumbs-up for trying to come up with diet water flavorings in more adult flavors (Margarita, Mojito, Appletini or whatever), unfortunately this stuff is just awful!<br /><br />First of all, why would they package this in a pitcher-sized packet?  Do you really think you are going to have a bunch of girlfriends over and serve them a pitcher of Crystal Light non-alcoholic Margaritas?  Why not package it the same way they package all their other Crystal Light products, in individual-sized packets that you can stir into one bottle or glass of water?  The only market I can see for this product is if you should happen to belong to a Weight Watchers/AA group where you need to serve a pitcher of diet "mocktails" to a group of people who are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />Okay, so they missed on the product packaging (and had a misguided focus group)...but what about the taste?  I have to admit that there are some Crystal Light flavors that I do like and enjoy putting into my water.  I'm especially fond of the Pink Lemonade mix.  But this Margarita mix is just awful--the taste is at the same time bland, metallic, sour (and not in a good way), stale-tasting, and leaves a bad aftertaste in your mouth, and (worst of all) tastes nothing like any Margarita I've ever had.  I cannot imagine what they were thinking!  The recipe must have been formulated by people without tastebuds.<br /><br />Believe me, this is not a product you will buy more than once, and take my advice and skip it altogether!

review/text: Let me be clear: I wasn't expecting this to taste like a top-shelf margarita from the local bar... but I was truly surprised by just how nasty this stuff is.<br /><br />Upon opening the packet and pouring the off-white powder into a pitcher, I was immediately greeted by a smell I can only describe as being very similar to dishwasher detergent.  The powder went from off-white to neon green as soon as it came in contact with water, which is sort of fascinating.  As the water poured into the pitcher, the detergent smell became more pronounced, along with what could best be described as the aroma of lemon-scented furniture polish.<br /><br />I gave it a thorough stir and put it in the refrigerator to chill.<br /><br />A few hours later, I poured some into a glass.  The smell was just as strange as before.  I took one sip, and sure enough, it tasted just like it smelled.  I took another sip, hoping my tastebuds would perhaps adjust and that I'd somehow like it... but no dice.  I had to dump it out and grab a soda to get the detergent/furniture polish taste out of my mouth.<br /><br />Long story short, this stuff is foul.

review/text: I love margaritas.  They are a very simple cocktail with a perfect balance of three ingredients; tequila, triple sec, and fresh-squeezed lime juice. And maybe salt. The "fresh-squeezed lime juice" is essential. Anyone who makes margaritas out of a "margarita mix" is missing the whole point of the drink.<br /><br />Considering my distain for margarita mix, I knew I wasn't going to like this "Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita" but curiosity compelled me to give it a try.  How close to an actual margarita could they come?<br /><br />No surprises.  It is pretty nasty.  It tastes nothing like a real margarita, which isn't surprising as two-thirds of a margarita's flavor is alcohol-derived.  This doesn't even taste like anything resembling real fruit.  Everything about the flavor screams that this was conceived in a laboratory and not grown on a tree.  Bleah.<br /><br />This is a drink for people who like "Crystal Light Lemonade," "Kool Aid," and "Sunny Delight."  This is a drink for people who have become so conditioned to artificial flavorings that they don't know the taste of real fruit juice.  As for me, I will continue to make my lemonade out of squeezed lemons, my orange juice out of squeezed oranges, and my margaritas out of tequila, triple sec, and fresh-squeezed lime juice.

review/text: I'm limited in being able to give a highly thorough review, since I had no tequila on hand. :) Nonetheless, for those of us who need to be careful of sugar consumption, the Mocktails Margarita is a rather tasty product. Crystal Light products always have a place on my shelf, and I am happy to have this new variety.

review/summary: Poor as a drink, but great as a mix
review/text: I generally like Crystal Light products. They're low in calories and genuinely taste good without any discernible "diet" taste.<br /><br />I had high expectations when I mixed as directed. The flavor was mellow and bit fruity, but lacked a distinct flavor. Although it's not bad, I wouldn't serve this to drink straight up. There are hundreds of superior powdered drinks.<br /><br />To step up the flavor, I did the only logical thing: add salt, lime, and tequila.<br /><br />That worked well. I was actually impressed by how spot-on the flavor was. The only negative about the drink was visual. It has a radioactive green hue and a cloudiness that I don't generally see in "real" margaritas. I see that more in frozen margaritas ala On the Border or Chili's, but I suspect if it were blended with ice, the flavor would be too watered down. You may have to increase the powder:water ratio if you plan to serve frozen.<br /><br />A single pack makes 2 quarts of mix, which is plenty for a small group.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Though they probably won't admit it, it's clear that this was intended to be served with alcohol. With a splash of good tequila and lime, it's a winner. Boring as virgin drink.

review/summary: Tastes similar to a margarita
review/text: This is a delightful new Crystal Light flavor which actually tastes quite a lot like the margarita mixes you can purchase. You get that "twang" sensation from the very first sip and it even has a hint of a salty flavor to it. I am not a drinker, so I do not mix alcohol with it, but I would imagine that if you do add the alcohol, it would make a pretty flavorful margarita.  It has the proper green coloring to match the more expensive mixes. I would definitely buy this product again, and in fact, have looked for it at the stores. I have not been able to find it yet on the local grocery store shelves. If and when it does become available, I will most definitely be buying it every week. There are five packets in the container, each of which makes two quarts of drink. If it becomes available locally for about the same price as the other Crystal Light flavors, this will be a very economical beverage.

review/text: I've tried another of these Mocktails and didn't like it but this one is great!  I'm diabetic and I don't like most Crystal Light drink flavors but this one is perfectly sweet, not overly.  I've never had an alcoholic Margarita so I can't compare but the flavor of this is great!  Even my kids like it.  I'd definitely buy this again.  Can't wait til they sell this in our local store but for now I'll just have to buy it here, price is probably better anyway.

review/text: I'll preface this review by stating that I can't stand tequila.  As such, I'm not a big margarita drinker in general.  However, Crystal Light has done a fairly okay job with replicating all the good things about a Margarita without adding the tequila.<br /><br />My wife, however, loves tequila, and thinks that these Crystal Light Margarita Mocktails are fantastic.  She'll actually put some rum in the drinks after mixing (which is as simple as filling up a pitcher with a few quarts of water and adding the package) and turns them into a non-traditional margarita.<br /><br />Overall, these Crystal Light Mocktails are solid buy.  They're certainly cheaper than other Margarita mixes.

review/summary: Flavor stronger 2nd day, but no vitamins added
review/text: When mixed, Crystal Light Margarita is green and has a mild lime flavor with a slight dry after-taste.  The taste actually seems to improve in strength by the 2nd day, as perhaps it takes longer than expected to totally dissolve.  Its advantages are only 5 calories per serving, no gluten and low sodium, but offsetting these advantage is the lack of any vitamin inclusion, e.g., vitamin C.  It's OK, but to me seemed to light in flavor soon after mixed.

review/summary: Totally Misses the Mark
review/text: Crystal Light completely missed the mark with this one. I'll admit, I didn't expect it to replace a good margarita (Triple Sec, tequila and lime juice, straight up), but I did think that a margarita-ish flavor could be fun at events like wedding or baby showers or summer picnics. And while I still think that idea has possibilities, this isn't the product that's going to let me test it with friends.<br /><br />The Crystal Light Mocktail Margarita flavor:<br />1. Does not taste like a margarita.<br />2. Has a watered down flavor, almost like I didn't use the correct ratio of mix and water. (I did.)<br />3. Is not refreshing.<br />4. Has an unappealing and frankly, rather odd, color.<br />5. Is not a product I can recommend.

review/summary: I promise you won't get a DUI from drinking this
review/text: So this is the third "Mocktail" in the Crystal Light's line of facsimile of mixed drinks.  The flavor in question is "Margarita" and I have to say it is quite authentic (just like the Mojito and Appletini).  The flavor is very bold and has a wonderful taste that is sweet but not too sugary. The wild thing about this beverage is that you can almost taste alcohol in it.  Obviously there isn't alcohol in it, but there are hints of Tequila (or even a Corona flare).<br /><br />A serving size is only 5 calories which is pretty cool, so if someone wanted to use this as a mixer for alcohol they could.  After trying all three of these "Mocktails" I would like to see CL branch out into different flavors such as mimosa or sangria.  Overall this flavor and all the other "Mocktails" are refreshing and a wonderful spin on the orthodox drink mixes.

review/summary: It's not awful, but it's not something I'd soon get again.
review/text: I'm a fan of margaritas, so maybe my thinking is a little skewed, but this tasted nothing like a margarita. It smelled vaguely of petroleum byproduct, and had no sourness, no nothing that I'd associate with a margarita. I tried it both on its own, when I first mixed it up, then after being in the fridge overnight (so that it gets cold cold cold), and then with a bit of tequila. Nothing could improve it (although the tequila did cover the taste). If you're going to call something a margarita, at least get some of that orangey undertone, the limey top taste, and bit of sweetness that one associates with a margarita. If anyone can tell me how to make this more palatable (maybe by making it double strength, then blending it with ice?), please let me know.

review/text: As someone who tries to stay away from drinks with sugar, the flavor options for mixed powders gets pretty redundant. This is a fresh new flavor that isn't too bitter/acidic and can be consumed as a regular drink, or mixes well for low calorie adult beverages!<br /><br />The flavor could be a bit stronger, which is why I rated it a 4 star instead of 5, but that also makes it more drinkable as a regular daytime drink as well. As far as a Margarita goes, it's pretty accurate in my opinion.  I enjoy the variety and really appreciated a fresh flavor from your typical berry/lemon/ade/grape flavors that fill the shelves everywhere.

review/summary: Margarita without the buzz
review/text: Crystal Light is one my favorite brands because I'm a diabetic.  Their new line of Mocktails peaked my interest since it features three popular cocktails sans the alcohol.  The Margarita was pretty good, had a strong hint of lime and orange.  It's my favorite of the three.  In comparison to real cocktails, though, the flavor is weak.  It's not really the absence of alcohol but I suppose cocktails taste better because of the real fruit juices.  But overall, a refreshing drink that I won't say no to.  It's also very low in calories: just 5 calories for 8 fl.oz.  A 1.62 oz container will yield 40 servings. Not bad at all.

I like margaritas but I prefer a sweeter margarita. This was more a salt taste..

review/summary: Not going to fool a margarita lover!
review/text: I could almost swear that I could smell tequila when I first dumped the powder into the pitcher; I was really anticipating a true margarita taste! It had 'that smell' you get from a real margarita when first mixed.<br /><br />Sadly, this will never fool anyone into thinking it's even remotely made with sweet and sour mix and all the other good margarita ingredients! I think if you mixed TWO pouches into the pitcher, you might get a better flavor. There is also that aftertaste that Crystal Light products have....it was quickly diluted with ice in the glass so doubling the mix would make it taste better.<br />I added a little fresh lime juice, some lime slices, and a teaspoon of kosher salt and that improved the flavor somewhat! Try mixing one pouch of raspberry lemonade with one pouch of the Margarita flavor, now THAT is pretty darn tasty!<br /><br />As a margarita, it's not even close. My teen thought it tasted like 'nasty lemonade' (he wouldn't know what a margarita tastes like anyway but I wanted to see if he thought this drink mix was tasty). My husband made a face as he sipped the test batch. I could only stand to drink it after adding things to it.

review/summary: Margaritas without Guilt
review/text: You're in the mood for a delicious margarita but there's a problem. You're on a diet. You remember the Forbes article that described 9 ounce margaritas as having 740 calories. Knowing that the average person should only consume 1500 to 2000 calories a day, you crunch the stratospheric numbers and debate whether you can really afford it. "If I skip breakfast and lunch tomorrow, I can probably pull off a night of margaritas." Dread no more, Crystal Light is here! This new family of mocktails is something to text home about. While they're all well done, the most noteworthy creation is the margarita. Put simply, it tastes like a real margarita! By real, I'm referring to the margarita experience that you'd get from a bottle by Jos&eacute; Cuervo, Master of Mixes and the like. If you're a purist (tequila, Cointreau and lime juice) you won't enjoy this any better than the regular bottled stuff. As far as the bottle crowd goes, I doubt that most could differentiate between this and the regular mixes. This has the perfect balance of sweetness, lime flavor and that unique aftertaste tartness that only comes from a good margarita. It is the expected lime green color. Naturally, you don't need to add the tequila; you can simply make a pitcher and enjoy it as you would any other Crystal Light variety such as Tangerine Strawberry. Crystal Light hasn't capitalized on the hybrid potential of this as an adult beverage. Indeed, if you're lucky enough to find this in your local supermarket, it won't be in the alcohol section but the regular Crystal Light neighborhood. Kraft is wasting what could easily be the next big thing to keep Kraft Foods a family brand. If you can get past the fact that Crystal Light is an abomination of the natural world (it's an understatement to say that it's unnatural to make something so wonderful for only 5 calories a serving), margarita is proof that we can live better through chemistry. Cheers!<br /><br />The Crystal Delight Rancher Margarita<br /><br />Place the following ingredients into a large cocktail shaker, shake and pour into a glass:<br />  - 2 cups of water<br />  - 1 packet of Crystal Light Margarita Flavored Drink Mix<br />  - 2 ounces of tequila<br />  - Fill the rest of the shaker with crushed ice<br /><br />Make sure that the water is warm enough to melt the crystals. This recipe will make a margarita that is strong in flavor. It can be adjusted by using less crystals or more water. A salted rim on the glass is optional. Put in a blender, the recipe can be adapted to make a frozen margarita. The Crystal Delight Rancher Margarita has around 140 calories.

review/summary: I wanted to like it!
review/text: I am a big fan of Crystal Light beverages in general.  I like the lemonade a lot and drink it all summer long.  Because of this I was excited  to try their new margarita flavor.  The container holds 5 powder packets with each packet making 2 quarts of beverage.  When mixed thoroughly, the resulting drink is an odd murky green color (almost as if it could glow in the dark).  I got past the weird color and poured it in a glass.  Bringing it up to my mouth I thought the odor was odd.  It smelled like a type of cleaner (ammonia like).  I ignored that and tasted it.  I didn't really taste any lime at first..I did get an instant taste of the artificial sweetener (aspartame) but the thing I really noticed was the texture was very soft and it left an unpleasant coating on my tongue.  I then put the pitcher in the fridge for several hours hoping it would taste better cold but it did not.  I was really disappointed because I like Margarita cocktails and I was hoping this would make a lowcal alternative to traditional mixers.  I guess I will stick with the original Crystal Light lemonade flavor.

review/summary: Margaritas for the non-drinkers
review/text: I am not a margarita drinker; so I was surprised when I tried the Crystal Light Mocktails for Margaritas and LOVED it. I usually do not drink alcohol (to avoid the calories) but now I can "drink" cocktails. I tied the mojitos, the appletinis and the margaritas from Crystal Light and they are all VERY VERY good.<br /><br />The canister comes with 5 packets, so it is enough for a party. I tried the mocktails with my Bunco friends. The way that I prepared it was to mix the powder with water and put it in a plastic container which I froze (semi-frozen). I then scooped it into cocktail glasses and garnished them. My friends were surprised that the cocktails were alcohol free. I also had alcohol so they could mix some of it with the mocktails. The consensus was that you did not need the alcohol but it was a nice touch.<br /><br />I highly recommend all the flavors for the Crystal Light Mocktails.

review/text: So we did this with adults and kids drinking it.  As far as the adult review I was going to give it 4 stars because for someone wanting a nice sugar free margarita mix it would be a nice alternative and it has that margarita twang.  My kids all tried it and gave it 1 star saying it was the worst thing they have ever tasted so I think if you were going to give this to kids for some sort of mocktails as the title says then it might be a bust.  It really does have a very "interesting" flavor that might take some time getting used to.

review/text: I love Margaritas. YUM. Although I knew that this product would not equal the real thing, I had hoped for some semblance of flavor. The Mocktail didn't taste bad, it just didn't taste much at all. I never made another one. Plain water is better.

review/text: Just know going in, this isn't going to taste like a margarita. It's like sugar-free margarita candy, the way lemon candy has a distinct flavor but is nothing like real lemons. That's what this mix is. It's quite tasty, and a lot more fun than plain water if you want a change.<br /><br />I haven't tried it with booze yet, but I can't see how that wouldn't be great. :)

review/summary: reliable crystl light quality
review/text: We use a fair amount of Crystal Ligh in the summer months. When mixed as directed its a bit too sweet for my personal preference but adding a little extra water solves that problem and also gets you a little more drink for your money.<br /><br />The flavor is pleasant and refreshing, which is what one generally wants from a beverage such as this.

review/summary: Not  a Universally Pleasing Flavor
review/text: Some sugar-free crystal light mixes strike me as a perfect way to quench a thirst without loading up calorie-wise.  This one doesn't...exactly.  While it was OK, it wasn't a favorite.  I think the work "Mocktail" led me to believe it would be irresistably good.  The mock part was more presient than I realized though because the flavor while somewhat similar to a proper margarita was noticealbly, well mock, or artificial tasting.  Like all things related to taste, your mileage may vary.  Drinkable...yes, a standout great calorie-free beverage...not for me.  I won't be buying this one and will stick to the tried and true lemonade and orange crystal light flavors which are both calorie-free and very good.

The Margarita is execellent with Tequila or straight up! It is refreshing, not too sweet, awesome. It is a great way to stay hydrated without adding calories.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like a Margarita
review/text: To me, this "mocktail" was disappointing.  It tastes bitter and has an aftertaste.  If you enjoy margaritas, do yourself a favor and get a good bottle of Tequila (silver), some Triple Sec, Lime Juice and agave (for sweetener), and ice.  Use a blender and make a REAL margarita.  Better yet, a pitcher of margaritas.  Drinking "mocktails" is like a beer drinker drinking an O'douls and pretending he's drinking a good quality beer.  If you don't like alcohol go get yourself some Crystal Light.  Same thing.  Don't think this is gonna taste like a margarita; it doesn't.

review/summary: nice taste and very easy to make
review/text: It was a warm day here in Southern California, my wife and I were about to play a game on a table outside, and I thought to myself that I'd like something special to drink.<br /><br />Filled a pitcher with water, opened a small packet of this, mixed it in, then added some ice.  Very easy to make.<br /><br />The taste?  Well, not quite a Margarita, a bit more like an adult kool-aid with Margarita flavor, which certainly is close enough to think, "ah, Margarita."<br /><br />It has the distinctive nuance of a diet drink, but not too much so.  For the most part, it's tasty and refreshing--a great alternative if you are wanting to lose weight or just wanting to avoid alcohol.

review/summary: Crystal Light "Margarita" Mocktail
review/text: This flavor is light and refreshing; however, it doesn't hold a candle to the premixed "skinny" margarita mixers available in the grocery store (e.g., Jose Cuervo, Mix Masters, etc.). In fact, the Crystal Light margarita mix really doesn't taste like a margarita at all to me.  I was able to mix it half and half with one of the premixed mixers and the flavor was close enough, so I guess you might be able to spend a little less on your margaritas by extending your mixers with the Crystal Light, if you're on a really super tight budget.  Otherwise, I would buy it only as a refreshing alternative to the other standard Crystal Light flavors. The flavor is not tart like lemonade..just kind of smooth and refreshing. Not sure how else to describe it.

review/text: This is close approximation of a margarita, but unless you add tequila the taste is not quite right.  We used it at a BBQ as a non-alcoholic option along with the Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito and both were liked by everyone.<br /><br />The mix itself is in small packets, each packet makes 2 quarts.  Not them most eco-friendly way to package a product but it is easier than measuring out scoops.

review/text: When I see the word margarita on a drink, it just makes me smile.  This Crystal Light version is tasty enough, but you won't ever mistake it for a real margarita, but that is fine too.  It does make a big pitcher, 2 qts/8 cups, which is a good option and something different that the whole family can drink.  My one downfall is that the nasty aspartame is in it, as well as artificial colors.  I am by no means a food purist, but I try to avoid foods/drinks that have chemicals in them that aren't necessary.  Still, as a treat now and then, it is worthy.  And yes, I even added some tequila to mine.  Makes a good drink even better.

review/text: The Crystal Light Mocktails Margaritais a somewhat pleasant drink for non-drinkers. Nothing is going to taste like a Margarita without the Tequila, however this might be as close as you get without the Tequila. I am not much of a drinker, but I do enjoy a good Margarita from time to time. The Crystal Light Mocktails lets you enjoy the drink without all the calories. These however do have a slight after taste. It is not that bad, but it is still there.

review/summary: Didn't like this at all
review/text: I really love margaritas, so I was thrilled when there was a nearly-zero calorie version of the flavor. Except, at least to me, it tasted really artificial. It smelled artificial. It even looked artificial. Almost neon green. I was hoping I didn't turn into the hulk or a mutant ninja turtle. Now, I like crystal light (pink Lemonade is my favorite), and drink "diet" sodas, teas, etc. so I don't mean to trash all low-calorie drinks. This was just odd. My daughter (who is 12) also like margarita MIX, she always orders a virgin one when we go to Mexican restaurants. And she wouldn't drink the container of this either. We both agreed that it wasn't terrible or anything, just not good.

review/summary: Delicious, Refreshing, No Calories!
review/text: I've never been a fan of powdered drink mixes particularly, but a medical diagnosis ten years ago prohibits me from drinking alcohol.  One drink I really miss is a good ol' lip-smacking sour Margarita.  And now, thanks to Crystal Light, I can have the next best thing.  Those who complain about "after-taste," just aren't used to sugar-free drinks.  I've been a Diet Coke drinker since way back, so that aspect doesn't bother me a bit.<br /><br />I made mine a little stronger than recommended so I could add lots of ice.  It's wonderful; very tart, very true to the Margarita flavor - heck, it's even a little salty.  My husband likes it, and he hates sugar-free drinks.<br /><br />Those of you who try and don't like...let me know and I'll be happy to take the extras off your hands.  :)

review/summary: An excellent low carb alternative!
review/text: My husband and I are watching our carbohydrate intake but do enjoy our cocktails. We found the Crystal Light Mocktails and decided to give them a try. While they cannot compete with a "real" cocktail made with fresh ingredients or good mixers, if you are diabetic or watching carbs/calories for dietary reasons, these are an excellent alternative. We found that we prefer them to be mixed a little stronger than the recipe on the packets advise so we just use a smaller combination of water/alcohol to achieve the taste we prefer. One thing we found with the margarita mix is that it is greatly improved simply by adding some freshly squeezed lime juice, which is pretty low in carbs & calories. Also, if you want a tangy boost, you can use triple sec but it will add carbs/calories so instead use a small amount of orange extract (like 1/4 teaspoon for starters). Another favorite of ours has been the Crystal Light Cranberry mixed with water and vodka. I love real cranberry juice but it has so many carbs/calories, so this is an excellent alternative. Of course, it isn't going to provide the healthy benefits of drinking real cranberry juice, but we are talking about cocktails here.

review/text: This tastes OK - like a non-specific flavor of tropical fruit drink. However, it is not a substitute for actual Margarita mix.  If you want the Margarita taste without the alcohol, I recommend adding some ginger ale or similar drink to regular Margarita mix.  The point of this Crystal Light mix is to have the taste without the alcohol OR calories, but it does not quite hit the mark.

review/summary: Flavor nothing special, nothing like a Margarita; but plastic container nice for reuse
review/text: Wow.  I'm not sure what I am supposed to think about this.  The taste is slightly lime-like, but definitely not tequila-like and not at all like a Margarita.  Sort of seems like a weak faux-lime candy flavor.  It is not bad, but not great either.  It looks like some sort of radioactive green in the pitcher in my refrig (I measured the exact amount of water specified in the instructions).<br /><br />If you like using Crystal Light kinds of drinks, this is probably yet another reasonable choice. But it is nothing special.  Sort of like Kool-Aid but slightly more subtle.<br /><br />The plastic container is really nice and will be handy to reuse.<br /><br />I'm not sure why they mention this as marketed to "women".  Though it is not awful (hence 3 stars), I can't imagine anyone going out of the way to get this.

review/summary: Very Good Product for the Price
review/text: The good side of this product is actually two sided; it tastes relatively good and it doesn't have any calories to speak of.  The downside is the artificial sweetner may not necessarily be very good for you, especially if you consume this beverage a lot.  The problem is you can't really make a small quantity; you (if you follow the directions) must put a packet with two quarts of water and mix.  So you have got to drink two quarts in a relatively short period (I don't think it holds up that well after a week at most).  As an occasional drink (but not all the time), I think it is all right, but I personally would not drink it every day, summer or not.  Tea (green or white) is my preference, and I think it is much better for you, especially if you use lemon only or just a pinch of sugar or some sweetener of the same line.

review/summary: Hint 'O Margarita
review/text: The title is the review best describes my impression of this drink.<br /><br />This version of Crystal Light is sweet, maybe a tad too sweet, and tastes vaguely like a margarita but then only vaguely.  At first, I thought I had added too much water, but I double checked the directions and I hadn't.  The proof was that it was sweet as it probably should (if that is too sweet, that is personal preference.)<br /><br />So, this drink is sweet, mildly limey with a hint of margarita flavor but not enough IMHO.  Margarita's just aren't this subtle.  The strong sweetener aftertaste is to be expected of a diet drink so I can't really complain about that.<br /><br />In summary, a sugar free Marg is a great idea but I personally would expect a stronger lime/margarita flavor.  If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, a subtlely-limey sugar-free non-alcoholic margarita, you're in luck.  If this isn't you, then I recommend looking elsewhere.

This is NOT the product for that.<br /><br />If you've had other Crystal Light fruity flavor drinks, this is really just like a limeaid flavor of them.  To call it "Mocktails Margarita" is pure sophistry.<br /><br />In any case, the product itself is fine - it just isn't so much what they are trying to say it is.  Calling it "Mocktails Margarita" sets up a different expectation from what it really is.  If you like the other Crystal Light fruity flavors, and you like a limeaid flavor, you'll probably like this.  If you're really looking for a Margarita flavor, or for a mixer, you'll probably be disappointed.

review/summary: Better than water
review/text: My wife hates to drink plain water. She's a freak. So she uses Crystal Light all the time to flavor her water. She loved this stuff and it was gone almost overnight. She went and got more and replaced her old standby flavors. She gives it 5 stars. I'll stick to water.

review/summary: Awful
review/text: I love a good margarita, unfortunately this isn't even in the ballpark.  The taste was awful; metallic aftertaste, kind of watered down, left me thirsty for anything else but this.  Even the best tequila couldn't help revive this product, and it would be a crime to waste any amount of tequila by attempting it.  It's unfortunate 0 stars isn't an option.

review/summary: Not as good as Mojito, but still refreshing
review/text: This flavor of Crystal Light is like their Mojito minus the mint.  It's a faintly-lime flavor, reminiscent of old-time green Gatorade.  It may be too much of a chemical taste for some, but it is refreshing after a workout.

review/summary: We love these!!
review/text: We've now tried not only this item, but also the "mojito" and "appletini" flavors, and they're all hits in our household! In fact, these are the first drinks I've found that get my partner to cut back on the caffeine and sugar and reach for this instead. I personally like the margarita flavor the best of the three, but I also like the real margaritas better than the other two mixed drinks; your opinion may vary. These have now become a staple purchase for our family.

review/summary: It's pretty good...
review/text: I got this and the mojito flavor.  I would have to say that this flavor is fine, but doesn't really stand apart that much from a limeade flavor.  If you want a refreshing, lime-flavored water add-in, I would go with their mojito flavor, instead.  But it you just want a simple, yummy, lime-flavored drink that you can easily make by the pitcher, this one is good.

review/summary: Tolerable
review/text: If you like diet soda, artificial sweeters, you may like this.  I can't get past the artifical sweeter flavors.  I like the concept of less sweet than lemonade, but I want the sweet to be real.  In margarita I expect some orange and lime flavor -- this taste like lemonade.  If I had to drink it I could, but I ended up pouring out the rest of it and am throwing the packets away.  No point.

review/summary: Other Mocktail flavors that are better, but good low cal margarita
review/text: I have tried all of the Crystal Light Mocktails flavors with this being my least favorite.  I am not a fan of Margaritas anyway so that may play a part in my opinion.  As just a drink flavor, and not comparing it to the taste of a Margartia, I would say it is just ok.  I liked the Appletini and Mojito Mocktails much much better.  If you are a lover of Margaritas but don't want the calories this may be a good option for you.

review/summary: Great little mixer
review/text: I also reviewed the mojito, so my reaction is much the same. This is a good little mixer, and is a nice way to get the margarita flavor when you can't have or don't want to have the actual margarita (I'm pregnant, so no margaritas for me!). Tastes good enough alone, but would be even better with a little alcohol added in (or, for fun, add a splash of something carbonated if you're not having the alc version). I do wish they came in individual serving packets instead of "pitcher-size" packets, since I'm generally making a glass at a time and not a whole pitcher. These are good, though, and I'd guy these again if looking for a mixer, rather than one of those giant mixer things (which would take us forever to use up).

review/summary: like the real thing
review/text: As soon as I opened a packet, I was impressed; it actually smelled like a real margarita.  The taste is great too.  I typically favor the lemonade varieties as they aren't too sweet and this one fits right in.  I like limes, so this is perfect.  The margarita flavor is nicely refreshing.

review/text: This company's customer service is fantastic!  I accidentally got the wrong product, I contacted the company and within hours that SAME day, they contacted me and corrected the problem.  I would hands down buy from them again, as I am very impressed with their service, as well as, their products. Definitely a five star rating for sure.

review/summary: Yummy, and No Hangover!
review/text: I really like the flavor of this drink mix. It's very similar to the flavor of a rocks margarita, and a good one, too - it's not like taking a sip of margarita mix, which is way too sweet. It'll remind you of pitchers of margaritas you've shared with your friends, without any of the unwanted side effects. It's a great drink choice: low in calories, no alcohol, no hangovers, no brain freeze.

review/summary: What A Terrible Idea
review/text: Whoever it was over at Crystal Light thought this was a good idea should be fired.We drink alot of Crystal Light around our house, mostly the lemonade.  I picked this Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita up as a change of pace.  What a horrible mistake.<br /><br />This tastes just awful.  It tastes vaguely like a margarita but the overwhelming flavor is salt.  Drinking this flavor just makes you thirstier.  And with each passing sip, this stuff begins to taste worse and worse.  It is terrible.<br /><br />Maybe if you used this thing as a mixer and added some tequila or vodka to it, maybe it wouldn't taste so god awful.  But I'm not gonna try.  This stuff is terrible.  DO NOT BUY.  Ugh.

review/summary: Doesn't pass as a margarita
review/text: Ugh! Ick! What IS that flavor? I think they tried to add some sort of flavor they thought was alcohol-y to the lime. It's undrinkable.<br /><br />Before pouring it down the drain, though, I mixed it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024NXUZI">Diet Pepsi</a> and it wasn't too bad. I tried it with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007F1KYVC">V8 Splash Diet Tropical Blend</a>, too, and that wasn't bad either. At least it's a way to use up the packs.

review/summary: Change of pace
review/text: I did not care for this mix with the first batch I made. I did not know what it tasted like, but it didn't taste like a margarita to me. Maybe if I added a shot of tequila? Then some lemon or lime juice? A splash of an orange liqueur? Wait! If I had those ingredients, I could just, you know, make a margarita. Crystal Light Mocktails Margarita just does not have the sour bite or tang you get with real lemon or lime juice.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks, I decided to mix up another batch before reviewing it. About half way through the second batch, I decided that, even if it does not taste like a margarita to me, it's not bad in and of itself and makes for a good change of pace from the Crystal Light Natural Lemonade and Sunrise Classic Orange flavors I most often use. Mixing up two quarts at a time is, however, too much for me. If was sold in single serve  On-the-Go packets, I'd definitely buy it.

review/summary: ugh it doesn't taste good
review/text: I tried the Crystal Light Mocktails Mojito flavor and LOVED IT. So I decided to try this Margarita flavor too. It's SO BAD TASTING. Everyone in my house who has tried it has made a face upon tasting it, myself included. It doesn't taste like margarita, and it doesn't even taste good. I dumped out the pitcher I made.

review/summary: Great Idea...Great Taste!
review/text: I couldn't believe how much this Crystal Light Mocktail tasted like the real deal.  My wife and I are BIG fans of Margaritas, Mojitos, and the like, but are not always fans of the calories that come with them.  Along comes Crystal Light to the rescue with their Mocktails - yes, calorie-free imitation cocktails that even the kids could drink.  They truly do taste good...though no not quite an exact replica of the real drink.  For the purpose it's designed to do...these drinks serve the task well.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Just Okay
review/text: I tried both the Margarita and Appletini flavors.  Neither of them was particularly strong-flavored.<br /><br />The Margarita, for me, had an odd coconut aftertaste at first.  Not unpleasant, just strange.  The more I drank, the less I noticed it, and my husband said he did not notice it at all.  When I set the glass down and didn't drink for a while, there it was again.<br /><br />The Appletini tasted like apples.  No surprise there.  My first impression was that the flavor was weak, but the more I drank, the more I tasted the, somewhat artificial, apple flavor.  Not bad, but not memorable either.<br /><br />Will I buy these again?  I would say no, although my husband said he'd possibly give the Margarita one a try again in the summertime.  For me, I'll stick with the standard lemonade flavor Crystal Light.  It's more intense than either of these.

review/summary: Flavorful, but not the real thing
review/text: First impression is to wonder just what the point is for the Moctail line of flavors, are we supposed to use them as drink mix and add alcohol or are they meant as yet another flavor. Either way you save some calories with these zero calorie drink mixes.<br /><br />My first pass I discovered that adding enough water is pretty important as the flavor can be pretty intense if under diluted. Subsequent trials have yielded better results, and I find them to be pretty refreshing, but nothing like the actual drinks that they are named after as far as taste. I have tasted the Mojito and Margarita flavors and favor the Mojito one for taste, though both are drinkable.<br /><br />Overall, diversity is a good thing and the Moctail line offers that to the diet drinking public, just don't try to compare them to real cocktails.

review/text: I have to say that this does taste like a margarita.  However, it has a bit of an artificial taste to it that I found a little distracting.  I dont think I could drink a lot of it without getting a bit tired of it.  But that is probably just a personal preference.  My teenage daughter absolutely loved it and is drinking all of it.
