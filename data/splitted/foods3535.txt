review/summary: What I imagine dishwater tastes like...
review/text: I love tea.  I was so excited to try this, because of health benefits, as well as the supposedly delicious taste.  I bought the whole case with the intention of enjoying some myself and giving some as presents.  The reviews were so positive, and I thought the vanilla would have to make it wonderful no matter what.  But, I was wrong.  To my taste, this tea is awful.  It's nearly tasteless (which I do not consider a benefit in tea), but what I did taste wasn't very nice.  After one cup, I threw away the box I'd opened and put the unopened boxes where people could take them if they wanted.  I wouldn't have given it to anyone as a gift.

review/summary: LOOKS STRONG TASTE LIKE VANILLA WATER
review/text: I TRIED THE RED BUSH POMENGRANITE AND IT WAS QUITE AWESOME. FULL OF FLAVOR BUT NOT THIS TEA I HAVE PUT TWO BAGS AND LET IT SIT FOR 20 MINUTES AND IT STILL LACKS TASTE ON THE FRONT END. YOU CATCH THE VANILLA ON THE BACK AND IT IS VERY SUBTLE TO THE POINT OF WHERE IS THE TASTE? I AM DRINKING IT AS I WRITE THIS AND STILL FIND THAT RED BUSH TEA HAS VERY LITTLE REAL FLAVOR. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USED TO BLACK TEA OR EXPRESSO IT WOULD BE A JOKE. I ONLY DRINK HERBAL TEAS BUT I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TRY ANY OTHER FLAVOR. THE BENGAL SPICE AND POMEGRANITE ARE EXCELLENT. I HAVE TO DESCRIBE THE TASTE IS SORT OF A LIGHT TOBACCO TASTE(NOT A SMOKER)WITH VERY MILD VANILLA AND LACKLUSTER FLAT TASTE(PLAIN OR WATER DOWNED) BASE EVEN THOUGH THE COLOR IS DEEP RICH AND RED. I LIKE THE HEALTH BENEFITS AND WILL KEEP BUYING RED BUSH BUT NOT THIS FLAVOR.

review/text: We have had such an issue with trying to find the right food for our daughter Adrianne, I made all the food for our son but having a second baby with special needs has made things a bit complicated with very little time to make the type of food I would for A. We stumbled on this brand in an email from amazon and decided to give it a try...I have never been this impressed, OMG, for the first time my baby eat an entire cup of peas and she was very happy, this is her first vegetable in 3 months of solid food without her crying.. I am so grateful to this company, the food looks, smells and taste like the real food.. I wonder why all brands don't follow the same steps...We also got apples, squash, sweet potato and every meal is a hit..

review/text: The Salami is excellent, but unfortunatly It come in a very poor packaging, the merchandise was warm and sueting and not comestible in that condition. The Cie should think about putting the salami with Ice Packs and silver bubles bag like it come in, but also  It should be protected with a hard foam box too, so, the heat will not affected the product.<br /><br />I get some perishable food from "Le Village" very well pack in a hard foam box isolated the items pack inside the box in silver bag with a lot of ice boxes.<br /><br />Anyway It is too bad because I love that salami but I guess I will have to wait January when It is cold here to out an order again.<br /><br />Sincerely<br /><br />Christine James

review/text: This sauce tastes good but I can't call it an original Korean hot pepper paste or Gochujang. Rather, this one is more like Gochujang-based light sauce for raw fish, made with Gochujang,sugar and vinegar. If you want to try authentic thick Gochujang, Haechandle's or Sunchang's Gochujang is the best.

review/text: I am a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, and this sauce needs to be diluted with other less spicy sauces for me to be able to use it. My husband likes it quite a bit. He says it is a sweet and slightly less spicy version of Sriracha sauce for those of you familiar with it and wondering about this sauce. It has a very nice flavor and we use it in stir fry, noodle dishes and tonight, my husband used it in lieu of barbeque sauce on grilled chicken. We recommend this sauce.

review/text: I won't quibble with folks that question the authenticity, but this product nailed my quest for a certain Korean sweet-n-spicy mix.  I spent a few years in Korean and developed a craving for this condiment that I would get at the cheap chicken take-out joints or even the massive company cafeteria where we worked.  I suppose I love this stuff because it triggers memories of those wonderful times, even though the higher-end restaurants probably had "better" formulations.  I will be keeping a supply of this on my shelf as a basic necessity.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty!
review/text: I picked up a can of this product at an Italian imports store mostly because it seemed unlike any other food I'd ever eaten. I'll admit the can sat ignored in my kitchen cabinet for several months because, well, I had my doubts about how "sardine seasoning for macaroni" could possibly taste good. Tonight I wanted to have something quick and easy at home instead of venturing out in the rain, so I braced myself, heated the sauce and ate half of it over some spaghetti without doctoring it up in any way. It was delicious! The fennel, currants, onions and salt balance out the sardines perfectly and the sauce doesn't taste at all fishy. I'll be getting some more of it soon. It's probably not for everyone, but if you're at all adventurous when it comes to food I strongly recommend that you give it a try.

review/text: My husband's family is from Sicily and Pasta Con Sarde is a tradition.  I researched various recipies, but frankly, this premade product does the trick. I "doctor" it up with fresh fennel, add pinenuts and currants, and use a good fresh marina as a base.  Nothing else is needed and the prep time is cut by 90% - a huge time savings when trying to prepare "7 Fishes" for Christmas Eve dinner.  (Frankly, I could loose the 7 fishes and would be happy with just the sauce.)

review/text: When I moved to the U.K. about fifteen years ago I came across Yorkshire Tea. There are lots of tea brands available in British supermarkets (far more than you'll find in the U.S.)and I tried several of them. However, I found Yorkshire Tea to be the best. It makes a good strong cup of tea with with a fine aroma. It's also economical-4 level teaspoons make 6 cups of great tea. But, please, brew it the right way. Use fresh cold water and bring it to the boil-not 200 degrees or 205 degrees but boiling at 212. Let it steep for 5 minutes, give it a good stir and pour it into the cup. I drink it with milk-no sugar. Try it your way. You won't be disappointed.

review/text: Well, I never thought I would say THAT !<br />I've tried multiple brewing methods and so far (about half the bag already)I haven't really enjoyed this product. It is sold as "loose tea"  but, it looks like and behaves like freeze-dried crumblies. It makes dark, brown tea in about 1 1/2 minutes. It's strong, but not flavorful. It has none of the delicacy I drink teas for, in the first place. This is the coffee of teas. Yes, it is better with milk and sugar in it, but it shouldn't have to be added to. No bouquet. Today, I used loose-leaf Lipton (very cheap at the W store). It is absolutely delicious and not flat like the Yorkshire. Reviews are subjective, of course. I must say that Taylor's makes very good teas, especially high-end tea bags (if you must).

review/summary: Amazing peanut butter
review/text: Peanut Butter & Co's Mighty Maple Peanut Butter is delicious!!  It makes an amazing healthy snack with sliced apples and a spoonful gets me through my sweets cravings.  The tiny little crunch in the texture is what makes this flavor so addictive for me.  I LOVE that little crunch along with the creaminess.  (Another reviewer called it "grit".) If you want it without the tiny bit of crunch, get the honey flavor - it is yummy too, and smooth and creamy.  GREAT STUFF!!  I'm glad Amazon has this brand for a good deal.

review/summary: great taste, but gritty texture :(
review/text: I had heard such great things about this brand and was thrilled to find it on amazon for sooooo much cheaper than the company website.  I ordered the Maple flavor and eagery awaited its arrival.  It smelled like heaven when I opened the jar, but when I tasted it, it was gritty.  No, seriously, like someone had mixed a few tablespoons of sand in my peanut butter jar.  I immediately checked the expiration date thinking something had gone terribly wrong here.  The peanut butter was not due to expire for over a year, so age was not the culprit. I went online and googled the item, hoping to find some other reviews mentioning the gritty texture.  Sure enough, others had experienced the same thing, and apparently, according to an employee of the company, the maple flavor is SUPPOSED to be like that due to the cane sugar crystals.  In fact, he even states, that is his favorite feature of that flavor! WHAT?! Has the world gone crazy?! I couldn't even eat it...it was the culinary equivalent of running your fingernails down a chalkboard.  I have read that if you bake with it or mix it in something hot, like oatmeal, that the sugar crystals will dissolve, and you can actually enjoy the wonderful flavor, but I would not recommend using it at room temp or colder.  Other amazon reviews don't mention anything about the grit factor, so I guess it didn't bother them.  I can't conceive of that, but hey, more power to them.  I read that the cinnamon raisin swirl flavor has the same gritty texture, so keep that in mind if you are considering that one as well.  Good luck!<br /><br />BTW, Amazon was very cool and immediately refunded my money.

review/summary: Ordering 6 at a time - hard to pace myself
review/text: I saw that the Amazon price ordering 6 at a time was much cheaper, so I tried it. (Too bad you can't mix flavors.)<br />As I suspected, the product is eaten that much faster when there is more of it in the house.<br />My biggest fear in ordering was expiration dates. No fear here: my jars ordered 03/2011 are best eaten by 11/2012.<br /><br />I do not have a problem w/the crunchy crystals - it makes me think of the sparkly maple sugar candy in the shape of maple leaves. This morning I added some to my bowl of Grapenuts & Vanilla Almond Breeze.<br />I also eat product right out of the jar. Peanut Butter & Co's products like other peanut butters use to have oil at the top & had to be stirred. I liked it better then, although the initial stir was tough, when you put the jar in the fridge the product turned into yummy fudge - so much better for eating out of the jar!<br /><br />Since the product now lacks a fudge form, for variety I like subjecting a serving to the toaster oven.

review/text: I love this brand. I have tried both this flavor and the Chocolate Dream and both are wonderful. What is even better is the ingredients - everything natural with no fillers or unhealthy sugars. I feel good about eating it and giving it to my kids. The price is reasonable for the quality. This flavor taste like a more yummy version of your store brand peanut butter. Excellent for a hearty peanut butter sandwich. I am going to try peanut butter cookies with this as well! It also has a very good shelf life - I think about 12 months which is perfect when buying a multi-pack.

review/summary: Texture needs a re-think
review/text: I've had a couple of other PB&Co peanut butters and was pretty happy with them so I wanted to try the maple. But I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentions the gritty texture. I'm guessing that the maple syrup added to the mix has, at some point crystallized. I'm not enamored of the micro-crunch but the flavor really is great. Despite my only giving 2 stars, I'm not going to return any of this. And I am going to try toasting a PB sammich with this PB because I think with heat, it might melt into smoothness.<br /><br />I'd really like PB&Co. to do some testing to ensure that they kill the grit. Then this would be an absolute 5 star product for sure. Also, the other highly positive reviewers don't seem to be bothered by this so perhaps it's an intermittent problem. Bottom line: flavor worth it but be ready for the possibility of a very fine grittiness.

review/text: PB & Co makes some of the best peanut butters.  All have their place.  The maple peanut butter is alright on a spoon but it is most amazing when put on a slice of a cool crisp apple.  That is where it shines. As to some of the others: the chocolate is best on a spoon or with a banana and the white chocolate is a bit sweet but is good on a spoon or on a sandwich with a not so sweet jelly.  There is a little more sugar in this peanut butter, but there is also a lot of nutrition in the peanuts and there is no corn syrup.

review/summary: Bought for my hubby -- I'm the best wife in his eyes now!
review/text: When our local Kroger stopped selling their brand of maple flavored peanut butter, and after hearing my husband whine about not having anymore maple flavored peanut butter, I had to get to searching for something to replace what he'd had before and just hope it was as good.  So after reading the reviews, and knowing how many I had to purchase (6 in the pkg), I went ahead and bit the bullet.  Told him he had a surprise coming in the mail in a few days that he would be thrilled about.  When it arrived, he was quite pleased.  Then he tried it, and was even more happy :)  He said the grittiness that you feel is just perfect, that's what he loves about good peanut butter.  He loves this stuff and I'll definitely be buying it again just as soon as he uses up that last jar!  And of course, now I see that our Kroger carries this brand, but still not in maple flavor :(  Awesome product, I must say, and worth ordering 6 of to get that joy from my husband :)

I actually wouldn't mind a bit more maple but I am not disappointed in the flavor.  I love the crystals in the texture- like little flavor explosions in your mouth.  I was hesitant to buy a 6 pack, thinking we would never use them all but the first jar is half empty after just a few days.  We have used it in sandwiches and on cinnamon crackers.  Tomorrow we are going to use it on waffles!

review/summary: Maple is a delicious complement to peanut butter
review/text: I first tried maple flavored peanut butter when I found Kroger's Private Selection brand.  Just as I fell in love with the flavor, for some reason Kroger stopped stocking it.  Naturally I checked Amazon to see what they had in the way of maple flavored peanut butter and discovered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GQ3E5A">Peanut Butter & Co. Peanut Butter, Mighty Maple, 16-Ounce Jars (Pack of 6)</a> .<br /><br />There are 180 calories in a 2 tbsp. serving which provides 6 grams of protein.  I've posted a picture of the back label showing the nutrition facts.  I was hoping that the Peanut Butter & Co. product would be as good as the Kroger one and I was so happy to find out that it was much much better.  Not only does it not have as many additives but I find both the taste and the texture to be superior.  I love the crunchy sugar grains and thanks to other reviewers, I was not surprised by them.  It does melt very well as I have found by adding it to a bowl of hot oatmeal and spreading it on a warm bagel.<br /><br />I'm so glad that this is on subscribe and save since I do believe I will be eating a lot of it :)

Read other reviews that faulted the graininess of the maple crystals in the peanut butter but, as former New Englanders, born and bred, we're used to getting quality maple products in all its' forms (crystalized maple candies being one of my personal favorites).  Anyway, all that to say, it's like maple candies mixed with peanut butter - ok by me.

review/text: my whole household loves this peanut butter- grit and all! it's got an amazing flavor; as a life-long new englander i'm always skeptical of "maple flavored" products but this is perfect. It's got a real maple taste to it, and it doesn't overwhelm. I am not a fan of chunky peanut butter but smooth can be boring..I think the sugar crystals are the best part! It's like candy peanut butter ^_^. It is delicious when it gets melty on toast and it's my top choice for making peanut butter cookies. Sorry grit naysayers, I hope they never change it! You have plenty of others to pick from.

review/summary: Great Sweetener but learn about the product
review/text: I wanted to share that my own experience with finding xylitol was nothing short of a miracle.  I can enjoy food in moderation that I was denying myself.  I say moderation, because xylitol can cause soft or even liquid stool if you overdo it.  It's not safe for pets because they get severe hypoglycemia quickly which can kill them, especially puppies and kittens.  What I do is mix this with stevia drops and I can then use that concentration for coffee and tea all day without ill effects.  I feel I need to address some reviews that people have on xylitol, not necessarily from Now foods specifically.  I am concerned about people buying a new product without checking what it is and then giving it bad reviews for effects written clearly on the bag.  It would be different if the manufacturer was being deceptive but honestly, don't feed your kids something if you don't know what it is and then want it taken off the market.  For some people this is a miracle food.  Research any food you are going to put into your body or even bring into your home.  It is not a manufacturers job or governments job to tell you what to eat.  I'm not saying this to be mean, it's just that we've become way too passive about our own responsibility.

review/summary: This is a great product - (Dog owners be careful)
review/text: Great product, great company.  High quality xylitol made from corn, not birch.<br /><br />However, this stuff is very toxic to dogs.  Don't let them have any of it, not even small quantities.  If you want a sweetener like this but without such toxicity to dogs, get Erythritol.  Same sort of thing -- a sugar alcohol, but not dangerous for animals.  Also, it does not have the same digestive effects (gas, bloating, diarrhea) that Xylitol does.  It is maybe a little less sweet than Xylitol, however.<br />This does not mean it is bad for people - for example, chocolate is fine for people but also toxic to dogs.<br /><br />Note:  When I do buy it, I use this company.  I've ordered Xylitol and Erythritol from them and they were VERY high quality.  When I tried it from EmeraldForest, I found some products had a horrible, strange smell and faint aftertaste.  I called to return the items and was treated very badly by their customer service.  EmeraldForest is getting some of their products made in China (not all - their xylitol apparently not), and I wondered why it has that horrible odor.  Kinda scary.  Also, their customer service is very bad.  If you check their terms and conditions, you will see something sort of unusual for an online merchant:  "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone...".  When I tried to return the odd smelling product to them citing their money back guarantee, they went around about it and then finally agreed, but said then they would never sell anything to me ever again (!).  Wow.<br /><br />I'm sticking with NOW Foods at this point.

review/summary: Can't live without it
review/text: Having suffered from Chronic Candida Albicans for over 10 years, I finally came to terms with the idea that I CANNOT have any type of sugars or sweeteners, not even natural sugars from fruits. Being a fruit lover who used to eat lots of fruits on a daily basis, I started looking for a safe way to have sweet stuff without feeding the microorganisms that have been for so long attacking my system. After a lengthy research of more than a year, I found out that though most sweeterners FEED bacteria and Candida Albicans, Xylitol DOES NOT. I started using Xylitol regularly and found out, to my surprise, that my worst Candida symptoms were GONE. The symptoms would recur every time I had fruits (darn!)or something made with refined sugar or other sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia, or even the Aspartame that is used on Diet Drinks. Whether I liked it or not, it became clear to me that I could not eat or drink anything sweet, that I could neither have any fruits and that I could not drink any diet sodas. I have intensely and extensively "tested" Xylitol for over a year and I can AFFIRM without a doubt that it is the ONLY sweetener I can use without getting my symptoms back.<br />I buy chocolates made with Xylitol on a regular basis and I use this brand of Xylitol to make chocolate bread and all kinds of cookies. I also make healthy chocolate ice cream with Xylitol, unsweetened cocoa powder and soy milk. If it were not for Xylitol, I would not be able to put anything sweet in my mouth. One of the most recognizable and annoying Candida Albicans symptoms was that I had to get up every one or two hours every night  to urinate (!!). It was a nightmare, but it helped immensely when it came to "testing" what was good or bad for me. Conclusion: If I stay away from all types of sugars, natural fruits, fruit juices and sweeteners, and only use Xylitol-sweetened stuff, I feel much better in every respect and, very importantly, I can sleep 6 or more hours in a row without waking up to go to the bathroom.

All you have to do is proof the yeast in the beginning with a teaspoon of real sugar to make it foam and then you can use xylitol as the sweetener in the recipe. This will add about 4 grams of total sugar to the recipe.

review/text: I can taste artificial sweeteners from across the street.  Hate the stuff.  In a restaurant I sent a Coke back three times because they kept bringing me Diet, assuring me it was the real thing.  After the third time I suggested they check their hoses.  Sure enough, they were switched.  Hate the stuff. One sip and my mouth says, "Yuk!" for hours.  This doesn't even get into the fact that aspertame isn't fit for human consumption.<br /><br />Enter Xylitol.  I bought a box of packets to use at the office where I drink coffee.  I find I need two Xylitol packs to replace one sugar.  No matter.  It tastes fine.  I detect no aftertaste.  And it's actually good for my teeth and blood sugar level.  This is something I can like!<br /><br />My only complaint was the shipping packaging.  The box of packets was stuffed into an envelope which, of course, arrived flattened.  Packets were all over the inside.  I reformed the box and reloaded it. No biggie, but putting a rectangular cardboard box in an envelope isn't the best idea.

review/summary: Natural Sweetener
review/text: Since I'm always looking for natural alternatives to regular processed sugar, this item caught my attention when I read it was an ingredient in "Xylichew" chewing gums.<br /><br />Not only does Xylitol not promote tooth decay, it has natural ingredients to decrease plaque formation and adhesion. Xylitol is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar alcohol found in many fruits including plums, strawberries and raspberries. Our bodies actual produce about 11g of Xylitol a day.<br /><br />It is commercially manufactured from "xylan hemicellulose" sources such as Birch trees in Finland. This "NOW" Xylitol is actually made from a corn source.<br /><br />Xylitol actually has been proven to:<br />Reduce Tooth Decay<br />Prevent Cavities by inhibiting the growth of bacteria<br />Inhibits the growth of a related species, Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a cause of ear infections<br />Reduce the secretion of Plaque Acids<br />Facilitate the Remineralization of Tooth Enamel<br /><br />Xylitol is believed to be safe, but doses higher than 30 g per day can cause stomach discomfort. To sweeten one cup of tea, you may need as much as 3 teaspoons which is 12 grams. This would equal 30 calories and 12 grams of Carbohydrates.<br /><br />Each teaspoon contains:<br /><br />Total Fat 0g<br />Sugars 0g<br />Sugar Alcohol 4g<br />Sodium 0mg<br />Protein 0g<br /><br />"Now" Xylitol is 100% Pure Xylitol Powder. This product resembles sugar and has a third fewer calories than table sugar. It is a good alternative for diabetics and can be used as a sugar substitute in recipes. Calculate how much each serving will contain to make sure you can use this ingredient in your recipes.<br /><br />When compared to the SoooLite! NoCarbs Blend, this product does have Carbohydrates and more Calories. If you are looking for a No Carbs blend sweetner, NuNaturals SoooLite! Is perfect for tea. It only seems to contain .45 grams of Sugar Alcohol per packet. Both are great sweet alternatives to sugar.<br /><br />If you are tired of the aftertaste of other artificial sweeteners, give these products a try.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: So this stuff taste great. It feels a lot better mentally knowing that it's a natural product and has roughly the same consistency/viscosity as real sugar/sugar crystals. There is one caveat with this product, you will likely have diarrhea until you get used to it. If you use this for coffee like myself and you like to have that coffee before work or something, i would advise you to use it when you won't have issues with that. Supposedly this will stop once you develop some kind of tolerance, but i can't vouch for that since i've used it for the last few days. Other than that i think this is a great alternative to real sugar and the chemicals in other artificial sweeteners.

It looks like sugar, taste like sugar and sweetens like sugar, This xylitol does not leave a funny after taste like most sugar substitutes and the granules are fine like regular sugar. I find that they dissolve fast especially in hot liquids. It comes in a zip lock type bag which is great. If you have never used xylitol before you may experience bloating/gas till your body gets used to it.<br /><br />There are many health benefits to Xylitol here are a few ,"natural insulin stabilizer, therefore it doesn't cause a spike in blood sugar and actually helps reduce sugar and carbohydrate cravings,counteracts harmful intestine bacteria, such as Helicobacter pylori, aids in better dental health,lower calories and it has no known toxic levels to humans but it will harm dogs.<br /><br />Serving Size: 1 Teaspoon (4 g)<br />Servings Per Container: 283<br /><br />Calories  10<br />Calories from Fat  0<br />Total Fat  0 g<br />Total Carbohydrate 4 g<br />Sugars  0 g<br />Xylitol  4 g<br />Sodium  0 mg<br />Protein  0 g<br /><br />Glycemic Index:<br />* Xylitol 7<br />* Agave Nectar 15<br />* Barley Malt Syrup 42<br />* Maple Syrup 54<br />* Backstrap Molasses 55<br />* Honey 62<br />* White Sugar 68<br />* High Fructose Corn Syrup 100<br />* Glucose 100

review/summary: Who needs cane sugar?
review/text: I have been using xylitol (natural sugar from birch trees) for about a year.  Other brands were about 75% as sweet as cane sugar, but this brand is perfectly matched, teaspoon for teaspoon.  Without the blood sugar spikes as when using regular sugar, I can't imagine ever going back.  There is simply no downside whatsoever.  Highly recommend this product.

review/summary: xylitol
review/text: I really like xylitol, it doesn't have a bad after taste like other sugar substitutes. I've tried just about all of them, even Stevia - can't stand the taste of it. The only drawback with zylitol is it doesn't mix in cold drinks - but I found a way around that. Put the zylitol in water, heat it up till it dissolves, and then put it in your drink - tried it in tea this way and it worked perfectly. It can give you gas and diarreah if you use too much - just use a small amount till you see how you react to it. This brand seems to be really good - never have had problems with it. As an added benefit it is good for your teeth.

review/summary: Great sugar substitute!
review/text: This is a great sugar substitute that is almost identical to sugar. I am very particular about having sugar in my coffee with no after taste and Xylitol is the only sweetener that I have tried that is identical to sugar. I like stevia better though for quick dissolving e.g. for salad dressings and cooking enhancements because it disolves better in cold cooking and it's aftertaste is covered up, but for hot foods such as putting it in cocoa and coffee there is an aftertaste but not so with Xylitol. Also I like the crunchiness of sugar which Xylitol has, and really have enjoyed eating strawberries dipped in it,  not to mention cinnamon toast. I only wish that they could manufacture the product with a more finer texture like the consisteny of cane sugar. Xylitol makes a great maple syrup when heated with water and mixed with maple flavoring. It dissoves very well with heat, great for syrup for corn fritters,french toast, and pancakes. I do not put a lot of syrup on my fritters since I am a little leary of it being so harmful to dogs(are we all that different?). This is my only worry. I have had no negative reactions though by using this product. I am very happy to discover Xylitol which came from other people's reviews.

review/summary: It's not exactly what I expected
review/text: Recently I switched my bad eating habits to good ones.  Part of that change was finding a sweentner which would not interfere with blood glucose levels much, and tasted good.  I went to a health food store, and this product was recommended.  I finally tried it on some plain cereal.  I expected something like the flavor of Splenda, or maybe Equal.  At first, it was sweet like sugar and it was noticable, but it did have an aftertaste.  It was like the old articifial sweeteners.  I tried using less another time, but the result was the same.  I sweetened some tea with it, and that wasn't bad.  So, overall, it takes some getting used to.  It's not bad for being healthier than regular sugar but don't expect to be "wowed."

review/summary: Xylitol tastes good. Erythritol doesn't.
review/text: Yeah, don't feed it to dogs. Ok, since I'm human and I don't own dogs and if I did I wouldn't be feeding them sweetened things anyway because dogs are carnivorous, I am very happy with this product.<br /><br />The only complaint I have is that the plastic bag my Xylitol came in (I bought the 1 lb size) had a very strong chemical odor. I moved the Xylitol to a metal bowl for storage. NOW should use packaging that doesn't have such a strong plastic off-gassing.<br /><br />Work your way into eating Xylitol (gradually increase consumption over a period of weeks) to avoid gastrointestinal issues. Also be careful of eating too much inulin and other products that can cause a laxative/bloating/gas effect.<br /><br />This tastes good unlike NOW Erythritol which tastes rather horrid, except when making bitter chocolate.

She even cooks with it.  I sparingly use it in green vegetables that tend to be bitter, but have not baked with it.  She loves it and so do I.  Have to be careful when you are a new user of Xylitol because the side effect of diarhea is real.  My son got it bad from putting it in his coffee the first time.  He uses more sugar than I do in my coffee.  Will order again

review/summary: Value!
review/text: This is a huge bag of xylitol.  We were buying the small bags of birch xylitol, but went looking for something else due to cost. We are a family of three and all of us love yummy, sweet, creamy tea. I was not loving the sugar, though! My husband is diabetic and I was worried about my son having all that sugar. Sometimes I still use honey with my son, but my husband has completely switched to xylitol. After extensive research I think that I am okay using non-GMO corn xylitol. Honestly, I can't tell a flavor difference and the price comparison is huge.<br /><br />Pros:  Very good value for your money!  Great for families or people who do a lot of cooking. Bakes like sugar in the recipes we have done. It isn't quite as sweet as sugar and since we've been used to using it almost exclusively our taste buds have gotten used to it. Now, when I go out and I am offered a treat, or get one at a restaurant, I can't take the sweetness. I've gotten so I never eat dessert or snack on sweet things. I just don't like them anymore. I'm healthier and my husband is healthier. My son, who is seven, also never snacks on sweet things or even asks for them (with the exception of ice cream, sometimes). I think this is because he is used to not having them around. If he wants a snack he usually asks for things like crackers and goat cheese or fruit. I only mention this about my son because I have noticed that his peers are always snacking on really sugary things, things that now make my taste buds shudder.<br /><br />Cons:  The large size is a bit unwieldy and the zip-lock type closure doesn't work very well, at least on ours. Since I am a stickler for not having our food open to the elements we have had to invest in a large container for food storage. The large, good quality, food storage containers are expensive, but it a one time cost. We also have a smaller container for general family use that we re-fill from the larger one.<br /><br />Overall:  I will definitely buy this again!

Still, my daughter began vomiting everywhere almost immediately.  She never normally vomits.  I think the intense sweetness triggered a kind of protective response in her body.  Perhaps she thought it was poison.  Anyway, don't be dumb like me and try it on your toddler.  Reserve this product for older children and adults.

review/summary: Better than xylitol gum.
review/text: Highly recommended for table sugar. I purchased xylitol gum for dental protection also.  But I think that putting a quarter teaspoon xylitol into my mouth and holding it there reaches far higher molar/molal (pun intended) concentrations, far higher than using gum as the delivery method.  15 pounds seemed like maybe too much until it arrived, when it seemed like not enough after giving a pickle jar full to grandpa and grandma, a jam jar full to work, several jars full to the kids, and using for most sugar uses. Feels slightly different than sugar in the mouth, seems to get very slightly cold when dissolving, tastes every bit as good as table sugar, to me a little better.

review/summary: My second bag from here.
review/text: It is a proven fact that sugar increases insulin levels which can lead to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes, weight gain, premature aging and many more negative side effects.In addition, xylitol does not promote an insulin response by the body. In contrast to sucrose, or table sugar, whose glycemic index is 100, xylitol's glycemic index is just six.The key to xylitol's benefits is that it helps to break down biofilms. Brushing with xylitol , chewing xylitol gum, or sucking on a xylitol pastille several times a day has an anti-biofilm effect, according to researchers. Without the protective biofilm, bacteria just can't adhere to the enamel and release corrosive substances that cause cavities. Additionally, the bacteria that cause periodontal disease have no place to hide in the gum recesses.

review/summary: Xylitol
review/text: Great product just don't go overboard using it too much because it may cause diarrhea in some people. However, this is an excellent alternative to sugar; and, it tastes just like sugar!

review/summary: I trust now foods to do xylitol right
review/text: . I once worried about something so sweet<br />actually having some sugar in it;<br />but if Now Foods is doing this right,<br />then there are great reasons to soak teeth in xylitol:<br />not only does it kill germs,<br />it feeds enamel at the same time .<br />. it's also a form of energy for bones<br />but eating more than 50g is hard on the liver .

review/summary: Can't taste it much....
review/text: It certainly doesn't have an after taste like Aspartame or Splenda or other substitutes, but it also doesn't sweeten.  I have put up to 6 packets in 32 ounces of tea and to no avail.  It also has a horrible tendency to all settle at the bottom (requiring constant agitation before drinking).  Not a fan.  Trying Stevia liquid drops next...

review/summary: Xylitol is good but Z Sweet has fewer side effects
review/text: Xylitol was recommended by my doctor to help combat a familial tendency towards diabetes. It is very much like sugar in taste and form - and offered a terrific way to deal with my preference for sweetened tea and coffee. (Several of my doctors specifically recommended that I do not use Splenda or any other artificial sweetners.)There are some gastrointestinal side effects to Xylitol however.<br /><br />A product called "Z Sweet" was introduced to me as an alternative to Xylitol ... Z Sweet uses Erythritol mixed with a bit of Stevia (though there is NO licorice aftertaste at all). Erythritol seems to have all the same advantages as Xylitol, but has fewer side effects. The taste is nearly identical - though I prefer the Z Sweet combo. If memory serves, Z Sweet/Erythritol is not dangerous to dogs.<br /><br />If you find Xylitol useful in your life, as I do, you might want to know about Eryithritol (or Z Sweet) in addition.

review/summary: Heat & Flavor
review/text: My husband won't use any other hot sauce but Gib's.  It is a great amount of heat with an equal amount of flavor.  It goes great with anything you can think of.  It's impossible to find in any store - even the "World's Largest Hot Sauce Warehouse" didn't have this brand.  I recommend buying at least a half dozen bottles at a time, because it makes the shipping more proportionate to the product, and you'll use it - I guarantee it!

review/text: This is absolutely the best relish-style hot sauce available.  I first tasted it at the restaurant, which closed several years ago.  It's great in cajun dishes, as well as in chili and on sandwiches.
