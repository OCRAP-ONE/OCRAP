review/summary: The Best There Is!
review/text: The only drawback to this product is that once you try it, you will never be satisfied with any other kind of oatmeal again!  Delicious!  Make it overnight in your crock pot if you don't have time to cook in the morning, and wake up to a healthy, hot breakfast.

review/summary: Try w/ chicken broth vs. water-yummy!
review/text: A friend of mine prepared this oatmeal in chicken broth instead of plain water saying you could then eat it plain w/o milk or sugar. I was skeptical, but it was incredibly delicious!!! It reminded me of coucous and I thought if I added some spices and pine nuts it could easily become a dinner side dish. Crazy, I know, but try it and you'll be amazed. Also, a local health food store sells this for $10/can, so this is a great deal.

review/summary: Doesn't get much better
review/text: Long time Oatmeal eater here.  I usually bought McCann's in the store, but it can get pretty pricey.  Amazon is a great deal, and you get free shipping.<br /><br />FYI, medium- to long-term is it unhealthy to consume steel-cut oatmeal UNLESS you soak it in warm water with something acidic between 12 to 24 hours, preferably some fermented milk product like yogurt, kefir, buttermilk, etc.  Reason being is that oatmeal contains in its hull enzyme inhibitors that have a chelating effect on your body, i.e., they remove metal from your body.  While short-term this may be beneficial (meat eaters stockpile extra iron, copper, etc. over time), medium-term this could lead to deficiencies in essential metals.  Soaking the oatmeal at least overnight neutralizes the enzyme inhibitors.  Additionally, it allows you to cook up the oatmeal in about five minutes, versus over 30 minutes when left unsoaked.<br /><br />This recipe follows the recipe in Nourishing Traditions, but basically soak one part oatmeal with one part lukewarm water.  Add a little bit of yogurt to create the acidic environment: I use one TBSP per 1/2 cup of oatmeal and 1/2 cup of warm water.<br /><br />Oatmeal should be eaten with some fat (many of the vitamins are fat soluble), so I add butter or cream.  I also add shredded flax and coconut, increasing the healthiness of my breakfast.  I then top it off with plenty of raw honey (also from Amazon), which sweetens my porridge and thus makes me look forward to breakfast in the morning.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Why do these taste SO good?
review/text: Oats is oats, right? Well, apparently not. These steel cut oats have a toasty, nutty, wonderful flavor that is distinct from steel cut oats grown elsewhere. The tin is of course wonderful; it keeps this slightly oily grain fresh and it can be used when empty for holding coins, treasures buried in the backyard or any other number of things.<br /><br />The oats take longer to cook than standard rolled oatmeal, but that's not a problem if you soak the oats, use a pressure cooker, rice cooker or plan ahead. We love these oats in winter with a dab of butter and a teaspoon or two of local wildflower honey. Good with salt and cream also.

review/text: BE CAREFULL!<br /><br />How much you pay for this will depend greatly on how you order it from amazon...  the way I ordered it was for a four pack that qualified for free shipping.  Otherwise, you're better off trying to find this locally.<br /><br />I used to have gloppy "instant" oatmeal for breakfast.  Not anymore!  I make this THE NIGHT BEFORE with a four to one ratio of oats to water, bringing the water to a boil and adding the oats, along with some cinnnamon and vanilla.  It takes five minutes.  I let this sit overnight, and when I get up in the morning I add a little milk and have the best damn breakfast you can imagine.  The cinnamon and vanilla allow me to use splenda instead of sugar for sweetener, and I have a healthy breakfast!  I eat this five or six times a week!  I can't recommend it highly enough!  Make sure you order the four pack that qualifies for free shipping!  Guys will find many, many uses for the tin that the oats come in!  Swanky!

review/summary: Dee-licious! (And healthy)
review/text: I hate instant oatmeal. I thought I hated ALL oatmeal until I tried Steel Cut. This has a great texture and is much healthier for you than that instant paste!<br /><br />When I make this I add a bit less water than most recipes call for. I make a big pot in my RICE COOKER which means I don't have to stir or watch a burner...so really no extra WORK than the instant.<br /><br />AND I make mine "instant" too! See, when I make a big pot (about 8 servings), I scoop out individual serving sizes into little Gladware containers. I add a little vanilla extract, half a packet of Splenda, a few apple slices, a few banana slices and....some dark chocolate chips. Then I freeze it! (Also nice because you don't have to have a fresh apple or banana on hand every time you want the oatmeal)<br /><br />When I go to work in the morning I grab one out of the freezer, zap in the microwave for about 3 minutes and voila! "Instant" oatmeal with great flavor, texture and toppings!!

review/summary: Simply Outstanding!
review/text: Wonderful product. "Instantly" puts all "instant oatmeal" (except McCann's) products in the trash heap. It does take 30 minutes to cook, but following the directions on the can (4 cups water, 1 cup oats) this makes four breakfasts (just under 1 cup of cooked oats each) for me; it might make 5 for smaller appetites.<br /><br />I make it in the evening by starting with the water and oats, with just a touch of salt in the water. Stir the oats initially, then set a timer and leave it be on very low heat (just barely bubbling). At the end of 30 minutes, stir well, then I divide the oatmeal into 4 equal parts (usually just under 1 cup each) and put it into those little Glad Serv-n-Saver type containers (the "Tupperware" you don't mind losing!). Into each container ("bowl") I like to mix a handful of raisins (or other dried fruit, but raisins are my personal favorite), a dash or two of cinnamon, about a tablespoon of honey and a tablespoon of ground flax seed. I then mix each thoroughly and cover; then all 4 "ready to heat and serve" bowls go into the fridge.<br /><br />Each morning, then, I pour about a tablespoon of skim or soy milk on top of the oatmeal, then microwave for 1min 20sec (your oven may vary, of course). Stir, and enjoy; I eat it right out of the Serv-n-Saver bowl, which cuts down on washing, too! It's a wonderful tasting, quick and HEALTHY part of your breakfast. It's high fiber, so it's filling, which tends to cut your overall caloric intake and it goes a long way toward the American Heart Association's recommended daily fiber serving; most Americans are woefully below this in their usual diet.<br /><br />I highly recommend this as a part of a healthy, low-fat, low calorie, low glycemic and high fiber diet. It helped me drop my total cholesterol level over 40 points (as part of a comprehensive diet plan) WITHOUT drugs.

review/summary: Simple RECIPE
review/text: Perhaps some of you are like I was... wanting to take advantage of the health benefits of oatmeal, but uncertain how to prepare it so that you and your family will actually eat it. After experimenting a bit, and reading lots of recipes, I've come up with a simple, yet tasty way to prepare McCANN's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal. Give it a try, and you may decide that oatmeal can be a healthy and delicious addition to your breakfast menu.<br /><br />Recipe:<br /><br />- Start by bringing 3 cups of water to a boil (about 3-4 minutes in the microwave).<br />- In a medium saucepot, melt 1 tablespoon of butter then add 1 cup of oats. Toast the oats on medium heat for about 3 minutes.<br />- Add the boiling water to the toasted oats and simmer for 25 minutes. Don't stir. It should get to a soft bubbling simmer.<br />If it boils to hard, you stove is set too hot, so turn it down or it will burn.<br />- Add 1 cup of milk (or can do with a mix of milk and buttermilk).<br />- Cook an additional 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.<br /><br />Makes 4-5 good size servings with excellent texture and consistency. It thickens once it sits a little bit. You can increase or decrease the milk to adjust the consistency as desired. You can also save it for up to a week in the refrigerator without much difference in taste. Just store in small sealed bowls. Each can of McCANNs oatmeal makes about 16-20 servings.<br /><br />Everyone likes to top and sweeten their oatmeal differently (sugar, brown sugar, maple syrup, raisins, etc.). Only add the toppings when you're ready to eat it, not before storing in the refrigerator. For my serving, I like to add 2 tsp of brown sugar, 2 tsp of maple syrup, a sprinkle of cinnamon, about 1/2 tbsp of butter, and then top with chopped pecans. I know it's not particularly healthy, but it is very tasty. Hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Please be kind enough to indicate if reviews are helpful.

review/summary: Taste great, more filling!
review/text: Steel Cut Oatmeal is a great way to start the morning. Not only do the steel cut oats taste better than instant but they also are slower to digest. You don't get the rush of blood sugar followed quickly by a return of your appetite like you do with the instant oatmeal. One caveat, all 4 of the cans I received were bent fairly badly. This was not a big deal to me because I figure one of the advantages of the cans is that it helps protect the product during shipment.

review/summary: Irish porridge
review/text: I just ate my first bowl of Irish porridge, as the can refers to it. It was chewy, nutty, dense, filling and delicious, just like all the reviews said it would be. It was easy to cook, the directions on the can advise to boil 4 cups of water and then add 1 cup of oatmeal. Simmer for 30 minutes exactly and it turns out perfect and serves 4, with 150 calories per serving. Each can contains 20 servings. Storing 4 cans was not an issue, considering each 28 ounce can is about as big as a quart of paint. My only gripe is that all the cans I received are badly dented, but if that's the trade off for the bargain price and convenience of purchasing from Amazon, I can deal with it.

review/text: If you've never eaten steel cut oatmeal, you are in for a surprise. This does not look like the Quaker products you may have been raised on, but it is wonderful. I kept reading in multiple sources how steel cut oats were better for our health, so I tried this product. It is great. Yes, it takes longer to cook, but it is well worth the wait. One of the best ways to cook this is to substitute apple juice for 1/2 of the water and then cook. Excellent!

review/text: Yes, this is good old fashioned porridge.  Order it in the UK and this is what you'll get.  It's oatmeal - NOT oats!  I throw a big handful of raisins in the pot while this is cooking and it adds to the taste.  When it's cooked, I add diced apples, walnuts, milk or yogurt, and sometimes a tiny spoonful of sugar for a breakfast that keeps me full and satisfied all morning.  If you are eating this as it comes right out of the can, you're eating the same oats that horses eat and even they like molasses with it!<br />You can 't get a better breakfast - cook it the night before and warm in the microwave if you don't have 45 minutes in the am!  It's great warmed up.<br />ps.  ordered this when it was on sale - and every can but one came dented!  What a shame because the cans are quite nicely made and great for storing other things after the oatmeal is gone.

I make a batch and keep it in the refrigerator for a few days, so I only have to cook it a few times per week.<br /><br />It is great with Smart Balance and Agave nectar sweetener, which by the way is a sweetener with a low glycemic index so it will not spike your blood glucose - good for diabetics and non-diabetics.<br /><br />Enjoy

I first encountered the term steel cut oats in an article and immediately rushed out to buy some, hoping for a miracle. Well, my husband fell in love with them. I still sat on the fence...I later discovered the McCann's in the grocery and the price was a real eye-opener (8.00 US) per can, but I splurged. We have never looked back. The quality is perfect. I can even eat them now and enjoy them. The price at Amazon is the absolute best. I am thinking of subscribing! McCann's rules!

review/text: The fact that I'm willing to cook oatmeal for 30 minutes in the morning is an indication of how good this stuff is.  We buy 4-6 tins every two weeks and there are only two of us at home.<br /><br />It's rich nutty texture tastes great on it's own.  I add a little brown sugar and sometimes a little cinnamon and nutmeg, although it certainly can stand on its own.  I don't add any milk, I don't think it needs it, but my husband likes his with milk.<br /><br />I wish I had discovered this in my youth.  I had hot cereal and eggs and toast every morning before school.  If this were the cereal, we could have skipped the eggs and toast.  The great thing about this, is that you are filled up and because it is natural, you are not hungry for hours.  No matter how hard you work, this keeps you going until lunch.<br /><br />I love this stuff and will buy it forever.

I take breakfast leftovers with me to work & eat it as a snack during the day (this helps keep me away from the donuts).<br />Oh, and another thing- go to the mccann's web site- they've got interesting recipes that you'd otherwise never think of, such as a savory oatmeal rissoto, which, I'd imagine, would work really well with this type of oatmeal.

While it takes about 20 minutes to cook, it is more than worth the time to have a smooth, creamy bowl of steaming authentic oatmeal.

The body and slightly nutty taste of McCann's oatmeal are far superior to any instant brand; no cardboard taste here. It's the real thing and a treat to treasure!

review/text: McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal is by far the best oatmeal I've ever had. It is nutty flavored and the texture is superb!  I like the fact that it is steep cut and not overly processed as well.  Our family will not eat any other type of oats!

review/text: OK, so it takes longer than the instant kind, but it is so good for you.  I always feel that I am starting my families day off write with these steel cut oats.  No one fights me at the breakfast table when it comes to eating this.  Great on a cold morning. Yummy, I mix vanilla soy milk into it.

review/text: McCann's is absolutely the best oatmeal available.  The packaging is brilliant; the tin keeps the oats fresh until you open it.  I eat this all winter.  I've been able to buy it in every town and city in which I've lived until now.  I won't eat four tins in a year, but because of the packaging, each will stay fresh until I need it.

review/text: While not so quick as 3 minute oatmeal, the wait is worth it, in my opinion. This was how oatmeal was meant to be enjoyed. I will never go back to the boxed variety. The texture is appealing and the taste has a slight hint of nutty flavor. Such a shame I had not tried this many years ago. I didn't know what I had been missing.

review/summary: Dented Cans- great product
review/text: First I will say that the oatmeal is a great tasting product. This is my second subscription delivery. This is the first time I have had dented cans. There are major dents.The lid will not fit on one can. A note about packaging: The cans were sent shrink wrapped with the lids off all the cans. The taste is not affected by the dents,as there is a foil seal under the lids.<br />I do not regret the purchase, and will continue to buy as I am unable to get the oatmeal otherwise.This oatmeal does not taste like the rolled oatmeal you see in the store. It reheats well after being cooked also. I have not tried the quick cook method yet.

review/text: This is the most delicious oatmeal we've ever had. It's got a hearty, almost nutty flavor.  It's more nutritious because it's not processed like other brands.  Well worth the price and the time. It takes some time to cook (about 30 min or so), but leftovers can be refigerated and warmed in the microwave and it still tastes great.

review/summary: Unique and healthly.
review/text: This  is one of the best things in the world for you to eat, and may well be THE best. This is old fashion oatmeal, and it takes a lot of time to prepare compared to Quaker oats. If you are a novice to this type of product, let me tell you how my Wife prepares it for convenient use. Get a rice cooker The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F3Q1I2">Sanyo ECJ-N100W 10-Cup Electric Rice Cooker with Porridge/Soup Cooker and Steamer</a> looks good, and use the porridge setting. You can use some old butter or whipped cream type plastic containers, and store the cooked oatmeal in the freezer. You can then nuke it in a few minutes for breakfast, or if you want a healthly late night snack. I know the purists will condem me for Americanizing this, but we are Americans... if it is not convenient we will not use it as often as we should.

Bring four cups of water to the boil, add one cup of oatmeal and simmer gently for 30 (yes 30) minutes. Add milk and honey, and you have a biblically good breakfast, nutritious, delicious.

review/text: I have not tasted this oatmeal yet but I do anticipate it to be very good.  It did not come as a four pack though.  It came as 4 separate cans that were not packed well at all.  They were loose without any packaging material in the over sized box.  All 4 cans came severely dented and look as though I purchased them from a bargain shelf.  The $10 S+H fee seems a bit steep for this type of careless packing.

review/summary: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal
review/text: If it were not for the LOUSY packaging, I would rate McCann's Irish Steel Cut Oatmeal 5 stars.  The oatmeal is delicious with a nutty flavor and I will never be able to eat regular oatmeal again after having tasted it.  Plus, it is so good for you.  My family loves the oatmeal.<br /><br />Having said that, however, the people or department responsible for preparing the oatmeal for mailing should be terminated. I have ordered three separate times and each time the oatmeal containers arrive damaged.  I even complained to Customer Service and all they did was send me more oatmeal free to replace what I had received.  The free shipment was also damaged. This oatmeal comes in these really beautiful tins that would be reusable in so many different ways, i.e., filling the tin with steel cut oatmeal cookies as a gift, but the cans are so dented up that you can't use them.  Fortunately, this does not affect the quality of the oatmeal, but I feel like I am being ripped off because none of the beautiful cans are salvageable.  Apparently this is not important to Customer Service (I have seen several complaints from other reviewers about the same thing) or they would do something about it.  I am going to try and find another source for this delicious oatmeal.

review/summary: It's all a matter of opinion, or taste buds!
review/text: I cooked this Irish porridge with Soy Dream soy milk instead of water, since my family and I like oatmeal (with rolled oats) with this milk, and let it simmer for 25 minutes. I added 2 tsps of brown sugar, as somebody suggested, and some raisins. I absolutely loved it, and devoured it in a couple of minutes, going back for more. My wife, however, did not like it, and said that the texture is like what she imagines it would feel like in your mouth if one were to eat bugs!!! So, as you see, it's all a matter of opinion, or taste buds. I imagine this product is one of those that, either you love it, or hate it! Enrique and Paula, Lakeville, MN

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: I've been an oatmeal addict for quite awhile, but it was always Quakers rolled oats, until i found steel cut oats. Much creamier and nuttier tasting. I do mine in a crock pot... 1 cup oats to 5 cups water which makes them come out a little creamier, also a pinch of salt. I tried the stove top method and forget it..lol..I dont have that much time to waste and I do believe that the crock pot method is better. I make enough and keep the rest in the fridge and just re-heat in the morning adding a little water.  I knocked off 1 star because of the price as I have gotten organic steel cut oats from my local co-op for about 1/3 the price. Overall a great product and a cool can.

review/text: I bought this after reading the raving reviews.  It is undoubtedly, healthy for you.  It also takes a lot of time to cook and you need to bring your creative side into the kitchen to make it palatable.  Since I now have several cans of this stuff (the cans are smaller than the photo appears, by the way, so check the size) to consume, I've purchased some sugar free jam to mix with it to give it (hopefully) a hint of flavor.  Quite frankly I just don't see the "wow factor" with this oatmeal.  I'm going to finish it since I bought it (although the idea did cross my mind to pawn it off on relatives as an unusual gift idea), but afterwards it is back to Quaker Oats for me.<br /><br />UPDATE 08/04/08:  I find it really interesting that when your opinion differs from the more popular ones, your review is considered "unhelpful" ;)

review/summary: Poor packaging
review/text: We were really looking forward to receiving and trying the oatmeal.  The 4-Pack arrived today.  The box in which they were shipped was busted up in a couple of places and the postal people had to tape it up.  One can was busted open and the oats were emptied out in the box. The other three cans were badly dented and the seam on one was coming open with oats leaking out.  I would have expected better packing for the type cans the oats come in.<br /><br />I will send another review after we've tried the oats from the surviving cans. This is a very big disappoinment and I hope future shipments will be packed better for shipping.  Please advise as to what type compensation you would offer.<br /><br />Hoping for better results in the future.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: From reading other reviews before I bought this item, I was expecting something other than what I got.  I love regular Quaker Oats; however, I had heard how much better steel cut oats were for you. I just tried them this morning and was very disappointed.  If you are expecting something that qualifies for "comfort food" like regular oats do for me, then don't order this item.  I was expecting something creamy and full of flavor; but I got crunchy, chewy, and bland.  I kept thinking the oats would soften; so, I cooked them an additional ten minutes.  They never did.  I guess I'll stick with my regular oats.

review/summary: Just buy it in the box, folks.
review/text: The ONE-STAR in no way reflects on the oats, folks--- McCann's gets 5 stars all the way with me- it's pretty much the only breakfast item I must always have on hand (I, too, recommend the crock-pot method- and also recommend freeze-dried fruit to add in- I really like the "Sensible Foods" brands that are available here.)<br /><br />The one-star rating is for the condition in which it was shipped:<br />I thought I'd pick up the cans of this breakfast staple to have something presentable out on the counter since I use it daily--- alas, don't bother.  I've uploaded a photo of how mine arrived- others have commented on this in reviews as well.  I'll probably pick up one nice tin locally instead (which is what I should have done to start with) and just go with boxed oats.

review/summary: Get educated, save $
review/text: Even at $6 per canister, this product is inexplicably overpriced. Let me explain why:<br /><br />Intro to Oats 101--Oats, in whole form, are known as groats. In an effort to cut down on cooking time (or eating time, for those on the run, who don't have the time or patience to chew @mouthful 20-30x), oats are refined into the following:<br /><br />  -steel cut oats--cracked into two or more pieces<br />  -oat flakes--flattened with an oat roller<br />  -oatmeal--same as flakes, but parboiled<br />  -instant oatmeal--more processed than reg. oatmeal<br />  -oat flour--milled into dust, for baked goods or as a thickening<br />  agent.<br /><br />This product fits into the first catagory.  Their claim of "guaranteed uniformity" is a coined phrase, meaning each cracked grain is the same size, a gourmet characteristic.<br /><br />All this being said, I am not aware of oats from Scotland or Ireland having any magical or mystical quality, outside of marketing hype or myth.  Truth be told, you could go to any health food store with a bulk bin (one sign of a conscientious health food store), buy whole oats, certified organic, for about $2 per lb., and crack your own oats with a grain mill (Corona brand, one time investment, about $70, lifetime expectancy), or in a blender. For those more ambitious, you could cook them whole, which involves soaking them overnight, then simmering for about 90 minutes. Do not be put off by the cooking time, it is unattended, with a flame deflector. Cooking becomes a chore because of prep time, not the time on the stove.<br />Why whole? Because any time you grind or crack a grain, there is nutrient loss and, to those open to more estoteric models, a loss of life force (a.k.a. "chi").<br /><br />I did buy this product, and as connoisseur of oats, I was not impressed, did not give the same energy boost as others. Did not taste fresh, either.<br /><br />Now, onto an advanced concept: if you truly want the "Rolls Royce" of oats, there is a brand called "Really Raw Oats". Why is this? Because the oats commercially available are partially steamed to protect against rancidity (oats are about 10% fat, albeit an exceptionally healthful fat).  How do I know this? Because a truly raw grain will sprout. Attempts to sprout other oats have been fruitless.<br /><br />The Really Raw Oats carry a price tag of about $11 per lb., but are worth it. Conversely, the product here, in my opinion, does not command the price point it seeks.<br /><br />p.s.  the best TASTING oats I had came out of Canada--when you dry-roasted them in a pan, it took on the aroma of vanilla--BLISS! Haven't seen them, however, since the mid 1990's. I purchased from Lynn Paterson, who was pictured in David Sergel's fine book, "Zen Shiatsu"<br /><br />Bon Appeite, Good Health and Caveat Emptor<br /><br />-Andrew

review/summary: Great Oatmeal, Poor Shipping
review/text: We eat 'slow cook' oatmeal, because it has more fiber and nutrients, so my wife is used to cooking our oatmeal longer.  Most people are used to instant oatmeal which you just add hot water to.  Neither slow cook or steel cut are like that.  So, if you don't like taking the extra time to cook your oatmeal don't get steel cut.<br /><br />The oatmeal has a geat flavor, and is very filling.  It may have a completely different texture from any oatmeal you'ver ever eaten.  Several people have stated that it has a nutty texture and nutty flavor, they're correct.  Our whole family loves the taste.<br /><br />My only complaint isn't with the oatmeal, but with Amazon's packaging.  Several other buyers complained about this, so I was aware of it.  They put the oatmeal in a box bigger than it needed to be and then didn't pack the oatmeal firmly.  So, the cans moved around and knocked into each other during shipment.  We ordered 2 (pack of 4) sets, and they were shipped separately, although they arrived one day apart.  Of the 8 cans we received only 4 made it without blemish.  One was badly dented, and 3 slightly dented.  So, if you are getting the oatmeal in the cans with hopes of giving them as gifts, or something along those lines, be aware that you may not be able to do so.<br /><br />All things considered I would buy the steel cut oatmeal again.

I cook it about 5-6 hours. (Overnight is a little too long.) So I cook it during the day, put it in a container, and reheat a serving in a bowl in the microwave in the morning. The advantage of this method is that you don't need to watch or stir while the oats are cooking since they don't stick to the bottom of the crockpot.

review/text: Two health articles I read recently recommended eating steel cut oats. After some research I came across the John McCann brand at Amazon which turned out to be a stroke of luck. It is truly delicious and I'm delighted that I signed up for a regular supply.<br />After cooking the recommended way for a few days I tried the suggestion made by another reviewer of boiling the four cups of water (I use two cups of water and two of low-fat milk - wonderful!) the night before, stirring the cup of oats in, putting a lid on and placing it in the refrigerator to 'cook' overnight. IT WORKS (thanks Amazon for reviews!) - though I prefer to leave it sitting out for an hour or so to cook in its own heat and then place it in the fridge before going to bed. Next morning all you have to do is heat on the stove or in the microwave (takes seconds!)and you've got a delicious, healthful breakfast with minimal effort.

review/summary: Don't be put off by the "slow cooked" title -- it can be fast
review/text: Forget the other tricks -- steel cut oats is something that could have been tailor-made to pre-prepare in the era of refrigeration.  About once a week or so in the evening when I'm in the kitchen cooking something else anyway, I partially cook up a pot of oats (I've always used McCanns, which is great, and I'm going to try some from the local health food store out of the bin -- I'll then decide whether to switch.)<br /><br />Anyway, 4 cups of water brought to a boil, 1 cup of oats added and simmered until the oats are just starting to get a little chewy, then turn off the heat and let it sit to cool.  Some extra cooking and softening will take place while it is cooling, but you want to leave them pretty chewy.  Then, into a sealed plasticware container in the fridge.  The amount of tending that is needed is minimal during this process -- just occasional stirring to keep it from sticking until the heat is turned off.<br /><br />Each morning, I scoop out what I want (for me, 2/3 of a cup), add a little water, stir it up, and microwave for just under a minute and a half.  Sprinkle on some cinnamon and freshly cut up fruit and raw slivered nuts. and you have about as healthy a breakfast item as you could want --  no more than a 2-3 minutes of morning prep time.  High fiber, complex carbs, no gluten, low calorie, and it stays with you all morning.<br /><br />Once you get into this routine, you'll wonder why you ever touched instant or quick oatmeal, or any rolled oats for that matter.  You'll learn to adjust how long you want the initial cook to be, how much water to add before microwaving, and how long to microwave depending on how soft you want the final bowl of oats to be, depending on your personal taste.  I feel more satisfied with a chewy oatmeal and think it tastes better a little undercooked, but to each his own.<br /><br />Only downside preventing 5 stars?  McCann's is a bit expensive compared to bulk steel-cut oats that is available to many, but a can goes a long ways, and is certainly cheap compared to most unhealthy "quick" breakfast foods.  Compare for yourself with what is in the bins at your local organic stores and decide for yourself if the extra price is worth it, but if you haven't eaten steel cut oats yet you owe it to yourself to try it.  Also, I've lived places where McCann's was the only steel-cut oats that could be found at the local grocer, so in a choice between McCanns and a cereal other than steel cut oats,  -- spend the money.<br /><br />This is basically the only grain I eat.  Another caveat -- I've never bought it through Amazon, but I would imagine that the quality is going to be very uniform for this product regardless of source.

review/summary: Steel cut where have you been all my life?
review/text: Like many people, I grew up eating Oatmeal for breakfast some days, especially during the winter months. My memories of it were not terribly fond though, as it was always soupy and weak. We always had to dump on the brown sugar or maple syrup to give it any flavor whatsoever.<br /><br />I continued to buy instant oatmeal through college and into adulthood, but would always use far less water than called for on the package, mainly just to give it some texture. I thought that was the best oatmeal could get.<br /><br />Then one day someone made me a bowl of steel cut oatmeal, and it was seriously like Oatmeal reinvented! For one it looks nothing like rolled oats--instead of flat little flakes these are like little pellets. When cooked, steel cut oatmeal gets an awesome "al dente" consistency that is both smooth and chewy. But more importantly, steel cut oatmeal has a wonderful rich flavor I've never tasted in rolled oats. I find that with this I only add a very minimal amount of sweetener (usually maple syrup but honey also works). Sometimes I add some cranberries or fresh blueberries if I have them, but it is perfectly delicious sans extras.<br /><br />Yes, it takes preparation, but it's the best use of my rice cooker I've found (ironically I use it more for oatmeal than I do for rice!). I just pour in the oatmeal and water the night before, set the cooker to porridge mode and set the timer for whatever time I want to eat. In the morning, I wake up to the wonderful smell of the cooking oats and by the time I'm dressed and ready for breakfast, they're all ready to go.<br /><br />I can't recommend these highly enough. They're really good tasting, yet good for you. Hard to beat that!

review/text: I've read many places and heard Dr. Oz say that the only oatmeal that really has the health benefits is steel cut oats.  I just love this stuff.  I make a large amount and eat it cold all week.  I use 8 cups of water, 1/2 cup non-fat dry milk, mix it, bring to a boil, and then dump in 2 cups of the oats.  Stand by the pot and keep stirring so it doesn't overflow the pot or stick to the bottom.  I love the flavor and the sort of crunch.  It would also be good with dried cranberries and some walnuts or slivered almonds.  It's a few pennies cheaper at Trader Joe but they don't always have it.  I've been eating it every day and thoroughly love it.<br /><br />EDITED TO GIVE A GREAT AND EASY WAY TO COOK STEEL-CUT OATS:<br />After a few batches, I have perfected this stovetop technique for steel-cut oats:<br />1. boil 4 cups of water in a pot on the stove<br />  (optional:  1/2 cup non-fat dry milk to up the calcium)<br />2. add 1 1/2 cups of steel-cut oats<br />3. bring to rolling boil again<br />4. cover tightly and let it keep boiling for a few seconds<br />5. turn off flame and forget about it.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long, under 1/2 hour I think but not sure, and the water is totally absorbed and you have the perfect combination of creamy/chewy steel-cut oats.<br /><br />You get enough for quite a few servings; not sure how many. 10 maybe??<br /><br />Nothing stuck to the bottom of the pot. What a delight.<br /><br />Much better than standing over the pot and stirring and much better than cooking in a slow cooker.<br /><br />(Learned this on egullet!)

review/text: This was a splurge purchase.  My wife knows that I occasionally will go on a health kick and eat oatmeal for breakfast.  She got me this almost as a gag.  I was very happily surprised by the quality.<br /><br />First, I like the retro packaging.  It looks like I'm going to have something "old school" for breakfast, from an era when my dad says that Grape-Nuts would "almost break your teeth".  It's silly, but the esthetics of food do play a big role in how much we enjoy it.<br /><br />Still, packaging wouldn't mean anything if the taste wasn't there.  Happily, these oats have more texture and flavor than any others I have eaten.  Will the taste blow you away?  Well, truthfully, no.  You could argue that "tastiest oatmeal" is kind of like being "tallest dwarf" or "smartest stooge".  This is also not a product to consider if you are feeding three teenagers on a budget.  What I would say is that if you like oatmeal and don't mind spending a bit more for quality, at least consider treating yourself to a can.

One taste of the rich nuttiness & chewiness of this porridge will convince you to ban rolled oats, especially the instant varieties, from your household. There is nothing instant about this product; it does take time to boil water, add the oats & cook for 30 minutes. The flip side is you can make a batch once a week & eat from it for several days by reheating a portion in the microwave...it truly is worth the effort.

review/text: Growing up in England porridge or "porage" if you came from Scotland was a staple food in our house, especially in winter, and although I never liked the traditional made with water and salt version, sugar or syrup were always an alternative for a healthy and filling (and warming breakfast)<br />Most oatmeal available here in the USA (including the instant microwave stuff) is a pretty stodgy, slimy affair, that even though it tastes OK for the most part, is a mile removed from this McCann's steel cut Oatmeal.<br />This stuff is far more granular (so you use less) robust, and tasty, almost a nutty kind of grape nuts texture that is flavorful and nutricious, as well as filling, with only the addition of some sugar or sweetener to personal taste.<br />I purchased 4, 28 ounce tins on a Gold Box deal, but even at full price, they are not as expensive as they may appear, given the price of most other breakfast cereals today, especially the high price "organic" tagged ones.<br />It does take about 30 minutes to make, so a lot of people will not like that compared to the convenience of "instant" oatmeal, but I see that some reviewers have some tips for shorter cook times with a microwave.<br />For me, I like the idea of the tin instructions if you don't have 30 minutes in the morning.<br />Bring 4 cups of water to the boil per one cup of oatmeal in a saucepan, remove from heat, cover and cool and put in the refrigerator overnight, then cook in the morning for about 9 minutes on stovetop. This actually makes the finished article a little softer than fresh made, but still great in taste and texture.<br />The above measures are for about 4 servings (3 if like me, you have extra!) and I only add 4 teaspoons (one per serving) to the mix of raw cane sugar while cooking for a nice grainy but little sweeter taste.<br />A no doubt 5 star review for probably the best tasting and healthiest oatmeal (or porridge) I have tasted. Try some!

review/summary: McCann's Steel Cut Irish Oatmeal
review/text: This is a wonderful product once you learn how to cook it. As a matter of fact, I am right now heating up the remainder of a three day supply. It gets better each day and I highly recommend making a larger batch and reheating it each morning. I add milk each time I reheat it and I originally cook it in skim milk rather than water. I use the short cut method on the can and it seems to work best. I tried the longer method and it just takes too long. We love the texture and the fact that there isn't any flaky pieces like in regular oatmeal that you can't eat. As for cost, actually it is quite reasonable compared to the other oatmeal in stores.

review/summary: Try Cooking it Overnight
review/text: I tried steel-cut oatmeal for the first time this week and I am hooked! I'll never go back to regular oatmeal again! I cook mine overnight in the slow cooker using a variation of Alton Brown's Overnight Oatmeal recipe, substituting raisins for the figs just because I like them better. My slow cooker tends to run hot so I put the temperature to "warm" overnight and then crank it up to "low" about an hour before serving (just enough time to have coffee and read the morning paper!).  My family devoured it and asked for more! Pretty good for folks who don't normally even eat breakfast!<br /><br />[...].

review/summary: It truly is the world's bestj oatmeal, healthy, steel cut and tasty!
review/text: I love this brand of steel cut oatmeal and so happy to have found it online. My doctor that treats me for hypertension recommended this as a daily breakfast item!  She is a clinical and research doctor and told me that she ate a bowl of McCanns steel cut every morning.  She emphasied not to get the instant or quick cooking McCanns (eventhough it is far superior to other brands of same product) but rather the original in the can item here.  I cook it in advance place in a closed container in the refrigerator and just take out as needed, it stays wonderful this way up to four or five days even a week when refrigerated!<br />Plus news of all news.... it is awesome for energy... I am not hungry mid morning and because I am satiated from the natural steel cut oats... I am not tempted by high sugar items!!!

review/summary: The BEST oatmeal, like a dessert for breakfast!
review/text: This is the BEST oatmeal anywhere on the planet! I found a quick and easy way to cook it for those that like lots of fruit. I use a 'fuzzy logic" rice cooker on the porridge setting (2 hrs.) but set my kitchen timer for only 25 minutes--which is all it takes to cook as it is a sealed rice cooker that steams the contents as it cooks. I use 1/2 of a rice cup measurer of oatmeal, 3/4 of a regular liquid measuring cup of water, 3/4 of a reg. liquid measuring cup of either cranberry, apple or pomegranate juice, then slice up a whole apple, add some dried cranberries, goji berries or other dried fruit and set the rice cooker. 25 minutes later when the oatmeal is done, I add walnuts--and perhaps more fresh fruit if you like. The fruit juice is sweet enough not to need sugar or any other sweetener! It is truly like a very healthy dessert for breakfast!

review/summary: Hardy Morning Goodness!
review/text: I've always enjoyed oatmeal for breakfast, but when I purchased my Sanyo Rice Cooker, it had a porridge setting, so I bought McCann's Steel Cut Oatmeal to try it out.  So much more flavorful than regular oatmeal!<br /><br />McCann's has rough cut bits of whole oats that cook into a hardy bowl of goodness that really stays with you through the morning.  Very satisfying.  I'll be keeping this on hand from now on!

review/summary: Wowee, Yum!!
review/text: This oatmeal is so delicious, and the texture is awesome.  The downside:  once you try this you'll never want that 'instant' oatmeal garbage ever again!  I have a small slowcooker:  I like to put in 1 cup of the oats and 4 cups of water, and then I put it on low to cook overnight. It's ready for me when I get up in the morning, and I have extra for later! For flavorings, I like to add a little salt, butter, cinnamon and sugar.<br /><br />What amazes me most is that it keeps me satisfied for so long.  With other oatmeals, I'd be hungry again within a couple of hours, or worse: still hungry when I finsh the bowl.  When I eat a bowl of this oatmeal, I'm good until lunch time, easily.<br /><br />And it's perfect winter comfort food!!

review/summary: Give it a chance, it grows on you
review/text: McCann's has a very different taste and texture than Quaker instant oats or other quick oat products, but it will grow on you.  It takes a few more minutes to make, so a little planning is required if you're an up & go kind of morning person, but it's worth it.  It's quite filling.  The tin cans are neat.  My first order arrived with one can popped-open and the oatmeal spilled into the box, but Amazon sent a new can, actually four new cans, at no charge.  And in many reorders I've never had that problem again.  Why shop anywhere else!

review/summary: Slow and inconvenient still the best...
review/text: I had been eating McCann's Quick & Easy (5-minute) oatmeal for some time, and it is really good.  I was mistakenly sent a batch of the traditional stuff (30 minutes), and I have to say it is quite a bit better.  So there you are.  I have found that by adjusting my routine it is not so difficult to give it the 30 minutes.  I won't be ordering the 5-minute stuff any more.  Highly recommended...

review/summary: True Porridge
review/text: McCann's Steel Cut oat meal is the best. With the steel cut you get a nuttier flavor. It's filling and the fiber in the steel cut doesn't cause that bloating gas feeling. It doesn't have the oat flakes you find in regular oatmeal and at first glance you'll wonder why they call it oatmeal, but this is the real thing.<br />Since you have to cook it for 30 minutes (enjoy the aroma)you can make a big batch ahead and just heat with milk as you need it. I cook a weeks worth and just take out my morning portion, add skim milk and microwave for two minutes. Add honey and you have the best porridge you'll ever taste. The price is right too. If it was good enough for the Chicago's World Fair in 1893 (Columbian Exposition), it's good enough for me.

review/summary: ALMOST AS EASY AS INSTANT OATS
review/text: Traditional oatmeal is an acquired taste which more people are acquiring because of the health benefit. McCann's is the easiest to find and to my taste the best.  (Quaker has put out a steelcut product which is not bad).<br /><br />The drawback is cooking, it takes a long time to cook.  My grandmother used to cook it in a doubleboiler overnight.<br /><br />There is an easy way.  The night before put 1/4 cup of oats to each cup of water in a saucepan, add salt, bring to a boil stirring occasionally. Turn off heat from anywhere from 30 to  90 seconds after reaching a boil, cover. In the morning  it is ready to eat, you can heat it in microwave or on the stove or eat it room temperature.

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: My 3-year old asks me to make this nearly every Saturday morning. We all love it. I have no problem with the 30-minute cooking time. Just start the pot of water boiling first thing after wandering into the kitchen. Do your usual other morning tasks while it cooks. Before you know it it, oatmeal is done.<br /><br />This porridge has been our little Saturday morning tradition for more than a year ever since we read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735814414">Good Morning, Little Fox</a> which involves a mom cooking porridge. Amazon's price for this item is much better than any of my local grocery stores' prices.<br /><br />We add a little milk and either brown sugar or fresh or dried fruit. It's summer now so we put slices of fresh ripe peaches in the bottom of the bowl before adding the hot oatmeal and a little milk. It does not have to be over-sweetened to make it taste good. I had no problems with the tins being shipped that was reported by several other reviewers.

review/summary: Yum  Yum  Yum
review/text: I love this oatmeal for many reasons but the the best are the taste and the chew factor.  You really feel like you are eating a meal. I make a batch of this twice a week.  I cook it only 20 minutes and then I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1&1/2 teaspoons of cinnamon stir and put a cover on it and let it sit for 15 minutes or so, off the heat, to finish.  This also helps so it doesn't stick to the pan.  No comparison to Quaker oats. So healthful and yummy.  I am on Weight Watchers and 1 cup of cooked oatmeal with 1/2 cup 1% milk, 1/8th oz. almonds (3 chopped), 2 dried apricots chopped, and 1 Tablespoon dried cranberries = 4 delicious filling points.

review/summary: Some Good Eatin!
review/text: I generally like oatmeal. Did an Amazon search and came up with this product and bought some just to try.  This stuff is GREAT.  I tried the crock-pot overnite receipies as well as the stove top.  IMHO, the stove top method is by far the best.  If you like, add in some dried cranberries or raisins towards the end of the cooking process. I prefer mine serverd with a little brown sugar and some 2% milk.  BTW the leftovers hold up nicely and reheat well in the microwave.

review/summary: Tasty oatmeal
review/text: The flavor and texture of this oatmeal is different from rolled oats.  It's nuttier and the oats are still somewhat chewy after cooking.  I agree with the reviewer who likes both ... depending on the weather or mood.<br /><br />You do have to follow the directions on the can ... it takes about 35 -40 minutes on the stove.  It has to be watched at first so it doesn't boil over, but as others have said, it's worth the effort.  I've tried the microwave, but it doesn't work there because it boils over even on low setting in a very high dish.  Old fashioned rolled oats cook up swell in the m.w. - 3 minutes on high.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  The tin is terrific and will be useful for other treasures.

review/summary: Best Oatmeal I've Found
review/text: McCann's deffinatly deserves all of the awards it has won, plus it has adorable packaging.  That great tin is practacle too, most oatmeal comes in cardboard boxes that are easy for pantry pests to get into, but not this sturdy well sealing tin.<br /><br />If you are in a rush, this may not be the oatmeal for you, buy McCann's instant instead.  But if you have the stirring time deffinatly buy the original.  It takes a little while to cook, but it is evenly cut so it cooks evenly, unlike some of the other brands I've tried.  One of the things I love about this oatmeal is all the wonderfull ways you can flavor it.  To get you started there are basic cooking instructions on the can.  This oatmeal is healthier for you, it has a relatively low glycemic index, plus it has naturaly accuring protien, perfect for a carb junky like me.  Make a big batch and save some for reheating on mornings when you have less time.

review/summary: Delicious, nutritious and sooo good.
review/text: Homemakers on a tight budget, take note.<br />My little secrets for super, tasty and very economical breakfasts.<br />Take one egg, beat it well in a simple stainless bowl, thoroughly coat a portion (1 cup) of oatmeal. Using a large fry pan, with a little dab of earl, on medium to high heat, CONTINUOUSLY stir fry kernels until they are separate. Three to ten minutes, depending on the heat output of your stove.<br />To make it toothy, I add only a  tad over 3 cups of water. Ten minutes on the lowest heat (covered) and let it sit a few hours left to cool down. No point enriching the utility company and/or spoiling good food by making your fridge work past its capacity.<br />Important. Do not stir at all, period, basta, etc.<br />Having done so, creates a bit of a nice toothy textured meal.<br />Overnight in the icebox. Formula can be safely doubled for larger broods.<br />Garnish with maple syrup, honey, fruit etc. Use your imagination.<br />I generally stopped using white sugar almost 40 years ago. Although I am not an academic, and ain't gotten any degrees, empirically, it appears to me that white sugar avoidance does NOT kill you, it may even possibly be good for you. Use your good judgement and lead by example.<br />An exotic and excellent treat for children of all ages.<br />Heads and tails better than anything "Quaker".<br />BTW: This is the same way I prepare another of my favorite breakfast treats which should appeal to any good cook, namely , buckwheat (kasha).<br />A final comment, using Amazon auto reorder, this has to be one of the best and cheapest ways to provide a proper breakfast.<br />Enjoy and prosper.

review/summary: restaurant style oatmeal in your home
review/text: Our family began a search for this oatmeal after having it served at a lovely, popular hotel.  It was not until later that we all shared the fact that we loved it so much, but by then we were home.  Many phone calls later, we discovered the name, and found it on Amazon.<br />Now that we have begun to use it, there are so many ways to use it besides the typical boring sounding oatmeal. Try it in breads, make it for a healthy desert, fruit adds lovely touches and the creaminess is one of it's hot points. You can use any kind of milk, soybean milk and the wonderful tasting almond milk. Yes, for those of you demanding instant oatmeal, have at it.  But, it seems obvious McCann's is a healthier choice all around, so the extra time is worth it.  We make large batches at night, cool it and refrigerate it in tupperware for an easy breakfast to heat in the microwave.<br />There is the unique rich nutty flavor, very fresh tasting.  It is packaged in an attractive old fashioned can that I like as it is resistant to moths and pantry pests.  My husband uses the empty cans for all sorts of organizational projects in the garage.  Please give it a try, and then explore the way you like it best.
