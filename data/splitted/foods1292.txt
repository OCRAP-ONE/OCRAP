review/summary: Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea
review/text: Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(

review/summary: Wakes me Up Without Making Me Jittery and Tastes Good Too
review/text: Stash Green Chai tea is very tasty, especially when it's mixed with some milk and honey.  Even better, it has the perfect amount of caffeine for me--just enough to wake me up without making me sweaty and jittery like coffee does.<br /><br />The individually-wrapped, foil-packaged tea bags are convenient, even if that much packaging does seem like overkill.  The packaging allows me to take a couple of tea bags with me wherever I go, just in case I get stuck in a boring meeting with no other beverage options except for nasty office coffee or plain hot water. . . Yes, I'm too cheap to go to Starbucks!

review/summary: Love it!  Nice, smooth tea
review/text: I normally really dislike mint tea.  Usually it has a lot of peppermint and is too strong.  But this one is milder and has spearmint, predominantly.  Not strong, though, and very, very smooth.<br /><br />A bit of honey or sweetener is nice with this one.<br /><br />I don't get distinct tastes of other things that they put in the tea -- the flavor is more of a gestalt.  It is a mint flavor that is more complex than the typical strong plain mint tea.<br /><br />Very, very nice.

review/text: I'm always seeing everywhere how good green tea is for you and how we should all be drinking it (not too exciting though, I know).  I stumbled across this Stash tea variation that combined my favorite (Chai) WITH green tea.  Now I can get some daily green tea down as recommended along with my daily chai fix -truly a perfect union.  I had no idea such a combination even existed -how could I go wrong?!  Needless to say, it has quickly become a new favorite.  :)"

review/summary: Jasmine
review/text: I love this tea. I used to buy loose jasmine green tea but this bagged variety is much more economical and tastes almost as good. It's great for people that are not big fans of traditional green tea, since it is much lighter and more flavorful. I don't even add any sweetener I like the plain taste just fine. The caffeine content is not as high as the one of coffee, or even regular green tea, which makes this a good beverage choice at all times of the day.

review/text: This is a good product.  But I thought it was not as smooth as Tzao (sp?) or even Bigelow Organic Green Tea (from Sam's Club).  The Bigelow is also much less expensive (175 bags for about $7.00).  I've had better tea than all of these in Asia, but don't know the brand names.<br /><br />Also, if you go to China or Japan, green tea is usually not green.  It varies from dark brown to pale green, including many shades of amber depending on growing conditions, processing and harvesting time.<br />[...]

review/text: I really like this tea.  Its really nice iced and hot, and has a sweet aroma as you open the packages.  My grandmother went to morrocco and really liked the tea there, and even she thought that this was good stuff.  The only thing I have to say that's negative would be the box design makes it difficult to grab the packets from the little like half circle opening, just open up the back otherwise they get all messed up and you have to push your fingers and root around trying to grab one of them and then pull them out etc.  Really good tea for a really nice price.  Even though I just bought 6 boxes, I would buy this again for sure (me and my family have already gone through three, and I gave one away as a gift).

review/text: I drink this tea every morning and have it on automatic order for a box of six packages every month.  I do find that I have to steep it just a little longer in order to get the pretty redish pomegranate color and flavor to come through. A friend calls it fruit juice.  I wouldn't go that far, but it does have a lovely flavor. It is my favorite Stash Tea.

review/text: I really like this tea.  I tried all the stash Fushion ones and liked this one best.  To get the full flavor you have to steep it for a long time. This tea also makes a great ice tea.  I make it like regular and then put it in the fridge when it cools down. You can use 2 tea bags in a standard tea pot and it makes a great strength of tea.  The listing says only 5 left, nearly out of stock, does this mean it's being discontinued? I am frustrated with Stash coming out with new flavors left and right and stores can only stock so many. Every time I find one I like, the stores stop carrying. I hope this continues to be available from Amazon.

review/text: My Chihuahua, Chiquita, loved those Hartz chicken chews and it never occurred to me that she would one day die as a result of eating those chicken chews.  I used to give her those chews a few times a week throughout her entire life, then one day when she was 15 years old she got real sick right after I had given her one of those chicken chews, and she was lethargic.  I took her to the vet and they said she had developed Kidney Failure.  That was the beginning of the end for her.  The results were from the Hartz chicken chew that I had given her...and it was Melamine Poisoning.  In back of the Hartz package it says, "Made in China."  If you are reading this, you may want to read the following website from the FDA:<br />[...]<br />Chiquita died from Kidney Failure, and all it took was one Hartz chicken chew that had Melamine to destroy her kidneys...and it came from China.  (I trusted the Hartz product that I bought, and Chiquita trusted me.)

When I forgot to order more food and had to get another natural brand at the pet store, my dog turned her nose up at it and waited until we got the Hi-Tek in the mail (the next day) to eat!<br /><br />I don't know what I would've done without Hi-Tek!

review/summary: Drastic cost increases!
review/text: My 4 stars is for the original price!!! I bought a 35# bag of Hi-Tek Naturals Lamb Meal for Less Active and Large Breeds in 10/6/12 for $36.80. Only a week later it is OVER DOUBLE this price ($76.34 on 10/11/12)?? It is a good dog food, but for $36! It is not worth over 75 dollars! I hope they get such a decrease in revenue that they revert to their original price.<br /><br />As for this food itself, I do like Hi-Tek brand and have tried multiple foods. My dog likes all of them fine, and her stools are smaller, less frequent, less smelly. The fat content of this Less active formulation is 12% as opposed to the normal 16% ( Hi-tek chicken meal with sweet potato is my comparison, $47.38 for 30# on 10/6/12, $45.99 for 30# 7/7/2012). However, the protein is decreased from the normal food - this one is 21% and normal food is 32%. I believe this is a reflection in the decrease of the quality of ingredients. The first five ingredients in the Less active formulation are: Lamb meal, pearled barley, white rice, brown rice, whole milo (another grain) followed by pork meal and some vitamins. Seems to me, a smart person would just buy the regular food and add some rice! The first five ingredients of the regular formulation are: Chicken meal, sweet potato, peas, pork meal, egg followed by duck meal, salmon meal, and a bunch of fruits and vitamins.<br /><br />Bottom line: love Hi-tek, kinda upset about the price changes, this food is not worth a penny over the original formulation even though you get 5# more. In this food they just cut protein sources and fruits and added more "filler" like rice.

review/text: These pretzels are evil. When my snacking comes to an end, I see flashes of myself laying on the unkempt wooden floor of an abandoned house. Scant beams of light burn between the cracks in the boards on the lone window frame, illuminating my tattered and orange-stained clothes. The sound of my body writhing over a pool of empty yellow aluminum bags, a half foot high up the empty broken walls, is quieted only by the echo of my cries of longing and despair.

review/summary: These are awesome, fatty, and flavorful.
review/text: These little pretzel pieces are totally addictive, which is probably not a good thing because they're a lot worse for you than you'd think pretzels should be. They have around 60 fat calories and 3 grams of saturated fat in ONE ounce, which equals out to be 15% of your daily sat fat intake per serving (one ounce).<br />The reason they're so good AND so fatty is that the mustard/onion seasoning is in an oil that permeates through the shell of the pretzel, making them extra flavorful and not dry at all. They're a little sweet, have good mustard flavor, and the onion flavor even comes through a little (they taste like they're supposed to). I try to just grab a handful at snack time and quit while I'm ahead, but I usually end up going back for more later.<br />If you're willing to put up with a little extra fat for a lot of extra flavor, these are a perfect snack.

review/text: If you like pretzels and you like hot wings. Do yourself a favor and try these. You will not believe how much like a true hotwing they made these pretzels taste.<br />Oh and to the 3 star reviewer who didn't like that they are hot. Umm they don't call them cool wings. They are not hot, but do have a spice to them. If you are someone that eats hotwings you will love them.

review/summary: Can't stop eating these puppies!
review/text: I love buffalo wings; not just the heat, but the flavor! This product, while not offering tongue-burning, sinus-clearing heat, has good bite to it. The flavor--how can I describe it? It's very addictive! I can down a whole 10 ounce package in no time. I'm not sure if I'm imagining it, but there seems to be a hint of a bleu cheese taste in there as well, which adds to the whole "hot wing" experience of the snack, in my opinion.<br />My kids like these as well. I have to hide the bag from them sometimes just to ensure that I get my fair share.

review/summary: Maybe too delicious?
review/text: Snyder's Honey Mustard & Onion Prezel Pieces might very well hold the title for most delicious non-candy snack item.  A large bag rarely lasts a day in my house, which isn't a good thing when they're pretty caloric.  They're so delicious you just want to stuff a whole handful in your mouth and slowly suck the flavor out of them, crunching on the remains as you look like a mad squirrel.<br /><br />I would go as far as to say that you could eat these every day and not get tired of them.  I would replace every meal of the day with these things if I wasn't afriad of them giving me heart disease.<br /><br />Try them once and you'll be hooked.  I have tried the other flavors since some stores run discounts, none of the other flavors were anywhere near as good as the Honey Mustard & Onion.  Buttermillk Ranch is ok, but you can't top Cool Ranch Doritos.  Cheddar Cheese wasn't good at all, and Buffalo Wing was hard to eat (flavor makes your hands all nasty).

They are a product that actually delivers on their promises.  They are hot and spicy, but not in the bland heat just to say they are spicy of so many other products.  These have the heat and the vinegar tang of actual buffalo chicken wings.  I love them.  Unfortunately they don't last long at our house.  Once a bag is opened they are gone as the burst of heat you get from them is addictive. The only downside aside from the speed at which they get eaten is the orange fingers you get from them.  But that is a small price to pay for entrance into flavor heaven.

Everybody I know who has tasted them raves about the flavor.  I don't think you could have found a better combination of flavors to add to a pretzel.  I've tried Hanover's other flavors but they don't come near this all time favorite.  I did have to stop buying and eating them because of health reasons, but when I did eat them, I would not be without any in  my house.

review/text: These taste great and they are my snacking weakness! however, they get on my nerves because the non-uniformaly shaped pieces exhibit the brazil nut effect where granular particles of similar/equal density tend to be on top aka the larger pretzel pieces tend to be in the first handful but as you eat more the smaller ones are always on the bottom of the bag no matter what you do. frustrating but unavoidable. just be aware.<br /><br />snyder should get a better pretzel chipper machine or whatever they use and keep the size consistent! if it works for potato chips why can't it work for pretzel???

I agree with this claim, my family agrees with this claim, my son's family agrees with this claim; as a matter of fact, everyone I've shared these pretzels with agrees with this claim.<br /><br />These are hard, sourdough pretzel pieces.  I'd guess the average size is 1/2" x 3/4" - 1"  of all different shapes because they are randomly broken. I ordered these using Amazon's subscribe & save program which brings the price down to less than I'd pay in the supermarket. Twelve packages are a lot.

review/text: Very flavorful, jalapeno is a fantastic concept for Pretzels. Random bags yield random results, the first pretzel in your mouth is an awesome experience, for the most part.<br /><br />But, for crying out loud, why do they have to add an YEAR'S WORTH OF SALT in one friggin bag?!! It's not consistent, sometimes you get lucky with the top portion of the bag when it's not all that salty, but by the end of one bag, you do get the feeling that you have consumed an ocean's salt content. Why this idiocy? When all one craves for is the taste of spicy jalapeno? The sucker that I am, I eat the first couple of pretzel pieces and then throw the whole bag away, it's serious sodium poisoning if you do consume the whole bag.

review/summary: Not the best Snyder's of Hanover Pretzels
review/text: Snyder's of Hanover makes good pretzels (Honey Mustard & Onion is my favorite), but these are just not appetizing at all.  "Hot Buffalo Wing" gets its kick from dried cayenne pepper sauce.  So if you are a fan of peppers you might like this pretzel.  They are nowhere near as good as Honey Mustard in my opinion, though they aren't as bad as just cheddar cheese.  Hot Buffalo seems to be enhanced by eating them with other food, in my case, chocolate M&M's.  If you like a spicy zing, try these pretzels, they are not horrible.  If you like sweetness just stick to Honey Mustard & Onion.  Nutrition-wise, are not the best as they contain MSG and caramel color.  Also, if you consumed an entire 10 oz. bag in one sitting, you would be consuming 1400 calories.  I guess their good if you are trying to gain weight like I am trying to do.  Otherwise stick to the healthier counterpart of the unflavored ones.

review/text: I had to work in Turkey through New Year's evening this year at a remote warehouse / office for my company's franchise there. Desperate for coffee in the off hours, a co-worker and I searched the canteen cupboards and found a container of this exact coffee and some sugar. We actually made it in a microwave on low power stirring and watching and, amazingly enough, it came out extremely well. If you like authentic Turkish coffee, this is the real thing and it's as easy to make as hot chocolate.

review/summary: good in shakes, but not plain!
review/text: If this had the same amount of calories as ice cream, or even frozen yogurt, I would be giving the product 1 star. However, part of the appeal of Arctic Zero is that it is so low in calories. It is important to note that this is not ice cream nor does it taste like ice cream. I found that when I ate it straight out of the carton, it had a slightly weird aftertaste.<br />My advice to anyone who orders Arctic Zero is that you should go into it with the idea that you're going to get a frozen protein shake rather than the idea that you're going to get an amazing ice cream for only 64 calories for a cup. That would be too good to be true.<br />While I wouldn't eat Arctic Zero (at least not the chocolate peanut butter, which is the only flavor that I've tried) plain, I found that it does make for a good base for shakes (although, I would probably not purchase this product again). When I mixed it with a few other ingredients like milk, ice, fruit, cocoa powder, better 'n peanut butter, etc. I found that the strange aftertaste disappeared and I was left with a distinct chocolate flavor with a hint of peanut in the background.<br />Again, I will warn you, do not spend the money for this product if you're hoping to find a low calorie ice cream substitute. As I stated above, that's not what you're going to get!<br /><br />Edited to add: I have to add one thing that I'm hoping that I'm wrong about. I'm wondering if the company is writing some product reviews to encourage (or mislead) others to buy their product. I certainly don't want to point the finger at anyone. However, I find it hard to believe that there are so many reviews that state that the product tastes like a rich and decadent desert. I find it hard to believe that anyone would claim that this product is mind-blowingly good or that it could be compared to regular ice cream, unless they had something to gain by doing so. Read the reviews for yourself and pay attention to the dates in which they were written as well as the fact that the good reviews seem to be rated as helpful, whereas the bad reviews are frequently either rated as unhelpful or are commented on by someone who seems to be invested in Arctic Zero. Perhaps I am wrong, as I have no real evidence to support my assumption. However, something doesn't seem quite right, and that needs to be addressed considering how pricey the product is.

review/text: I was very excited to receive arctic zero but unfortunately it did not meet my expectations.  I completely agree with another reviewer that said it tastes like a frozen protein shake...which isnt bad mind you but not worth the price in my opinion.  I am not interested in eating the pints right from the freezer with a spoon but they  do make a tasty breakfast when mixed with shake mix ins like fruit, milk, ice, cocoa, pb2 etc.  Its not offensive at all, just not delicious and yummy.  I like large portions and I'm health conscious ..so the volumetrics way of eating appeals to me... but in this case, I'd rather have a 1/2 cup of light ice cream than a pint of arctic zero.  Great concept but I will never crave it.  Unlikely I would buy again.  Sorry. BTW I never wrote an Amazon review before but I felt compelled to do so.

review/summary: Chocolate!
review/text: I've tried all the Artic Zero flavors, and the Chocolate is my favorite! I can eat it a whole pint at a time. The chocolate Peanut Butter is "OK", but I wish they could make it actually have a peanut butter taste. I couldn't tell there was really any peanut butter flavor at all. The Vanilla and Strawberry Banana I can't even eat on their own. I've used them in a smoothie to save ice cream calories, but don't think they are worth the extra expense. So, I've stopped buying anything but the Chocolate flavor, which I re-order every few months. I've also tried the Pumpkin Spice flavor, that one bombed too. I just ordered their Chocolate Mint Cookie flavor and can't wait to give it a try! I have high hopes for that one! But if your on the fence of what to buy, try their Chocolate and Chocolate Peanut Butter combo and decided which you like better from there.<br />3 stars, because it doesn't have the "real" ice cream texture you would expect, but for the calories it helps me get my ice cream fix!  And the Chocolate flavor is better.<br /><br />P.S. sometimes there are occasional problems with some of the pints arriving a little soft and melted. After sticking them in the frezzer to re-freeze, when you go to eat them they can have an icy texture. This is unfortunate, because of how expensive they are. I don't want a single bit to go to waste! But since I can't find them locally, I have been willing to just deal with it.

review/summary: Disappointing.
review/text: Sometimes, Amazon.com reviews lie, and they lie big time, but that's just me.<br /><br />During a recent trip to Whole Foods, a product in the freezer case piqued my interest: Artic Zero Chocolate Peanut Butter All Natural Frozen Dessert. At 32 calories for a half-cup, I was jazzed. After all, you can't even find sorbet that is that low calorie and is gluten-free and natural. I mean, 150 calories for the entire pint? I might as well eat the entire thing, and maybe that's what my plan was in purchasing it.<br /><br />So, over Shabbat last week, Tuvia and I cracked the pint open, and scooped out larger-than-1/2-cup portions and dug in ... to disappointment. Tuvia originally said that it was "bland" and mostly flavorless. I said it tasted like nothing but creamy peanut butter, straight out of the jar, which is my least favorite thing on the planet (I'm a crunchy kind of girl). And the chocolate? Non-existent.<br /><br />Eighty-five Amazon.com reviewers gave the product 4 out of 5 stars, which, let's be honest, shocks me. This stuff isn't worth it. A few bites in, we were both disappointed and uninterested. We chucked the rest of the pint and probably won't venture down the Arctic Zero road again -- even for a quick sweet-tooth craving.<br /><br />Bummer.

review/summary: No worries about finishing this pint.......because you won't want to
review/text: If you can trick yourself into thinking that Arctic Zero is a real treat, then more power to you. I can't. The texture is like ice cream that melted and was then refrozen. I usually take those back for a refund. But the worst offence is that there is very little taste. It's like eating a pint of ice with one drop of flavor on it. I took about 10 bites and couldn't go on. It's been sitting in my freezer ever since. I think the problem is that there is ZERO fat in the product. Fat is critical to taste. The manufacturers would be better off trying for a 250 calorie per pint mixture that includes a little bit of fat to help boost the flavor. If you're looking for a lo-cal treat, I'd suggest a couple of organic apples, which have about the same number of calories and the same volume.

I wasn't expecting a lot because 128 calories a pint? That's unheard of!  I couldn't wait to get my hands on this "ice cream". When I got it, I actually paid $15 for 3 pints. That is completely ridiculous, but I thought it might just be worth it. When I got home, I pulled out my spoon and took the first bite...not quite as what I had expected. Its very weird tasting, not like ice cream at all. I took a look at the nutrition label, and what really caught my eye was 9g of sugar per half cup. That's too much for being that bland tasting. Also, the nutrition label is WAYYYY off on here like said in a previous post, pretty much 2x more the calories. Don't waste your time or money.

No, not the same texture as full fat ice cream, but face it- you're eating a PINT of ice cream for 150 calories, for that alone, it rules. The only one I don't really like is the strawberry/banana.  If you do get it, before you eat it let it sit out of the freezer for about 20 minutes, other wise it's very hard.

review/text: For a low calorie ice cream-like protein supplement, this is an awesome product. I also felt that it was not as flavorful as I would want, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  I added a few drops of toffee flavored stevia and a little cocoa powder to the chocolate flavor and it totally rocked.  Had to let it defrost slightly in order to stir the stuff in, but if you want the sensation of ice cream without the fat and calories and *no soy*, Arctic Zero is definitely the way to go.  I am extremely glad to finally find a good product that is not loaded with soy.  I wish it were less expensive because I will absolutely be buying this again, many times.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: I first read about Arctic Zero on the Hungry Girl website. I was really curious about it so I started looking for it at my local grocery stores. None of them carry it, and the nearest place that carries does so on the shelf is about 100 miles away from where I live. I had hesitated to purchase ice cream that was this expensive... Let's be frank, $45 for 6 pints of ice cream is ridiculous when you can buy the same quantity at a fraction of the price at the local grocery store. However, the curiosity got to me and I caved in and ordered 6 pints of the chocolate peanut butter. I've been dieting since the beginning of the year (60 lbs down so far) and it's precisely this type of product that I keep an eye out for; low calorie and high quantity. Up until now having a frozen treat meant having a Skinny Cow or a Weight Watchers product, or some of the fat free stuff. Arctic Zero is wonderful if you are trying to limit your calorie intake and want to be able to indulge. The flavor, in my opinion, is sweet, but not powerfully so. I think that the texture is similar to fat free ice cream. (Many reviews here have said that it's like a frozen protein shake... I can't verify that because I've never had a frozen protein shake.) While I will admit that Arctic Zero won't satisfy you if you're looking for something like a pint of Ben and Jerry's, it's great if you're looking for something that will fit into a healthy lifestyle but won't make you regret eating the whole pint. (I'll admit that I did just that after I opened the first one up.) I'll be ordering more (even if sparingly due to the high price).

I can totally detect it...however, I feel that I have really sensitive taste buds (I can detect trace amounts of salt in cooked products and small amounts of sugar drive my mouth crazy).  I will admit that it is more subtle than regular ice cream, but I kind of expected it since there are no egg yolks/fats to intensify the flavor.<br /><br />Arctic Zero is a good brand to try if you're satisfied with mediocre ice cream and want to pay a hefty price.  However, I do admit that it is a good alternative if you're watching calories.

review/text: Really this stuff isn't bad at all.  I picked it up because I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed tomorrow, and knew I would be wanting something frozen to soothe my mouth.  However, I've been trying to loose a few pounds as well. This seemed like the perfect thing.  I was a little put off after reading the reviews on here, so I decided to take it for a test run before the big day.  And I have to say I thought this was actually pretty good! Having said that, keep in mind I am someone who is used to low calorie (sugar free, fat free, low carb, gluten free, etc) desserts. It doesn't compare to Ben & Jerry's, but of course, I wasn't expecting it to.  I fully intend on vegging out with this after my surgery tomorrow.  If necessary, I might even go back to the store and pick up another flavor!

review/summary: Pretty good
review/text: I have only tried the chocolate peanut butter flavor, and while it certainly was not as decadent and creamy as a real ice cream by any means...  I did like it, and for 150 calories a pint, it is a great way to satisfy a craving.  I would liken the flavor of this one to sugar free fudgesicles.  I could not taste any peanut butter in it, which was a bit disappointing. I would certainly buy it again, but I also really like fudgesicles.  The fact that it is lactose friendly and gluten free is a big plus as well.

review/text: First off I do not work for Arctic Zero.  I am using my real name here so you can google me.  Anyway I felt compelled to write a little bit about this for anyone out there who, like me, has an "it's-the-end-of-the-day-and-I-need-a-treat" addiction but needs to cut calories for whatever reason.<br />For those of you who love plain vanilla ice cream and never put any toppings on your ice cream and would not DREAM of wasting good ice cream in a shake or smoothy; why on earth are you even looking into reading this?  There will never be a replacement for a good pint of Haagen Daaz vanilla.  Just as you would not try to serve a good fillet minion made out of soy meat, you should not be looking to replace high quality ice cream with something that, well, is not ice cream!<br />However I give this four stars because it works great for using as a night time treat.  I love combining flavours so for me, the base is not as important as what goes into it.  I mix this with nice berry preserves, or fresh fruit, or a nice chocolate cookie or nuts and it still comes in at 1/4 the calories.  So, if like me, you just need something sweet in the night and are not that picky, this is completely and totally perfect.<br />I give it 4 stars instead of 5 only because I think the price is a little outrageous.

review/summary: overrated
review/text: I saw this ice cream on the Today Show this morning.  It was featured as an item to satisfy sweet cravings without adding extra calories.  I purchased the chocolate peanut butter one and it tastes like a protein shake.  I think you are better off getting a lower calorie frozen treat such as Lifeway's Frozen Kefir.  It is 360 calories for the whole pint, but who needs to eat the whole pint anyway?  It also has probiotics in it.  Less calories in this case is less flavor.
