review/text: I had tried this product at a friends for a lunch salad. It was so delicious I couldn't wait to get home and see if I could find it on line. I really appreciated the no shipping charge. It arrived last night and it was just as good as I remember, so happy I found it. I will buy it again. Try it for a change.

review/text: I used this oil as the fat for homemade pie crust, as well as adding 2-4 tablespoons to pumpkin pie batter for additional richness, and a deeper pumpkin flavor!  Its awesome, and adds a unique color to the crust.

review/summary: Enjoyable
review/text: I only learned about toasted pumpkin seed oil recently, but it has already become a favorite food. I have tried other brands, but this is the best so far. It has a complex aroma of toasted nuts, and goes as well with oatmeal or vanilla ice cream as with a salad. A word of caution: this oil is fragile, and needs to be stored in the refrigerator after opening to preserve its flavors and aromas.

review/summary: A very tasty oil
review/text: This arrived yesterday and so far I've only tried it once, which made a great dressing for watercress and cabbage.  When you bite into the dressed salad, there is a brief moment when you can taste the pumpkin flavor.<br /><br />The bottles are very tiny, and the plastic seal which you pull to open seems secure.  There was no leakage.<br /><br />The oil is a very dark greenish/reddish color.  I know it sounds like an implausible combination of colors, but that's what it looked like to me.<br /><br />Looking forward to trying the suggestion of drizzling it on ice cream.  Look forward to using this oil with other foods and in other ways.<br /><br />It's nice we can order these from amazon as the local Whole Foods only has the walnut oil and pecan oil from this brand, but does not carry the pumpkin seed oil.<br /><br />I might try this brand's walnut oil next, as it is significantly cheaper than the pumpkin seed oil.

review/summary: Since When Are Strips of Brick Jerky?
review/text: Like a lot of people, I guess, I got scared of chicken jerky made in China. Even though I used a very respectable brand that's sold broadly in every major chain (Dogswell), I still felt a little queasy. So I bought this stuff, which is made in Colorado. Colorado! What better state for dogs than Colorado? Great terrain changes, fresh air, active residents--boy, was this jerky gonna be great. Only it wasn't. It was rock-hard. My Havanese are 15 and 18 pounds, so there's no way they're getting a whole strip; i break off pieces. I cannot do so with this product, except to break a strip in half. The only reason this product didn't get one star is that my dogs seem to like whatever bite-sized pieces I'm able to create by using a hammer.

review/summary: Taste of Campbell's Chunky Chicken Noodle Soup
review/text: Price is too high compared to the 18.6 oz cans.  At 18.6 oz can price a case of 12 of the smaller 10.75 oz cans should only cost $12.11 if the 18.6 oz cost $20.96 for a case of 12.  That is .02 cents per ounce more, buying it by the smaller cans.<br />I purchased a few cases of the smaller cans when they were on sale, then seen the 18.6 oz cans were cheaper by the ounce and bought four cases of them to try.<br /><br />WOW, was I SURPRISED. I have gone back to eating the smaller cans of the soup. The flavor in the bigger cans does NOT even come close to tasting the same as the soup in the smaller cans.  Why that is I have no idea. But I find the flavor of the smaller cans MUCH more flavorful and tasty vs the larger cans.  If the larger cans contained soup that tasted the same, I would purchase the larger cans every time.  But all 48 cans in the four cases tasted the same.  Something just not quite right with the flavor.<br /><br />Personal preference I am sure, but that is part of life.  I grabbed the salt and pepper mills and added a little of each to the big cans of soup.  Nope, I couldn't make it taste as good as the soup in the smaller cans, no matter how I dressed it up.  The smaller cans needed no salt or pepper, and the flavor was/is perfect, thus I bought seven cases of the smaller cans in the past three months.<br /><br />I would give it five stars, but doc it one star because of the high price.  And, yes, sometimes some of the cans are dented, but I think most of these cans, which they sell for about half of what you pay in a grocery store for them, are distressed goods. e.g. Picked up from grocery stores because they ARE dented.  A dent doesn't bother me since I am only paying about half price per can and getting it delivered for free.  Campbell's large cans of rib roast are great flavor, but that is another story/review.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V6FTZO">Campbells Chunky Soup, Classic Chicken Noodle, 10.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Best "canned" chicken noodle soup I've tasted
review/text: For "canned" soup, this actually tastes pretty good and I am VERY particular. So for me to say that, it's saying a lot. If I had to rate this out of all the canned soups I've eaten in my life, 10 being best, I'd give this a 7.<br /><br />I add hot sauce and salt to mine, plus I eat it with Lay's Spicy Cayenne & Cheese chips. It gives the meal a crunch to it, which makes me feel like I'm really eating. Otherwise, it's just mush.<br /><br />I actually LIKE the smaller size because I can't finish the larger cans. It's perfect for how much I want to eat. Most portions are too big and too much food for one sitting.

review/summary: An excellent soup with a bad rep
review/text: It was a bit of a surprise to see how poor the reviews of this soup are. In terms of taste and texture, this chicken noodle soup is very close to the 18-ounce Healthy Choice Chunky chicken soup that Amazon also sells. And that gets five-star ratings from reviewers.<br /><br />This soup has a fairly rich and tangy chicken broth. The noodles are substantial and just about as good as canned noodles can possibly be. There are chunks of white chicken meat in the soup. There is also a hint of other vegetables (carrots, I think) in the broth. The Healthy Choice version of this soup is actually a bit more bland than this soup because the use of salt is minimized. The 10-ounce size of the can makes this an ideal choice for a quick snack, whereas the 18-ounce Chunky soups are a bit too large as a snack for one person.<br /><br />So what's not to like? The negative reviews seem to focus on three things: the soup is watery, the cans are too small, and the price is too high. Let me take these in turn:<br /><br />1. The Chunky soup line is not condensed soup. I know from other reviews that some people think it is, add water, and then complain that the soup tastes watery. This soup actually has an appropriate amount of broth as it is. That broth is fragrant and has a distinctive chicken-y taste. If you add water, though, it will taste watery.<br /><br />2. The cans are exactly as big as Amazon claims. I know some people buy this expecting the big Chunky soup cans sold in supermarkets, and these people understandably feel disappointed. I had to learn myself to be careful and check the quantity or volume with any online grocery purchases.  But as I said above, the 20-ounce cans are ideal for quick snacks. I knew I was buying something in smaller cans, and I personally found this size preferable.<br /><br />3. The soup right now is in fact overpriced at $22. The Healthy Choice 12-pack of 18-ounce chicken noodle soup costs less, around the $18-19 range. That's a much better deal. When I got this particular item from Amazon, I paid about $13. The soup is a good deal at that price. Any higher, and it's a poor deal.<br /><br />By the way, I add Parmesan cheese and baco-bits to this soup. It makes for a more entertaining treat. I hope some of this proves helpful.

review/text: This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.  Here's my brief breakdown:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - The sweetest of the 3 for sure.  It is also probably the thickest but still runny.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  When I put this in my lemonade for the Master Cleanse, it makes the lemonade sweeter than how I like it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ENHSC8">NOW Foods Maple Syrup Grade B Organic, 32 ounce</a> - Is less sweet when compared to Coombs but a little sweeter than Family Heritage.  Runnier than Coombs but these syrups are all a little runnier than grocery syrups.  200 calories per serving of 4 tbsp.  It provided the right amount of sweetness for the Master Cleanse specifications for a drink.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00248E980">Family Heritage Organic Vermont Maple Syrup, Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> - Good quality and tastes sweet but definitely not as sweet as the other 2.  Didn't get the calorie info before throwing the bottle away but I'm figuring it's the same as the other 2.  I usually put an extra 1/2 a tbsp in my master cleanse lemonade to get it a little sweeter and curb the hunger.

review/summary: Adds a dash of magic to breakfast
review/text: This is really good maple syrup, packed with flavor, dense, and dark. Naturally it takes homemade waffles and pancakes to the next level, but it can also add a dash of magic to other breakfast staples, such as oatmeal or muffins. It is hard to imagine how commercial syrups laden with artificial flavors, colors, and other content can even be marketed as syrup---this is the real deal.

review/summary: So much better than Grade A!
review/text: I'm from Maine and I have to tell you that I would never buy grade A maple syrup. If I'm going to use maple syrup, I want that rich, distinctive taste, not something that's barely different than white sugar. That's actually a good comparison - grade A is to grade B as white is to brown sugar. I know we're all used to thinking of "grade A" as meaning of superior quality, but that's not how it works with this. It is referring to the level of filtering/processing the sap goes through. If you want generic sweetness, go grade A. For everything else, grade B. This is a trusted brand of organic syrup with a great flavor. By the way, for baking and real maple syrup afficionados, there is also a grade C (even darker)!

review/text: If you are thinking of doing the Master Cleanse, this is the product you are looking for.  It is reasonably priced, high quality and exactly fits all the specifications they recommend.  One note, if you are going to do the full 10 days you will either need 2 or an additional 32 oz. I personally liked it as a table syrup as well.  It's the "stout" of maple syrups.

review/text: I started using this product for the Master Cleanse (lemonade diet). I have tried other brands but found this one to be the best.  I highley recommend it.  The only problem I have found is in the shipping sometimes the plastic cap gets broken even though they pack it well the delivery people most likely have dropped it at some point.  Thats the way it goes sometimes.  Since the jug is sealed it's still usable.

My husband has been wanting pancakes just so he can eat the syrup! I've used it for a Master Cleanse and don't know if it's the quality of the syrup or what, but have had better success with detoxing using this than a Grade A or other brand of Grade B (this is my 3rd MC).  I look forward to using this for breakfast and baking, I will reorder again and recommend to friends and family! It would make a great gift in a gourmet gift basket!

review/text: I have used real maple syrup for years.  When my kids were small I used the standard stuff until I started becoming a label reader, then I could not in good conscience continue to serve a product that amounted to a liquid chemical concoction.  I recently discovered grade B syrup, which has a stronger, more molassas kind of flavor.  Besides the obvious pancakes and french toast, I also use it on oatmeal and in baked goods.  Will continue to purchase.

review/summary: Definition of NON-GE for this product, from Now Foods. I have not used this item, am just giving definition.
review/text: Non-GE - "GE" stands for genetic engineering and is also referred to as GMO (genetically modified organism). Genetic engineering of food products uses gene splicing to overcome natural boundaries that would otherwise prohibit the creation of a product. Genes from different species can be combined to create a hardier product resistant to certain exogenous factors. As an example, you might be able to add fish genes to corn to make it resistant to pesticides. Although there may be "instant gratification" from such benefits as better taste, longer shelf life, and greater yield, serious concerns exist about the long-term ramifications of using these types of products and ingredients. Until more research backing the safety of GE products is available, we'll continue to make every effort to use only non-GE ingredients and products

review/summary: Product is good, but bottle arrived damaged.
review/text: It's grade-B maple syrup. I used it for some Christmas recipes. It was sticky and smelled and tasted of maple, and was (presumably) not made out of some unknown substance that fell to earth, possibly from space. I trust that a health-food company would sell the genuine article so advertised. Perhaps naive of me, but I was willing to take that leap of faith this time.<br /><br />Only gripe: the blue cap arrived broken. There was a silvery plastic seal across the top, much like you would find on a bottle of salad dressing, so the syrup stayed in place. I would not, however, recommend using the syrup as salad dressing. Unless you're into that kind of thing. Not that there's anything wrong with that. You freak.

review/summary: Healthy Ingredient in Baked Goods Recipes
review/text: I recently discovered ordering Bob's Red Mill products through Amazon for baking ingredients that may be difficult to find in local stores.  I grind the whole flaxseeds to a meal using a coffee grinder and primarily use the flaxseed meal to replace all or some of the butter and oil in baked goods recipes.  Sounds sketchy but it really does work - in my experience, even in yeast bread recipes!  It has a very subtle, almost undetectable flavor and you'll see little flecks of the meal in your baked product, particularly if all white flour is used.  Store ground flaxseed in fridge or freezer.  Flaxseed meal has multiple health benefits including Omega-3's, lignans, fiber.  Here's how to add the meal to your baked goods (copied from Livestrong.com):<br /><br />-Add flaxseed meal to breads, muffins, pastries, cookies and other baked goods for extra nutrition and to produce a nutty flavor. According to the Barleans website, flaxseed meal should compose a minimum of 6 to 8 percent of the dry ingredients in any recipe.<br /><br />-Replace the oil, shortening, butter or margarine with flaxseed meal in any baked goods recipe at a ratio of 3:1. If a recipe calls for 1/3 cup of oil, for example, replace with 1 cup flaxseed meal. Flaxseed meal has a high oil content, but contains less fat than most oils, shortening, butter and margarine.<br /><br />-Reduce the flour in any baked goods recipe by 25 percent and replace with flaxseed meal. If a recipe requires 1 cup flour, for example, use 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal instead. Using flaxseed meal this way adds a slight nutty flavor and a golden brown color to your baked goods.<br /><br />-Use flaxseed meal as replacement for eggs in baked goods. Combine 1 tbsp. flaxseed meal with 3 tbsp. water for each egg and let the mixture stand for about five minutes before using in batters and doughs.<br /><br />Read more:[...]

review/text: I bought this product because of the 5 star reviews for it.  I did see a one star review that said it was overly spicy, but since I like spicy things I thought I'd try them.  It is a decent ginger product, but is less than restaurant quality (unless you go to a restaurant that serves this bottle!).  It is more spicy than the other ginger I have tried at restaurants, but that did not bother me.  The issue I have with this product is that the after taste is not fresh.  When I first bit into the ginger I thought it was going to be great because initially it tastes just like I remember restaurant quality ginger.  The aftertaste is the disappointment.

review/summary: Good enough
review/text: First, let me say that this ginger is from China, and any food from China concerns me.<br /><br />I have eaten about 30 bottles of this ginger.  It is different from the pickled ginger (gari) that you will get in most restaurants.  It seems to have been pickled for a shorter time, and it is definitely crunchier than restaurant ginger.  Also, it is hotter and less sweet, and the slices are thicker.  Nonetheless, when I eat it with sushi, I like the hotter taste because it is more flavorful (ginger is naturally hot).  When I first tried bottled gari 20 years ago, it was absolutely horrible, so I know how much worse this ginger could be.  A lot of people don't know that gari is not supposed to be eaten with sushi; it is supposed to be eaten between courses of a meal to cleanse the palate.  But I prefer to eat my ginger with sushi, and the more intense flavor suits me.  However, if I were eating it between courses, I would want a milder, sweeter ginger.<br /><br />The first bottles of Roland ginger that I ate were from a discount store, and they were a little old.  They had a slight off-flavor.  By the time I ate the last bottle (a year after I got them), the inner plastic seal disintegrated as I removed it, so you can't let this ginger sit around indefinitely.  Indeed, I think that the vinegar probably caused the plastic seal to degrade faster than it would have.  The fresher bottles that I got from Amazon have a fresher flavor, and it is definitely good enough to eat with sushi.  Unless you are prepared to make your own gari, I recommend it (although I haven't tried any other brands).<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about the thicker slices.  Restaurant ginger is sliced very thin and is limp, this ginger is sliced thicker and is firm and crunchy.  The thicker slices may be one of the reasons it is hotter, since the vinegar may not penetrate the thicker slices as well.  I had no objection to the thicker slices until I opened a bottle and found slices up to 2mm thick -- that's definitely too thick.  But for the most part, I don't mind the thicker, stiffer, crunchier, hotter qualities of this ginger.  This ginger is a little closer to being raw than restaurant ginger is, but it's good enough to eat with sushi.<br /><br />The vinegar leaked out of one of the bottles during my second shipment from Amazon, and the vinegar soaked the cardboard box.  I didn't have rice vinegar, so I replaced the vinegar with water, and the ginger tasted okay.  When I got my third shipment (on Oct. 21st), I found that the bottles were sealed in a plastic bag.  None of them leaked; but if they had, the plastic bag should have caught the liquid.  I have now received 40 bottles from Amazon, and only one leaked.

review/summary: Inferior Product. Not nearly restaurant grade  pickled ginger
review/text: When most reviews are so  good, I tend to be suspect of the  rare poor one. Unfortunately, after trusting the good reviews (and figuring the negative one was an outlyer of sorts), I purchased this ginger.  Extremely disappointed!  It is very thick - which to me is not a problem. But, it is unusually hot...I've never had HOT ginger before (spicy -yes,fire HOT- no).  Moreover, the balance of the spices/ingredients is just weird, leading to a very nasty bitter... almost chemical, lingering aftertaste, which I'm attributing to possibly (??) the type of or an overuse of preservative, since the nasty aftertaste isn't consistent with any of the common ingredients. If you must, try it for yourself (as did I), but be forewarned. Hopefully, I'll be able to send it back and get my return shipping reimbursed. This is NOTHING like the wonderful ginger served in a restaurant with sushi.

review/text: This Roland Sushi Ginger is my husband's favorite by far. I also think it tastes the best. It has just the right balance of ginger flavor and sweet and sour. We have tried two other brands and have found them wanting. One was waaay too salty. The other just didn't have enough of a ginger taste. We are patiently waiting for Amazon to return this brand to stock. I hope we don't have to wait too much longer. PLEASE, PLEASE bring it back.

In fact, I went ahead and emptied out all eight jars into one large, glass Mason jar. We go through ginger pretty quickly, so I'm not worried about it spoiling.

review/summary: not sushi quality
review/text: For those who like ginger, this product is fine on its own merits. However, for sushi, the product is not appropriate. For one thing, the slices are really thick and large which completely overwhelms the sushi flavour. Ginger is a supposed to be a complement to the sushi meal. The ginger should be thinly sliced, almost translucent. This is something else which is fine for other meals. For instance, I dice the slices for my other dishes.

review/text: Received this ginger in the mail and at least two of the bottles were leaking.  The 'liner' used beneath the lids does not appear to be sealed well at all, on any of the bottles.  We were actually a little nervous about even eating any of the bottles.  After going through and tossing several, we decided to keep the remainder and re-package them in canning jars to help preserve them.  The ginger is sliced fairly thick and we have to cut it down to make it managable for eating on our sushi.  All in all, the flavor is decent, but a lot of tedious work to get to that point.  In the future, we will either can our own or try and find a local carrier to buy our sushi ginger.

review/summary: Disappointed Expectations
review/text: The seller states in the product description that the quantity of Kefir grains will be enough to make one cup of milk. The amount I received was just over a teaspoon and the seller's directions which came with it said to put it in a quarter of a cup of milk. The grains seemed rather delicate and I've been "babying" them for about a week now and still haven't been able to make a cup of Kefir. Their fragile state was probably in part due to the way they were shipped. They were put without any liquid in a tiny, sealed, thin plastic envelope which was placed in an un-padded, business sized letter envelope. The $5.49 shipping seems rather steep for two stamps and a remarkable lack of special packaging. If I had it to do over again I would probably order from somewhere else. That being said, I have been able to make Kefir--albeit in doll portions---and the flavor is good.

review/summary: Kefir grains from Drybyma Treasures
review/text: I bought grains from the Amazon seller "Drybyma Treasures" about a month and a half ago. I received them in 3 days, and they took about 3 days to recover from their ordeal in the mail, producing some very nasty sour-milk-tasting stuff the first day and some very yeasty-tasting stuff the second two days. But their fourth attempt was delicious and by now they've fully recovered and are reproducing like mad. Drybyma sent about 2 tablespoons of grains in the original package, but in a couple of weeks I had half a cup and a week after that I had almost a full cup of grains. I've had to give some grains away and eat some in order to keep the population down.<br /><br />The grains looked like cottage cheese curds when they first arrived. But then they started producing noodle-like shapes and recently began producing tiny cauliflower shapes. It's interesting how they develop.<br /><br />The kefir they produce tastes similar to the kefir I used to buy at my neighborhood Whole Foods store. Sometimes it's more tart than other times, and thickness also varies. I've used both Jersey milk and goat's milk. The thickest, mildest kefir I've made was with raw light cream.<br /><br />Unfortunately Drybyma doesn't seem to be selling kefir grains at the moment. Perhaps they sold out and need to rebuild their stock. Hopefully they'll return so other shoppers can enjoy their product. I can't really rate any other seller's kefir grains because quality can vary.

review/summary: Didn't work for me.
review/text: I used organic whole milk** to try to grow the grains from the scant teaspoon I received from the seller. The milk didn't develop a sourish smell, so I guess it stayed fresh, even after 30 days, but I had few and very small--size of uncooked rice--grains. I will stay with the packaged Kefir Starter that I've used for years and which I purchase from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Though I received a couple of pages of instructions from the seller, whose product is shown here at Amazon, those instructions didn't really help me, a novice at growing my own grains. I haven't bothered to contact the seller for help and/or more grains, because it seems a waste of time. I would guess from reading his enclosed instructions that while he tried to be helpful he doesn't really know how to instruct a novice in using the small amount of grains he sent.<br /><br />I am guessing that the pics showing huge grains on websites could just be marketing examples wherein the grower has been using raw milk or something like it. That's just a guess on my part, and if that is the case, it is an example of good marketing, but the sites need to give more-helpful information to the novice.<br /><br />**Perhaps that was my problem? At any rate, I love, love, love kefir as do my kittykats.

review/text: The grains arrived in less than one week from date of order.  There were a few yellowish curds with a milky coating in a plastic baggy, inside a small brown envelope.  I placed them in milk and a day later the milk had curdled.  I strained and got a very watery whey that I drank.  It had a curious taste, not unpleasant, but not yogurt-like, as I had expected.  I put all the curds back in the jar and covered them with a cup of milk.  The next day the whey was more white, but very watery.  It took about ten days of this routine before I was getting a good creamy kefir through the strainer and a good separtion of the grains for re-culturation.  I'm seeing an increase in the number of grains each week, but not overwhelming.  I think my strainer allows some of the very small ones through.  It's an interesting process and I love the results.  My wife's heartburn has disappeared in the past month and I attribute it to the kefir.

review/summary: great probiotic, tangy cheese
review/text: The kefir granules arrived in excellent condition.  I followed the instructions but found that my granules "worked" very fast and required a quart of milk very soon after I got them.  The first 2 weeks the kefir was very watery, as the granules were "settling in."  I had to leave for a short trip, so I put a batch in the fridge for 2-3 days.  Ever since then the kefir (I make 4-day-old kefir cheese rather than 1-day-old kefir) has been beautiful and creamy and very tangy.  I'm getting used to the flavor, introducing it to lots of friends, and enjoy making it!  It's so easy.  I love that you just throw it in a clean jar with milk and put it in the cupboard for 1-4 days.  No cooking.  The straining is easy and the whey is super sour.  I use it in smoothies and use it to ferment/pickle veggies.  Best of all, the kefir cheese is high in vitamins as well as being a fantastic probiotic.  I don't think I'll ever stop drinking/eating it.  I do a lot of traveling, but I can easily take it with me in a 3 oz. or smaller glass bottle that I keep in my hand-checked bag when I go on trips.  I use fresh (or powdered if fresh is unavailable) goat milk and it's really good and healthy.

review/text: I have been following directions for about a month with the kefir I received--which by the way was a very miniscule amount, looked to be a little less than a teaspoon!  It does something--resulting in curds resembling cottage cheese, but so far I see nothing like translucent "kefir grains" developing. I have an excellent source of fresh raw cows milk and I've tried 24 and 48 hour culturing.  I've tried draining it using a plastic can colander and straining it in a regular plastic colander.  Maybe kefirs vary from source to source.  I am still new at this.  So far I just mix part of the curds into already made yogurt and put the rest back into the jar to make more of this stuff. I did appreciate the referral to Dom's site

review/summary: Best homemade kefir yet!
review/text: I made the mistake of putting too much milk in the jar the first time I made kefir with these grains (old habit) but thought, what the heck, it won't hurt the grains. In 24 hours I strained the milk out of the grains and added just less than a pint (about 12 ounces) of milk to them the second time (I drank the slightly soured milk from the first batch--not bad) Within 24 hours that short pint had turned into the thickest, smoothest, yummiest kefir ever! I've made 2 more batches since and the last one was with 3 cups of milk. Absolutely perfect. I'm convinced that my next batch will do a full quart. Highly recommend this product.<br /><br />PS: I use a low heat pasteurized milk. I would not recommend using regular pasteurized milk and absolutely DO NOT use ultra-pasteurized milk. Raw milk will work but only for the first and maybe second batch as the wild bacteria in the raw milk compete with the kefir grains. If you use raw milk then always let your kefir grains renew themselves in some pasteurized milk.

If you aren't used to the taste you can try mixing it with fruit juice.<br /><br />If you end up with too many grains, and can't give them away, you can eat the extras. They're good with honey. (If you're not used to eating kefir grains you should start with a small amount.)<br /><br />If you have any problems, the seller is very nice and extremely helpful. Probably the nicest person I've dealt with on Amazon.

review/summary: Kefir is starting to do well
review/text: I purchased these grains a few weeks back. There weren't very many in the small plastic envelope and I wasn't sure how this would turn out. Well, They are finally multiplying and I was able to get a first decent batch yesterday. They still have a long ways to go to produce a pint or two a day but at least they were alive and are doing well. I expected more for the money, but in the end, I got what I wanted.

review/summary: Live kefir grains
review/text: When the grains arrived, they we're in the form of a liquid. I was concerned that they looked nothing like actual grains. The seller sent along instructions which addressed this. Having been my first experience with grains, I didn't know what to expect. Her instructions, which also contained a source where I could learn more, we're invaluable. The seller was communicative and helpful; standing behind her product if I wasn't satisfied. My grains continue to grow and I am delighted by the service and product. Thank you.

review/summary: milk keifer
review/text: I was so impressed with how quickly the grains grew and really love having the healthy milk drink.  We milk so the grains go into fresh milk right from the cow.  I am using keifer cheese too.

review/text: These arrived as described. I got them into milk as soon as I could and they have responded very nicely. After about 3 days, as I have replaced the milk about every 12 hours, they've grown and seem to be doing very well.

review/summary: i am so pleased
review/text: I recieved the grains within a couple of days of placing my order. They arrived in great condition. I followed the directions included in the package and was amazed at how quickly they multiplied. It has been a little over 2 weeks and I have more grains than I need (that's a good thing). The product was everything I'd hoped for. Thank you.
