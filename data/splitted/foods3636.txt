review/summary: Dark Chocolate Dream Pure Dark
review/text: I think that its wonderful that this is 100% dairy free, but I would rather just stick with dark chocolate then this bar.  It is rather smooth which is nice, but it has such a fake flavor of chocolate that is not pleasant to my taste buds. I am a big fan of dark chocolate for the fact that it is not overly sweet, but this chocolate bar is so sweet it almost just tastes like sugar and no chocolate flavor at all. Some people really love this stuff, so the only way you will know for sure is to try it yourself and you be the judge.  Before purchasing off of amazon, I would go to your local health food store and buy one to try.  You will save money and you will know for sure if you like this chocolate or not.

review/text: Bush's Best Grillin' Baked Beans Steakhouse Recipe are some SERIOUSLY great beans. The recipe has a rich, delicious flavor, and the texture is everything you've come to expect from Busch. This is a great side-dish along with any meat, but I also tried browning lean ground beef or turkey and tossing it all into the beans for a main course that everyone loved. Served along with corn on the cob, a green veg or salad, and some garlic bread -- it was perfection!<br /><br />As long as you have a can of these beans in the house, you've got a good meal to whip up in minutes. (And, it's a heck of a lot cheaper than eating out -- even in a fast food joint!)

review/summary: My favorite flavor
review/text: Perfect size for work.  Just fill with water, stick it in the microwave for 1 minute, and enjoy.  Has bits of apples in it, which makes it yummy.  The maple flavor is my 2nd favorite, but a bit to sweet for my taste.  The cinammon roll flavor is bringing up the rear.  This is probably about the size of 2 regular instant oatmeal packets.  Fills me up and it's good.  Order a case and you'll be set for a couple of months!

review/summary: Baked apple offers more fiber, less sugar
review/text: Through the work week, breakfast is perfunctory with oatmeal just another option among cereal bars and yogurt. We've stocked various brands of instant oatmeal but Quaker Oatmeal Express best balances our desires for tasty and healthy. Our sons - ages 6 and 4 - enjoy the different flavors. My wife likes the individual cups, which make clean-up a breeze.<br /><br />Quaker Oatmeal Express is office-friendly, too. You can prepare the oatmeal with hot water or a microwave. Either way, you've got a no-mess breakfast in less than two minutes. Again, the individual cups are great for a portable option much healthier than anything you'll find on a fast food drive-thru menu.<br /><br />We've purchased three Quaker Oatmeal Express flavors, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPO6LU">Cinnamon Roll</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HIFB8Q">Golden Brown Sugar</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HIHEL8">Baked Apple</a>. All three are not overly sweet. The Baked Apple flavor has a slight fiber edge (1 g) over the other flavors.<br /><br />In summary, skip the sausage egg biscuit and pick up this healthier breakfast option instead. (Studies have found that oatmeal is more filling than dry cereal with the same calories and fiber content.) Quaker Oatmeal Express is healthy, portable and makes clean-up easy.<br /><br />One caveat: if time is not a consideration, the best oatmeal you can buy on Amazon is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5U3I">McCANN'S Steel Cut Oatmeal</a>. We purchase it through Amazon's Subscribe & Save program. This is our Sunday-morning-family-breakfast oatmeal. We add frozen berries, or a tablespoon of brown sugar and an ounce of Drambuie to the cooking pot. The texture and nutty flavor of McCann's oatmeal sets it apart from anything else we've experienced.

review/summary: Quaker Instant Oatmeal, express baked apple
review/text: Was delighted I could order this item...not available anywhere in the State of Georgia. It<br />tastes great and I really enjoy the apples in it.<br /><br />Though I was disappointed in the date it is to expire.  When I purchase something via mail<br />I expect a better expiration date on it.  Not 6 months.  I am buying bulk.  It will take<br />a bit longer to use than normal and I don't want to have to throw any away because of the<br />date.  That defeats the bulk buying!<br /><br />5 star for the product 3 star for the company purchased from.

review/summary: Great Oatmeal!
review/text: I found this oatmeal a few years ago - and fell in love!! It's easy and convenient -- throw it in the microwave as you are getting ready to go, grab a plastic spoon , and you have breakfast on the go! I love the taste of it and have a few tricks that I use. First, I fill it to below the "fill to" line. Then when it's cooked, I sprinkle some Cinnamon or my favorite, Cinnamon sugar into it and mix. Let it sit for a few minutes, usually 3 or so - and it becomes thicker and feels more filling. I am a very picky girl and tend to eat the same things over and over. There are times that I will eat one for breakfast and then again at lunch. At 200 calories , I think that is a reasonable choice.<br />I think the Baked Apple is by far the best, but be sure and try them all.

review/summary: ease of use makes you use it more!!
review/text: Yeah, OK, I know, these cups are wasteful.  And you can buy this and many other cereals in single-serving envelopes that you then cook in your own utensils.<br /><br />So why go with these?<br /><br />Because they're so incredibly easy.  And because something that's easy gets done more often than something that's not.<br /><br />I used to buy these with delight in my local grocery store -- always had them on hand.  More mornings than not, I'd have one of these, either before leaving for work or once I got there.  It would always hold me until lunch or later, without any impulse to snack in the morning.  Maybe a couple of times a week, I'd have another one for a snack in the afternoon or evening, just because it was so easy -- almost as easy as the pint of ice cream I'd have rather had but which would have been much less good for me (and even easier than EasyMac!).<br /><br />Then I couldn't find them at any local grocery store for years.  So I'd occasionally buy a new box of the instant envelopes, having thrown out the old box before ever finishing it.  There they sat, unwanted and forlorn, until they too got tossed.<br /><br />These aren't the best diet food or health food, and they certainly aren't ecologically wise.  But they work.  They're easy enough that they'll substitute for even less good choices (such as a take-out breakfast sandwich -- erghhhh).  And they're satisfying -- you really feel you've had something when you finish scraping out the last of the bowl just as it is (no need to add anything).<br /><br />I even looked for them occasionally on Amazon but could never find them.  Imagine my surprise when I googled them tonight in a sudden mad urge to go farther if necessary to stock up on them again, only to discover Amazon has them after all!  And on Subscribe-and-Save, no less!  Awesome.<br /><br />My case is on its way.  If you decide to try one, I think you'll be as happy as I am.  We're all in luck!!!  :)

When we got it, my initial thought was that it would go stale by the time we got through the huge 10 oz jar, but it keep pretty fresh almost all the way to the end. We did replace it before it was totally used up, I guess we might have gotten another batch or two of bread from it, but at the price, even tossing that little bit away, it was a bargain.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I've had insomnia off and on for the past year +. I've been prescribed just about everything...including the main stuff like ambien. Ambien, unlike what the commercials promote, left me with horrible hangovers, terrible mood swings...and often times I would sleep walk/do things that I didn't even remember. I've also tried in store stuff like tylenol PM or sleep aids you can find in your local drugstore...really, nothing worked. Finally I discovered Dream Water from a random amazon search and found some at Duane Reade. It works (no pun intended) like a dream. I sleep well with little to no hangover at all...no mood swings...and it doesn't knock you out. It slowly relaxes you into a sleep, as it promotes. After all this time...a more natural remedy, and one that's not cheap necessarily, but definitely cheaper. 5 stars, no doubt about it.

review/summary: Works for me - at half dose.
review/text: I am a nurse that works night shift and travels frequently. Between the two, I have a funky sleep schedule and sometimes go through periods of extreme insomnia.<br /><br />Then, at the airport in Long Beach, CA I found Dream Water. I was a little shocked at the price but decided to try it anyway. Because it was expensive, I tried half a shot and it worked, well, like a dream. A whole shot makes me do weird things in my sleep, but a half shot makes me fall asleep and get a good 6-8 hours with no hangover effect - even during my severe episodes of insomnia.<br /><br />As a nurse, I would like to recommend that you be careful taking it every day. One of the ingredients (5-HTP) can cause serotonin syndrome in certain doses. Since we don't know the exact dose they use, I would look up serotonin syndrome and be on the look out for side effects if you take it regularly. Just in case. I haven't had any side effects, but better safe than sorry.<br /><br />Also, be careful mixing it with certain other meds used to adjust mood (anxiety/depression meds) or other sleep aids - even natural ones. Just a heads up.

review/summary: My Hero!!!!
review/text: This is the best stuff on earth!! I don't like medicine- I haven't even taken a Tylenol in years- so it was very hard for me to find a solution for my sleeping problems. Teas are natural, but don't work are all, and pills have nasty side effects. Dream Water is natural and effective!!! I also love that I don't have to count calories, because I do take this regularly.<br />It is powerful enough to help you fall asleep, but mild enough that you can wake up whenever you want to, without leaving you groggy or out of it. Both flavors are great!<br />By it for yourself- and if you want to make other busy/stressed out people very happy (your friends, your parents, your teachers, your coworkers, etc), spread it around!!

review/text: I've had sleeping problems for years now and nothings really worked.  I refuse to try Ambien or any prescription drugs for fear of side effects.  I use to use Tylenol PM but I found myself feeling a hangover effect in the morning.  I was recommended "Dream Water" by a pharmacist in a Duane Read by my job a few months ago and I've been using it ever since.  It both relaxes me and helps me fall asleep on the nights I am laying awake counting sheep.  It tastes great unlike some of the other products I've tried, I prefer the Snoozeberry flavor myself, but the Lullaby Lemon is just as good.  Finally something that works for me!!!

review/summary: Sweet Dreams!
review/text: I came across this product in a local store by accident and decided to give it a try.  I must say I was more impressed than I thought I would be.  And honestly I didn't think it would work at all.<br /><br />Normally, I lay in bed for a while watching TV until I fall asleep. It sometimes takes me about an hour or better to actually fall asleep even though most mornings I awake at 5am. I wake up several times in the night, for no reason, but generally go back to sleep with no problems. I tend to wake up a little sluggish and not wanting to get out bed. Well I drank the Dream Water, the taste is pleasant, and in about 30 minutes I felt more relaxed.  But I think I was fighting it at first. But as soon as I laid down, I was sleep in time.  I slept through the night.  And woke up refreshed and felt rested and ready to start my day.<br /><br />Of course this shouldn't be used daily but for those days when I think sleep is going to be hard to come by, I keep some Dream Water on hand. Some of the ingredients (this products claims to be all natural) are maybe not for people with high blood pressure. So please pay attention to the label.  But if you have no existing health issues I'd recommend giving it a shot!

review/summary: It even helped ME!
review/text: I suffer from idiopathic insomnia, which is basically lifelong insomnia, every night, with no known cause. I've tried EVERY sleep drug - ambien, trazodone, lunesta, etc. etc. You name it! I HATE taking drugs, especially to sleep. So I'm always looking for a natural alternative. I've tried "sleep shots" in the past, but my body is very sensitive and most of them have tons of different herbs that can cause negative reactions. THIS DOESN'T! This contains only ingredients that are SUPPOSED to be in your body naturally.<br /><br />5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.<br />GABA is EXTREMELY relaxing and good for an anxious mind (I have been taking GABA supplements for about a year now)<br />Melatonin is something we all know about to help induce sleep.<br /><br />This combination is just what my body wants before bed. Granted, I still have some sleepless nights. In addition to this drink I often will take magnesium and Passion Flower supplements to help calm me. The taste is great, very mild. This product has made a noticeable difference in my relaxation and sleep.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Let's get away from those sleep drugs!

review/summary: First OTC sleep aid that worked for me
review/text: As an insomniac of many years, I picked up a Dream Water at my local pharmacy, where they're sold in individual 2.5-oz bottles in two flavors, Snoozeberry and Lullaby Lemon.  I've tried every over-the-counter sleep aid there is, and some help, some don't -- this stuff really works.  It makes me very drowsy, and far as I can tell, there are no adverse side effects.  Both flavors are subtle and pleasant, and contain no calories.  The active ingredient is sodium 80 mg, which might be of concern to those on a low-sodium diet, although 80 mg only represents 3% of the average adult's recommended intake.  The rest is their "secret blend" of what I presume is the usual herbals that are reputed to relax you. All I know is that I fall asleep within an hour and sleep better through the night with fewer interruptions.<br /><br />One minor complaint -- the stuff's expensive (hence the four stars, rather than five)!  Even if you buy it by the 12-pk, it's about $2 a pop! I guess it deepends, then, on how bad you want to sleep.  I like having the stuff around for when nothing else is working.<br /><br />So that caveat aside, highly recommended!

review/text: Arrived right on time as usual and could not believe how fresh the aroma was refreshing.<br />I am new to pickling but it was easy to simmer the spices in vinegar and pour it into jars containing cukes and or carrots. Two days later the greatest carrots and pickles I ever tasted. I had thought the spices were too much for it until I tasted the results. With pickling you do not have to use pressure cookers. It is so easy that just about any vegetable can be pickled. Add some tasty treats to the jars (garlic,onions,sugar,hot sauce.....) and you have your own brand right there. There are just too many ways and recipes for pickling to even begin to get bored.

I have been buying these stoned wheat crackers in bulk for quite some time but will not be ordering them again. The product itself it wonderful, delicious and versitile. The way it is shipped is absolutely appaling. I had contacted Amazon to let them know how dissapointed in the shipping I was, hoping it would improve so I could keep purchasing them, but to no avail. I would say that about half of all the crackers I ordered were smashed and broken and turned into crumbs. The excellent price was not actually a deal as I was being shorted half my order every time. Looks like I need to find another supplier.

review/text: I'm a big tea drinker.  I enjoy a wide range of teas but my favorites are PG Tips, Republic of Tea double Green, Tazo's Apricot Vanilla White, as well as Lapsong Suchong and most brands of Earl Grey.<br />I thought I'd give this one a try since I had heard that Oolong is a great weight loss tea.  Well this may be true, but find a different brand for sure.  Looking at the tea bag, the tea is crushed like fine soil and is so small and dry it flows right through the bag into your tea.<br />The tea is very high in tannin which makes it bitter.  Also, keep in mind that tannin leaches iron from your diet so a bitter tea like this is draining your body of a vital nutrient.

review/text: I used to eat another brand similar to this natural flavor, but it disappeared from shelves, so I tried the O.R. brand and liked it better.  Now I'll need to order it from amazon because this has also been disappearing from my grocery store. I cannot understand everyone's fascination with the chemicals that go into 'butter flavor' microwave popcorn!  This has just oil and salt, and I've found that pouring it into a large bowl reduces the saltiness that others have mentioned here. Keeping it in the bag to eat from seems to keep that salty flavor more concentrated. But I don't think it's really that salty anyway. Obviously this is quite the matter of taste.

The salt, combined with the oil cooks up nicely to give it a very savory flavor, almost like some movie theater varieties! It doesn't leave your fingers greasy or oily like a lot of other flavors. I've served this side-by-side with several other popcorns, and this is always chosen by the group as the favorite. If you're watching your sodium intake, just be mindful of how much you have per serving, but otherwise, enjoy this delicious popcorn!<br />[...]

review/summary: Good popcorn!
review/text: I like this popcorn.  I was looking for something without added butter/dairy or a lot of chemicals.  The label says popcorn, palm oil, salt, and mixed tocopherols.  It reminds me of popcorn prepared the old-fashioned way with just oil and salt, which does leave residual oil on your fingers.  (I am glad to see that palm oil is making a comeback.)  It is a bit saltier than what I would prefer but certainly not as salty as other brands I have tried.  Of course, the amount of sodium is given on the box for those who need to know the exact milligrams they would be eating.  In my opinion, they could put just half of the sodium in this, and it would be just right.  Overall, it is tasty popcorn with few and simple ingredients.

review/summary: Great Popcorn!
review/text: This is my other favorite microwave popcorn.  It only has oil and salt and no other ingredients.  So it's kind of like you made it at home in a regular popcorn maker (but much better).  Well, I do use Orville's regular popcorn in my regular popcorn makers (yes I'm a popcorn nut - have 3 popcorn makers at home).  His regular popcorn pops up just as well as his microwave popcorn, if not better.  but this one I know I have on Subscribe and Save, again in the 3 count boxes which is a really nice size when it's being shipped in multi-packs.

review/text: I have bought this brand in the stores for several months and was happy to see I could get it with subscribe and save. But after this last order, I have cancelled my subscription, because EVERY bag in EVERY box was oily on the outside before even being popped. This is quite atrocious. I have not had this problem with the 6 count boxes I purchase in the store. I do not understand why it is like this, but I can't bring myself to continue purchasing this particular product in the 3 count boxes.

review/summary: Good, just a little oily & salty for my taste
review/text: Overall, it tastes pretty good. The pieces of popcorn are more oily than normal and a little saltier, but I have a low daily salt intake, so that could be the reason as well. I also bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004YPV15A">Orville Redenbacher's Smart Pop! 94% fat free butter microwave popcorn, 40 2.9-oz. bags 114 oz Box</a> at Costco and prefer it over the natural oil & salt, just because it is less oily and with the butter flavoring it is surprisingly less salty. Still a good product, it just comes down to your personal preference.

review/text: I appreciate short ingredient lists and this is a great-tasting popcorn. Most other grocery store popcorns have a short novel for ingredients and contain way too much chemistry for something as simple as popcorn.  If you like a lot of butter, steer clear from this.<br /><br />Also, the Amazon ingredient list shows "Partially Hydrogenated Soybean Oil" as an ingredient, which is wrong. That error probably loses quite a bit of sales from people looking for a clean ingredient popcorn.

review/summary: Yuck.  Love Orville BUT Really Hate This Product
review/text: I eat a considerable amount of popcorn every week and it's almost always Redenbacher.  I like the brand.  BUT this product is dreadful.  First, it's salty. Waaay too salty. Secondly, it's pretty greasy.  Not buttery mind you, but greasy.<br /><br />And it gets worse.  On top of those drawbacks is the fact that it smells awful.  It has a sort of chemically odor and what's really odd... it does not smell like popcorn.  You know how microwaving popcorn will make people come creeping out of the woodwork looking for a handful of fluffy corny goodness!  Not with this product.  Heck, my kids won't eat it.  And after experimenting to see if the second bag was as bad as the first, I threw out the rest of the box.<br /><br />THE SKINNY:::<br />I've reviewed over a thousand products and given less than a handful 1-Star. I'm adding Orvilles "Natural" popcorn to that elite list because its just gross.  I despise it and fear to feed it to my children because of the unattractive smell.<br /><br />Stick with Orville's Butter or Lite-Butter or Tender White or one of the flavored types.  They taste good and the smell good.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />upset mom/blogger

The only problem is that amazon frequently runs out of stock on the Light Natural, which makes it hard to get.  (An alternative is to buy Natural + Bearito's Unsalted and mix them together, thereby diluting the salt to a manageable level.)

The after taste of the Royal Oak peanuts was just not as nice as the Peanut Shop ones.

review/summary: ok, they've grown on me...
review/text: I got my Citiz w/ milk and used some of the included Nespresso capsules at the same time I ordered and received the Ethical capsules. I have had a Delonghi EC155 for years (using Illy and Lavazza). I wanted something a little less time consuming and was willing to pay more for it.<br /><br />Here's my review of the Ethical capsules after consuming 7 of them, all my espressos are served as breves with about the same amount of half and half as there is espresso.<br />1) flavor - is smooth, not very bitter, kind of nutty/chocolatey even when I sipped it sans 1/2 and 1/2 it was smooth - maybe too smooth for people who take a lot of milk in their lattes (I don't). (or breves)<br />2) not much crema - what there is seems to disappear pretty quickly<br />3) it is quite a bit harder to close my machine with the Ethical capsule in place, however, you have to be impressed with a company willing to replace your machine if their capsules damage it.<br />4) These capsules are not individually sealed, so you need to consume the 10 capsules within a short period of time, or you'll be drinking stale coffee.<br /><br />If you need/want to save the money, this capsule does that without really sacrificing too much, as long as you drink at least 3 a day, otherwise, that coffee is getting pretty darn stale by the fourth day.<br /><br />Edit: Ok I've drunk about 15 of these things, and when I saw the new low price, I popped for more. I like to drink a lot of espresso, these are good enough to allow me to feed the habit, without wincing. I've got the empty caps coming - can't wait to see how those work, I have a LOT of Illy left that I bought for my EC155 that died on me. RIP (2nd one) I have high hopes for the fill-able caps.<br /><br />Edit 2 - ok, the necaps came and though they are relatively tricky, I'm hoping I've hit the right combo of coffee/tamping, however the one thing they showed me is that Illy in a necap is better than the cremosa in a capsule I don't have to pack myself, etc.<br /><br />Edit 3 - now I've had at least 150 of these (I mentioned I drink a lot of espresso) I will not buy them again. Maybe MAYBE if they went down to the super ultra cheap price they were before, but at $25 there's no way I'm buying them. If you're thinking about it - at 50cents a capsule, just go for the Necaps and fill your own, or fork out the extra for the Nespresso capsules.<br /><br />6 months in and I'm still using this coffee. It's just been so darn inexpensive, and since I drink all my espresso as a breve - well, it' works fine for me. I did start to poke extra holes in the cap (thanks to someone else's review) I just put the cap face down on the counter and take a paring knife and poke a hole (it's easy) and twist the knife a little to open the hole. I also have a serving fork that I use the tine to do the same thing. Then I pop it in the machine. I think because the capsule is not aluminum the hole the punch makes is not wide enough to let the proper water flow through. My experience punching the extra holes has been a richer deeper flavor in the resulting espresso. Try it. :)

Had to do short pulls and a 3:1 ratio was still not equal to 1 weak nespresso cap.<br />The shipping and service was great, just not the product. Plus to add insult, they dropped the price from 25$ a box down to 10$. At $10 try them yourself and you can taste disappointing brown water too!

review/summary: Cheaper but..
review/text: Hi,<br /><br />I have tried both the armonioso and the arabica capsules. The price is better than original nespresso's and they are "greener" but that is the end of the story for me since:<br /><br />1. Taste is for me only at minimum quality and therefore not comparable with the original nespresso capsules that I have tasted. Taste is of course different from person to person.<br /><br />2. I have a Citiz and when I put a capsule in the machine I have to press down the handle with a force that to me seems too much in relation to what is good for the machine. If you take one of these capsules appart you will see that just beneath the visible outer filter is a HARD plastic element, whereas the original nespresso capsules are only made of soft material. I guess this is why you have to press down the handle very hard. As you might have noticed the machine pops rectangular holes in the the capsule. I am affraid I will bend or break some plastic part in the machine.<br /><br />3. When the machine starts to "shoot" water through the capsule it hesitates for a second or two and then it says pop. During this second or two no coffee comes out, only water. After the pop coffee comes out instead. At the same time the flow of the coffee is VERY RANDOM, which means that every cup will be different from the other. There is even less coffee coming out of the machine because of the hesitation and the random flow, compared to an original nespresso capsule.<br /><br />In conclusion; with less coffee per capsule, random taste, and a questionable use of force to put the handle down, the lower price makes these cheaper capsules no longer attractive to me. One star is given for the green concept, but there is a limit of how much you want to sacrifice to go green. It should be noted, that all this could of course be because of my Citiz and how it is constructed compared to other Nespresso machine models.

review/summary: Not bad for the old price
review/text: I'm not exactly an espresso connoisseur, so I have a hard time telling a huge difference between these capsules and the nespresso ones in drinks like lattes. Unfortunately, for less diluted drinks, the weaker flavor in these capsules was pretty obvious. They're not so much weaker that they're undrinkable, but they're definitely have less flavor.<br /><br />At the previous price of 25 cents/capsule, these were an awesome choice for lattes/cappuccinos, but for 50 cents/capsule, I'll just stick with the nespresso capsules.

review/summary: I so wanted to like these
review/text: What attracted me was the savings over Nespresso capsules...I so wanted to like these, but the extraction is inadequate and espresso is weak and not as nuanced as most Nespresso varieties.  Since I paid $25 for the 5 boxes of 10 each, the price has dropped precipitously...now under $15.  I can only believe that despite the pretty package and the eco-friendly claims, Nespresso users will pay a significant price premium to get the consistenly good (if not great), no mess aspects of using Nespresso capsules.  I am reluctant to try other flavors after my experience with Cremoso.
