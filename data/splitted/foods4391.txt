review/summary: Works Great For Studying
review/text: I use 5 Hour Energy for studying and its great! I was first skeptical about using this product and thought it was just another product that a company used mass advertising to make it seem good but the product actually does what they say it does. I don't feel any crash or get jittery after using this (Unless i use this 3-4 days in a row,then i crash. Which i shouldnt have done in the first place) but its a great way to keep yourself awake and focused with studying for exams or college finals. I totally recommend this for college students, but remember to read the directions and don't take more than two in a day. Also drink a lot of water, very important!! Keep in mind anything that affects your mental state or physical can be detrimental if it isn't used properly by following the directions, so please read the directions before consuming this. (Btw, it might be obvious for some people but if you know what 5 hour energy is or looks, its a small body, the size of shot glass, so it not a lot of liquid your drinking, which is good compared to other products such as energy drink, which make you crash).<br /><br />Oh btw, this is a great deal on amazon compared to other stores and websites, at least for the 24 pack. I got it two days with my amazon prime account, that i got for free for being a student(check out the amazon student offer on this website to get a free one year membership to amazon prime) lol, i feel like a doctor/amazon worker writing this review, but oh well. Hope this helped :)

review/text: The product is something you're going to like or not like.  I like it.  It helps get me going in the morning and every once in a while I need one in the mid-afternoon like the commercial says.  Shipment comes fast and it's well packaged.  No complaints on the product or the service.  I love that you can buy it in bulk on Amazon.  So much better and cheaper than $3/bottle at 7-11.

review/text: Needing an energy boost while we were shopping, my boyfriend and I gave these a try.  Neither of us felt the least bit energized, even after a few hours. The only thing we felt was rather worn out and sick later on in the day.  For the money we paid, we could have had Starbucks for a real burst of energy.

review/text: Five hour energy is a convenient from to get that extra kick I need, especially after a sleepless night or when driving on a trip.  I still prefer to get my caffeine from coffee and soda but 5 hour energy is low in calories and a one "shot" stop.  It has a little bit of a chalky taste to me but the energy I get balances it out.  I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGYï¿½ from Smiley360.

review/summary: Unpalatable and Ineffective
review/text: I liked the concept of this product, a shot of caffeine in a vitamin infusion.  Unfortunately, the berry version tasted horrible, like the unwanted offspring between diet gelatin and cough syrup.  It also had no effect on me at all.  In fairness, I am a coffee drinker, although not so much during the summer.  On the positive side, I experienced no negative side effects other than an unpleasant chemical after taste.<br /><br />I know people who swear by this stuff but it didn't work for me.  I would suggest trying a single bottle to see how you tolerate it before committing to a case.

review/summary: Not Bad, Not Bad at All
review/text: After a series of long and rather sleepless nights, I felt I needed a pick-me-up and picked up a bottle of BERRY 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK. I've had the POMEGRANATE and ORANGE 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINKS before. I really liked the taste of the POMEGRANTAT 5 HOUR ENERGY, but found the ORANGE 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK to be disgusting.<br /><br />Though not quite as good as the pomegranate, the BERRY 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK is tasty and a huge improvement over the disastrous flavor of the ORANGE 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK.<br /><br />Like the other 5 hour energy drinks, this shot began working shortly after drinking it. I felt awake and was able to perform my duties until later on in the evening when I finally settled in for a long mid-summer's rest.<br /><br />I still prefer the pomegranate, but if I find myself in need of a jolt of energy and the pomegranate flavor is out, I'll take a BERRY 5 HOUR ENERGY DRINK instead.

review/summary: Can't ask for more
review/text: Everything was in the box and all in date. They added a 10% off coupon for their site and I got the package 6 days ahead of time. I'm assuming most of you are familiar with 5 hr energy but if not its works decently. I have always had low energy that even vitamin B & D supplements couldn't help ( I do still take them to keep my levels in a healthy range). I tried coffee but it messes with my stomach plus it takes to long in the morning. So these shots are perfect in the morning before a workout or going to class. They make you aware and focused instead of completely wired ( for me anyway).

review/summary: They Work But...
review/text: First of all, it should be called "4 hour"energy, so don't count on five hours. Second, most of the flavors (especially this one) are awful. And you definitely need to make sure you eat a good meal before taking one of these; otherwise you'll just feel sick for five hours. If you can remember that though...and get past the flavor, it will give you a nice boost for four hours.

review/summary: Just didn't work
review/text: I tried the berry flavored 5 hour energy today.  I wasn't particularly exhausted, just needed a little boost to chore through some housework that needed doing.  While the flavor was fine (tastes like liquid B-12), I didn't get any kind of boost from the 5 hour energy at all.  In fact, about an hour after taking it I decided to take a nap and slept just fine.  Bummer.  I was really hoping this would work as well as all the commercials say.  :(<br /><br />I will add that I'm a heavy coffee drinker and have been for many years, so perhaps that's why this had no effect.  I'm also not B-12 or folic acid deficient as I get injections for that.  Maybe if I WAS still vitamin deficient and didn't drink coffee this would give the desired boost.

review/text: I prefer the taste of energy drinks, but only drink 1 or 2 a week because of all the sugar and calories.  The sugar free energy drinks just dont taste as good.  I use a 5 hour energy on the days i dont drink an energy drink.  I dont like coffee at all, so this gives me the boost i need to be awake and functional at work in the mornings.  The taste of 5 hour isnt amazing, but it doesnt need to be since it is a small shot of it.  It gives me energy and has very few calories, I am very happy with the product

review/text: I was introduced to these on a cold, early morning march before MOUT drills.  I didn't have time to get some tea and was really dragging because of the previous days physical and mental exertions.  If I don't have time for a couple cups of tea I have this as my standby, instant wake-up drink.  My sons described the "Berry" flavored 5HE as liquefied Smartees.  I tested this by eating a package of Smartees Candy and sure enough it tastes just the same.

review/summary: Gives me that mutch needed "kick in the rear" when I am feeling drowsy
review/text: Make no mistake this is not a substitute for sleep.  If you are tired from lack of sleep then this most likely will not work too well (it can't cure exhaustion.)  However, if you are having one of those days or just your usual afternoon crash this serves as a well needed "kick in the rear" so to speak.  I don't feel like I have just went and slept 8 hours but I do feel awake and like I am able to make it longer than a few seconds without falling asleep if I sit down.  I say if you are on the fence go to the store and buy a single dose first to see if you like it.  I recommend it.

review/summary: Definitely an effective product (for me)
review/text: I seldom review products here but I am sufficiently impressed with this product that I felt it deserved a little promotion.  Normally I do not tend to lend much credence to and am skeptical of most natural supplements' claims, magic elixirs, and other products that I tend to lump into the classification of "snake oil" type products.  For me, this product lives up to nearly all of its claims.  I began taking these infrequently after a colleague at work recommended it.  I'm in law enforcement and now keep a stock of these in my office and in my car.  When you have to push through a really long day (or night) at work, these are wonderful to fall back on.<br />  A lot of people who have reviewed this product attribute its effect mostly or completely to its caffeine content.  No way...  That may be true for people who have a high sensitivity to caffeine, but I drink coffee like water and have a substantial resistance to the effects of caffeine as a result.  The caffeine content in one bottle of Five Hour Energy supposedly equates to one small cup of coffee.  I can tell you that its effect on me is much more substantial than the effect of a small cup of coffee and arrives with far fewer negative effects (ahem... like a trip to the restroom that often follows morning coffee..).  Within 4-5 minutes of drinking a bottle, I always feel noticeably energized, alert, mentally sharper, and physically stronger (endurance wise).  I have only felt "overly stimulated" on one occasion and this was early one morning after having already drank a LOT of coffee.  On that occasion, I think the caffeine in the FHE simply pushed me over the limit.  Other than this one occasion, I have never felt "jittery" after having taken one.  For me it is normally only really effective for 3-4 hours, not a full five hours.<br />  I have experienced Niacin "flush" on one occasion after having taken one, however, I also take a large dose of Niacin every morning (the only other natural supplement I take regularly) and I again think the Niacin in the FHE simply took me over the limit in combination with my daily Niacin dose.  For those of you unfamiliar with the sensation of "Niacin flush" it can be a little intense the first time but is completely harmless and will pass after 5-6 minutes.  Kind of a combination of an intense all over hot-flash/sunburn.  Don't panic, even though the sensation can be somewhat intense, and it will pass quickly if you happen to experience one from the Niacin in an FHE dose.<br />  Since there is a bit of a history of low B-12 levels in my family, I have always suspected FHE's rather large B-12 content may be one reason it works so well for me.  I have no objective evidence that this is the case, however, I know the minimal caffeine content present would simply not have much effect on me.  All in all, I love this product, see no risky or questionable ingredients in it that concern me, and find it a very nice and effective alternative to swilling down coffee to push through a long day or night.  Give it a try sometime when you are dragging.  I think you'll be pleasantly pleased unless you are unusually sensitive to caffeine.

review/text: I live a very stressful, busy life and the only thing that gets me through are Pomegranate 5 Hour Energy Drinks.  Pomegranate is the very best tasting of all the flavors, and I have tried them all.  I used to drink coffee, but hated the crash, not to mention the caffeine addiction.  5 Hour Energy Drinks give me the boost I need mid-afternoon without the jitters and no crash later.  A similar effect can be obtained by taking B12 sublingually, but it is also expensive, and not as tasty.  I also have noticed that I am not hungry for awhile after I drink one...a pleasant side effect.

review/summary: horrible experience
review/text: This product was a horrible experience. First of all it taste terrible, but I could over look that if it worked. It may wake some people up but it also makes you feel absolutely sick.  I became horribly ill after. I was very very tired, but couldn't sleep. I had horrible hot flashes until I wanted to crawl outside and lay in the snow. I was so dizzy I could barely walk.  I tossed and turned in bed for  12 hours! Then when I woke up the next day it was like I'd been drugged.  I was too out of it to even drive my daughter to school.  If my mom hadn't been there I don't know what I would have done because I could not function the night before. In the morning I was irritable beyond belief and horribly sick to my stomach.  I am not a person who is sensitive to medications or vitamins.  I called a friend of mine who I knew had taken it and he told me that he took for for a while and then one day the exact same thing happened to him.  He was so hot he took a cold shower but was so dizzy he fell!  This stuff has not been looked over by the fda (not that they do such a great job) and they do not have potential side effects listed. So just beware!

This is why you end up feeling dead about 4-5 hours after consumption; NEVER drink this to wake up in the morning as the commercials suggest.<br /><br />With that said, if you're about to take a midterm or it's late in the afternoon and you need a boost, this will definitely give you an edge.<br /><br />Also works well as a sleep aid.

review/summary: Only 40% herring
review/text: We haven't opened the jar yet, but the label gives more information than the company's web site does. Water is listed as the first ingredient, then "smoked herring 40%," followed by cuttlefish, salt, potato starch, and other ingredients. It would be useful if the online descriptions were at least as clear as the labels.

review/summary: Organic Spelt Flour
review/text: I make a lot of homemade bread.  I have chosen specifically to use organic spelt flour as a main ingredient in my breads because spelt is an older grain and has not been altered my humans.  I believe, therefore, it may contain more of the natural nutrients than one can obtain in hybrid whole wheat flours commercially produced today.

review/text: This is a bulk rendition of the same wild rice product that you can pick up individually at your grocery store for a bit more money per box.  It's well packaged, and perfectly sized for many of the recipes I use.<br /><br />I've never seen any "worms" -- though fully-cooked wild rice does look a bit like them!  It's really not likely that a company could continue selling a product that was contaminated like that.  For me this has been a good product at a good price. I'll keep getting it here.

review/summary: Salt block is ok in itself but mine came banged up...
review/text: They packed the block in tons of bubble wrap and related materials, but it needs something more or different.  The block weighs a lot and salt is fragile, a terrible combination for shipping.  So I would be shocked if almost anyone receives an undamaged block (at least with the packing used on mine).  The block itself is pretty nice.  It has the general colors and patterns you see in the photos, but since you will use it laying on a counter, there's no light source behind it, so it looks very flat and uninteresting compared to the photos shown on Amazon.  It looks a lot like soapstone or alabaster do when they aren't illuminated from behind.<br /><br />So you should expect that the corners will be smashed up and not very attractive, but other than that it should work fine if your primary purpose is to cook on it.

review/text: Short of getting some unfiltered olive oil from a relative's orchard, this is some of the best stuff on the market in Greece. I mention this in case people in other countries wonder if it's a legitimate brand or just another label trying to make money off the "EVOO" craze made possible by celebrity-wannabe-chefs. The parent company, Minerva, has a long history. Horio (Village) is probably their best olive oil (Spitiko is another one of theirs).

review/text: I made this according to the package directions and it tastes really good.  It has a light caramel taste.  The consistency isn't very thick or mousse-like though - it's more like a cool whip consistency.  I'm going to try to make another box with less whipping cream to see if that thickens it up - I will only purchase again if I can get it a bit thicker.  But if you like the creamy cool whip consistency and love caramel - you'll love this.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003KH23CI">The King's Cupboard Dark Chocolate Mousse Mix, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> is much better, although it is not caramel.

THIS product is just short of being just as great as my gramma's. I use it with my crock pot, meat that's on sale (it's cheaper to cut that into cubes than buying the stew meat) and serve on noodles, rice or potatoes. My problem is that since Lipton took over the Knorr label this product is extremely hard to find - I can't find it in my town anywhere now. I was amazed that Amazon carries it - whew! I'll order a case :)) & also try the sauer braten mix.

review/text: If we had a 'I'm A Fan' button to push, I would definitely be a fan of Tully's K-cups.<br /><br />Usually I drink lots of Tully's French and/or Kona, and Italian is a new favorite that I know I'll be drinking now that I've tried it.<br /><br />When I think of Tully's Coffee House Blend, I think of going into a restaurant and smelling that wonderful aroma of freshly-made coffee. It tastes delicious!<br /><br />At first I didn't think of it as one of my all-time favorites, because it's just an excellent cup of coffee. Good flavor and aroma, not too dark, not too strong, not too bitter, just delicious. I just came back to edit this review and say that it is becoming one of my all-time favorites, just another great option from Tully's.<br /><br />I used to say that I like to keep it around to drink after I've burned out my taste buds on stronger blends and want to calm my taste buds down a little. Now I've found that I enjoy it pretty much any time.<br /><br />One thing I would say about Coffee House Blend is that it will probably please more people in a household or guests visiting than my all-time favorites, which are way too strong for many people. This is a good choice to please more people. It should please just about everyone!<br /><br />EDITED once more. I came back later to say that with all of my other K-Cup options available to me, I keep reaching for the Tully's House Blend. I don't know if it's just a mood I'm in right now or what, but the others just seem like they are trying too hard. Whatever the reason, I'm enjoying House Blend.<br /><br />EDITED still once more to say now my favorites are House and Italian, both Tully's. It's the best!

review/summary: Great coffee, excellent price
review/text: I've been drinking the Tully's House Blend K-Cup coffee for a few years now. I occasionally buy a different variety just to try it out, but always find myself wanting the Tully's more. I have to admit, I do like the new Starbucks K-cups, but they are almost as expensive as going to a Starbucks and buying coffee there, so I'll stick with my Tully's. I find the blend to be just the right mixture of smooth and bold. I can use a single K-cup twice to fill my 16 oz to-go mug and find that it's still strong enough.

review/summary: Full of Rich Flavor
review/text: I've been drinking bold flavors such as Timothy's Rain Forest Expresso and Coffee People's Wake Up Call but have grown tired of the somewhat chalky taste of both.  I recently tried Tully's Kona Blend and it's good but expensive and not available via the "Subscribe and Save" program.  So I took a chance on their House Blend and like it even better than the Kona Blend!  It's a "Bold"<br />K-cup so contains enough coffee to make the larger size cup without it's being weak and the flavor is nice and rich without being bitter or chalky-tasting.  It's my new favorite K-cup!!!

review/text: I first tasted this at my uncle's house on Christmas morning, after he got a Keurig and hooked it up for everyone's enjoyment.<br /><br />I can say without a doubt, that this is the best coffee I have ever tasted. It's absolutely *perfectly* balanced, without a hint of bitterness. Just smooth as silk, it's the kind of coffee that makes you take a sip, curl up in your chair and sigh in satisfaction at the taste. This coffee is actually prompting me to buy a Keurig of my own now, and this will be the very first blend that will go in it.

review/summary: Simply the best K cup out there
review/text: I have been thru them all and Tully's simply makes the best K cups out there. The house blend is great, breakfast blend as well and the hard to find Kona is in a class by itself. Better than Green Mountain, Timothy's, Gloria Jean and Newman's Own. They simply use better coffee beans and the cups are all very consistent. All of their coffees are "Bold" (even the breakfast blend) but the are never bitter like some other Bold varieties. The superb reviews on this brand are accurate.

review/summary: Solid Gourmet Cup of Coffee
review/text: Its just dark enough for my tastes to be brewed on the 7.25oz setting. It has a dark chocolate and brandy aroma. The house blend has a boldness falling in between a medium brew (gloria jeans hazlenut) and a lighter bold brew (newmans organic). The taste is pleasant and has notes of cocoa and malt, and an aftertaste of walnuts. I would recommend this as a keep around the house brew, but not for something to impress guests.

review/summary: Less expensive alternative to the Kona Blend
review/text: I have long been a fan of the Tully Kona Blend coffee. I was disappointed when my local retailer quit selling Kona products!<br /><br />I actually ordered this house blend by accident, thinking that I was ordering the Kona Blend. I had more than 4 cups of coffee before I noticed on the packaging that it said House Blend instead of Kona Blend. I would not have known that it was not the Kona Blend had I not seen the packaging. One caveat: I make "lattes" by adding an equal amount of steamed milk to my coffee, so the coffee flavor is probably diluted for me.  Someone drinking it straight up may notice a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />My bottom line is that it is much less expensive than the Kona Blend, due to vendor and shipping costs, and it is more than good enough for me.  I've since ordered another box.

review/text: Here in Seattle you can't turn around without bumping into a great coffee kiosk, but there is nothing like being able to enjoy a terrific cup of coffee first thing in the morning while still shlepping around in my slippers at home.  As a new Keurig owner, I taste-tested a variety of brands (since it was so easy to do) but my local favorite, Tully's, came out on top.  If smooth, rich, full-bodied coffee can be called comfort food, Tully's has it nailed.  Happily, Amazon shipments arrive promptly.  Yes, K-cup packs are pricey, but life is short.  Drink good coffee!

review/summary: Tully's Coffee House Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)
review/text: I've always appreciated my Keurig brewer but didn't realize how much until I was away from home, no brewer and NO K-cups! I hadn't anticipated the level of 'separation anxiety' I suddenly experienced. Undaunted, I purchased a package of Tully's freshly ground coffee and returned to a conventional coffee maker.  The result was ok - :} but not really the usual great.  Then came reality.  THE GROUNDs.  What a mess! Not only totally inconvenient to measure, but annoyingly difficult to confine to the basket since they always seem to prefer the counter, the sink, the floor, anywhere but where they're supposed to be.  Then, the challenge of disposal-what a mess. Next,the mixing. TOO weak(like "stump-water" I over-heard,) TOO strong...ugh!!!! It was back to that awful trial and error period  which had been so quickly forgotten.  Oh, and don't even ask about the bottled water.  Fortunately the trip was abbreviated and I was soon re-united with my Keurig brewer and my treasured Tully's K-cups.  Lesson learned.
