review/summary: Wonderful
review/text: I bought this set as a gift for my mother in law cause we both enjoy tea. We tried the jade jewel first and it was wonderful. The flower was very pretty and the tea itself was very relaxing. Now I have to buy one for myself.<br />This set is a great gift for yourself or others and the best part is that you can buy replacement teas. If you like exotic flowers and tea you will love this.

review/summary: very small vessel
review/text: Beautiful flowering tea with great descriptions of each flower.  I was somewhat disappointed in the size of the teapot.  It is definitely for one cup of tea only.  The packaging is really nice and makes an impressive gift for the tea lover in your life. My only complaint is the size of the vessel.

review/summary: Not Good
review/text: My mother got this as a gift. The flowers never completely opened and they broke part. You ended up drinking the flowers. The tea wasn't a great flavor either.<br /><br />She also bought be a set of glass cups to drink the tea in. But they got so hot you couldn't hold them.<br /><br />I would stick with tea bags or loose tea and a mesh strainer.

review/summary: Nice package, nice product
review/text: Bought 2 of these for gifts, ended up keeping one for myself. The teapot is fragile, be careful when using and cleaning, or it will easily break. It does showcase the flowering action of the various teas nicely.<br /><br />The variety in this package is nice, bound to be some in here that everyone will like, and probably a few ya won't. But it's a decent price point to sample and find the ones you do like, then buy more of those teas.<br /><br />Some flower and transform quite spectacularly, others not so much. And pretty much all the teas are subtle in their flavors.<br /><br />This make a great gift, and as mentioned before, a great way to sample a few different flavors to see what you will like.

review/summary: I like this tea or perhaps I just don't know better?
review/text: I am an avid tea drinker and have been for years.  I got this as a present for Christmas 2008.  I have since read all of the reviews and think perhaps I am not much of a tea connoisseur after all or maybe it is that some of you all just got back batches of tea.  I think it is a very nice gift set.  Perfect for someone wanting to "try" flowering tea.  The pot is small but I think a bigger pot wouldn't necessarily be better.  I've used the flowers more than once and the tea still seemed good to me.  I've really enjoyed the tea and the tea pot and the box it came in.

review/text: WOW got two of these as gifts, came wrapped very well, both in separate cardboard reseller boxes, and in that wrapped with off white paper.<br /><br />The wooden box is artfully designed and reusable. the teas come in their own smaller version bamboo box as well. your tea pot and tea box are both securely packaged in paper straw.<br /><br />I had to chance to sample the tea which I gave away as a Christmas present with my friend, the teas are in a variety of flavors and flower shapes. the brewing process is unique and very creative, and creates a tasty brew! (it was a great change up from just green tea all the time!)<br /><br />Looking for a gift? this one is at a great price, cheaper now than what i paid for it, and is a large and substantial gift when given. Both receivers really liked them!

review/summary: GREAT for tea lovers, fans of the unique, or anyone who appreciates art...
review/text: This set is AMAZING. I got it as a gift from my husband AND purchased as gifts for others. The teapot is good for about two mugs of tea at a time (so at most it's a tea for two set) but each 'flower' can be re-brewed two to three times and each are DELICIOUS (very floral and light; I'm not even a fan of green tea but this has got me hooked!). There was a special going on when I got it, a buy one get one half off type thing, but I would gladly have paid $19 for one set. The box is gorgeous and the item was well packaged. I also gave one to my mom for Christmas who loved it as well. The tea is beautiful to look at, I'm almost done with my box and every flavor so far has been great. I can't say enough about this great product, and it's cheaper than on numi.com!!!

review/summary: I'm giving these as gifts, but I'd like one myself...
review/text: I ordered two of these as gifts and when they arrived I immediately wished I ordered one for myself. I haven't consumed the tea (as they are gifts) but I can say that I was impressed with the packaging. The case that they come in is unique and looks handmade. I opened one of the boxes (there are toggles on the sides of the box) and the tea also comes in a similar looking package.<br />I am a little concerned that amazon (as well as the numi website) lists this product as kosher (as one of the recipients keeps kosher) but I couldn't find any ingredient information listed so I'm not sure... I hope it's not a huge deal to the recipient (as I've seen them drink coffee here at work from the office coffeepot.)<br />When I was on the numi website I was impressed to see that amazon sells this product for LESS than they do. Wow. :-)

review/text: I bought one for myself and one as a gift to my sister.  We both loved it.  This is a unique gift that should bring joy to one that uses it.  It comes with a clear glass tea pot and several flowering teas.  As you pour the hot water on the tea you can see the tea begin to flower.  In a few minutes the tea blooms into a beautiful flower in front of your eyes and you have tea also.  I recommend this as a gift.

review/summary: Terrible weak tea
review/text: I only paid $12.50 when they had this for a daily special but it wasn't even worth that.  Maybe the tea was old, that is why it was so cheap.  The flowering teas don't flower and float at the top.  Nothing like the picture.  The leaves soak up the water and puff out and fall apart.  But that I can live with.  The tea is completely tasteless.  Just like drinking hot water.  I have tasted many teas, bags and loose leaf and nothing as bad as these.  But the little glass teapot is cute.  And it IS tiny.

review/summary: Pretty Flowers, Horrid Flavor.
review/text: The flowers were great. They know how to deliver there. The pot is very small though. I was only able to pour one cup of tea from it. And the tea? That was a joke. Mine tasted ABOSOLUTELY horrible! I couldn't drink it. Maybe some people who like bitter, overly herbal tastes will like this but I like my tea lighter.<br /><br />(The teapot also burned my hand a little as the glass is so thin- please be careful!)

review/summary: My Take
review/text: While this is a lovely thoughtful gift, don't expect the handcrafted mahogany bamboo chest to be anything you want to display, or keep.  It just wouldn't hold up.  It is crudely made and not what you might expect.  Compare it to something your child might have made at camp when he/she was 7 years old.  You're close.  But, hey, if you like rickety workmanship, then by all means, this is for you.<br /><br />The tea "buds" are nicely hand sewn, and it's a joy to watch them open to a flower.  My complaint is that they are not individually labeled so it is a surprise what flavor tea you are brewing.  The buds don't resemble the pictures displayed as a guide.<br /><br />Overall, the price is about right.

review/summary: Moments of Beauty as Liquid Meditation
review/text: Beauty is sometimes taken for granted. Today's humanity can often be blind to the ever available healing and grandiosity of Nature in daily living and a have a feeling of disconnectedness. There are things one can do to bring our attention back to simplicity and joy without struggle. Making time for herbal teas is one of them.....but having an herbal tea in your own glass pot while witnessing the unfolding of medicinal flowers before your eyes and literally drinking this fragrant Manna from Mother Nature, is healing.....is beauty with the sublime.....it is instant reconnection of one's essence to The Great Oneness. As Numi creators say...it is a "liquid meditaion"..... into the realms of the ineffable Beauty of Peace.<br />I highly recommend it for anyone who wishes this on a daily basis.<br />May you walk in Beauty.

review/summary: It's okay.
review/text: The teapot does not have a spout.  Also, the tea blossoms are not labeled.  You have to guess by matching the picture to the little balls of tea in a bag and hope you got the right one.  The tea is light, if you don't like strong tea you'll like this and has a pretty good flavor.  Keep in mind that this is a 16oz teapot--a smaller bottle of water is 16.5oz just to put it into perspective.  If you use regular size coffee cups for it and not actual tea cup then you will get about 1 1/2 cups of tea each time you fill it.  The blossoms also will come apart slightly and you will get small tea leaves in your cup, I would suggest using a tea strainer.  If you don't own a tea strainer already you can  use a coffee filter to catch the smaller pieces of tea leaves by simply holding it over your cup as you pour allowing the tea to filter through into the cup through the coffee filter.  Also, the blossom may float if it has a few air bubbles in it from drying.  Poke it down with a spoon to make it settle--more for presentation.

review/summary: Not just for Miss Brill's Garden Party.
review/text: Consider this a potential winner for any occasion that calls for a gift that's out of the ordinary yet affordable and likely to be appreciated by the recipient.<br /><br />Half of the appeal is the packaging.  The items could be contained in half the space, but the bamboo box and bamboo "latches" are a conversation piece in themselves.<br /><br />As for the flowering teas, the "blossoming" of the tea bud and the serving of the tea (which doesn't taste like Lipton's but is quite pleasant and pleasurable, with a hint of sweetness) make for a serenely appealing aesthetic.  I thought that perhaps I alone was ignorant about flowering teas, but to my satisfaction my guests were no less surprised and captivated than I by the whole experience.<br /><br />Besides Numi, a company by the name of Primulo is apparently worth checking out as well (if Amazon reviews are to be trusted).  As for this Numi set, one "bud" nicely serves 2-3 people (small tea cups recommended).  It may not be "historically accurate," but I can't think of a better product for illustrating, or introducing young people to, the "Japanese tea ceremony" and its central place in a "stress-insulated Zen-like tradition."

review/summary: Flowering Teas
review/text: I saw a set similar to this at a brick and mortar store during the Christmas season.  When I went back to get it, I discovered that the store was sold out and had no plans to re-stock it.  I was delighted to find it listed at Amazon.com!  I've tasted each of the teas included in the sample and found that I liked some but not others.  I wish there were more explicit instructions regarding specific teas such as the "pearls".  I found that they were a difficult challenge and I didn't care for the taste very much.  I like the Dragon Lily with the apricot flavor and would like to order more of that flavor but it is not in stock at this time.  Ordering more of the sampler, without the teapot, is a bit pricey.  I wish there were more options for those of us on limited budgets.

review/summary: very nice set for the price I paid
review/text: I just received this set, after ordering it for a great price of $12.50. For that price I am very pleased with it. The little glass teapot works fine. The handle stayed cool enough and you have to hold the lid down, but if you use the little "ball" on the lid to hold it down, it isn't too hot and you won't burn yourself.  I brew the tea and then my husband and I each have a middle-eastern style tea glass full and then I brew the next pot using the same flower. If you use a big mug, it would only make one cup, but this works for us. The first tea I used opened up and looked very pretty, the tea was mild in flavor and tasty. I am looking forward to trying the next tea. The bamboo box will be useful for storage of tea-bags etc. Overall I love this for the price I got it at. If I had paid full price, I would have been a little disappointed...

review/text: I purchased two of these sets as gifts.  One is going to my sister-in-law who loves tea, but who also is an artist that I think will really be in awe by this set.<br /><br />The care in the packaging of this item was the first thing to impress me. It came in the standard Amazon box, then another cardboard box, then wrapped in a heavy tissue paper and finally the set itself.<br /><br />Once I carefully got through all of the above, I found a very nice bamboo box with a picture of what was inside.  I decided I needed to peek in so that I could see for myself. The box has button like clasps on the side to keep it closed and when opened the teapot is snuggled in with a box of tea surrounded crinkly brown paper.<br /><br />As I said in my review title, I cannot rate the tea that comes with this set, which is why I only give it 4 stars.  Although if you look at the flowering tea sold separately from Numi here on Amazon you can see that it received an average 4 star review. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFS0CA">Numi Tea Petite Bouquet Sampler Flowering Tea, 4 Count Sampler (Pack of 12)</a>

review/summary: Disappointing tea in a user-unfriendly box.
review/text: I bought this as a little treat for myself and after all the glowing reviews, I could not wait to try the tea.  Steeps three pots and a pretty gift-box to boot?  Needless to say, I was excited to watch those tea blossoms form.<br /><br />First annoyance: Dear lord, is that bamboo box a splinter hazard.  The woven clasps at the side were incredibly difficult to get off and I had to be very careful handling the box itself all the while because the edges are sharp and they hurt!<br /><br />Second annoyance: Superfluous and messy inner packaging.  Bamboo is so renewable and environmentally-friendly that they decided, hey, what's more wasted paper inside the box?<br /><br />Third annoyance: The teapot barely makes enough for one person.<br /><br />Fourth annoyance: The tea blossom not only floats to the top as you pour hot water, it crumbles coming out of the plastic packet.  And on the subject of the packets, I have no idea why "biodegradable tea bags" are listed as a product feature- there most certainly are none present.<br /><br />Fifth annoyance: The most horrendous and unbelievably weak tea I have ever tasted.  It was like boiled grass clippings and I can actually tolerate wheatgrass and spirulina.  I've tried Stash, Choice, Guayak&iacute;, you name it, so I know how tea is supposed to taste.<br /><br />Sixth annoyance: I did not even get to enjoy the visual splendour suggested by the dazzling pictures of tea leaves in full bloom.  They do not open completely and the smell was unimpressive to say the least.<br /><br />Given how awful the tea tasted, I'm beginning to question how "natural" the tea was in the first place.<br /><br />If you want to go with organic, fair-trade, and interesting blends, try something along the lines of Zhena's Gypsy teas.  At this price, I could have gotten the equivalent of 44 corn silk sachets.<br /><br />I'd normally let something this lacklustre go and forget about it, but it infuriates me that this product is being marketed as some sort of luxury item when it is neither fun to drink nor to look at.

review/text: Amazon has a good price on this product compare to other places. This tea set is allright, and the idea to have the flowering tea is kind of cool, (There are better tasting flowering tea in the market such as Harney & Sons.) however. the bamboo box that contain the tea set is poorly made. The orange paint on the box will come off on your fingers when you touch it, and you need to be careful not to get splinters when you are openning the box. If they can package it better it would have been a really cool gift. I originally bought it as Xmas gift to give to a friend, but the quality is not as good as my expectation so I decided to keep it. The flowering tea looks cool but don't expect too much on the taste. I wouldn't buy this product again.

review/summary: Interesting and Entertaining, but tea flowers are really single-use
review/text: This is an interesting item and a great conversation piece. The bamboo box and packaging has a handmade feel about it; the box itself is something you can leave on a table or counter. The teapot seems a bit fragile and seems to be made of an extremely cheap glass, and I often wonder if it could crack during use.<br /><br />The teas are acceptable, if not extremely flavorable. Unlike tea bags or loose teas, you really can't steep these teas to your desired strength. This can be a problem if you like really strong tea.  The "flowers" themselves, although they can be reused 2 or 3 times according to the instructions, are really only "single use". They are difficult to dry, and subsequent pots of tea are weaker than the first.  In general, I thought the teas were bitter.<br /><br />I'd recommend this for a tea enthusiast, but only as a novelty. It's not an extremely high-quality item. It's good, though, if you want to experiment with different teas in a unique way.

Although I was planning to give this one as a gift, I felt the need to open it and take a look.  Shouldn't have done that because I soon knew it had to be mine.  With my first dinner guests after delivery, I boiled water, opened the bamboo box, removed the glass pot, selected the flowering tea from the top of the pile, and brought it to the table after pouring the water onto the tea.  Oh my Godness, what a sight!  I didn't say a word and it was hysterical to see the look of the first person who noticed the flower bloom!  We agreed that it looked like a monster at first, and after laughing amongst ourselves, I poured the first pot of tea into three small teacups.  Yummy.  Poured a second pot, then a third.  Each was great and each time the visual was so lovely.  We came to the computer and ordered three more sets.  I know I'll be ordering more, too, with extra boxes of the flowering teas.  Every part of this set was wonderful, from the packaging and delivery, bamboo boxes, little glass teapot, and tasty teas.  It's a real nice value and very presentable gift. Amazon's prices can't be beat on these!

review/summary: EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED
review/text: Based on the mostly positive reviews, I purchased it. Well, believe the negative reviews. The cheap (think dollar store) glass teapot WITHOUT strainer holds 18 ounces. Since I just received this yesterday, I only used one flower which failed to bloom and the tea flavor was not impressive. The concept is unique, but way too pricey for what you get. As for the bamboo box, it is pretty but not really sufficiently sturdy to store anything except very light weight items.

review/summary: Lid broke, but very nice otherwise.
review/text: I bought this as a gift for Mother's day.  My mom's really into boxes and loved the boxes it came in.  She also enjoyed the tea, though a couple were too exotic for her.  The main problem is that the pot is very fragile.  My mom is always extremely careful with things, so the fact that she managed to break the lid when cleaning it means something.  Overall it was still a successful gift though.

review/text: I loved the tea set, and with the deal I got on Amazon, I was able to buy two of them for the price of one.  The only fault we found with it, is the tea kettle is a bit small. However, the 9 varieties of tea that come in the tea set are fantastic, and the blooms are beautiful.  Well worth the price I got on Amazon.  And the bamboo box that the set comes in is very handy, now I have a nice place to store all of my teas, and when some one comes over, I can present them with this beautiful bamboo box full of teas, it's FANTASTIC!

review/summary: Nice product
review/text: You know i read alot of the negitave reviews for this product, ans notice alot of people refer to it as a small pot ect, I am gathering this is typical amricanism of food product, The pot makes easily 3 glasses when i say glasses i mean traditional tea size not 16oz american size. Sadly the americanism of food is prevelant in everything, DO you know why in europe their cooking can be soo rich and creamy, Because they exercise PORTION controll, Tea is traditionally a intimate drink involving enjoying the aroma and sipping from a small glass with no handles, Anyone here know why NO handles? Because those that say the pot is too hot to handle obviouslly dont. IF IT IS TO HOT TO HOLD IT IS TOO HOT TO DRINK, that statement has only existed for thousands of years.<br /><br />Now this all aside i prefer republic of tea for the bags, never tried their flowering.<br /><br />But i say if you are looking for good tea and drink in a traditional sense then this is a product for you,

review/summary: Numi's Bouquet Tea Set
review/text: The tea is not quite what I expected. The "flowers" are already opened. Other teas of this type that I have had, have been tightly rolled up and expanded in the hot water to form the flower. That was a let down. The tea its self did have a good flavor. As for the pot, the lid has no catch so you have to try to hold it on when you pour, or it falls off (usually into the cup and splashes). The pot gets VERY HOT and is hard to hold - especially the lid. On the whole, I was very disappointed with this set. I would not recommend it to others.

review/text: This tea set was my reward for the hard work put into my flower gardens and it was with great anticipation that I waited for the package to arrive.  How disappointing!  The musty, dank smell hit me before I ever saw the contents of the box.  It was so bad that I took it outside to open it for fear of releasing mold spores in my house. The tea pot is very small and fragile and I have yet to bring myself to try the tea because of the moldy smell.  I would not give this as a gift.  I am so very disappointed.

review/text: I gave this as a gift to my mother; when she poured hot water into the little glass pot that comes with the set it cracked from the temperature shock. The water wasn't even boiling. We used a clear Pyrex measuring cup; not as aesthetic, but it can take the heat.<br /><br />The tea tastes very good, so it still has that going for it. The flavors are not the usual ones you see in the grocery store, but they have some very interesting and subtle things going on in them.<br /><br />It might be best to buy just the tea on it's own, and find some other clear pot.

review/summary: Made a wonderful gift
review/text: I bought this set for my sister on her birthday. She, my mom and I sat down and prepared one of the Jasmine flower teas. From the moment the leaves hit the water, we were in love. The teapot was beautiful with the bloom showing through as it expanded, and we enjoyed four brews from the same "flower." Granted, by the fourth teapot, the flower was a bit tattered, but the flavor would have probably lasted through a few more brews. The set is beautiful, and although the box is a little flimsy, I loved it and, more importantly, my sister loved it.

I tried it the first time on a table full of guests...and die-hard tea party ladies.<br /><br />None of us knew what to expect - it was wonderful - to say the least - lots of oohs and ahhs!  The tea (can't remember which was used first) was delicate and tasty.  It was enjoyed by everyone.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the second time I made tea - it was fairly bitter - but the presentation was still spectacular....and being a good hostess - I had the "back-up" teapot of regular tea on the table.  Nobody complained as everyone enjoyed the show.  I will purchase more tea.

review/summary: An Amazing Gift Idea
review/text: I purchased this teapot for a friend's birthday present. I figured it would be a novelty because she loves tea sets... Her reaction was stunning, though! She is absolutely nuts over this little glass teapot and beautiful flowering teas. She called me when she opened the package and saw the bamboo box. Then she called me again when she opened the box and saw the tea pot and bundles of wrapped tea leaves. She just e-mailed me because she was finally done playing with the tea bundles and made a pot - her first try was the 'Jasmine Pearl' - she said it smelled heavenly and her husband said the flavor was excellent and the whole process reminded him of an opportunity he'd had to spend time w/a tea master in Berkeley.<br /><br />All in all, this was a big hit with my friend, and her surprise and enjoyment speaks volumes of the quality of the product.

review/summary: Poor packaging
review/text: The tea seems fine, although I have not had a chance to try it yet. The teapot is also lovely and adorable.  The problem I had was with the box. Some of the parts weren't finished (the coloring of the wood) and then, when I took off the picture on the front, there were dead bugs underneath it. There were also dead bugs where the paper had been glued. Moreover, the glue would not come off, at all. For the price, the tea and the teapot were an good deal, but for someone like me who's scared of bugs.. it was a bit of a shock. I realize that many people had perfectly good boxes and no bugs, so I most have just got a bad one.

review/text: I got this set when it was offered as the goldbox deal. I absolutely love it. It comes in a bamboo box. The box is very good-looking. The glass teapot is great in size. The teas come in a smaller box that is situated inside the larger box. So far I tried Starlight Rose, Dragon Lilly and  Jasmine Pearls. Jasmine Pearls is my favorite so far. The teas not only look very beautiful as they are unfolding in the glass teapot when some hot water is poured on them, but they also taste very good. They last about 4 teapots. If you are looking for something new and exciting for your tea time, you found what you are looking for! I will definitely buy again!

review/text: Nice set, but it would have been much nicer if the box had been allowed to remain the original bamboo color (perhaps only with some clear lacquer), if one strip of the bamboo in the front part of the box had been stained like the rest, and if the glue used to hold the paper sticker on the box did not mar the finish when removing the paper.  The description furnished by Amazon could have been more explicit, too. The ingredients, much more valuable than the box (but the box is important too), are as advertized.  This would have rated five stars, otherwise.

The bamboo box is exotic looking--definitely not a throw-away.  This makes a great gift for tea drinkers or a treat for yourself.

review/summary: Impressive, even to a 74 year old Asian American father.
review/text: I got this for my dad, who is 74 years old as an anniversary present.  When I told him I got him "blooming tea" on the phone, he didn't sound too thrilled and said something along the lines of, "maybe I'll give it away."  Of course I didn't take offense because let's face it, that's how old Asian people are.<br /><br />Anyway, I guess he opened it up, and it changed his tune right away.  Not sure what he was more pleased with: the cool bamboo box that he stores his little trinkets in now, or the fact that he'd never seen blooming flower tea before.  Regardless, he was a happy camper, and I got a good price from Amazon and Amazon Prime.

review/summary: Nice teas, but the packaging is ugly.  No way I'd have paid full price for this.
review/text: I bought this set at the reduced price, and I feel I got no less than what I paid for.  I didn't get much more, though, so I imagine I'd be upset if I paid full price for this set.<br /><br />We were hoping to be able to salvage the boxes for reuse in case the contents were bad, but we're just going to be throwing them out.  It is handmade, but the stain is an ugly orange (not mahogany), and there is no laquer finish, so the bamboo splinters.  Also, there is a lot of wasted space in the box, so there will be a lot of padding material to throw away.<br /><br />As for the contents, we tried the dragon lily last night, and it is a very pleasant tea for a quiet evening after dinner with no harsh flavors.  I'd never given in to the markup on flowering teas, but at the discount price, I decided to give it a try.  It is definitely fun to watch as it unfurls and the swirls of liquor fill the pot.  We're very happy with the tea, as far as the tea itself goes.<br /><br />I see some reviews for people complaining about the flavor of the teas.  The instructions say to pour boiling water into your teapot.  They even say to bring it to a rolling boil!  Most of the teas in this set are either green or white teas.  NEVER NEVER NEVER use boiling water on green and white teas.  You'll extract awful flavors from the leaves while destroying nice ones and ruin your tea.  Boiling water is fine for the black teas, but 175 to 180F is the optimal temperature range for green and white tea.  Steep for 3 to 4 minutes as they say (no longer!) and you will have a pleasant tea to drink.<br /><br />As for the pot, I wasn't actually expecting much.  It's a small, thin glass thing with nothing special about it.  However, it is quite the right size and shape for watching these teas unfurl.  It's an ideal size for two people with 8oz cups.  Steep, pour, and start steeping again while you sip.<br /><br />After we're done with the flowering teas, I'm going to buy a strainer and use the teapot for smaller brews, when I don't want to make a full pot just for myself.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with what I got.  I just wish the packaging could have been nicer, as I'm sure a decent fraction of the price tag went towards it in vain.  It would be a nice gift for couples, and really embodies "tea for two" as you both sit and watch the flowers bloom.

The flowers didn't always open the way they were supposed to, and even when they did I sort of felt like I was drinking tea with a giant sea anenome stuck in the teapot.  The tea itself was pretty good, and it's still an interesting novelty gift (more power to these people for coming up with this idea), but I just don't think it's all it's cracked up to be.  I'm going to try some more soon, so my opinion may change, but right now, I'm a little disappointed.

review/text: These flowering teas are a perfect way to slow down at the end of the day and remember how beautiful life is.  I was amazed to find out that each of these creations are made individually.  I looked on Numi's web page and found that they are "hand-picked organic tea leaves hand sewn around flowers into bundles or rosettes by artisans in China."  I was amazed and captivated as the tea slowly unfolded into exquisite blossoms.  The tea itself was both delicate and delicious.  I recommend this tea to anyone who has an appreciation for handcrafted arts and is looking for the perfect end to any day.

review/text: Overall I thought this would be great but kinda disappointed what I mean is the colors of the flowers were not vibrant they all were kinda green sickly looking plants and only three teas I really liked said they tasted like what they were suppose to, I still haven't tried them all and that's because I don't normally like black teas, I'll be getting to those later in the month. I love the tea pot as my mother in law is always hogging the big metal one, so I place this little pot in the microwave and heat up the water and than have my tea, its quick and easy and the handle keeps me from getting burned. It is smaller than expected since it comes in a pretty big box. It says hassle free packaging but I laughed because getting it open was pretty hard to do. It is dishwasher safe and cleans up easy it is really cute and I love the pot, and it was fun to try something different I do love the tea but If I buy tea again I'm buying the satchel version and not this bulb stuff again as it can only be used two times really. It holds about one cup of tea. If you love tea this was more for personal fun, but overall not for drinking a lot of tea. Overall good starter kit for watching flowering tea but if your a tea drinker buy what you know and trust.

review/summary: Musty Smell and Poor Taste
review/text: The packaging was very musty smelling! After through out the shredded paper and airing it out for weeks, the smell has come out of the boxes to the point that I may consider using them for something. The tea itself had a terrible taste! I bought another box of the same tea somewhere else and it's not so bad as what arrived in this set. Still, I'm not very impressed with the taste of the tea. Also, the flowers in the set did not have good color and were very drab. Also, the teapot holds a very small amount, as others have said. I would not recommend this at all.

review/summary: I don't know if I can give this one away....
review/text: This is an absolutely beautiful tea set--and it smells wonderful without opening the packaging! I have decided it is unfortunate I bought this for as a gift for my best friend because I think I want to keep it for myself! No...this is for my BEST friend, and I'll stop rescheduling our Christmas lunch, really.<br /><br />The bamboo box holding the tea set and teas is very pretty, and I agree that it would be great to use for decorative purposes either separately or with the tea set. Because of the strong, yet very pleasant smell, I am eager to try the flowering tea with my friend. I think this is a gift anyone can be proud to give and excited to get. It isn't a very large gift, however, but everyone knows that good things come in small packages, right? (Not THAT small really, I'm assuming each flower ball will make two cups of tea because of the size of the pot.) It will be really great for those "girl times" when we just want to curl up in a chair and confide in each other. The only thing I wish I had purchased with the set was one of the tea warmers.<br /><br />Five stars.
