review/summary: Wonka Shockers aka ShockTarts
review/text: If love TART candy - this is for you.  It is a sour, chewy version of 'SweeTarts' but NOT soft like taffy.  From a size perspective, each piece is much larger than a 'SweeTart' sort of on the order of those chewy mints with the name like 'M---os'.<br /><br />This product used to be sold under the SweeTarts brand by the Nestle Company as 'ShockTarts'.  Then it was sold as a Wonka Candy Company product.<br /><br />THE ONLY PROBLEM: Shockers/ShockTarts are no longer made.  If you love 'em - get them while you can!

review/text: These are food service packs of one pound of the crumbs and broken pieces of the small snack-sized Nutter-Butter cookies. They are wonderful on ice cream. I just got a case of them (36 packs) for 33 cents each at the 99-Cent Store. $9.99 each seems a bit pricey comparatively.

review/text: My dog would eat these all day long if he could.  He loves them.  Gets all bouncy and happy when he sees me getting one out for him.  They only last about 6-8 minutes, but I have a large dog who is a healthy chewer.  I feel good giving him this treat because of the ingredients, and because it's made in the USA!  Recommended, though a bit pricey.  I love my dog, so he's worth the cost.

review/text: I purchased both Jell-O Cook & Serve Pudding & Pie Filling, Chocolate Fudge and the Chocolate only. I prefer the cooked version - it seems to have more body & flavor. I use DRY MILK - and contrary to the instructions does not thin out. Plus, if concerned about 'thinness' adjust the amount of water, using less in the beginning, while cooking to get a thicker pudding. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to have a delicious cup of pudding. The time spent in cooking is well worth the effort.

review/summary: Tasty Candy. Hard not to eat too much
review/text: The taste, at first, is great. However, if you have a sweet tooth, and havnt had any real sugar in a long time, you may be tempted to over indulge. I could easily have eaten a whole tube at a sitting. This would be a mistake on 2 levels.<br /><br />There is some magical balance, where you can eat more than their specified serving and have no ill effects. However, if you have one too many, bam, your going to have some digestive tract issues that you may not enjoy. A few times I managed to tip over that balance, since i bought all 3 flavors. Speaking of which, I found that their various flavors are not terribly distinctive from each other.<br /><br />The second level of mistake is that as you have more the flavor begins to wear on you. My wife ate too many right out of the chute, and now cannot stand the smell of these things. It took me about 2 tubes over a couple to get to that point where I felt obligated to eat them, having paid good money for them, but didnt really want them anymore. I like candy, so I would eat them again, were the presented. But its going to be a while before I would actively go buy any again.

review/text: I purchased the 4 oz size, and it arrived with a few sample packs of other salts as well. This stuff tastes very good, and is hot, although in my opinion, it wont kill you like other ghost pepper oriented products might. I've been using it on eggs and also threw some in with my beer when making brats the other day. Both have been excellent uses. I would say use it sparingly, especially if you are sensitive to heat, but the flavor is good and the extra kick is nice. A definite winner IMO.

review/summary: Very impressed
review/text: I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).

review/text: I just received the spice bottle of this ghost pepper salt. Large crystals like you'd expect from sea salt, infused with ghost pepper. I put in a pepper grinder and seasoned some deep fried french fries. Adds a nice flavor and a little bit of kick. I'd say hot store bought mass produced salsa is hotter. Flavor is great though, and I would buy again. If you want something really hot, look elsewhere. If you want nice flavor with a little kick this is a great product.

More of a medium heat but the flavor is good.<br /><br />I will place another order simply to determine if I was unlucky and received a package which had been sitting around a while.<br /><br />UPDATE: My second order was perfect.

review/text: Flaked Fish and Shrimp most likely has the best ingredients in Fancy brand.  As another review pointed out, it's 15% more protein.  Not only that, if you look at the ingredients list, you can see "Ocean Fish, Fish Broth, Shrimp" at the top of the list.  The rule is that higher percentage component in the food goes first.  Having ocean fish and shrimp is great, as opposed to "liver or meat-by-product".  In fact, there is no meat-by-product in the list.<br /><br />Of course, it's also that my cat likes to eat this. Therefore, I subscribe to this on Amazon as my cat's regular meal.

review/text: This is the only Fancy Feast recipe that I buy, as it is free of grains and meat by-products, but the quality has taken a hit.  Some of the fish chunks are so dense that I can imagine they dried on the deck of some ship before being rehydrated during the cooking process.  The cans are so full of "broth" that I need to be careful where I open them, preparing to clean up the inevitable spill.  This never used to happen; it is due to the much-higher proportion of water to solid food in the can.<br /><br />This food has gone from a special treat to a Fancy Feast in name only.

review/summary: Cats like it but don't "see" the sodium nitrate.
review/text: First ... this is one of the Fancy Feast dinners my cats like. And I appreciate the fact that I can identify the ingredients visually.<br />Printed here is the list of ingredients, finally in type I can read without a magnifying glass. I did not know they add sodium nitrate, which is carcinogenic. I have had three of my cats over the years die of cancer. Most of the tumors were in the stomach.<br />I can see that the food looks like food, and it is acceptable regardless of how "red" it looks. To add sodium nitrate to a catfood, when the cats only care about the smell and condition, is simply endangering the life of a pet. Animals have difficulty enough. I still buy this, but not very often. At least it does not have animal or fish byproducts. But I will add an anti-angiogenesis product to their diet in hopes it will counteract the nitrates, at least until I can either find a product I can trust or start cooking for them myself.

review/summary: The only food Omar eats
review/text: Omar, the 18-year old diabetic tomcat who is the love of my life, has no front teeth and this is the only thing he'll eat besides treats. Even though it's a bit more expensive - I can never find more than 3-4 cans at the grocery, so, with Amazon Prime, this really saves me time. Thanks!

review/summary: excellent quality at an aforadable price!
review/text: I usually purchased this food from petfooddirect.com, but I have to say that Amazon.com sells fresher food than petfooddirect.com.  The food in the can looks as if it was just recently canned.  It's very flaky with whole pieces of shrimp in it, and my cat eats it like it's going out of style! The food is nutritionally sound. If you allow Amazon.com to ship it to you with regularity you save even more money, just twelve dollars and change for a case of 24 and free shipping too!  All of petfooddirect's promotional codes still doesn't allow you to get the food freely shipped, and the same goes for petco.  The cost of shipping is really ridiculous!<br />The price of flaked cat food is so expensive.  Fancy feast sells food called 'Fancy feast appetizers' that sell for $1.25+ and you get so little in the container! My cat loves them but they cost so much and you're getting less than 2 ounces in the little plastic container.  I'm afraid that I've begun to buy human tuna at my store for my cats since it's on sale all the time, mostly at 99cents per can, (particularly Bumble Bee chunk white tuna).  You get more in the can for less money.  The chunk light tuna is better than chunk white tuna and has less exposure to mercury which of course is the healthiest for both humans and cats alike.<br />I also buy Bumble Bee canned Salmon and I give my cat just a little from it every day while refrigerating the rest in a little garlic powder and spring water and my cat loves it!  My cat loves the fish juice so I add a good amount of spring water to the salmon that I refrigerate in a Tupperware-like container I purchased from QVC(some plastic containers have a chemical-like odor that are not healthy for use so I never buy them).  The Bumble Bee Salmon also has bones in it that are edible(very crunchy).  Tuna in general & most de-boned fish are low in vitamin E, calcium, sodium, iron, copper and many other vitamins(according to pet specialists) but the Bumble Bee Salmon has bones and skin in it (with all that good fish oil in the skin)for the cat's coat.  I can get Bumble Bee Salmon on sale for $1.99 a can and sometimes less at stores like CVS, Walgreens & RiteAid and it's much cheaper to feed my cat this food than to buy him canned cat food that can make you go broke.  But, the only canned cat food that I can recommend in terms of affordability and excellent quality is Fancy Feast's Fish & Shrimp, may they never stop making it!

review/text: I try to choose wet food for my cat that i would be willing to eat if someone bet me $50 or less to. For the record i'm a very picky eater.<br /><br />There's some gross brown stuff in here that makes it borderline, but it smells like a can of tuna, and the texture is pretty similar. If i closed my eyes, and mixed some mayo in it, and slapped it between wonder bread, i'd be willing to eat it for at least $35. But for the price, and the quality of the food (whole chunks of fish, shrimp as you can see from my photo), this is a great deal. It gets a standing ovation from both Zeroichi and I.

review/summary: Top Notch Food For The Price
review/text: As others have pointed out, this may well be the best cat food available from Fancy Feast.  Most of the foods you buy today have fillers, corn, and other by products that your cats don't  need and are not good for them.  This has fish and shrimp with no grains or fillers. For the money, this can't be beat.  And Amazon's S&S makes the deal even better.  I have a hard time finding it at supermarkets or WalMart, never seems to be in stock.  Glad to see Amazon carrys it and also is part of subscribe and save.  Wish more products were like this.  Of course, the best cat food in the world is useless if your cat does not eat it.  My cat is finicky, she will eat most of this, but not all.  She will not touch other wet foods such as Natural Balance, Wellness Core or Chicken Soup for the Cat Lovers Soul. My second cat will not touch any wet food. They are excellent foods, but useless to me. I bought a case of one wet food and can't get her to eat any.  With this food, I bought a single can before committing to a case. I feed my two cats California Natural dry food. They both like it and no allergy problems.  Wish Amazon sold this as well, instead of third party vendors with high shipping costs.  Hard to find locally.

review/summary: wow!  the best/healthiest Fancy Feast!
review/text: wow, this is amazing food....ok, so i am a human writing this on behalf of my beloved snowshoe Mocha.  My Mocha is a loving female who doesnt care to eat...she would rather cuddle than eat.  LOL  She nibbles a few bites of her wet fancy feast food (she has tried the grilled and all of the classic variety packs Fancy feast) and few hours later comes back to eat a few more bites.  She does this about 3 times til there is none on her plate.  I only put about 1/3 of a can in her plate.<br /><br />Well, today is her first day eating this and gosh she almost ate it all!  she lapped up the food so greedily.  lol.<br /> I think this is Mocha's most favorite flavor of the Fancy Feast flavors so far!<br />I like how the food smells like real fish (think:  canned tuna smell) and has actual fish meat even with the skin(!) which is the healthiest part of the fish!  i even see those tiny tiny brine shrimp here!  wow!  This is really the REAL stuff!  If you check out nutritional analysis, the crude protein is at least 17%---the highest of all Fancy feast variety!  I also like that there are NO ARTIFICIAL ANYTHING included in this flavor unlike most Fancy feast varieties out there.  :(<br /><br />my only negative is that there is a bit more broth than what i like there to be.....kind of like the grilled Fancy Feast (but a tad less).<br />I do not have a problem with this item being 'product of Thailand'.....better than 'product of China' which i would never buy cat food from no matter what.<br />Other than that, this is top notch stuff!<br /><br />PS;  less than 5 min later, Mocha returns to finish the rest of her meal.  ;)

review/summary: The ONLY flavor of THIS I will buy! No gluten or fillers!!
review/text: I would not normally feed any cat Fancy Feast brand- gluten, byproducts &mystery meat is NOT healthy for ANY animal! If you have done research ( which u should!) on cat food ingredients, you would realize that your  hurting your cats w/that &in turn will spend much more $ on Vet bills than u would on "grain& gluten free" foods. However, THIS particular flavor has NO gluten &minimal filler if any. Also @17.5% PROTIEN it towers over most more expensive brands!! So this is a good pick at a resonable price for those who don't wish to spend, or cannot spend the $for the better brands. Ppl, our Pets are our Children, u wouldn't feed ur kids any old' junk so "RESEARCH" your brands ingredients! It's not all the same & it's not all marketing hype- I lost my beloved cat of 10 yrs to a sudden Diabetic COMA, DUE to her wet& dry FOOD ( which was "fancy feast"!) So if this saves 1loved companion, I'd be thrilled..<br /> Btw-my cat had never once had any problems, in her 10 yrs.by the time she had any symptoms( which I now realize they WERE symptoms) the vet said " at the time the finnally show symptoms, it's generally too late! So just because your animal "seems" to love the food & show no problems, does not mean there aren't any :( . Hope this helps Someone~<br />UPDATE:  2nd case I have received  & I must agree w/others- THIS FOOD HAS CHANGED!  My cats USE to love this flavor, now it's a can of soupy mush! Yuck! The all ( but 1of 6!) walk away & it ends up wasted!  I am canceling my Sub &save immediately .this stuff is gross &I will no longer feed any animals this. Please read NEWEST reviews , as this formula HAS CHANGED! Will not buy anymore. ;(

review/summary: Dont buy if you value your cat's life
review/text: Used to be an excellent brand and my cat's favorite. Over time, quality declined, and recently, I find several large (close to 1 inch sometimes) fish bones in most cans. Very dangerous to a small animal like a cat especially given how excited they can be when eating, not paying attention to it. I am now picking through each can with a tooth pick for a couple minutes and cleaning bones out before I feed the cat (is that your idea of feeding?), and once i'm out of those, I will not buy them again.<br /><br />If I learn of any future improvement, I will update the review and score.

review/text: I am so picky about what I feed my cats, but my one super finicky cat will only eat this food when she is not feeling well.  She is the weakest of my 3 babies in that way and you know how it is...you do anything to make them feel better.  This has been on the shelf for several years now just for those times when she won't eat anything else...until today.  I opened a can from a new case of food and it was totally different than any other cans she has eaten.  Instead of nice white chunks of fish, it is mostly brown and smells awful...not spoiled, just different in a bad way.  She would not eat it!  The whole case is packed up to go back to the store and I will not buy it again.  She loves the Natural Value tuna with toppings too, so I guess that will have to suffice.  Very disappointing when they change a good thing!!

review/summary: Fail . . . used to be a fav!
review/text: This used to be a good product, with small pieces of light tuna throughout the can, tiny shrimp on the very top and a bit of broth. Now it looks trashy. The fish is in big pieces and the pieces are raunchy and red looking. None of my cats will eat it even if I cut it up for them (yuck!). Since my cats used to love it so much, I bought another case a couple months later and it was the same thing.<br /><br />Since tuna for people comes in larger cans for about the same price as this, I don't understand why they had to stomp on the quality of this. I guess there's nothing that can't be made cheaper and worse! (Makes me wonder about their other food, too - because I can't tell as easily what they're doing to it when it's not whole food).<br /><br />Well, back to reading reviews again.

So, I've now signed up for Subscribe and Save on this product and won't make the mistake of changing foods again. The girls get 1 can a day split between the two of them. Idgie will literally do somersaults when I bring out the can! It's worth a little extra money to make both my kitties happy, so it's now a "must have" in our home.

review/summary: Shrimp & Flaked Fish w/o cereal!!
review/text: My cats love this Fish & Shrimp Feast. It is actually flaked fish with some tiny shrimp and nothing else.  Finally, some real cat food. This is a bargain for me because none of the grocery stores stock this flavor, including our local Sam's Club; coupled with free delivery and no sales tax--this is a true value-added bargain. We subscribed and found that once a month is too often, but once every two months is a perfect addition to the 36 can carton plus the 48 can case of Friskies we buy at Sam's. A subscription is wonderful when the big snows come to our mountains and we can't get out of the driveway!

review/summary: Shan Chapli Kabab
review/text: I could not find the mix for the Chappli Kabab here on amazon.com, so I wrote my review for this instead.  I live in a remote area of the wild west Rocky Mountains where Indian or Pakistani cuisine is completely non-existent in the form of a restaurant.  Purchasing a cookbook online, even our grocery stores don't sell the spices needed to create such dishes.<br /><br />I met a Pakistani woman on a flight from LA who introduced me to these Shan mixes.  She said they are very authentic, spicy.  All you need to add is the meat/vegies.  The instructions are printed in English on the back of the box and are easy to follow.  She sent me some and I tried them.  They are delicious.  And yes, SPICY!!!!  I was afraid to use the whole packet of spice for my chappli kabab, so I used 2/3's of it.  Even that much was alomst too spicy.  The flavor was magnificent.

review/text: This is by far my favourite readymeal rice!  I'm pretty picky when it comes to rice, and I love Indian food, so this is just perfect.  Some tips: the rice tastes better if you give it longer to set.  I like to make a bit early and let it sit for maybe an extra ten minutes while I'm doing other things.  And when you come back to it, the rice is at the perfect texture and the taste is richer and the heat stays well in the takeout box.  I'm so happy I can buy this in bulk now cause I could seriously eat this all day long.

review/summary: Decent Tea - Even If Samples Are Random
review/text: I converted to drinking only loose leaf tea last year and gave this gift pack a try. While it was decent, I have since had better and will probably not be ordering it again.<br /><br />For one, it is impossible to tell the age of the teas in the tins. For Pu-erh, that's not such a big deal, but for green teas and the Jasmine, you want normally want to get a batch that is a fresh as possible. PierMall is a big reseller of products from around the world, and there is no telling how long what you get had been sitting in some huge warehouse, slowly losing flavor. Another consideration is that you get a random sampling of Chinese teas, no the specific types that is implied by their Amazon listing. If you visit their website, you will see that they draw from this selection:<br /><br />* China Black Tea<br />* Tiekuanyin (Iron Goddess of Mercy)<br />* Oolong<br />* Lung Ching DragonWell Green Tea<br />* Yunnan Pu-erh<br />* Jasmine Tea<br />* White Tea<br />* PuErh Tea with Chrysanthmum<br />* Lychee Black Tea<br />* Rose Black Tea<br />* Rose Green Tea<br />* Osthsmum Green Tea<br /><br />I don't know about you, but I'd like a little more certainty when buying a product. If you are new to tea and trying different varieties out, or are getting this as a gift, then it isn't such a big deal. Of what I received, the Oolong was the best. The Pu-erh was okay, though nothing special, and the Jasmine has a slight aftertaste, leading me to believe it was artificially flavored. Good Jasmine tea should be flavored by the scent of the flower, nothing else. The green and blacks were just okay.<br /><br />You could do worse if you were to buy teabags, but not much. I would recommend buying good loose leaf tea from dedicated tea vendors who are more upfront about what exactly they are selling you. At this price, you really can't expect to get quality tea. But if you are looking for an inexpensive gift for someone who doesn't know their tea, you could do worse. At least afterward you have some cute little tins in which to store future teas! It may cost a little more, but I think one would be much better served by ordering samples from a company like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YT18B4">Heavenly Teas</a> or Adagio.

review/text: I am rather new to Tea, but this sampler is great way to discover and choose your favorites. The tins are packed with, in my opinion, good quality dry packed leaves, no stems or dust, or at least nothing I could complain on.<br />Tins are clearly labeled, and the quick search for the labeled names on Wikipedia makes a great learning experience going along with the tasting as well.<br />I'm on my second round thru 6 tins, and with each teaspoon making more than one cup of tea  by multiple steeping, I think these 6 tins may as well last for couple of months, much more than its "sample" title may reveal. For some teas, second steeping(s) may give a better or different quality than the 1st one - in any case it is a good experimenting exercise, along with water temperatures etc...<br />If you want to "try and see... what is this tea thing all about", go for this sample package!

review/summary: Great Intro to Loose Tea - Reasonable Price and Good Quality
review/text: I got this sampler because it came up after a search for Pu Erh.  People wrote that they didn't get certain types of tea listed, but I got all 6 as listed.  The tea is good quality, like everyday Chinese drink.  I ordered some Rishi Pu Erh as well, and I must say, Pier Mall doesn't market as well as Rishi, but the tea is much better quality, regardless of wheter it is "Kosher" or not.  That said, I bought other Jasmine Tea, which I initially preferred, but I saw that the leaf quality is better for this generic brand sent in the 6-pack and I have grown to appreciate the quality.  Each box is about 5-7 servings, and has a good pure leaf taste.  If I could get larger quantities wholesale, at a good price, I would buy this tea, because I think it is good quality and very drinkable, and at bulk, should be reasonably priced, as opposed to these overpriced places that sell tea at $6/ounce.  So far, the best tea I've ordered off of Amazon, along with the Pu Erh cake from Generation Tea.

There are two teas labeled 'oolong' and I assume one is the puer? I'll need to find someone who reads Chinese to know for sure. One jasmine that I didn't like b/c it didn't have that fresh jasmine scent/taste. Overall, for the price (I paid around 11 bucks) it was OK.

review/summary: not what I'd hoped for
review/text: Items received weren't damaged or defective, merely reflective of bad advertising and labeling. The sampler pack is described as "6 tins (Pu Erh, Oolong, Jasmine, White Tea, DragonWell Green Tea & More!)" What came were two Oolongs, one "Black"  that I guessed would be the Pu Ehr, two Green  and one Jasmine. No White, and no explanation of what kinds of Oolongs and Greens were sent. The labels on the tin had only these descriptors and some Chinese labeling. Fortunately my son is fluent in Chinese, and I sent him a photo of the tins. He replied, "Well, you have one that just says Oolong tea, the other Oolong is a Tie Guan Yin, a nice flowery Oolong (unless its a Taiwanese Oolong, in which case it will be a darker).  You were right about the black tea, it's pu-er.  The green tea on the top middle just says Chinese green tea, so its anyone's guess what that is.  The other green tea is West Lake Long Jing."<br /><br />I've tried all the teas, and they're not bad. In fact, I really like the one that is labeled as just "Chinese green tea" and would love to know what kind of green tea it is. I just learned that Long Jing is another name for Dragon Well. So for $12 I get to taste a good variety of decent teas, but gain little knowledge about what I am tasting. I'm really disappointed I didn't get a white tea, since this is where my education is really lacking. If I'd been sent a white tea and told the exact kinds of green, jasmine and oolongs I was getting, I would have rated this a 5 star purchase.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they refunded my credit card $2.50. OK, that's something. I hope they have this supplier deliver what they advertise and clearly label what their teas are.

The Oolong tea is full of stems (good teas dont pack in stems, there should only be leaves) and has a weird smell to it, not to mention the flavor is kind of bland compared to actually good Oolong tea. I'm not sure why this got so many great reviews, because these teas are just cheap and awful. Would definately not recommend this product. Buy your tea elsewhere!!!

review/text: I was very excited to receive this item; the description made it sound like the samples would be diverse.  I was disappointed to find that my pack only contained Jasmine, Black, Oolong tea, and two green teas.  I would have loved to have a white tea or at least some clarity on what I actually received.  The terms "black tea" and "green tea" mean very little since there are so many different types of black and green tea.  I would appreciate this product much more if they actually told me exactly which teas I was sent.  It's all well and good to say that it was a random selection, but if so they need to state what was actually selected.  Especially since different teas require different preparation, it is not appropriate to be vague; this could compromise the taste of the tea.<br />I have yet to sample the teas, but since my initial reaction was so negative, I thought it was worth noting.

review/summary: Good for what it is
review/text: I love tea and wanted to give loose leaf a try. However, loose leaf tea can be pretty expensive and I'm picky with tea. Not a connoisseur at all, just flat out picky. This pack seemed perfect! It was cheap and I would be able to have a variety of teas. I received black tins that included:<br />Lung Ching (dragon well green)<br />Pu-erh<br />Jasmine<br />Lychee Black<br />Tikuanyin (oolong variety)<br />Oolong<br /><br />So far I've only tried the Tikuanyin but it's decent. Again, as I'm new to loose leaf I might not be the best judge but I find the flavor pleasing. There are stems in all of the tins and some of them are quite big. To their credit the tins are filled to the brim with tea. In the end I think you really get what you pay for. The tea is nice enough but not as high brow as typical loose leaf teas.<br />**Update**<br />Taken down to two stars. The more tea I try the less I like it. I'm probably going to end up throwing all of these out. You're better off buying bagged tea; it's a higher quality!<br />Lychee had a highly metallic taste to it. Took two sips and threw the rest out.<br />Lung Ching was bland and had a dull flavor. Not at all bright and clean as tea normally is. Seemed maybe it was old and stored poorly.<br />Pu-erh was alright, nothing special. (I'm new to Pu-erh tea so I may not be the best judge on this one. I enjoy Foojay Dim Sum Pu-erh quite a bit. This was like a toned down version).<br />I found the more of this I drank the more stems I was picking out. Seemed to be almost half stems.

review/text: The quality and flavor of each Tea was worth 3 times the price. This is my 2nd. order. Was very sup prized my original purchase was just to get the Tins for my new Tea Rack and transfer my over priced teas into the tins. but now I'm going to have to wait until I use them first.

review/summary: Decent tea for the price
review/text: I bought this tea to go with a tea tumbler as a gift, so I cannot attest to the taste (although the recipient said she liked it) but it did not smell robust, aromatic or bold. It smelled stale and mediocre. The tins are beautiful, but next time, I think I will spend a little extra money to get one flavor that smells robust and lively.

review/summary: To random
review/text: The tea sampler is to random. It would be great if the sampler was design to let you select type of favor then a sample is sent on your taste. This was so out there. I got a couple that, to me taste a lot alike and two others that also taste a lot alike. If you don't know what kind of tea you like, or want to try different kinds to get an idea you may like the idea of a sampler. That's why I got it, but the quality is not there. I believe that the differnet teas taste the same because it's old and been packaged together so long that they have blended together, if that is possible. It's ok but not good. If you are someone that is starting off with loose tea and want to try different favors to see what you like, this is not for you. I feel that by trying this old loose tea it could turn you off from wanting to take the time to enjoy loose tea.<br />Please go to a tea store in town and try there if you're new.

review/summary: Great Teas
review/text: Great product, nice containers - works great in the Adagio Teas 16-Ounce Ingenuitea Tea makers.  The tea is very tasty and only a small amount (like a teaspoon full is needed to make a delicious beverage).  These are great for folks that are not familiar with these teas and want to sample something other then the cheap bag teas.

review/summary: China Loose Leaf Tea
review/text: Liking a specific blend of tea is such an individualized choice. I liked some of the teas in the little tiny tins but not other flavors. I originally chose this product to round up the amount of purchase so I could enjoy free shipping. However, I'm glad I chose this product because it allowed me to further explore some different teas that I had not previously tasted. I just think it was a bit too expensive.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: At first I was disappointed with how small the container were, but when I realized how little it actually takes to make a cup of tea in my ingenuiTEA pot (which I got for a Christmas present and HIGHLY recommend), I became an almost instant fan.  Nice sampling of teas, seem to be good quality.  As someone new to teas and trying to switch from coffee to tea, I am very happy with this sampler :)

review/summary: OK Tea
review/text: The tea was alright. I'm afraid it may have been sitting a while, but it was still drinkable. This product may have benefited from an airtight container while it was sitting in a warehouse waiting to be purchased.

review/summary: Ok selection of teas.
review/text: Teas are only ok, some taste kind of stale and not at all what they should. Green teas (like dragonwell) tend to taste the worst out of the bunch, jasmine and black are ok. Oolongs also taste fine.

review/summary: Nice Little Random Sampler
review/text: Many reviewers did not realize and/or did not like that these are randomly selected prior to shipping. The surprise element was a major reason I chose this sampler. The teas I received were Oolong, Pu-er, Jasmine, Lychee Black, China Green, and Tikuanyin Oolong. All of the teas tasted anywhere from decent to quite good, with the China Green being the stand-out. The Lychee Black would be awesome except for a sort of stale, dusty aftertaste. Up front the Lychee is fruity and sweet, quite enjoyable. Seconds after swallowing though it's like you've just licked a dusty old book from someone's basement. Very odd. At any rate, the tins are adorable so when the tea is gone I will probably reuse them, they'd be great for storing buttons, loose change, incense or what-have-you.
