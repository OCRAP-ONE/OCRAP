review/summary: Hollow!
review/text: I have several dogs in several sizes.  Nylabone products are always the ones that last.  When my pit bit off an arm of this toy I almost fell off the couch.  He bit off a Nylabone!  It wasn't until I found the toy outside a few days later and picked it up, realizing that it's not solid.  Makes me wonder what other toys are not solid from NB.  We still love the brand, but I would examine new toys carefully before buying them to see if I can tell if they are solid or not.

review/summary: Our dog totally adored this, but destroyed it in about 48 hours
review/text: We picked up one of these bones at a local pet store last week. Our dog picked it out herself; I held out two different shaped bones for her to sniff to see if she had a preference, and she actually grabbed this one's package out of my hand. She's never shown that much interest in something in the distracting environment of a store, so it came home with us. For two days, it was her constant companion, she absolutely LOVED this bone. She'd grab the whole thing around the middle and chew it on her back teeth with her head tilted back, so that she was chewing the red part more than the nubs. This might account for it's early demise... at the end of the second day I found it on her dog bed in three pieces, including one that was just the right size for an intestinal obstruction, and I quietly made it disappear while she wasn't watching. She's still looking for it two days later, sadly, and I thought about trying another one in the largest size available, but I don't think I want to risk it. We got the wolf-size the first time, and our dog is a 48 lb. Boykin Spaniel/Pit Bull mix. She is is a pretty serious chewer - she's the only dog I've ever had chew a Nylabone Galileo down to a nub that had to be thrown away and replaced - so this might not be a problem for most dogs.

review/summary: It's hollow!
review/text: My dogs are 55lbs and 25lbs, within a few days they chewed through this bone which started to fall to pieces because it is hollow.  If your dog is not a super chewer it might be good for them, but if your dogs gnaw nylabones into shanks like my dogs do, I would not recommend this.

review/summary: My dog loves this, but is already destroying it
review/text: I have a 70 lb lab/hound mix who loves to chew, so I always buy her the Nylabone Durachew toys. This is my first time buying this one for her and it arrived today. She's had it for about 4 hours and is already destroying it and I literally just saw her eating pieces of it as I'm typing this. It's going in the trash. Summary: My dog absolutely loves it and I don't. I should have ordered her another Galileo; it might shed little white flecks on the floor or injure my children when she flings it across the floor, but it's a lot more durable and safer for her to chew on than this one (and she loves it).

review/text: My dog is a serious chewer and loved this so much I am purchasing another.  It was her favorite toy and lasted a few months until small red pieces that connect to the outside nubs started to break off.  The toy provided several months of daily chewing and amusement and even though it didn't last forever, it was a good purchase.

review/summary: Not for powerful chewers!
review/text: I have a two year old German Shorthaired Pointer who is a very powerful chewer.  Nylabone is her toy of choice so I ordered this one after having previous success with other Nylabones.  This toy lasted all of 4 days!  The ends are made of the usual durable Nylabone material, but the center is not.  The material in the center is MUCH weaker.  My dog found this out and was able to chew right through the center.  What a waste of money!

review/text: This is the second DuraChew item that I'm purchasing for my Bernese Mountain Dog.  These toys are great and they last!  My dog loves to chew and destroys almost anything I give him, but this is the only toy has lasted (I purchase him a new one every 4 months) and he is still interested in playing with.  These toys are heavy so it will scratch/dent a hardwood floor if it is thrown or dropped, but that is the least of my worries.  Great product!

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I bring my dog to PetSmart daycamp twice a week and was told by the staff that she loves to play with this particular toy during camp.  So I bought one for her to play with here at home.  That was yesterday, and she has barely touched her other toys since she received this.  She is a powerful chewer, despite being only 21 lbs. and she has already done a bit of damage to the ends, but nothing that would require my taking it away.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, is that this toy is made in China while other Nylabone toys say, "Made in USA."  Well, either way, I will keep this one until she destroys it, but I think I will take it away from her when I'm not around.  I don't want her playing with this one unsupervised.<br /><br />Nylabone is great, my dog always has to have at least one or two around at all times!

review/summary: "stick"ing with this winner!
review/text: We decided to try this Nylabone product based on the positive reviews and could not be happier on the purchase.  Our 1.5 year old/ 57 lbs mix pit is an active chewer and does well with all the Nylabone items we've bought for him so far.  Although the hollow stick seems a little heavy for him to carry around, he loves holding it and chomping away.  You can stick treats inside for more activity, but depending on your dog's chewing habit it might not be necessary. We'll definitely purchase the Souper size one again!

They like the texture, shape, and taste of this item a lot, but we're able to pop off one of the four ends pretty quickly.

review/summary: Excellent for chewers
review/text: The petite one is tiny which wasn't easily discernible from the description - they should include sample dog breeds for each size do you know which one to buy.  But the product seems well-made despite the description being lacking, in my opinion.  No smell and the color/shape keeps my pupp very interested.<br /><br />The petite one is for very small dogs - chihuahua, min-pin, etc.  Think: under 15 pounds.<br /><br />The regular size (wolf) is for medium dogs.  Beagles on the small end up to 50-65 pounds.<br /><br />The giant size (souper) is for very large dogs over 65 pounds.

review/text: My dachshund is a powerful chewer for a 20 pound dog.  Although he loves any good chew toy (and especially one he can tear up and spread around the house), the Nylabone DuraChew Double Bone Bacon in the Wolf size is the only one he will select first every time and will stay with the longest.  It lasts longer than every other chew toy I've purchased.  The only drawbacks I see are the price -- in many stores they sell for over $12 each -- and the fact they seem to go on backorder regularly in those stores where they are discounted.

review/summary: Another HUGE HIT By Nylabone! A Sensational Dog Toy!
review/text: Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys. A long time fan of Nylabone products - because they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans, and have been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.<br /><br />A rarity among dog toys that beg for our attention with an army of adorable kitty cats, bunnies and an endless parade of cute toys.<br />With the majority of them resembling road kill in a very short time.That said, we had a feeling this particular toy being  made of the so rock solid Dura Chew material and scented like Bacon - they would be a huge hit.And boy, were they ever. Our Bulldogs simply LOVE this toy!<br /><br />Our oldest  Bulldog "Harley" is finicky about toys and loses interest after a hours, but kept this chew bone in his mouth for hours - even walking around the house with it looking like he was puffing on a big fat ole' stogie.Elvis, our 6 month old Godzilla chewer couldn't leave it alone for one second - and managed to do some serious damage.<br /><br />This toy is just Great.<br /><br />1) Huge size makes it fun for any medium - giant size dog.<br /><br />2) Can be carried around (or dragged)  if your pooch is strong to lift it.<br /><br />3) Holds up very well, the material is surprisingly strong and resilient.<br /><br />4) Quality construction means no seams - no pulling the top cover off.<br /><br />5) Bacon flavor is very subtle and adds to cranking up the crazy. Making this toy even more fun for your dog.<br /><br />6) Wood texture is molded into toy<br /><br />7) Thick but Hollow so adding a treat to crank up the crazy is effortless to do.<br /><br />If you're looking for an excellent toy, that can stand up to big time chewers - you can't go wrong with huge stick from Nylabone.<br />Like any dog toy supervision is key and an effort should be made to enjoy this toy along with your pooch under a watchful eye.<br /><br />5 PAWS UP!

review/summary: My Dog Likes It
review/text: I have tried giving my dog, a heavy chewer that can demolish large reindeer antlers within a day, a variety of different Nylabone products.  The problem with many Nylabone products is that they are plastic or rubber and their flavor is not particularly attractive to the dog.  As a result, my dog is often quick to abandon them for the furniture, my sneakers or any of the other things that we buy them these products to prevent them from chewing.  I tried giving this Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Dog Chew to my dog because 1) it is bacon flavored so I hoped my dog would like the taste and 2) it looked a little bit different from the other Nylabones.  So far my dog has spent more time working over this particular Nylabone than he has almost any other plastic or rubber chewing toy that I have given him.  I am not sure whether it is the flavor or texture that he likes.  But I am thrilled to give him something other than rawhide that he likes to chew on.  Like other Nylabone products, the DuraChew Hollow Dog Chew is extremely tough.  I believe it was designed specifically for heavy chewers.  While my dog has definitely made some dents in it, it is still in pretty good shape and I expect it to last two or three months.  Every dog is different and you never know exactly what they will like.  But if your dog is a heavy chewer and you want to try something a little different from most Nylabones you might want to give this a try.

review/summary: good stuff- but online prices..
review/text: I calculated the per-can online prices to be close to $6 after shipping. SIX DOLLARS.. a can!<br /><br />My neighborhood grocers carry this chili for anywhere from .69-$1.29. YES- on sale I buy this stuff all day for sixty-nine cents a can. There is possible light at the end of the tunnel for those of you who live East of the Rockies- the company closed their plant here in the Pacific Northwest and will produce this chili in Iowa.<br /><br />I love this chili. Nothing like home-made, but it's good nonetheless. Great for chili dogs.<br /><br />I keep a case of the 'thick' variety in my emergency survival box, and rotate it out every year. Three winters ago, I was snowed in for a week, and for three days I had no power. (My camp stove worked great, and if you had to, you can eat this straight out of the can.)<br /><br />In a emergency/survival situation, I'm sure that with enough drinking water, you could live on this for many days. I think that the only nutritional drawback is the sodium content. That's the price we pay for ready to eat processed food- it would be great if they made a lower sodium variety.

It is the best chili I have ever eaten. You can bet I will buy more.

review/summary: My opinion of Nalley Chili
review/text: I find Nalley brand canned chili to be the BEST TASTING of any I've tried.<br />Our trouble is we CANNOT get it in our Indiana area. To have it shipped here is quite costly. I have friends who keep asking: where can I get this good tasting chili? It's now owned by BirdsEye I think.

review/text: I'm 54 years old, I've been eating Nalley Original Chili for about 44 years.  The last cans I bought are "different"... different can, and it tastes more tangy, with a vinegar taste, reminds me of ketchup.  I will no longer buy Nalley Chili, the end of an era...  it's sad.<br /><br />I called Nalley, they have no record that the recipe has changed, but trust me it has changed for the worse.

review/text: I ordered this chili at the request of my parents.  They ate it in Montanna and loved it.  So said, the chilli was not available in Texas, but I found it at H.E.B. grocery.  It is as good or better than homemade.  Not too spicy but has a good flavor and no nasty meat pieces.  The beans are really good and creamy.  We now have it in our pantry.  I normally do not have canned food but I will keep this in stock.  Really good.

review/summary: Way better than Hamburger Helper
review/text: I just tried this flavor of Velveeta Cheesy Skilets along with my family last night, and instead of using ground beef, used ground pork, one can hardly tell the difference between the two nowadays. Anyway, I basically prepared according to instruction, but when adding the cheese sauce from the packet I also added some taco seasoned cheese to the mix and allowed it to all melt and come together. The result spoke for itself, my family and I wolfed it right down. For me, it was quite palletable, very creamy, plenty of sauce and just the right amount of pasta. My grandma and dad both had no complaints either.<br /><br />Needless to say after trying this and two other flavors, I don't think I'll ever go back to Hamburger Helper again. It's a little more expensive than that brand, but the fact that you need less ingredients (no milk) the cost ends up being cheaper in the end, and you can use that milk for something else that requires it. Trust me, if you do it right and spruce things up your way, this will be something worth buying again and again. I look forward to getting myself a couple more boxes of this stuff in the near future. My tip is to definitely add something of your own to the mix and add some more cheese as well. As is I am sure it's still really good, but it's when you add that special something and make it your own, that the results are worthwhile. I give it four very solid stars.

I followed the instructions on the box, used 96/4 ground beef and it came out looking NOTHING like it does on the box.  It looks super on the box, don't buy into it.<br /><br />I had to add tobasco sauce to make it have any hint of flavor.  The velveeta sauce just consumed everything to be honest.  The salsa mixed in is non-existent along with the taco seasoning.  There are no naco chips included in this meal, but there should be.<br /><br />Velveeta has done nothing to get me away from making Hamburger Helper the next time I use a dinner kit.

But hey, sometimes you need these kine of comforting and greasy food.<br /><br />I'd rather say this is closer to Mexican spiced cheesy lasagna instead of nacho supreme.

Very bland, no flavor and even with some "spicing up" was still almost unedible.

So I must give it only one star.

review/text: This stuff was inedible crap. Trust me, I eat almost anything even some flavors of Hamburger Helper.  I tried 3 of the 4 flavors trying to have an open mind, but this was the worst.  This stuff was so bad, I decided not to even bother trying the 4th flavor.  Maybe velveeta alone with pasta would be salvageable but once you add the other crap seasonings, I gagged.  I actually threw out the whole dinner.  It is nasty stuff.

review/text: This tea tastes very nice. Its sweet and according to ads its the natural sweetness of peaches. However ingredients include aspartame and sugar. Despite this, there is not an adverse aftertaste. This tea is excellent brewed over ice. Great summer drink.  I also brew my Peach Tea hot. Add a little cinnamon, maybe a bit of froth, and you have a really nice winter drink. If the truth be told I prefer the Peach Tea hot.

review/summary: Alessi will MAKE your dressing!
review/text: I'm new Balsamic vinegar. A friend gave me a bottle of Alessi, and I've made a note of its name. I couldn't find it in my local store. I've bought another brand, but the new brand says nothing about how long it has been aged, for example, in wood, and I suspect that I have been spoiled for lesser quality.<br /><br />I didn't like vinaigrette before, even with the highest quality olive oil. Now that I've made it with a good Balsamic vinegar I understand why. Well made and properly aged Balsamic vinegar is nothing like even the highest quality red wine vinegar. It has a nice sharp tangy taste, but it is, in and of itself, a dressing for salad. That is why it can be used alone or with oil to dress salads.<br /><br />Alessi has a sweetness to it that suddenly makes sense of the notion that nuts and fruits can be included with miscellaneous salad greens to take a salad in a different direction. This product opened up new vistas of salad making to me, and I give it a full five stars and encourage anyone who likes to play with food to try it.

review/summary: Drink a cup of flowers
review/text: This is great tea for the person who likes a really fragrant sweet type of tea with strong fruit flavors. I have brewed an entire box of this already and have tried it both hot and cold. First off, the packaging is first rate. It's a class act, looks like you spent a lot of money. Each tea bag is individually wrapped in a sort of plastic/foil, and are incredibly easy to open. The tea bag istelf is quite large, but holds a small amount of tea. It's not like those lipton teabags everyone knows - full of tea up to the brim. It is strong tea, but I would recommend 2 bags per cup at least for regular strength. You only should let it steep for 3-4 minutes. The box says no milk should be added and I totally agree. That would really detract from the taste. Often, milk is added to quell bitterness of the tannin in tea but this tea I suppose has none or very little. It's a very fragant cup, almost too much (of course I am using 2 bags per cup). It's like inhaling a spring day. I'd say this will be a cup of tea you would want without food as this sweet flowery taste and aroma will overpower any food you might be eating. I am going to order more of this tea in the future.

review/summary: Good for Cats
review/text: Excellent product! I feed my 2 cats grain-free foods after discovering that the "urinary infections" one had been having was actually an allergy to glutens and grains, both the major sources of protein in most pet foods because it's cheap and has a long shelf life. The vet tried selling me expensive "prescription" foods, but those have the same ingredients, just three times the cost. There are a number of good choices of grain-free foods out now, so your cat can enjoy some variety, though they like consistency and i always introduce a new food mixed in slowly with familiar ones. The chief advantage of this one for my cats is the shape of the pieces. It is a star shape, which causes them to eat it more slowly than the little disc shapes of many foods. The discs are often swallowed whole and then regurgitated, so the cat doesn't get the nourishment and you get the mess. I will say one more thing about this brand- it's well digested and tolerated. Pardon my saying it, but some of the super concentrated high protein foods cause an amazingly bad smell in the litter pan. This one actually helped my gluten allergic cat have a little firmer stool consistency and doesn't leave my eyes watering from the odor. Finally and importantly, the cats eat it up, often even when i give them some canned food alongside it. They really like it. I will be buying Precise Chicken Formula for as long as they make it. It's good for cats.

review/text: I have been feeding my cat Sporkie this food since he was a kitten.  He is now 16 and has NEVER been sick!  I have added the senior variety to his diet (from Precise) but mix it with this one as well.  I did however try to change his food twice in the last 16 years and both times it did not go well.  Once about 10 years ago I tried switching him to Max Cat and he became very angry and aggressive, switched him back and he was fine.  I tried about a year ago to add the "all natural herbal" variety from Precise and he got sick, got a UTI, that however, was the first time in his life he had been on an antibiotic!  I swear by Precise!!  It is a pain to have to have it shipped, as I cannot buy it locally any longer, but so worth it for Sporkie.

review/summary: Very nice coffee blend
review/text: My wife and I are using this in our super-automatic espresso machine.  It has been a long time since I tasted authentic Jamaican Blue Mountain, so I can't say how faithful a clone this is.  But we really enjoy it.  Nice carmel flavors, mellow, mild acidity, complex aroma and flavor.  Medium roast so not too oily for the machine and no burnt flavors common with some dark roasts.  We've tried several other coffee bean direct blends, and this is our favorite so far.

review/text: This roast is very mild yet flavorful.  It to me is like a very lucious Caramel flavor, that releases all of it's yumminess through your taste buds and through your sense of smell.<br /><br />I love this roast.  It is the best I have bought and I have tried several of the darker roasts from coffeed bean direct.<br /><br />They all have been good for the price, but this roast is my favorite.

review/summary: First cup worthy of high praise
review/text: I just wanted to get this out while it was still fresh on my mind.  If the first cup is any indication of what the remaining cups will be I think I have found my coffee mate for life.  This stuff is really good.  I was initially concerned that with it being in a 5lb bag it would not have the flavor I was looking for, but I was wrong.<br /><br />Now with all that said, a dose of reality.  I know the QC can not maintain the same level of taste for this coffee for the life of its production and I realize that I have got a good batch.  But as long as it stays basically the same I am a huge fan of this coffee<br /><br />Way only four with this high praise?... nothings perfect.

review/summary: Old Coffee, this is  not fresh!!!
review/text: Bought this coffee after reading about how it is roasted and packed for shipment to ensure fresh coffee.  The coffee is dry and old.  It is not fresh roasted, packed and shipped fresh.  It was old and dry coffee and doesn't make that fresh smooth Jamacian brew I paid for.  Now I have 5 lbs of old dry coffee.  I would not recommend purchasing from this company, the coffee is a severe disappointment.  Amazon should not sell this inferior product on the site.

When we could aford a malted milk we had to have Horlick's malt as the competetion's malt was so inferior.  Again, not quite as good as 50 years ago, but still the best I have been able to find.

review/summary: I Love this Sauce - For Some Things.
review/text: This is a wonderful sauce who's value I would put at about the same value per-ounce as A1 Sauce. I would even pay a slight premium more if you love it as much as I do but not a huge premium.<br /><br />For burgers this is hands down my absolute favorite topping.  A properly seasoned beef-patty w/ lettuce, Swiss cheese and Lea&Perrins Traditional Steak Sauce make a perfect burger.  This sauce is has great tangy, well-seasoned, slightly spicy-sweet flavor that is very unique.  I recommend every one try it.  Right now, a few local restaurants around me have it on their tables.  If you see it in your area, you really should try it on anything beef. Also, you can substitute this for any A1 Sauce flavor to try it out.<br /><br />In my opinion, Lea&Perrins has a done a very poor job of marketing this wonderful product in the U.S., and are really short changing themselves and their Customers. Way too often, I ask for this sauce in a Restaurant or Grocer and they'll say they have it. But, they are always thinking of the L&P Worcestershire Sauce and are always confused there could be anything else. L&P really could have named the product better too to make it very distinct from their truly "traditional sauce" which is, of course, "Lea&Perrins Original Worcestershire Sauce". Their Worcestershire is great in it's own right, but these two sauces have very different flavor profiles.  This is the second time this product has become commonly available in the U.S. and I am really hoping they do a better job of getting the word out this time.<br /><br />I love this sauce and I'm sure you'll at least like it a lot.  Try it and let me know what you think.  Thanks.

review/summary: This is my favorite sparkling mineral water.  Love the high mineral content and "edge" it has.
review/text: I have loved this bottled water for years and years, but I've never found it in bottles other than the large one-liter glass ones.  Those are heavy to lug around and, as I prefer to drink out of the bottle and not a glass, not professional or usable for work.  So I was thrilled to find the smaller bottles on Amazon, and I was very surprised when my order showed up on my doorstep so very quickly after placing it. This is a high mineral content sparking natural water, so it's got more of an "edge" than other sparkling waters or mineral waters.  There is a bite to it that I like.  I find it more satisfying than most waters.  It is higher in sodium, so that may add to the kick, too.  But anything to get me to drink more water is a good thing for me. Just be aware of the sodium content if you are on a low sodium diet.  For me, it is indeed the "Queen of Table Waters" as it promotes.  I've tried to find waters I love as much (as it is harder to find and previously I could only find the liter bottles), but I've never found a water to match Apollinaris for me.  And now that I can get it in the smaller bottles, I will be drinking it more often at work and on the road.  This is one of those waters people generally feel strongly about.  You either really love it or it may be TOO much for you because of the higher mineral content.  I love it.  And I'm so pleased to find a reliable vendor where I can get this water in single-serving sizes and delivered right to my door instead of lugging the bottles home from the store.  This is a great find for me.  I recommend trying this water (it's hard to find in the stores where I live, but I periodically come across it) because you may love it as much as I do.  I haven't come across any other mineral water that is like it or that I love like I do Apollinaris, and I've tried A LOT.  Apollinaris is by far my favorite.

review/summary: Perfect size, perfect carbonation, perfect edge
review/text: My wonderful friend, an athlete, drinks only San Pellegrino (in big bottles, because that's the only way she can get it) because she feels the degree of carbonation is very pleasant.  I had her pour some for me and was suddenly aware of how important this component is.  I tried the Apollinaris hoping to find the same delightful sensation in a bottle size that would be good for me on the trail and in my backpack, and it's even better.<br /><br />I hadn't thought about the "edge" in taste of a carbonated water until reading the prior review, but that is better in Apollinaris than in San Pellegrino, in my opinion...and the sparkling waters I buy from the store are a whole other problem.  I have always loved sparkling water, particularly at room temperature. The Trader Joe's are full of large bubbles and by contrast to Apollinaris, feel like pop rocks going off in your mouth.  Also, when you open the plastic bottles at room temp, you are treated to a shower - they always bubble over.  Crystal Geyser has the same issues though it's slightly less carbonated than Trader Joe's.<br /><br />Apollinaris' bubbles are smaller, nothing happens when you open the bottle, it's great chilled and it's great at room temp, and the mineralization gives it a fresh, dry taste (think of the difference between a sweet white wine like a riesling and a dry white like a chardonnay). I have become addicted!  If it came with options of lemon or lime flavor I'd give it 10 stars. Great, refreshing product.  Good enough to induce me to give up all forms of soda!

review/text: I am not a tea drinker.  I typically can't stand the taste of tea.  I have to drink highly spiced and fragrant blends if I choose tea as a drink.  This Christmas Tea fits my style perfectly.  It smells so warm and perfect; like the holiday season. It tastes equally yum.  It reminds me of Russian Tea that my grandmother made each Christmas when I was a child.  We bought this, originally, as a gift, but decided to keep it for ourselves and enjoy throughout the rest of the year!  It is a little bit of Christmas in every mug!  No issues with shipping or packaging -- all was sent well-protected and on time.

review/summary: Excellent lower cost alternative to Starbucks!
review/text: For many years I was grinding my own beans each morning and having 2 cups of of Starbucks Pike Place Roast. I was convinced I couldn't wake up properly without it and never considered another brand or flavor.<br /><br />THEN the economy tanked and something HAD to be done to lower my overall costs. Enter Maxwell House Breakfast Blend!  After trying a few REALLY 'Brand-X' types plus Folgers I finally settled on these large blue plastic jugs of ground Breakfast Blend.  Using two small plastic scoops for a small 2 cup pot I am able to both enjoy my morning coffee AND save a ton of $$ in the process.<br /><br />In the 2+ years I have been drinking this coffee I have yet to run into a stale batch and the taste and strength seems pretty uniform as well. I REALLY like it.  I have found I need to be a bit careful about how much I use as you can easily cross the line from flavorful to bitter but other than that my experiences have been very good and quite stimulating!  Maxwell House is now my new best friend in the morning.  And if you measure correctly and use good bottled spring water it REALLY IS "Good to the Last Drop" !<br /><br />For the money I don't think you can beat this coffee and that is why I wrote this review and recommend it.

review/summary: Breakfast Blend Blurred By Bad Business
review/text: The item itself deserves 4.5 stars as its a deliciously mild (not too acidic) quality roast that can easily be "strengthened" by a second pour through the coffee maker, but in no way is it worth almost $16.oo per 33oz container that these thieves are trying to bilk us for.<br /><br /> I'd been getting these every few months from the company and was very satisfied with both the quality and s4ervice until they recently canceled my "subscribe and save" subscription and jacked the price up 104%, not including the additional shipping charges of $7.43.<br /><br /> Coffee prices have certainly been creeping up and it should come as no surprise that we see that reflected in our coffee purchases online, but when a company over inflates the prices to this level (especially during economic times as these) there's no way I can support them, or purchase merchandise from them and CERTAINLY no way I would ever recommend that ANYONE do the same, ever. Paying a little extra for convenience is one thing+, but this "deal" seems to clearly be aimed at only the most obtuse coffee drinkers, or simply and plainly, the most unfortunate and stupid of people.<br /><br />If you're interested in getting them delivered, look up Wal-Mart online. They deliver @ $30.00 for 3 (yes three) 33oz containers. Which is still a bit high, but a far cry from this kind of internet superhighway robbery!

review/summary: Comparing Kraft's 'Deluxe' mac & cheese dinners
review/text: Amazon sells four Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe dinners. They're all pretty good. Each uses packets of cheese sauce, not packets of powder, so the cheese is never clumpy and distributes itself evenly. My husband, teenage daughter and I cooked up all four and did our own taste test. Here's what we found:<br /><br />The Original Cheddar flavor (Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)) is good. Plenty creamy, it tastes like a homemade version of the Kraft standard (i.e., <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVRK">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Scooby Doo Shapes, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 24)</a>).<br /><br />This one, the Sharp Cheddar flavor, is slightly tastier, and has a subtle smoky aftertaste.<br /><br />The light meal (Kraft Deluxe Macaroni & Cheese Dinner - Light, 14 oz) is pretty good, but when you try it side-by-side with the original flavor you can tell it's not as rich. Still, if you only buy this one you'll be happy. If you're counting calories go for it.<br /><br />The Four Cheese meal (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1FZ4Q">Kraft Macaroni & Cheese Deluxe Dinner, Four Cheese Sauce, 14-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>) is, in our opinion, the best. With the most cheese flavor, it combines American, cheddar, colby and parmesan, and tastes similar to what you'd find at a decent restaurant. The parmesan flavor is especially noticeable.<br /><br />These Deluxe dinners cost about twice as much as the basic Kraft boxes, but in each case you can really taste the difference.

review/summary: Doesn't taste good
review/text: No one in my family likes the taste of the cheese in this particular Deluxe brand of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese.  We thought it would taste like or better than the original but it does not.  It has a very strange taste that we found inedible.  Better to buy one box first before buying this 12-pack only to find out you don't like it.

review/summary: More mac & cheese please.
review/text: I love mac & cheese but haven't been able to eat the stuff with powder as it causes diarrhea every time I try & eat some. So it was with great aprehension that I tried this. Oh boy! Now I can enjoy mac & cheese again. The liquid cheese sauce is great with good flavor. So happy! Really good.

review/text: Every grocery store I know of stopped selling the Sharp Cheddar flavor of Kraft Deluxe Mac & Cheese... The sharp cheddar flavor is superior to all other flavors... Thank god I just renewed my Amazon prime membership! This is the best mac & cheese known to man. Seriously.

review/summary: Not good
review/text: I grew up on Kraft Mac N Cheese in the blue box, and still love it.  My kids love it too.  When I picked up a box of "Deluxe", I had only the highest expectations.<br /><br />It starts out the same, cooking the dried noodles in boiling salted water.  Then you add the packet of cheese sauce, and things go downhill from there.  First of all, the cheese is like the kind you get from the convenience store for your nachos, and not the good ones either.  It seems like hot liquid plastic that glows orange.  The taste is somewhat bitter, artificial and chemical like.  My kids took one bite and said, "Eew!"  I thought they were overreacting, because, how bad could something I've enjoyed in the blue box be... especially the deluxe version.<br /><br />In the end, we ended up throwing the whole batch out.  Still love the original, but won't be buying the deluxe again.

review/summary: Good after school snack.
review/text: My kids love this snack. They can prepare it without problem.<br /><br />It should be healthier than other common snacks. Less worry.<br /><br />The macaroni is thinner than other Kraft packages, which is a plus.

review/summary: You'll love this if you love macaroni and cheese
review/text: Being Kraft how could it be bad? Very delicious and easy to prepare . . . just squeeze out the cheese like toothpaste. No need to add butter or milk, so quite convenient and fast. The cheese product itself tastes a lot like Velveeta when eaten straight, so don't let the word 'sharp cheddar' make you think it's anything near bitter. And why would you eat it straight? Because there's always that little bit left you can't quite squeeze out, to lap up like licking the spoon, and yum!
