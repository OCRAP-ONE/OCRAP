review/summary: Not for weight management.  Maybe for diabetics?
review/text: At 230 calories per bar (with 8g of fat - 12% of DV) you may "think Thin" all you want,  it's just not gonna happen.  Perhaps this is something good for diabetics though,  since it's sweetened with sugar alcohols and not real sugar.<br /><br />It definitely has a weird taste as well.  I noticed it right away,  and it lingers in your mouth.  Sadly,  the whole box is going to end up in the garbage.  At least it was an Amazon Lightning Deal so I didn't pay much.

review/summary: Amazon Disappoints
review/text: I have been a big fan of Amazon for a long time now, and I buy A LOT of stuff from them. One item I have purchased almost monthly over the past year is the "think Thin" Brownie Crunch protein bar. That all ended this month. When I attempted to place my order, I was not allowed to complete my purchase. The message I received read: " We are sorry. This item has limited purchase quantity. Because you have purchased the maximum allowable quantity in the past you cannot buy any more units of this item." Wow! It is hard to imagine a purchase limit on protein bars, but apparently there is one, although I have yet to find that information on the site. What makes this an even more ridiculous proposition is the fact that there is a subscription option that allows one to receive "think Thin" bars monthly on an auto-ship program for, I presume, perpetuity if one so chooses. I would be fine with signing up for a subscription, but Amazon won't let me do that either for the same reason. Apparently Amazon customer service does not share my sense of irony when I pointed out the subscription option, and they simply repeated: "It is a limited item. Sorry for the inconvenience."<br /><br />I have been very happy with Amazon's service up until today. Maybe it is because I have high expectations based on my many, many previous transactions, or maybe it is because my wholly unsatisfying interaction with Amazon customer service, but this episode leaves a very bitter taste in my mouth. Although I will likely continue to purchase from Amazon, I believe I will make it a point to patronize my local merchants whenever possible before I consider another Amazon purchase.<br /><br />I love this "think Thin" product, but buyers beware of Amazon's policy.

review/summary: Works great in morning smoothies!
review/text: I bought a 16-ounce bag of Bob's Red Mill Organic Golden Flaxseed Meal a few months ago and have been using it ever since. I have heard that you shouldn't keep it that long once you open it, but I haven't noticed any problems. The bag says "keeps best refrigerated or frozen," and I keep it in the refrigerator. I add about a tablespoon of the flaxseed meal to a ~16-ounce smoothie I blend fresh every morning, and I love it for that purpose! It doesn't really add any flavor that I've noticed, but I do believe it makes my pumpkin smoothies taste more like pumpkin PIE smoothies (I guess the flaxseed meal taste and texture reminds me of a pie crust being crumbled into the mix). I used more flaxseed meal in my smoothies a few times when the bag tipped out more than I was expecting, and it just made the smoothie thicker than I intended (not a big deal). The blender I use is a cheap single-serve blender, so it doesn't grind the meal up very much more than the original product straight out of the bag, but the texture doesn't bother me. The texture is not a fine powder like flour, nor is it sand-like as with cornmeal...it's flaky. I do have to wash my cup out within a few hours of finishing my smoothie, or the meal flakes will stick to the sides and make handwashing difficult.<br />I have used it once as an egg substitute in a box cake recipe (for each egg, use 1 tablespoon flaxseed meal and 3 tablespoons of water; stir and let sit for about five minutes to get a bit gummy). Though the cake turned out okay, I'd probably not use it that way again. The cake density was a bit off, and my husband didn't like finding little flakes of flaxseed meal in his cake. He is fine with it in his smoothies, though.

review/text: I was trying to make cake pops that look like watermelons (red on the inside with chocolate sprinkles and then green coating) so I wanted the cake to taste like watermelon. This worked PERFECT. It's not overwhelming, I mixed it with a gluten free cake mix because I have several coworkers with celiac, it was great. Decently priced (I couldn't find watermelon extract elsewhere so maybe I'm wrong) and super convenient.

review/summary: Yumm...doctor a little bit and it's like restaurant Spanish rice...
review/text: It's almost embarrassing in these 'fresh food' days to laud a 'processed' product, but I verge on being a gourmet cook and really love the stuff. I use decent brands of the newer 'petite' diced tomatoes & add half a cup frozen corn just before the tomatoes and water. Also, I think there's too much water in the instructions--with the liquid in the tomatoes I think only 1 1/4 cups water is enough, not 1 3/4. Next time I may add a small can of mild green chilis and 1/2 t. extra chili powder.<br /><br />By the way, using a large nonstick pan allows better browning of the rice/vermicelli mixture. At end of sautee stage I turn the heat up for 15 seconds or so to make it extra crispy on the bottom before adding corn, tomatoes & water.

review/text: These are a little disappointing.  The cherry flavor is nowhere near as strong as in the standard Haribo Gummibear which I subscribe to on a regular basis.  The aroma is stronger than the taste.  These feel harder, too, and are huge in the mouth to begin with.  The cherries in the bag just sort of stick together like one big ball of red and green rubber.  Bummer.  Hate to see what these look like in the summertime.<br /><br />I'm sucking on one right now and it feels like a bland rubber blob is in my mouth.  You can't be inconspicuous eating one of these!  I won't be getting these again.

review/text: Ahhh the Haribo Gummi Cherry. I discovered these guys in small bags being sold in specialty candy shops and import food stores. Upon tasting them for the first time, I was hooked. Not too sweet, with an almost delicate sour taste that mimics real cherries pretty darn well, these things are deceptively addictive! It takes a great deal of self control not to snarf the whole bag by yourself!<br /><br />A neat thing I discovered actually that makes them even better is to put them in your refrigerator or freeze them for about 10-20 minutes just so they're nice and chilled. The gummi will harden a fair amount and that makes them a really nice cool, chewy treat!<br /><br />Overall, a fantastic, severely addicting candy. 5lbs will not last long!

review/text: I love these cherries!! Like a previous user already said, you can usually only find them in candy stores in the mall, and they're incredibly expensive.  We're talking like $8.99/lb.  But with these, you're getting a 5-lb. bag for $15...$3/lb!  These are some of my favorite gummy candies of all time and I'll continue to order them as long as they're available.

review/text: I first had this candy as a young soldier stationed in german in 1980 and was hooked, over the years I have paid as much as $5.00 a pound for this product if and when I could fine it.  Since finding it on Amazon I have been able to buy these great Candy Cherries at what I think is a great price, they are always fresh, and the best thing is they always have the same flavor no matter if made in Spain or Turkey

review/text: I first had these delicious gummies in Germany. They are called Happy Cherries over there but they are the same thing. Anyway, just as good as I remember. 5lbs is a lot though so if you have yet to try them perhaps try a smaller size and then you'll fall in love and order this behemoth. I ended up getting 10lbs to qualify for the free shipping so I guess that's why I feel like I have so much (because I do.) Totally worth it and now I have a hefty supply. It's honestly way too many but I figure I'll eat them all eventually. I was worried about them shipping and arriving stuck together or something but they are fantastic.

review/summary: Cute Shaped Gummies
review/text: The 5 pounder is the best deal to get as much gummies you want.  Each gummy looks like the cherries you get from the casino slot. They are much bigger than the classic bear shaped (probably 3 to 4 times). Just like their gummy bear counterpart, it is not too sticky that it glues your teeth. Not too sweet neither. Just the right combination of flavors to taste. It may be a bit too rubbery to some; but I like it that way.<br /><br />From Haribo, the biggest gummy bear manufacturer in the world (based in Germany).

review/summary: Had a Waxy Chemical Flavor
review/text: I've been eating Haribo Gummi for years and especially love the Tiwn Cherry gummi. Imagine my delight when I bought two bags of Haribo gummi candies, the Twin Strawberries and Twin Cherries. However, when I got these bags of candies, there was an overwhelming smell of wax and chemicals that just turned my stomach. Not only did my hands stink of this horrible chemical smell, but the candy didn't taste very good. As a result of this horrible cloying chemical smell, I ended up throwing 3/4 of these bags away.  The large sized bags also did not have the same flavor or texture as the smaller bags of Haribo. I wouldn't recommend this product to my worse enemy.

review/summary: Surprisingly good!
review/text: I have recently got on a health kick - if I had a salad in the past, I would use bacos or even fry up some real bacon without a thought.  I heard some of the chemicals in Bacos are really bad for you - but a salad without some kind of bacon just wasn't enticing to us, so I tried this since we're now trying to eat salad every day at dinner.<br /><br />I was almost afraid to use it - the color isn't like bacos at all, it's lighter...and we are far from being vegetarians.  But it really added bacon flavor to the salad - so much so I can give up the bacon and bacos.  It's not as crunchy and hard as bacos - but they definitely add enough crunchy consistency.  My husband says they are ok, he'd rather have real bacon (even over bacos - he always said bacos were just 'ok' too) - but he likes them.  This will now become a staple in our house!

I haven't eaten pork in about 20 yrs but have been eating Bac-Os and occasionally the fake bacon strips from Morningstar Farms or their breakfast patties...those I like but wanted to switch to something without artificial ingredients,coloring and preservatives etc. I MUCH prefer the flavor of Betty Crocker's Bac-Os, hands down it tastes SO much better. I honestly can't stomach the flavor of this brand! I guess I'll just have to cut them all out. I would rather go without than eat the Bac'Uns.

review/summary: Great substitute for homemade...little sweet
review/text: I bought this for my son's birthday cake because I didn't have time to make icing from scratch.  I will a bit skeptical because I have never used bought icing before besides Betty Crocker, and I particularly do not like icing in general.  This covered his multilayered cake well.  It also made a great buttercream icing frozen transfer.  If you have a dry climate just make sure you don't leave it sitting to long or it will start to harden.  I put it in the fridge after I was done so that the transfer wouldn't get soft.  It was a bit on the sweet side for me, almost too sweet.  If I do eat frosting it tends to be whipped, so please take that into consideration.  I have lots leftover which is fine because it allows me to work on my decorating skills, and the price was great.  Overall I would buy it again.

review/text: Hamburger Helper has a lot of varietes in our local supermarkets, mostly pasta and noodles mixtures. Lately also some with Asian Rice, which are very good. But I've never found one with potatoes and was surprised to discover "Potatoes Stroganoff" on Amazon. I ordered a 12 pack and it arrived today. Of course, I had to make it for dinner (always like to try something new), and all I can say is: it was delicious! I added some button mushrooms to the potatoes and sauce and served a green salad on the side. My family loved it! A neighbor dropped by and had to have "just a little taste" of what was left in the pan. She couldn't believe how good it tasted so I gave her a box and she can't wait to make it for tomorrow night. Great product!

I also used one of my $25 Chase/Amazon card gift rewards, so all  that yummy food cost me only $3.11.<br /><br />I should have checked Amazon.com first. It would have saved me lots of aggravation.

review/summary: Good but not impressive
review/text: Bought this at Ralphs, 1 for $4.49 to try and was unimpressed. The high protein is great, but you can find that in other grocery store products. The high fiber is great for diets, and you can't find this high in any other pasta, but it tastes and is the texture like macaroni for kids. It definitely tastes and feels better than some "healthy" pastas available, but I'm just not sold on this. If you want low net carbs and that's your main goal, definitely use this and add in meats, veggies, and cheese to your dish for a good meal.

review/summary: Tastes great...
review/text: This pasta tastes amazingly good for being low carb. I bet you won't be able to tell the difference between normal pasta and this. Great for dieting or diabetic patients that wish to enjoy a "carby" tasting pasta meal. The only downside is the high price tag. If your health calls for it though, you won't regret it. It is truly pleasantly tasting.

review/summary: Arrowhead Mills Organic Popcorn
review/text: This popcorn is so great, fresh, and pops easily. ~~Popcorn is one of the worst when it comes to pesticides, so choosing organic is the only way to go. ~~We also use the stainless steel popper and everytime we make this popcorn for a new guest they say they never want to go back to the old style of popcorn or the bags... The flavor of the popcorn when cooked with organic olive oil is also a wonderful flavorable plus when popping this popcorn and the only oil that we use right now...

review/summary: AWESOME ON THE GRILL - Need to order more now, or a recipe!
review/text: I was given Omaha Steaks Marinated Salmon Fillets #1417 4pcs/6oz as a gift.  I grilled these indirectly over high heat for just over 4 minutes per side exactly and was TOTALLY blown away by just how good they were.  I was not a Salmon fan at all and never ordered Salmon when dining out.  I now may have to alter that theory when we go out for fine dining to try to compare those events against this item.  Awesome on the grill!  Moist and very flavorful.  I would please ask someone to please invent or advise a copy-cat recipe that attempts to mimic this product since it could get pricey to buy these often otherwise!  BUT OH SO GOOD in my opinion!  Hope you agree.<br /><br />Here is the ingredient deck:<br />Atlantic Salmon, Marinade(Canola Oil, Olive Oil, water, salt, spices, dehydrated garlic, paprika, dehydrated onion, dehydrated red bell pepper, autolyzed yeast extract, natural grill flavor, natural smoke flavor, citric acid, and natural flavor), color added.<br /><br />I posted a picture showing the nutrition facts and recommended preparation methods too.<br /><br />Take care.

review/summary: Please offer this year-round through Subscribe & Save!
review/text: This tea is delicious either hot or cold. Its aroma is so rich and soothing that it would be worth brewing even if you didn't drink it.<br /><br />So many of us want this year-round that I wish Amazon would make it available through Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />If only Celestial Seasonings would ALSO make a decaff version of this tea, I could enjoy it in the evening as well. (I'm super-sensitive to caffeine). But at least this "regular" version is a great start to my day.<br /><br />Since I sometimes have trouble finding Nutcracker Sweet at a reasonable price, I occasionally "stretch" it by brewing it thus: 1 bag of Nutcracker Sweet + 1 bag of PG Tips + 3 cups of boiling water. The two teas complement each other very nicely.<br /><br />When it's iced, sweetened with Xylitol (which dissolves best while the tea is still warm), and laced with a bit of milk or Half & Half, it satisfies me more than most desserts. I even know some people who add a drop of Irish Cream....

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I am disappointed in this product.  I had expected something with more flavor considering the description note: "its hearty and rich full flavor."<br /><br />I prepare several dishes with Guinness Stout and even a small amount will produce a flavor that is unmistakable.  The amount of stout in this recipe must be a small fraction because I could not detect it at all and certainly no hint of Worcestershire Sauce, which usually makes its presence known in dishes such as this.<br /><br />For me it was much too bland and had a "pasty" flavor I associate with undercooked wheat flour thickening.

review/summary: Yummy But Where is the Beef?
review/text: I bought this out of curiosity and was pleasantly surprised that the flavor was as good as at my favorite Irish pub.  Alas, when I poured the contents into a pan to warm it up, I noticed there were lots of potato and carrot slices... lots of rich broth/ gravy but. only two wee pieces of beef smaller than sugar cubes.  It was funny, as the can is quite large.<br /><br />I can recommend it based on the flavor- but expect to "BYO beef" if you are going to feed family or friends or you'll just be serving them a Guiness flavored 'soup'.<br /><br />(For any non cooks or lazy folks out there- Omaha Steaks pot roast could work well!)

review/summary: Easily amongst the best stews in a can
review/text: It's almost as if you visited someones grandparent in Ireland and had this to eat. The kind of thing that is homemade but couldn't be pulled off unless skilled at doing so. Perhaps you could think of it as a small batch stew you take home and have ready for special occasions when most things available don't seem good enough to eat.<br /><br />This might be more akin to taking the leftovers from a stew dish, though without much of the greasiness that comes with it. Just the right sweetness and combination of red wine and Guinness, herbs, meat and vegetables, etc. It's practically homemade except for the hydrolyzed ingredients that line it's contents (which is where they do appear to have research and testing from a modern food science perspective.<br /><br />I plan to try the Tavern stew as well. The Haggis they make is good though I consider the stew to be of more interest to me now. It's probably better to buy from their website directly because they sell it cheaper, even though you have to pay additional for shipping; it was much faster processing even though Amazon is fast.
