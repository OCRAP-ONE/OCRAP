review/summary: The best Indian Sauces ever!
review/text: I've tried every Indian sauce on the market and this is by far the best. Hands down. The difference is really in the ingredients. The others I've had have been like 50% filler - where is this all natural with tons of flavor. Great product - is on our menu at home several times a month. Highly recommended.

review/summary: The real deal
review/text: I was lucky enough to be on the taste testing team for this product and let me tell you, it's pretty darn tasty.  I'm a huge Indian cuisine fan and I've tried a lot of the grocery store sauces and kits.  Spicy Nothings only has 3 flavors right now, but all 3 are spot on!  You owe it to yourself to try this sauce if you're into Indian food.  They have some distribution at specialty stores, too.  So if you want to dodge the shipping, look for it at a few places around San Diego:<br /><br />Whole Foods (La Jolla)<br />Jimbo's (Del Mar, Carlsbad, Escondido, 4S Ranch)<br />Keil's (Clairemont Blvd)<br />Windmill Farms (Del Cerro Blvd)<br />Cardiff Seaside Market

review/text: The spicy and tangy curry was fantastic.  It has a great balance of flavors and doesn't need anything added to it. Just pour over whatever you've stir-fried and it's wonderful.  I tend to like a "medium" spiciness with full flavor and that's exactly what this is.  It makes for a great quick and easy meal that's very tasty and healthy.

review/summary: Best prepared Indian-style sauce ever!
review/text: Tried this as a sample once and was hooked! This is the best Indian-style prepared sauce I have ever tried -- I have tried many and was always disappointed -- this one really delivers. I eat it with naan, with rice, on meat, as a dip for pita bread, or whatever I'm having at the moment. I have it on the table like some people have ketchup; if what I've cooked up comes out bland, I just add a little sauce to my plate.<br />My favorite flavor is the spicy and tangy (vindaloo). It does have a bit of a kick- which I love -- but if you don't like that, you can ask the manufacturer which flavors are less hot. I like that this product is all natural. I tend to pick the flavors that are lowest in saturated fat. I'm American and I love Indian food and this is the only palatable Indian-style prepared sauce I have ever found. I'm addicted.

review/summary: Stash Earl Grey Is The Cream of the Crop
review/text: I could not disagree more with the previous reviewer.  Stash Earl Grey tea is my gold standard.  I've regularly used many different brands -- including some of the "subtle" kinds that the previous reviewer favors -- and nothing compares with the bloom and fragrance of the Stash.  The others are either too "orangey" or too tepid (although much more expensive).  If Earl Grey tea is worth drinking over the many weak-flavored imitations and other black teas out there, then Stash is the only choice.  I've used it for more than 20 years, and I always keep coming back to it after flirting with other teas, because it is of the highest quality and consistency at the most reasonable price.  Five stars for Stash!!

review/summary: Overwhelming Bergamot Perfume
review/text: ***<br />This Earl Grey Tea from Stash is plain, and definitely not subtle because of a strong bergamot component---way too strong! If you really, really love bergamot you may like it, but I much prefer a more subtle and more complex tea. It tastes like perfumed black tea; I could hardly drink it. I could not tell the difference between it and Stash's Double Bergamot Black Tea---both are just swimming in oil of bergamot. I am an Earl Grey fan, but just couldn't stomach this tea.<br /><br />It seems like the quality of the black tea is very good, though, because even with a longer brewing time, the tea did not become bitter...so, if you can stand being hit over the head with the bergamot flavor, you might enjoy it.<br /><br />Only recommended for those who want a strongly perfumed bergamot Earl Grey.<br />***

review/text: What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the "worst" of "simple sugars", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and "Caramel", are similar, but "Maca" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.

review/text: At first we thought the bar was damaged by heat... or was too old (despite exp. date saying otherwise). A few months later we bought it again (from a different store) - same problem. And now (especially since another reviewer had the same problem) I think this MACA bar is designed to be like that. It's NOT chocolaty. It tastes and looks like something else. It may satisfy a sweet tooth, but it's not worth the price. Their other 3 flavors taste fabulous (Acai, Goji, "Caramel"). Not the healthiest though, due to some added sugar.

review/summary: Beware!
review/text: This was an impulse buy while standing in line at an organic foods market. First off, I have to say that I've had raw chocolate before, and I really like dark chocolate. So after a surprising cost of $5 I was hoping for the best tasting sweet to ever hit me in the mouth. Wow, I just have to say that this was so awful that I feel like I have to warn the world. I was a little disappointed in the small size of it at first, but now I understand that no one could stand to eat one of these if they were full sized. For one, the "caramel" is an unflavored paste-like substance  , and the only way I can describe the whole eating experience is by likening it to having a pill get stuck in the back of your throat and being stuck with that rancid flavor until you manage to eat something less horrible. As I sit here in my buyers remorse stupor, I can't stop thinking about the many more pleasing things I could have done with my $5. For instance, I could go bowling, tip a stripper, wash my car, or buy 2 or 3 less disgusting chocolate bars. I'm only righting this review in the hopes that I may keep some other poor unsuspecting shopper from being duped as I was.

The Indian recipes have always been my favorite, and as I ran out of the Masala Chai my daughter brought me back from India I began looking for a rich replacement.  In the end I came to these Amazon reviews and offerings, and ultimately ordered the Wagh Bakri bags.<br /><br />Their chai is, in my opinion, mediocre at best.  Heavily colored, with strong black tea but less of the spice recipe that makes chai a delicious adventure.  It is certainly not "India's Best Tea", and I won't be ordering this item again.

review/summary: For Spicy Food Lovers
review/text: A very good, but extremely spicy, pickled sausage for those who prefer their food on the 'hotter' side.  The texture isn't as delicate as most pickled sausages I've come across, and seems to be less 'mushy' than most, with a firm, but tender texture to the meat, which I like.  I've eaten these little delicacies several times and have been rather pleased with the product during all occasions.  Really the only after-effect is that you feel as if you were ****ing out a supernova the next morning.

review/summary: Delicious!!!!
review/text: This sausage was awesome. I remember eating the original kind when I was a kid. The Tijuana version is spicier. They taste great and don't at all seem odd in the meat. I recommend these to people who like pickled and sour stuff and even sausages in general. They aren't really healthy though. Don't eat this stuff everyday, just like how you won't eat fast food everyday; same concept.<br /><br />You can find these at gas stations in the beef jerky section. They are 1.25 a piece. I've found these in gas stations in Michigan and Texas, so I think they are pretty spread out in the states.<br /><br />But remember, don't eat this daily, I also wouldn't recommend eating more than one sausage a day if you have a weak stomach. This stuff isn't the healthiest things to eat. They just make a great snack once in a while.

review/summary: Multiples for real heat
review/text: These are exquisite. As others have mentioned, they are quite possibly the best picked sausage on the market. They are still sold in some California stores but are becoming almost impossible to find. I started buying all that I could find, due to their increasing rarity.  Their heat is perfect. One is not too hot, and the taste is great. Taste's better quality meat than the slushy types. It doesn't taste "mushy". That's a big plus. If you want real heat, eat multiples. Three or four of these will leave your mouth burning, and some level of regret the next day, but individually, always worth it and a great snack.  I've just added them to my wish list, so I can always find them in future. :D

review/summary: One of the best snacks to go with your beer.
review/text: Every now and then I want to have a pickled sausage with my beer. There aren't really a lot of options, but my grocery store does have a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />What gives this an edge over many pickled sausages I've had over the years is the heat. When someone says something is spicy, it's usually different for each person. I do eat a lot of spicy food, so usually it's not until the end of the sausage where I can really feel a little heat.<br /><br />I usually buy two for this reason, and also add that I'm always washing this down with beer between every couple of bites, it's probably even more spicy to eat it straight. This item is really a classic to me. Growing up; even as a kid I liked pickled sausage. I remember a brand(Not by name) that actually had beef hearts listed in the ingredients. =) All of these sausages probably have beef hearts, but it's wise to not let us know because some people get grossed out.<br /><br />If you're looking for a fantastic treat to go with your beer, this is one that sticks out for me. 5 stars without a doubt.

Im tooscared to buy the big jars I see in the grocery store that look like these cause in the jar it looks gross lol. During a lunch break with one of my coworkers I grabbed 3 or 4 tijuanas & when we got back to work I started munching on one & everyone was looking at me laughing with their noses turned up but my girl was willing to try one & she LOVED it!! Every now & then she would even stop & buy me one on her way to work. So glad I could turn someone on to these. Didn't mean to write a book but I'm so glad I don't have to grab 3 at a time at different gas stations anymore. Will be ordering asap!!

review/text: Recommend putting less water. If you fill it to the line like noodles, it comes out like soup. The mixture isn't thickening enough.  So I would say put less water when cooking them.  The flavor was lacking a bit, but I think that's because I put the recommended amount of water. I think when I put less water it will be more flavorful (less diluted).

review/summary: The King of Teas.
review/text: Unquestionably the most refined of teas, Darjeeling comes from a region in the Indian (West Bengalese) Himalayas close to the Nepalese border, 7000 ft above sea level. Originating with the small-time, private, mid-19th century plantations of a British civil surgeon named Dr. Campbell, tea has long since transformed the region into a major economic center, with over 80 running gardens producing over 10 million kgs (over 22 million lbs) of tea on a total area of almost 20,000 hectares (approximately 75 square miles), and employing over 50,000 people on a permanent basis, with a further 15,000 being hired during the plucking season (March - November). The area's natural climate with its mixture of rainfall, sunshine and rich soil makes for a very distinctive flavor, and to be called "Darjeeling," tea *must* have been grown *and* processed in that particular region.<br /><br />Darjeeling tea comes in several harvest varieties or "flushes": the lighter Easter harvest or first flush, and the stronger Spring harvest or second flush, which has an unmistakeably fruity, Muscatel-like note. (There is also a Summer harvest or third flush, which is even stronger than the tea from the second harvest, but it is somewhat less refined and therefore less popular than the first two varieties.) Twinings' variety is a second flush tea with a subtle, quintessentially Darjeeling perfume; a great introduction to this region's exquisite teas that will hopefully make you curious for more.

review/text: One of my favorite stores has carried Twinings Darjeeling Tea in loose leaf form for years. Suddenly it has disappeared from all stores.  The product is great. Tea bags are every where, but loose leaf is difficult to find.  The only problem with the tea from Amazon is that the shipping charges are about the same price as the tea.

review/summary: Good value and fun introduction to the 'champagne of teas'
review/text: Twinings is known for delivering consistency and value. This tea is no exception.<br /><br />Most of the Twinings Darjeeling blend is black, but you can spot some green particles. The Twinings loose tea has no uncut leaves. The blend uses smaller, less-expensive particles which infuse more quickly than whole leaves.<br /><br />The Twinings tea has enough tannins to tolerate milk or a sweetener. It has some harshness when infusing is done at too high a temperature or for too long.<br /><br />If you drink tea without additions, I suggest steeping not more than 2.5 to 3 minutes to control bitterness. You may even want to check every 15 seconds starting at two minutes, since Darjeeling can quickly 'bolt' to a point of unpleasant sharpness. To avoid particulate matter in your drink, use a strainer or infuser with a fine mesh. (Amazon sells Tovolo, Teeli, and Frieling/Swissgold filters with very small openings in their screens.)<br /><br />To gain the best flavor, I recommend brewing at a temperature of 185F or cooler. (A clean candy or meat thermometer can quickly guide your efforts.) If you have been brewing with water that is near boiling, you will be shocked by the huge transformation from using water that cools a couple minutes after reaching the boiling point.<br /><br />I have enjoyed quality Darjeeling, the 'champagne of teas,' for over three decades. And, how do I rate Twinings? A bargain. If your enjoy Twinings, I suggest trying some other Darjeeling teas, perhaps estate grown. The better Darjeeling teas come from the higher elevations where the cooler mountain environment slows leaf growth and develops a fine flavor. Where should you search? Check reviews at Amazon and other sellers. Among the packaged brands, I love Peets - normally known for their coffees.<br /><br />Twinings is a bargain and a fine introduction to the wide range of Darjeeling teas.

review/summary: A great Darjeeling from Twining
review/text: Twining has a distinguished line of fine teas. This Darjeeling is one of Twining's best. Darjeeling is a fragrant tea variety with a refreshing but not overpowering tea flavor. Twining's version has no off tastes or after tastes -- just good old fashioned Darjeeling. It brews well a cup at a time, but is also fine in a pot. It brews well over a fairly wide range of steeping times also.<br /><br />You can buy this tea either in bags or in bulk loose tea. I strongly recommend the latter, as loose tea gives you so much more flexibility in amount and strength of your brewing. However, I can attest that I find absolutely no off flavors from the bags. So if you are on the go, by all means, carry a few bags with you in a plastic bag or other sealed pouch.<br /><br />You can pay more for a good Darjeeling, but you will be hard pressed to find a better Darjeeling at a lower price than this Twining.

review/text: I am a Trident Original gal.  Have been since my youth.  Oh sure, I strayed into Extra territory, and who can forget the "Bubble Yum" years?  (Red Dye Number 2 anyone?  I know, you are too young.  Whatever.)<br /><br />I always returned to my Trident Original. It tastes good, the flavor lasts, it's the right size.  But this is not Trident Original.  This is fancy pants Trident Vitality "Awaken."<br /><br />Trident lets you know it's fancy by excessively packaging it.  It's a lot of paper and plastic for 9 pieces of gum, so I dropped it a star for that.<br /><br />The gum is nicely flavored.  I do like the texture aspect when biting into a crunchy outer coating, and getting into the soft center.  The flavor lasts a long, long time.  (I'm pretty sure that's another gum's motto - Hubba Bubba as it turns out.)<br /><br />I chewed for 45 minutes.  At first it's a pretty soft chew, but the gum firms up as time goes on.  By the time I was ready to spit it out, the flavor was still there but my jaw was sore.  I'm sure there's a joke in there somewhere.<br /><br />It's a nice gum, but nothing I would throw over my Trident Original for, and the packaging would give me pause anyway.  Though, I will say that one benefit of the packaging means that it is impossible for the gum to fall out of the pack and get purse debris stuck to it, so that's a nice feature, but heck ... what's a little sand and tobacco stuck to your gum?  It gives it character.

review/text: Trident Vitality packs have only 9 pieces of gum per pack, as opposed to the similar Orbit White or Dentyne Ice's 12 pieces. However, I usually chew 2 pieces of the Orbit or Dentyne where I only need 1 piece of the Trident as the pieces are larger. The length of time that Trident lasts is comparable to Dentyne and Orbit, if not better. The gum itself has the same hard outer shell, but the inside is softer than the other two which makes it less "annoying" to begin chewing. The flavor is similar to the above mentioned gums and I have no complaints about this brand.

review/summary: Very Pepperminty & Long Lasting
review/text: Trident Vitality Awaken is a long lasting sugar free gum, shaped similar to Chiclets gum, that has a very strong peppermint taste with a slight after taste that I associate with food/candy that is sugar free. The after taste is not very noticeable for me but my husband who can't stand anything "diet" doesn't really care for this gum. Most gums I've chewed usually doesn't last long in flavor since I have a tendency to stuck the flavor out while chewing, within 5 minutes or so, but I found this one lasts much, much longer while remaining soft and not becoming hard to chew after chewing for awhile.<br /><br />I like the fresh feeling this gum gives me, like I'd just brushed my teeth, leaving my mouth feeling clean and minty. This gum will definitely do in a pinch when in need of fresh breath and your caught without your toothbrush. Another plus, it also helps with dry mouth which attributes to bad breath.<br /><br />As for the "Vitality" part of the gum, I felt the same while the chewing gum and after chewing it, not anymore alert than I usually am. Also, the ginseng in the gum is not noticeable in the flavor.<br /><br />For those who need to know, the package states:<br />Allergy information: Contains Soy.<br />Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine.

review/summary: Not bad... but not very good ~
review/text: I consistently chew gum after eating to freshen my breath (especially after lunch breaks from work or if out and about in town).  I have tried virtually every sugarless gum on the market and have settled on Orbit Peppermint as the best available for long lasting flavor and fresh breath as well as non-stickiness (read on).<br /><br />Trident Vitality is a good effort (I had the ginseng (awake) version delivered).  I appreciate that they are attempting to add some pizazz to the gum.  They are the hard shell gum similar to Eclipse.  My problems are thus:<br /><br />~The flavor is short and unexciting.<br />~Does not really freshen breath (stick to Orbit or suck an Altoid - both work better)<br />~The packaging does little to ease removing gum (you have to pull the foil packet out of the cardboard and pop a piece out - plus the cardboard packing does not like to re-close).<br />~The gum is rather sticky, I have a permanent retainer and it does like to stick to it.  Not a problem if you don't have dental work!<br />~There is little benefit to the small amount of ginseng in the gum - it is more marketing than anything.<br />~You have to have the whole pack on you unless you cut a piece with the foil to take with you. (Orbit has those individually wrapped pieces).<br /><br />It is not nearly as bad as some of the sugarless gums out there, but skip this one and go for Orbit or Stride.

I'd also recommend trying some of the other Vitality flavors. They've got a vanilla mint that's particularly soft and lovely.

review/text: This is a very good gum with a snappy taste.  I'm surprised it can't be found in the local supermarket.  This is a pillow type gum rather than stick.  With this type of gum I usually pop 2 into my mouth because they're small.  This gum is very large as only requires 1 piece.  They stay soft and chewy for a long time.  I'll likely reorder this gum because I'm an avid gum chewer.

review/summary: Somewhat Expensive, but Possibly Well Worth It.
review/text: I seldom chew gum. Almost never. However, I've been on a few long  driving trips with my wife and I felt myself getting drowsy. I noted such to my wife so as to warn her. She asked if I'd like a stick of gum. She said it helped you to keep alert. Hmmmm. I'd never heard of that. Well, I tried it and chewing gum worked remarkably well for that task. It makes good sense. Have you ever tried to chew gum and fall asleep at the same time? It just won't work.<br /><br />Well, the other day I was in our nearby grocery store and I spotted some Trident Vitality gum of a variety called Awaken. That sounded like just the thing to have in the glove compartment of the car. It's a real fresh, zesty, peppermint-flavored gum with added ginseng. Tastes real good. Plus, it's sugar free. It comes in little "pillows" rather than sticks and I'd probably have to chew a couple to get a good effect. It's somewhat expensive for chewing gum, but if it helps to keep me awake on the road, it's well worth it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: No ginseng taste, very sticky, a bit gimmicky
review/text: For whatever reason, I didn't realize this was the 'chicklet' style gum squares as opposed to stick gum.  Normally I wouldn't purchase this style of gum because the packaging seems wasteful for what you get product wise and because there's no wrapper left to spit your gum out in on the go (blister pack houses the gum pieces).<br /><br />That said, I think the box is pretty cool (the top 'clicks' when you open and close it) and the gum is tasty but sticky!  I could definitely see this as being problematic for anyone who has dental work, such as braces (though I suppose technically if you have braces, you shouldn't be chewing gum).<br /><br />As for the Vitality "Awaken" aspect of this gum, pure gimmick IMO.  Ginseng infused my tushy!  It seems to me they just put 'Ginseng' on the box to attract 'wellness seekers'.  There's absolutely no Ginseng flavor to this gum whatsoever and that doesn't surprise me, since it probably wouldn't suit most western palates.  If you want to know what Ginseng is 'supposed' to taste like, albeit sweetend, so you at least have an idea of what this gum 'doesn't' taste like - do a search for Lotte Ginseng Gum.  Haven't had it in years but that's the gum we chewed as kids in Korea for that real 'ginseng' taste when there weren't any honey soaked ginseng roots available for us to nosh on.<br /><br />That said, if someone were to offer me a piece of this gum, I wouldn't decline - but it's something I would pass by at the checkout counter.  I'll probably stick to my orbit or stride.

review/summary: Not a gum chewer, but this is tasty
review/text: I don't chew much gum, more of a hard candy person, but I did find these chiclets (candy coated gum) to have a nice flavor, not overpoweringly sweet or minty with a subtle herbal flavor. The flavor does last for a reasonable time, best guesstimate is around 30 minutes, at least that's the longest I was willing to chew on a piece.<br /><br />The gum is packaged in a flip top box with each individual gum separated in a blister pack sheet of 9. Aside from the taste did I notice any added benefit from the 'dash of ginseng,' not that I can tell. The amount in each piece of gum is fairly small based upon the location of Ginseng extract in the ingredient list, so I wouldn't expect this to be a substitute for any supplements people are taking (I'd rank it more in line with holistic medicine levels).<br /><br />Bottom line, I find the gum good, but not good enough for me to switch away from my hard candy habit.

review/text: I'm guessing spearmint is more popular, because it always seems harder to find peppermint, which I greatly prefer.<br /><br />Unlike many of the "how strong can we make it" gums and mints out there, this one doesn't try to dissolve your tongue. Instead, it has a nice, clean taste, that lasts a long time and fades off very evenly. Chances are, the gum taste will outlast you, unless you are the type that chews gum until it dies, no matter how long that takes.<br /><br />The "awaken" thing is marketing. In other words, don't expect this to actually wake you up like a cup of coffee. It won't.<br /><br />Sean P. Logue, 2011

review/summary: Good Gum
review/text: I like sugar free minty gum.  That's what this is.  The packaging is classy, cellophane wrapped box with 9 foil bubble wrapped pieces inside.  The piece size is a little larger than similar gum, I purchase. If you usually have 2 pieces, maybe one will be enough. Since I only have one piece that doesn't help with the cost, which is a little high. I would like this better in the non-individually wrapped canister. I keep that type in my car. I keep this in my desk and at home.<br /><br />I like the crunchy shell. The gum is kind of soft at first. Gradually it gets firmer. The minty taste really lasts.  It contains ginseng extract, but it must be a tiny amount. This is everything I want in a gum. I will get it again.

review/summary: Great Flavor, But Perhaps Not For Kids
review/text: I love the peppermint flavor of this gum.  I find that a piece lasts about 15 minutes before it has lost too much flavor to continue.  My sons, however, did not like the taste.  They described it as "too spicy" which for them means that the flavor is a little too intense.  I do find that the pieces are a little small for an adult mouth, though, so I have taken to popping two at a time.  As for the "energy" fron ginsing, et al, well, I would like to say that it is like a double espresso, but I really didn't notice any "energy" boost from this.  Nevertheless, it is a great tasting gum and worth it just for that.

review/summary: Great Gum!
review/text: I love to chew gum, but my biggest difficulty with gum is freshness. How well it stays fresh in the package and how long it stays fresh in my mouth are both big deals to me.<br /><br />Trident Vitality - at least the peppermint "Awaken" flavor - solves both problems.<br /><br />The coated style and blister packaging both seem to ensure that the gum maintains freshness while sitting on the store shelf or hanging out in a purse waiting to be needed. I have popped it into my mouth freshly bought and then another piece weeks later, and it tastes the same every time.<br /><br />The biggest surprise has been the long-lasting softness and flavor freshness. I will admit that I don't typically chew gum for more than about 45 minutes at a time before growing tired of it. But, it's primarily because most gums are well beyond their freshness limit by that time, and I hate to chew tough, flavorless gum. I have not been able to outchew this gum! I have grown tired of the persistent, fresh flavor long before it or the softness has even begun to fade.<br /><br />I mainly hold back from giving this gum five stars because of it's price. I will admit, though, that it's a price I'll tend to pay (at least for me - maybe not for handing out to the kids!) because it is such a good gum.<br /><br />The only other thing that could improve on the brand would be for Trident to put out a cinnamon version of Vitality!

review/text: I like the smell and taste of this gum.  The ginseng does awaken me a bit and gives me a fresh start to my day.  I tend to chew gum when outside walking to errands to keep my mouth moist since I live in a dry area.  My only critique is that the packaging is quite large for having only 9 pieces of gum inside and I have a pouch purse the pack barely fits in, so I have to take the inner tray out.  I wonder if there is a way for the company to use less packaging for this item.  I do like the design of it though.

review/summary: Awesome Gum...Just Don't Leave It In a Hot Car
review/text: Of all the gum I've chewed in the last few months Trident Vitality Awaken is one of my favourite. (The Reinvigorate flavour is pretty good, too, but is a better choice when you're craving something sweet rather than something minty.)<br /><br />The Trident Vitality Awaken has a great minty flavour that, for me, lasted approximately 20 minutes. Each piece is neither too large nor too small and is packaged individually in a little plastic cell, backed with foil, which I like because then I'm not left with a purse full of gum wrappers.<br /><br />There is, unfortunately, not much for me to say when reviewing this gum. It's really good gum with a strong mint flavour, just don't leave it in your car on a summer day or you'll find all your pieces of gum cracked with some of the insides oozing out :( I ruined one pack that way but have since learned my lesson and will carry this gum in my purse and not leave it in my car. Even with that I'd still buy this gum.

review/summary: Very good, but not for more than a few hours!
review/text: My husband is a marathon gum chewer.  He often chews the same piece of gum for up to 6 hours while at work.  He says that this gum has a nice texture.  It's good for blowing small bubbles and cracking them.  The flavor is good too, not too strong, but just right.  However, after about 3 or 4 hours the flavor and texture start to deteriorate and he has to switch to a new piece.<br /><br />Most people don't chew gum for that length of time anyway.  So this should be good for just about anyone.<br /><br />We got the Awaken kind, and we didn't really notice that it helps us keep awake long term.  But perhaps when you first put it in your mouth, the burst of flavor from the liquid center might wake you up just a little bit.<br /><br />We like it and will probably try it again.

review/summary: A yummy chewing gum with a little kick.
review/text: Trident Vitality Awaken (9 Count) chewing gun is a new product for those gum chewers looking for something refreshing and with a little bite.  "Energy" gum has been out for awhile (I've tried Jolt Gum around six years ago) with Rockstar coming out with their version a year ago.  But those gums are loaded with caffeine (enough as a cup a coffee) and the only thing they do is make your heart beat a little fast and are not very good when you're driving on long road trips (stick with plain old black coffee).  Trident's offering is a whole lot better tasting and I enjoyed the easy kick I received from it.<br /><br />The taste is very pleasant and the energy comes on gradually (not like a speeding bullet) and it doesn't give you a funny after taste either.  If you're looking for a bite of energy in the morning (and not one that will make you crash) then I recommend getting a pack of Trident Vitality along with a regular cup of black coffee.  What a way to start of your day!

review/summary: "Well, we're finally getting some more RETSIN" - Jerry Seinfeld
review/text: *written by her husband*<br /><br />So when I heard that they were going to have Ginseng in this gum, I just thought it was totally unnecessary.  I mean, isn't the taste supposed to already move ya? (Juicy Fruit)  Shouldn't a minty gum already give you "that little lift" of "pure chewing satisfaction"?  (Wrigley's Spearamint) You would think that if you put "a piece of America" (again Wrigley's) in your mouth, it would make you energized already.  But since this product is made in Mexico, maybe we're supposed to see something unique.<br /><br />Look, let's face it, I like how it chews when I first put it in my mouth. I could chew it for about an hour before I could get very tired of it.  And I've practically used about half the pack they've given me.  The aftertaste is pretty cool and nice.  So on that account, I can give this a very good rating.<br /><br />But...ginseng?  Ah, I suppose it takes all kinds to advertise.  Just like how we are glad that we are finally getting some more RETSIN.  But for me, all I want is some sort of gum that will double my pleasure and keep me humming along.  I guess it does the trick.

review/summary: This Humdrum Gum Left Me Glum
review/text: Summary: This is a mint gum with ginseng, packed in a 9 piece bubble pack. It has an interesting flavor, but fell short on the two things I really look for in gum - long lasting flavor and fresh breath.<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />- The flavor is really good. The ginseng adds a bit of exotic spice that compliments the mint nicely.<br /><br />- The texture is great. The outside is crisp, and the inside is so soft that I thought at first that the gum might have a liquid center. Biting into one is really fun.<br /><br />What could have been better:<br /><br />- The flavor drops off quickly. The flavor is really strong for the first minute or so, but after a few minutes, I can barely taste mint. (That last hint of mint does last quite a while, however).<br /><br />- There's little or no breath freshening effect.<br /><br />All in all, I liked the flavor, texture and freshness but I think I can get more for my money -- i.e., gum that leaves me with minty breath and holds its flavor longer.  "Tooth whitening" would be a plus too.

Unlike another reviewer, I had no problems with the gum not sticking to my permanent retainer.<br /><br />Overall I like it - I can't say that I was getting a buzz from the ginseng, but it's not too bad. I do like the the feel of breathing out a mint flavor from my nose.

review/summary: Great taste....will not keep you up.
review/text: For full transparency, I have to mention that I am a Trident fan. I do not normally chew any other brand. With that said, I tried the Trident Vitality Awaken gum, and the taste is typical Trident mint with a HINT of ginseng. Most people probably wouldn't taste it, but if you try the regular peppermint and the Vitality, you will notice a difference. It's initial flavor, like most others, is much stronger, and mellows within a minute or so. That is not to say that it loses its flavor. It lasts as long as other Trident gum. I did not time it, but at least half an hour. AS for the strength of the taste, I did not find it as strong as an Altoid, but still, it is NOT mild....it will clear your sinuses. Two problems with this, however....First, the packaging....while I like the fact that I won't lose a piece of gum in my pocket, I am not thrilled with having to open the box, pull out the gum packet and then pop a piece out. It's more work than I am used to just for a pack of gum. Of course, you can just keep the packet and toss the box (that's what I did). The other is the assumption that AWAKEN would keep me awake....it did not. Now, keep in mind, if I drink one cup of coffee at 5pm I'm up until 3-4am. I take off half a star for those....and it's just enough for me not to round up to 5 stars. I like the flavor, I like the consistency, and even the packaging looks refreshing....and it is. If you like peppermint, give it a try, you'll probably like it!

Not only is the taste striking but above all the flavor is longer lasting than even the regular Trident products.<br /><br />Trident continues a trend that I find distasteful, however.  That is a case of Under sizing.  It has not been that long ago but you could buy a half gallon of ice cream but not now.  It's 56 or 48 oz for the same price or more.<br /><br />While I sincerely dislike under sizing, it will not cause me to stop buying the new Trident.

review/summary: tasty and long lasting
review/text: I found this gum to be pretty good. Its a sweet (but not sugary) peppermint. Great for after dinner, and long lasting.  I don't believe in the ginseng stuff so I am not going comment on that, beyond the fact that I don't feel particularly 'energized' after chewing it.  I would think they would promote more the fact that the sweetener they use in the gum has been shown scientifically to inhibit tooth decay.  I chewed for well over 35 minutes with no loss of flavor, and only slight stiffening.

review/summary: Very pepperminty and long lasting flavor
review/text: This is a super minty gum and the hint of ginseng flavor makes it a little more interesting than the average peppermint gum. I like that it's sugar free and has Xylitol added, which helps reduce cavities. If you can't brush your teeth during the day, chewing this gum is the next best way to have a cleaner mouth and better breath. I love the 10-pack container, very convienient. Everyone in my family who tried this gum liked it as much as I did. 5 stars!

review/summary: My husband says two pieces are enough even for his big mouth
review/text: I got this gum for review for the Vine program, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I am not a big gum chewer, but I do like it both as a sweet treat and to freshen my mouth. Usually peppermints are too strong for me, but this one was just perfect - it definitely has that minty snap to it yet it's not overwhelming. I will definitely be buying this gum in the future.<br /><br />As an added endorsement, my husband chews gum all the time, and the more minty, the better. He even likes Altoids  which make me tear up. He usually chew  Dentyne Ice Sugarless Gum, Artic Chill and he will chew 3 or 4 pieces at a time. He said to tell you all, and I quote, "I only need two pieces of this for my big mouth".<br /><br />Sold. So recommended for those of you who like minty gums, and even for those of you who think you don't. Give it a try and see if you like it as much as I do.

review/summary: A Tasty Sugar-Free Chew
review/text: I've been chewing Trident sugar-free gum for decades because the lack of sugar seems like the best way to go when grinding into my teeth for hours.<br /><br />This is a very different gum from the old Trident that I'm used to,it has a sugar-free shell that coats the outsides of the gum,kind of like the Chiclets I have chewed in the past but without the sugar.<br /><br />It's a very nice gum and it has Ginseng added to it as well.<br /><br />The taste is really good and there's no weird aftertaste from the sweetener like some gums I've chewed in the past.<br /><br />It's a very nice and refreshing gum to chew

review/summary: Nice!
review/text: I chew gum a lot and I only like certain minty flavors. This peppermint is more subtle than most gum. I prefer a stronger minty taste, but it tastes very good. The gum stays soft and doesn't become a chore to chew like some typically do. The taste doesn't last as long as Orbit gum, which is what I usually chew. Apparently there's ginseng in it, but I don't really notice any difference from other gum. My only other complaint is that the packets only come with 9 pieces. I have problems enough switching empty packets for full ones in my purse with Orbit which has 14 pieces in it.

review/text: I say this whole-heartedly, this gum is really good! We chew a lot of gum, everyone takes some when we go to church, three times a week! So that is a lot. This gum made our breaths fresh, tasted really good, not too much peppermint. Just the right amount. It held its flavor and didn't dissolve into a big slimy mess. I can't wait to try the other 2, this one really set a good tone for the rest!!!

review/text: This sugarless gum has a great peppermint taste that is subtler than most other gums with peppermint. It has a dash of ginseng and has a lasting (about 10 minutes) peppermint flavor all for under 5 calories a piece. The taste is smooth and left my breath feeling refreshed.  I would definitely purchase this.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the names Vitality and Awaken on the package because there's no caffeine in this gum.

review/summary: Good Stuff
review/text: I'm not sure that this gum improved my well-being or any of those other sorts of claims, but it was tasty and pleasant to chew, which is pretty much all I ask of my chewing gum anyway.  This gum has a good peppermint flavor, though not too strong.  I don't really taste the ginger, but I suspect that's what tempers the peppermint.  The texture is quite soft; softer, I'd say, than other chewing gums, which I found pleasant.  This gum kept it's flavor well.  Can't really ask for more than that.

review/summary: Great little pick me up!!!
review/text: This review is for the Trident Vitality flavor "Awaken (peppermint with ginseng)".<br /><br />What a great idea.  I always chew mint gum at work, (Trident or some dental equivalent whenever possible).  I like that it's good for your teeth and keeps coffee breath at bay.<br /><br />But now with the Vitality line, there is an added bonus...a bit of energy with your gum.  As far as flavor, consistency and dental compatibility, Awaken is indistinguishable from a regular piece of peppermint Trident.  But Awaken has a bit of ginseng thrown in.  Ginseng is an age old root extract that people have used for centuries.  (I used to take ginseng pills when I was on a serious workout regimen.  And man did it work!)  This gum isn't as strong as a pill of course, but I have to say that it was a perfect afternoon refresher.  Rather than choking down a cup of coffee in 90 degree heat or drinking one of those jitter inducing energy drinks, a refreshing stick of gum with a boost is a much preferred alternative.  I highly recommend this to those who chew gum regularly and like a quick and easy way to get a boost.

review/summary: Mild peppermint flavor lasts longer than you can chew it
review/text: This is an excellent new gum by Trident that really gives Take 5 a run for its money in the flavor department.  I chewed a single piece for over 45 minutes, got tired of chewing it and yet it still retained a lot of flavor.  The peppermint was not overwhelming and after a while you could taste the subtle hints of ginseng that really balanced it out.  For the first five minutes it was rather soft and mushy but ended up keeping a nice consistency which lasted longer than I did.  Great new Sugar free gum.

review/summary: Okay taste, soft chew
review/text: Trident has produced a new line of sugarless chewing gum with some extra-healthy properties added in.  This particular flavor is infused with Ginseng, which is known for its health benefits.<br /><br />As a sugarless gum, "Vitality: Awaken" is decent, but not great.  I am a tea drinker, but it almost tastes odd when the hint of ginseng shows up within it.  There is a nice minty flavor, which isn't overpowering and doesn't sting my mouth as some mint gums do.<br /><br />Each pack comes with 9 pieces in a foil-backed plastic tray, so each serving is punched through and doesn't have to be unwrapped from paper or foil.  For only 9 pieces, the price is a little high, though.<br /><br />The gum held its flavor for a long time and also didn't become overly stiff-- it's easy to chew, nice and soft.<br /><br />Overall I give this a somewhat positive review, but I'm not crazy about the ginseng taste and the price.  Free samples of this are fine, but I probably wouldn't go to the trouble of purchasing it in the future.

review/summary: Refreshingly Minty
review/text: When I first got these, I thought they were going to be some gum form of energy drinks, with a promise to wake you up and get you through the day.  That is an awful lot to promise for a chewing gum.<br /><br />But it turns out that, while they might not get you through the day, the Vitality gum is actually quite the eye opener.  There is a really nice, sharp mint taste that stays strong while you are chewing.  The package lists a "Dash of Ginseng," and I really think it is just "a dash" seeing as how I couldn't find ginseng on the ingredients list.  But even without an herbal enhancer, whatever is in this gum does in fact wake you up and get you started.<br /><br />I really enjoyed these, enough to keep buying them on my own when my supply runs out.  I like having a piece to chew on in the morning when I am heading for work to give me a little morning boost.

review/summary: More gum should contain Xylitol
review/text: I like Trident gums because many of them contain xylitol. Xylitol is a naturally occuring sugar which has been shown to be toxic to mouth bacteria. The bacteria take up xylitol thinking it is a sugar they can metabolize, but instead, they die. Hence, xylitol prevents tooth decay and all that bad stuff. In addition, some studies suggest that the xylitol from chewing gum can go up into the eustachian tube and prevent some types of infections, like a middle ear infection.<br /><br />Trident Vitality lists xylitol as the fifth ingredient. While it's great that it's even present, I think they could put more of it in the gum. For instance, the Lotte Xylitol gum (available at Korean and other markets) lists xylitol as the #1 ingredient, in addition to just gum base and applemint flavor - and it tastes good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Trident Vitality includes artifical ingredients which probably aren't good for us:<br />Isomalt, gum base, maltitol syrup, maltitol, xylitol, natural and artifical flavoring (including ginseng extract); less than 2% of: acacia, acesulfame potassium, aspartame, blue 1, candelilla wax, erythritol, glycerin, soy lecithin, sucralose and titanium dioxide (color). Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.<br /><br />At the least, I hope that these big gum manufacturers will move away from using aspartame.

review/summary: Trident Vitality
review/text: Trident Vitality Awaken SGL, 9-Count (Pack of 10)<br /><br />  I love chewing gum and can get particular about what I buy. For me, long lasting flavor is a must.<br />I have been chewing Stride and 5 for the past year. I do like to switch the brands and I was glad I could try out Trident Vitality Awaken.<br />I really like the packaging that comes with this blister pack of gum. It has a fold over top instead of a sleeve that most brands use for their gum.<br />I like this because the gum stays protected in my purse. With the sleeve packaging I have to put the gum in a separate pocket or else the gum ends up in the bottom of my purse.<br />Trident vitality is pillowy soft and stays that way well after two hours of chewing.<br />The flavor is minty but not potent and it isn't overly juicy sweet where all the flavor is swallowed in the first 5 seconds.<br />I love to snap my gum and blow bubbles and I can do that with this brand with no problems.<br />The flavor here is really good and it does last for the duration that I chewed (more than 2 hours-Violet Beauregarde anyone, lol) I love this gum and I will be adding it to my list next time I am at the store! I also plan on trying the other flavors!

review/summary: Nice flavor gum, your dentist will like it too!
review/text: This gum has an interesting, vibrant peppermint flavor. I liked it as it wasn't overpowering, but it was still nicely minty. It also had a nice "mouth feel" not being too hard to too soft.<br /><br />I didn't notice anything out of the ginseng part. But then again, I chew quite a bit of peppermint gum, so I got it for the sugar-free peppermint part, not the ginseng part.<br /><br />Comes in a nice package that will protect the gum, but still has a slightly modern look. One quibble- it comes in packs of nine, not a dozen as is more common.<br /><br />Chewing sugar-free gum between and after meals is very good for dental hygiene.  Not as good as brushing, sure, but it's a handy way to help keep your teeth and breath fresh.

review/summary: Loaded With Peppermint That Last A Loooooong Time
review/text: This is a nice, strong peppermint flavored sugar free gum. It is the smaller pieces of gum with the hard shell on it and a soft center with a burst of peppermint flavor and the Ginseng. I admit that I'm not a fan of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6KVIO">Chiclets Peppermint Chewing Gum</a> like gums. When you first chew it, you really notice the strong peppermint flavor. The gum starts out rather soft and sticky, don't try blowing a bubble right away, but it firms up the longer you chew it. The peppermint lasted until I was done with the gum and probably could go a lot longer.<br /><br />Now, the packaging sucks. You have a fancy little box and a foil package of nine pieces of gum, which is way too much packaging for nine pieces of gum. I also don't understand the point of the Ginseng in it, I don't thing it made a difference, especially when the peppermint is strong enough to kill every last germ in my mouth and perk me up.<br /><br />I admit getting this free for a review was great, but honestly, I wouldn't buy it when I can get more gum in a pack of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZCY4Q">Orbit Peppermint Gum</a>.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Author of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.

review/summary: Peppermint for the first kiss, ginseng for the libido
review/text: Trident Vitality is more or less an overpriced breath mint with ginseng panacea. Some buyers no doubt are looking for an energy boost while others hope for increased nitric oxide output (improvements in erectile dysfunction). I just wanted to rid my mouth of a club sandwich stink (it worked). This is not a popping, snapping, long-time chewing gum but it will revive your breath.<br /><br />Taste: The peppermint is strong enough to mask what I ate for lunch without searing my taste buds. The ginseng itself is not perceptible beneath the "peppy peppermint."<br /><br />Texture: The light candy coating melts away to a soft chew with ginseng grit. As the crunching effect disappears the consistency becomes sinewy -- about 3-to-4 minutes -- and less enjoyable to chew. By this time, my breath is minty and I dispose of the gum.<br /><br />Packaging: If a gum company ever needed to submit itself to Amazon's Frustration-Free Packaging Trident would be the one. Most pellet packs slide into a cardboard sleeve. Trident instead chose to engineer an entire box to house nine pieces of gum. Overkill? Yes. User-friendly? No.<br /><br />Rating: Three stars.<br /><br />BTW: The American Dental Association finds that the physical action of chewing these gums for 20 minutes after eating stimulates saliva flow, which helps to prevent cavities by reducing plaque acids and strengthening teeth.

review/summary: Lively and pleasant
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that the gum from Trident was indeed lively with a good taste.  I've had Trident gum before (though I'm not much of a gum user).  This gum had a hard shell (some of the Trident gum I've tried in the past came in a paper wrapper and had no candy shell), but thankfully, it was a soft gum, and did not make me concerned I was going to break a tooth when I first popped it into my mouth (I've had gum like that, especially gum containing xylitol, though I don't know if that ingredient was responsible for that factor).<br /><br />I also didn't know if I could taste the 'dash' of ginseng; I couldn't, or, at least, the taste wasn't unpleasant.<br /><br />The overwhelming taste one experiences is positive.  I don't know if I got a burst of vitality or not, but the gum tasted good, lasted a long time, and I'd probably get this again.<br /><br />Recommended for those patients who chew gum.

review/text: This gum tastes really good and doesn't have the 'sting' of some minty gum.  There is a liquid center that thankfully doesn't gush and is barely discernable. There are some chewing gums in which the flavor lasts longer, but this gum would last long enough for most people.  Once you reach a certain age, you don't wanna be chewing gum for long periods of time anyway. (Maybe I should just speak for myself in saying that.)<br /><br />To sum it up, my mouth feels clean when I pop a peice of this gum in after I drink a cup of coffee, so I'm happy.

review/text: I loved the flavor of this gum--not as strong as some wintermint I have had---very refreshing clean feeling.  Doesn't stick to my tooth that has a cap--which is a plus.  didn't easily or quickly lose its flavor.  I don't know if it made me vital or awake as the name implied--i didn't feel either when I chewed the gum.<br /><br />These are not sticks of gum--they are squares--crunch a little like chicklets gum--but if i remember right, this is bigger than they are.  While one piece is sufficient--I also liked chewing two.<br /><br />This has enough "fresh" taste that it helps my daughter with her sensory integration issues--any strong flavored gum helps her.
