review/summary: AWESOME Acai' Sorbet
review/text: Belizza Acai' Sorbet is soooo good!  By buying this sorbet, you will save a lot of money making your own Acai' smoothies than buying them.  Fat free, dairy free, cholesterol free - the only 'bad' thing is the sugar content.  However, the health benefits from acai' make the sugar worth while - and it tastes sooo good!  I will buy this again, and would recommend it to anyone who loves acai'.

review/summary: Not quite up to Brasilian standards
review/text: We Americans are being flooded with bad a�ai products.  Monivie is the biggest scam on the planet, and most of our a�ai has too many fillers.  This product is one of them.  Corn syrup in a�ai?  Only in America baby!<br /><br />A�ai is expensive to import from Brasil I know, and these companies are trying to make a profit which is fine.  But I wish people could try the real acai just once...  they would love it.  Most American have never gotten the real acai yet.<br /><br />This product is just too "watered down" and the acai taste and texture not quite right.  The is an ice cream company and the product is not offensive, just not a�ai.  Sambazon has less fillers and the product is not bad.  Acai Roots is<br />certainly the most authentic and highest quality if you can find it.

review/summary: Delicious!  Same sorbet that you get from places that sell acai bowls
review/text: Was weary of ordering sorbet from an online retailer.  Took a chance and received within 3 days of placing the order.  Came in a big box with dry ice, which made the sorbet hard as a rock.  I was so excited to try it that I ended up putting one of the pints on the microwave for about 1:30mins to thaw.  Yumm!!  Deliciousness in a carton.<br /><br />I use it with smoothies (bought a big bag of frozen fruits from Costco) and add a couple of scoops of sorbet.  I've also made my own Acai bowls with two scoops of sorbet, granola, sliced bananas and honey.  A+++

review/summary: My dog loves these! Closest I've found to the "old" greenies
review/text: My Maltese absolutely loved the old Greenies.  Then they changed their "recipe" and she wouldn't even try the new version.  Turned up her nose and that was that.  I can't recall the exact names of the other types of "Greenies" out there and there are only a few, but regardless, she didn't like any of them.  We moved on to another type of treat because I didn't think there was ever going to be another "Greenie" type treat that would measure up to the original.  On the outside chance she might like these, I gave them a try.  Turns out she really, really likes them.  So my search to replace the original "greenie" is finally over!

I am also pleased about the ingredients as there is not a whole lot to them. I really loved this chocolate and will be purchasing it again. Thank you Ghirardelli for making such a wonderful, warm and bold chocolate!

review/summary: Intense Dark Chocolate
review/text: Each bar is eight squares of intense dark chocolate.  Each square is about 60 calories each.  There are only 5g of sugar per 4 squares so these are low in sugar--total fat is 38% daily value for four squares.  A square a day of this intense dark chocolate is satisfying and healthy.  Nutritionist now recommend an ounce of 70% cacoa chocolate a day.  It's a healthy and tasty treat.  Some family members like to keep it in the freezer.  I prefer it room temperature.  This is a non-guilty pleasure and a satisfying dark chocolate treat.

It is extremely smooth and intense.  It's not bitter.  I have others that I haven't tried yet, but this one is outstanding.  Lovers of dark chocolate will love this one.  It is everything I had hoped to find.  I'm looking forward to trying the others that I purchased to compare them.

review/text: I am a foodie but I never gave a second thought to improving on dried prunes. I used to enjoy the Sunsweet prunes with lemon flavor and it never occurred to me that there are better prunes on the market. Turns out these are far superior to Sunsweet. They are plump, soft, juicy, and much more like eating a fresh French prune. (Of course, these aren't flavored.)<br /><br />And although it's not a big deal, I also appreciate that they come in a glass jar that I can reuse. The label rips off easily.

review/summary: This is a premium roasted seaweed that is an exellent snack or cooking supplement ...
review/text: Everyone familiar with seaweed knows that is has a high nutritional value and can be either used in cooking or as a snack.  There are several different varieties and this one is a green seaweed.  Each piece is rolled wafer-thin and is approximately 2 1/2" x 3 /2," a dozen pieces per tray.  They are in individual trays, each packed with a Samsung silica-gel packet to keep them crisp and dry.  There are nine sleeves with three trays in each.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Seaweed, corn oil, salt, sesame oil<br /><br />Nutritional Facts<br />(One .017 oz tray)<br /><br />Calories  30<br /><br />Total Fat 1.6g<br />  Saturated Fat 0g<br />  Trans Fat 0g<br /><br />Cholesterol 0mg<br /><br />Sodium 75mg<br /><br />Total Carbohydrates 2g<br /><br />Dietary Fiber 2g<br /><br />Sugars 0g<br /><br />Protein 2g<br /><br />NOTE:  Each package carries a cautionary note that claims that the seaweed is processed in a "facility that also processes milk, eggs, fish, crustacean, shellfish, tree nut, peanuts, wheat, soybeans, shrimp and sulphites products."<br /><br />There is a relatively low sodium content,but these have a very salty taste.  For the snacker who craves salt, but not the calories that other snacks offer, this premium roasted seaweed would be ideal.  After eating a package my salt craving virtually disappears.  They can also be used to add to soups or a side additive to your rice or sushi.  The trays are a little larger than I expected, but can be used by the gourmet on the go.

review/text: This stuff is great and I like the way it taste. I would have given 5 stars but I must ask where are they harvesting the seaweed from?? I google earthed the location where the company is (Gyeongsangbukdo,South Korea) and in a straight line they are only a little over 600 miles away from the Fukushima Nuclear Accident. That raises my concern. Anyone know where they are getting the seaweed from? I really like the stuff but until I can confirm a low risk with the product probably will stay away from any more purchases.

review/summary: Sweet, intense & yummy!
review/text: These confections are small (about the size of the Smarties candy roll mints), a bit sweet, and powerfully flavored.  The ingredients listed on the back of the container are simple:  Xylitol, natural lemon oil, natural lime oil  and natural tumeric powder.  That's it.<br /><br />There's 100 mints to a metal lidded container, similar in size and structure to the Altoids or the old metal Sucrets boxes.  Fits nicely in your pocket or purse.<br /><br />These won't affect glucose levels for diabetics as xylitol is metabolized independently of insulin.<br /><br />Besides the lemon-line, licorice and peppermint flavors that Amazon currently carries, they also come in fruit punch, wintermint, and cocoa mint, which I hope Amazon will carry soon.<br /><br />To sum it up, they're just plain yummy.

review/summary: all right by me !!!
review/text: Dentyne Ice Sugar Free Spearmint chewing gum has saved the day for me many, many times. I always keep a pack in the glove compartment of my car. I also carry the gum in my pocket so I can pop a piece in my mouth to freshen my breath just before social occasions--and even just before a dental visit!<br /><br />The gum is sweetened with sorbitol and aspartame instead of sugar; the absence of sugar is better for your teeth. The sorbitol and aspartame substitutes for sugar may make this a good chewing gum for diabetics; but please double check that with your doctor if you have any concerns about that. A piece of gum has no sodium. It is very low in carbohydrates, too. It even comes with a freshness expiration date stamped onto the reverse of the package! Great! It does contain phenylalanine; if that is a concern for you then I would not recommend this product. It does not appear to be kosher, either, just in case that is important to you.<br /><br />In addition, the 12 piece of gum pack is very slender; and this makes it very easy to carry it with you in a pocket or a ladies pocketbook.<br /><br />Overall, I can't tell you how many times this gum has served as a really great breath freshener--I can't count that high! It also makes for a tasty, pleasant chewing gum. Thank you, Dentyne, for making this wonderful chewing gum! I am one loyal customer!  SMILES<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: How about this idea?
review/text: How about this idea? Even though we buy the non-hydrogenated "natural" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non-hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!

review/summary: Yay! I &lt;3 Peanut Butter, and now I can actually have it!
review/text: So... my preferred breakfast is 9 or 12 grain toast with peanut butter. But at the end of the week that's a LOT of calories and fat. So I started having cereal or oatmeal and I started losing some of the 10 pounds or so that I've put on in the last couple of years.<br />No matter how much I exercised or ate carefully, that peanut butter was doing me in.  Now I mix a bit of PB2 every morning and save hundreds of calories per week-- and I still get to have my preferred breakfast.<br />The taste? Not going to lie- it isn't exactly the same. But it's damn close and was EASY to make the switch. I don't even measure anymore-- just add a few drops of water at a time till I like the consistency. It takes about a minute-- long enough for my bread to be toasted- so no big deal.<br />I'm lazy and always hungry-- but this absolutely works for me.<br />I'm so delighted to have discovered it.

It actually tastes REALLY good! I was very impressed! I've used it so far by itself on toast, and in a PB & J sandwich and I'm very happy with it. I get to enjoy peanut butter again for half the points!!!! If you're on a diet and love peanut butter, definitely try this! The first time I added too much water, which made it way too creamy, but since then I've lessened the water and it has a natural peanut butter consistency.

review/text: I purchased this item mostly out of curiosity.  I have been hearing about it and people that are on a strict diet trying to lose weight often rave about it.  To me I will never use it as just straight peanut butter on a cracker or bread.  I do believe it is good to put in smoothies, if you want peanut butter in your smoothie.  You can vary the consistency depending on  how much water you use.  For smoothie, you can just add the powder right into your blender.  The taste to me is rather bland.  Sure-obviously it is missing the FAT- but it is lacking in something else as well...just can't put my finger on it...

I kept meaning to sprinkle it over ice cream, but used it up on the yogurt I take to work. Left it in the office kitchen, and it's very convenient to use. You won't believe how good it tastes! I will branch out using it in different ways on my next jar. Yum!

review/text: Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!

review/summary: Good peanut butter taste
review/text: This stuff is great because of the fat and calorie content. It still contains some protein like normal peanut butter which is good. Normally I would say that the added salt and sugar isn't neccassary but in this case it definetly is because without it it woud probably be pretty gross. As far as the texture goes don't expect it to be like full fat peanut butter as the texture is sort of "gluey" but not unpleasant. I like to eat it on toast or with red grapes.

review/summary: Love PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter
review/text: I got PB2 powdered peanut butter for mixing in with my morning shakes. I absolutely love it! It tastes great and mixes in great with no clumps. I love 2 T for 45 calories as opposed to 200 in regular peanut butter. It says you can mix with water to make a solid peanut butter, but I haven't tried that yet. I've already bought my second order which included the chocolate PB2 and love that just as much! For more on my thoughts on PB2, visit: [...]

review/summary: A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!
review/text: I am a peanut butter lover, but not a fan of the high calories and fat. As an extreme health junkie, I understand the notion behind moderation, but I admit that it's a bit hard to obey when it comes to peanut butter. Because of this, I haven't eaten peanut butter in a long time (about 3 years!)<br /><br />About 2 months ago, PB2 entered my life and I could NOT have been any happier with this product. It's so amazingly yummy and perfect! I use it in powder form for my smoothies or I add water and some cinnamon and use it as a spread for crackers. I also use it for other foods like my baked tofu or sauteed shrimp. I love that you can adjust the consistency depending on the amount of water you add. Sometimes I can make it really thick by adding a little bit of water or more smooth with more water. I love that flexibility. I will be using this product for the rest of my life, as long as its still in production!

review/summary: I really wanted to love this product...
review/text: I was so hopeful that _finally_ a lower fat, great tasting peanut butter was available. But when it arrived it was a huge let down. Maybe if I were to add it to smoothies like some reviewers did I would have liked the taste. But using it as regular peanut butter was my plan. Unfortunately, it just didn't cut it. The flavor was weird. Not at all peanut buttery. The consistency was ok, the color a little pale, but all that aside, the flavor has to work or the product wouldn't for me. I guess it's time to accept that good peanut butter is high in calories and finding a lower calorie replacement is not in the cards for me. Oh well...I tried.

review/summary: Powdered peanut butter??  YES!!
review/text: Well, I have to say that I thought this would be pretty bad. I admit it.<br />Deconstituted peanuts - wow. Dry, tasteless, useless, but less fat.<br /><br />I have to say that I was wrong!<br />It smells pretty darned good when you open the jar up. It is powder, so<br />I used a knife to only cut half the lid off. That way, if my fumble fingers<br />dropped the jar, I would not spill as much of this - it is pretty pricey.<br /><br />I like peanut butters, but don't eat enough of it to really use it up before<br />it separates into oil/goo.  This is the answer for me. You just mix up what you need!<br /><br />Basically, this is just powder that mixes with water. While directions say two Tbls of powder<br />to one Tbl of water, who wants to really measure peanut butter? Best eyeball judging that I could<br />say for advice, is to get a small bowl, and put enough water in it to be about the amount<br />that you want to have of peanut butter. Use a spoon or fork, either one. Sprinkle the<br />powder over the water generously and mix, mix, mix. If it is too runny for your desired use,<br />sprinkle a little more powder and mix again. Repeat until it is just like you want it. I did find<br />that I had to mix it more than I thought I would to get the desired consistency/texture. If you<br />don't mix it enough, it will feel grainy to the tongue.<br /><br />The freedom to have it slightly runny for dipping, or thicker for spreading, is so nice!<br />While I honestly thought I wouldn't like it, I really do. I made a small batch up, intending to<br />dip my finger in it for taste testing. This is how I learned about not putting so much water in the bowl.<br />I had more peanut butter than I really wanted. So, son and I whipped out a package of Ritz crackers<br />and thoroughly enjoyed dipping/spreading it on the crackers. There was only the color of the bowl<br />left when we were through!<br /><br />If you've been on the fence about it, especially since it is a little costly, just jump in.<br />I can't see any waste in this product (except maybe spilling it). If you are trying to watch your<br />fat intake, this is the PB to eat.<br /><br />I have ordered a jar of the PB2 Chocolate tonight. I simply have to try it too. I hope it is as good<br />as this one!  YUM!  Now, I wonder if the same company might want to make this in almond or cashew<br />versions?!  *HINT TO THE COMPANY*

review/text: I think the concept of this item is great. I have only eaten mixed with water and it's just okay. I don't like that sugar has been added since I only use natural PB that needs to be stirred w/ no extra oils etc. I like PB but am not a 'nut' about it. Perhaps this will taste better mixed with other items so I'll try but since I don't eat lots to begin with, it's not a product I'll repurchase.

review/summary: I thought it was too good to be true.
review/text: I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it.

review/text: I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast

review/summary: Unbelievable!! Price is the only catch.
review/text: I was a little hesitant to try this...how could it possibly hope to imitate REAL peanut butter with any success? But, I love peanut butter but hate the calories, so I decided to take all the good reviews to heart and give it a go. I was honestly shocked when I mixed up my first tablespoons. It felt, looked, and smelled like real peanut butter! The taste is very close...obviously it's not going to taste exactly like real PB, but for the calories you are saving, it's surprisingly on target. Also, when you eat it with other things, as most people do, you don't even notice the difference. I spread it on toast and topped with honey...and it was SO delicious!!!<br /><br />A 45-calorie serving is two tablespoons mixed with one tablespoon of water. Be warned, this makes quite a small amount of peanut butter. It is just enough to coat one slice of toast, and actually, I would like a tad more. So yes, this stuff is very expensive and you don't get very much.
