review/summary: Diet Flavors are Not Great - Nasty Aftertaste
review/text: I absolutely love my Sodastream because I drink a lot of sparkling water and this has saved me a fortune! Recently I thought it would be great to have some of the soda flavorings around for guests, mixed drinks, etc. However, I have not been thrilled with diet flavors I have tried so far. Of the three I have tried (diet tonic, diet ginger ale, and diet root beer), I think the diet root beer is the best, but is not even close to any of the name brand diet root beers.  Both the diet ginger ale and diet tonic have a nasty aftertaste - way worse than any name brand diet soda on the market.  The worst part about the aftertaste is that it doesn't seem to go away. As I write this, I still have a bad taste in my mouth - and it's been nearly a half hour since I drank some of the diet ginger ale. That alone compelled me to pull out my computer and log a review. I have tried them several times now, altering the amount of syrup to see if it would make a difference, and each time I end up pouring it down the drain. I am SO disappointed by this as I had high hopes for flavorings.

review/text: I did NOT like this lemon lime flavor.  It made me gag.  It tastes like some kind of horrible medicine.<br /><br />The diet Cranberry was drinkable, I can tell how other people would like it but it was not my favorite.<br /><br />Dr. Pete is great!<br /><br />I have yet to try any other flavors.  I have made my own syrups to use with it instead.

review/summary: Win some, lose some
review/text: I recently received a soda stream, and have been playing around with the flavors. What I find is that everyone has their own amount of syrup they like added to the bottle. For example, with the cream soda I had to use about half the recommended amount, but with the diet root beer I like to add more mix. The real thing with these flavors - you just have to try them. I really like the diet cranberry, diet grapefruit and the diet root beer is literally the best soda I've ever had - diet or non-diet. Some others I didn't like so much. The cola didn't really do it for me, and I'm on the fence over the ginger ale. There is a bit of an after taste on the sodas, but they do have a lower calorie count (even the non-diets) than regular sodas. All in all I like the soda stream, it's fun, but I still buy Coke and some other sodas. I am looking forward to trying some more of the exotic soda stream flavors (BBB has almost all of them in stock) and playing with making my own.<br /><br />3 stars because... well, win some, lose some with the flavors. It's all subject to taste.

review/summary: Fabulous
review/text: This is fabulous. Heard about it on Sean Hannity and wanted to try it. My wife bought it for me as an early Christmas present. The set up and operation is super simple. To me the taste is excellent because it is so fresh. I like Polar sodas and those work out to about $.98 a liter. This does $.67 a liter. The diet cola does not have the classic metal taste and no aspartame. If you love diet soda you will love this. If you don't, you will leave a poor review. I thought it would taste like a cheap store brand diet cola, and it is so much better than that. It reminded me of Coke Classic.

review/summary: Diet drinks taste like diet soda from the old days
review/text: I got a SodaStream for my birthday.  It comes with a 12 pack syrup sampler with 6 diet syrups and 6 "regular" syrups.  I have only tried the diet, caffeine-free syrups.  None of them come close to tasting anything as good as the diet drinks I buy at the grocery store.  Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.  I use my Soda Stream to make seltzer and it does a great job at that!  I've been experimenting with using drink mixes like Crystal Light, and those work OK.  DISCLAIMER:  I'm one of the folks who get a bad aftertaste with Splenda and Splenda is the sweetener used in the diet SodaStream drink syrups.

review/summary: My review
review/text: Of the Sodastream syrups, this is my favorite.  Unlike the other flavors, which are very often poor remakes of classic brands, the orange flavor is unique. It has qualities of Orange Crush and Sunkist, but adds an original flavor that only it has.  Overall, it is a great flavor, and even pop snobs will likely enjoy it.  If you can't live without the classics, any flavor (including Orange) is not worth buying though, so be cautious, and try buying one instead of a three pack the first time.

review/summary: Regular Cola has Artificial Sweetener
review/text: I bought the regular cola flavor to give it a try, but after tasting it, I realized that it had artificial sweetener. I didn't think to read the ingredients before buying, since it wasn't diet. Not sure why they did that, since the first ingredient is SUGAR. I can't give it a good rating, as I stay away from artificial sweeteners and I feel that they were a bit deceptive by not making the fact that it contains artificial sweeteners more noticeable. I don't drink cola every day (maybe once a week or less) and I feel that sugar is OK in moderation.

review/text: I have the SodaStream and love it. I am a diet soda drinker and love all the varieties of flavors my local retailer carries. My favorite is the pink grapefruit. I came on Amazon expecting to find a deal and was shocked at the price some people are selling the flavor syrup for. HIGHWAY ROBBERY! These can be purchased for $3.99 - $4.99 (Bed Bath and Beyond, Kohls)for single bottles . I thought maybe this was the price for a double pack, but doesn't appear to be. At this price, this machine would not be very cost effective now would it?

review/summary: Ginger Ale Flavor is quite tasty!
review/text: The other reviews are correct in the fact that the "suggested" retail price is $4.99 per bottle.  Some sellers are ripping the consumers off by pricing them higher.  As always... caveat emptor!<br /><br />The Ginger Ale syrup is very good in my opinion.  It is very close to Canada Dry's Ginger Ale in crispness and tartness.<br /><br />I use the "three buzz" carbonation method and then fill the syrup cap to the line in the cap about a 1/2" from the top of the filler.  This creates the perfect syrup to carbonation ratio and makes a very drinkable and tasty ginger ale!

We poured the recommended amount of syrup into the carbonated water and slurped.

review/text: I agree with all the reviews about the price. It's really ridiculous that the appeal of this machine for our family was the cost of soda vs. the cost of this stuff. It' is 1/3 the price per serving of store bought soda, 1/2 the caffeine, 1/3 the sugar and calories, but it still tastes amazing. And we don't have bags and bags of recycling, and we can make whatever soda we want when we want. At this price, it's basically just buying 3 cases of soda on sale... what's the point??? When you can order it online from ANYWHERE ELSE for half the price, this is just absurd. Please just search for it, you'll find a better price in about 10 seconds.

review/summary: Aftertaste
review/text: I bought the Sodastream after just looking at it for a while.  Then, decided to try it as I remember drinking "fizzies" many years ago and was shooting for that effect.  Sodastream does indeed add great fizz but beware the aftertaste.  I tried the orange and thought, while I was drinking it, that it was terrific.  But, then, for more than a day, I had an aftertaste like some of the diet drinks leave.  Same with the Root Beer.  And, even though the machine says add carbonation only to water and then add syrup, I decided to try adding carbonation to my own drinks, like Kool-Aid or Hawaiian Punch.  Other than being careful with the carbonation and making sure to clean the CO2 port afterward, it works very well.  However, even with my own drinks I still get the terrible aftertaste.  That part is very disappointing.  Not sure if that can even be removed.  Is it the carbonation itself?  Regular carbonated drinks do not have it.

I said wow that is a big jump $130 plus to just buy the unit then you gotta buy the charging cartridges "co2" and bottles then the syrup all told it was near 200 to get me started and ready to go. So I said to myself hey I can buy soda water in my store for 88 cents per 2 liters and the syrup makes 6 or so liters per bottle depending on how strong you want the taste I buy the energy mix 2 or 3 bottles at a time and it lasts me about a month I still buy other soda buy much less and no more paying 3 bucks a can for red bull,oh side note if you are into jager bombs and so are your party friends buy a bottle of this and some soda water bottle of jager and have fun in my opinion it tastes better than real red bull

review/summary: Some flavors OK , some questionable
review/text: Ive heard many reviews about Sodastream: most bad, a few OK. I understand that Sodastream sodas cant taste exactly like regular soda so im not expecting them to taste exact. With that said Im pretty pleased with or am OK with most of the flavors that ive tried. Bellow are my reviews of a few.<br /><br />Cola: 5/5 stars Doesnt taste exactly like Coke but is close. One of my favorites.<br /><br />Orange: 5/5 stars If youve tried different brands of Orange soda you will notice that some taste better than others. This tastes like cheaper dollar store orange soda, so is similar to Sunkist, but it still tastes pretty good & does taste like a known orange soda.<br /><br />Lemon Lime (Sprite): 4/5 Tastes like Sprite at first but leaves an odd after taste. Ive noticed that if you open your mouth after each drink the after taste is minimal. If it werent for the after taste I would give it 5 stars.<br /><br />Cranberry Raspberry: 5/5 Not sure what to compare it to, but it tastes great with no weird after flavor.<br /><br />Energy: 5/5 This came in the trial pack, & since im not into energy drinks I sipped it & had a friend try it. It gets 5 stars because it tastes just like Red Bull according to both of us.<br /><br />Dr. Pete: 3/5 Its OK but it tastes pretty vanillaish & not all that close to Dr. Pepper. You can sort of taste the similarity but not enough to say "WOW! JUST like or very similar to Dr. Pepper!!!".<br /><br />Overall Im still a big Sodastream fan, & most of the flavors ive tried I would buy again.

I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.

review/summary: The ENERGY drink is the only one I can tolerate, and I love that one!
review/text: We got a Sodastream for Christmas. My kids have lots of fun making soda, and for them it's really become a passed-fad already and it's only July. For myself though, I think all of the sodas are totally gross except for the Energy drink one. They all have this creepy flavor, I'm not sure what exactly it is?  You know how Coke tastes great, and Walmart  Cola tastes okay, if you had to drink it instead of Coke you would live, right? Well these soda flavors are like three notches below the generic sodas at the store. Like I mentioned, they all have some weird flavor.<br /><br />Except the Energy drink. WOW, if you like Red Bull, then you are going to LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It's like the flavor of Red Bull, bumped up ten times. Plus, I'd say it gives me more energy than Red Bull. Okay, not energy, but the shakes and the so-alert-I-may-explode feeling. It makes me so jittery, IF I drink a lot of it, that I can't think straight and my heart is pounding. If you like that, you'll love this.<br /><br />To me, I look for the Guarna (sp?) in energy drinks, and this has the absoute most guarna flavor of anything I've tried. I LOVE IT.

review/summary: Some really great and some really really bad
review/text: Diet Cranberry Raspberry - The BEST flavor I've tried yet. It's just sweet enough, great flavor, and calorie free. I always have at least three bottles of this in my cabinet at all times.<br /><br />Orange - Very sweet but good. I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more. I am cautiously optimistic about the diet ginger ale so that will be my next purchase.

review/summary: A fairly "meh" generic cola.
review/text: I love my Soda Stream, and most of the mixes I've used have been quite good (pretty much any of their fruit flavors, their Dr. Pepper substitute,  Root Beer and Energy Drink have all been quite tasty), however the one flavor that really stands out as a disappointment is the cola flavor. I can forgive the fact that it doesn't taste like Coke or Pepsi-- I have tried other "b-list" colas that tasted good in their own way-- however, this one is overall just plain bland. It's not sweet enough, and it lacks the "kick" that I expect from a cola. I tried making the most of it by adding additional ingredients-- once I used vanilla, and it made the soda even more bland. The other time i used some cheap whisky my room mate bought, and it was probably the nastiest mixed drink I've ever had (I'm not a heavy drinker though, keep in mind, and I blame the crappy alcohol more than the soda for that one).<br /><br />I have not explored other options for cola syrups yet, but this is one I don't expect I'll be buying again unless they change the formula. I'm pretty sure there's got to be a better option out there that does not involve spending $150 on a 5 gallon bag of Coca Cola syrup (which would have the high fructose corn syrup that I've been trying to avoid anyway).

review/text: We love our SodaStream and have found several of the mixes we like including the Root Beer.  It is not as good as A&W root beer but it makes a great root beer float.  It does not taste overly sweet, nor does it leave you with a chemical after taste.  Plus it is nice that you can control how much syrup you add to play with the flavor a bit.  I would recommend at least trying this syrup and definately use it for a root beer float!

review/summary: With a little doctoring, very good
review/text: This is better than diet but falls short of brand name cola taste.  I feel the cola flavor is a little "spicy" and not fruity enough. I tried a few mixin's and now I think it is great.  If it came as good as I can mix it, I would give it five stars.  If you decide to try this product, get some True Lemon or Lime, True Orange, stevia packets (with a high level, 90% or better, of steviosides for cleaner,sweeter flavor, and a bottle of cherry snow cone syrup if you like cherry cola.  I use a half packet of lemon and Orange, 1 packet of stevia, and a short squirt of cherry per liter bottle. Now the flavor falls between generic and brand name.  Cheaper than using cans, but not cheaper than using two liter bottles.  The calorie count is about a third of normal cola.  You have to be comfortable with Splenda and Ace-K as Soda Stream uses those to offset some of the sugar (not corn Syrup a plus).  Thankfully no Nutrasweet/aspartame as I get terrible headaches from that.

review/text: I chose the diet soda. Notice that the total amount of the product is not written. I was perplexed at first, but then discerned that the product image clearly says 750ml. So at $8.39 it seemed to be a decent price. However what I received was a 500ml bottle. Not worth the hassle of returning for a couple of bucks, but an annoyance none the less. So beware when you purchase. I suggest you assume that you will receive a 500ml bottle.

review/text: First thing, this does give you energy just like an energy drink. It also tastes very similar to Redbull. When I burp, it has the similar energy drink belch smell that energy drinks have for some reason. The color is not quite the same as Redbull.<br /><br />But having said all that I still find this to be an excellent value when you compare the prices of Redbull vs this mixture. At the store, Redbulls are $1.99 where as this one costs maybe $0.40 after all is said and done (cost of carbonation, syrup, shipping charged on carbonation, etc). I made that number up in my head though, did not use a calculator or even really think mathmatically about it so it is pretty much a made up cost I pulled out of the air and doesn't represent anything truthfully.<br /><br />Anyhow, I know it is a much cheaper solution, I enjoy it and am drinking some now.

review/summary: Flavors from home and childhood
review/text: The sodastream has been a real help to my family we are currently serving overseas and while there is an abundance of coke here the other flavors of soda are shall we say lacking! Some are so bitter that they are not palatable to my family. Rootbeer is a favorite and the sodastream has it nearly perfect to the rootbeer my dad made when I was young! I think that a touch more syrup is necessary to reach the true rootbeer flavor so it gets one less use for my family than the bottle says and I think there is an underlying mint flavor that is not overwhelming or unwanted but a bit noticeable to me. I did not give it 4 stars because the items arrived dented and not packed as well as I would have liked to make the journey overseas not punctured but close. It was however shipped quickly and without delay. I have not tried the diet in any flavor other than cola and with  the significantly lower sugar count in the regular probably wont but wouldnt mind hearin how they are! Thanks for shipping to us folks overseas since the sodastream site will not and where they have international sites they will only ship the flavor varieties for each country! That doesnt help much for me!

review/summary: Crown Prince Abacore Tuna
review/text: I have been ordering low mercury tuna from Amazon for some time. The last time I ran out, Amazon was not selling the brand I was buying (wild planet) so I looked for alternatives.<br /><br />I could not really find an alternative on Amazon.com that actually identified itself as "low mercury." Low mercury tuna that I could find outside Amazon.com is very expensive plus you have to pay shipping. One brand that Amazon does sell - Crown Prince - says that their tuna is Dolphin-safe and line caught. Usually, the line-caught and troll-caught tuna from the Pacific Ocean is lower in Mercury than the typical tuna you find from brands like Starkist and Chicken-of-the-Sea. I also read a story recently that the high amount of selenium in tuna actually helps bind with mercury in tuna to negate its effects.<br /><br />According to several articles I found, the interactions between dietary selenium and mercury are now the topic of exciting new research. Some of those studies were presented at a recent scientific meeting dedicated to the subject. The First International Symposium on Selenium and Mercury Interactions, was held February 22-24, 2007 in La Jolla, California. The symposium assembled scientists from the US, Japan, Spain, Ireland, Slowenia, Denmark and elsewhere to share information on selenium and mercury interactions and health effects.<br /><br />Of particular interest was a paper given by Dr. Nicholas Ralston of the Energy and Environmental Research Center in North Dakota on the biochemical basis of selenium's protective effects on mercury toxicity. Selenium has an extremely high binding attraction and strength with mercury, forming a biologically inactive compound, mercury selenide.<br /><br />But how much selenium is in tuna? All tuna species sampled, including bigeye, yellowfin, albacore and skipjack contained a healthy excess of selenium over the mercury content. For this reason, eating tuna, an excellent source of selenium, is more likely to protect against mercury toxicity, than cause it.<br /><br />So, that was enough for me to give this tuna a try. From Amazon, it comes in a 12-pack case with free shipping. The price per can is very good. The tuna tastes great and the 12-oz can is a good size for me and my wife who like to mix it with low fat miracle whip, mustard, chopped onions, and green & red peppers and eat it with corn chips or make paninis. This is good quality tuna and worth stocking in your pantry.

review/text: This review refers to Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water;No Salt(pack of 12)<br /><br />I had previously bought the Crown Prince canned salmon(also no salt added) and was very happy with it. Everything about it was good. Smelled good, looked good and tasted good. So I decided to give the Tuna a try as well. The tuna was exactly the opposite. Smelled awful, looked horrible(very dark and chunky), and wasn't good tasting at all. It wasn't that it smelled or tasted rotten or anything, just not like good quality Albacore tuna should.<br /><br />We are always on the look out for a good deal on low or no-salt items. They always run so high in the store, even for a tiny can of low-sodium tuna, you pay twice as much as one that is full of salt. These large cans came to a really good deal, and as I see from the other reviews, they enjoyed these. Maybe we got a bad batch or something, but after trying out 2 cans we know we won't buy this - or eat this - anymore.<br /><br />My husband is the one who really likes tuna. I could take or leave it(usually leaving it). He usually went through 2 cans a week of the regular tuna we bought at the store, but, even he was disappointed by this stuff.<br /><br />So I'm not recommending this not so "princely" tuna;if there is one batch of poor quality packed, there is probably others. It's too much money to throw away by taking another chance. For right now, I'll stick with the 2 cans of Star-Kist or Chicken of the Sea we buy each week at the market.<br /><br />Thanks.....Laurie

review/text: This is possibly the best albacore tuna I have every tasted.  It tastes like fresh tuna that has been cooked, not like the mush that some of the popular brands end up being.  It averages to about $5.68 per can... but consider it is a 12-oz can which is more than twice the size of most cans in the store, which are about $3.00 per 5 oz can.  I keep reordering it. My favorite ways are with tomatoes and as a tuna salad.  I like to add mayo/miracle whip, diced sweet pickles, celery seed, dill weed, onions and fresh minced garlic, and just a tad of crab boil.

Amazon has other albacore tuna for less: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KHGSI6">Polar All Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.

review/summary: Tangerine are great; watermelon are better!
review/text: These are DELICIOUS! They remind me a lot of Wonka Jaw Breakers as far as taste, but they are soft and powdery instead of hard. I prefer them over conventional candy and while they are obviously a bit more expensive they are worth every penny and you don't get that nasty sugar rush then crash that you get with conventional candies. Enjoy!! They're great!

Making this and other Knorr sauces is easier than boiling an egg. Try it, you will love it.

review/text: This is the bigger badder brother of regular tomato soup. And Campbell's is the best brand of tomato bisque I've ever had. I like it because it's creamy, sharp, sweet and has chunks of tomato in it. I don't know what else to say except that I've had this ever since I was a kid and it tastes really great. If you want to dress it up you can add some cognac or croutons in it, but other than that, it's great as is.

Unfortunately, I can't find it there any more. Checked two stores already, none to be found. So I tried Amazon and the closest match I could find. But it has very little to do with the bisque I loved so much. Now I am stuck with 11 cans I have no use for. Any suggestions?

review/summary: Delicious Alternative to Regular Potato Chips
review/text: The Good Health Humbles product line of their Natural Products is an excellent, tasty, potato chip alternative for consumers interested in eating more consciously to maintain good health.  I tried a single bag, purchased at a natural foods co-op, before deciding to splurge the 12-pack offered here on Amazon.com, and I was deliciously impressed by the taste and flavor of these chips!  This line of all natural snacks offers three taste sensations: Sesame Garlic, Olive Oil Lemon & Feta, and Roasted Red Pepper, as offered here.<br /><br />As soon as I bit into one of these chips, I knew there was no going back to regular grocery store offerings.  As someone who is trying to improve my diet, while also leaving a little wiggle room for eating healthier versions of the foods I love, Good Health Humbles fits in nicely, offering me a snack with 60% less fat than ordinary potato chips, with no cholesterol, and 3 grams of protein per serving!  When a crunchy-food craving hits, this product is something you can feel good about eating.<br /><br />For those concerned specifically about the nutritional value, I assure you this line of products is a healthier choice than your typical bag of chips: with only 4 grams of fat per serving, and 120 calories with no saturated or trans fats, this product also offers 1 gram of fiber per serving, with a only a small amount of sugar (1 gram), and a low amount of sodium (125 mg).<br /><br />Amazon.com offers a great value on these products.  As compared to the Good Health Natural Products website, Amazon.com's price is a huge enticement to shop here, when you compare it to the $30.95 you would pay for the same order directly through the company.<br /><br />After trying multiple so-called "healthier" chip options, I feel I have finally found one I fill good about eating, even when I devour the whole bag in one sitting!  ***Warning - this is  a likely occurrence once you've tasted one of these chips!***

They are not like the typical snack chip you find in the grocery store, the humbles brand is healthy yet has intense flavor, you can tell right away with the first taste that they don't have that heavy salty oily taste like some chips have.

review/text: My husband and I are big fans of hummus, so when we saw hummus chips we had to try them.  Little did we know they would become our favorite crunchy snack. The Olive oil, lemon, and feta combo is perfect - and amazing with dip, cheese, hummus, and just by themselves.<br /><br />Even better - eating a whole bag (as we often do) isn't even that bad for you.  We are both gastric bypass patients and this is something we can eat without feeling any guilt - we just enjoy it.<br /><br />In fact, we just finished off a bag of these delicious chips with a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt ranch dip (another amazing guilt free alternative).<br /><br />Highly recommend giving it a try - you'll be hooked just as we are.

They are NOT that good for you. yeah, there's no saturated fat, or cholesterol, BUT, the serving size is 3 Chips, and in that serving size, theres 4 grams of fat, and 17 grams of carbs. So I might as well be eating Frito lay chips. They market it like its health food just because they are hummus, but it's just as fattening as potato chips. I probably would not buy again....

review/text: These chips are unlike any other similar ones that we've ever tried. For starters, they are generously seasoned and taste great! There's no hunting around in the bag for the seasoned ones because every chip in the bag tastes great. The texture is crispy and is more like a traditional fried chip than a baked one, in my opinion.<br /><br />Finally, I wanted to mention that my daughter and I have j-pouches and if you have one you know the struggle it is to find foods that work with the pouch. These chips are well tolerated by both of us and don't causes any of the usual problems that we experience with most other snack foods. So this may be one snack food you might want to try if you have a j-pouch.<br /><br />Yum!

I tried eat a bag, now I don't touch em, another snack I've been contemplating bringing few with me whenever I go into city to see if homeless might want it rather than just throwing it out, at least for a snack it's on the healthier side.  But I'd kinda feel bad knowing it tastes bad, but if they're hungry they still might want it. I didn't like the crunch/texture of them, the taste, nothing really.  Just my honest opinion, I can't really say it would have been a lot different if it were one of the other flavors, but I don't think I want try them after not really even liking these a little bit. Maybe snacks can't really be too healthy and taste good.

review/text: Unlike hides, Bully sticks don't break apart into tiny, wet pieces. There is virtually no mess or staining. The bully lasts about 2 hours of straight chewing with our 1 year old Corgi. After she has been chewing on it for a while, the hard bully stick becomes soft and easier to break apart. When we want the bully stick to last longer, we will let our dog have it for 20 minutes at a time so that it only allows her to start to soften it and get a little bit off. If you wait for it to dry, it will harden again.<br /><br />This is by far the cheapest way to get the bully sticks as they range from $5-$9 a piece in stores. (Bought for $85 here on Amazon)

review/summary: don't let the cute packaging deceive, contains Blue 1 (petroleum derived) known for severe GI issues
review/text: Since Kraft Catalina Salad Dressing contains not only High Fructose Corn Syrup but also the diarrhea inducing BLUE 1 I absolutely cannot rate this product highly.  Google "blue 1 adverse reactions" for a long list of complaints. Heck even the FDA issued a press release linking this petroleum derived food color as "casually linked to fatalities." Buyer beware.<br /><br />Last week my husband came home with a bottle. After eating a very healthy salad I spent hours in agony on the toilet on an otherwise gorgeous autumn day then had to throw out the just opened bottle of toxins.  The next day we were at a luncheon where these packets of Catalina were served and sure enough these packets also contain petroleum derived FD&C Blue 1.<br /><br />I now make our own healthy "honey Catalina" using basic ingredients of water, tomato paste, apple cider vinegar, olive oil, sugar, onion, honey, sea salt, Italian seasoning, garlic, black pepper, turmeric and paprika (listed in order of quantity). I blend thoroughly and freeze the extra in 1 to 2 week supply freezer containers. You can make your own packets with a vacuum sealer or pack a small storage container of dressing to go with your salad.

review/text: See's candy is always good!  The candy we recieved through Amazon was good but not fresh.  Most pieces were starting to change to a chalk color and were dry. We were disappointed in the quality of our shipment.

review/summary: A SWEET TOOTH CANNOT BE IGNORED
review/text: To our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery gift boxes.<p>  We often take them as hostess gifts (hoping, of course, that said hostess will immediately open them and pass them around.)<p>  See's Candies hasn't disappointed us yet.

review/summary: Excellent but not outstanding chocolates
review/text: See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box.
