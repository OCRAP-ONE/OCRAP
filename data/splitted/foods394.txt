review/summary: Awesome Butter Chicken
review/text: This butter chicken is absolutely delicious,the spices are fresh and the rice is wonderful. This meal kit allows you to recreate some of the best Indian food you have ever had in your own kitchen. The instructions are clear and it is fun to put it all together and serve up to 4 adults with this product. All of the Gormantra meals I have tried have been outstanding, give it a try!

review/summary: Great and easy to make
review/text: This is very good and pretty easy to make.<br /><br />I use precooked chicken packaged chicken beast instead of raw chicken now and it cuts down on the mess and prep time a little.  I tried subsitituting 2% milk for 1/2 and 1/2 to cut down on fat and calories and while it was ok, wasn't nearly as good or creamy.  What I do know is use land of lakes low fat half and half and it comes out just as good as using regular half and half or if the store is out of the land of lakes I will use 1/2 cup half and half and 1/4 soy milk and don't notice a difference.

review/summary: Incredible Taste and Simple to Prepare
review/text: This GOURMANTRA Butter Chicken is a great meal kit. First rinse and start your basmati rice (included). All you need to add is chicken and a milk or cream or non-dairy substitute.  It's very easy to prepare, just cook the chicken in a skillet with some oil (I prefer olive it's healthier), sprinkle in the garlic/ginger spices (included), then add the butter chicken spices (included) and add the tomato puree (included) with water.  Then add some dairy or non-dairy to "cream it up" and simmer.  Couldn't be easier.<br /><br />It is a smidge more than just mild, but I love Indian food any way!  If you NEED truly mild food, this is NOT for you.<br /><br />It is healthier to make it yourself - 1) YOU get to choose how much or little oil you add (I've paid $25 for a very oily Butter Chicken at an Indian Restaurant in London that didn't beat this or a very fattening cream-based Butter Chicken in SF that could stop your heart), 2) YOU get to choose if you want to add cream with fat and cholesterol or non-fat or even non-dairy.  Yes, of course it has some affect on the taste and texture but not enough to concern my palate.<br /><br />Now, the coriander is a little stronger than some other recipes, BUT it is not ruinous or overpowering.  The garlic, ginger and turmeric are all well-balanced.  There are so many versions of Butter Chicken that you can always find something different, but this is good stuff!  The case of 6 boxes of this have a shelf life of 2 years.<br /><br />It serves 3-4 people and the aroma in my house is such an incredible bonus!  True, I have all the spices in my cabinet to make this, BUT this is TRULY an easy and simple way to make good, quality Butter Chicken!  GOURMANTRA Butter Chicken has my 5-stars!

review/text: I just tried the Butter Chicken and it is just delicious. I have tried all kinds of Indian food to make at home and have never been really pleased with the results. I have to say this is restaurant quality. I added coconut milk instead of cream and let it cook down and thicken, It is absolutely great. The spices smelled fresh, the rice is high quality,and the finished product could be served to company, The fact that it is non GMO and is gluten free makes it even better. What a treat! I do not live close to an Indian restaurant so this is doubly appreciated.

review/summary: A Gift From a Friend
review/text: This was sent to me by a friend as I had never heard of it before. She sent two of these and two of the Channa Masala. Both were very good. I tried the Butter Chicken with chicken first and it was good. The instructions said that you could use lamb also so I tried that the second time and it was better. I haven't had good Indian food in a while, but this was so much better than going to a restaurant. We ate it at home while watching monday night football and even my son was taken back and he's pretty picky. Good stuff!

review/summary: A staple meal in my kitchen pantry!
review/text: I LOVE Gourmantra's Butter Chicken.  I've tasted several varieties of Butter Chicken in the past, including those from high-end authentic Indian restaurants.  The combination of spices, garlic, and tomato sauce included in this kit are every bit as tasty as those, and in some cases much better!  I highly recommend this particular product!  I actually crave it and prepare it twice a month.  Very easy to prepare, and it also tastes wonderful the next day.  All you need on hand is chicken and cream, toss together a salad and voila!

review/summary: Amazing, never going out to eat Indian Food again
review/text: This was my favorite dish at an Indian Restaurant. As far as the strong clove taste, there is a very distinct taste that's strong. It's not bad, it's just really powerful. I made it for dinner the other night with some store-bought naan and everything cost about $10, and my brother mom and myself couldn't finish all the food. We're big eaters.<br /><br />My tip is to put a tablespoon or two of tomato paste in the sauce after adding the tomato puree. I think it was missing some sweetness and acidity that I'm used to. This mix is actually very wonderful. If you go to an Indian Restaurant, you get half as much butter chicken for $15-$20.<br /><br />Everything was done in 30 minutes, it was a very quick and flavorful meal.

review/summary: A lot of fudge!
review/text: I first ordered a pound from another vendor, but it just didn't last. This 6 lb. fudge brick is sure lasting a long time! I even have to share it with my 2 kids. I store it in the fridge and it keeps just fine. It is sweet, fresh and fudgy. This might be a little more than you need, but a pound is just not enough.<br /><br />Imagine my shock when I opened the box after it arrived and found...a whole case of peppered gravy packets! The warehouse screwed up and sent my 6 lbs. of fudge to Iowa and I got someone in Iowa's case of gravy mix. So I had to wait to receive my fudge. But I finally did.<br /><br />It's yummy. No nuts.

review/summary: yummy pineapple & mango flavor........
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this....10 calories per bottle and it has a great taste, a pineapple and mango blend that is oh so delicious.  It is flavored with sucrolose, which to me does not have the diet after taste that many other sweetners have.  I would definitely purchase this drink again and would now try more in the fuze line now that I know how good they are!  As an aside, I bet this would make some pretty good skinny cocktails with a splash of your favorite adult mix-in.<br /><br />Overall, no complaints here, delicious without being too sweet or too plain, a nice blend with a pineapple base to it and absolutely do-able for 10 calories per bottle!

review/summary: Bring a screw driver
review/text: While it looks like this might be the current vaccum sealed lunch to go, it is in fact the older small can. While the the product itself - tuna, mayo, crakers, etc - are fine, the container is unbelevably hard to open. This is  not the normal flip top can, but a "new" design that simply does not work. I'm a big guy, and I need a screw driver to actually open the damn thing - the lid and pull tab do not give enough torque to actually remove the lid without breaking the pull tab - or your finger. The top of the can says - in vey large letters around the pull top: "OR USE CAN OPENER" - but the lid is so recessed that a conventional can opener will not work, and the bottom of the can is too rounded.  Just make sure you are at least a big guy and have your own screw driver to get what you paid for!

review/text: The item in the photo is the flat cardboard "Lunch-To-Go" kit that includes CHUNK LIGHT tuna, butter crackers, mayo, and pickle relish.  The product that I received are the round kits containing ALBACORE tuna and wheat crackers.  I strongly prefer the chunk light tuna to the albacore, and in fact, chose to order these from Amazon because my local grocer has stopped carrying the chunk light kits.  Needless to say, I'm not happy about receiving something different than I ordered, different than what is pictured.

review/text: I bought these for my kids' lunches, having had them before over the years.  They really are yummy, but there's one huge problem - the new "safer" packaging (top is not as sharp) is nearly impossible to open.  End result - my kids ended up skipping lunch!  My husband, the engineer, says he loves them, but you "need a screwdriver or tool to open them."<br /><br />So, buyer beware!  Unless Starkist changes its packaging, I won't be buying these again.

I am throwing them all in the trash. I had previously purchased a 12 pack of Amore Anchovy paste and had them in my pantry for nearly two years as I used them all without any issue.  I will stay away from Crown Prince.  My packages say Imported From Morocco.

review/summary: Company doesn't know how to ship food.
review/text: Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.  The links showed up rancid, so I refused the order (but they also took TWO+ WEEKS TO SHIP THIS NIGHTMARE, and made my whole experience the worst I have had w/Amazon in 8 years).<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.  The order showed up 5 DAYS BEFORE THIS DID.  But they're not incompetent--not if you talk to them!

But NOT organic!  Not so wonderful.  I contacted Amazon & my money was refunded.  I rated this with 4 stars because of it's Fair Trade certification.  Fair trade means labors get paid a fair wage for their work.  Many don't & get mere change a day for 18 hours of labor.  If you have a choice between fair trade or not fair trade, please choose fair trade.  Yes, it usually costs more but it's the right thing to do.  I feel it's kind of like giving to charity.  Frontier makes wonderful spices & are worth checking out if your interested!

review/text: OK, this is a great price on organic vanilla extract, normally it would cost twice, maybe even three times as much.  But, it is not orgainic!  Look carefully at the picture.  The label for the Frontier organic vanilla is red at the top with the word "Organic" written on it.  This bottle has a label that is gold at the top with the words "All Natural" written on it.  The left side of the orgainic bottle has the USDA orgainic seal on it, this bottle does not.  Without the certification seal, a product is not certified organic.  The bubble-wrap that the bottle comes in has a white label with the words "Frontier Organic Fair Trade Certified Vanilla Extract", on it, but anyone can make one of those.  Since Amazon refuses to refund my money, not because I am late, but because for some undisclosed reason this vanilla is "not eligable" for return, I am stuck with it.  Don't let this happen to you!!!!

review/text: I have trouble finding falafil mix in my local stores, so I was very happy to see this available on Amazon.  Casbah mix (my favorite) is quicker to prepare -- absorbs water for 10 minutes rather than 30 for Ziyad, but Ziyad seems to make more falafil per package.  It tastes great deep fried, and pretty good baked.  Just spray the baking pan with non-stick spray, then spray the patties and bake at 375 til done.  Much lower in calories and fat, terrific with sesame Tahini and hummus.  The package also contains recipes for low-carb breaded chicken and vegetarian chili using the mix.

review/summary: My Wife Loooooooves it.
review/text: I took a chance; it was the first time I tried a kit wine ( I make mine from fuit etc.).  This wine is sooo good my wife and I were constantly testing it before it was finished clarifing.  It makes 6 gallons but after all the tasting we only were able to bottle about 4 gallons.  This is great fruity tasting and refreshing wine.  If you don't want your kit I'll buy it from you.  Our stock is running low.

review/text: My wife and I made this kit and it is extremely simple to make. We added 2 lbs of dextrose to the primary and aged it for 2 months. I was pleasantly surprised when we tried this on bottling day. It is sweet and fruity, plus it had the ABV that we were hoping for. I highly recommend this kit.

review/summary: Amazing fruity wine
review/text: I usually purchase wine kits from the local winery but thought I'd take a chance considering the price difference and boy was I glad I did. The wine is absolutely delicious... I have been making lots of different varieties for my upcoming wedding and will have to buy more of this as it will not make it till the wedding. I am subscribing for sure!!!! The labels are great and you just can't go wrong with the price. I am about to bottle the Moscato and have the Strawberry White Merlot in fermenting right now... Give it a try you will not be disappointed!!!

review/summary: Very enjoyable wine
review/text: We prefer a sweeter dessert type wine and all the Cornucopia kits we have done (and we have made several) have proven to be to our liking. Sweet wines with very good flavors. We also enjoy the lower alcohol content these kits tend to have and that they don't over power the flavor. If you like a bit more alcohol, it's easy to boost that with a little corn sugar when you start.<br /><br />Having done a number of kits now, it's hard to beat the price on the Cornucopia kits. Other kits don't include corks, labels and foil wraps and are more expensive. Another bonus for us has been time. The Cornucopia kits are done and ready to bottle well within the 4 week time while "other brand" kits have run longer than the 4 weeks to bottling.

review/text: This was the first wine that I've made as a beginning wine maker.  The instructions were clear and even though I didn't follow them exactly to a "T", the wine turned out fantastic.  It might be a little sweet for some people but it's wonderful for me and my wife.  We gave a bottle to our next door neighbor who makes his own wine from grapes that he buys from Napa Valley and he and his wife love it- (they are real italians!).  I'm going to buy more of these.  Just so you know, you need to already have some basic wine equipment.  I mistakenly thought it came with the carboys, hoses, etc...  it comes w/ labels, seals, corks and all the ingredients, but that is it.  Still, a great price for 27 bottles of wine that taste delicious!

I have to admit before I bought this kit, i didn't realize you also need to purchase all of the necessary wine making equipment.  I really like the fact that the kit includes all the ingredients for the wine in addition to the corks, labels, and sleeves for the bottle necks so that the finished product looks very professional and can be given as gifts, some of the more expensive wine kits from other manufacturers do not include those extra items.

I really don't like the aftertaste associated with "diet" products--and I really cannot detect any in True Lemon drinks...it just tastes like lemonade!  It comes in those little packets like another well known crystal diet drink.  This is really convenient because you can carry it around in your purse-dump it in your waterbottle, make individual servings or, if you like, make a pitcher-full.  I like the raspberry one the best-can't wait to try their iced tea mix.

It's so yummy this tea tastes just like a candy cane! And since it's decaf I can drink this anytime of the day! My local grocery store was selling these so I bought a few boxes to last me through winter! But the more cups I drank the more I loved it! I went back to back to the grocery store to stock up year round but they were already sold out :( I'm so glad I can still get this on Amazon! I highly recommend this tea if your a candy cane/peppermint fan! :)

review/summary: High Quality
review/text: There is a lot of variability in the quality of macadamians, even from the same producer.  I've only received one bag of these, but they are perfect.  I've run across many that have had varying degrees of bitterness, usually accompanied by an unnaturally hard consistency, as though they had been harvested too early.  Not these.  They have perfect consistency and flavor.  The vast majority are whole as opposed to halves or smaller pieces.  [Update:  I've now ordered about 8 bags over a period of about a year.  The quality has be consistently excellent.}<br /><br />I use macadamia nuts as a regular part of my diet.  They preferentially reduce bad cholesterol due to their high content of monounsaturated fats.  They are low in carbs, and have very few simple carbs, so they will not only take the edge off your appetite, they will help keep it off.  Unlike most nuts, they are low in oxalate, which means regular use will not increase the risk of kidney stones.  (Pistachios and walnuts are also low in oxalate.)  The only catch is that their high healthy fat content means high calorie count per unit volume.  To dodge that bullet, I just ration them out as opposed to absentmindedly eating from a large container.<br /><br />This is a great product.  I'm happy to give them yet another 5-star review.

review/text: I've tried a lot of macadamias and these are, by far, the freshest and best-tasting of them all.  It'll cost you a little more, but it's worth it. The downside is the fact that they're always running out of stock.  I've read many posts outside of Amazon referencing these nuts and they're quality, so it's not like the market isn't there.  That being said, if you're not addicted to mac nuts it won't drive you crazy; just pick them up when you see them.  Maybe it's a marketing ploy, like the whole "tickle-me elmo" fiasco a while back, but that's a conspiracy for another day.

review/text: These are the best macadamias I've had! The right hardness with a crunchy start and soon after a feeling of them melting away in your mouth :) Great flavor, with no bitterness, excessive oil-ness, etc. And as if that wasn't enough, they're unsalted! That means you're not only getting more healthful nuts, but also getting to taste the real nut (rather than a whole bunch of salt). And the price seems good too (although I haven't really comparison-shopped).

review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.

review/text: These cookies are fabulous. Flaky, not too sweet, fluffy not gooey layers. Small but not too small. Suggested serving size of 6 is good. Lots of things these days have completely unrealistic serving sizes. I know they have sat fat but I really don't care. I have been unable to find anything like them. They remind me of REAL bakery cookies.

Chocolate and orange are an addictive combination.  There are other brands out there of these sponge cookies, but the Bahlsen brand is by far tops in the quality of the ingredients used.

review/summary: Amazingly light & Delicately sweet
review/text: The first time had these cookies was when I visited NYC.  One box of these cost me around $7, so when I found these on amazon.com for about $1.40 per box, I was so exstatic!  I could eat an entire box without feeling full of sugar or guilt.  Perfect with tea as I am not a coffee fan.  There are several reviews that I have read that were complaining about the number of boxes they received (12)- it says right in the product title how many boxes come in the order!  Do people really not read anymore then turn around and have the gall to give a bad review just because out of pure stupidity they failed to read what they were actually ordering?  I am appaled by some people's idiocy until I remind myself that I live in the United States.  Besides, why would anyone complain at $1.40 per box?  I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone, I would give 10 stars if I could.  Oh, and be glad they come in shipments of 12 boxes, they will be gone before you know it!  Thank you, Amazon!

review/text: My husband and I have been buying these cookies locally for years because we love them so much; they are far better than the milk chocolate version (but then, we love DARK chocolate!). In the past couple of years, our local grocer has stopped carrying them, we would request them, they would get them for a few months, and then they would stop carrying them again. I am so glad to see that I can get them via amazon.com! These are wonderful cookies with warm milk, cold milk, or a little Scotch . . . mmmmmmm!

review/text: These are positively the most delicious cookies ever--smooth milk chocolate covering meringue biscuits.  However, when we received them--albeit in the Texas summer--they were fused together in the packaging. They are now not only less attractive, but also hard to eat.  So I would not recommend ordering these in the summer with the way they are packaged by Amazon.

review/summary: YUM- like a perfect Rice Crispy
review/text: If Rice Crispy bars were made with good chocolate, and didn't taste like wax, they might taste like this.  Wow- What a yummy treat.  These are coated with a LOT of chocolate, and for me are more like a candy than a cookie (and I don't have a problem with that!)  I would not have wanted to order them in the summer, because I feel sure they would have melted.  The chocolate taste is wonderful, and I love the crunchiness.  The Sell By date is not until 9/2010 a full 8 months from today (1/21/2010), so I'm pleased with their freshness.  I don't think they will last very long in our house, but still, it's nice they are fresh.  These are packed very well, so they should not arrive crumbled or damaged in any way.  My cookies are perfect.  If you like crunchy chocolate treats this is for you!  Delicious!

review/summary: Great- and good Sell By date
review/text: I'll start with something really important to me- the sell by date.  I bought these cookies in January of 2010, and they are good until 9-2010, which is important to me, since I hate eating rancid food, so I just throw it out.  I've always loved these cookies, and my market sells them for much more than the subscribe price, so I'm happy to subscribe and save.  I love currants, and it's hard to find things flavored with them.  I have to admit, the currant taste is not strong, but they are delicious anyway, and I love the puff pastry.  Further, I'm allergic to GMO corn starch (genetically modified corn starch)- and just try to find cookies in US stores without corn starch (and 95% of all corn is modified in the US, and does not have to be labeled so).  So these are a real treat for me- since they are a cookie I can actually eat.<br /><br />The cookies are flaky, as puff pastry always is, and slightly sweet.  As other people have said, this is not a terribly sweet cookie, but it is quite sweet enough.  I enjoy mine with tea, and I also take them in my lunch.  If you take them in your lunch, put them in a little box- because they ARE delicate, and you might end up with delicious crumbs if you don't protect them.  I know this because I squashed them once.

review/text: These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.  The whole wheat is especially good with green and pouchong teas - though predictably satisfying paired with a cup of Assam or English Breakfast. Also great with cocoa or milk, cheese or apples.... a slather of peanut butter..... !<br /><br />They're one of the few biscuits I'd definitely offer to children.

review/summary: Good with coffee
review/text: These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.  There is more air in the cookie, so when you dip it in coffee, it becomes saturated rather quickly and the cookie folds into your mouth, with the sweet center taking center stage.  Nuff said.
