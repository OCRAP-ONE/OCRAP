review/summary: more affordable version of Artisana
review/text: I lust for Artisana coconut butter. I use it like peanut butter on toast, in oatmeal in the morning, even out of the jar although it's so rich it can be sickening like that (learned the hard way :). Anyway I saw this and it looked like the Artisana at almost half the price. So it's not raw, which is likely why that one is more expensive, but it tastes just as good and makes my wallet happy.<br />To the reviewers who were disappointed - it's definitely NOT like coconut oil, you MUST stir it up, it's a very versatile product to use as a replacement. I foresee ordering more in the future.

review/summary: So what is coconut manna?
review/text: So, the minute I found out that there was something called coconut manna, I couldn't sleep thinking about it!  There is so LITTLE information about it online, as to what "manna" truly was that I just had to try it for myself. Well, first what is it?  It's basically mashed up/ground coconut "meat". It has the consistancy of peanut butter that has been slightly melted.  It is also a little gritty too.<br /><br />I was under the impression that it was sweet but it's not.  It is as sweet as unsweetened coconut mash would be.  I was misled by other reviewers that said that it was soooo delicious and they eat it straight from the jar.  I wouldn't do that.  It's just plain boring.  BUT...I think it's the kind of product that would work well in a recipe that called for coconut flavor or texture like cookies, cakes, smoothies, and frostings.  But just to repeat, IT IS NOT SWEET LIKE PEANUT BUTTER!<br /><br />I rate it a 5 out of 10. If you have a sweet tooth like me, this is not the product for you.  If you just need an authentic coconut spread, you've got it.  PLEASE NOTE:  It may be too hard to eat at first.  In that case, warm the jar in boiled water for 15 minutes, stir with a butter knife, and let the "ok" times roll!

review/summary: An Aquired Taste
review/text: This is a decent product, but I have a lot of texture issues.  The flavor is light and buttery, but not as sweet as I expected.  The sweetness was almost imperceptible.<br /><br />The previous reviews concerning manna were true in that the product does separate.  Re-mixing for was not a problem.<br /><br />The texture issues are that when eating it raw the initially it is smooth and creamy, but soon becomes thick and grainy.  The graininess makes it difficult for me to eat it off a spoon.<br /><br />I have tried mixing it in vegetables and curries and you can still get hints of the graininess.  The product also will solidify after it cools despite using it in cooked a dish.

review/summary: The manna is quite good, but what a royal pain to use - if you live in cold weather areas, order this in summer
review/text: Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round.

review/summary: Great Product, Super in Glass, Must Be Mixed
review/text: ****<br />This Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna is actually a type of coconut cream or coconut butter NOT coconut oil. The difference is that the cream or butter is much thicker, has whole coconut in it, and a very strong coconut flavor. You would not use the coconut manna for cooking. It is used more as a spread (which you wouldn't usually do with coconut oil) or can even be eaten by itself or made into a candy (because it is slightly sweet). It can be added to smoothies or used in many other creative ways. Think of it like whole coconut meat in a creamy form.<br /><br />The reason I did not give this coconut manna five stars is because it is hard to actually use. In order to mix the ingredients, which do separate at most normal room temperature, the container must be heated gradually to a very warm room temperature (say 80 degrees, I'd think, or even higher) or else put in hot water for 30 minutes, stirred, and left in hot water for 30 more minutes. Nutiva just began offering this Coconut Manna in this glass jar instead of the previous plastic tub, which is a huge improvement. Still, it is so hard to get it to a consistency in which it can be mixed! I tried heating it in the microwave on the lowest setting (do not do this!) but no matter what I did it would suddenly burn. It's best to start an hour or more ahead of time and just do the hot water prep.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a great product. It is very slightly sweet and tastes strongly like coconut. The consistency is a bit gritty or grainy due to part of the coconut flesh that is powder and has been reconstituted, but I found that fine, not off-putting at all. It's great all by itself, added to smoothies, or put into the freezer in molds for a whole foods raw candy.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****

review/text: I love coconut oil for cooking, skin care and mixing with other foods, like peanut butter, so I thought I would love coconut manna.  I looked forward to getting my shipment.  After tasting the coconut manna I have to say I was very disappointed.  It didn't have a strong coconut taste and had what I would describe as an unpleasant consistency.  Not sure what I will do with what I have left.  May just heat it and take the oil out or just put it in smoothies.

review/text: This is just powdered tomato. No additives. The nutrition facts listed above are accurate.

Take care of your blood pressure: Eat less sodium!<br /><br />Now for the best part: According to its Web site, Frontier is an outstandingly socially and environmentally responsible company. The package in which my product was shipped consists of 100% recycled materials, sourced locally (in Iowa), and printed with soy ink. The packing peanuts are the kind that dissolve in hot water.<br /><br />This matters to me folks. I will certainly buy more products from this company.

review/summary: Delicious, refreshing Ginger Drink
review/text: I have been happily drinking Reed's Raspberry Ginger Brew for years. The taste is slightly tart and very fruity with overtones of ginger flavor. The ginger is great for indigestion or nausea. One bottle is approximately 110 calories and unlike many drinks it is not overly sweetened but has a natural flavor.<br /><br />Price wise I'm not sure this is a good deal as I buy it locally for $1.25 per bottle or around $4.75 for a 4-pack. Amazon needs to seriously adjust their price unless it has been bumped up to include about $12-$14 worth of shipping charges.

My only advice is---Buy directly from Reed's for the best products, DO NOT buy it from Amazon. The batch I received was old, filthy & dusty, with the labels falling off and the tops were bulging and exploding from age. I threw them all away for fear of them being outdated & rotten. Beware.

review/summary: Good for my cats!
review/text: I love my cats. For many years I fed them the cheaper brands of cat food.  It was not until I had a cat diagnosed with heart disease that I found out more information about feline nutrition.  Basically, protein is very important (it's what they would be eating if they were in the wild) and grains can be hard for them to digest.  Since that time, I've tried to do better in making sure they get the proper nutrition to keep them as healthy as possible.<br /><br />Science Diet has a new line of cat food available called Ideal Balance.  It features fresh chicken as the first ingredient, fruits and veggies as secondary ingredients and is free of corn, artificial flavors and preservatives.  It is conveniently available in the Kitten, Adult and Mature Adult varieties.<br /><br />When I gave my cats this dry food, they enthusiastically ate it. This is actually nothing new. They do that with all cat food. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find that as the days went by and they continued eating the food, there was less throwing up from one of our cats who apparently has a sensitive stomach.  I have no doubt the switching of brands is what caused her throwing up to lessen.  Although Science Diet does cost more than other brands you can find in the big box stores, the higher price is worth it to be able to give my cats good nutrition.<br /><br />Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a bag of Science Diet Ideal Balance Cat Food free via BzzAgent. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR, Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising."

review/text: Being completely ignorant of wine and all things associated, this Sommelier gift set seemed a little over the top. Previously, I found the basic corkscrew awkward and accident prone. I was impressed with the power corkscrew and found it had the power that was needed. With a little practice, the unit was quick and easy to use; I would especially recommend this unit for anyone lacking hand strength or suffering with joint pain. The second unit allowes the user to vacuum seal an opened, partially used bottle of wine. At this point I have not had the occasion to use the vacuum but it does complete the set, making the price even more reasonable and a great gift.

review/text: I came across this gum at Vitamin World and was immediately thrilled to know a product like this exists. I cannot have aspartame product bcuz it can trigger my seizures. I was sad to find every chewing gum I used to enjoy contained aspartame which pretty much ended my chewing gum habit and my choice of a breath freshener now is Altoids since they are the only mint that tastes good and is aspartame-free. But when I found this gum I was happy I could go back to chewing gum. Flavor wise it tastes ok but doesn't last very long. I wish they would consider making all chewing gums with a Aspartame-free option. But if you can't have Aspartame like me then try this gum. It's a great substitute. Hint : Take an Altoid mint and this gum at the same time for flavor boost.

review/summary: Great Product - Compares Favorably to Competitors
review/text: I purchased the 10 pack of this product from a local store for the following reasons (which is why I have rated this product highly):<br /><br />1. It contains more bio-available forms of certain vitamins and minerals (for instance, C is included in zinc ascorbate and chromium ascobate forms)<br />2. It does NOT contain aspartame or sucralose like Airbourne; instead, it uses stevia.<br />3. It contains no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives.<br />4. It contains 1000IU of vitmain D3 and does not include a potentially dangerous level of vitamin A palimate (like Airbourn)<br /><br />Overall, compared to similar products, it offers superior quality in terms of vitamin/mineral content at a cheaper price.

review/summary: Very Good Supplement
review/text: I am deployed and live in close quarters and work in close contact with people 24/7. I began taking this two weeks ago on a daily basis in hopes of thwarting any kind of sickness. So far, so good. I'v also noticed a decrease in congestion recently - there is A LOT of dust and dirt in the air, and I was waking up with a sinus headache every day. I think this is helping with it.<br /><br />It tastes fine, is easy to take, convenient, and price isn't bad, so I will continue to take this year-round.

review/summary: Best sea salt I've found so far...
review/text: I love this sea salt! It has the smoothest flavor of any that I've tried so far, and I've tried quite a few.  There is no sharp bite or bitter aftertaste.  It enhances the flavor in a subtle , yet robust way.  What I love most about this salt is the texture-- it is light and flaky, but still offers a nice crunch and burst of flavor in your mouth.  It does not automatically dissolve on contact with the food and looks very attractive on the plate.  It's beautiful on top of chocolates at the end of a meal, too.  I do generally prefer the "wet" sea salts, but when you combine the flavor and texture of Maldon's salt it functionally exceeds any of the salts out there.

review/text: The sound of this cereal just screams deliciousness, two of my most favorite things in a breakfast cereal, nothing more exciting then that.  I was holding my breath as I bought this cereal, not setting high expectations for a kellogs cereal but was I surprised in a good way.  Loaded with flavor of cinnamon on crunchy flakes and pecans in every bite.  Usually when you get a cereal that says there are nuts in it you have to search for them, but in this cereal they are in every spoonful, and they are no small dinky nuts either, they are a nice size to satisfy that nut flavor.  There are so many different textures going on and flavors as well from crunchy corn, cinnamon, buttery tasting pecans, so delicious.  I hope that this cereal sticks around because it has to be one of kellogs masterpieces for sure.

Now I keep some in my kitchen at all times!<br /><br />Unlike a typical "tea" this is more of a granulated drink, tasting similar to apple juice or cider.  I love to put a couple tablespoons in a cup of hot water to soothe a cold, stomach upset, sore throat... (I think it's the vitamin C)  or just to warm up on a chilly day.<br /><br />Hot or cold it is a healthy, delicious drink.

review/summary: Not the treat of yesteryear, that's for sure.
review/text: Thinking I'd be wickedly clever and get a fun treat -- one that's vegan and also contains fiber, hee hee -- into my kids and the rest of the unsuspecting Trick-or-Treaters this year, I ordered a bunch of these bulk boxes of Cracker Jack bags for distribution last Halloween.<br /><br />What a disappointment, in two ways.<br /><br />1. My suspicion is that, unlike the 1970s and 80s when I was a kid and enjoyed these, modern food science has now created a popcorn scanner that sees inside each popped kernel to find out whether it has popped fully or incompletely-- incompletely meaning a hard stone part lurks inside.  If the latter is ascertained, it gets routed onto the Cracker Jack bag-filling line.  I'd say a good half or more of the popped corns in the bags we received contained an unchewable hard part.<br /><br />2. I strongly suspect attorneys seeking to limit settlements by Cracker Jack, Inc. to parents whose children found a way to harm themselves with yesterday's prizes like plastic spinners and "moving" pictures have mandated that all Cracker Jack prize designers limit their creations to "paper only" models.  They were undoubtedly encouraged to do so by some MBA whiz (most likely a Harvard Business School graduate) who also realized how cheap and lightweight paper is to manufacture, thereby saving on both production and shipping costs, in addition to settlement fees.<br /><br />The unfortunate result is that, unlike the actually fun prizes I remember (a few of which, I am embarrassed to say, I still have packed away somewhere), today's children can look forward to Cracker Jack prizes like paper pencil toppers (two slits and put on the end of that pencil -- wow!) and -- I kid you not -- "arrange the face of Abe Lincoln" or "turn the young face into the elderly Susan B. Anthony" activities.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; I love the Abolitionists and Suffragettes, and Susan B. Anthony, having the honor of being among both camps, is my favorite among them. I will also add that my self-righteous pride expanded as I realized I was distributing to neighborhood children lessons about American historical figures along with a vegan, fiber-containing snack, all masquerading as a Halloween treat.<br /><br />But the Cracker Jacks that children love are gone.  Mine, who are in 1st and 4th grade, won't even eat the leftover bags, and so I started eating them myself-- except I couldn't force myself to chew through all those hard kernels. And when I tossed my kids the prizes, they said, "no, thanks."<br /><br />I write this not to deride a classic treat but to beseech the powers-that-be at Cracker Jack to restore their product to the quality of its glory days, when hard kernels weren't plentiful and the prizes were worth finishing your bag or box for.  Arise, Crack Jack, to this challenge, and reclaim your rightful place in American childhood!

review/summary: Cracker Jacks. Just Like The Old Days.
review/text: A couple weeks ago I spotted some bags of Cracker Jacks at my local Fresh and Easy Market. I was amused in that it brought back old memories of how we used to eat Cracker Jacks as kids. I bought a bag and enjoyed the nice and crispy carmelized corn and peanuts. Then a couple days ago, I spotted some 24-bag cartons of Cracker Jacks at my nearby Costco Store. Hmmmm. What is this a Cracker Jack revival? In any case, I picked up a 24-bag (1.25 oz ea.) box of Cracker Jacks with the idea that I could use them as snacks or for lunches and for my little boy to enjoy. Supposedly, they have a little toy in each bag, just as they did in the old days, but the only toys I've found so far are some paper stickers, not like the things in the old days. Oh well, it's probably just as well. I can easily visualize my little boy swallowing those little metal or plastic gadgets that they used to have. In any case, these bags are quite good. Nice and fresh. Very handy. I hope my little boy likes them as well as I used to or I'm going to have a lot of lunch materials.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Superior alternative to white rice
review/text: Tamaki short grain rice is available in different varieties.  This particular variety is brown.  ANY rice not white is brown,<br />even black and red. The distinction is not truly one of color, it references bran.  White rice is white because the bran (the best,<br />most healthful part of the rice grain) is removed completely.  What makes the Tamaki Haiga type of rice so desirable is that the<br />grain itself is just as light as a white rice would be AND it still has the bran germ intact.  This difference makes for an incredible<br />difference in taste.  Where white rice (with perhaps the exception of Basmati) is largely bland and flavorless and requires spices, herbs<br />and or fats to make it worth your while, Tamaki Haiga has the bran AND the flavor.  Oh and although it is a short grain variety, (which being<br />thicker also takes longer to cook than white) it does cook in much shorter time than the average brown rice.<br /><br />If you are eating this rice and not noticing a real difference in flavor (it should have a noticeable nutty flavor)then perhaps you are not preparing<br />it properly.  Contrary to the average white rice it does require soaking.  I have found that after proper rinsing soaking my haiga for 30 minutes<br />or so before turning my rice cooker on leads to a perfectly moist and flavorful dish.<br /><br />Remember also, this is a sushi type rice and is meant to be moist and sticky as opposed to the firm and easily separated texture of the average white rice.<br />This truly is a superior rice product and JVS has proven to be a reliable distributor.  They deliver fresh product, well packaged and on time.  I agree that<br />the price for this rice is a bit high but this vendor makes it available at a much cheaper price than some others. And don't forget that the shipping that they are<br />charging is seriously discounted.  All in all a very good deal for rice that is actually good for you AND really good tasting as well.  I am Costa Rican and<br />I eat rice every day.  This is not the rice I grew up but it is an integral part of get healthy diet now.

review/summary: Great rice, why has haiga doubled in price?
review/text: This is a nice compromise between white and brown rice.  Some people call it brown and it isn't.  It is white with a little bran left, actually the germ.<br /><br />I think it might be a little better than consuming totally white rice and the taste is fine so I like using it.  However, the price doubled from the last time I got it (not just here, it is hard to find on net and I don't have a lot of asian stores here to look into)<br /><br />It is grown in California and if Calrose, etc, hasn't experienced some price doubling disaster I don't know why this has.<br /><br />But the rice itself is perfectly fine and perhaps a little better than straight white.

review/text: For Ramen noodles, this product was middle quality. The price was good, on the first shipment. There are minor QC issues with the packaging, soup base envelope, and other minor quibbles, but, once I was on the 'monthly' delivery, the price was jacked up $9 and then $14 or $16 depending on who did the subtraction...<br /><br />They called the money out of my account well before requested delivery date (and they say that they only 'hold' it, pending shipment... Had they waited 6 hours, it would still have been too damned early, But, I would not have known about it, Until I checked the bank...<br /><br />Well, that process could have caused checks to bounce, and my feeling is, if I say ship no sooner than one date, keep your hands off my account until that date... (You should have heard the stories and excuses for that one.)<br /><br />I have dealt with Amazon Customer Service before... The people in those instances were great!! And I praised them for their service and care...<br /><br />I hate besmirching them with this go round. In the many calls It took to resolve the issue, the group of 'reps' had a problem with the difference between day of week and date of month, did their best to keep me from talking to a supervisor, a supervisor started talking to someone in their room, one second after the 'hold' music stopped, with the sentence 'he hung up, huh?'...(ooops, forgot the 'click))...<br /><br />I have canceled delivery because a $16 price jump in 28 days, and the service trying to resolve the issue... sounded like the lies the media spreads about many other subjects. Actually, a supervisor canceled it, then a few minutes later I canceled it (twice); and I was asked to call them back... and the chap on the line that time queried me about if I wanted the order canceled... sigh....<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed...<br /><br />(watch this one get pulled)<br /><br />If you can get the product, at the original price I was quoted on February 3, 2011... It is an ok deal...<br /><br />The price they had it raised to by Feb 24, was borderline ok...<br /><br />The price on February 28th was past reasonable...<br /><br />The price for the next shipment (which I saw March 3rd) was crazy...<br /><br />Noodles have not gone up that much over the last 20 years...<br /><br />They did it in 28 days??

review/summary: Unique product, tastes good, and it works!
review/text: I know this candy is expensive, but it does what it says it will, which is a big deal for me.  This candy is actually sort of a life-changing product for me, and I'm so excited it's available in the US now.<br /><br />I sweat easily and profusely.  It's an embarrassing problem, but this candy makes it much less so.  I shower and use underarm deodorant, obviously, which helps the situation there, but the rest of me sweats too... just a general moistness of the skin all over, which often has a somewhat sour smell.  Yuck.  I'm always the first one in any group to start to sweat if it's warm or we're doing something vigorous.  Usually this leaves me feeling really self-conscious and I will stand apart, etc.  I've even avoided certain activities with friends during the summer because I knew this would happen.  For this candy to help me, I just eat a few pieces an hour or two in advance! Then, when I start to get warm my skin will give off a subtle lovely smell instead of the usual sour smell.  I can't tell you how excited I am about this!  Also, a side bonus, it has a nice effect on the breath that lasts longer for me than any breath mint I've ever used.<br /><br />Maybe it's just the way it reacts with my own body chemistry, but I don't think it smells particularly like roses, or even flowery... it's hard to explain, it's just a subtle clean & fresh smell that comes through my skin.  You know how some people just smell good, not like product, but just like a nice skin smell?  That's what this does for me.  A friend of mine ate some and I thought she smelled more flowery, more reminiscent of roses, though not quite.  I'd expect it's going to smell a little different on everyone.<br /><br />Oh, and since it's a candy, I should probably mention:  It's delicious!  The very first taste when you pop it in your mouth is a little "rosey", meh, but that is almost immediately replaced by a very nice tangy tangerine flavor.  I have to keep myself from eating them all up so I'll have them when I need them.  :)  I buy the regular sugar-sweetened kind, since I don't use artificial sweeteners, so I can't comment on the taste of the sugar-free ones.

review/summary: Fantastic for Doggies with Digestive Issues!!!
review/text: I have a 12-year-old corgi that is my baby, and part of that has involved years of butt wiping, unfortunately.  About six months ago, I decided to put him on a limited ingredient diet (no corn, no wheat), and he got a lot better--it's almost like he has corgi IBS, so it took a limited diet to help him get better.<br /><br />But, the thing that finally made him consistently normal, with no intestinal sickness, was adding this.  It has oat fiber and pre-biotics which help grow better gut flora.  This is the only treat he gets, now.  Literally, there's no more icky poo.

review/summary: Tastes like quality regular pasta, but more fiber and less "sleepiness" after
review/text: I've been using Dreamfields pasta for about a year and a half now. It's become a kitchen staple for us. I bought it to help keep my sugar under control while still enjoying pasta dishes. My husband, a very finicky eater, didn't even notice it was high-fiber (well, until he got a bit gassy later). Tastewise, this is just as good as regular, quality pasta. (And not gritty like whole wheat ones can be.)<br /><br />A very nice product, and a boon to those watching their sugar numbers. I'll add that I don't get the super-sleepiness after eating this pasta that I used to eating regular pasta (you know, that post-carb napping syndrome).<br /><br />I've used the penne, the linguine, the elbow (for mac'n'cheese) and the lasagna (for veggie and regular lasagne casseroles). Great. All of them.<br /><br />Thumbs up flavorwise.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it seems pricey for pasta, but buying in bulk with no shipping fees helps until my local stores carry it.

review/text: I've used Dreamfields lasanga before, so I know it's a great product.  I bought a case of lasagna because I can't get it locally.  It's cheaper to buy it through Amazon (free shipping) than direct from the company.  I am disappointed that many pieces in each box are shattered-- usable, but not ideal.  Maybe you'll have better luck.<br /><br />From my experience, I would guess that the lasagna and spaghetti would break more easily in transit than the shaped pastas (rotini, penne, and elbow).

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended
review/text: This great tasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

review/text: I have been a huge fan of Dreamfields since I tried them a couple of years ago; I had to do an online search for lasagne noodles as I could not find them in my local grocery store. The pasta does not taste like its low-carb; it cooks up al dente every time, and the fact that I can heat healthy, with low carbs with a low glycemic index, is a godsend.  For anyone who is like me, a pasta and bread lover (but not so much of a sweets lover) who struggles with eating right and losing weight, any of the Dreamfields pasta products should be tried.  I swear by them, and can't believe that they aren't more popular.

review/summary: Best Dolce Gusto Flavor
review/text: I have tried all of the "special" Dolce Gusto drinks since getting my machine.  I am not a fan of plain coffee, but drinks like the Mocha, Latte Macchiato were all good.  However, with each of them I was still not happy with the flavor I got.  They all seemed to me missing something (like the mocha in the Mocha drink)<br /><br />Not any more!  This Caramel Latte Macchiato is AMAZING.  It is way better than anything I have had from this machine or any coffee house in my life.  The smell while using the milk cup is great.  The caramel flavoring is in the milk and it smells so good.  I wish they would make a candle or something out of that smell.<br /><br />As for the drink itself, it is very, very good.  I like to stir mine to mix the flavors but you can enjoy it either way.  Just like the normal Latte Macchiato, this one gives you the same look when using a clear glass.  It is very smooth as well with no bad after taste.<br /><br />My only issue (which is with the whole Dolce Gusto machine in general) is the price!  For the roughly 8oz you get with this drink, you are paying around $1.00.  I could go to starbucks and get a much larger cup of a caramel latte for around the same price I would pay if I had to use 3 sets of cups.  The whole point of buying the machine was to save money, but that is just not happening.  It also doesn't help that Amazon does not have this on the monthly reorder service to save a few dollars, but hopefully that will be coming soon.  The price alone is what makes this amazing drink get a four stars from me.

review/text: I tried this new Caramel Latte Macchiato for the first time today and WOW! The Vanilla Latte has been my favorite of the Dolce Gusto coffees since I bought my Piccolo, but this Caramel Latte is tied with the Vanilla now. It smells so good brewing - sort of like the best caramel apples at the state fair combined with a hint of pecan pie baking. Inhaling it made me think of the first fall frosts. The taste is smooth and silky and there is no doubt this is a caramel flavored coffee - the Vanilla is a hint of flavor and this one is not shy or subtle in the least. I normally add a teaspoon of sugar to the other flavors, but this one is sweet enough on it's own to not need any additional sugar. Make sa very nice after dinner coffee or late afternoon soda replacement.

review/text: The caramel flavor on this caramel latte macchiato is rich and flavorful. The milk froths up well is very foamy. I only wish the capsules would make 8 ounces instead of 7. If you press the button for more it waters down the flavor, so I would rather use more capsules instead. I have to say I like the caramel latte macchiato, mocha and iced coffee flavors the best. Also, I wish nestle would have more uniform prices as the price varies depending upon which flavor you select. In spite of all of this, I would still recommend the nescafe dolce guto capsules and machine!

review/text: Since I bought my Dolce Gusto machine I have tried 9 different varieties of capsules, and the caramel latte is the one I buy over and over.  It smells intoxicating when you brew it and has a delicious caramel flavor, and I'm convinced there is a speck of cinnamon in it as well. It is not overly sweet, so I add sweetener. I have also been known to ramp up the flavor with Coffee Mate caramel or even vanilla or hazelnut. This coffee plays well with other flavors! I really wish they would introduce a bigger variety of capsules, but until that happens, caramel latte will be my favorite.

review/text: Another great coffee available for the Nescafe Dolce Gusto machine by Krups. I'm thrilled new flavors are being added. The coffee is similar to Dolce Gusto cafe grande intenso and the milk pod is sweetened and flavored with a rich caramel flavor so I still get a pretty good cup of coffee even using twice the water.<br /><br />I wish Nestle would sell the milk pods separately from the coffee so there would be 16 servings per box rather than just 8. There are 8 pods of coffee and 8 pods of milk per box which makes the flavored coffees twice the price of the ones without milk, which can get pretty expensive for a coffee lover as myself. Therefore I shall reverve this for the ocassional treat and continue using grande intenso as my main beverage.

review/summary: Heavy on the nutmeg.
review/text: I've used several brands of Garam Masala in my Chicken Tikka Masala recipe, and this one is by far the heaviest on nutmeg.  If you're a fan of nutmeg, that's fine, but it does leave a slight aftertaste and it doesn't appeal to me quite as much as others.<br /><br />The smell of the spice mix is nice (again, heavy on nutmeg scent), and the consistency is good. There were no lumps and it did seem fresh enough.  Overall, I'd buy it again if I still can't find the stuff I used to buy near my home.

review/summary: Test a small amount first...
review/text: I just finished making a huge batch of buttercream frosting using my typical recipe, I tasted the untinted version and was satisfied.  Unfortunately for me I did not do a small test amount before applying this Christmas Red to the entire batch - it has completely spoilt the frosting, leaving it with a harsh, very unpleasant after taste.  I have purchased cakes from Costco in the past and have learned to avoid anything that has red frosting as I get the exact same taste.  I also did not find this to be anywhere close to a Christmas red, perhaps I did not use enough, but given the resulting taste having only achieved a pinkish red, I can only imagine what a horrible tasting mess you would be left with if you tried to achieve a real red - my frosting ended up being inedible!

review/summary: Not a substitute for Norfolk Lavender's Lily of the Valley
review/text: I was looking for a substitute for the Lily of the Valley products that I had always loved from Norfolk Lavender, since they appear no longer to be producing that scent. On the recommendation of someone reviewing the Caswell-Massey version, I bought a tin of the talc. This stuff doesn't smell at all like the Lily of the Valley that I know and love. It smells more like Easter Lilies or hyacinths. It is blatant and heady, unlike the Norfolk Lavender version, which was light and lovely. When I use up this tin, I will look elsewhere. I certainly won't buy this again, as it comes close to being the heady kind of perfume that gives me headaches. As talc, it is fine, but the scent is not what I wanted in the least.

review/summary: Cake never arrived..
review/text: Photo of the cake looks good and I was happy I can send a choco cake to someone really far away from me.<br /><br />I called store to make sure they can deliver item on time (about a week). I kept on checking the delivery tracking because I was concerned it might not arrive on time. It did not arrive on time. In fact it didnt arrive at all. Very very disappointed. I ended up sending a gift card.

review/summary: Cheapest goldfish.
review/text: The best value in cost per ounce for Goldfish on Amazon. As a college student I go through about two of these boxes a month -- and at this price, my wallet isn't complaining. I managed to order two for $13 shipped. My only complaint is that the price fluctuates day to day, so just be wary of the cost.

review/summary: Goldfish - A Classic Snack
review/text: Goldfish snacks seem to have been around forever. Unless you are trying to avoid gluten, this is a good snack choice for that occasional urge to munch. Kids like the cute fish shape while adults might like the small size that's perfect snacking while doing something else at the same time, like reading or TV viewing.<br /><br />Goldfish are all natural with zero trans fat and no artificial preservatives. The foil lined bag keeps the Gold fish fresh as long as one remembers to refold the bag and hold the fold with a secure clip. A serving of 55 crackers is only 140 calories.<br /><br />The crackers have a mild, subdued taste which is actually a good thing - it's good for children and may help older snackers from over doing it.<br /><br />To me these whole grain fish taste and look like the regular Goldfish; the first ingredient of these though (after Smiles) is whole grain wheat flour. I like the taste of these in tomato soup and the aesthetics of watching the little fish float on the surface. The fun factor of this snack is immeasurable.

review/summary: I love Fishes!
review/text: These were so much better than I expected!  Why I switched from regular to these, I still don't know, probably because I wanted to try something new.<br /><br />My unhealthy habit #25: snacking.  I've loved to snack on Gold Fish since I was a kid.<br /><br />These were scrumptious and a bit better for me nutritiously than the standard Gold Fish (not by much).  The price on these are pretty high (hence the 4 star) compared to the regular but I will probably buy these again because they are just that good; have a bit more crunch and substance.  I still love the Fishes!

review/summary: Family Favorite
review/text: My family loves gold fish, we eat them all of the time. Put them in soup, snack on them at lunch and late at night. I bought the whole grain version to have something a bit healthier... although they aren't healthy by any means! The box is a great size, it's a bit smaller then the ones you might see at a grocery store though so do not expect one of the humongous boxes but it is still a great size and lasted my family of 3 for about a month which is a lot more affordable than buying the smaller boxes every week!
