review/summary: Senna Leaf
review/text: I used a higher priced senna for several years and out of the need to economize I tried alvita. Works just as well and is not individually wrapped as the others are and for me it's just one less thing I have to do considering I fix this every evening for me and hubby... I have medical problems so anything that saves me extra step I'm happy for it...

review/summary: Nasty tea debris everywhere!
review/text: When I opened this alot of the tea sacks were broken and the tea emptied out and spilled everywhere. I steeped some inside my cup and noticed that all sorts of the tea leaves had come out (I even took a picture and posted it under customer pics) and when I sipped my drink, tea leave crumbs got inside my mouth! I havent noticed any effect from the tea though but I have only used it for a few days so maybe it takes awhile. However, if they'd be able to keep the sacks closed that would help alot!

review/summary: Sage Tea - helping with hot flashes
review/text: When I bought the first box I had a cup of tea every night and thought the hot flashes subsided a bit, so I bought another box.  The second box, not so much.  I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.  Sage tea has been recommended by many as a means of cutting down hot flashes, vs taking meds that can be linked to cancer.  Give it try, it might work for you.

I have purchased other teas of this brand.  I would recommend their teas.  I wasn't crazy about the taste of the red clover, but that is just my personal opinion.  It's a little bitter but bearable.  Add some sugar and you're good to go.

review/summary: Interesting taste
review/text: I read about the benefits of Pau D'Arco tea and decided to give it a try. It's hard to find this tea in the market. The Whole Foods near my house doesn't have it either.<br /><br />The taste of this herbal tea is interesting: it's got a hint of sweetness with a very slight medicinal bitterness. Feels quite dry and alkaline to me. Color is light brown. Not particularly delightful or tasty, neither does it have a strong, captivating aroma like the Japanese roasted green tea - it's just weird beyond description. Reminds me of dried summer leaves. Not unpleasant though; I am still glad that I tried it!

This tea has an interesting taste-not your typical tea but not bad. It tastes pretty good with a bit of honey added actually.

I'm in amazement at how much it helps!<br /><br />The taste isn't great, but I don't think it's as bad as some other reviews have said. If you're concerned about the taste, you can use some sage from your spice cabinet and make a cup. It tastes pretty much the same, but it didn't seem cost effective to use the sage you buy in the spice aisle.

review/summary: Yes it does have an odor that some will find disagreeable, but it works for me and I will continue to purchase it
review/text: I read some of the reviews on here and I almost didn't purchase.  But I reached a point where due to my erratic work schedule, trying to fit in my studying time and completing assignments, my sleep pattern was disrupted and it was affecting my mood and concentration.  So I bit the bullet and purchased this at a local B&M store.  When I got home after work, I boiled some water and opened the package.  I noticed that this tea was packaged in a plastic bag so I guess it did has a pungent smell.  I opened the plastic bag and took a big whiff.  I was kind of disappointed.  It doesn't smell as bad as some of the other reviewers made it out to me but then again my nose has been wonky for some time so it could be me.  Yes I will admit that it does has a funky odor but it is not that strong to me.  To me, smells like this health food store I used to frequent in the Hyde Park neighborhood.  Very musky but weirdly comforting.  I have tried it with peppermint, turmeric (for a different affliction) and I have tried it plain with stevia and it taste okay to me.  I wouldn't say I have an iron stomach because I can easily get sick if food is left out in the open not at the proper temperature.  For me, this product took about two days for it to kick in and I am now able to sleep for a full eight hours straight instead of sleeping in fits of four hours here, wake up for about two hours, sleep for three, wake up for a hour and sleep for another four hours.  For those with sensitive noses and sense of taste, you have been amply warned by other reviewers.  For others, I say give it a shot or at least pair it with some other teas to dilute the taste a bit.  For example, mints like peppermint or spearmint will help.  Some folks will use lavender to mask the smell.

review/text: I was planning a menu for a book club party for The Forgotten Garden when I came across a character in the book that put cream on their jam-laden scone.  This was new to me.  I did research and found they were talking about clotted cream.  There are many imitation recipes for this, but I was curious how an authentic clotted cream would taste.  Wow!  This was amazing.  I made cream scones and topped them with the clotted cream and strawberry jam.  I will be sure this clotted cream is in my refrigerator every time I make scones...I cannot imagine there is anything better.

review/text: My first time trying clotted cream I didn't know what to think to be honest. The first thing I thought was BUTTER! It is every much just like a regular butter product we would get here in the US. After trying it a few more times I remember noticing that this really isn't just butter. This had a bit more flavor and depth to it. I like clotted cream on muffins, toats, or a scone which makes the perfect match. The flavor of clotted cream I thought had a slight "toasty" or nutty flavor that really stands out for me now.

It was separated in the bottle when I received it, as the weather is warm, but a little shaking and refrigeration combined it, and it is tasty.  I'd never had this before, but had often thought about it.  It tastes like thick, high fat content butter; how could you go wrong?  It does make me wonder though what the heart disease rate is in England.  Delivery was quick as promised, and they sent one jar until the other jars were available, which was thoughtful.

review/text: I was expecting a milkier, richer taste but this tastes just like plain whipped butter or even just plain butter, but less salty. When the bottle arrived, the cream contents looked strange because the cream had a marbling color of neon yellow and white; not a uniform white, milk color shown in the picture advertised.  The cream settled to the bottom of the jar and also looked lumpy. I might have received a bad jar, or the contents might have chemically altered due to heat in transit, I don't know, but the cream was not at all what I expected.  It did not taste like the clotted cream I ate when I was in England and did not have a smooth texture.

review/summary: best straight out of the box on arrival....
review/text: The description states that this tastes like a cross between ice cream+butter and I'd have to *mostly* agree, but this is a silkier, creamier taste experience all its own. When straight out of the refrigerator it does have a texture reported in other reviews sort of like very dense whipped butter. When I had this at a cafe in England it was served a little softer, just like how the sealed jar arrives (unrefrigerated) which is how I use it. Ooohhhh, does it make a croissant, scone, or waffle into an event to be remembered!<br /><br />I'd say this is fairly true to taste of what I was served in England and for me that's close enough. I've tried making my own once and unless you (a); own a cow for the VERY best cream, (b); are willing to waste a lot of cream to get the curds to form, and (c); have oodles of time on your hands to tweak and get the desired result, it's just not very cost/time/taste effective to make from scratch.<br /><br />Sometimes, depending on the vendor, I can get the overall cost down by ordering three jars and the one ship charge stays the same.

review/text: I fell in love with clotted cream after a trip to england. I was excited to see that it was sold here, but disappointed at the quality. The texture wasn't the same and the taste was just off. I made some in the oven with a mixture of raw goat milk and cow cream that was much closer to the original English product. When I want clotted cream again, I'll bite the bullet and invest the 12 hours into making my own. This is better than nothing, but not by much. When you brag to people how great clotted cream is and then offer them this, it's understandable when they don't jump for joy.

review/summary: YOU HAVE TO ADD POWDERED SUGAR
review/text: I have purchased this before and it tastes nothing like the stuff you get in tea rooms in the US (and even some in the UK). That's because many people will add powdered sugar and even heavy whipping cream to this, whip it all together and then spread it on scones with jam. There is a Victorian restaurant & tea room near me that serves the BEST clotted cream and I know for certain (from an employee mentioning it) that they start with this jarred stuff but they add powdered sugar and cream -- and maybe something else -- to get the airy, sweet stuff they serve with scones. I'm still trying to get them to part with the recipe. Anyway -- that's probably why many people were disappointed with the texture or felt it lacked the flavor they found in restaurant clotted cream or Devonshire cream.

The Tiger Spice is a great blend of Black Tea, Cinnamon, Ginger, herbs, and more. I was not a big tea drinker (until now) but this is a very smooth and light Chai. All you do is add water and it comes out creamy and perfect (some people add milk but this Chai mix already has a creamer in it). This is my new healthy breakfast wake me up. It is great. I have many Indian friends with whom I drink freshly made Chai with and this is as close as you can come with an instant blend. I highly recommend this.

review/summary: Best Tiger Chai I've found...
review/text: My husband and I frequent a local cafe where they make the most fabulous tasting Tiger Chai's.  However, they are incredibly tight lipped about their secret powder.  I've scoured the internet, purchased everything from Oregon Chai (liquid is decent, but the powder is better), Pacific Chai (better than Oregon), and the ultimate that blows away the competition, David Rio's Tiger Spice Chai.  It's what I consider to be just about as good as what the cafe serves - rich, frothy and not too sweet.  It's best mixed with milk or milk substitute instead of water.  David Rio's Elephant Vanilla Chai is also good for sweet tooths.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Best seved cold!!
review/text: A friend of mine got me hooked on Tiger Chai while visiting her this summer. I always ordered them "iced" which means that they pour it over ice and milk. It was SOOO good that way.  It has a ginger bread cookie kind of taste that I just got addicted to.

review/text: Back when I had my second job..many years ago..we served this chai.I got a taste for it YEARS later and was able to find it here on Amazon!I was thrilled and it tasted just as good as I remembered.I think it is perfectly spiced with the right amount of creamy sweetness.I don't like any of the other boxed liquid or other powdered chais out there.Most are too sweet or too much spice.I always go back to this one.

review/summary: Great Chai With One Flaw
review/text: I discovered Tiger Chai a few years back at a little cafe, and have been enamoured with it's flavour ever since.  It's a bit of a far cry from either homemade chai or the more common instant ones (Morning Glory or Oregon), but it's really quite addicting.  I have to be careful not to drink more than 2 or 3 cups once I get started!<br /><br />The only drawback with this powder is the inclusion of the nasty, super-processed instant creamer.  They don't put enough of it in the mix to really make the product creamy at all - you have to still mix it with whole milk to really make it into chai.  However, you can still taste the awful artificial stuff.  It would be so nice to get a version without the instant creamer - you could add some milk and this would qualify for being hands-down the best instant chai on the market.<br /><br />Mixed with milk, it's still very good, but I don't recommend using just hot water.

review/summary: Delicious mix!
review/text: I first experienced chai yrs ago in a mom-and-pop Near Eastern/Mediterranean restaurant, and I commented on how good it was.  The lady working at the time said "We're Pakistani, we know how to make it!"  Since moving from the area, I've been buying it from chain cafes and whatever powder or liquid concentrate was available at the store.  (I never did get the hang of brewing it from a bag.)  I was reasonably satisfied w/ the OLD General Foods (white can) recipe...didn't taste like the authentic stuff, but still good.<br /><br />I decided to look online after buying my last can (tan) of General Foods and having to dump it out.  It's the only kind my grocery has.  (I actually thought I'd used bad milk w/ the first cup...but it had the same bad flavor w/ fresh milk.  I figured they'd changed the recipe, which I'm certain of after reading Amazon reviews.)<br /><br />I ended up choosing a single can of David Rio Tiger Spice and one of Elephant Vanilla (which I haven't tried yet.)  WOW!!!  The Tiger Spice is by far the closest I've tasted to that first cup in the restaurant.  It's lightly sweet but not TOO sweet, and the spices are bold without having overpowering amounts of cardamom or cloves.<br /><br />I'm liking the ingredient list too (being aware that powdered creamer isn't perfect).  David Rio: cane sugar, creamer, honey granules, black tea powder, natural spice blend, natural flavors.  General Foods: sugar, nondairy creamer, maltodextrin, instant tea, &lt;2% of natural and artificial flavor, sodium citrate, modified cornstarch, silicon dioxide.

review/text: I was buying this chai from World Market, but they stopped selling it! I have tried so many other brands and varieties, and nothing comes close to this delicious mix. So, Here I am on Amazon buying it because this is the only place I can find it. I am getting the 4lb bag because it will not go to waste. All of my friends who have tried it love it. My coworkers who sit near me just smell the open canister and comment on how delicious it smells, so I have to buy some for them too so they don't drink all of my chai! If you are in doubt, buy this one, you will love it! If you don't love it, send it to me :-)

Exactly as it's always been, with that lovely texture, some oiliness, and amazing rich flavor. It's all I can do to refrain from eating an entire package in one sitting. *gasp*<br /><br />I won't hesitate at all to order another 6-pack...or, more likely, SEVERAL 6-packs. Yes, it's that good.

review/summary: Joyva Halvah 8-oz bars
review/text: I've been eating this delicacy since the early 60's - my father used to down a whole package an evening and my mother used to clean out the local Giant Food of its stock. In recent years it has become increasingly hard to find, particularly in this size (there is a small size more easily available). My former on-line source apparently went out of business and AMazon now seems to be the only on-line source. Halvah tends to come only in big brick sizes but Joyva always has had this more manageable size. And it is delicious - not too sweet, aand somewhat nutritious (sesame seeds).Product arrived quickly and in perfect conditon. Buy a box, put it in the freezer and take out a package at a time.

review/summary: They changed the recipe! No longer tasty
review/text: But it's just as well as they aren't good for you.<br />But I sure used to love them. They used to have a delicious taste and texture. They used to be really oily. When you bit them they had a unique crystally magic crunch texture. When you bit it it came apart in flaky layers.<br /><br />Today when I bought one I was worried as the package was different. Also on the inside I knew it was different because the old bars used to be surrounded by a wax cardboard liner on 3 sides, now the new one had it only on the bottom. I could see that the new bar did not have chocolate swirls even though it was marble. The old ones you could clearly see chocolate swirls.<br />The new one: first bite, dry, no velvet crystal crunch texture, no tearing off and leaving flaky layers extending. It was not oily. AND WORST OF ALL: IT HAD NO FLAVOR! AND EVEN WORSE: IT HAS A SOUR RANCID TASTE AND THERE IS NO DATE ON PAKCAGE. SHAME ON YOU JOYVA FOR CHANGING THE RECIPE. MORONS

review/text: My husband mentioned he wanted raspberry syrup and I couldn't find anything locally.  I found this on Amazon and thought I would give it a try.  Since I bought this, he has had a Hagen Das bar in a dish every night and put this raspberry syrup on it.  He says it tastes real good and I do believe him as I keep going to the grocery store buying ice cream.  Only drawback is these are large bottles and four of them will last quite awhile.  Hopefully with the warm weather coming up I can mix it in drinks to try otherwise four bottles will last me a few years.

review/summary: The Best Bacon - Ever!
review/text: This applewood smoked bacon is the best I have ever had, and I have tried a lot.  This is a thick, meaty bacon with an awesome smoked flavor.  At the same time, it is naturally low in sodium so you don't have that funny aftertaste in your mouth after eating the bacon.  It is truly the best bacon you will ever eat and is worth every penny.

review/summary: Nueske's thick sliced applewood bacon
review/text: OK.  I know if you are reading this you must be a bacon fan or know someone who is.  Bacon is an art form and it must be addressed as such.  No one bacon appeals to everyone in the same manner, but we can all agree that it is a great treat now and again.  Decided to try the above referenced meat from Nueske and despite the inherent high priced shipping charges due to it being a perishable product, it came fairly quickly and in excellent shape/and cold temperature.  Well, just tried some and I have to say if you like real applewood smoked taste in a true thick sliced bacon then here is your product.  Great flavor, texture and it cooks up to a perfect hue.  My kitchen is still intoxicating from the aroma.  Try it with my own 3 egg scramble for maximum effect:<br /><br />3 eggs, dash each salt and pepper, 2 shakes worcestershire, 3-4 drops tabasco, one to two TBSP each of half and half and a good quality salsa like Pace's, a shake or two of garlic powder, some bleu cheese crumbles to taste or whatever cheese might float your boat but don't overload it...its just there to add a hint of flavor and about 3 TBSP fresh cut up green chives all mixed up and scrambled in the bacon oil leftovers from doing your bacon:  Scramble and mix over medium low heat until done. Easy now, don't rush it and turn heat off once eggs have begun to stiffen up and let it coast til you are ready to serve.  Toss the freshly cooked bacon on top of it and cover until you are ready to dish it up.  This is a scrambled egg breakfast you will savor my friends!  Enjoy this quality bacon and save some for later too.

review/text: I discovered Nueske's while working in a restaurant. We used the bacon in a spinach salad, but this bacon is so good recipes should be invented around it.<br /><br />Just opening the cryopack causes the mouth to water. Perfectly salty, smoky and sweet and there is about 50% lean and both the fat and lean are beautiful.<br /><br />Be warned: after eating Nueske's bacon everything you will find at the grocery store will be a bland disappointment.

review/text: I have tried allot of bacon over the years and this is the best one I have found. Very heavy smoke, but does not taste bitter or acrid. Smells smokier than it tastes, it will perfume your kitchen. This is also very lean bacon so don't worry that you are paying for some very expensive fat. Still, it's not cheap and you have to be a hard core bacon lover to pay that much, especially if you have to pay shipping on top of it. Would be a great gift though.

review/text: Until recently, Nueske's was my favorite bacon. The perfectly sliced lean strips with their heavenly taste and aroma was always a winner on the breakfast table or as an ingredient in my other dishes. The last two orders I placed with Nueske's have been a huge dissapointment. Much of the smokey flavor was missing and the amount grease left over after frying was astounding; leaving me with hardly any meat. The company is now obviously purchasing inferior pork bellies and rushing the processing time. There are many other premium bacons on the market that are worth a premium price. I would suggest to my fellow bacon connaisseurs out there that you give one of these other companies a try and forget about Greaseke's

review/summary: Deliciously different little wafer cookies
review/text: I'm a recent convert to Bahlsen cookies, and these little wafers are a standout among a product line that's hard not to love.  The crisp. toasty, slightly nuttly wafers surround a very light, not-too-sweet creme layer; the combination is an incredible, multi-dimensional treat that would pair nicely with coffee or milk.  The only thing I would think that would make this product better is a resealable package, but the wafers aren't going to last long once opened anyway.  The package size is good in the sense that it's enough to share with one or two other people, but if you eat the whole thing yourself it's not an utter disaster ;)

This cookie is amazingly delicious.  I like sweets that aren't too sweet, with just the right hint of sugar.  These are cookies just like that.  Like Creme Brulee -- barely sweetened, but if it is done right, the sweetness makes it the best food in the world.  I'm not saying these cookies are Creme Brulee, but maybe they approach the creme brulee of cookies.

review/text: The Bahlsen Delobas are my favorite so far. Call them biscuits or call them cookies they are just plain good. Light and pastry like with a nice burst of sweetness from the red current jam. Try Them!

review/text: I had these cookies in Germany, but I had a hard time finding them in the US.  I was amused to discover I could order them from Amazon.  They seem to be most closely related to pecan sandies, but they're a little richer and a little moister.  I wish it were possible to order a single box instead of 12, but I already knew I liked them, so ordering 12 wasn't really a problem.  A bigger problem is trying not to eat them all immediately.
