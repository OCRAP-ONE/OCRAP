review/summary: Nice Accent
review/text: I took a while to review this product because frankly, at first, I didn't like it. I tasted it alone and thought there was no way it could work with anything. So I put it in the refrigerator and forgot about it.<br /><br />Then one day I decided to actually try it on something. First attempt: Turkey burgers. Result: Deliciousness. I could not believe how much better the burger tasted than normal, nor could I believe how much better the sauce tasted than when I tried it alone. I suppose it is like wine paired with food, or perhaps more accurately, any ingredient that tastes better when paired with something else.<br /><br />Since that time I have tried it on numerous other foods. Same result ... it very much complements the flavor of foods, especially meats.<br /><br />It's not just for tacos!

review/summary: Really Bold Flavor
review/text: This is the third Taco Bell sauce I've tried and I'm not disappointed in its claim of boldness.  I think the dominant spice is cumin so it packs quite a wallop. But it's not spicy to a point that it's hard to eat.  I ate it with some fried chicken and fresh carrots and it made the meal more interesting.  Then I thought I'd mix some honey in and it tasted quite amazing.  I am definitely a fan of this sauce and other than using it on its own, I think I can mix it with mayo and have a Mexican flavored salad dressing.  Or stir it in a bowl of chili.  Or give soup a little kick.  It probably will taste good brushed on grilled meat as well.  Very versatile flavor.  I wish Taco Bell had these sauces available at their restaurants.

review/summary: Okay, but Not the Greatest
review/text: 2.75 stars<br /><br />This dressing/sauce is pretty good. The ranch flavor isn't very pronounced, but it has a slightly spicy kick to it. I don't think I would use it regularly because it had an artificial taste. However, it's not horrible and I could see those who are tired of the same old ranch dressing giving this a try.

review/summary: Tastes exactly like Taco Bell
review/text: While it's been ages since I've eaten Taco Bell, it did at one point form a substantial portion of my diet. Those days are over, but when ths sauce was offered in the Vine program,I decided to give it a whirl for old time's sake.<br /><br />It tastes exactly like Taco Bell, which is to say: gross if you're not a Taco Bell fan, but I suspect familiar and tasty if you are.<br /><br />Personally, I was a little horrified to find my home-cooked tacos tasting like Taco Bell.<br /><br />So while I'd never buy or eat this myself, I'm also unlikely to deliberately eat Taco Bell, while anyone buying a Taco Bell condiment clearly favors Taco Bell flavors. So I'm giving it 3 stars. While I personally find it yucky and synthetic-tasting, it really truly tastes exactly like what you think when you think Taco Bell. Based on that, it lives up to expectations and would probably rate 5 stars if all food was graded only on the merits of its Taco Bellness. But we live in a world with other condiments, and this is pretty terrible by objective standards--something of an unholy union between that awful Taco Bell mild sauce and cheap bottled Ranch Dressing.<br /><br />However, given that only a numbskull would expect bright gourmet flavors from Taco Bell brand, it deserves 3 stars. If Taco Bell is what you seek, you'll find it here.

review/text: This is a decent sauce but it isn't spicy or bold enough for me. It is fine as a veggie dip, can be used with quesadillas, and even as a salad dressing, but if you love really spicy sauces, this may have you reaching for hot pepper sauce to kick it up a notch.  My kids, however, think it is plenty spicy.

review/summary: Yuck
review/text: First, I'm not a fan of Taco Bell food. It's relatively cheap, it's relatively bland, and it bears only passing resemblance to actual Mexican food. I eat it, but it's the McDonald's of Mexican food. I love spicy sauces, though, so I thought I'd give this "Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero" a try.<br /><br />The description makes this sound exciting and interesting. When I unscrewed the cap, the sauce smelled tempting. Then I paired it with food, and it just went downhill.<br /><br />Meats? Nope, too conflicting. Vegetables? Nope, too overwhelming. Fruit? (Didn't go there.) Chips? Yeah, that was okay, but nothing that made me want to do it again. Out of a desire to use up the bottle, I threw some on a hot dog wrapped in a flour tortilla - and it tasted so bad that I had to throw it out.<br /><br />I give this two stars because I used the sauce with some chicken breasts and melted shredded cheddar cheese, and that was actually pretty good. However, I can't wholeheartedly recommend a sauce that tastes "pretty good" on only one kind of food. If you like the Taco Bell brand (which is actually misleading, because I don't think I've ever tasted this exact flavor on anything I've eaten at Taco Bell), and you enjoy specialty sauces with your chips, this might be for you. If you're looking for a versatile sauce that will add a fun zing to your cooking, however, steer clear of this. It doesn't play well with most foods.

review/summary: Good - not very "spicy" ...
review/text: I liked this just fine.  The name is a little misleading:  It's really not very spicy at all.  It does have a lot of flavor, however.  I've tried it on sandwiches (very good), and on tacos of various types.  I liked it best on fish tacos, with shredded lettuce and chopped tomato.  It also works well on chicken tacos and burritos.  I also liked it as a salad dressing for a "southwestern" salad (romaine, corn/black bean salsa, chopped tomato, a few ounces of chopped cooked chicken, mixed colby/jack cheese (or pepper jack), a few sliced black olives, and a couple of tablespoons of this sauce.  Amazon's price is quite good compared to my local grocery stores.

review/summary: Best of the Taco Bell sauces
review/text: This is by far the very best tasting of all of the Tack Bell Sauces. While it doesn't really give you that from a Tack Bell stand taste, it has a very smooth and balanced flavor that enhances rather than overpowers what you put it on. I particularly like it on scrambled eggs, soy cheese, green onions & lettuce, wrapped in a whole wheat flour tortilla. While I haven't been a fan of the other Taco Bell sauces, they hit a home run with this one. I'm now a loyal fan of the Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce. ENJOY!

review/summary: Spice up plain dishes!
review/text: I use spicy ranch in several of my favorite recipe's so I was excited to see this product available.  The problem was taste, it just didn't do it for me.  I like a chile-spice pop to go with the ranch dressing taste and what I got was an overwhelming flavor of too many spices.  I'll grant that I am not a Taco Bell aficionado, so my taste buds may be a little underdeveloped here...but if your food has plenty of flavor this dressing may be too much.<br /><br />On a plain beef taco with cheese, the kids gave it a thumbs up, so it will get used.<br /><br />Bottom line, use it on plain dishes and you will get something more.  Use it on complex dishes and it will be too much.

review/summary: Small bottle, flavor less bold than advertised
review/text: I tried this sauce with some friends of mine when we got together and made burritos. We all seemed to agree that the sauce tastes fine, but it's probably not worth buying. For a "bold and creamy spicy ranchero sauce," I was expecting something a bit bolder and spicier. It was definitely creamy, but the flavor wasn't very memorable. The spice level was comparable to medium salsa, maybe even a bit milder than that. One friend summed it up pretty nicely by saying it didn't taste very "ranchero-y" to her.<br /><br />In addition to the rather underwhelming flavor, this sauce comes in an extremely small bottle. It's shaped in a somewhat deceptive manner that maximizes its surface area, but the reality is that the sauce inside will fill a soda can two-thirds of the way to the top. This stuff tastes fine, but there have to be better-tasting sauces out there that are cheaper besides.

review/text: My family likes Taco Bell and we like this Spicy Ranchero Sauce okay. We eat Mexican-ish style dishes quite a bit at home, so it's nice to have a bottled sauce for a little extra kick. My daughter especially liked the flavor in this particular sauce, but of course, not everyone has the same tastes. I also liked that it comes in a squeeze bottle with a flip lid with a small hole, rather than having to try to pour it out of the larger opening. That makes it convenient for adding just the amount you want. It can be used as a salad dressing, if you like thick dressings... or as a dipping sauce for tortilla chips, or on tacos, burritos, what-have-you.

review/text: My 14-year-old takes after his father and loves anything spicy. He'd already tried the other two flavors, Chipotle and Jalapeno, so of course we had to get the Spicy Ranchero too. My son says it's spicier than the other two but still not as spicy as other sauces he uses. But he loves all three and dips a wide variety of foods in them....and then licks the plate! These seem nearly impossible to find locally, so I am thrilled we can get them here! You might be disappointed if you want really spicy, but overall the flavors are apparently really good (I am allergic to pepper but I trust my 14-year-old's palate!), so give them a try.

review/summary: Almost Bold Enough
review/text: This is a great Taco Bell sauce for sandwiches, tacos, gorditos, chalupas, and even burritos. While the manufacturer likens it to a ranch dressing, it is not a great dressing for your standard salad -- unless it's a taco salad. In my opinion, the ranch flavor is a bit mild and the spices could use a little more of a kick. I still like it though, and I think adding it to the aforementioned foods gives them that little bit extra. I put some on a meatloaf sandwich I made today, and the flavor reminded me of eating a taco. I wish it didn't have so many additives and unnecessary ingredients though.<br /><br />Bold & Creamy is a fun addition to condiments for a Mexican themed meal. It has a creamy Taco Bell flavor reminiscent of their fast food that you either like or don't. How it works with other culinary styles will depend on the dish you are making, though I found it to play nice with chicken dishes. The bottom line though is that you can make a much healthier and fresher tasting version of your own, given a little extra time and the right ingredients. For a quick fix though, Bold & Creamy isn't bad.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: Can You Take the Heat?
review/text: When I closed my review about the Bold & Creamy Jalapeno Sauce from Taco Bell, I said that I thought they could really kick it up a notch. I didn't know about Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero. The heat lingers just a  bit longer in the mouth than the Jalapeno and Chipotle sauces. It never becomes too intense or makes you regret putting a little extra on your tacos, or wraps. Rest assured, that if you run out they will just make more. So go ahead, be bold, put on a little extra. Your taste buds with thank you and your stomach won't regret it.<br />This pale orange sauce is about the color of good Thousand Island Dressing. But trust me when I tell you, if you put this on someone's salad by mistake, they are going to sit up and take notice. It's the right combination of spicy and creamy and a bottle of this stuff doesn't last long at my house. It goes on our breakfast wraps in the morning and I am always dreaming up new ways to use it. If you like spicy you definitely want to give this one a try.

review/summary: What are the ingredients in Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce?
review/text: Ranchero sauce is traditionally tomato-based, similar to the salsa brought to the table with tortilla chips in "Mexican" restaurants.<br /><br />I compared the ingredients of this sauce to a jar of commercial mayonnaise.  The primary difference is the substitution of whey for some of the egg plus the addition of flavorings, colorings, preservatives, and chemicals to adjust the texture and thickness.<br /><br />The resulting mildly spicy sauce has the appearance and consistency of Thousand Island dressing with tiny specks in it but with a very unpleasant chemical smell and taste.<br /><br />You can easily make a much better-tasting and less expensive substitute for this sauce by adding  a tablespoon of salsa or ketchup, a teaspoon of chili powder, and a half-teaspoon each of garlic powder and sugar to a cup of mayonnaise, with vinegar-based hot sauce to taste.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Soybean Oil, Water, Whey (from Milk), Vinegar, Buttermilk*, Salt, Egg Yolks, Sugar.<br /><br />Contains less than 2% of Spice, Tomato*, Modified Food Starch, Garlic*, Garlic Juice, Onions*, Xanthan Gum, Citric Acid, Yeast Extract, Phosphoric Acid, Gum Arabic, Corn Syrup, Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate, Natural Flavor, Artificial Color, with Sorbic Acid and Calcium Disodium EDTA as preservatives.<br /><br />*Dried. Contains: Milk, Egg.<br /><br />Nutrition:<br /><br />Serving size: 2 Tablespoons 29g<br />Servings - 8<br /><br />Amount per serving:<br />Calories - 110<br />Total fat - 11g<br />Saturated fat - 1.5g<br />Trans fat - 0g<br />Cholesterol - 10mg<br />Sodium - 310mg<br />Total Carbohydrates - 3g<br />Fiber - 0g<br />Sugars - 1g<br />Protein - &lt;1g<br />Vitamin A - 2% DV<br />Vitamin C - 0% DV<br />Calcium - 0% DV<br />Iron 0% - DV<br /><br />*** Note that although the bottle looks exactly like a regular Kraft salad dressing bottle, it is only 8 ounces instead of the usual 16 ounces.

review/text: This is probably the best of the available Taco Bell Sauces, but that's not really saying much. I doubt I'd use ANY of them again, but if I absolutely HAD to, it'd probably be this one. The taste is a weird cross between Ranch and a Mayo-diluted jar of Taco Bell's Fire Sauce. The spice totally overwhelms the Ranch, and while I'm generally in favor of extra spice, the flavors just do not mix well. I'll stick with the little packets of Fire Sauce that you get in the restaurant, thanks.

review/text: While I enjoyed the chipotle flavored sauce that is offered by the Taco bell brand, I didn't have the same level of excitement for the Ranchero flavor. To me, it just seemed somewhat bland, with no real zeal or kick to it. Personally, I like my Mexican food or even Tex-Mex dishes to have some spice to it, and this sauce just seems to temper it. Again, I loved the chipotle flavored Taco Bell sauce, as it has now replaced sour cream as my usually topping for nachos; however, I can't muster up the same level of excitement for the ranchero flavor.

review/summary: Yuck and expired... Part Deux
review/text: I reviewed another flavor (jalapeno) and once again I cannot possibly give this product higher than a one star because I truly HATE it.  As the other bottle had arrived well past it's :best if used by date:, so did this bottle.  I still gave it a shot because it didn't necessarily scream EXPIRES BY.  The Spicy Ranchero was once again not spicy but more ranchy with a very weird sweet tang.  This could have possibly been because it was past it's prime.  I hope that others' experience was more enjoyable because my husband and myself just couldn't get past the first taste.  He doesn't like spicy anything while I will pour tabasco sauce on certain things.  There isn't a happier medium to have tried out this product; we both hated it!  I can't put my taste bud on it but this isn't something that I would ever like.<br /><br />Do not recommend and thoroughly disappointed in Amazon's decision to ship out any product past their shelf life.  Hopefully that hasn't dinged this new line of sauces from Taco Bell.  I do know that I will not be purchasing.  As my previous review stated, I love Taco Bells' sauce packets and was hoping that these sauces were along the same flavor profile.  Color me disappointed...

review/summary: Tastes good, can use in a variety of recipes even on your sandwich (if you like spicy food)
review/text: This 'Bold & Creamy' ranchero sauce is fairly spicy. It tastes good (creamy and spicy) in salads, as sandwich spread (very moderate amounts) as well as in some cooked foods (see below). If you cannot stand too much spice, use in moderation. Here is what I tried.<br /><br />1. Made a simple salad with chopped spinach, tomatoes, black beans and potatoes. Adding a little bit of the sauce made it very tasty<br />2. Used as a spread in a mesquite turkey deli sandwich.<br />3. Made a potato/taco filling: stir fry one chopped onion, mix in some black beans and corn (half can ea), add the sauce (~2-3tbsp) and stir - finally add chopped tomatoes and mix well. set aside. Use this filling either in taco shells or as topping on potato slices - cut potato in to 1/4inch thick slices. coat with a mixture of olive oil, paprika and little bit of salt. Place slices on a cookie sheet and bake for 15' @ 350 deg. Remove from oven, place ~2tbsp topping mix on top of each potato slice, add some grated cheddar cheese and bake for another 5' until the cheese melts.<br /><br />All of these tasted very good and I liked the added spicy taste.

review/summary: Not Too Bold, Not Too Spicy
review/text: The bottle may make you think this is a salad dressing. It's not. It's a smooth, medium consistency, tangy sauce. It is a little spicy, but not overly so. I haven't tasted anything similar to it at a Taco Bell fast food restaurant. I first tried it on chicken tacos and it was pretty good. Where it really shined, though, was as part of a dip. I added a bit of sour cream, cilantro and finely chopped tomatoes. It was quite good. I would definitely serve it to guests.

review/summary: Spicy but lacks a good flavor
review/text: I was very interested in trying this since about once a week I made hard tacos, soft tacos, or a taco salad.<br /><br />As another reviewer stated I received my bottle in October and the bottle stated "Best if used by 30SEP2011".  I would be nervous to buy the product fearing they might be expired. I went ahead and used it and I cannot put my finger on the flavor other than I did not like it. I am not one that likes really spicy sauces. I usually buy mild or medium taco sauce. I used the bold and creamy on a chicken taco wraps and the taste was overpowering, not in a good way. It has a heavy and spicy taste to it that just is not pleasant. I even tried to use it as a dip but still did not like it.<br /><br />It seems reviewers either love it or dislike it, I think you would have to put me in the dislike group. I had high hopes this would compliment the food I make at home but so far it seems to almost ruin the food you use it on. I will say it was spicier than I thought it would be. Again, I do not eat really spicy food but it had a kick to it but not a good flavor. I think there is a lot of room for improvement and what seemed like a good idea Taco Bell seemed to mess up. I would not buy this nor suggest it. I had a friend try it on one of my wraps and he disliked it and he loves spicy foods. He said it was heavy tasting and nasty. I would have to agree.

It really didn't add much to the flavor of my taco, it more distracted from the real taco flavors. I didn't care for it but my kids did put it on their tacos and not complain, hence the 3 stars. For me it was just extra calories as it did absolutely nothing for my taco, except make it more creamy.

review/text: I ordered this thru the Vine program because I recently tried another Taco Bell dressing and was pleasantly surprised. I never buy Taco Bell products, and I didn't realize that the dip I was eating was Taco Bell Jalapeno flavor when I tried it at a friend's house. I was excited to see this available on vine, but unfortunately, I found this to taste fake, processed, and not very spicy. I thought my kids may like it with tacos as it wasn't very spicy but they didn't think it tasted good, either.

review/summary: Fatty and Flavorless
review/text: I thought that Taco Bell Bold and Creamy Spicy Ranchero Sauce had a lot of potential. After all, a number of Taco Bell restaurant menu offerings are quite good, even if not necessarily exceptional.<br /><br />Alas, I was disappointed; sorely disappointed, in fact. Let's start with nutritional information. A two tablespoon serving--- a fairly large serving, actually--- is 110 calories. That's quite a bit, but a smaller serving could control this. The issue is that of these 110 calories, a whopping 100 of them are from fat. That's hardly a healthy makeup.<br /><br />What about flavor? The sauce was creamy in consistency, but it was not creamy in taste; for that matter, neither was it bold or spicy. Our daughter described it as "taco seasoning mixed with lard." That is perhaps a bit harsh as there is no lard in the product, but nevertheless the sauce does have a fatty mouth feel and very little flavor. We tried it on a mixed salad (with onions, etc., to ensure that it would not be over-powered); we also tried it on tortilla chips and cooked ground beef. The results were all the same. There was little flavor and the sauce made the food taste and feel fatty.<br /><br />Though I wanted to like the sauce, I have to say that based on our experience with it, I definitely can't recommend it. It is unhealthy and lacking in flavor, and generally detracts from the food it was intended to enhance.<br /><br />Full disclosure: I really have to point out that the review sample I received was a few days beyond the "best used by" date. Although this wasn't exactly clever marketing to send your expired stock to your reviewers, I doubt if the product had deteriorated much if at all. Still, I mention this because it could have conceivably had an effect, and if you choose to buy the product, by all means be sure you have fresh stock.

review/summary: Long lasting, and safer in my experience.
review/text: My dogs, and many of my client's dogs, inhale regular rawhides.  I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

review/summary: Better than the movies themselves!
review/text: For around thirty bucks I was greeted at the door with a box so full of popcorn kernels, butter salt, and coconut oil that I could barely lift it. The delivery guy sure was confused when I told him "just popcorn stuff" was inside it. Needless to say, the bang-for-buck value of this purchase is not in doubt.<br /><br />Opening it, I was happy to find literally dozens of individual plastic packets of the kernels, oil, and salt, each packet of which containing one serving of each item. The instructions may tell you do dump one entire full packet into your popcorn popper, but that's only if you have HUGE industrial strength machine. I cut servings into thirds.<br /><br />While I'm overjoyed at how much pure product you get, the packets themselves are a bit of a hassle. All the butter salt is stored together within the kernel section of the packet, and it's all mashed at the bottom, almost impossible to get out-- though it's absolutely delicious if you finally manage to. The coconut oil is stored on the other side of the packet, and it pours out easily and conveniently, though I wish it had a seal for easy (and less messy!) storage. Regardless, coconut oil (and this one in particular) absolutely MAKE your popcorn "movie theater grade" popcorn. It's an exact duplicate. The smell alone will transport your senses to your local cineplex.<br /><br />All in all, a very worthy purchase for popcorn fans, movie buffs, and salty treat enthusiasts of all ages, the world over. Quite recommended.

It didn't pop evenly, leaving a good amount of unpoped kernals as it started to burn the others.  The poped corn dosen't have a great flavor.  We could have saved a lot by simply buying store brand popcorn.  We will not buy this again.

review/summary: Simply Great
review/text: If you want popcorn that is just like the theater and don't want to fool around with measuring cups and oil, then this is the product for you.  Absolutely love the flavor and ease of use.  Was a little concerned about the appearance of the oil (was solidified), but works great.  With my larger 16oz popper, I can feed the entire crowd at one time.  And....you can't beat the price through Amazon.....

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: Very tasty popcorn and very simple. Just cut open, dump in a pot and shake and wait. But I will warn you, this much popcorn is hard to get completely popped on the stove-top. I have lots of unpopped kernels every time. I would suggest you buy the smaller bags for stove-top popping. If you have a larger theater-style kettle popper, this is perfect.

review/summary: Cream of wheat dumpling soup or Knedle soup
review/text: Excellent European taste Dumpling soup for last minute fix up. It takes only ten minutes of boiling time. It's enough for 2 people or as appetizer for 4 people. I usually add my own fresh made dumplings to the soup (mix cream of wheat with egg and some minced parsley and add teaspoonfuls to boiling water); that makes for richer soup.

review/summary: Best GF Pasta
review/text: We've tried so many GF pastas, including making our own. Riso Bello has been the best thus far. Yes, it is a little bit expensive. But, the texture is right, and it holds up as leftovers. One other popular brand I tried had a similar texture, and held sauce well, but no one ever finished an entire bowl - because it had zero taste. Riso Bello has no weird after taste, and while it isn't perfect, it is very good. In fact, I used it to make homemade macaroni and cheese and it was heavenly!

review/text: The product was cloudy and pale, not dark and clear like true sorghum syrup. The taste and mouthfeel was more reminiscent of gum acacia or gelatin. I was very dissapointed and discarded the material as unappetizing at best. I found another supplier who is a member of the sorghum syrup producers association and displays their logo.

review/text: I am disappointed with the sorgham from Barry Farms! It has very little sorgham flavor to it. In fact, my daughter said that it tastes more like syrup that you would buy at the grocery store and I tend to agree. Sorgham has a dark brown color and you can't see through it even when you only have a teaspoon full of it. The Barry Farm product is clear enough that you can see through it when you pour it into a pint bottle....<br /><br />Won't be buying any more....<br /><br />M. Roberts<br />Loveland, Co

review/text: I ordered a quart of "pure sorghum syrup" and it was delivered in good condition, packaged well, and arrived quickly to my doorstep.  That is where the compliments end.  This was not sorghum.  It was pale and sweet with a weird aftertaste, and had a taste more like karo corn syrup than anything that is like sorghum molasses.  I was very disappointed and had to throw it out since no one would eat it.  If you like karo corn syrup on your pancakes this is for you.  Sadly not for me.

review/text: The sorghum syrup arrived promptly, and was also well-packaged. The flavor, however, was far from what I had in mind. My last sample of sorghum was from a farm in Mississippi. But they don't ship. Anywhere. Cash and carry at the mill. Too far from here. This didn't have the texture and appearance I was expecting; it was pale and cloudy and certainly didn't have the flavor. It's hard to taste a product over the internet! But when you pour it over a fresh biscuit, it's flavor improves greatly!

But if you just want good food you're out of luck.  What's inside the package are not the glowing orange apricots shown in Amazon's listing.

review/text: I bought one of these edible images after a co-worker raved about how easy it was to use. I bought the shopping girl image because it went perfectly with the theme of our party. After frosting the cake, I was ready to apply the image to the top of the cake. I followed the directions, but the image would not easily peel off. I put it in the freezer, but it would not come off. I rolled it on the edge of the countertop, but it still would not come off. I eventually had to use a spatula to scrap the image off and it did not come off in one full peice. It ripped in several places that could not be fixed. I had to use it because I did not have a back-up plan.It did not look good. Thankfully my cake and frosting were delicious, so nobody complained about the ripped image. I will probaly not buy another one of the edible images. Sorry! It's such a good idea.

review/text: When I first began looking for an all natural cat food and found this brand, I chose 3 different flavors with this one being one of them.  My 16-year-old male cat just devours this one in one setting.  The others he always leaves some uneaten but not this one!  I have noticed too that the dry flaky skin he had is no more which is so nice on a black coat.  I think I am leaning towards giving him just this one flavor because he loves it so much and won't shut up until I fill his plate every morning.  Thank you Natural Value for such a great product for our pets!

review/text: Who would have guessed that my picky eater would love this cat food! I bought a few cans while I was on vacation earlier this summer. Now he complains if I serve him anything else. He really seems to like the combination of tuna and chicken with a chicken broth 'jelly' on top.  I like it because I can open a fresh 3 ounce can for each feeding, rather than putting the rest of a bigger 6 once can in the refrigerator for later, where it often gets stale under a snap on lid. Besides, my cat hates cold food. If your feline also is a picky eater - give this cat food a try. In addition, I like the convenience of ordering through Amazon, because my local stores don't carry this cat food.

Alas the convenience factor is the reason I keep this brand on hand. When I'm not in a hurry or feeling lazy I open the human cans and mix. Oh and as a reminder, cats should sparingly be fed tuna due to mercury content. I use one 6 oz canned tuna to a lg. can of chicken.

review/summary: Excellent quality sprinkles!
review/text: The color on these was bright and they stuck well to my buttercream without bleeding.  One cupcake I still had after 6 days did have some bleeding on the red ones but in my experience, cupcakes usually don't last that long!

review/summary: blue is not true to color!
review/text: I ordered the blue non pareils, and they were not the same shade of blue shown in the picture.  The real color is a bit lighter and maybe more "aqua."  When sprinkled on white frosting, they did look a bit darker.  So, they worked for what I need, but the color was still disappointing...

review/summary: Organic Coffee
review/text: I use this in my espresso maker, mixed with an organic decaf and the flavor combination is my favorite!  Very rich and smooth; I've found no better cups of coffee in any of the coffee shops.

review/summary: No more hairballs!
review/text: My cat is 8 years old.  She has eaten dry food all of her life.  The past few years she was having more hairballs.  At least once a week she would cough one up.  So, I did some investigating and I decided to switch her over to canned to see if it helped because I was so tired of cleaning them up.  It has helped tremendously!  She doesn't have hairballs anymore and she has put on a little weight.  I think she is much happier with this food as well, she really likes it.  It costs a little more than feeding her dry but it is well worth it!

review/summary: Yummy Glacier Fruits
review/text: Before I purchased this product, I have heard that Fox's Glacier Fruits are amazing in that they contain only real fruit juices. Frankly, I thought that this was just an AD designed to entice buyers, but when I ordered it and had a piece of fruit glacier myself, I can certainly understand why so many people are looking for it and raving about it. Unlike other fruit candies whose 'fruit juice' is only about 001% and the rest are just fructose corn syrup, Fox's Glacier Fruits use fruit juice concentrates . As you put one in your mouth, you can certainly taste the wonderful flavors of lemon, strawberry, etc compared to the other candies flavored with 'unnatural flavor ' that mimics the taste of fruits. Try one and see for yourself.
