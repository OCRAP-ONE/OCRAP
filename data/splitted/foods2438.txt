review/summary: FANTABULOUS! SNAPPY COOKIES
review/text: These are the best ginger snaps we've ever had...gluten free or not!  Very crispy, robust ginger taste and enough clove spice to know what's in the cookie.  All 6 packages arrived uncrushed.  We haven't found a broken cookie yet.  My husband is a meat and potato kind of guy, so gluten free food is torture for him.  These?  He says they are fantastic and place another order quick!

review/summary: Extremely Good Cookies
review/text: I think these are the best gluten-free cookies I've tried. The other Pamela's mini cookies are also very good.  There is a recipe on the back for a cookie crust for desserts. I tried the ginger snap crust and it was a little too much ginger for the delicate tasting filling.  Next time I'll try using less crumbs and sprinkle a little for topping. Haven't tried the chocolate cookies for a dessert crust yet - I ate my 6-bag case too fast!

review/summary: 26 - 28 cookies in bag. Whole family loves this perfect Ginger Snap cookie. Awesome flavor & Crunch. Dairy ,Wheat, & Gluten free
review/text: Has about 28 delicious cookies in bag. This is the perfect ginger snap. Came fesh and crispy just right. Tastes better than the nabisco wheat ones. Awesome taste. A great natural cook that you can taste all the flavorful ingredients.<br /><br /> My 8 year old said his first cookie put wings on his head and he flew up to heaven they were so good.<br /><br />Needless to say they are awesome. The perfect crunch cookie that is my whole family's new favorite.<br /><br />If you like molasses cookies or gingerbread you will love these.<br /><br /> Do not know about the other reviewer, but mine did snap.

review/text: This is the cookie I always wanted: oreo flavor without that weird "creme" filling, crispy on the outside, moist and slightly chewy on the inside. Perfect.<br /><br />They're so decadent, even my cookieholic self is sated with only two.<br /><br />I bought my bag at a store, so maybe I got a fresher batch than some of the other reviewers. I found nothing to complain about here texturally. This is not "pretty good for gluten-free", this is fan-freakin-tastic.  Finding these delights has made my life just a little bit better. Seriously.

review/summary: Autism Diet Cookie
review/text: Medical studies have demonstrated that autistic children are more receptive to their therapy when on a strict gluten free diet.  The problem is that children love to eat tasty chocolaty 'junk' food things.  So how to satisfy their taste buds and maintain a gluten free diet?  Alot of the gluten free stuff out there is non-palatable.<br /><br />After MUCH trial and error we discovered this delicious chocolate chip cookie.  We performed a blind taste test with all the Dream Factory tribe and this cookie stood at the top of the cookie heap.  Flavorful crunchy.  Microwaving for about 20 sec softens them up and brings out their chocolate flavor even more.  Their small size (2" dia) is perfect for little hands.<br /><br />Did you notice on the bags cover;  the cookie on top to the right.  The configuration of the chips makes a sad face.. . .  Look.<br /><br />Pamelas also makes a great pancack mix.

review/summary: I can have cookies, and be gluten free! YAY!
review/text: I actually bought these at a local natural/health food market. They were insanely expensive and I wish I would have tried amazon first! Still, I LOVE these cookies, I got the EXTREME chocolate mini cookies and they're delicious! Even my kids like them and they can be fairly picky. They're loving getting to try all of my "new gluten-free things!", and I may be moving them gluten-free as well.<br /><br />These cookies have a wonderful flavor, texture, and crunch. I find myself happy with just 2-4 of them, instead of just wanting to devour the entire package considering the small size of the cookies. Size wise they remind me of the chocolate chip cookies you can get in that mixed pack of grandma cookies? I think that's what they are, they have the frosted animal cookies, and those chocolate chip ones. Anyway, they're smaller cookies, good flavor, good crunch, gluten-free and great price here at amazon. What more can you really ask for anymore? ;)

review/text: Our whole family loves these ginger snap cookies.  We have tried all 3 varieties, and they are all great.  I last ordered the ginger snaps in December, and they were about $3 per bag.  When I went to reorder, the price had gone up significantly ( to about $5).  I noticed the other 2 varieties were available through Amazon and are still reasonably priced, and this one is available through Nutricity.  Please make this variety available again through Amazon. Pamela's makes awesome bread mix and pancake mix, too.

review/text: Now that my doctor & I have decided that a gluten-free diet would be a help with some GI difficulties, the adventure to find healthy snacks that won't cause any  problems has begun. The first item I've added to my list of new favorite treats are these Pamela's mini ginger snaps (or should I say snapz!) There really crunchy, just the way I like a cookie and very flavorful. They're great with a coffee or the traditional cold glass of milk. These are, indeed, among the best ginger snaps of any sort, gluten-free or otherwise, that you are likely to find. Delicious anytime!

review/summary: Pamela's Ginger Snapz - 4 out of 5.
review/text: I am allergic to wheat, soy, corn, and peanuts. I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all.

review/summary: If You're Watching Your Weight, Beware !
review/text: Don't panic..........they won't make you fat unless you eat too many which is easy because they are so yummy !<br /><br />Somehow, these cookies are a tiny bit chewy but not soft AND they have a slight crunch when you bite into one.  They are just right as far as I'm concerned and hard to put down.  In addition, there are a ton of chocolate chips in these cookies.  They would remind you a bit of Famous Amos' tiny chocolate chip cookies, although not as crunchy.  It's hard to believe that these cookies are gluten-free.  I looked at the ingredients a couple of times to make sure.<br /><br />I keep the bags of cookies in the freezer(summer heat) and they are just as good after thawing as they were right out of the shipping box, so don't worry about a chocolatey mess in the heat.<br /><br />These are hard to find in the stores AND the price here on Amazon is really low when compared with the local health food store. Hard to beat this deal.  Highly recommended.

review/text: ...this is a darn good product!<br /><br />Pamela has long been known for her excellent gluten/wheat and dairy free products.  Her baking mixes are nonpareil.  So are these cookies.  I attended an Autism Fair on July 24, 2010 and these cookies were being passed out as free samples.  People descended on those cookies like a flock of falcons and I felt lucky to be able to snag one.  Even so, they were a BIG hit and I ended up getting a bag for guests.  Within minutes those cookies were gone.<br /><br />Hats off to Pamela!  (You will also want to check her website for more good recipes and products).

review/summary: Pamela's Simplebites Chocolate Chip Mini Cookies
review/text: OMG! So the kids say these days. We just ordered these a week ago because my wife LOVES to bake, but can't eat wheat products anymore. I ordered these for her to try and BINGO she ate almost the whole bag at one sitting! She never eats that many cookies at a time...I tried them and of course I finished off the bag. These products on Amazon.com are wonderful and very helpful for people who are allergic to wheat. My wife can enjoy eating similar meals with me now without fear of a reaction. She's tried the Ener-G bread, the Bob's Gluten Free flour and the cereal w/berries.  She's in heaven, (NOT physically) and is enjoying eating again. This week we're going to try the gluten free, wheat free pasta with homemade tomatoe sauce and hamburger meatballs. I'm excited to sit down to dinner with her and I'm trying these products also.  Anyway, these cookies are wonderful and taste just like regular flour made products. Would recommend any of these gluten free, wheat free products on Amazon.com. We rate this product a 10 and will continue to purchase them.

review/text: edited- These cookies are quite good! But *only* if you microwave them. I put them in usually about 30 secs, butyou just have to do it till you can tell its softened. If you dont heat it, then you can't taste the chocolate chips at all and as a result is really unsatisfying. Although, in my opinion w a really good snack you shouldnt have to do anything to it. But, w.e.<br />In conclusion- these r realli good and youll get your $ worth, subscribe its only like $2.30 for each 7 oz packet. But, dont eat these unless you have a microwave at hand, or it really isnt good otherwise.

review/text: These cookies are so good that its a bit difficult to stop eating them ... and though "gluten free," they are not dietetic, so beware.  One other caution ... I had purchased some at Whole Foods, and then decided to buy more through Amazon. I think the ones that arrived via Amazon were not as good ... like maybe they were from a different cooking date/lot that had been baked a little too long. They were still good enough to eat, but I noticed a slight difference. However, the convenience of being able to shop online and the fact that even those cookies from the "bad lot" were very enjoyable, somehow makes it worth giving a second chance( with the hope that it was just one time they were overdone).

However, when I ordered them from amazon every other bag was stale even within the expiration date the taste was not the same. I was super dissapointed and it even prevented me from ever buying these again.

review/text: My kids are allergic to dairy and are also gluten intolerant.  These cookies are the next best thing to homemade.  All 3 of my kids love them!  I love them, too, because it takes the pressure off a bit to always have baked treats handy!  We will definitely be keeping stocked up on these!

review/summary: Very, very tasty. Wouldn't know they're gluten free.
review/text: These cookies have a very similar taste and texture to Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies, if you remember those from your gluten-eating days. There is a slight caramel-like aftertaste and a bit of a gritty finish from the rice flour, but I doubt that anyone would be able to tell they're not "normal" cookies. If you prefer your cookies crunchy, get these. If you prefer softer cookies, the WOW Baking brand is excellent.

review/text: There are an awful lot of gluten-free products I don't really care for, including Pamela's full-size chocolate chip cookies. They are nasty.

review/text: These have been my favorite ginger cookies for about a year now. They're getting harder to find as they gain popularity - my local store is frequently sold out.<br /><br />They're crazy delicious - I need to start buying them by the case. If you haven't tried them, you're in for a treat! Or, I should say "don't try them" - put them back on the shelf in case I'm cruising down the cookie aisle - you're making it too hard for me to find them!!!<br /><br />Seriously, run, don't walk, and try these asap! You won't regret it.<br /><br />FYI: the case price on Amazon is very good and beats the local stores in my area by quite a margin - something to consider.

review/text: I wanted these for a crust for pumpkin cheesecake, but they didn't quite make it in time. No matter, we enjoyed them right out of the box. They are packed full of flavor. The big question, as with all GF baked goods, is texture. These cookies are excellent, very crunchy without being at all crumbly or sandy. If you've ever enjoyed Ppefferneuse, these will take you there. They are exactly like that, right down to the possibility of a cracked tooth. And that's not a negative, it's part of the charm. Really, they're good cookies, with outstanding ginger flavor. Mom says these are every bit as good as the Ppefferneuse she made for Christmas every year, and that's high praise.

review/text: Being a fan of Pamela's products, I had no hesitation in trying the chocolate chip mini cookies. These remind me of any store-bought, traditional gluten-filled chocolate chip cookie in that they taste normal and are not chalky and dry like so many other gluten free cookies out there. I like the size of these cookies because you feel like you are getting more out of your snack than one signle larger cookie. They are the perfect size for my children (who also love them) and the chocolate doesn't melt too fast and make a big mess. Yum!

review/text: But this one hits the mark. One of the hardest things to replicate in gluten free items is texture. I do not like soft cookies so I am delighted with this product. When non-celiac friends are over, I make sure I have a couple bags because if they get into them, they disappear pronto. Nice ginger "bite" to the flavor profile too. I have yet to not be thrilled by any of the Pamela's products that I have purchased! Buy these cookies by the case from Amazon; this will save you money, insure freshness, and they are delivered right to your door if your total order is over $25.

review/summary: Warning! Watch expiration date.
review/text: Both of my children are on a gluten free diet. We eat a lot of these cookies and highly recommend them. I am not a fan of all gluten free options.<br /><br />The only thing to watch is the expiration date. We bought a clearance listing of the chocolate chip cookies from amazon (from amazon but not the full price item). The cookies were close to the expiration date and tasted old and stale - but we know the cookies taste amazing - so I'm sure it was because they were near the expiration. My kids didn't care so they still ate them.<br /><br />We buy these monthly through amazon and we have only had that happen the one time we bought the discounted cookies. My tip is if you do get a stale pack, contact amazon immediately. Amazon will back their products but get a replacement because these cookies are worth trying!<br /><br />This review is specifically about the chocolate chip cookies but we also love the chocolate cookies <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004T348UW">Pamela's Products Simple Bites Wheat-Free Gluten-Free Mini Cookies Extreme Chocolate -- 7 oz</a> and ginger snaps <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ILILM0">Pamela's Products Simplebites Ginger Mini Snapz, 7-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 6)</a>(I HATE ginger snap cookies but love these).

review/text: The first shipment we got was delicious.  The second and third was too.  Then with the fourth shipment I noticed they were crumblier and drier. The next shipment was dull in flavor.  I began realize they were taking out some of the molasses and most of the ginger, which are the main ingredients that make a ginger snap cookie.  Now it's like putting a half cup of  brown sugar in your mouth and good luck trying to swallow it.  Pathetic.  Never  buying again.  I'll find a way to make my own.

review/text: These cookies are amazing! I am on a gluten-free, dairy-free, nut-free, and soy-free diet, which makes it almost impossible to find desserts, candy, or baked goods I can eat. These cookies are free from all these allergens, but more importantly: they are delicious. The Extreme Chocolate ones are crunchy at first, but then they get chewy and melty in your mouth. They feel rich and even buttery, and have a satisfying chocolate taste. Reminded me of brownies. I was very impressed and I would have enjoyed this product equally even if I weren't on a restricted diet. Superthumbs up and THANK YOU for this product!

review/summary: Great cookies, great price, and they're delicious!!!
review/text: Going gluten free is overwhelming, especially when you have trouble finding food that tastes good. All of my experienced friends told me not to eat any prepackaged gluten free stuff until I had been off gluten for at least a week or two. I saw these cookies on sale right before I started, so I bought them planning to wait a week or so, then eat them. Well, I couldn't wait! I was too curious. I tried one, and it was delicious!<br /><br />They are about the same size, and very similar in taste to Famous Amos, only better. They are not as dry. The texture is great, not exactly crunchy, but not quite chewy. They have an initial crunch, a good chew, and sort of melt in your mouth, and are perfect for dunking in milk (taste fantastic with almond milk). There's no funny textures or aftertastes like with some gluten free sweets. I know a lot of people say they can eat a whole bag in one sitting, and I probably could, but I find them to be satisfying enough to just eat the serving size of 4 when I have a sweet craving.<br /><br />The price here is better than in the store, if you get free shipping. At my health food store, they are $3.69/bag. I paid about $16.50 with tax for 6 bags here, and they arrived in 2 days!!! At that price, they don't cost any more than mainstream packaged cookies, which not common with gluten free stuff.<br /><br />The kids love them, the husband (who is not gluten free) loves them, and I love them. What more could you ask for!

review/text: Two of my (four) boys is gluten-free. Pizza is a favorite in our house, and I have been trying to find the perfect GF pizza crust for them. I decided to make this for all of us (my boys and myself) for pizza movie night tonight. My non-GF son and I could not tell the difference in taste from a regular pizza! This has me completely sold. Before we were using Bob's (red mill) pizza crust, but I couldn't eat it myself, so I kept searching.<br />One thing I did differently, that may help someone: I did not have any apple cider vinegar, so I used 1/2 tsp of apple juice and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice. I don't know what it should have tasted like, but it tasted fine to me!<br />I also dusted my hands in GF flour before forming the dough in the pan and it made it much easier to handle (too sticky otherwise). And I also did as the above poster and par-baked the crust before adding the toppings.

review/text: This is a great pizza crust, even for Gluten free-my whole family loves it and I am the only 1 who is GF.  I wish the packaging said how much this box makes.  This used to be sold in a larger size, (5 lb bag) which seems to have dissapeared-someone is making some money off of selling only the single size.  Walmart has started carrying GF foods and they do carry this, the single box is still almost $5.  Follow the directions on the box(I use a wet rubber spatula to spread it in the pan instead of GF flour and hands).  Great for your pizza fix!

review/summary: The best
review/text: These are the best mints we've had. First bought them on a trip to England, and have been getting them ever since. When our grandson was small he'd always ask me for the "ice cube candy", because that's what they look like. Recently I found them on Amazon and was thrilled. They are very hard to find, usually have to ask a friend to bring me some back when she goes home to London to visit family. I ordered several bags of them and surprised my grandson with them. He's 14 years old now and you should have seen the smile on his face when he saw them. They are very refreshing.

review/summary: Not too sweet or bitter, & the mint isnt too strong or weak either. A GREAT candy!
review/text: A friend brought some of these over, & I LOVE them. Normally with mints I tend to be wary because most mints have no flavor & the mint it way too strong, but these arent like that at all. They are sweet but not overly so, & you can actually taste flavor because the mint isnt beyond strong. I really like these, would recommend these, & will buy these in the future :).

review/summary: so-so
review/text: Let me start by saying this is a bit of a solurge item.  For the holidays I thought it would add some nice choices for guests.  I do like the variety, and when people are over, they enjoy browsing and pondering which one to select instead of straight cofee or straight cocoa.  But I really have yet to find one of these that I really love.  I usually used to add a scoop of Swiss Miss to my cuo and then brew a K-cup into the cup.  I acyually like that better.  I get the coffee I prefer and I can add more or less "chocolate.  None of these are very chocolate-y.  Maybe I will find a favorite in the future and  that is the nice t hung about this - a lot of variety and without having to purchase a whole box of each type.  As an example, I was excited about the "mudslide", but was disappointed when I actually tried it.  Sad.

review/summary: Wrong sampler pack
review/text: My wife just resolved an argument about whether we received the hot chocolate sampler I ordered a week or two ago. We both recall receiving the package - I opened it, quickly looked at the printed language in the corners of the box which had the names of different hot chocolates (I didn't actually look at the K-cups themselves) and left it for my spouse to put away. A few days later I was looking for the hot chocolate - and we couldn't find it.  Turns out that despite the packaging the K-cups were NOT hot chocolate but a variety of coffees.  Too late to return it - but beware.

Sometimes I want a strong bold cup, other times I'm craving just a little hit of caffeine.  It's wonderful to get up and have a choice!  I love the hot chocolate, too.  I can use a K cup of hot chocolate and one of coffee and make my own mochas.  Like with the tea sample pack, I get to try all the different kinds of coffees.  It's great to have a choice and know that I'm not stuck with the same bleh coffee every single day.

review/summary: Vitamin E...
review/text: I purchase this all the time although it is not organic. Every week I take what I need and keep the rest in the freezer, double bagged in zip-locks since nuts go rancid due to the oil content. Almonds are high in vitamin E which is great for my skin. I place twenty almonds in a cup of water every night to consume it in the morning since it becomes softer and tastier without damaging my teeth. This is one nut that I take with me in prescription containers with some water when I go mountain biking and surfing since that is when I need healthy calories and vitamin E, exposed to the sun without sunscreen so I can get my vitamin D from the sun. Bravo.

review/summary: It's a Good Product.
review/text: I've been trying to reorient my diet such that I eat much less animal products and much more fresh fruits, dried fruits,  fresh vegetables and nuts. My goal is to eat much less refined sugars. trans-fats, animal fats and cholesterol. Supposedly, this should help my health in a number of ways. So far the only noticeable things are a drop in weight and blood pressure. That's a start, a good start.<br /><br />One of the items I'm increasing is nuts and seeds. I find a good place to get these items in bulk quantity is Costco, particularly with their Kirkland Signature brand. Of course, a lot of people don't live anywhere near a Costco, but the branded items are still easily available online.<br /><br />Yesterday, I picked up a big bag (3 pounds or 48 ounces) of almonds. The almonds are fresh and tasty and unsalted. I actually, prefer salted nuts, but I'm also trying to cut the intake of salt so it's good to find these unsalted ones. The quality is excellent. About the only negative I can note is that the bag doesn't hold up well after being opened so I'll have to transfer the contents to a large zip-lock bag to attempt to maintain freshness. We use these nuts for meals and snacks, plus our three-year-old toddler enjoys them with his meals. It's a good product.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: Great fresh almonds, but I found better
review/text: These are very tasty fresh almonds. The quality is very nice. The price is good too. However, if you do not eat almonds quickly then this bag may be too big for you and they may go bad before you finish them all.<br /><br />I found just as good almonds for slightly cheaper at my Trader Joe's. 1lb for $5 instead of 3lb for $18. This is also nice because I don't have to eat them as fast before they go bad.

review/summary: Almonds are essential food
review/text: Almonds, sunflower seeds, and wheat germ are the only *good* (i.e. high-content) natural sources of vitamin E. Taking E pills is useless and may be harmful, so you gotta stick to natural sources. Interestingly, all of three good sources I've just mentioned mix very well with other foods, so you can eat them with every meal no matter what it is -- just toss some in and it'll be fine. One nuance though: raw almonds are sold at Trader Joe's for about five bucks a pound in one-pound bags w/o any limitations (you can buy one bag). So my recommendation is, by all means, do add almonds to your daily fare, but watch the prices and get them at Trader Joe.

review/summary: Nommy Nom Num!
review/text: This is becoming a real favorite of mine, this one has the benefit of not being coated with powdered sugar which I like as a change while I munch my Turkish Delights.  This has a wonderful texture to it, the coconut is mixed into the matrix throughout each cube with the added taste treat or either a Hazelnut, a Pistachio or an Almond in the center.  This is a really tasty one that has a wonderful mouth feel as you chew it.  Of course if you don't like coconut, this one is definitely NOT for you.<br /><br />For me, the only way this could wind up better would be to mix some dried pineapple into them as well.  These are fantastic but the drawback is the price, they are easily the most expensive Turkish Delights I buy which is why I removed a star from an otherwise five star product.  It might help if they offered some sort of bulk buy like the other flavors that give you the option of buying three packs. Hopefully they'll read this and we''ll see it happen?  I know I'd buy these three boxes at a time, they are that good.

review/summary: Thy motherload..
review/text: So i always thought one had to dig a while before striking the "motherload" but this little turkish load hold`s a place of their own. Now i only tried turkish delight once before directly from Turkey and that was "uncut" and more firm....yadayadayada...more chewing resistance yadyadayada...but the coconut sprinkle and the presence of nuts wil l give you the chewing resistance needed, because they are rather soft to the bite..almost as winegum wich may be a bit on the soft side. But you certainly get an impression of freshness when biting into these XL sugarbite sized candys. And one more thing, they taste pretty good and they have a nice presentation "feature" One star taken as they are a bit too soft to the bite...and munching away at these will land you in the bathroom in the middle of the night..you can take that from me.<br /><br />UPDATE: my other pack which i just dug into had the "right" density or chewing resistance if you will. This will make your chewing muscles work for their money. Just how i like it! 5 stars.

review/summary: A Nice if not Earth-Shattering Chocolate Bar
review/text: The company I bought them from (via Amazon), VitaCost, did an awesome packing and shipping job.  I would highly recommend them (and shipping was free with a reasonable minimum order amount).  They also shipped a large order very fast.<br /><br />These did arrive soft from melting, however the wrappers didn't leak, and I was able to just put them into the frig for a while to fix that.  (Not the company's fault  - I live in a hot climate and ordered during the summer, taking a chance that they might arrive melted.)<br /><br />I don't think that the melting altered the flavor, but I wanted to mention that it happened, as I suppose it might have had some effect.  Anyway, these are nice, largish milk chocolate bars.  There are tiny bits of toffee and almonds (apparently; can't really tell what the bits are) distributed throughout.  As noted, I didn't think these additions were very noticeable, mainly just adding a little texture and not much flavor.  I guess you could call this a gentle approach, rather than one where the bar is loaded up with lots of big chunks of ingredients.<br /><br />It's still good though.  I might order these again if the price was right.
