review/summary: Good solid jerky for frequent eaters
review/text: I order this jerky every two weeks on subscription because it is tasty and fits the wallet, too. I like various tastes in other brands from time to time. However, this jerky is the main taste that satisfies the jerky need.

review/summary: If you like Jerky this is the best deal I could find
review/text: I know its not the healthiest snack, but there's nothing as satisfying as a nice quality piece of jerky.  It keeps the hunger away longer than all the various candy, chips and other carb snacks.<br /><br />I have order this double package in both Original and Teriyaki, and is the best price I have found when you figure it down to a per oz price.  It's even cheaper if you add it as a "subscription" to be shipped every 1, 2, 3, or 6 months...which you can cancel at any time.<br /><br />One other use I have for this is an extra special treat for my dog.<br /><br />Anyway, this is always high quality jerky.  Only negative is these large backs end up with a bunch of small crumbled shavings in the bottom--guess what then gets poured onto a plate for my dog!!!

review/summary: Over priced but good flavor
review/text: I would like to see this a few bucks less then it seems like it would be more inline with the value.  At least I can save some money and buy it on the internet  instead of at the store. This is also the best flavor based on the other ones I have tried.  in their line-up. I have tried several of them, and this is the best. As long as I can keep getting this flavor, I will keep sticking choices. This is the best beef Jerky I have ever had. I have been eatting it for years now, and another positive is that it is made in Wisconsin. My only wish is that you could buy this stuff in better quanitity discounts. The small bags are nice for day trips, but it would nice to be able to buy in larger bags for additional discounts.

review/text: Pepper adds a nice kick to beef jerky, and Jack Link makes a nice line of beef jerky. Some of the slices are a bit thin and tough, so personally I like the peppered jerky that is sold at Aldi's grocery stores, but if you don't have an Aldi's in your area, Jack Link's makes a good product, with a nice jerky/peppery taste. Yum.

review/summary: Wish They Were in China
review/text: I live in China, and I am unable to find anything made by Jack Link's here. I am able to buy different beef jerky products here, but they just don't taste the same. Fortunately my mother-in-law and wife gift me with Jack Link's beef jerky on a regular basis. Jack Link's uses premium cuts of meat that are seasoned and smoked in a way that you will find to be delicious. Once you open the bag, be sure to put it in the fridge unless you want your beef jerky to grow some white fuzz. An opened bag of beef jerky that is refrigerated can last for months. I also recommend Jack Link's teriyaki, peppered, sweet & hot, hickory smoked, and steakhouse recipes.

review/text: The wonderful flavor of Jalapeno's in this zip locked bag fills the air once it is opened. I originally purchased this package of Jack Link for snacking but found myself munching until the entire bag is empty. I first across them on store shelfs in Toledo, Ohio and have not been able to find them in any stores in the Fort Worth,Texas area (until my only other source amazon.com). I love the flavor of the Jalapeno and it is spiced just right. Jack Link is great but Carne Seca is one of the best.

Some of them are pretty good (especially Golden Valley products) but overall none are better than Jack Links. Reliably you get tender, tasty and fresh jerky. I like their original flavor the best. It's not too salty, too sweet, or too hard. It's 'just right' in my opinion.

If you put the entire package into your mouth all at once and chew, there is no way you are gonna taste hot.  This beef jerky has about the same hotness as a small package of sweet and sour potato chips.  If I had ordered sweet beef jerky, then this would get 5 stars.  But I didn't want sweet beef jerky.  I wanted sweet and HOT beef jerky.  3 stars because at least it is edible.  But it will probably be a gift to my friend, with a BIG disclaimer about the HOT.

review/summary: Best mass marketed dried meat product ON EARTH
review/text: I'm normally rather "meh" about beef jerky and similar products (e.g. slim jims and their ilk), but Jack Links are always good, and the sweet and hot variety, for whatever reason, is AMAZING.  So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of.

I decided to make it as a 5 gal batch instead of a 6 gal because I prefer a full bodied wine and the last time I made a 6 gal kit as a 6 gal batch it came out rather thin tasting. All the ingredients you need are in the kit including the rather nice surprise of corks, foils and labels. The instructions are simple and easy to follow, the hard part is not drinking it all at once. I definitely recommend it to fruit wine aficionados.

I should've known the Corunucopia brand wouldn't let me down. Not only does this have a different flavor, but the added sweetness that is typical of the Cornucopia kits is just right. Not the sweetest of them all however. I prefer this wine very chilled.

How in the world did you get a nut-based non-dairy product to taste like ice cream? I followed the directions on the label and let the Ice Supreme sit a while at room temperature, and get "spoon soft," Fabulous! As I get older, I'm paying more attention to what I put into my body, and it's a joy to read an ingredient label that does not have the multi-syllable additives, preservatives, and other hard to pronounce chemicals. Just old fashion all natural ingredients like grandma would use. Thanks for such a great product, my favorite being "Pecan Passion." The whole pecans on top are like a gift. Thanks again.

review/summary: my friends wanted to know "what is that scent?"
review/text: I love the full crisp scent of this product. Evidently others do also. When I wear this product, friends as well as strangers inquire "What is that lovely scent?" It always lifts my spirits to apply it and I also often use it in my bed linens just to please myself. Everytime I wear Dove go fresh Energizing Body Mist, I just feel better. After much searching I was glad to find my favorite on Amazon. Needless to say, I stocked up and am glad I did!

review/summary: Not the Product in the Bottle
review/text: This is NOT the original scent from Dove in the containers.  I've been using this product bought from stores and as I was getting low on my last 2 bottles (home and travel) I looked for them in stores but couldn't find this scent.  The original or REAL product has a strong scent that is refreshing.  What came in the containers was not even a hint of the scent but rather an alcohol mist.  I will assume that it was reconstituted with the essence of the original inside the container.  I am returning this product and reporting it as fraud.

The tins are so cute and lively and the tea is simply superb, like all Ahmad teas.<br /><br />This pack of 4 is a great deal, btw. Perfect for gift giving or sharing with family and friends.<br /><br />And the lovely tins make wonderful containers for crafts or in the kitchen for things like whole nutmeg, star anis, laurel leaves, etc.<br /><br />Great product.

review/summary: Great Flavor & HOT
review/text: This sauce isn't a traditional Szechuan flavor, meaning it is not made with Szechuan peppercorns. It is much tastier than Hunan and quite a bit hotter. If you love the heat, add half a bottle to your stir fry. If you don't like the heat so much, you can add considerably less and still benefit from the flavor. I can no longer find this at my local grocery stores, so I will have to order some.<br /><br />This is how I cook with this sauce:<br />Prepare your stir fry and when it is almost done, make a sauce out of 1/2 C. cold water, 2 Tbs. corn starch (mix together before you add anything else), 1 Tbs. sugar, 1/4 C. Szchwn sauce (just dump some in!), 1 Tbs. teriyaki sauce, 1 Tbs. soy sauce. Mix together. Add to your stir fry and cook on high heat until the corn starch goes clear.

review/summary: Yet Another Impulse Item.
review/text: Shopping in one of those big warehouse club stores is an interesting experience. You wander around with this huge shopping cart looking at piles of stuff that you otherwise wouldn't be looking for and all of a sudden another impulse item goes into the cart. Take the other day, for example. We wandered down a food isle and there sat a palette of Kirkland Signature 100% Pure Maple Syrup. Well, we eat pancakes now and then, but we don't use maple syrup. It's just too expensive. We use  Aunt Jemima Butter Rich Syrup. But, there was this hugh display of Maple Syrup. Hmmmmmm. Well, maybe we deserve a treat now and then. After all, we've earned it by all the money we've saved on the other items. Another impulse item goes into the cart.<br /><br />Well, we've now been eating pancakes more frequently and I suspect that will last for a while. Mmmmmm, is that 100% maple syrup ever good! Boy, it sure beats Aunt Jemima. No contest. It was a little thinner and watery than I had anticipated, but what a delicious flavor! I felt like licking the plate when the pancakes were all gone. Why is it so much better? Well, I looked at the ingredients. The Kirkland Signature syrup had only one ingredient: pure maple syrup. The Aunt Jemima had 12 ingredients starting with corn syrup and high-fructose corn syrup and ending with carmel color. One was all natural and the other was a manufactured concoction. Well, maybe the higher cost was worth it. After all, we don't use much syrup on a per breakfast basis and the 32-ounce bottle should last a long time. Mmmmm. I asked my wife when we're having pancakes again.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: I love this syrup! I can't go back to regular store bought syrup after trying this real maple syrup!  The price is excellent & it arrived pretty quickly after I ordered it.  I would highly recommend this syrup. Real maple syrup is much better for you than corn syrup immitation syrup you get in the store like Aunt Jemima or Log Cabin. I will never buy corn syrup again.

review/summary: great product, great price!
review/text: I have to admit as far as this little luxury of maple syrup goes it's all about price. Kirkland products tend to be of good quality and fair pricing though, so, always a good place to start.<br /><br />Since maple syrup is a single ingredient food and not something I eat every day I really don't find all that much variation in taste from one brand to the next. This Kirkland syrup tastes just as good as about any other with *important consideration* for comparisons being fair, i.e of the same color+grade. I did not find this to be thinner than other brands either.<br /><br />Great on pancakes, waffles, crepes, aebleskiver. I've also recently started experimenting with using maple syrup instead of sugar in for certain recipes as it is a more pure, less processed form of sweetening.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and recommended.

And when you do have pancakes, you're sure to impress all of your guests.<br /><br />I like to heat this up before serving.<br /><br />It does seem a little thinner than the fake syrups I've been eating.

review/text: I've tried a number of Bar Harbor products and was favorably impresses with all. As such, I picked up a can of Bar Harbor New England Style Salmon Chowder. It was just excellent! Good taste and texture. Rich and creamy with nicely defined potato chunks. It says that the soup is condensed and they suggest that milk and butter may be added. However, at the time I didn't have any milk (other than chocolate) so I proceeded without additions. It just couldn't have been any better. Well, perhaps the sodium is a bit high. But it's all natural with no preservatives or MSG. I'll be back again!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

I recently bought tendons and trachea for them but my 17 years old boy was having hard time enjoying those.. so, I bought these lungs and he can't get enough of it!! It's not hard and it's not really chewy, the texture is fluffy like popcorn! You can easily break them into small pieces, so they are great for big or small dogs. Would recommend for senior babies with hard time chewing treats. It's got a bit of a smell but it disappear fairly quickly and does not stain the carpet. Will definitely buy more!!

review/summary: My little girl sheltie loves a piece of lung for breakfast
review/text: I give my 30 lb sheltie about half a piece of lung every morning for her (first) breakfast.  Breaking them up is kinda weird, the lungs tend to turn to powdery bits when I try to break them, so I guess I'll just have to give her a whole piece of lung from now on, huh? ^_^<br /><br />The smell of these is similar to dried green tripe, quite stinky, but disappears once she's eaten it.  She *LOVES* the smell of the lungs, though I don't, so I hurry up and give it to her and seal up my ziploc again before I smell it too much.  With a light and airy crunch to these beef lungs (the sound of her eating these reminds me of munching on popcorn), they aren't a replacement for rawhide, bones, or other similar long-lasting chews.  It only takes my dog a few minutes to eat hers, but she's a slow, lady-like eater, not a gulper.  There's a lot of lung for 1 lb, I filled 2 gallon-sized Ziplocs with the 1 lb, and they're a great price.  For what they are as treats, they're a great natural product to give to your dog.

Personally, I dont think I would order them again, but would instead go back to the ears or something a little more crunchy. These are basically like 1/4" to 1/2" pieces of skin that have been smoked until cured. Though they are a little crunchy they are more like ummm think of a styrofoam texture.<br /><br />The product was well packaged and I would order from the company again, just would get something different.

review/summary: Great flavor for a grated Parmesan cheese!
review/text: I'm used to using freshly grated cheese from a wedge of Parmesan.  The flavor and texture really can't be beat.  When I think of grated parmesan from a jar, I think of caustic tasting kind that comes in a green can.  I decided to try Delallo cheese based on the great reviews on Amazon.  I'm glad I did, because it's really good!  The flavor isn't as deep as you would get in a freshly grated cheese, but it's pretty good for a canned cheese.  The flavor is a little milder and doesn't have that harsh aftertaste that I detect from the one in the green can.  It's more nutty, less sharp. I don't think it would make a good substitute for fresh grated in recipes where the Parmesan flavor should be more pronounced, but I think it's perfect for topping pasta.<br /><br />Note that this isn't pure grated cheese.  It contains corn flour and cellulose to prevent the cheese from caking. Potassium sorbate is added to prevent loss of flavor.

review/text: I bought this thinking it would be "outstanding" Grated Parmesan, and it stacks up all its Parmesan flavor really well. To tell you the truth, it reminds me of some health food store brand that is not that well known. I put it on a veggie pizza, eggs, soup, salad, pasta, etc. Not bad to add to everything you eat. I'll go for another supply here next time.  You'll get used to it in time.  I've already used up 20 of the bottles in soups, or for my pet mice.

review/summary: Worst Valentine's Cards Ever
review/text: My eight year old son picked these out in January because he loves Star Wars. He was so excited to give them to his friends. We opened them on February 12 to start addressing them. The first disappointment was to find that although the box advertises 32 cards in four designs, there were only two designs in our box--28 C3POs/R2D2s and 4 Darth Mauls. There were no Darth Vaders or Yodas. This felt like false advertising, as one would assume that in a box of 32 cards, you would receive 8 of each of the 4 designs printed on the box. The second disappointment was to realize that although the box shows a picture of a white area on which to address the Valentine's cards, the actual valentines are small, clear plastic bags with no white space on which to write. There is clear crimping (where the package is heat sealed) that has To: and From: tinily printed on it. Even with a sharpie, we were unable to write legibly on the small crimped plastic area. This also felt like false advertising, as one would assume the product would look like the picture on the box. The third disappointment was to realize that the lollipops are made in China. I'm sorry, but after the multiple melamine scares and the lack of clear food/health standards in China, I refuse to allow my kids to eat any candy that is made in China. I'm certainly not going to have my kids give the candy out to their friends.<br /><br />My son was pretty disappointed in these Valentines. Needless to say, we went out 2 days before Valentine's Day and had to buy new cards.

One day, a co-worker walked in and said, "Oh wow, Buttered Popcorn is my favorite!" Subsequently, I was surprised to discover that this flavor has an almost cult-like following. I guess it just reaffirms the diverse nature of individuality. As the old saying goes, "one man's junk is another man's treasure."

review/text: I have been a huge fan Aero bars for years, but up until recently they were difficult to find in the US. While Nestle makes great chocolate-Cadbury dairy milk chocolate is better. Cadbury seems to have altered their formula very little (if at all) to make the bubble chocolate bars, and you can taste the full creamy Cadbury chocolate in each bite. The bubbles in the chocolate take a little getting used to, and not everyone is a fan. For me, it is a fun texture thing and because Cadbury did a great job with the formula for these bars-the chocolate is just as rich.<br /><br />Some people love bubble chocolate-and some people don't, but if you are looking for a new fun treat, give it a shot!<br /><br />As is the case with most well made milk-chocolate bars they melt very easily at room temperature, so it is best to keep in the fridge.<br /><br />ingredients I got off the package: full cream milk, sugar, cocoa butter, cocoa mass. milk solids, emulsifiers (soya lecithin, 476) flavors.

review/summary: Perfect solution for gummy addiction
review/text: One reviewer rated this product poorly on account of soy being an ingredient.  I personally think that is a pretty silly reason to rate this with one star.  "All natural" does not necessarily mean that it contains no products that can cause allergies.  Anything you might hand out to your kid's friends could potentially have some allergy-causing ingredient in it and therefore parents of highly allergic kids must take responsibility to let everyone who has interaction with their child know. But away from this, these fruit gummies are excellent! I have two little gummy addicts in the house who ask for "gummy packs" throughout the day and thinking of all those artificial colors going into their little bodies on a daily basis horrified me.  They love these every bit as much as the junk food ones.  They taste the same but are natural.  Well worth the few extra bucks spent!

review/text: I usually buy Annie's Fruit Snacks b/c they are sweetened with fruit juices - no sugar.  I decided to try these b/c they contain veggies, they were cheap, and I assumed that an apple company would sweeten their "natural" fruit snacks with juice, as well.<br /><br />However, BEFORE I purchased them, I contacted Mott's to find out the ingredients (b/c they are not included anywhere on the amazon description).  It was an odd situation b/c the response I got directed me to contact another company but assured me that this product was made with real fruit (which it is - it just contains other not necessary stuff).  The other company never responded to my request for a list of ingredients.  I'm embarrassed to say that the price suckered me in and I ended up buying 80 pouches of sugar.<br /><br />NTS, I will be returning to Annie's and will be placing my order soon b/c I'm not feeding my kid bags of refined sugar as a snack.<br /><br />What's really weird is that when the package arrived and I tried to find the list of ingredients, it was covered by a big upc label of some sort.  Like they need to hide the ingredients even after you've purchased.<br /><br />Not sure what I will do with my box of sugar.

review/summary: Great Fruit Snacks!
review/text: I absolutely love these, healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. A fruit snack made with vegetable juice is an amazing invention! Any way to slip veggies in a treat gets 5 stars in my book. I love fruit snacks, but am kind of particular about them. These ones are great! The flavors are really good. I am both partial to the apple shaped one, tastes more like a cherry flavor however. Texture is also really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. You don't have to sit there chewing forever, but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only fruit snacks that I have had that is in my opinion slightly better than these, is Annie's brand and Ocean Spray. However, Annie's is at least double (closer to triple) the price of these, and neither of those brands offer a vegetable medley option. I definitely recommend this product =)

When I saw that I could buy them online by the box, I was thrilled because the sesame Seed ones aren't easy to find in the local grocery stores.<br /><br />Although they arrived in a timely manner, they weren't packed well enough to cut down on breakage. That wasn't the worst part though. Having eaten these for a year or more, I've had fresh ones from the local stores. The ones I received here didn't taste fresh and sometimes tasted stale.With rice cakes, that makes a big difference.<br /><br /> I think I'll keep to the local stores and take my chances at fresh packages.

The cast are great in this movie as they all seem to give a 110% into their characters and while for obvious reasons some of the effects will seem dated they will still make you give a laugh as y see the hijinx of Beetlejuice in action.
