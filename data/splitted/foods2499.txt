review/summary: The end of a long search for great decaf
review/text: After buying my Keurig (Signature model with the expanded water reservoir), I tried several different decaf options in search of a decaf with real flavor.<br /><br />To be honest, my favorite doesn't come in Keurig format - Trader Joe's French Roast decaf. So I was searching for something close, since using the do-it-yourself K-cup accessory results in too much cleaning for where my Keurig is located: in my cube at work.<br /><br />So I tried: Donut Hole Decaf - meh<br />  Newman's Own Decaf - much better, but still a lighter roast than I wanted<br />  San Francisco Bay French Roast Decaf - was so bad I got a refund from Amazon (thank you!)<br />  Tully's Decaf - very good, but not quite it<br />  Green Mountain Dark Magic Decaf - excellent<br /><br />and finally...<br />  Emeril's Jazzed-Up Decaf - outstanding!!<br /><br />I drink mine black, and want to taste the flavor resulting from the roast. Emeril's has a rich set of flavors typical of a great French Roast, and smells fantastic. Most people that smell it can't believe it's decaf.<br /><br />A simply wonderful product. My hat's off, Emeril!

review/summary: Weak
review/text: I expected a better product because it's Emeril and since its called jazzed up I thought it would be strong. Not the case at all. Its just plain old decaf coffee. Nothing special about it. Its weak and not jazzed up at all. Since Emeril is located in New Orleans, I thought maybe it would include chicory or something from that area that would make it a better coffee but that's not the case.  If you want a dissappointment try it. If you like weak coffee try it. But, otherwise, keep walking.

review/text: This Emeril's Jazzed up Decaf taste very good.  My only reticence is that I'm wondering if it has some caffeine in it.  When I have caffeine, I get a sort of a increased blood pressure buzz.  I had that type of buzz after having this coffee.  My wife had the type of feeling in her stomach that she gets when she has caffeine.  I have no way to test the ingredients to be sure.  But I wonder if this coffee is so "jazzed up" that it has a little caffeine.  It would be interesting to see what other people's experience is.<br /><br />UPDATE: - I've now tried this coffee a dozen times...I think it is safe to say that it has no caffeine.  I haven't had the "buzz" I described above.  But the coffee sure does taste good, so I increased my rating to 5 stars.

review/text: My husband wanted this coffee maker, not me. I thought it was too expensive (still do) and the coffee was too expensive (still do). We bought the Newman's decaf and really liked it, when we were in a hurry the coffee maker is great. I decided to give another decaf a try and tried Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf. It is a great coffee, no after taste and a good rich coffee. My son who drinks only reg. coffee does not know the difference with Emeril's. It's still over priced but it's good. I am not a big coffee drinker, one cup in the morning is about it but I like this one.

review/text: I have been buying Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf Coffee Keurig K-Cups for several months, and I've always liked it. Unfortunately, the batch I most recently received, with a use-by date of April 24/2012, seems to have about half the usual amount of coffee in the cups. The result is coffee that is weak and watery, unless I set the coffee maker on the smallest cup (espresso size).

review/text: I ordered this coffee based upon Emeril's reputation in the food industry and the fact that it's called "Jazzed Up".  I generally buy Starbucks or other premium coffees but Starbucks isn't out in a k-cup yet.  I am still in shock about how bad this Emeril decaf is.  I can't even say it's like poor quality grocery store level - it's seriously revolting.  I tried another one just to make sure I didn't get a 'bad' k-cup, but it was just as horrible.  So now I have 48 of these putrid things left.  Wonder if Amazon will take them back?!

It is still a little too weak, but is head and shoulders above all the other decaf's I've tried.  I've heard that Coffee People Decaf French Roast is superior, but I've had a hard time finding it in stock anywhere.  So until I do find it, Emeril's Jazzed Up will be my decaf of choice.  I'm about to put in my second order. I'm also thinking that a different K cup machine (eg Cuisinart) might result in a better extraction thereby making a stronger brew???  Any thoughts?  Thanks.

review/text: As a fan of the regular Big Easy Bold coffee cups, I did not hesitate to order the decaf, expecting the same depth and richness.

The next time I brewed it using the 6oz water selection, and it was better, though still not as I had expected.  Next time I order I will go back to Green Mountain French Roast decaf, which I still have to brew at 6oz, but has the richness I expect.  46 pods to go..............

review/summary: Perfect for my dog :)
review/text: My Australian Shephard goes crazy for this! I used to get her the Purina Pro Plan Sensitive Stomach product for her but she got tired of the same flavor (salmon), the only flavor it comes in. So I switched out to Natural Choice to try it out and we're sticking to this product. What I love most about this is that it comes several flavors especially for dogs with sensitive stomachs and for a decent price! It may be a few dollars more than other brands out there like Purina and Beneful, but I'll spare a few more dollars for my shephard if it means that she won't have digestion problems any more! (P.S. I bought this through Amazon because the $$$ can't be beat by the big name pet stores for both the 15-lb and 30-lb products...AND it was free prime shipping! :))

review/text: This is now the ONLY cocoa mix I buy! It is soooo good. I like how the ingredients are better than the other big brands. I can't do alot of dairy products and most other companies slam their mixes with milk powders. This one does not. I use it in my cereal to make it chocolatey and also on toast to make choco toast under the broiler. mmmmm

review/summary: Like underripe grapes.
review/text: This beverage tastes distinctly like the underripe green grapes we used to eat from the vine in my aunt's yard.  Tart, sweet, sour, and refreshing.  If I did a blind taste test I would have assumed that this was a bottle of juice from those very same grapes as opposed to the combination of elderflowers and lemon juice that it is.  It is a pretty good drink, but I don't know how soon I'd be willing to pay $30 bucks (shipping plus cost) for it again.

review/summary: Like Summer in a Bottle
review/text: This is truly a unique soft drink--it's literally flavoured with flower blossoms. Elderflower has a curious pungency, a little muskier than honeysuckle in my opinion.  Belvoir Fruit Farms have sweetened this sparkling drink just enough and added a hint of lemon juice for balance.  Belvoir's beverages contain no corn syrup, artificial flavourings or colourings, or preservatives.<br />Elderflower is used medicinally to treat respiratory complaints, and I think drinking this lovely beverage does help stave off colds, etc.  It's more economical (as well as "greener") to purchase this as the cordial (a concentrated syrup) and mix it with your own sparkling water; I find that the cordial keeps very well (3+ weeks) if refrigerated, and I enjoy it even more mixed with a very tart fruit juice (like unsweetened pomegranate).  You can find elderflower and elderberry drinks and other edibles all over the UK--I'm delighted to have access to them here!

review/summary: really good -- don't let the name fool you  :-)
review/text: I was looking for some kind of new trail mix snack food to try, and stumbled across "Barnacles".  My first thought was I'd stumbled into the Amazon Bait Shop, but don't you make that mistake:  these things are pretty tasty.<br /><br />Barnacles are similar enough to traditional trail mixes that you won't feel like you're eating something crazy or peculiar, and the familiar favorites are there:  nuts, little cracker and pretzel pieces, garlic bagel chips, and a few things the Blue Crab Bay Co. calls "roasted pasta spirals".  There aren't many of those though, and the majority of the snack is nuts and cracker things.  If you like nuts you won't mind at all, since they used oversized peanuts which are crunchy and good.<br /><br />The seasoning is a spicy salt blend ("Chesapeake Bay Seasoning") and has a little kick -- nothing severe, but if you're looking for something which is only salty, this might not be for you.  Probably similar to a hot-ish BBQ potato chip for comparison's sake on the heat/spice level.<br /><br />If you like any kind of trail mix the Barnacles are definitely worth a try.

review/text: Subtle and delicious flavors. Individually packaged for freshness. Pods are slightly "fat" and work perfectly with Senseo. Pressure brewing then yields the ultimate cup of coffee. If you're going to adulterate with cream and sugar, you're wasting your money.<br /><br />I usually have one on Saturday morning. Too expensive to drink the other days of the week. Real Kona coffee isn't cheap from any source though. The Kona coffee that comes from Senseo or you sometimes see in grocery stores is 5% or 10% Kona. Meaningless.

The taste is good too, with some sweetness from the liquorice and even a pleasant hint of curry (I think from the fenugreek), which is better than it sounds.<br /><br />They lose a star because, like many companies, they seem to insist on pointless strings and tags stapled onto the bags.  I prefer to just take teabags out with a spoon, then I can squeeze them against the side of the cup.  All the tag does is increase the chance of getting cardboard in your tea if you forget to hold the tag, and make you faff about removing a staple before you can compost them.

review/summary: Great snack with NO SALT !
review/text: I need to limit my salt intake and personally I think that most of us need to. Processed foods are way overly infused with sodium and it is really nice to buy a snack that is actually good enough that it does not need the salt. I am not really a health nut, but believe in eating healthy. But most "healthy snacks" that you might find in the alternative grocery stores are not that great. Most things that I have tried I have not liked. But this has just enough flavor to satisfy your craving for a light snack. These would be great for making nachos!! You may want to try them out first, (one bag - if you can find them). I usually buy the 6 pack bags and they are usually sold out when I try to reorder on Amazon. I guess that is saying something.

I was throwing away lots of food before I found the Tender Favorites Variety of Meow Mix. She is able to lap it up because of the moi]sture content and sometimes I add a little chicken broth after she's left just the larger pieces and she's able to get more down. The cups are small, that's good in my case and there's not much waste, but it's rather expensive to buy in most stores. Since I've found it at Amazon, with free shipping, it's more resonably priced ! She's gained weight and is a much happier cat now. That's well worth a little more money![[ASIN:B000VJHCA6 Meow Mix Tender Favorites Poultry & Beef Variety Pack,  2.75-Ounce Cups (Pack of 48)]

review/summary: Like the flavor but came melted from amazon
review/text: I like the strawberry better then the vanilla yougurt bars. In fact the whole family seems to because I always find, boxes with all the strawberry eaten first! I won't buy these from amazon again in the summer months. The shipping is slow and in the bars sat on the delivery truck for over 15 hours in 100 degree heat so I got them melted. I had to put them in the freezer but they did not tatse the same.

review/summary: Great office snack
review/text: I stock our office on a regular basis (usually order off Amazon once a month) and these are uniformly a hit, month upon month.  They  taste great, they're good for a big boost of sugar, and I think they probably are somewhat healthy.  Although not sure at all of that, in the least.<br /><br />Get em.  They're pretty cheap too!

review/summary: LOW CAL SNACK THAT DELIVERS
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032GL19S">Nature Valley Chewy Yogurt Granola Bars, Variety Pack of Vanilla and Strawberry, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />Having to watch my calories has resulted in me always looking for foods that are low fat and delicious.  This combo is not easily available.  Having tried these yogurt bars which come in 2 flavors I have found a delicious low cal snack that delivers exactly what I want.  It is sweet, chewy and flavorful. You can also purchase these bars in either strawberry or vanilla rather then buying them together.  They are perfect alone or with a beverage.  If you have a sweet tooth and you are counting calories this granola bar is perfect, not too sweet, not sticky and not overwhelmingly chewy. They are perfect alone or with a beverage. They are even appealing to kids. I have given them to my grandsons who enjoy them as well. I will definitely re order this item and I am sure after you try them you will put them at the top of your shopping list.

review/summary: Tasty, and the yogurt coating is a nice addition
review/text: While I like yogurt out of a cup, I'm usually not fond of things that are dipped in yogurt. These are the exception - the yogurt coating on the bottom adds a very nice taste to the granola. Sweet, but not candy bar sweet. I prefer the strawberry over the vanilla, but both are good.<br /><br />The granola itself is soft but still holds together as a bar. The calorie count is decent (120 per bar). The nutritional content is not stellar, but reasonably good and much better than candy alternatives.<br /><br />Highly recommend, especially if you can get them on a price dip.

review/summary: A little too sweet
review/text: I wanted a bar for my breakfast before work but thought the special k bars might be too sweet.  THese are wayy sweeter.  14g per bar.  SO i guess for a daily meal it's probably pretty unhealthy.  But i dunno when i'm eating it I think i might as well be eating a candy bar or fresh doughnut because it's probably just as bad for me but tastes better (why i gave it 3 star).  I'll probably switch to something more healthy.  But i can't knock it down too much it taste good for what it is.. but its def not something i should have bought in bulk for my first purchase.

review/summary: I'll stick with Crunchy Nature Valley Bars
review/text: These bars are just two sweet for me and I prefer the crunchy over chewy bars.  I'm going to try and refrigerate the bars to harden up the yogurt coating.  This bar will definitely serve me more as a candy bar than a healthier snack bar.  They kind of taste like a fruity, tangy rice krispy bar to me.  Hopefully they'll grow on me 'cause we now own a pantry full. My guess is the kids won't be as particular and they like strawberry everything.  It was good value.  :-)

review/summary: Expires in less than 4 months
review/text: I received this item today bundled together in a way where I could not see the expiration date without cutting the plastic which bundled the 6 boxes together.  Mine expire 8/30 (today is 5/7).  I know that if I bought these in the store I would have at least a couple or more months of shelf life.  That said I should be able to get through them before the end of their shelf life and I would finish the rest even if they go over.  What is not cool is that the majority of groceries I have bought here are not nearly as fresh as those I would get a the store.  When I buy groceries here I expect them to be fresh, and considering Amazon's size I can't think of an excuse for getting products that have been sitting on a shelf for months.  I was unable to return (if I wanted to go to the trouble) these since they are not "not eligible for return."<br /><br />I gave these 2 stars for the actual product which is pretty good, but also sweet which needs to be considered if you are on a special diet.  I sometimes add them to my breakfast when I can't get something better.

review/text: Other supermarket brands just don't compare. These Guittard chocolate chips will bring out the best in your favorite recipe, that is if you can help eating them straight out of the bag. I use these in my cherry chocolate chip cookies and they add just the right "grown up" touch; the taste is dark without being bitter with just the right amount of sweet. Another favorite is a sprinkle of them on top of corn bread mini muffins, a treat I always enjoyed at a Canadian Pancake House while waiting for Sunday breakfast. Sweet!

review/text: I had so much fun with Wilton's green Color Mist for a green alien party! Remember, it's a MIST, which means it sprays LIGHTLY, so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods. For example, it's a great mist for popcorn. I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix, then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix. The kids loved it. You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows, white bread, potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors.<br /><br />I'll use the pink color mist for my next party: a pink pirate party, mateys!

review/summary: Tastes great, works great!
review/text: Pros:<br /><br />These energy shots really work! Some ingredients not listed in the description are Ginko Biloba and 5HTP, which  many experts say increase focus and energy. After drinking one of these, I noticed a significant focus and energy boost, and there was no crash like I have gotten with other energy drinks. The flavor is good, though obviously it's not going to taste like nectar since it has so many concentrated ingredients.<br /><br />BIG PRO: This has stevia as a sweetener -- no artificial stuff. I have always liked stevia and that is part of the reason I decided to try this one. Also, there are no artificial dies or flavors.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The only cons I have come from the packaging. The energy shot cap has a paper cover that just sits in there. If you drink part of an energy shot and then drink the rest later, you have to take the cap off and remove the soaked paper cover. This is really a minor issue so I decided not to knock off a star in my review.<br /><br />The shot is a little on the expensive side, but in my opinion, why buy cheap energy shots that have mediocre ingredients? It's just a few dollars higher than 5 hour energy, which did not work for me at all.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Since the ingredient list is not in the Amazon item description, here it is:<br /><br />EBOOST blend: Aloe vera leaf, vegetable glycerin, green tea leaf/caffeine complex (150ml caffeine), elderberry fruit extract, N-acetyl-L-tyrosine, glucoronolactone, blueberry juice concentrate, blackberry juice concentrate, blueberry puree, grape skin extract, maqui berry juice, Gingko biloba leaf extract, pomegranate concentrate, agave root, huperzine, mango fruit concentrate, quercetin dehydrate, acai fruit (Euterpe oleracea), grape seed extract, resveratrol, 5-HTP (from Griffonia simplicifolia seed extract).<br /><br />Other Ingredients: Purified water, natural flavors, citric acid, potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate and stevia leaf extract.

review/text: Being a very health conscious person, I thought I'd give Eboost products a try.  These taste horrible!  I'm at a loss for words to even describe it, but it's hard to swallow and kind of tastes like that bile substance you get in your mouth when you throw up in your mouth a little.<br /><br />I also tried the orange powder drink mix from Eboost and it was equally as bad.  I actually felt a little sick after I drank it.  I think the shot is a little worse though.  I don't believe the 5 star reviews that say it tastes great can possibly be real.  There is no way this tastes great, and is barely even tolerable in my opinion.  I don't believe it is an acquired taste either.<br /><br />I gave it two stars because it does have some vitamins in it, and it did give me a little boost of energy without that jittery caffeine feeling.  Once I stopped feeling nauseous from the taste, I actually felt pretty good.  It won't be enough to make me buy more though.

review/summary: Awesome energy shot!
review/text: I must say that I have tried different energy drinks and this one takes the cake.  I recently had to get off pain medications in the past 2 weeks after surgery.  I had awful withdrawal.  One of the symptoms was during the 2nd week, you experience depression and just feel exhausted.  This morning, I decided to try a sample someone sent me and I have been running ever since.  However, I think it tastes a little gross.  Almost a medicine taste.  But since it is all natural ingredients, I feel safe taking them.  So I'm getting ready to buy a supply of them.  I don't know how long they last but I hope it lasts all day.  Yesterday blew having to sit around feeling lousy.  Today is a good day just because of this energy shot.  Awesome! Thank you to whoever made these things.  xoxoxo :-)<br /><br />Kim
