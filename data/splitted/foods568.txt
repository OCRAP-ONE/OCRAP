review/summary: Good free-range broth.
review/text: This is my favorite soup base and couscous cooking liquid. I have found that it really adds great flavor my foods.<br /><br />I LOVE that it is made from free range chickens. The fact that it is organic is nice too.<br /><br />Sometimes it can be expensive, depending on where you get it from. I found this in my local grocery stores before I discovered it on Amazon.

review/text: These were a great price on Amazon with free shipping and no tax. I had to buy these before at a local store for almost $4/box. It makes a big difference in the taste when I cook rice with it. It's not too salty or strong flavor like some other brands. And it's labeled gluten-free.

review/text: I have loved Texas Pete for years now.  I had no idea they sold it like this, in little packets.  I will definitley being buying this soon.  If your like me, most food you eat when you out tastes bland.  Many restaurants when asked for hot sauce, plop down Franks Red Hot or Tabasco, no thanks.<br /><br />Number one it's unsanitary to use a hot sauce bottle some guy before has used, who knows how careful he was with it.  Knowing my luck the bottle touched his chewed up food, YUCK!!!<br /><br />Number two restaurants never have Texas Pete.  Well now apparently I CAN have it with me always, without the worry of a bottle leaking in my coat pocket.  Thank you world you have restored my confidence in you!!!

review/text: I love this product, it adds the right amount of everything to the food I eat.<br /><br /> As mentioned in the title, this product is called Texas Pete but was developed marketed and sold originally in NC. Just a little trivia for you Texas Pete lovers. It was later that it was sold world wide. It is still made on the NC family farm today where it all started. The marketer wanted to call it Mexican Joe but the inventors wanted a American name so he suggested Texas and the Pete was named after a young family member named Pete. Sorry to say it ain't from Texas. LOL

I was shocked that I had to paid whole $2 on organic and lousy $1 for "real lemon" in winni dixie store .<br /><br />I would reccomde that you stick with "real lemond" juice...it is only lemon. Still I would read to make sure.

review/text: Of the four different flavors of the Lipton beverage mixes that I've tried this one had the best flavor. It sounds weird to mix these 2 flavors but since neither one is actually what they tried for it didn't come out too bad. But, it still has the same problem that the other Lipton mixes have. It doesn't dissolve very well and no matter how much you shake it there's still some chunks in the bottom of the bottle.<br />  On the plus side, since I started trying the various powder single beverage mixes a couple of months ago, I've dropped a little over 25 pounds. Even though I did like the flavor of this one, for the price of it compared to the other brands available, I doubt that I will ever buy it again.

I do not care for this flavor as much as the Blueberry combination and am most annoyed that no one gave me any advance notice that my regular order was being changed.  Amazon, this is a glitch you need to fix!!  The seller should advise the buyer that they are no longer getting the product they wanted!<br />As for the merits of the drink:  it is okay but too strong on the Blackberry side.  Unless you really like the taste of blackberry that much you probably won't love this one.  I've cancelled this subscription!

review/summary: Fresh and Sweet, Delivers Zero Calories and Ten mg of Caffeine Per Serving
review/text: Lipton Green Tea to Go, energized blackberry/pomegranate offers a fresh-tasting delicate sweet tea that delivers zero calories and ten mg of caffeine per eight ounce fluid serving.  The Unilever product, the manufacturer states, is made from real tea leaves and contains 80 mg tea flavenoids per eight fluid ounce servings.  It is also sweetened with real fruit flavors, and is, as well, easy to prepare; just stir and enjoy.  The tea does take a little bit longer to dissolve than some other mixing powders, so you do have to shake, or stir well.  I find the caffeine helps as a pick-me-up when I get in hot and tired in the afternoon.<br /><br />I found the taste quite sweet and delicious.  What can I say, I just love the berries of summer, all of them, blueberries, and blackberries, raspberries, strawberries, stop me before I start raving...  I just, at a local farm stand, run by a local farmer with a good reputation, bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries and blackberries all at once, with only me to eat them.  And I did, don't worry about that.  Anyway, the pomegranate taste here does add a bit of tartness, and pomegranate is also considered quite healthy.  However, in the  list of ingredients I find Aspartame (Sweetener), Corn Syrup Solids, Modified Corn Starch,  Maltodextrin, and  Acesulfame Potassium as sweeteners: these ingredients concern me.  Of course, I'm not a dietitian, I just do my best to eat healthy stuff; this drink might, still, be more healthy than diet soda, I just don't know.

I have a much lower sugar intake now and I'm AWAKE!  I have been drinking this for months now..probably 6-8 months..and STILL love it!!  The flavor is mild, not overwhelming as I have found other energy mixes to be.  With two good solid shaking sessions of my water bottle, I have it fully mixed.  No powder left in the bottom.  This provides a mild berry flavor and the pick-me-up needed to get thru your day.  I would buy stock in this product if I could!!!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend it!<br /><br />- 1smileycat :-)

I am not a lover of sweetner aftertaste so I went through alot of flavors before finding one I really loved.  Lipton Green Tea Blackberry Pomegranate is by far my favorite. I drink one at work in the mornings and another around 3 in the afternoon with lots of water in between. It has a light refreshing flavor. This is actually the first product on Amazon.com that I subscribe to. Love, Love, Love it!

review/text: Lipton Green Tea To Go, Energize Blueberry Pomegranate<br /><br />It comes in little packets that you mix in a bottle of water (1 packet per 16.9 oz. bottle is considered 2 servings).<br />It dissolves easily in room temp water, but requires more vigorous shaking if water is really cold.<br />The taste is not bad and it helps you feel energized... well, each serving does contain 50mg of caffeine.<br />The cost per mixed bottle comes to less than 20 cents (if you do the subscribe and save).<br />You can add to that the cost of the water, but I just use the water cooler at work and re-use my bottle.<br />Even if you mix it with bottled water, the cost is still much less than a can of soda.<br /><br />Touted as a source of B vitamins, Ginseng, Guarana and Flavonoids.<br />Flavonoids are found naturally in plants and are generally thought to be healthy.<br />see [...]<br /><br />This product does use aspartame as a sweetener.  aspartame breaks down to Phenylalanine (an amino acid),<br />so those with an interlerance should avoid this.  Look it up on wiki if you're unsure.<br />Pregnant woman should probably seek advice from physician prior to consumption.<br /><br />I'd give it 5 stars if it didn't use aspartame.

review/summary: Refreshing, but not my fave
review/text: I really, really like the green tea-to-go flavor with honey & lemon,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EMD1MS">Lipton Green Tea To Go, Honey & Lemon, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a> and the Citrus one <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ODC3TY">Lipton Green Tea Iced Tea Mix To Go, Citrus, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>isn't bad either. This one comes in a distant third. As another reviewer mentioned, there's a slightly yucky flavor that does seem to be the Aspartame (which is weird, I never even notice it in diet coke). I didn't find it disgusting but I don't think I would order it again. It was refreshing though, and I did think the caffeine gave me a little boost

review/summary: doomed tea?
review/text: This shows signs of being a discontinued product. It has certainly disappeared from Oregon stores and I know our current isn't currently going out on a limb for consumer protection. I stockpiled enough to give me time to reformulate it or get close enough for jazz. Not using those disastrous little plastic bags for anything other than a road trip will be a serious improvement. Its cheaper too. Here the initial thought:<br /><br />search this on Amazon: Matcha Green Tea Powder<br />search on google: nature's flavors

review/text: It's a cheap energy boost. The taste isn't great but I can tolerate it for the quick, convenient energy supply.<br /><br />What's unfortunate is that when I first started drinking this it was Blueberry Pomegranate. One day, without warning, the Blueberry was gone to be replaced by Blackberry Pomegranate. I greatly preferred the blueberry flavor.

review/text: The tea taste great, not to sweet or tart and it does not have a chemical taste or after taste.  It provides me with energy I need for school, studying and gym at lower cost than vitamin water and fuze green tea which both taste great but have a disgusting after taste of chemical and sugar.  What I enjoy the most is I can drink several of them without getting a crash or stomach pains as I would when drinking coffee.

review/text: It tastes great to me. I love blueberries and pomegrantes so what's not to like. I only use a fourth of a packet per 8oz. glass of water. I rather drink this tea than the sugery cola I usually drink for an energy boost to do housework with arthritis. If you are expecting it to taste like juice, you will be disappointed. It is NOT meant to taste like juice. It taste like tea with a mild infusion of fruit.

I like it better than the raspberry/lime flavor.  But aspartame is very bad for you, and they should just label this stuff Lipton Powdered Rat Poison.

review/text: This mix is just awful.  No matter what, it will not fully dissolve.  Even after the most vigorous shake, I'll still see clumps at the bottom and big particles floating throughout the bottle.  To make matters worse, it has a sickening taste - literally!  I started to feel sick almost immediately after drinking a bit - the artificial flavoring is truly overwhelming.  And this is coming from someone who relies heavily on artificial sweeteners, so it's not like I'm new to these things.  Definitely not worth buying; I much prefer Crystal Light.

review/text: I tried to change food on him to a cheaper brand, but he refused so I decided to crack out the cash! However, I wanted to say that one thing that upset me when I got my order today (a few days early!YAY!) was that the bag is half empty.  I know it's by design but I think it could really save packaging and stuff if the food actually fit into the bag and not been twice the size of where the food ends.  I like that the food has good things for my dog and not crap.  I feed myself only organic food, why would I feed my service dog anything other than that too?

review/summary: The best food I've ever witnessed my dogs eat
review/text: We have an eight year old Pomeranian and an eight month old Papillon that refuse to not eat one another's food. Our dilemma was that we needed something easily digestible for our old-timer as well as a protein rich meal for our pup. We also caught wind of the dog food filler conspiracy and, reluctantly, switched from our supermarket bought, corn meal heavy brand to one of the higher quality names.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VIWOFM">Nature's Recipe Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Easy to Digest Chicken Rice and Barley Meal, 15 Pound Bag</a> was our first choice and it seemed to go well. Our Pom's bowels became a thing of regularity wonder and our Pap was growing big and strong...kind of. We began to notice some hotspots on our Pap and excessive scratching from both dogs. Our eyes were peeled for fleas and we treated the hotspots with topical ointment to no avail. I was making a return visit to the pet-meds section of our local pet superstore when I was cornered by a sales rep from Nutro. Before I could avoid him he had already asked me what dog food we currently used. I told him, and he immediately asked me if we were having any skin issues. I was sold before he told me what I needed to buy. He filled me in on the idea that the particular blend of Nature's Recipe that we were using lacked some essential nutrients key to healthy skin and coat.<br /><br />We have been using Nutro Ultra Small Breed for several weeks now and I could not be more pleased. Our Pom's insides are still working like a clock and, amazingly, our Pap's hotspots and itching spells have already been healed. I love this food...and I think my dogs like it too.<br /><br />Just one warning: when our older dog was eating the same quantity of Nutro as he was his previous foods, he began to put on weight fairly rapidly. In other words, one might want to monitor intake and the associated weight impact for a while and then adjust accordingly.

review/summary: My Shih Tzu loves this!
review/text: I recently changed his food from Nutro Max to Nutro Ultra and it made my life a lot easier. I had to hand feed his previous food to him because he doesn't care enough to do the hard work himself. I also had to give him Angel Eyes (which he hates) through his treats and not through his kibble. About a week ago I've been giving him Nutro Ultra and the much smaller size of his kibble makes it a lot easier for him to chew. I no longer have to hand feed him and I can give him his Angel Eyes through his kibble, so feeding him has become much less of a hassle.

If you are a fan of the "bunches" clusters in honey bunches of oats, this is the cereal for you. It is nice and crunchy and does not get soggy in milk very quickly. It is almost granola-like, but better in my opinion. 5 Stars!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: When I was a kid, Post used to make a cereal called C. W. Post. It was a granola type cereal that was the absolute best. It disappeared from the grocery shelves sometime in the 1980's.<br /><br />Fast forward to today. Walking down the grocery isle, I noticed the single row of just bunches, high on the grocer's shelf. Over the years, I had tried to find a granola cereal that could live up to the legend of the C.W. from my childhood. Sampling all that I could find, I had no luck equaling that wonderful crunchy taste.<br />Likely this new find, Just Bunches, would also disappoint, but I figured I should give it a try to see if it came at least close to what I remembered. It was from the Post people, perhaps they reached deep into their cereal recipe box and revived an old flavor from the past.... One could only hope.<br /><br />It the parking lot of the Grocery, I cracked open the box to give it a taste. Instantly I was transported back to my childhood, munching on cereal and watching Saturday morning cartoons, the road runner, bugs bunny, it all came back...<br /><br />I had found the 'holy Grail' of cereals.... ok, maybe that's taking it too far, but man its really good. So good, I subscribed for auto ship every month.

But now they are discontinued and its hard to find.<br />This product ships from Fernly NV and mine expires in 5 months.<br />The box looks so small it is the smallest Ive seen. Ive bought small boxes before, but these are smaller. I would say that its as small as my Ipad2. Only about two bowls per box. Put it in perspective a can of soda is 12oz, this box is 17oz. Really small!<br />I thought that it was a comparable deal to the supermarket (they were expensive at the market when available) but when you take in the size its a bit silly.<br />I was ready to order 20 boxes but via prudence waited to receive one order first. Thank goodness.<br />Too small. Must have been for a chain of hotels/timeshares to sell to patrons or something...

review/summary: My Starbucks Addition
review/text: I found out about this product in Starbucks. I add to my French Vanilla Tripio (three shots of SF Vanilla; three shots of SF Hazlenut; three shots of Expresso; add soy milk; Cooks Vanilla Powder, cinnamon and raw sugar) OMG!!! Delicious!!!. I googled the Cooks company after looking on the cannister. The Cooks company sells it, but Amazon was cheaper. A must buy. Give it a try if you love Vanilla as I.

review/summary: Not molasses
review/text: Note the Disclaimer: product may be different than pictured.  Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store doesn't know Barbados Molasses from old motor oil - and the label on the jar doesn't state what is in it. This goop is no different from Brer Rabbit sorghum (syrup) that you can buy in your local grocery store, other than it costs 3X as much through Amazon.  When I contacted Pa. Dutch Gen'l Store I was told they were just the distributor, so tough luck if I ended up with the wrong product.  Amazon is silent.  Lesson: DON'T TRY TO BUY "MOLASSES" FROM A BOOK STORE.  And DON'T BUY ANY PRODUCT FROM PA. DUTCH GEN'L STORE.  "GOLDEN BARREL" ISN'T THE "BARREL MOLASSES" YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  It's just a name on a label.  A PENNZOIL label would have been just as accurate.  The Disclaimer conveniently allows the vendor to display any picture, but ship anything from axle grease to dishwater.  Amazon needs to go back to selling books and stop trying to be Walmart.

review/summary: Love this stuff!
review/text: I found this stuff when I switched to glueten free diet, but after adding glueten back to my diet, I still eat this several times a week. Some of the reasons I love this: it doesn't  become completely mushy, has a nice texture. Not crunchy, though. The flavor is nice, but I add brown sugar and frozen blueberries and cook with half milk/half water (of course not frozen once I eat them). Another great thing about this cereal is that it cooks quickly, comparing to steel cut oats. If you're a hot cereal fan, you'll like this, if not...send it to me. I'm so excited amazon carries this with prime (finally!). I've been buying this in 25# bags direct from BRM, now I can buy smaller bulk!

review/summary: Lower sugar than most, packed with great flavor!
review/text: These bars are wonderful!  Full of nuts and the box says just 6 grams of sugar, much lower than others I have tried.  The protein really fills me up and keeps me sated for 2+ hours. I think they taste like Cracker Jack without the popcorn, very light and crunchy.<br /><br />Other nut bars I have tried are chewy and the nuts tend to lose their snap sitting in nougat-style binding; these are lightly sweet and brittle.  I break up the bar before I open the open the pouch and pop in the clusters while I work to keep me away from the donuts in the break room.<br /><br />The price is fantastic: the amazon.com 6 pack breaks down to 57 cents a bar, which is WAY less expensive than other nut bars of this quality.  I used to eat KIND bars, but they are over $1 a bar and more sugar.<br /><br />There are only 8 ingredients and I can pronounce and recognize them all; there is corn syrup in these, but it is not High Fructose Corn Syrup (which is modified and not very good for you).  I eat about 3-4 of these a week.<br /><br />Another tip: I am 6 months pregnant and find these a perfect thing to keep in my purse for when I need a nosh to keep me from getting light-headed, the protein and low sugar keeps me buoyant and doesn't send me crashing.  One of these, a string cheese and a piece of fresh fruit is a filling and easy mid-day meal when I am pressed for time.

review/summary: Such a tasty treat that your mouth will thank you!
review/text: I received a box of the Nature Valley Roasted Almond Crunch bars and a box of the Nature Valley Peanut Crunch bars to try and write a review on.  They are both delicious but I admit the Nature Valley Peanut Crunch bars is my favorite!  My husband preferred the Nature Valley Almond Crunch bars but he also likes almonds more than I do.  These bars were not at all what I initially expected.  They are almost like a brittle.  They are sweet and crunchy.  The Almond Crunch bars contain almonds, sunflower seeds and peanuts.  The Peanut Crunch contain peanuts, sunflower seeds and almond flour.<br /><br />I have always liked granola and protein bars because they are easy to take with you and give you a quick pick me.  Low and behold, I have found a replacement!  I'm definitely hooked on the Peanut Crunch bars and I keep one in my purse at all times.<br /><br />You owe it to yourself to try these tasty bars at least once.  You can't go wrong with either of these YUMMY crunch bars and you won't be disappointed!

A good way to lose a lot of nuts all over the front of your shirt every time you take a bite.<br /><br />The bar form adds nothing to me, except for corn syrup that I neither need nor want, and just makes it harder to consume. I would rather just eat the roasted nuts!

review/summary: Great Snacks for home or on the go
review/text: I first encountered these at a close out store, and was pleased to find them still in production. These Nut Bars are the answer to my Why is Granola So Sugary/starchy Question.  They are nuts not oats and grains, there is a bit of rice but not much, they have a hard head quaking CRUNCH that is so satisfying. Not crispy but crunchy, Not gooey, but chew inducing, jaw workout.<br /><br />I like the, got them for my Boyfriend and recommend them to my Mom and Dad.  Another bonus is because they are not grain based the carbohydrate count is reasonable, 13g of carbohydrates, 2g of fiber and 6g of sugar. That beats any so called healthy granola bar to the ground as far as sugars go.<br /><br />The only down side to my order, is that this order had 6 boxes and so far I've gone through 3 of them and they have all been broken up in the package. That doesn't affect the eat-a-bility of the bar since you are gonna crunch it apart anyway,  It would only matter if you were presenting the bar without the package and that's not typical except in fake photographing for advertisement. :p  They got eaten up just the same.  They are good with a glass of cold milk, or my favorite a glass of cold Plain Unsweetened almond milk. If you're gonna be nutty, why not go all the way!<br /><br />Edited August 21, 2012<br />Well, I'm a bit disappointed. I started buying these bars on subscribe and save at $14 per package of 6. In April of this year the price was $16/6, and I delayed buying more because i was having financial problems, but I just came back to add a early shipment to schedule and I see that the price has JUMPED TO $22 PER 6 BOXES. That's a $7 increase  in price in just 4 months! How do they justify this price HIKE!? Yeah it's a hike, cause it only increased $2 over two years now $7 in 4 months. What's going On!?  I won't take away any stars cause the product is still awesome and tasty, but I was paying $2.66 per box and the price is now $3.66 per box. That's a huge jump in price. I don't know...

review/text: So far these have become my favorite granola bar from Nature Valley or anywhere else. I just discovered them a few months ago, and since my supply was getting low, I went to Wally world today and bought them out except for one box that was way in the back and beyond my reach.  Sometimes I'll have one in the morning and don't feel hungry for hours. They are very crunchy, and take awhile to chew since I don't want to do any damage to my teeth, and also  have high fructose corn syrup~ wish it was honey instead, but I like them.

review/text: The nuts are good for you but what about the salt? From the taste of it, I think that this is pretty high on sodium 180mg/bar. I think thats pretty high considering that too much sodium is not good for you and we tend to have quite a bit of sodium in other stuff we eat. Tastes good. And if you are really hungry, you can eat one of this bars and it will make you feel full for 60-90mins.
