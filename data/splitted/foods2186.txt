review/summary: good tea
review/text: A most enjoyable, if somewhat faint, tea. My daughter just came back from China and she said it was the best tea she's had since China. Somewhat to the whie tea side (2 buds) of green tea (and a leaf), I prefer a greener tea that tastes more like spinach, but then again I am somewhat of a western peasant.

review/summary: Very nice, but not the tea in Japanese restaurants
review/text: This is a very nice green tea with great flavor, but the description makes it sound a bit like the REALLY green-colored tea found in sushi restaurants.  It is not - when brewed, it comes out a light brownish-green, similar (oddly) to the color of the cardboard box in the picture.  It also is not as "grassy" as that green tea - the flavor is definitely bolder.  Brew at about 180 for best results - if you brew in boiling water it can become bitter.  This is a great deal for green tea of this quality in this volume.  Each bag is individually sealed, which is nice although it does involve some waste of plastic.<br /><br />If you're trying to switch from coffee or black tea to green, it's hard to go wrong with this stuff.  If you are a lover of "flavored" teas you will probably not like this - it is JUST tea, no flavors, pure and very simple.  Also, for those who care, green tea can stain your teeth even more than coffee, strangely - be warned if you plan to drink a lot of this.  On the positive side, it won't give you that wretched coffee breath that is the bane of my office existence.

review/summary: Not Good Tea
review/text: While this is decent for mass produced bagged tea, the cost is not at all justified.  I've had my fair share of Japanese greens, including many Tamaryokuchas, and this is not a good Tamaryokucha.<br /><br />Not only is the aroma and flavor lacking (this almost tastes and smells like a bad vegetal oolong more than a Japanese green), the color is completely off.  Instead of the emerald green you'd expect from a steamed Japanese green, it produces a muddy yellow color.  The lush mango aftertaste you'd expect from a Tamaryokucha is almost completely missing from this tea.<br /><br />If you want a true Japanese tea experience, go to a local tea shop and buy some high-grade Tamaryokucha, Gyokuro, Sencha or Matcha and a cheap kyusu to brew it in.  The initial cost will be higher, but you will save money over the long run brewing in this method, and the quality of your tea will be considerably better.

review/summary: Hot Peppers Need Hot Weather
review/text: I bought these from Think Geek instead of Amazon, and they're amazing.  However, I've seen several reviews with low ratings claiming that they never grew, so I thought I'd add my review with a few tips and tricks to growing these mind-blowing peppers.<br /><br />1) Ghost Chili's require hot temperatures to grow in.  More specifically, these pepper seeds will not germinate in soil that is under around 75 degrees Fahrenheit.  This means you need to grow them starting in late spring or even early summer if you don't want to use artificial means, to make sure its hot enough for them to sprout.  If you want to grow them earlier or in the winter, you may need to heat the soil yourself.  A simple heating pad wrapped around the pot set on low is typically sufficient.  Ideally they like 75-95 degree temperatures.<br /><br />2) You can affect how hot the peppers will be based on how you care for them.  The more stressed the plant is, the hotter the peppers will be.  Make sure you plant and feed your peppers while growing, but once they start producing fruit, cutting back on their water from time to time will make them hotter.  Also, if you cut back on the fertilizer (Nitrogen, specifically) while they are fruiting, you'll get hotter peppers as well.  Humidity also affects heat.  The higher the humidity, the hotter the pepper (good news for people in the South!).  And finally, the air temperature when the chili's ripen affect how hot they are as well, hotter it is outside, the hotter the peppers will be on the inside!  If you keep them unstressed and in a dry climate, the peppers will end up being sweeter.  They'll still be the hottest thing you ever put in your mouth though, so if you're not used to stressing plants without actually hurting them, its better to be kind to them than try to maximize their heat.  Its not like your tongue will know the difference between 850k and 1 mil scovilles anyway.<br /><br />3) Ghost Chili's like neutral to slightly acidic soil.  A PH of 5-6 is ideal, but your standard 6.5 potting soil will be just fine.  If you're not experienced with mixing your own soil, don't try it (you'll just kill the plants), use whats in the can and get regular mix from Walmart when you're ready to transplant.<br /><br />4) Don't grow these in the can.  Not that there's anything wrong with the can per say, it is rather small (picture looks like its coke can sized, its not, its maybe half that size).  You'll need to transfer the peppers to something bigger sooner than later, and they'll be rather young when they start to outgrow the can.  Moving them at that age is stressful, better to avoid it altogether by just starting with a larger pot to begin with.<br /><br />Ghost Chili's can be a little particular when sprouting, but they grow very well once started and they provide you with a once in a lifetime experience (because you'll never be dumb enough to bite into one a second time!).  For $10, you can't go wrong with these things.  And on the up side, after slipping a few of these into your cooking, you'll never be pressured to bring a side dish to a dinner ever again! ;)

review/summary: 3 plants from one pot
review/text: I actually got this item as a gift and it's worked out great. I watered my can during the winter and kept it on south facing windowsill for a few months. The initial growth took about 6-8 weeks to show up for me. Eventually I had 13 sprouts show up, but most eventually died off and I was left with 3 pretty hardy plants. When the plant got to be about 4-5 inches tall, I repotted them and put them outside in direct sun once the weather got warmer. They grew quite well and as of this moment, one plant has about 7 ripe chiles on them while the other two are putting out green ones. They stay green for a long time it seems and then transition to red practically over night.<br /><br />I see quite a few negative reviews on this product and I'm pretty surprised since I've had GREAT results from mine. I'd imagine some if it might be user error (though we obviously never like admitting that) and some of it might be legitimate dud products. Results may vary of course.<br /><br />Also, since positive reviews amongst a sea of negatives are oftentimes greeted with a little skepticism, I've uploaded a few customer photos to show my results.

review/summary: Ghost chili in a can, great item
review/text: Please do not listen to the writers who had bad experiences. These seeds in cans are a good product, but additional information will help you to be successful. I have purchased a dozen of these cans and I have gotten plants from every can. You must be patient and keep the cans in a warm area of your house. I keep the can under a grow light and near a heat vent to keep it warm. The seeds do not need light to sprout but warmth helps a lot. Experts say ideal is for the dirt to be 80-90 degrees F. Germination can take 1-6 weeks so do not throw your cans away. Be patient! I have gotten 3-6 seedlings from every can. Water the seeds, then re-water when the top of the planting material is dry. The last can I bought I successfully got 4 plants started, and my current can just sprouted a plant after a week because I concentrated on keeping it warm.<br /><br />After the seedlings sprout let them grow for a time in the can. Water when the material they are growing in is dry on the surface. They hate too much water and will die quickly if over-watered. Wait until the seedlings have 4 leaves before transplanting. Dig deep when getting the seedling out of the can to transplant because the roots go straight down. Scoop down twice as deep as the plant is above the ground. They need to grow inside for 8-10 weeks before planting outside, and they take 160-180 days from planting to harvest. So calculating the time needed for germination and inside growth you need to start 12-16 weeks before you plan spring planting, then an additional 5-6 months for harvest. Total time can be 9-10 months start to finish. So if you plan to plant March 15th you need to start now. These chili peppers take a long time but are definitely worth it if you like hot chili peppers. Good luck, have fun.

review/text: I purchased this product for my husband.  Him and his friends had heard about the Ghost Chilli and had all wished to see who was the bigger man by eating one.  Anyway I read the reviews for this product and was a little sceptical, but bought it anyway thinking that it was about 50/50 chance something grew.<br /><br />I bought this product in February of this year and we live in Wyoming so it wasnt the warmist time of our year, but now in April we have several leafy sprots coming in.  I will say that my husband has been dilligent with the temperature.  He would check the soil with a therm. every so many days as well as checking the water level to make sure it had just enough water.  He placed it in the sunniest part of our house that gets direct sun light all day long.<br /><br />As for some of the comments that there were no instructions with their product.  Our's did.  It was a small portion of the cardboard wrap around packaging.  It tells you how to open the product, what kind of sunny light and soil temp. it needs, and how to water it.  We followed this little directions religiously and we are seeing things happin.

review/text: I was at first skeptical about purchasing these seeds. It seemed a little too unusual. I was not very familiar with the ghost chili peppers.<br />However after buying the product and using it I was surprised at how well the peppers grew. I got 3 very healthy plans out of these seeds with multiple very hot peppers! I transplanted 3 plants only because I had limited growing space and did not use all of the seedlings (next year I am expanding!).<br />With patients I was able to produce very hot peppers.<br />I am looking forward to purchasing the seeds again.<br />Would recommend that you find a sunny spot that is not 'cold' and not 'too hot'.  Water frequently but don't drown them either.  Also if you live as far north as I do, start early!!<br /><br />Be careful - they are hot.

review/text: Please don't let my title fool you....my plant grew perfectly and the color on my peppers are a bright orange. I'll get to why i'm disappointed later.<br /><br />1. As a previous reviewer wrote you have to plant these in late spring. Follow the instructions with the can and it will be fine.  I kept it in the can until it actually grew over 4 stems. Getting it out of the can witout destroying the root was not easy in anyway.<br /><br />2. Plant in a large pot. My plant was on my balcony with FULL SUN and i watered it everyday.  I used Mircale Grow Soil with food. As the plant continued to grow i added used EGG Shells to the soil. I continued to water it when the soil got dry as it got bigger. I wish i could add a picture of my peppers but i don't feel like adding a video review. The color is beautiful<br /><br />3. Full SUN all the time.<br /><br />4. Pull the plant back inside if the weather drops below 50.<br /><br />the reason why i am disappointed. It wasn't as intense as i thought it would be. I guess i built up the pain index thinking it was going to be insane heat requiring gallons of milk to be spread on my face. I thought of Homer Simpson and Guatemalan Insanity Pepper....but it didn't happen that way. I did eat it raw...don't know if that had anything to do with it.<br /><br />Plant rocks...don't be fooled. People may have gotten bad plants. I was scared when i first got it because i thought it was a dud. Give it time, water & sun (basic plant stuff) and it will grow painfully slow.

On our window sill in this mild spring and summer, the aluminum growing container helps give the pepper plant the warmest soil condition for optimal growth.

As long as these are true bhut jolokia plants, I am quite happy with the results.

review/text: Like other people have said, these peppers need hot weather and need time to germinate. Mine sprouted in about 2-3 weeks. When it was warm outside I used a 20oz plastic soda bottle with the bottom cut off to act as a makeshift greenhouse for the peppers. It fits perfectly around the small planter and keeps the seeds hot and humid, especially during the night. The average temp was 70s-80s during the day and 50s-60s at night. Then when we had a few cold days I just kept it inside around 70 degrees. After a couple of weeks I finally have two small sprouts appearing.<br />Just have patience people.

I hope it grows, but based on the reviews (...which I wish I had read before purchasing) the chance of this "plant" producing peppers is not so hot. (pun intended). Now I wish I had the drink in the can instead.  That would have been more useful.

review/text: I opened/planted the Bhut Jolokia plant at the beginning of the summer. I followed the instructions that it came with and here I am in the first week of September with no peppers. NOTHING grew, not even a little sprout of what could have been a pepper. It was a waste of time and money.

review/summary: Ghost chile in a can
review/text: Plant arrived very quickly. However I was expecting a plant, not seeds in a can. and got no instructions with it . I assumed you pull the pop top [or bottom], put the plastic cap over it and water. Anyway it worked. Seeds sprouted in a week, . Weather has been warm, with lotsa rain  in SW Florida which is maybe why mine grows and others don't.<br /> I emailed the company but have not heard how to transplant a metal can of vermiculite . When big enough I will pull all but one sprout, wait for peppers to ripen, and gather seeds for the next one to plant in soil.<br />I have to admit is is a novel idea

review/summary: Not for everyone.
review/text: While I did not buy this item online I did buy it at a local shop while out and about a few months back.  I see a lot of negative reviews about this product from people who claim to have followed the directions of just went ahead and immediately put the packet in a planter.  Peppers can be tricky to grow and with this particular setup (I've purchased the various other 'magic' plant's over the years and never had a bad one) you have to understand that these are NOT native to the america's so the growing conditions need to be taken into consideration.  It says on the package itself to rest the item in 50% sunlight (meaning to put it on a windowsill where you don't get much direct sunlight through.  My bedroom only receives direct light until about 10:00a.m.) and then when the plant has grown large enough to transfer it into direct sunlight.  My particular pack had 4 sprouts come out (higher than normal) and I transplanted them early and lost two of them to the sun.  The other two are growing fine in a planter where I eagerly await my ghost chili's to improve my hot sauce recipes.  If you REALLY follow the directions and know just a little about gardening this WILL grow for you.  If you look for the seeds you will not find them as pepper seeds can be VERY small and blend in well with planting material.

review/text: Yes, I read the product information but I decided to take a chance on a faster germination.  I used a 2" deep pan and put 1" of Miracle Grow potting soil in the bottom.  Then I mixed the ghost pepper plant potting mixture with 1/3 equal volume of Miracle Grow potting soil.  Put it in a warm place and got the sprout up in 7 days!<br /><br />It has only popped up through the soil for 2 days now but it looks healthy and is growing well.

review/summary: It really does work, and I have no experience.
review/text: I ordered this product on a whim because I am a fan of different hot sauces and hot peppers. I have ZERO experience growing plants. After reading some of the reviews on here, I was a little nervous, but for the price I didn't have much to lose. The current top comment does a great job of explaining why many people apparently had issues with this product. I'm growing mine at work in our server closet until it gets large enough to transplant and move outside. Some people said it took months for their seeds to sprout. I followed the directions and kept it in a warm place (on top of an electrical transformer in the server closet) with enough moisture. After only 3 1/2 weeks I have 4 small sprouts coming up. That's where it's at currently, but everything from here on is up to me. The product did what it was supposed to do. I look forward to seeing if I can keep these plants alive! :-)

review/summary: Cute idea, but toss the can!
review/text: I let these germinate and grow in the can. I had 5 ghost chili sprouts after about a month or so of germination (maybe more, like a month and a half). I thinned it down to 3, thinking 5 would be too much for the can. Then I took 1 seedling out and planted it in my garden - it's now 3' high but no peppers, just buds. The other two seedlings got to the point where watering them every 5 hours in the can wasn't enough. I put them in a garden box instead, and tossed the can. Seriously, toss the can from the start or just buy the seeds. The can MIGHT be able to support 1 plant - then, of course, you won't get peppers (or at least not good ones) without cross pollination. I have already had 1 marble-sized red pepper and I have 2 more quarter-diameter peppers on the plant yet to turn red from the 2 in the garden box. The marble-sized one was a mild ghost, compared to ones I've had in the past, but still much hotter than a habanero! If the peppers aren't germinating, make sure to keep the lid on the can and keep the can in a warm to hot area with lots of sun (75+ in the can) for at least two months before giving up. I grew ghosts from seed and they sprouted in 3 weeks, but these seeds in the can just took that much longer.

review/text: Revisited this review and just wanted to say you need this in a hot area.  Mine sprouted and I tried to move them from inside the house to outside and they wilted and died.  The product is fine and works but these peppers are very hard to grow.  I did get another to grow but need very high temps 85F and very little water.  To much kills them aswell as they will rot.  The peppers are hotter than most.  They are very edible but they are very different from most you may be used to.  For one they smell very smokey almost BO like.  Yet they taste fruity at first and a slow rolling mack truck sneaks up and hits ya.<br /><br />  The heat eating by itself is pretty intense.  Not like the morons on youtube but it will make ya sweat and if on an empty stomach it could make ya ill for a bit.  Other than that just a buyer beware that these are very hard to grow,

review/summary: it worked, it really worked
review/text: Can I just say that I was a bit skeptical that this would work. I saw some reviews from people who said it didn't come up but I decided to risk it. I needed a couple of coworker gifts for people who brag that there is no such a thing as too hot of a salsa. I thought it would be a funny gift and a cute little package. I got one for myself because I thought it was cool and pretended it was a gift from the dog.<br /><br />So I started it Christmas day. It was very simple. For a long time nothing came up. I looked it up and saw that it needs to be kept warm, and it does mean WARM. The house is around 65 at night so clearly that's too cold for it. I put it under a plant lamp and two days later I had seedlings.<br /><br />The only problem is that I sort of stirred the dirt around with my finger looking for signs of life. Thanks to that the plants are all coming up around the edges and they're so small I'm afraid to do anything about it right now.<br /><br />ps. I am SO not eating these if I actually get peppers.

review/summary: 5 stars since it grew
review/text: Bought this through thinkgeek.com  Followed directions, watered it fully and drained, sprinkled some water on day 8 cuz it seemed dry.  Then fully watered and drained again on day 12.  The thing is sitting on my desk at work where the temperature is climate controlled and stays about 75 year round.  I was worried it was too cold because they are supposed to germinate in 80 - 90 degree air.  There is zero sunlight in my office, just bright florescents that stay on about 14 hours a day.  Day 12 was a Friday, came in on Monday and there were 2 little sprouts!<br /><br />The internet tells me that it probably won't get huge and make tons of peppers unless it gets real sunlight, but we shall see.  Fun 4 bucks to spend.

review/text: I purchased this item on Amazon in May because I love eating super hot peppers, but the result has been a huge disappointment. For the cheap price it was maybe worth trying as an experiment...but never again. Not having a particularly green thumb, I should have listened to all the other negative reviews. I followed the instructions exactly and the seeds never sprouted at all. I read that this chili needs constantly warm temperatures, above 75 degrees F to grow. That may explain why I haven't seen anything yet. We had a cold, wet spring and a cooler than normal start to summer. If I try an experiment like this again, it will be with plants that have already sprouted.

After a month of trying to grow the plant I contacted the magic plant company. They sent me more seeds which looked like the flakes you put on pizza minus the seeds. I planted them anyway. Another month later...and still nothing. I wouldn't waste my time with this. Go on eBay and buy the whole live plant if you want to have a ghost chili plant.

review/summary: Training Treats from Healthy Dog Food
review/text: If you want a training treat that will have your dog eager to learn, try cutting these rolls into small chunks.  Given to dogs in small doses for good behavior, you will have them paying rapt attention to whatever you ask of them. And, because it's a balanced dog food you are not giving them an unhealthy snack.<br /><br /> I personally don't like highly nitrated "hot dog" pieces that many trainers recommend or many other commercial treats. Some I've tried that are "healthy" don't really excite my dog.  I am concerned about what my dog eats, fortunately, he is pretty fussy,- so if you are too, your dog will most likely love this healthy treat and you can feel good about giving it to your dog. My dog also loves the Duck/Potato combo.<br /><br />Keep some in a plastic bag in your pocket or pouch and reward your dog for their good behavior.

review/summary: over 90% germination rate
review/text: These are all medium sized seeds, between the size of radish and garbanzo, with a very high germination rate. I use the SproutMaster which makes growing sprouts a breeze. These are all mild flavored sprouts (unlike radish sprouts for example which have a bit of a radishy bite to them).<br /><br />If you don't know much about this kind of sprout, beans and peas are a good source of vegetarian protein. Sprouts, as they grow produce enzymes, which can play a number of roles in digestion and even immune system function, because most of your immune system is in your gestational tract. Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per-size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself.

review/summary: Great quality, great sprout rate.
review/text: I bought these sprouts for my parrot, along with the Victorio Kitchen Seed Sprouter.  To be honest, if you're just doing a small amount every few days, you can sprout these seeds without a sprouter.  They are great quality & very clean and there are very few seeds that don't sprout.  I've even started munching on them as I walk by the container each day, lol.<br /><br />The success rate with each batch is very surprising to me.  I expected a 50/50 sprout/spoil ratio, but it's well over 90% that sprout each time. A+++

So with my "experience" in the popcorn world I can truthfully say I will always come back to TBM Popcorn.  It's the most healthy popcorn out there on the market and it even taste better then every single microwave variety out there.  I have been eating TBM Popcorn for years, recently they have totally redesigned the bag the tiny popcorn comes in.. WOW!!! It looks classy, elegant, sophisticated AND it even gives you guide lines on how to prepare the product to its best results when popping -Not to mention a little history on the ancient heirloom popcorn.. Well done TBM Popcorn Well done! As an avid popcorn lover I cannot wait to see what your next big move is! Keep up the good work Farmer Gene!

review/text: I ordered a small bag of this to try out as we like popcorn occasionally.  Received it and followed the directions to pop it stovetop.  Lots of kernels left unpopped, but not an overly unacceptable amount.  Sprinkled some salt on it, and tried it.<br /><br />Not only ARE there hulls left on the popcorn, the popped amount is so small that all you can taste are the hulls!  Other reviews stated that this tasted sweeter than normal popcorn, and we have to disagree.  It tasted plain, and the hulls really bothered me.  Harder than normal popped corn, it was very disappointing.<br /><br />I'm very glad that I only ordered a small bag of this, as it will probably get thrown out.  Unacceptable to us and a waste of money.  Everyone's taste may vary, but we'll take normal-sized popcorn for our snacking needs.

I'm collecting dozens of cups of Decaf coffee that I do drink eventually (in the evening), but I am running out of caffeinated coffee cups already. The only option seems to be to pick one flavor and buy it, but do like to choose among a variety. Whoever comes up with a good ALL caffeinated sampler pack will have a dedicated customer.

review/summary: Good Variety
review/text: One of the advantages of the Keurig -K cup type brewers is the ease of trying different varieties of coffee cup by cup.  This variety pack arrived with 12 flavored coffee varieties, 12 "regular", 6 extra bold, 9 decaf and one Revv with Ginseng and Guarana.  There was one duplicate in our package- we had two Donut Shop coffee k cups.  That was the only duplicate.<br /><br />The packaging was not fancy but the coffee came well packed.  The k cups were in a 5x5x12 inch box which was packed inside a larger box for shipping.  All k cups were in good shape.  This was purchased in May 2012 and most k cups had expirations in November/December 2012 or January 2013.  One k cup was past it's best use by date by about a month.  There were 3 other k cups that had best use by dates that were within 2 weeks of purchase.<br /><br />All in all for getting close to 40 different varieties of coffee and compared to reviews for other sources of similar variety packs this was a good value for us. The vast majority of the k cups had best use by dates that were 6-8 months away with only 1 that was past date and only a couple that were short dates. I'd definitely purchase again in the future.

I was hoping for more than 2 decafs which is why I'm giving the seller a 3 star review. Also, the brown paper bag was a little tacky and some of the cups came with dents in them. I'm being forced to buy a 30 pack variety of decaf for the same price as the 40! I do wish they would specify at least that in the description.

review/text: I gave this a try and my very picky little dog loves this!!! and it does smell good - like a smoked smell,  I'm now out and "fifi" wants more - i used it as a treat mainly.  My dog did beg for this more than normal, now its like her breakfast sausage,  the only other treat my dog will eat is pupperonie and it seams from all the dancing around and begging she does for this stuff it must be good! seriously my dog won't even touch real fried bacon but we love this and will be ordering more soon.

review/summary: Galaxy Granola Raspberry--Great taste, Very low fat
review/text: I have been unable to purchase this cereal anywhere else, so the price is little higher than I would like, but I really like the cereal since I am on an Ornish low fat diet.  Where I live I can not buy this cereal in stores and can not order it thru health food stores.

review/summary: Best Granola Ever
review/text: It tastes great in milk or dry. The fat to flavor ratio is unbeatable. Galaxy has a couple of different flavors, but this is by far my favorite. Almond Vanilla Munch is second, though it is my wife's favorite. When I run low on the Raspberry sometimes I'll cut it with her Vanilla Almond until I can get to the store.

review/summary: One of the best choices in commercial cat foods
review/text: This food contains meat and the vitamins and minerals your cat needs - no fruits, vegetables or grains. It's ideal for cats who need a limited ingredient diet but whose owners are not willing to prepare a home made diet. All canned food contains thickeners such as guar gum or carrageenan which can also be allergens. However dry food contains a high level of starch (from grain or potato) to make it bake like a cereal, and starch is completely unsuitable for cats.<br /><br />I feed my own cats a home made raw meat diet, but I have fostered cats and I fed them Evo 95% meat. The rabbit and the chicken seem to be favorites.

review/summary: I T WORKS!
review/text: The EVO 95 has been the one thing that has stopped my cat from bleeding when he uses his litterbox...in other words, it stopped his colitis/internal allergies and he's been a healthy, active, loving cat since.  I couldn't get over the difference simply changing from a diet of hard/soft mix...which I was first on Royal Canin for him and then tried SD z/d...then went to this.  It worked...period.  To those bashing the company, quit the hysteria!  IT WORKS...and now both my cats are on it and doing well.  I lost two cats last year, and mine are doing well on this diet...and I'm thankful to have it!

review/text: My cats wouldn't touch any of the four flavors of EVO in this variety pack. They do eat canned Instinct from Nature's Variety.

review/summary: Works Great in Corn Bread
review/text: I purchased this corn flour so I could make the gluten-free corn bread recipe from the Babycakes Book.  It made delicious corn bread with a good consistency (not grainy).

review/summary: Bar-b-que!!!!
review/text: This bbq sauce is truly some of the best flavor blend of spices I have tried!!!!  Its smoky, sweet, tangy, just great!!!  Its hard to believe it has no sugar in it!  My 4 year old son dips his chicken nuggets in it!!!  We have the Ketchup also through Alterna sweets which is equally awesome!  A must try for sure!!
