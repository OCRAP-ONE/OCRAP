review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I bought these for my wife becuase she loves these pops, and although I don't have the sweet tooth she does, I have to agree that these are tastier than most I've tried. We were buying them from a local candy store, but they were expensive and they didn't always carry them in stock, so I bought this pack for her birthday, saving money and ending up with a nice reserve. She likes all the flavors, which is unusual because usually there is one or two flavors in a box of candies that she doesn't. Anyway, these are more expensive than most pops, but her happiness is worth it.

review/summary: Disappointed.
review/text: I purchased these to use at my daughter's wedding.  She is using daisies and I thought these would be great to make an adorable arrangement on the candy table.  I was VERY disappointed.  They are basically just small round lollipops.  The flower design is NOT obvious.  I am now placing an order for a different lollipop that I hope is actually shaped like a flower to use for my purpose. The picture is very misleading.  This is not what the lollipops look like at all.

review/text: I have been an amazon prime member for a few years, a celiac for 5 years and buy ALOT of stuff thru amazon but have never reviewed any of the items I have purchased, until now. I was hopeful when I saw these at a local store, but cautiously optimistic, as I have a small son with celiac too and love the idea he could know what a smore was. We were so excited, we opened the box in the car. My son loved them and couldnt understand why mommy was crying. THEY ARE THAT GOOD! I highly recommend them.

review/text: I was thrilled when I came across "S'MOREABLES" graham style crackers.They are great with butter and peanut butter. They make a great graham cracker crust. It is hard living without foods we once loved so even though these aren't perfect they are close enough to make me feel like I've come to my loving family. What more could I want?<br />  I love this product and I use it but I have one complaint,as with so many substitutes they have little food value.

review/text: YAY! These gluten free graham crackers are superb! They are thicker than the normal graham crackers that most people are used to but you quickly adapt. We like them just plain, out of the box but they also make great s'mores. For those of us that tend to be gluten sensitive it's wonderful to be able to enjoy graham crackers again! It's the little things in life that bring happiness! As we say in our house, "An open box is an empty box".

review/summary: Texture is grainy, but the taste is good!
review/text: The texture isn't exactly graham cracker, but it's not actually a terrible texture.  But the taste is pretty good!  I actually got that 'whoa hey this actually tastes like a real graham cracker!' sensation a few times.  It doesn't have a bad aftertaste, either.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pretty dang pleased with this alternative graham cracker.  I don't know how well it will work as a replacement in recipes - since the texture is significantly different - but it would certainly make a great replacement for s'mores or just regular every day snacks.<br /><br />(It's also apparently parrot-approved, to the point where if we are not careful, one of our birds will steal the cracker and fly off with it, and viciously fight to keep it.  He's not like that with everything.  Often, a shiny thing makes him drop a treat.  Noooot these.  Gotta hide 'em.  Not that it's terribly relevant to this review, but the image of a small green bird flying off with one of these crackers is hard to forget.)

review/summary: The best I've found
review/text: After searching and searching I found this product.  I am on a Gluten/wheat free diet and was missing lots of things including S'mores and cheese cake with a graham crust. I have always baked, even for our farmer's market so when I found I had to give up ALL my baked goods favorites, I was very depressed.  The first s'more I made in my toaster over with these crackers was heaven sent!!  I put one small square of milk choc and 1/2 a regular marshmallow on half of one cracker. I make four of these and put them in my toaster over at 300 degrees for about 3 mins till the marshmallow top (no top cracker)are a nice golden brown color. Pull them out and let them cool for about 2 mins-YUMMMM.  Also being a cheese cake lover, missed the crust on the bottom and I found that crushing these in a large freezer bag with a rolling pin make a decent crust for cheese cake and pies.  So if you have kids or are feeling deprived, these crackers really work great!  Why did I give them only 4 stars - these crackers are not as light and airy as the ones with wheat and do not have the exact taste for me as I have a better than average sense of taste and smell. But they work fine and I am sure for kids or with stuff on them and in baked goods they rate 5 stars.<br /><br />This price is way TOO HIGH.  My local gluten free place sells them for $4.99/box

review/text: I have used these for smores and they just don't work, they are to crumbly and have that grity taste that some gluten-free baking has.  I use Kinnikinnick brand for a lot of things and really wanted to like these but I just don't. These are fine for gramcraker crusts and I usually buy them to use for my cheese cake crust because when you put the butter with them to make the crust it helps with the gritiness.  However if you are looking for taste and a good thick graham craker that will work for smores, use the Jo-sefs brand...nothing compares.

review/text: I was introduced to this tea through my mother-in-law, a retired nurse/devotee who swears by its purported powers in aiding digestion (and settling stomachs).  While I can't say that I experienced any particular benefits in that area, I fell in love with its warm, spicy taste. If you like ginger, this tea is simple, singular, and delicious, a brew that begs the wind to howl and the snow to fall while you cozy up with it.  Add a little honey and you almost won't mind having a sore throat as an excuse to drink it.  It's strong if you steep as long as the manufacturer suggests, but that is up to you.  I love that it's ingredients are so pure, and though I'm not sure that it actually HEALS the body, it FEELS like it does, and that's half the fun.

review/text: I started drinking tea in the afternoon about a year ago and this is the first brand and type of tea I've really enjoyed. Interesting and flavorful tea without being overpowering. If you've never had Darjeeling give it a shot, best type of tea I've ever had and I've had a few. And, at least for me, the right amount of caffeine to give me a little kick in the afternoon, but not so much to wind me up. Excellent as a daily afternoon tea.

I stocked up on several bags. That being said, it isn't the worst food you could buy and for the price it was a good deal - nutrition and cost were equal.<br /><br />My 2 cats don't mind eating it. They do well on it. They didn't get sick or throw it up at all. They didn't lose or gain weight. There were no real indications of any changes at all. I would buy it again if it were on sale and heavily discounted, but I do typically choose a food that has actual meat as the first ingredient in the list and much less of the fillers.<br /><br />The cats seemed to like it, they didn't get sick, and they still seem healthy so I guess that's all that really matters.

review/text: I'm so happy to find a salt that is good for me, Celtic Sea Salt taste so much better than table salt and is actually healthy for you.<br /><br />"For humans to survive, salt is essential to regulate the water content in our body. Table salt, because it is refined, is unhealthy and toxic. But what our body really requires is natural pure salt.<br /><br />Hence the confusion in the minds of many. There are two forms of salt - bad salt and good salt. Eating table salt will actually deprive your body of the real salt and minerals that you need for healthy living."<br /><br />"Celtic Sea Salt is the moist salt that has been harvested from the Atlantic sea water off the coast of Brittany in France. It is harvested using the Celtic method of wooden rakes. No metal touches the salt. It is then naturally aired and sun-dried in clay ponds and gathered by wooden tools to preserve its living enzymes. Because of its unrefined nature it contains all of the 84 beneficial live elements found in the sea water. No chemicals and preservatives or additives are contained within Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Among the live minerals and trace elements found in Celtic sea salt are iodine, iron, calcium, magnesium, manganese, potassium and zinc.  The 84 trace minerals provide the necessary nutrients and protect the body from the harshness of sodium chloride that we consume from commercial salt. The appropriate magnesium content ensures that unused sodium is quickly and completely eliminated from the body through the kidneys to prevent harm."

review/summary: Celtic Salt
review/text: I have been researching salt for some time, and was amazed by the health benefits of Celtic Sea Salt.<br /><br />Not only is it good for you (in small doses) your body needs this type of salt compared to the table salt we are use to that is processed, and has more chemicals added to it. Table Salt is a side product of most salt companies it is mainly shipped to processors like Kellogs etc. so they can add it to their boxed products.<br /><br />Celtic Sea Salt is harvested off of the coast of france and naturally dried by the sun, and the sun gives the salt "energy". Yes it sounds strange, but this energy is beneficial to our bodies. Energy charged minerals go directly to where they are needed in our bodies. This salt is actually "guiltless salt".<br /><br />The taste is like any other salt or sea salt.

review/summary: The best flavor
review/text: The blend of flavor is fantastic for this olive oil seasoning for bread dipping.  I also add this to pita bread with a bit of olive oil and put in the toaster over for a great treat and also mix with olive oil, parsley flakes and a bit of S&P and toss this with boiled potatoes for a great side dish.<br />The only downside is that it's a bit pricey but so flavorful that a little goes a long way. They do not ship to Puerto Rico so I did have to ship it to a friend who then sent it to me thus adding additional costs.

review/summary: Best candy, ever
review/text: Our family and friends are hooked on this candy. It's been described as a cross between gum and starbursts. The flavors are great. The only thing to contend with is the substitution of flavors  without warning. Lemon is hard to find and to have it advertised as available was deceptive. Our pack was missing orange and lemon and were substituted with grape and melon. Two of our other favorite flavors. Disappointed but not worth returning the lot. I will, however, not purchase from this seller as we can get the other flavors locally for cheaper.

review/text: This is what Starbursts wish they were! And I love that I can order a multi pack rather than 10 packs of just one flavor. BUT a word of warning that you may get different flavors from the ones pictured above! We love every flavor so that's not a big deal for some, but others that have their hearts set on a certain flavor combination should stay away. Ours had Grape and Melon rather than Orange and Lemon.

review/text: If you have a "sweet spot" for sweets and/or less than an iron will-then DON'T buy these.  That's right, put the mouse down and walk away now!  Why, you may ask?  Because these tasty morsels are the equivalent of fruity, chewy, delicious crack. (Imagine Starburst without the artificial colors and flavors and a greater variety of flavors.) They are so wonderfully addictive that the package should contain a warning like-"MAY BE DETRIMENTAL TO DIETING AND LETHAL TO DIABETICS".<br /><br />Now, chocolate has always been my "drug" of choice.  At least until I tried these tasty tidbits!  Now if I was stranded on a desert island and given a choice between a lifetime supply of chocolate or a lifetime supply of Hi-chew assorted fruit chews, the fruit chews would win hands down.<br /><br />Gee, do you think these count as a serving of fruit?  Who am I fooling, I'm going to eat them anyway!

review/summary: Great Candy
review/text: Hi-Chew, hands down has to be one of the best candies that you may ever try. It's a real shame that it isn't marketed aggressively here in the States. Personally I think that they could become a major player in the market here since the only real competition is Starbursts which lets face it, has no flavor that really comples you.<br /><br />Anyway, I originally got introduced to Morinaga Hi-Chew at my local World Market, when I was looking for a quick candy fix to go along with my Ramune soda and discovered these little guys. But at almost 2 dollars for these and 4 for the bags, I was severely limited I purchasing because let's face it 2+ for some candy is a bit steep. So I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at a competitive rate. All in all, if you haven't tried this product then your missing out on something great.

review/text: We love this candy! We love the texture, it's like edible gum.  We love the different flavors.. my favorite is grape, 2nd favorite is melon (canteloupe); my husband's favorite is mango; my daughter loves all of them.  Flavors we got were the ones in description: 2 packs each of Strawberry, grape, Green Apple, melon, and Mango.  If you have a favorite you can order packs of 10 or 20 of only one flavor here on amazon, price depends on the flavor I think..<br /><br />At our local Asian/international market, there are only a few Hi-chew flavors, and sometimes they don't even have them at all.  They did have banana which I didn't like so much.  Plus I guess they were old cuz they were super hard!<br /><br />So I'm happy with this amazon purchase and would repurchase this. This pack costs $11, comes out to $1.10 each.. even if the price fluctuated it's still worth it for me to order amazon... takes us an hour to get to the Asian store and half hour to get to World Market.. gas plus tax.. then they might not have any!

review/text: I love Hi-Chews, it's like a higher version of starburst. This combo pack comes with 2 each, 5 different flavors. Mango, Strawberry, Grape, Apple, & Melon. These are the flavors put in order of best tasting to worst. The melon is absolutely disgusting. After trying it, I traded the unopened one in at my local convenience store for the strawberry flavor. HAHA. And, the apple has a chemical taste to it. I like to eat them by cutting the strawberry, mango, and grape pieces into thirds, and reconnecting them for a trifecta of the three best flavors, tastes AAAH-Mazing. The Mango tastes amazing, so does the strawberry, both mouth watering. and the grape is very, very good as well. the other two, Not so much, but I don't have to deal with them anymore. :)

review/text: I've been a fan of the "Hi-Chew" candies for quite some time and was glad to find this variety pack on Amazon.com! I especially like the chewy consistency (chewier than a Starburst, sort of a more dense consistency and that's a good thing) and the burst of flavor in each one. My favorites are the strawberry and green apple, though the mango is also good. The melon flavor is a little strange, my roommate described it as eating perfume, and I think that makes more sense than anything else. Overall, a yummy candy treat!

review/text: HI-CHEW is my personal all time favorite candy.  It's all about the texture.  It's almost like a cross between a starburst and a gummy bear.  Soft and chewy, but not like stick to your teeth chewy.  And the flavors are awesome.  They taste more like real fruit flavors instead of being over the top sweet with and imitation fruit flavor.  I've loved this candy ever since a friend went to Japan and brought some back.  And I would buy it every time I got lucky and stumbled upon it in a random liquor store or japan town.  I'm just so glad I can find it on amazon now and buy it in bulk whenever I want!  :)

review/summary: Love them, but there is something different....
review/text: When I found out that these were the American version of my favorite Chinese candy, I was ecstatic to buy them and try them out. With a nice assorted pack, this box has all the flavors that I was looking for, but I would have to say in decreasing order my favorite would go: Strawberry>Green Apple>Mango>Grape>Melon. However all of them are great. For some reason, when I have the Chinese version, they always seem to taste better, however, this just might be in my head and I could be crazy. Nonetheless, these are by far my favorite candy. I always tell my friends when they asks me about them that they are a "healthy starburst" which at 210 calories a pack they are. With real fruit and a taste so real, I would recommend these candies to anyone who wants a little sugar without all the calories and sugar of Starburst! You wont be let down.<br />I hope this helps:)<br />Note: Here is the Chinese Version : Morinaga - Japanese Hi-Chew Strawberry Candy -- Choice of 1 Pack or 12 Packs<br />But they seem a little expensive

That comes out to about $1.50 per pack. If you visit any Asian market, Hi Chew costs at most $1.<br /><br />Not only am I overpaying for candy, but I'm overpaying while buying in bulk which should NEVER happen.

It's all a matter of opinion, and all of these Green Mountain flavored coffees are mild with artificial flavors. It boils down to, would you rather have a blueberry muffin or french toast drenched with maple syrup with your coffee? Try 'em all, and pick your favorite is my suggestion. Also, check out the other flavors to see which is lower priced and take turns.

review/text: This has a natural flavor to it, not artificial at all, and some of the K-cups do have a serious artificial note (as does almost every flavored coffee seller). This tastes great when it's accompanying any hot blueberry breakfast- pancakes or waffles with blueberries would be nice served with this coffee, too. It's definitely a milder coffee, but it still tastes like coffee. I drink it w/ a couple teaspoons of raw sugar & a couple teaspoons of Coffeemate, and enjoy it even served alone. Not my everyday coffee, but since I love blueberry muffins, it's one I like to keep on hand. If you like flavored coffee, coffee in general & blueberries, I think you'd enjoy this.

review/text: I was doubtful about blueberry coffee but since this flavor had such great reviews on Keurig.com, I thought I'd give it a try.  As so many other people have said, I'm glad I did!  I was afraid it would be too strong but it's a perfect blend of coffee with a blueberry aftertaste!  I have started to enjoy many of the flavored K-cups but usually in the afternoon since I like plain strong coffee in the morning- but this one goes perfectly with my yogurt and fruit!  Enjoy!

review/summary: Pleasant taste...
review/text: Just FYI - This is a light roast coffee and has a pleasant taste to it. It is perfect for a relaxing morning as it does not caffeinate your bloodstream into overdrive but just keeps you mellow and for the afternoon cup of coffee this blend would serve well also.<br /><br />There is a subtle hint of blueberry flavoring - not too overwhelming. If you have it straight up you will enjoy it without any bitter taste. You do find the flavors of the coffee to be there. But then again every one has different taste buds and what I found to be enjoyable, you may find to be a unfavorable taste; but I don't think so. I know you will enjoy this light roasted coffee as it will bring a relative calmness over your soul.<br /><br />If you add a bit of cream (my choice is french vanilla cream), it will prove as a more satisfying taste. Overall a nice cup of coffee.

review/text: I figured that blueberry would be a nice change from the "normal" flavored coffees...well, it MIGHT be, but not from the k-cup I used.<br />The smell was fine. While brewing, I thought how good it smelled, and that it might just be a nice addition to the collection of k-cups I've currently got. I took a sip, though, and found the taste to seriously be lacking. IIt had flavor, but the flavor, to me, was very artificial. Like my experience with the gingerbread flavor, this one reminded me of an air freshener or potpourri.<br />I won't buy another box of this one...

review/text: I haven't had my Keurig for long and thought this coffee sounded wonderful! It smells fantastic when it's brewing as many have mentioned. This box came the evening before I was to take off on a long car trip. Early in the morning before my departure I brewed a cup of this and took off. A few miles from the house I took my first sip and about threw the mug out the window. The aftertaste is not pleasant, it's syrupy and awful. You need a chaser to drink this coffee. Be prepared or just don't buy it in the first place! There are so many good kinds of coffee for the Keurig don't waste time on this one.

I highly recommend this coffee and it is definitely one of my all time favorite coffee flavors. However, since it is a milder brew, I wouldn't recommend it being brewed in the largest size.  Enjoy!

review/text: I recently treated myself to a keurig single serve machine <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig B-70 B70 Platinum Single-Cup Home Brewing System</a> and was anxious to experiment with different coffees.  I am not a fan of strong coffee so I use the travel mug size to make this blueberry coffee.  This green mountain blueberry coffee is THE best coffee ever for someone who loves the treat of a light flavored coffee and the aroma is to die for.  I am not a coffee purist and do not claim to be an expert; however I do know the difference between a good and bad cup of Joe and this gets my vote for great flavored coffee.  Please try to buy fair trade coffee - take a few minutes to read up on the subject, it is worth it!

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: I logged in to write a review for this coffee and was shocked to see how positive the reviews were, I guess my taste is not in line with the norm. I got this coffee in a sample pack and it is the only flavor that has yet to be completely used. I made one cup and it smells fantastic, it was very strange to have a fruity smell come from a cup of coffee but it really smelled great, so much so that even after I decided I didn't like it I left it on my desk for a while just for the aroma. First I tried it black, thinking it may be sweet already but it is not and it was a weird sensation to taste blueberry with the normal bitterness of coffee. Then I added sweetener which made it better, the sweetness aligned with the taste and smell of blueberry. Ultimately I just didn't like it and didn't even finish the cup. I don't think fruit flavored coffee is for me.

review/summary: You won't believe how much you like it
review/text: I got some of these cups in a sampler pack and was like, "Meh, I can use them for company."  I never have liked blueberry flavored anything (except donuts because my God I'm only human), and am not that big into fruit-flavored coffee.  So these cups sat around my house for a while.  But wow - when I finally gave these a chance, I was hooked.  The aroma is absolutely heavenly.  And the flavor is the perfect hint of blueberry, it doesn't clash with the coffee like you think it would.  Because "on paper", who would put blueberry flavor and coffee flavor together?  It is not supposed to work but magically it does.<br /><br />There's something that happens psychologically too - you feel like you've eaten a blueberry donut after you've drank the coffee.  It's satisfying like you've really indulged for breakfast but without the calories of a muffin or pastry.  (I drink it with Equal and plain or vanilla creamer.)<br /><br />I served it to my parents over Christmas - real "black coffee only" folks - and they raved over it and for the first time ever asked for a second cup.  I've been disappointed in some Green Mountain flavors, but not this one.

review/text: This Blueberry coffee is AWESOME and Tastes Great in the beginning; but husband and I found that after having it so much, you begin to feel like you're just trying to get rid of it after a while. I think if we laid off of drinking it so much in the beginning, we might appreciate it more after all this time. hehe. If you haven't tried it, I do highly recommend that you do try it; just don't "overserve" yourself and get tired of it, like we did. We're going to back off and then drink some more in a few months. hehe. With that said.... the Only flavor that we have never gotten tired of is the Green Mountain Island Coconut!!! We have had the coconut just as long as the blueberry and had even more of it than the blueberry; but THAT COCONUT is the best one, by far, and I can't see us ever getting tired of it! SUPER HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ISLAND COCONUT!!!

review/summary: Smells one way, tastes another, but thankfully both are pretty good!
review/text: My boyfriend really wanted to try this blend as he has always enjoyed blueberry flavored coffees in the past.  We picked up one of the sample packs of this blend from keurig's website to give it a try.  I was skeptical about how a berry flavored coffee would translate when being brewed in the Keurig.  Fortunately, though, the end result is very good, although not at all like either of us expected.<br /><br />From the moment this coffee begins brewing, the blueberry scent is unmistakeable.  Very nice, but that had me worried that this coffee would have some sort of artificial sweetness to it.  Thankfully, however, that isn't the case.  While the scent may overpower you with the fragrance of fresh blueberries, the taste is a whole different thing altogether.  The taste of this coffee is incredibly woodsy with a bit of a hint of cinnamon (very subtle in the latter).  It's quite pleasing although totally unexpected.<br /><br />All in all my boyfriend even prefers this to the coffee shop blends, which speaks volumes in my book.  I think it's great and I'm sure we'll restock it when our current supply of pods runs out.

While of course it didn't  taste totally of blueberries, I was definitely not disappointed!  First cup I brewed, my kitchen smelled so good!!  Couldn't wait to taste it!<br />I am one who normally likes "a little coffee with my creamer".  Not with this coffee.  The blueberry taste is not overpowering but I find that I don't need to use as much creamer as with other coffees.<br />Bottom line,if you like the taste of blueberry in your coffee, you'll love it.  And have never totally disliked any Green Mountain coffee.  To me it's a a good coffee at a reasonable price.  And blueberry is THE BEST!!
