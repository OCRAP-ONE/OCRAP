review/summary: Sugar Free Jelly Belly Beans
review/text: These sugar free jelly beans are not a successful substitute for diabetics to use.  They are individually wrapped and very difficult to unwrap.I was so frustrated by trying to unwrap that I threw them away.  The taste is not superior to the sugar frees available at retail stores and sugnificantly more expensive, not including shipping charges.  I believe that the one pound weight advertised included the advertisment, making the net weight less that a pound.

review/summary: Too little for too much !
review/text: I ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy.  There is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound.<br /><br />Each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good.  You are probably used to Jelly Bellies, but these are not Jelly Bellies.  There flavor is medium at best.  I would not buy this product again.

review/text: I've used dried mushrooms many times over the years and these are among the best.  Though expensive the morel has great flavor and is easily reconstituted.  Already I've used them in a mushroom risotto and my favorite Fettuccine Alfredo.  The 4-ounce package has a volume of about five cups of the dried morels so it easily beats what I find in the local supermarket.

review/summary: Tasted GREAT!
review/text: These mushrooms were easy to reconstitute and, when used as a component in another recipe, they add an excellent flavor and texture.  Before I purchased them, I noticed that one reviewer said that these mushrooms didn't have any flavor, which caused me a little anxiety about ordering them.  I believe I know why he/she might believe that is the case.  The mushrooms themselves don't have huge amounts of flavor when you pull them out of the soaking liquid.  When you reconstitute them, be certain to keep the soaking liquid.  DON'T DISCARD IT because that's where most of the flavor is.  I suspect that might have been what happened in the other reviewer's case.<br /><br />You can strain the liquid or run it through a coffee filter to remove grit.  Then reduce the soaking liquid to add back into sauces or other morel recipes and the flavor can actually become more intense with the reconstituted mushrooms.<br /><br />All in all I'm very satisfied with this purchase, even though they are very expensive.

review/text: As someone on a limited budget, it's often difficult to find high quality green tea at a reasonable price. Brands like Ito En offer high quality, pre-brewed 'iced-tea' style drinks, but these can be quite pricey. Brands like Bigelow offer low-priced tea bags, but the quality is just not there. I find that the Yamamotoyama brand offers the best of both worlds: high quality bagged tea at a reasonable cost. While it's still bagged tea (and the hardcore tea enthusiasts might take issue with that), it is still some of the best bagged tea you will find, and you will be hard-pressed to find something equivalent in terms of price, quality, and convenience. Highly recommended.

review/summary: Find Your Happy Place
review/text: Disclaimer: I am not in any way associated with any brand of green tea manufacturer or seller.<br /><br />The following is a list of bagged green tea I have tried followed by my rating from 1.0 to 5.0 (5.0 being best):<br /><br />Salada =  1.0 (Probably the worst green tea I have ever had, extremely bitter, low quality green tea, lacking potency, I do not recommend)<br />Bigelow = 1.5 (Several varieties available at most grocery stores, overpriced, lacking quality, lacking flavor, lacking potency, just plain lacking)<br />Celestial Seasonings = 2.5 (Several varieties available at most grocery stores, overpriced, low quality green tea with pleasant side flavors, lacking potency)<br />Bentley's = 3.0 (Really hard to find, usually overpriced, medium quality green tea, slightly bitter overpowering the side flavors, would be a 4.0 but it is not 100% natural)<br />Yogi = 3.5 (Several varieties available, pricey, medium quality green tea with noticeably pleasant side flavors)<br />Tazo = 4.0 (Kind of hard to find locally, pricey, medium quality green tea with extremely pleasant side flavors)<br />Healing Teas of the World = 4.0 (Hard to find locally, fair price, 100% natural, high quality pure green tea with strong but pleasant side flavors)<br />Kirkland = 4.5 (Available at Costco, great price, 100% natural, high quality pure green tea, best tasting earthy flavor with tiny hint of sweetness, slightly lacking in potency or I would give a 5.0)<br />Yamamotoyama = 5.0 (Hard to find locally, great price, 100% natural, high quality pure green tea, quite delicious earthy flavor, extremely potent and effective)<br /><br />Conclusion: If you know what green tea is supposed to taste like and the effect it is supposed to have on the body and mind (potency), then you probably shouldn't waste your money on anything I have rated lower than a 4.5. If you are looking for a more herbal-style tea flavor, then go with something I have rated in the range of 2.0 to 4.0 and you will most likely be pleased. I hope this helps you find what you are looking for... :)

I drink this as well as their genmaicha.<br /><br />While I'd rather the teabags came in a box, the bag packaging is convenient because there are 9 packets of half a dozen or so teabags, which are convenient for throwing in a purse or suitcase.

While looking at snacks, I looked at the various trail mix offerings.  Small bags ... big prices.<br /><br />Then a huge bag caught my eye on the bottom shelf.  Deerfield?  Who are they?  Well, the price was right ... $5.<br /><br />Took the bag back to the condo and opened it up to try it.<br /><br />WOW.  What a GREAT mix of peanuts, raisins, dates, soy nuts & sunflower kernels!  Not very salty, not very sweet!  I couldn't put the bag down!  When I found I was sleeping while watching TV, I finally sealed the zip bag top.<br /><br />I enjoyed it for only a couple of days, then, I got another bag.<br /><br />The mix is superb!  Dates?  Great!  Soy nuts give it guts!<br /><br />I am looking into if our local Walgreens carries it.  I might just purchase it off the web!

review/summary: Better than Tijuana Mamas
review/text: Like other reviewers, I loves me some Tijuana Mamas. But I just recently discovered these, and I like them even better.<br /><br />The ingredients are similar, but these are beefier and, I think, just a tad hotter. (I'm reviewing Screamin' Demons here. Hot Heads are almost as hot, but not as fat as Demons.)<br /><br />They're made of a soft more-or-less-meatlike substance rather than proper sausage, but if you've had Tijuana Mamas before, you'll know what to expect. These are a bit harder than TMs but with a similar texture.<br /><br />Great snack -- and if you like spicy flavors the way I do, you'll also have a good time sucking out the leftover hot vinegar after eating the sausage.<br /><br />Nutritious? Hell, you've got your pork hearts, your vinegar, your pepper extract -- that's three of the basic food groups right there. The only one missing is alcohol, and I understand it's possible to get that from supplements. ;-)

review/summary: It's not hard sausage -- more like a mushy hot dog with red food coloring added
review/text: I've been a fan of Jack Links beef jerky for a long time.  This product, however, sorta scares me now that I've tried it.  They are dyed red and don't have a sausage-like consistency at all.  That is, this isn't a hard sausage.  It's like highly processed meat (including pork hearts!).  Under the red skin, they're really mushy, almost like p�t&eacute; or a soft hot dog.  An individually wrapped red, soft hot dog steeped in a vinegar-based hot sauce.<br /><br />The heat and tang are good, but the consistency is a bit too soft for me.  I'd love them if they were a bit less mushy and didn't mention the organ meat on the label.  Make sure to try one before buying in bulk.<br /><br />I'm not condemning the product or people who like it.  It just wasn't what I expected.  Your mileage may vary.

review/summary: Hurts So Good!
review/text: OMG these things are HOT and not for the faint of tongue! And that's from someone who is no wimp when it comes to spicy. But I love them. If I rinse the "juice" off under running water for about 20 seconds and make sure I have a drink (or fire extinguisher) at hand, they are really good. And unlike the delicious but addictive beef sticks, one is enough.<br /><br />The Jack Links Hot Heads are good too, and not as hot as these things, but the taste and texture aren't quite up to the Demons. If you can handle the heat, you'll probably like these. I would give them a 5 if they weren't quite so hot. But then I'm eating one as I write this, so maybe I'm especially sensitive right this minute. :)

review/text: this is a piece of processed sausage soaked in a delicious hot vinegar juice. It's really more of a processed pasty meat-like substance wrapped in casing than anything else.

review/summary: Hot Heads make a Comeback!
review/text: A few years back Jack Link Hot Heads were my favorite hot sausages. Somehow, as at least one reviewer shares, they developed a texture issue. The once firm, hot-dog like texure was replaced with a pate-like tube...which I did not care for.<br />Well, I recently decided to give them another try. Lo and behold! They're back to the orginal firmness! And still very tasty too!<br />Highly recommended!

review/summary: Awesome snack!!!
review/text: I have always liked these things (Screamin' Demon), and usually grab one on my way out of town to the beach.  But now that I'm pregnant and craving spicy stuff, I can't get enough of them!!!  The sodium content is high, so I have to watch it.  But the vinegar settles an icky tummy (believe it or not!), and the hotness has me going about cross-eyed...which is good for me because I like spicy stuff.  It really hurts tho if you get any of the juice under your tongue...that's tender meat under there!  However, if you're prone to heartburn, like I am, you'll be suffering a few hours later...have the Tums ready!  Overall, completely worth the suffering after eating it!

review/summary: Great way to feed your Jack Links Addiction
review/text: I buy these from local gas stations all the time. I grew up getting "tiajuana mama's" and Ficher's "red hots" from local stores. Jack Links has produced a similar product that I find tastier than anything else I have tried. If you like pickeled food with a vinegar taste (eggs, kosher pickles, sausage or most anything you would find in an interstate truckstop) you wont be disappointed with these.

review/text: After reading the reviews from others about how spicy this is, it's not THAT spicy. I eat breakfast that can be spicier at times. Also, it's too sour, too much vinegar. However, it's pretty good and it's only 150 calories, but 55% of daily salt. It will help if you are hungry, but not very convenient for on the go snacking since it drips when you open it.

You certainly do not need to be any kind of cheese expert to be able to enjoy a very satisfying cheese that doesnt taste ANYTHING like those tiny round wheels at most grocery stores.

If you are sensitive to gluten and on a gluten free diet this may not be the product for you.

This year I finally found these online and ordered four packages.  Wow, even better than the Brach brand.  Packed with flavor and filling, these are excellent candies.  A bit on the pricey side for candy, but if you are accustomed to having these at the holidays, they are worth the smile on the kid's faces.  Even though my kids are all grown up now, they had these every year for their entire lives and then we could not find them starting about two years ago.  So this treat was well worth the price and effort.

review/text: To help eliminate some of the confusion about buying Skinless and Boneless Sardines packed in pure olive oil, I bought the Reese brand in both the 3.75 oz can and the 4.375 oz can and compared them side by side.<br /><br />Comparison:<br />3.75 oz Reese Skinless and Boneless Sardines packed in Pure Olive Oil:<br />The package on the 3.75 oz size stated that the sardines are a product of Morocco. Inside the 3.75 oz can were 3 fairly large sardines. The sardines were packed nicely laying on their sides head to tail, very clean looking, and mostly intact. The flavor was fairly mild but still very good. I was slightly disappointed about the size of these as I tend to like the flavor and texture of smaller sardines.<br /><br />For this reason, and because of some slight flaking of one of the sardines in the can, I am rating these sardines a "3.7", and rounding this up to a "4" out of "5". I expect that the smaller sardines may hold their form better throughout the canning process.<br /><br />Comparing the 4.375 oz Reese Skinless and Boneless Sardines packed in Pure Olive Oil:<br />The package on the 4.375 oz size stated that the sardines are a product of Portugal. The sardines in this can were smaller than those in the 3.75 oz can but were still slightly larger than what I'm used to. There were 4 sardines in the can packed side by side head to tail. They were nearly perfect being fully intact. The flavor and texture was very good. I noticed that there seemed to be a bit more residual moisture in these sardines and also mixed in the olive oil. I can't flaw the sardines for this as some may enjoy the additional moisture which was flavorful and didn't negatively impact the firm texture of these sardines.<br />Overall I'm rating this 4.375 oz size "4.2" which I'll round down to a "4" out of "5". If this were a 1 - 10 rating system the 4.375 oz can would definitely stand out as a better product. Unfortunately on a 1 - 5 star rating basis it was necessary to rate both cans at "4".<br /><br />Please Note:<br />In checking Amazon's current listing for the 4.375 oz can of Reese Skinless and Boneless Sardines packed in Pure Olive Oil, it states that the sardines are a product of Morocco (7/29/10). As stated above the 4.375 size I rated was from Portugal. I've had great sardines from both countries but I'm still learning what's best. After all, looking to the future, who knows what may be found in the waters near either of these places. For now sardines appear to be a very healthy food choice.<br /><br />The nutritional data on both sizes stated that there were 2 servings per can and the calories stated 110 per serving if drained. So if you eat a full can, it's actually 220 calories if drained.<br /><br />Interesting that both the 4.375 oz and the 3.75 oz. cans state that there are 2 servings per can when drained. Both state 110 calories per serving even though the cans are quite different in size. If I ever do another comparison, I'll measure the amount of oil and liquid per can versus the amount of solids.<br /><br />I really like it when products are carefully reviewed but I rarely write a review. I wrote this review as a way to contribute and do my share. Good luck shopping and finding your favorites!

review/summary: very good
review/text: I have been eating sardines for about a year.  Brunswick in oil is my favorite.  I tryed king oscar and they were good. I would rate these as almost as good...but I payed $1 per can and they're good for 4 1/2 years!!! In my opinion brunswick makes the best sardines for the money. I would buy from a local store when they are on sale!!! I just bought 35 cans tonight....the cashier always gives me a funny look...but it doesn't bother me!!! (3/13/12 Big Fat Paulyyy)

review/summary: you have GOT to try these
review/text: I have searched high and low for anything that would satisfy my sweet tooth and chocolate cravings without a ton of fat and sugar.  Well I am now addicted to these.  I LOVE THEM.  I have two a day at least - bad days 3 - very satisfying - feel full afterwards.  With a glass of skim milk is a great snack.  Dropped all candy snacks and other bars - having just these for my snacks - and I've lost 22 lbs - and I do not exercise.  I couldn't be happier.  If you have chocolate cravings or crave snacks - even late at night - you have got to try these.  This is my only review ever - only time I felt so strong about something that I took the time to do it.  Hope you all enjoy as much as I do.  I have them delivered monthly from Amazon automatically for a better price - with free shipping.

I love these, they taste oh so good.

review/summary: A Tasty "Do-No-Harm" Snack
review/text: At 130 calories, 6 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fat, this is a guilt-free treat. This is not your usual soft, chewy, sugary granola bar; this is for the dark chocolate lover, the cocoa flavor intensified by the addition of coffee, a trick that every gourmet cook knows. Kashi's "Seven Whole Grains" which include "hard red wheat"--not gluten free, sorry!) add 4 grams of fiber and a satisfying chewy crunchiness. This particular flavor is hard to find. Often I am greeted by empty shelves, so I am glad that I could find them here and set up a regular shipment! And by the way, these were part of my recent 28 pound weight loss. They certainly helped fight the cravings for the dark-chocolate and almond confections that are my downfall!

review/summary: Nutritious dark mocha almond dessert bar!
review/text: A nutritionist recommended Kashi products to me. If you're hankering for a Snicker candy bar, these might not satisfy you. However, if you want a crunchy, nutty, dark chocolate treat that makes you feel good after eating, you may want to try these.  They are low in sugar--only 6 gms--about the same as in a cup of Cheerios or Total.  The nutritionist said to think of sugar as poison--your body wants to eliminate sugar before fat, so stay low in sugar. I keep one of these bars in my purse when I'm out doing errands in case I get hungry.  I love the dark chocolate chips and nutty crunch. One bar at 130 calories is quite satisfying and is a great go-to treat when you want a little sweetness in your day.<br /><br />One bar is only 3 points on Weight Watcher's point system. I took a box to my Weight Watcher's meeting to recommend them for a healthy snack.  I've lost 30 pounds and reversed diabetes in the past 2 years eating healthy foods: low-sugar, low-fat natural vegetable/fruits/protein/dairy diet with little to no artificially flavored and processed foods.  These bars are my treat when I'm desiring a little fun without the guilt. I haven't found a chocolate dessert treat that's lower in calories/sugar and healthier. If you eat a bar a day, this is a great price on Amazon if you are on automatic monthly delivery and beats my local supermarket price.

review/summary: Scrumtrulescent
review/text: There is always a feeling of anxiety as I enter the granola bar aisle at the grocery store. Will the Kashi Dark Mocha Almond granola bars be sold out? Will my morning commutes be granola free? Is this just the beginning of my First World problems?<br /><br />First of all, these are delicious. Other "health food" granola options taste like cardboard or are too dry/hard to eat. On the flip side, other cloyingly sweet kids granola bars are just as unhealthy as a candy bar. The Kashi Dark Mocha Almond strike the perfect balance between the two. They are substantial enough as a breakfast, without resorting to empty calories.<br /><br />The best thing about this: it's a 6-pack of 6 bars each! Plus, they keep long enough so the 36 bars don't go to waste. With Amazon shipping (and a Prime account), I have these within two days to satisfy the craving. Plus, even when every other granola bar is in stock, the packages of Kashi Dark Mocha Almond are always sold out at the store -- Amazon saves the day again.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Scrumtrulescent<br />-Filling<br />-Healthy dose of complex fiber without excessive sugars<br />-36-pack!!<br /><br />Cons:<br />-I feel shameful if I eat three per day<br />-They're too easy, other breakfast foods are neglected<br />-The chocolate chips are tenuous -- Don't sit on a dropped chip for a 30 minute car ride

review/summary: Terrible!
review/text: Just received my Kashi Granola bars and it was disgust at first taste.  The bars are strangely shiny, smell of butter, and a butter or cooking oil flavor dominates at taste.  I've tried many protein bars and like most Kashi products, however these were a big miss.  So awful I can only assume it's a manufacturing mistake.  Stay away from this product until current batch is removed or buy a in small quantities at a local store.  I could only eat half of one bar so the other 35 will quickly find the dumpster.

review/summary: great granola bars, unfortunate packaging
review/text: There's plenty being said here about how great these bars are, and I completely agree.  My review is about the packaging.  These bars used to come simply in thick plastic shrink wrap.  Now they come with packing tape wrapped around the 6-pack of boxes as well as in thick plastic shrink wrap.  I don't mind the shrink wrap, but the tape is especially annoying.  It makes it difficult to open the individual boxes, to separate the boxes from each other, and in some cases, it damages the boxes when you remove the tape.<br /><br />To the packager: please stop using this tape and go back to just using the plastic shrink wrap.

review/summary: Delicious perfection!
review/text: I was looking for an easy snack to take with me on vacation to have while I was out and about all day.  I stumbled upon these at Wal-Mart and was attracted to 1) The nutritonal content [reasonable calories, good amount of fiber and enough protein to tide me over] and 2) The word "mocha" in the name, as I love all things coffee.<br /><br />These were inexpensive, DELICIOUS, and not too sweet - which is important for me because if something is really sweet (like most granola bars are), I lose control and end up eating two or three at a time, like I would with a cookie or any other sweet treat.  But these are perfect - just enough sweetness to "hit the spot" without triggering a sugar craving.  I guess if you are used the typical sugary granola bars [Nature Valley, Quaker Oats and chocolate], these might not be indulgent enough for you.  But again, I like that these are not crazy-sweet.<br /><br />The mocha is more like a hint of coffee flavor - just enough to enhance the taste of the chocolate chips and almonds.  So if you're not a big coffee person, there's a good chance you'd still like these bars. And if you *are* a coffee person, you'll certainly enjoy these. They have a sprinkle of chocolate chips on top, and whole, yummy almonds throughout.  I bet they would be mighty good broken up into pieces and put on top of some greek yogurt, along with sliced strawberries.  What a breakfast that would make!<br /><br />These are definitely a winner, and I plan on buying them again and again.  Highly recommended!

review/text: These are the absolute best bars I've ever tasted. They are chocolate-ly and not overly sweet. They manage to be both chewy and crunchy in just the right amounts. The coffee taste is very light and blends well with the other ingredients.<br /><br />These little bars are only 130 each, provide 6 grams of protein and are made with whole grains and oatmeal. I eat these every day as an afternoon snack. Around 2 or 3, I'm craving a candy bar but I eat one of these instead and I'm ok until dinner. Saves me about 150 calories a day. The only criticism that I have for these bars is that there are not enough almonds in them. They are so good though that I still have to give them 5 stars.

review/summary: Favorite Granola Bar
review/text: I have tried a good amount of granola bars in my time. I usually use various granola bars when doing everything from backpacking to snowbarding for hours to simple snacks throughout the day to full meals at times. Being a huge fan of both dark chocolate and coffee, this natural bar from Kashi is a great snack at any time of the day. Quality ingredients and a reasonable price is great for what you get out of these bars. The chewy texture is great when you bite into an occasional almond and there isnt too much dark chocolate bits, but just enough to go well with the mocha flavor. I usually eat one with my coffee in the morning while at the office when I am short on time or in the evening when I dont want a big meal, but want something reasonably healthy. The bars are great when short on time and need a quick pick me up. I use them with some juice in the morning when just waking and going for a spin class. Easy on the stomach at least for me. Great buy!

review/text: This bar is just too awesome to put into words. It is a Chocolate Mocha granola bar that actually tastes like Chocolate Mocha! It really is one of those rare products that have low fat and the entire flavor it promotes. The funny thing is I ordered it for myself and gave a few to my workout buddies, big mistake since they just kept coming back for more bars promising to `get me back'. Maybe that is true since I saw them order a few boxes but since these are highly addictive I think they may keep their `stash' to themselves. Well any way if you are watching your weight, working out or simply like granola type products I recommend these nifty Dark Mocha Almond bars. Funny thing is I was just looking for a few healthy snack products to satisfy my sweet tooth and really didn't expect them to be this good, oh and they are.
