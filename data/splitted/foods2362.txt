review/summary: Thank you, Amazon! Zagnuts are the best!!
review/text: Thank you, Amazon! Oh my God, I can finally find Zagnuts! These are hands down, no question the absolute best candy bar on earth. When I was a kid, I searched every candy store I visited in hope of finding Zagnuts. Nobody carried them. The only sellers were random gas stations that I would come across during a family road trip. When I found one, I would empty my pockets of every dollar I had to buy as many as possible.<br /><br />I just received my package yesterday. Yesterday was the first time I had had a Zagnut in about 10 years. It's exactly how I remember it. Just to give you an idea how much I love these things, yesterday was the first candy bar I had had in over one year...no Snickers, Mars Bars,...anything like that. Yet I've already had two Zagnuts this morning. Cheers.

review/summary: O, U feel like a Nut?????
review/text: Some people are nutty. Some candy bars are nutty. Sometimes you feel like a nut. Sometimes U likes to chomp on some nuts. Sometimes U are a nut. Its pretty nutty to not like peanut butter but like peanut butter flavored candy bars. Its even nuttier to like inferior peanut butter tasting candy bars. This would apply here-----Zagnut is clearly inferior to Butterfinger, or even Clark bars. This is like eating the inside of a candy bar. Sure U can eat this nutty bar. But U might as well eat nuts, like U likes to. O, do U see U eating nuts?

review/summary: A Good Birthday Present Solution
review/text: If you are not sure what to send someone for their birthday, this birthday gift box tower just might be the solution you are looking for.<br /><br />Because of the Birthday Bear that is included in this gift tower, it may appeal more to the  female persuasion initially, but the enclosed contents, a great mix of sweet and savory can be enjoyed by everyone, from young people to older adults.<br /><br />There are a total of 4 Individual Gold Gift Boxes in graduated sizes, all tied up with a nice green and accented purple ribbon bow, which ties all 4 gift boxes up neatly.<br /><br />The Savories Included Are:  A Round Box Of Pepper Jack Cheese Wedges, which comes along with A Small Stainless Steel Cheese Knife, A Box Of Three Pepper Water Crackers, A Savory Snack Mix Box, A Bag Of Dill Seasoned Sourdough Pretzels, and A Small Box Of Smoked Almonds.<br /><br />The Sweets Included Are:  A Box Of 10 Different Flavors Of Jelly Belly's, A Bag Of Fleur De Sel Caramel Popcorn, A Box Of Sweet Butter Cookies, A Small Box Of Licorice Candies, which I did not try, because I do not care for the taste of licorice, and A Box Of Raspberry Snap Cookies, which I did try.  They were very tasty and crunchy, a new taste treat for me.<br /><br />There is even One Sweet/Savory item, A Box Of Cranberry Harvest Medley, which is a combination of dried cranberries and almonds, very tasty.<br /><br />The final item in this Gift Box Tower is a very cute, seems to be a very well made sort of ivory colored Happy Birthday Bear, that wears a Purple Happy Birthday Hat, with Curly Ribbons of pink, green and purple colors. The bear will be a nice keepsake after you eat up all of the goodies, which are 2 Pounds in total.<br /><br />The food items I did try were fresh and tasty.  The 4 Gold Gift Boxes will be resused, would be perfect to use for anyone's gifts since the color is gender neutral, would be wonderful to keep on hand, or to keep for yourself to store things.  The Gold Gift Boxes are not the real flimsy kind.  A few of mine tho were alittle scuffed up, both inside and outside, but you would probably use tissue paper inside the boxes anyway, if you were using/reusing these boxes for gifts.  I notice everything, because Iam very detail oriented, but it's not a big issue.<br /><br />I love things that can be reused like these boxes, something like this bear to have after you eat all of the goodies, even the ribbon can be reused, so in this sense I also feel that this is a very practical gift too.<br /><br />I love all of the individual colorful packaging too.<br /><br />I think this Gift Box Tower would be a very good idea to add to your what should I get for someone's birthday?, if you aren't sure exactly what someone would like, or even if you do know what they like, even say for a office gift.  I think this Gift Box Tower would work well for many employment situations.<br /><br />This Gift Box set may just be the problem solver you need for your next gift giving dilemma!

review/summary: Perfect Gift Package For A Family!!
review/text: I was surprised by the quality, quantity & variety of the snacks and treats - DELIGHTFULLY surprised!! This would make the perfect gift for a family of 3-4 people. Something for everyone (Nana went nuts over the almonds - no pun intended & my son loved the cookies & Jelly Bellies), and everything was completely delicious (my favorite was the large bag of raspberry snaps)...it even included a cheese spreader with a nice wooden handle (my husband enjoyed the pepper jack & gourmet crackers)! Each item was larger than the snack packages that you find in other gift baskets - more than one serving per package.<br /><br />The birthday bear is well put-together & not some cheap stuffed toy (when I tugged on the fur & seams, nothing came loose).<br /><br />The beautiful boxes are an added bonus...not only are they a lovely gold, but they are VERY sturdy, and could easily be reused for future gifts. In the meantime, they store inside of one another, like matryoshka dolls, saving space.<br /><br />I've seen similar gift packages for $50 to $90, but they weren't as impressive as this tower set.

review/summary: Beyond my expectations
review/text: When this arrived I was confused by the large box it was shipped in, I didn't remember ordering anything that would be as big as it was. When I pulled out the tower I was very pleasantly surprised at its size and the content! I thought something half its size was going to show up.  The listing doesn't have a price and I can judge well at the size of some things by the price. I immediately sampled each item with my husband and this is what we thought of everything.<br /><br />Jelly Bellys never let me down. The box has 10 flavors: Very Cherry, Watermelon, Pear, Green Apple, Tangerine, Blueberry, Buttered Popcorn, Cinnamon, Coconut, Licorice. Serves 3.<br /><br />Smoked almonds were very, uh, smoky and a bit too salty. They were okay. Serves 2.<br /><br />Sonoma pepper jack cheese had a nice flavor but the texture is strange. I don't know if that is because it wasn't refrigerated yet or what. I'll stick with eating it on crackers instead of eating it alone. Serves 6.<br /><br />Angelina's butter cookies were so-so. Serves 3.<br /><br />Dill sourdough pretzel nuggets were great! I only had one, but I look forward to them as a snack later tonight. Serves 2.<br /><br />Licorice Petites. My husband and I hate licorice, so I can't review it. Three individually wrapped pieces come in the little box. I'm saving them for when my dad visits. Serves 3.<br /><br />Raspberry Snaps were different. I've never tried anything like it. Not overly sweet and a good texture, they were dusted in a light pink powdered sugar. Serves about 2<br /><br />Cranberry Harvest Medley is I think my favorite of the bunch. Dried cranberries with roasted almonds go so well together. Serves 2.<br /><br />Caramel popcorn was delish and it only has 100 calories. The box has one decent sized serving in it.<br /><br />Three pepper water crackers were good, especially with the pepper jack cheese. They aren't too peppery and have some kind of light seasoning. Serves 4.<br /><br />The cheese spreader came in handy.<br /><br />Savory snack mix was yummy. It tastes similar to Gardetto snack mix you can find at any grocery store. Serves 2.<br /><br />The bear is really cute. I love him!<br /><br />I wish I knew what the cost of this item was going to be so I could say if it is worth buying. Judging by my experience with gift towers I can see the company charging roughly $80 for it which considering what it is and the variety you get I'd say is worth it. It will certainly bring a smile to the recipient's face!

review/summary: Packaging is the most impressive part...
review/text: This 2-pound "Happy Birthday Tower" comes in BEAUTIFUL gold-wrapped boxes daintily tied up with a pretty ribbon and topped with a bow.<br /><br />Here's the deal, though: you don't get to choose the contents.  This particular collection has Smoked Almonds, Jellie Bellies, Sonoma Jack Pepper Jack Cheese, Angelina's Butter Cookies, Dill Seasoned Sourdough Pretzel Nuggets, Licorice Petites, Raspberry Snaps, Cranberry Harvest Medley, Fleur del Sel Caramel Popcorn, Three Pepper Water Crackers, Cheese Spreader, Savory Snack Mix, Happy Birthday Bear.<br /><br />Out of this bunch there were several I/We weren't interested in very much.  Now HERE's an idea (because truly, the boxes/wrapping make this an ideal "gift" in a "somebody must LIKE me, because just LOOK at how pretty these gold boxes are!" kind of way.)<br /><br />The customer needs to be able to CHOOSE the contents (with the cost of the whole tower adjusted accordingly.)  Someone wrote earlier about the "oreo generation" - but if you had someone with a serious double-stuff jones, they'd probably rather receive oreos than Dill Seasoned Sourdough Pretzel Nuggets. I'm just saying - have a page of "choose your contents here" then the vendor wraps YOUR selections up in the pretty gold boxes.  NOW you've got something.

review/text: I loved the way this looked in the beautiful gold boxes and ribbon in a tall tower.  I was a bit disappointed though when I opened it all because it seemed like nothing all that special.  The foods inside were fine but they looked like they were going to be amazing by the packaging.  Something with a fancy name Ive never heard before was chex mix and a few of the other things came in very tiny quantities.  The Birthday Bear was by far the best part.  It is adorable.

review/summary: 3.5 Stars - Inconsistent mix of quality in food and packaging
review/text: The picture looks better than the actual product, I'll begin by saying. When I received the package, I was surprised by how cheap the gold-colored boxes looked. Some of the gold paper was peeled off or scratched, and in some of the boxes the white lining paper was also ripped, showing the gray cardboard underneath. I had thought I could reuse those boxes as gift boxes, because they are pretty sturdy, but I won't because of the scratches and rips. Instead of boxes bursting with snacks, each box only contained two to three items, in most cases leaving a lot of empty space. Though overall there was plenty of food, it didn't seem like it because of the presentation. No colored tissue paper or anything to make the boxes look fuller.<br /><br />The selection and quality of food also varied:<br /><br />Smoked Almonds: I like smoked flavoring but something was off. Too strong? They were okay.<br /><br />Jellie Bellies: A medium sized box of them.<br /><br />Sonoma Jack Pepper Jack Cheese: I liked how they were individually wrapped into wedges. A<br />spreader was included! A nice addition.<br /><br />Angelina's Butter Cookies: These are just like those Danish cookies in the blue tins.<br /><br />Dill Seasoned Sourdough Pretzel Nuggets: Much too salty; they could have been so much better if there was less salt.<br /><br />Raspberry Snaps: These were delicious!Biscuits with rasberry flavored powder and flecks.<br /><br />Cranberry Harvest Medley: Good because it's an almond-cranberry mix. But nothing special.<br /><br />Fleur del Sel Caramel Popcorn: This was good. The popcorn was crunchy and didn't stick to your teeth.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers: Went well with the cheese. I liked them.<br /><br />Savory Snack Mix: The same as Chex Mix.<br /><br />Licorice Petites: haven't tried<br /><br />Happy Birthday Bear: Eh. Not so cute that I would give it to anyone over 8 years old.<br /><br />The serving size of packages like the Cranberry Medley and Savory Snack Mix, pretzels, licorice and popcorn would only feed about one person.<br /><br />Overall, I'm slightly disappointed; everything seemed kind of cheap to me, rather than gourmet, which is what I was expecting. One would proably do better to make their own gift tower than drop $50 or so on this one, in my opinion.

review/summary: What a wonderful surprise!
review/text: I have to admit, I loved opening this package!  It was wonderfully wrapped with the gold boxes and a beautiful ribbon as shown.  Inside each box was a surprise, or more accurately, several surprises.<br /><br />I saved this to share with my staff at our monthly staff meeting.  Everyone seemed to enjoy the variety.  Licorice petites were flavorful.  Just right for our resident licorice addict.  I, of course, went for the carmel popcorn and the nuts.  The little Raspberry Snaps melted in my mouth.  The variety pack of Jelly Bellies were a big hit as were the dill-flavored sourdough pretzel nuggets. In fact, nearly everything was tasty although a few things, such as the butter cookies, were not so special.<br /><br />The Happy Birthday bear in the bottom box was a surprise.  Very cute.<br /><br />The only thing that seemed missing to me was any kind of chocolate.  Folks, if you're going to send this to women, you NEED some chocolate in there.<br /><br />All in all, this would make a welcome family gift for several people to enjoy a treat.

review/text: This birthday package was huge! And the packaging was lovely. Once I unwrapped it, there wasn't *quite* as much inside as the multiple boxes suggested there might be, but what was in there was high quality: several trail mixes, jelly beans, cookies, a stuffed bear, cheese, crackers, nuts, pretzels, candies. The individual packages were small (but NOT tiny), but there were a few of them. I would say there would most certainly be something for everyone in the package, and the snacks were quality - I'm a relatively picky snacker and there was nothing in there I wouldn't eat.

review/summary: LOOKS BETTER THAN IT IS
review/text: This is a B-I-G package, and it looks great. However, the contents leave much to be desired. First, I take exception to the fact that the products are just sitting in each box (with the exception of the final large one which houses the teddy bear and has some crushed paper at the bottom to protect it). Some tissue would help relieve the bare-bones look of each box's contents. Second, better than half the products are just not all that tasty. The Sonoma Jacks Pepper Jack is really unpleasant - packaged in wedges in a round container. The cheese has an unpleasant, wet texture and isn't at all appealing. The Tavolare snack is just odd. The smoked almonds have an overly salty baconish taste, and the pretzels are also overly salty. The best things are the Licorice Petites, The Fleur de Sel Caramel popcorn (which was my absolute favorite) and the Raspberry snaps. I suspect this is an expensive gift and based on my taste samplings, I wouldn't recommend it.

review/summary: Great gift for sophisticated palates, but several products were open on arrival
review/text: My first impression of this gift tower when taken out of the box was that it is surprisingly large. Those who are experienced with ordering from gourmet food markets may have become accustomed to miniaturized products - those stick-of-butter-sized cheese sticks and sausage logs, for instance. This tower doesn't just weigh several pounds, but it's tall. It's also pretty. The gold boxes are sturdy enough to withstand shipping and the ribbon was attractively displayed. Everything looked from the outside exactly as it should.<br /><br />Don't let the presence of the jelly beans and the teddy bear fool you into thinking that this is a child's gift. Most of the items will appeal to a more sophisticated palate. My 14-year-old son was extremely interested in the idea of the box but lost that interest pretty quickly once the contents were unpacked. Of course, there are kids with more discriminating tastes, but the Oreo generation may be generally unexcited.<br /><br />The teddy bear included is small but excellent quality - decorative and highly detailed.<br /><br />While I myself am happy with the diversity of items, there was one major issue that detracted seriously from the impact of this item as a gift: three of the packages were open. Two of them - the raspberry snaps and butter cookies - looked as though it could have been damage in the packing process, since the boxes they were contained in were undamaged. Since the inner packages were not breached, the fact that the top of one and the bottom of the other was open was not a major issue. However, the top was completely detached from the Sonoma Jacks Gourmet Cheese Wedges package - almost as if somebody had deliberately pulled the paper strip keeping the package closed - and the soft wedges were loose in the box. The only way I can imagine this happening in shipping is if the box was shaken so much that the weight of the cheese wedges themselves tore the paper strip closure. If that's what happened, I surely hope that the company will modify it's packing practices to keep it from happening in the future. While they are still wrapped in tinfoil and still edible, it's a disappointing failure of display in what should be an otherwise spectacular gift.<br /><br />Other reviews don't mention this, so it's possible that something out of the ordinary failed in my product, which I was given as a free review copy. But I have to review it as a I received it. While I was impressed by the size, quantity and quality of the selection, the three open packages - and especially the cheese - give a major hit to my satisfaction. If not for that, this would have received 5 stars. Because of that - unless they fix it so that it can't happen again - I can't give it more than 3.

review/summary: Its like drinking battery acid
review/text: I'd give this negative stars if I could. After steeping according to directions I ended up with a pot of tea that had a very bitter, chemical taste, so i threw that batch out. I tried again, steeping it as you would a green tea, 175 degrees less than 1 minute. This was drinkable, but not good. The taste was very astringent, somewhat bitter. I actually got a sore throat from drinking it. I then tried blending small amounts of it with other teas. I tried 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp gyokuro, the green was completely overpowered by the white. Threw that batch out as well. Then I tried blending 1/2 tsp silver yin with 2 tsp monkey picked oolong. The result was okay, but then I went to the bathroom. My urine smelled like burnt plastic!?!?!?!? It was so bad that I actually searched the house to find the source of the chemical fire. It was the next time I went that I realized where the odor was coming from. I've never experienced anything like that before. Bottom line, I probably won't be purchasing ANY teavana products again.

Cheaper white teas from other brands are much better. Rishi, H&S, and numerous other tea companies have better white tea. In all honesty, this tastes worse than bagged tea. Teavana has some good products, but they are just too overpriced.<br /><br />Did I mention how horrible Teavana's customer service is? They don't respond to emails,etc. You have to wait on the phone for hours. Simply unacceptable. Feel free to check their facebook wall to see customers voicing the same concern.

review/summary: Not like they used to be
review/text: These donuts used to be a favorite treat for me and my family when I was growing up.  They were good out of the box or, we liked to put them in the refrigerator and let the chocolate coating get crackly.  I don't know what the company did to them, but there is a definite change.  My family doesn't buy them at all anymore after a few bad boxes.  We thought maybe it was a bad batch the first time, but no, we then tried boxes at different times.  It's just not the same recipe or ingredients anymore.  The yellow cake part is a little drier than it used to be and not as flavorful as it was.  But the most changed part is the coating.  The chocolate is like a fake wax coating that leaves a greasy feel in your mouth.  I suspect it is from all the hydrogenated oil in them, and probably very little or no real chocolate.  I could barely finish one donut each time I tried them as opposed to when I could eat a few in one sitting.  They've never been healthy-they're donuts after all-but the ingredients must've been higher quality in previous years.  My whole family agreed they are not the same, and not good.<br /><br />We remember many delicious Entenmann's products throughout the 80s up until the past 5 years or so.  My favorite was the Marshmallow Iced Devil's Food Cake.  I tried it twice over the past year and it is not the same at all.  It leaves a very strange aftertaste, and the frosting no longer tastes like marshmallow.  It's also stiff and not even slightly fluffy like it used to be.  I would give it one star if I could rate it here.  I heard the company was sold to another at some point, which I suppose then changed the recipes.  Anyone who tastes these products for the first time now is totally missing out on what Entenmann's used to be.<br /><br />I'm rating these 2 stars because they aren't as bad as the cake was, and they are passable for anyone who doesn't remember the way they originally tasted and is desperate for a donut fix.  But if you hate fake chocolate and oil-based coatings, do not buy.<br /><br />If I'm going to eat unhealthy snack foods or desserts such as donuts, cakes, and cookies, I want them to taste great or at least good.  This is way beyond disappointing and not worth eating anymore.  Please Entenmann's go back to your old recipes, they were great.  We miss them.

review/text: I'm married to a 40 year old cookie monster - he has rarely met a cookie he didn't like.  Unfortunately - these cookies were ones that he didn't like.  They have a strange flavor to them... they have that undercooked taste to make them "soft" but that isn't the strange flavor.  I am not one that really enjoys that undercooked taste but there is still an off flavor to these cookies, most noticed in the snickerdoodle variety but still evident over the chocolate in the chocolate chip cookie.  Chocolate usually covers all problems, but not with this cookie.  My cookie monster recomends that you purchase a different cookie gift as these were veery disappointing.

review/text: I tried the chicken rub and it was pretty darned good.  I have been trying to cut down on salt.  However, if you want to save a ton of money, just go into Walmart and buy these in the spice section;  they cost about $2.80 per jar.  Quite a bit less than the price here.  I can not believe what they are charging.

Best used as a cooking spice rather than adding it afterward. This does not smell like curry as one reviewer suggested; the scent of this product is; however, of cumin, a spice commonly used in southwestern dishes.

review/summary: This dogfood is great!
review/text: I started using Holistic Select when I got an English Mastiff puppy because it was well recommended by a number of breeders. Georgia, the puppy, did so well on their food I decided, two years ago, to try the Senior food for our elderly Golden Retriever. Soccer had been on Purina Dog Chow all his life. He was really starting to act and show his age. He was overweight, slowing down, and getting gimpy from laying around too much. What a difference!! Now he is much more trim, playful again, and actually runs around the yard - at 13!! The only difference has been the change in food so I give Holistic Select complete credit for this remarkable transformation. I discovered that I could buy Holistic Select products from Amazon about a year ago. Their price is a few bucks cheaper than the pet stores where I was buying and delivery is free! Since I live in a rural county, this saves me driving to "the big city" to get their dog food. Having it delivered makes my life much easier!!

review/summary: They coulda had something
review/text: I wanted to like this. I really did. I like the company's approach. Simple, minimalistic, natural ingredients to bring soda back from it's junk, empty calorie stigma. It's something to be applauded. But they missed the mark here. Is it less sweet? Certainly. Is it crisp? Sure. Is it refreshing? Yea, I could give them that. I'll even give them the claim that the soda doesn't overpower. They're damned right it doesn't because the flavor is just lacking!<br /><br />They call this one the Blood Orange flavor. I've had blood oranges and if you've had blood oranges, you love them and you wish you could get more. They're flavorful, sweet, delicious, and juicy every time. It's like a miracle. There's none of that here. If they used blood oranges in this, I mourn the loss of those noble fruits. They perished in vain. It's as if someone took a bottle of club soda and accidentally dripped a couple of drops of orange juice or some sort of citrus based juice into it. That's about all you could taste. Is it oranges? Maybe. It smells like oranges so it certainly smells good. But you don't buy soda for it's scent.<br /><br />They could have something, if only their soda was more than fancy club soda.

review/text: I picked up a box of the blueberry treats while vacationing in DC as a treat for the dogs. I loved the tiny size because we're doing a lot of training at the moment and the dogs were putting on weight (two toy poodles and a Lab#. Who knew that all three would be crazy for the blueberry treats - all three run to the cookie dish and sit patiently until they get a couple of blueberry bones #they are small treats which allows me to give two or three treats instead of breaking one into pieces). Even the Lab, who has had weight issues for years, loves these treats. Who knew dogs liked blueberries!

review/summary: Some liked them, some ignored them
review/text: My 6 Greyhounds received the chicken pot pie flavored treats as an early Easter surprise from their Auntie. Keeping in mind the size of my dogs, these treats are the teeniest, tiniest things I think I've seen. Maybe an inch long and 1/8" high/deep, the dogs' canine teeth are bigger than these treats. Keeping in mind a treat this small will most likely be swallowed whole, I distributed them slowly to each pup. It was as if they were gulping air...I don't think the ones with enough teeth to chew even tasted them. The 2 with minimum teeth for whom I must moosh everything up got theirs crushed up in yogurt...those two girls wouldn't eat the yogurt. So, I can't tell if my pups like these or not; most didn't even taste them as they went down the hatch too quickly without chewing; the other two didn't like what they did to their favorite treat since losing their teeth, yogurt.<br /><br />They are wheat and corn free, listed as 100% natural and the ingredients list on the back of the little box are:<br />oat flour, rolled oats, potato flour, chicken broth, carrots, celery, canola oil, eggs, baking powder<br /><br />For the price, one can put those ingredients together at home (I will swap potato flour for whole wheat flour) and bake them yourself. Even if it takes a few tries to get the measurements right, the dogs will still eat them and you can make them any size that is appropriate for your pet(s). If baking them as hard treats is too time consuming for you, do what I do: mix it up like a meatloaf, bake it, cut into appropriately sized treat pieces, and keep in the frig. Easy enough and one can use leftovers from a meal rather than start with all new ingredients. Probably healthier for your pet too.<br /><br />However, we must still thank Auntie for allowing us to try something new. If it were not for the tiny size of these treats, they would most likely have been a great big hit here.

review/summary: DELICIOUS!!!
review/text: I first bought these preserved walnuts at a local specialty gourmet and wine shop because I was curious having never seen anything like them before. The shop person suggested slicing thinly and serving with cheese and crackers. Both the texture and flavor were unexpected and wonderful. The walnuts look like giant dark olives as they are made from immature green walnuts whose shells are still undeveloped and attached. They have a very interesting texture; not crunchy like a fresh walnut but dense and somewhat juicy from the preserving syrup. Everyone who has tried them at our house has LOVED them. So far I have only served them sliced on a cheese tray but I intend on edging my next Italian Cheesecake with the preserved walnuts diced. There are interesting flavors that dance around on your tongue; kind of cinnamony. I've given jars of these as gifts and they have been well received. I will continue to buy these 3 jars at a time on Amazon as the price is better than my local store but in a pinch would pay the $13 per jar locally if I ran out - they are that good.

Believe me, I had thought that instant tasted way better then "real" coffee until a I had a cup of this java.  I was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away.<br /><br />Also, the shipment was very fast!  I had ordered this with other items (books and DVDs).  The coffee came in within the week but the other items didn't come in at all.  Infact every time I checked the progress, amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date.  I couldn't understand this at all!  I had to cancel the rest of the order and buy the items elsewhere.  Go figure.

review/summary: If you really prefer dark roast coffee...
review/text: ... these Costa Rican beans are alright. I am not a huge fan of dark roast coffees, particularly when it comes to Costa Rican coffees, but my wife is and she gave this product a solid thumbs up. It has the usual Costa Rican flavor - citrusy, crisp "attack", light-bodied - and the extra roasting time seems to round out the "finish" nicely. The dark roast does cast a stronger cloud over the entire brew. The dark roast style also lowers the caffeine content quite a bit, so if you like an extra caffeine kick in the morning, this coffee is not for you. This would be a solid after-dinner brew or afternoon coffee to sit back and enjoy.

review/summary: Best Coffee
review/text: I was staying at a friends and found this in their kitchen, not knowing what it was. When another visiting coffee drinker like myself awoke and we tried the resulting brew we looked at each other and said, "What IS this stuff!"<br /><br />I've ordered it from their website (they do like to spam you if you GIVE them your email... hello), but I find amazon more convenient because I order from here a fair bit.<br /><br />A couple of years ago I was making coffee for a Costa Rican friend, and I was going to offer him something else when he saw that I had some dark roast Cafe Britt and stopped me, asking why I was holding out on him. I'd thought he'd be not so interested in coffee from his own country, but he said it was his favourite and the best coffee out there. Not only that but people from Costa Rica, when they buy Cafe Britt, very sadly can not get the stuff we get abroad because it's of a higher quality set aside for export. I feel a little bad about that, but I still like the coffee.

review/summary: The Best Coffee on Planet Earth, Bar None
review/text: My wife and I honeymooned in Costa Rica back in 2005 and we loved the coffee we were served; it is robust and well rounded and low acid so it doesn't upset my stomach after two or three full cups. We have been buying this coffee ever since and I have trouble drinking any other brand; even Dunkin Donuts blend is anemic next to this coffee. I think the Poas blend is the best coffee in the Britt line, but we often mix some Dark Roast or Espresso with it to jack it up when necessary. The 11 for 10 bag deal on their site is a bargain. This is great coffee, day in and day out. You will likely enjoy it as much as we do.

I ordered it immediately, when I recieved it I was dismayed to find that it contained MSG.  A big No, No, for me. I never tried it so I don't know if it tastes good or bad.

review/text: Lucky Charms are my own private revenge for a childhood deprived of sugary name brand cereals. As far as nutrition it's not the best but it's not the worst either - each cup has around 140 calories and provides 14% of your daily calcium and Vitamin C requirements, plus it has almost 40% of the iron you need! It still isn't a filling or nutritionally adequate breakfast but it's not too bad when you're craving some sweet snacky junk food :)

review/text: I have been on a crusade to lower my sodium intake and when I found this product I was pleased. I don't use Ketchup on anything but do use it in several recipes so the no salt was a real factor.<br /><br />I have never liked ketchup on anything, even fries, but I do like this product. It has a great tangyness and full flavor without any salt!!!<br /><br />I used it for a meatloaf recipe I have and it came out really good.<br /><br />One small drawback is that it seems to have a relitively short shelf life so I just keep the extra bottles in the fridge.<br /><br />This is a fantastic product.  More food product companies need to take this route.  We need healthier food and at the same time it tastes better when done right.  Kudos to Hinze for a great product.

He doesn't eat people food, has a a bowl of dry available all the time as well as half a can of wet twice a day. Also, he hates beef wet food(turns to it and kicks back as if poo in a litter box).

I'm not sure if I should blame Hartz for kitty's little piggy qualities, so to be generous, it must not taste objectionable since she readily eats them. I could mix it with the rest of her food - but I doubt it does anything for breath either. Ummm...the shapes are cute to me, but kitty probably doesn't care about that. Just wish she'd be chewing on a product that garnered a few teeth crunches so some abrasive action might occur!

review/summary: 7 Happy Cats Say it's Great
review/text: We have seven rescued cats, each of which has learned over the years how to enjoy the good life.  Whereas they would accept anything to eat following their rescue from the streets, they have reached that point, like most cats do, in which they will turn up their nose on treats unless they meet their "new high standards".  They really liked the Salmon Crunch 'n Clean.  We have found that giving our cats the harder, crunchy treats tends to greatly reduce the plaque buildup our cats used to get.  While the crunchy treats haven't eliminated periodic professional teeth cleaning, it has reduced them significantly which is both cost saving and beenficial to our cats.  I highly recommend the Hartz Crunch 'n Clean as a product that is tasty to our cats and works to reduce tartar and plaque build-up.

review/text: Both my cats love these treats and eagerly gobble them up -- the problem is that the cats eat so quickly that they don't actually chew the treats!  The treats are smaller than their kibble, which is a large triangle/pyramid shape of food, thus they are quite easy to swallow with little or no chewing.  Since the chewing and crunching is necessary, the cats aren't really benefiting from the dental effects.  But they do love the taste, so I'm happy to give this 4 stars.

Well needless to say this product fits the bill for her!  She LOVES them and will come from anywhere she might be reclining when she hears the shake of the bag.  A useful tool when it's time for cats to come in!  I don't know how much help the teeth cleaning part is, but she sure enjoys every bite of these morsels.

review/summary: Tasty, Crunchy Goodness for your Kitties
review/text: When we received these, I opened the package and instantly had several of our 5 cats standing at attention waiting to test out the newest smackeral. So it seems to be a very tasty little snack for the kitties with added dental benefits, which is nice if you've ever tried to brush a cats teeth.<br /><br />At our house, this package has to be kept up high in the cabinets where they can't get to them ... I think they smell through the package and tried to chew through to get to them. Now my ragged bag is hiding in the pantry and they all come running when they hear the sound of the zip lock open in anticipation of a yummy treat.

review/summary: Love at first bite!
review/text: My 17-year-old cat Toonces is VERY finicky, so I wasn't sure how she'd like these chicken-flavored treats.  I tried four in the palm of my hand and she ate them without batting a whisker.  To say she liked them would be understating the case. Now she waits rather impatiently for her twice-a-day treat.<br /><br />Crunch 'n Clean has vitamins and minerals plus taurine, an essential for feline health.  There's just 1.1 calorie per treat and Hartz's claim is a 75% reduction in tooth tarter.  No one likes to brush a kitty's teeth--at my home that would be a life-threatening action for me--why not let Crunch 'n Clean do the job for you.  In addition, your cat will love you for it.<br /><br />Definitely two paws up on this one.

review/summary: Well liked, but not sure of the dental benefits
review/text: I like the re-sealable bag and you do seem to get a lot of treats in a bag as compared to other brands, but the treat are smaller. Maybe it my imagination.  My 4 year old cats like these treats as much as any.  One is quite finicky and there are several treats she turns her nose up at, but she likes these a lot.  Liking them is fine and well, but my little pigs tend to eat them so fast, I don't think they chew them, thereby bypassing any dental benefits  So, I feed one treat at a time and actually hear them crunching.<br /><br />I read up on the ingredients and the corn doesn't thrill me, but I can't see anything in the ingredients to worry about.

review/text: Since my cat Hudson cannot yet write reviews, I'll do my best though I haven't personally tasted these treats.  Hudson LOVES these treats!  I am somewhat skeptical of the dental hygiene claims, but he really likes them, which is rare... he often turns his nose up at treats.  I'll definitely reorder these!

review/summary: Cat loves them!
review/text: We have trouble with our cat liking snacks for hairball treatment or for tartar control. This it liked when we first gave it to her. we gave it six and shut the bag and put it on the counter. The cat got on the counter and stood at the bag wanting more. That says a lot for our cat. Every cat is different so what's good for one cat might be terrible tasting for another one. Haven't had time to tell if it helps with it's teeth yet I'll post something later on that.

review/summary: Cat loves these!
review/text: I have a very finicky eater, especially when it comes to treats (unless, of course, it's from my plate). Luckily, she loves these, and I have to fight her when I'm opening the pouch to give her more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, she wolfs these down with barely a crunch or two, so I don't think I'll see much benefit to her dental health. I'd like the treats to be a bit larger to force her to chew them.

review/summary: My finicky Persian ate them right up.
review/text: I ordered both salmon (usually my cat's favorite flavor) and beef (she usually doesn't care for beef flavoring, in fact has digestion troubles with it sometimes).  The first I tried was Salmon flavored:  I felt very sure that my slim, persnickety, Persian diva would leave these where they lay; for sure when they were delivered right after I served her a fresh serving of Friskies canned Salmon shreds.  Now, to serve her a daily dose of powdered medication, I have to mix a small amount of the powder with moist, canned food; which is why I even give her moist food.  She would smell or taste the medicine and not touch it if it wasn't mixed right, and she would eat right around it.  So, for her to eat these, I was quite pleased.  They are small, about the size of a piece of puffed wheat; and very hard and crunchy; I can hear her crunching from ten feet away.<br /><br />The ingredients list corn flour, chcken meal, wheat flour and corn gluten meal as the first of many listed. The label say's "with nutritious vitamins & minerals plus the essential amino acid taurine" and "under 2 calories per treat".  The calorie count at the bottom notes 1.1 calorie per treat.  Label advertises that the product "removes 3 times more tartar than regular cat treats", and includes an ingredient called Denta Shield, which supposedly creates a shield to prohibit further tartar build up.  The consumer has no way of verifying this of course, but I will assume that if this is even half true, and she is getting half the vitamins, it is better than nothing.  If she won't eat it, it won't do her any good.<br /><br />Now, the second time I fed her today, I offered her three more treats, and she declined to eat them, so appetite appears to have some affect on her desire to eat them.

review/summary: Cat loves them but the "crunch" is not guarenteed.
review/text: Sasha (my calico) seems to love the taste but she just swallows the treats whole without chewing. That sorta defeats the purpose of the tarter control. Perhaps if the treats were bigger cats would have to chew them.<br /><br />Needless to say, this won't replace the annual teeth cleanings or improve her breath. :)

review/text: These treats went over big with two cats, both of whom are finicky eaters and aren't usually into cat snacks.  This is good news for them and for my wallet.  Hopefully these snacks do what they claim, keep kitty's teeth clean which will cut down on professional cleanings. Only time will tell.

review/summary: 5 out of 6 cats enjoyed this product
review/text: Gave these to a total of 6 cats and all but one quickly devoured the pieces up, awaiting for more.  The one that shunned the treat was not particularly a picky-eater either so I'm not sure what the deal was about. They are in a nice package size to provide decent amount of treats yet not too big where they might get stale if sitting too long opened.

review/summary: A real treat for my cats
review/text: Believe it or not my cats are picky when it comes to treats.  Well they love these and come running when I shake the jar I store them in.  These treats are hard and the cat has to chew it.  This means that they really do clean the cat's teeth.  There's also a chemical used in Crest toothpaste the helps prevent plaque and tartar build up.  My vet wanted over $800 to clean my cat's teeth.  I can buy a lifetime supply of these snacks for that price and my cats will be happier.  To be completely honest, I tasted one to see if it tasted like salmon.  It didn't but I had to give it a try.

review/summary: Cattie likey
review/text: I wish I could say I had a very discriminating cat like some, but my Tomcat (no, I did not choose the name) falls into the try-to-stay-out-of-the-way category. He was very pleased with his first handful and just as pleased with his second. He's waiting patiently for his third. I like to hear him crunch, crunch, crunch because I'm envisioning cleaner teeth and breath, but don't have any proof to report yet. He generally has fairly heinous breath, so here's hopin'!

review/summary: I Wish Cats Could Read...
review/text: ...Then they would read the information on the package and know how good it was for them, and perhaps take a liking to it. Of my 3 cats, none of them enjoy "Crunch `n Clean." I have tried 3 flavors: Rich Salmon, Bold Beef, and Savory Chicken, because the benefits of tartar control and "Denta Shield" are mighty appealing to the human house mate who pays the veterinarian bills (anyone who has had an estimate for feline dental work from a pet clinic knows what I mean). Tooth decay in cats is a big problem, and this product, from the information given, seems as though it would help.<br /><br />Is it the smell? The shape? What is missing here? They get all excited when they see the package, and are terribly disappointed when the likes of Purina's "Whisker Lickin's" or Whiskas' "Temptations" (the 2 snack treats they occasionally get) doesn't emerge from the little bag. The best I can do at this point is mix "Crunch `n Clean" with their regular dry food, in hopes that they'll accidentally eat some. Without that subterfuge, there's no dice with "Crunch `n Clean," just upturned noses.<br /><br />I'll give Hartz 3 stars for trying, but suggest they do some more taste testing. No matter what the product, usually at least 1 of my cats will dive in and enjoy, so "Crunch 'n Clean" must be lacking in the "appetizing factor" in a big way.  Back to the drawing board Hartz!

review/summary: Meow, meow! Give it to me now!!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:23 Mins<br /><br /></span>Cat treats fall into two categories at my house. "I will not eat that" or "Gimme, gimme, gimme!"  Happily, these fall into the "Gimme, gimmie, gimmie" category. Kitty is not a picky eater. About 90% of the treats we've tried with her are gobbled down shortly before she begs for more. These were no exception.<br />As for the tarter control aspect of the treats, I really couldn't say that they work either way. Perhaps some people have an intimate enough relationship with their cats to be able to tell if a specific treat is reducing tarter or otherwise protecting their teeth, I'm not one of those people. But, the worse case scenario is that her teeth are in the same condition before the treats as they are after, as I would be really surprised if they made her tarter problem worse, so I'll continue to feed her the tarter control treats. Maybe her teeth will be a little cleaner when she bites me in an attempt to convince me to give her more treats.

review/summary: Mr. Picky Cat eats them
review/text: My cat happily scarfed down some of these.<br /><br />These cat dental treats appear to be different than others.  DentaShield coats the the teeth to block tarter formation.<br /><br />The directions say to feed the cat 4-5 of these twice a day.  I'm guessing this little pouch to be about 2 weeks worth at that rate.<br /><br />Corn flour is the first ingredient, not really the best stuff for your cat but corn is often a major ingredient in catfood anyway.  As a treat, its probably okay, but these would be better labeled corn & chicken treats than salmon treats.  Having said that, the cat doesn't really appear to care (he can't read).  Appears to be a nutritional supplement as well as a dental treat.  Wish there was some way to know what the RDA of this stuff is for cats.<br /><br />The ingredients:  Corn flour, chicken meal, wheat flour, corn gluten meal, poultry fat, dehulled soybean meal, salmon meal, sodium hexametaphosphate, poultry digest [what is that??], dried brewers yeast, calcium carbonate, potassium chloride, salt, choline, chloride, lecithen, vitamin E supplement, niacin supplement, vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, vitamin B12 supplement, riboflavin supplement, biotin, thiamin mononitrate, folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, vitamin D3 supplement, menodione sodium bisulfite complex, ferrus sulfate, zinc oxide, manganese oxide, copper sulfate, cobalt carbonate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide, sodium selenite, mineral oil, dl-methionine, taurine, color added (titanium dioxide, yellow #6, blue #1), BHA (a preservative), mixed tocopherols (a preservative).<br /><br />Guaranteed analysis:<br />Crude Protein min: 25%<br />Crude Fat min: 8%<br />Crude Fiber max: 4%<br />Moisture max: 10%<br />Vitamin A 2,273 IU/lb<br />Vitamin E 14 IU/lb<br />Zinc 75 mg/kg<br />Selenium .1 mg/kg<br />Taurine. .1%<br /><br />Calorie Count 1.1 per treat

review/text: I fed some of these treats to both cats.  Three isn't that picky but chose these over his dry food.<br /><br />So I tried it with Cassie, the one who will only eat a partial can of wet and then want another flavor.  I was totally surprised that she scarfed down the first one and wanted more!<br /><br />I am concerned about my cats dental health and I was thrilled when Cassie ate these.  And they both liked them which is an even bigger plus!<br /><br />They look like little cat paws and smell pretty much like dry cat food.<br /><br />I'm thrilled with this product and will be buying more.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />MEF

review/summary: Not for picky eaters
review/text: The treats come in 3 sizes/shapes.  The heart is the smallest.  The Chicken is middle sized.  The pig is the largest.  I've never seen a cat attack a pig.<br /><br />The green center also increases in size with the shape.<br /><br />I have 2 cats.  One who will eat anything. Catfood, chips, pieces of fruit.  And one that is a picky eater, and turns down most people food.<br /><br />Needless to say, my omnivore cat loved them!  Ate the reccomended amount and wanted more.<br /><br />Now my picky eater, he would eat the hearts.  He would put the pig in his mouth and spit it right out.  He tried again to eat the pig, spit it out again and gave me a dirty look.  The third day I tried the chickens.  He would eat exactly 2 chickens, and then start spitting them out.  The following day I tried the pigs again.  He instantly spit it out and walked away.  The 5th day I tried the hearts again and he will now just lick at the outside instead of eating it, unless I trick him with a whiskas treat first.<br /><br />My conclusion is the green center must taste pretty bad and should have an outside tasty shell for picky eaters.  Or should all be in the small heart shape.  Why the different shapes?  My cat's not going to know or care that it is shaped like a pig.

review/text: My cats love these treats.  They are really hard so they have to chew them so hopefully they are cleaning their teeth.  My vet wanted $1,400 to clean my cat's teeth.  That's just not going to happen.  This is reasonable alternative that the cats enjoy.  BTW: My cats are picky when it comes to treats but they really like these.  If I can't find them, I shake the jar and they come within a few seconds.  They double as a cat caller.
