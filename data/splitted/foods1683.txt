review/summary: Happiness in a mug
review/text: Do you know that feeling you get when something makes you really, really happy, so happy you can't stop smiling? I get this happiness overload when I smell honeysuckle, run through the grass barefoot or eat juicy peaches or chill crunchy apples - and while drinking Davidson's Herbal Christmas tea. The smell of this tea is lovely, but it does have a slightly overpowering cinnamon smell. When brewed, the mint in the tea balances out the cinnamon to create a hot/icy sensation in one's mouth. I brewed 1.5 tsp in a little over a cup of not-quite boiling water, and the flavor is beautifully subtle, not overpowering. This tea is surprisingly sweet, perfect by itself. I'm used to buying tea of this quality for about $12 for 2 oz, not 1lb. The double-layer bag was bigger than I expected, with a ziplock like closure at the top to keep the tea fresh. Over all, I think this was one of the best purchases I've ever made.

review/summary: Wish i could give it more stars!
review/text: I was surprised when i've opened the bag, such a powerful aroma. And its taste is even better...Be sure you like cinnamon and cloves, because the aroma is quite powerful. But it's balanced by the mint and the orange peels and this is what makes this tea so good. It doesn't even needs sugar, because it's kind of sweet by itself.<br /><br />The price is very good, considering the quality and how much you get for the price. Even the bag is quality made, aluminium inside and air tight sealed; it also has a plastic zipper, so you can reseal the bag every time (though i don't think it will be completely air tight, as it's when you first open the bag).

review/summary: Must like cinnamon!
review/text: You must like cinnamon to drink this tea! Not necessarily overpowering, but pretty strong. I personally like the mix of citrus, cinnamon, and roobios, also the clove adds a bit of a spicy note to this mix. I'm having to eliminate caffeine and this tea has definitely made my life easier, sometimes I add some chamomile, but most of the time I brew it strong. It can get bitter if left to steep too long due to the citrus peels, but with a little practice you can get it just right for your taste.

review/text: When I first tried this tea I was disappointed because I was hoping it would taste like Good Earth's Original tea without the caffeine.  But after having several cups I have to say its actually pretty good. Its not like regular tea, its an acquired taste, its subtle and quite pleasant once you get used to it.

review/summary: Outstanding taste
review/text: Since moving to the US from England, there are a couple of food items that I truly miss..  one of those is good English Cheddar Cheese.  I have tried many cheddars from the supermarkets but nothing comes close since I prefer a sharp taste.  Some cheeses are supposedly English but you find they are made in the US.<br /><br />Recently I ordered this particular cheese from igourmet (their website is exceptional btw). The items are shipped in special containers with ice packs to keep the temperature low.  This particular cheese is covered in some food wax so when you peal it aware, you receive a very fresh looking cheese.  The taste of this cheese is outstanding and a very nice sharp cheddar.  Highly recommended.

review/summary: A fantastic Cheddar!
review/text: The epitome of an English Farmhouse Cheddar, the Dorset Drum is tangy and sharp with a wonderful buttery finish. Slightly crumbly, it was fantastic on a cheese plate with fresh fruit and crackers or melted into mashed potatoes with bacon. It also made a great grilled cheese on a sliced crusty loaf. I could definitely give this cheese as a gift as it comes boxed and ready to present in a gift basket with some accessories such as a cheese knife and cheese board and some crackers. This cheese is sent exactly as pictured, dipped in a thick black wax which comes away easily and packaged in the Dorset Drum decorative box and iGourmet ships in an insulated bag with gel packs so the cheese arrives in perfect condition. I was very pleased with this purchase and would definitely buy this again.

It's fun to try food from other cultures and I recommend this... especially good after nuking one piece for 9 seconds ... makes it extra buttery !

review/summary: Great for your hair - You should try it now and thank me later.
review/text: Great for your hair.<br /><br />I've been worried about losing hair - after each shower, I found tons of hair on the show stall floor. That really scared me. A friend recommended something call Fo-Ti to me, and I googled it.<br /><br />After reading this interesting story of HE Sho Wu, a Chinese man who used to be very impotent and could not have a child until after he's over 50 when he came across this Fo-Ti. He started to have it for a few years and on the second year he became a very healthy man and was very potent, having 7 children and lived a life of 150 years. Well that's the story about Fo-Ti, or He Sho Wu, the Chinese herb name which is named after this man who discovered the herb.<br /><br />So Fo-Ti coupled with black sesame makes wonder. Both are good for making your hair look great. If you started to see a few grey hair like me, try this cereal now and you'll notice the difference in your hair. After trying it for two weeks in a row, I noticed that I did not lose that much hair after shower and I started to see less grey hair to my surprise. Now it's part of my breakfast.

review/summary: Best natural pain relief out there for severe menstrual cramps
review/text: I'm a 24 year old, otherwise healthy & fit woman who has always suffered from severe menstrual cramps. Every month, I used to take LOADS of ibuprofen and pamprin for 3-4 days at a time so that I could function and go to work. I saw this in a health foods store and tried it, because I was desperate and it's cheap! I thought the benefits would be as a placebo, or the psychological comfort of drinking something warm when you're in pain. I was mistaken. I feel it actually does a great job of preparing my uturus for "that time" and keeping it relaxed and efficient when the time comes---meaning a lot of effective, natural pain relief.<br /><br />How I use it: I start drinking 2-3 cups of tea per day beginning 3-5 days before my period starts, and then even more if I start cramping. The first day or two of my period, I might have 5-6 cups of tea. This tea TASTES GREAT (not medicine-like at all) and you really can't overdo it. I've been able to wean myself off the ibuprofen to where I'm not taking more than the labeled ibuprofen dosage (about 1/4 of what I was using before). I don't suffer from prementrual symptoms (just agony during menstruation) but I have girlfriends who do and they swear this stuff works for that as well. Amazon has the best price anywhere. Do yourself a favor and try this at least once. If you're a MAN reading this (I know, what are the odds): buy it for your significant other! She'll thank you for life (or until menopause)!

review/text: OMG...this has got to be the most awesome PB ever created.  god bless you Lee Zelben for your innovative and creative mind.  it is so delicious, creamy, and smooth.  i can't even keep a jar around anymore because honestly i can eat the whole jar in one sitting with only a spoon.  i have only eaten it plain out of the jar but i am sure it would be good on a variety of items i.e. graham crackers, pretzels, wasa crackers.  i have been to the actual restaurant in NYC.  we made a special trip while on a visit.  the sandwiches were pricey but delish...if i lived near a store that carried this i would buy it in bulk and stockpile it in my basement.  it is probably best for my own "safety" and the safety of others that the closet store is a 50 minute drive away.  i love that it is vegan (although i am not-just a flexatarian) and that it is actually less in calories than regualr JIF, etc.  i use PB as a protein source on days when i have not had enough.  it says on the container that some oil separation may occur but i have not had that EVER happen with any jars from this company.  it also does not need to be refrigerated like other natural peanut butters.  cold peanut butter...boo!  OH, and don't forget to recycle the container when you are finished.

review/summary: The Best Peanut Butter Ever
review/text: I've tried quite a few different varieties of peanut butter, and this is unequivocally the best of the lot.  It's so good, you don't even need anything to spread it onto; just eat it from the jar!  Of course, that's because of its white chocolate flavor; if you're wanting just plain peanut taste, then this isn't a good choice.  It's about the consistency of Peter Pan peanut butter (I'd prefer something more like Maranatha's peanut butter, but this is good enough), but it's sooo much better, and they use palm oil so there's no need for partial hydrogenation (which is good).<br /><br />Anyway, just buy it.  Amazon has a great price, too.

This product is also very low on ingredients and not nearly as highly processed as most of the brands out there.

review/summary: This is great INSTANT oatmeal
review/text: I discovered BetterOats oatmeal at a local store.  I have never eaten instant oatmeal as it never appealled to me.  I am having problems with my teeth and it is difficult for me to chew.  So I figured I would get some.  Wow it was so good and so easy to fix.  So I immediately popped onto Amazon (as I order many things from them) and was delighted they carried the product.  However, what a shock I had when I saw what they were charging.  It looks as though they come from other places but the cost per box is ridiculous.  I am paying 50 cents per box, or 2/$1.00. at Save-A-Lot.  Now this place doesn't carry a huge variety so I checked out Food Lion and Giant which carried each box (5 packets in each) for $1.49.<br /><br />I felt I should let customers know about this pricing on Amazon.  Perhaps Amazon will read this review and might consider selling them themselves and put in a price between 50 cents to $1.49 with Free Shipping and maybe the "subscribe and save" option. I checked around Amazon and found prices to really vary -------  for 3 boxes it varies from $4.13 to $7.49 a box, for 6 boxes $4.13.  And I am paying 50 cents to $1.49 a box.

review/summary: Instant Classic (Pun Intended)
review/text: As a creature of habit, I have eaten two packs of Quaker instant at work for the past seven years.  After trying three different flavors of Oat Revolution, I will never go back.  Three reasons why:<br /><br />1) Flavor.  Simply put, it tastes better than Quaker.  When I was buying Quaker I had to cut the Brown Sugar with a packet of plain.  I did not have to do it with this brand.  it was not overly sweet, just delicious.  I just took a look at their website and they have an absurd number of flavors, including a dark chocolate that I have not seen at the store.<br /><br />2)  Smart packaging.  This likely only applies to me, but because I ate breakfast at my work, I never made the same bowl of oatmeal twice. Sometimes, too much water, other times, too little.  The Oat Revolution packet is the measuring cup.  You fill the packet to the dotted line, and voila, perfect oatmeal every time.<br /><br />3) Nod to the planet.  They are conscious about environmentally-sensitive packaging.

He's got the right infusers, kettles and thermometers to brew everything down to the degree.  Put simply, my honey takes his tea seriously.  BUT, this does not mean that he doesn't want to just toss a teabag in a bottle water for the go.  So I searched something new out and found this tea.  He says that this is his second favorite tea to cold brew and can't see himself not buying this tea so long as it's around.  He's not exactly picky, but for him to say this is in his top 2 favorites, from my personal experience and perspective, is a big deal.  Enjoy this tea people!  And definitely try cold brewing it at least once.  I wasn't crazy about this tea in it's hot state.

review/text: I first had this tea in a restaurant in California and fell in love with it.  It has a wonderful flavor that does not require sugar.  It is very refreshing, not to mention the benefits.  I drink less soft drinks now because it quenches my thirst and gives me energy without the caffeine, sugar and the let down.  It is also full of wonderful anti oxidants.

review/text: I purchased these and once home ate them and experienced a severe gluten reaction.  On the bag in small print at the bottom it said they were manufactured in a facility with wheat and dairy.  The label also stated that routine testing occurs only to maintain gluten free label status.  Our bag tested positive for gluten which caused severe bleeding.<br /><br />Please be careful when buying this brand as the statement is for CYA and labeling purposes only.  That way they can charge more for the product.

review/text: The Mi-Del Royal Vanilla Cookies do not have a "cream center".  The center is a vanilla-flavored hard sugar disc.  The outside cookie is delicious but only after removing the sugar disc.  After receiving the first order, I contacted Amazon and complained that the cookies did not have the creamy center as stated in the cookie product description.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement but the second order was exactly the same as the first.  I contacted Mi-Del through their website email and asked if the cream center was supposed to be hard.  Mi-Del did not answer my question but sent a coupon for my next purchase.

My family likes it as a crust for chocolate pie, but I've used them with others also and it turns out great.  I've never used them for baking pies so I can't recommend that, only for no-bake pies, cheesecakes, etc.

review/text: These are some of the best mass-produced gluten-free cookies I have found.  (Never mind the gluten-free part -- most people could never tell that these ginger snaps are not made with wheat flour.)  They've got great snap and just the right amount of gingery heat.  When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.  The box itself showed no signs of damage, so I'm a bit puzzled as to what transpired in the Amazon warehouse or in transit.  All in all, however, I love the cookies and am pleased with the Amazon price.  I'll be ordering these again.

review/summary: Ginger snaps are okay but I've had better.
review/text: I am a huge fan of ginger snaps. When recently diagnosed as needing to be gluten-free, and recently pregnant, I've been on the hunt for GF ginger snaps. I've tried three:<br /><br />Mi-Del Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br />Annie's Homegrown Ginger Snap Gluten Free Bunny Cookies<br />Mary's Gone Crackers Love Cookies Gluten Free Ginger Snaps<br /><br />1. Mi-Del<br />Texture: a bit grainy. Crunchy, but crumbles in the mouth in that gluten-free grainy way that is not my favorite texture<br />Ginger flavor: middling, a tiny bit spicy on the tongue but not too much<br />Sweetness: sweet, like you'd expect a cookie to be<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick<br />Density: the most heavy or dense of the three<br />Overall 2 or 3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />2. Annie's<br />Texture: a bit grainy, but less so than Mi-Del. Very crunchy. Little goldfish-sized crackers perfect for kids or snacking.<br />Ginger flavor: the most mild of the three, has that gingery hint to it, but not enough where it is spicy or leaves a tingle on the tongue<br />Sweetness: mild, less sweet than Mi-Del. More like eating an animal cracker than cookie. Tastes great with a slice of cheese.<br />Size: about 1/2 inch to 3/4 inch, and very thin<br />Density: light<br />Overall 4 out of 5 stars. If you wanted a kid-friendly cracker-like snack, this would be 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />3. Mary's<br />Texture: VERY crunchy, not at all grainy. Texture was the least "gluten-free" like of the three. Felt like I was eating a regular cookie.<br />Ginger flavor: very spicy. I could only eat two or three crackers before my tongue needed a break (but I'm not big on spicy foods in general so consider me on the sensitive side). I actually prefer a ginger cookie to be like this though. Plus, it killed my pregnancy nausea in minutes - bonus.<br />Sweetness: not as sweet as Mi-Del, but not as mild as Annie's. very pleasant to me.<br />Size: about 2 inches, and about 1/4 inch thick, basically the same as Mi-Del.<br />Density: Ultra light, most airy in the center<br />Overall 5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />Everyone's tastebuds are different, but these were my perceptions. I personally want a ginger cookie with a good "bite" to it, and I really can't stand gluten-free products that are grainy in texture (which seems to be most of them). I want the texture to act like a regular gluten item.  For me, Mary's fit the bill exactly, and Annie's was a close second. Annie's was so different though, I'd eat Mary's as a cookie, and Annie's as a snack, so I could see having them both in the pantry.<br /><br />The one I still want to try is Pamela's, because it has great Amazon reviews. I just don't want to buy them in bulk until I try them, so I need to find them locally.

The taste is barely noticeable and then all of a sudden there is an odd chemical frosting taste. *sigh* I will continue searching for a gluten free cookie, but have resigned myself to the fact that I will have to cook most everything from scratch from now on. On the bright side, it will certainly make me plan ahead better and a more inventive cook.

review/summary: Meh.
review/text: These are my least favorite of Mi-Del's gluten-free lineup -- which is sad, because I love chocolate and caramel and had high hopes.  However, these cookies are hard and dry.  I'd compare them to biscotti, but that would be unfair to biscotti because these have neither the delightfully craggy texture nor the depth of flavor that good biscotti do.  The "chocolate" part of the equation comes not from true chocolate, but from cocoa, which makes the flavor dull and flat.  The caramel flavor is not awful, but it's marred by the hard-candy-like texture of the caramel bits.  And when Mi-Del describes these as "bite-size," they mean it:  These cookies are approximately the size of a nickel in diameter.<br /><br />If I were to do it all over again, I'd find a bag of these in a local store and try them first.  As it stands now, I'm stuck with a case of the lil' suckers.

(I AM THE ONLY ONE WITH CELIAC DISEASE IN THE OFFICE)  SO WHEN I COULD NO LONGER EAT THE COOKIES, THE OFFICE ATE ALL MY COOKIES!  THEY WANTED MORE.  I DIRECTED THEM TO AMAZON.COM.  THE LADIES IN THE OFFICE HAD NO IDEA, GLUTEN FREE COOKIES TASTED SO GOOD.  THEY HAVE ALSO EATEN MY CHOCOLATE CHIP, GINGERSNAPS, SHORTBREAD COOKIES TOO.  SO THESE COOKIES APPEAL TO EVERYONE!

review/summary: Gluten free, really? They taste AMAZING!!
review/text: Finding gluten free products that taste decent is a challenge and I bought a box of these cookies expecting them to taste "good" but still, with an off taste from being gluten free. Wow, was I wrong! These cookies are amazing!! They are shaped like animals, light, crunchy, buttery, and a hint of lemon. These are hands down the best cookies I've had in my life, including "regular" cookies, and this is the first time I can actually say a gluten free item tastes better than its gluten counterpart.<br /><br />My WalMart sells these for 3.38/bag and I got them here for a bit over 2.00/bag with subscribe and save. This will definitely be a staple in our household! We've eaten an entire bag in less than 24 hours. Nobody could ever guess that these cookies are gluten free, they are AMAZING!!

review/summary: Sometimes, they will gluten you.
review/text: I love this company and what they are trying to do.  However, when I first got my celiac diagnosis, though, I got glutened by these.<br /><br />A couple of years passed.  The buzz on the celiac boards was that Mi-Del had really cleaned up their act, and that their cookies were safe.  From about 2004-2009, I ate these without incident.  I even figured out how to make cookie pie crusts in them and put the recipe in my gluten-free cookbook.  Then, I got a bad batch two times in a row, and got glutened again.<br /><br />Maybe they have problems with suppliers?  I understand they've been a lot more careful with the actual manufacturing process.<br /><br />It's sad, but I would buy Pamela's ginger cookies (available on Amazon!) instead.

review/text: We love these cookies, better than "K" vanilla.  My husband is not gluten free, and this is his favorite cookie too.  Yes, they are a crisp cookie (some may call hard), but that is why I like them.  They have a rich vanilla flavor which the "K" cookies do not. I carry these in my purse when when we are dining out so I have a gluten free dessert, restaurants never mind this.  For chocolate, we still like the "K" chocolate the best. Note: I use the auto delivery every 6 month for a better price.

review/text: To date, this is the only gluten free cookie I've tried and absolutely loved.  They have a livelier flavor than vanilla wafers and are sweeter (but not too sweet) than what you expect from regular animal crackers.  I subscribed to these and am glad they come in the bulk quantity they do, since even my gluten-loving coworkers devour them as soon as they see they're out for taking.

Our entire family loves them, but the real test is on unsuspecting gluten consuming individuals and they past the test. Recently the contractor came by in the afternoon with his son's 8 and 10 years old.  They looked hungry and so I offered cookies, with Dad's permission.  They almost wiped out the bag. Good Cookies!

review/text: These cookies are a wonderful replacement for any kid ( or grown up ) wanting to eat a long time favorite. There is about 80 cookies per bag, so it makes it well worth the money spent. They are light, buttery and crispy making them great for milk. These pack well in bags for lunch  ( don't break up easily ) so they would do great in a kid's lunch for school or daycare. I actually give these cookies to people to show them gluten free doesn't mean cardboard.
