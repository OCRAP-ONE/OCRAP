review/text: Great salt! Though now that I know how great it is I will have to buy a bigger bag next time. Mixed with some epsom salt and essential oils this makes a great bath salt. Ground up a bit finer it is wonderful for cooking. Will certainly buy again.

review/summary: Great taste!
review/text: This salt is so tasty!  It tastes nothing like the iodized table salt.  This has a light, mild taste that greatly enhances meats, vegetables, etc.  It's pink/peach color also looks very pretty in my clear Cole/Mason grinder.  It grinds very finely with no issue.  In fact, this salt grinds so finely that it leaves a fine coating, almost like a powder, around the inside of the clear grinder.  If you're a neat freak, this might bug you a little and you might find yourself wiping out the top of the grinder.  Great salt and the bag lasts a long time.

review/text: Just like in the store for a fraction of the price. I purchased this to refill my expensive pink salt grinder. A million times better than table salt. I don't know if it tastes any different from regular table salt but I think there is something about the shape of the crystals that changes the way the salt hits your tongue. If you have a good grinder I highly recommend checking this stuff out.

review/text: The bag was smaller than I expected, but that's probably just me being bad at estimating things.  The salt seems good, however, I was a little disappointed that the photo showed the salt to be much more vibrantly colored than they actually are.  I mean, they are pink, just not so bright pink as it shows.  The salt has a good flavor though.  I'd say it was worth the price.

review/summary: Difficult packaging
review/text: Salt tastes fine, cant say about the health claims. 3 stars is because of the packaging. The grinder top is too large for a comfortable grind. I have fairly large/strong hands and have a hard time turning the grinder. For me, when the grinder is mostly vertical to 45deg, it is difficult/impossible to grind directly onto food. Works fine if cap is left on & held in a horizontal position & them remove cap & use. The grind gives a nice fine grind (better than my OXO I also got at Amazon).

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/text: The only reason this product got a 1 star is I can't give it a 0! The picture and product info lead me to believe I will be getting a plant, I received a seed, one seed and it did not grow. I do read the reviews, and then tend to temper my decisions based on whether or not I am willing to take the risk. However, when  see 1 review I think okay maybe a bad purchase. I chose to make my decision and purchased the "magic can". Shame on me, I have now decided to add my review in the hopes that the next buyer will save themselves some headache. The item has not produced a plant of any kind,and I have waited almost a month now. The growing medium is nothing I have ever seen before, sparkles and fluff, and one little seed inside the can. The whole experience was a dud.

review/text: The picture and description of this item is for a pepper plant, or at least I construed it to be that way. What you get is a small can full of dirt with A pepper seed inside, not a living plant. If you're expecting to receive a pepper plant, as I did, you will be disappointed. $12 bucks for one (1) seed is a bit on the high side. Just thought I might prevent some other Buyer from making the same mistake that I did. Plus, it is no longer judged to be the hottest pepper in the world. The Moruga Scorpion now takes that honor.

review/summary: Good enough for me!
review/text: I recently moved to California and I have yet to find any place that serves anything close to Cincinnati/Greek style chili. I am super impressed with this stuff.<br /><br />If you normally avoid canned food, I wouldn't worry here.  Skyline lends itself well to being canned because it's usually slowly cooked over a long period of time anyway, the meat is ground very fine and the overall consistency is very smooth. Honestly, I can't really tell the difference from the "real thing" in the restaurants; I don't think it's missing anything.  In fact, I'm not sure why anyone even buys it frozen from Cincinnati-area grocers. In this case, canned is so much easier to prepare; crack it open and throw it on the stove (preferably in a cooking vessel, such as a pot), heats up very quickly. I save fridge space and energy. Done.<br /><br />Also, some pointers: one can tends to be enough for me and my wife. I'd say one 10.5 oz. can is about 3 small or 2 regular size n-ways, maybe a little bit more (Skyline folks will know what I mean :-). I like a 5-way, so I add a handful of canned red beans and chopped onions to the spaghetti just before pouring the chili over. Mound your mild cheddar over that and it is the real deal.<br /><br />The price is quite reasonable on Amazon and I can get my Skyline fix every once in a while. If you are missing Cincinnati style chili, I think you'll be pleased.

review/text: I experienced Skyline Chili for the first time about 10 years ago when visiting southeastern Indiana.  Love it.<br /><br />I keep a few cans in my pantry for those times I get a craving.  The canned version is ok.  Now if I can just find out where I can order the cheese that is shredded as finely as they do at the restaurant.<br /><br />Note that there are different sized cans of Skyline.  This one is only 10.5 ounces.  There are larger ones out there if you want those instead.<br /><br />I have found that if I cook it slowly up to a boil...as opposed to microwaving or cooking it FAST... it is not watery (as some of the other reviewers have commented).  The longer you cook it, the less watery it is.

review/summary: Uh oh, uh.... Weird?!
review/text: I started to drink this last week in addition to my regular water intake and other fluid intake.  After 24 hours I started to develop weird white pussy sores on the inside of my mouth, underneath my tongue.  Yea, nasty.  I stopped drinking this and after 4-5 days they cleared up.  I called my doctor and he said that was weird, that it should not be the tea.  So, I tried it again.  Those sores came right back.  Maybe it is my body "detoxifying" itself?  I have taken a lot of the ingredients in this tea in other teas before, so I am not sure that it is an allergic reaction.  I am questioning the quality of the tea at this point.<br /><br />  Such a weird thing.

review/summary: Good Coconut Water
review/text: I wanted to review this because reading some of the other reviews before I ordered had made me a bit uncertain, but when it went on sale I went for it and I'm very happy I did. My brother who never liked coconut water before tried it and wasn't converted, but my girlfriend and I who do like it in general really liked samu.<br /><br />Overlooking the really zealous reviews, some reviewers stated it was really sweet, but the nutrition label in the images showed it has half the sugar of a soda, so I figured it must just be personal preference and ordered anyway. After trying it, I really can't understand why someone said it hurt their teeth, but I guess people are different. I rather liked the little sweetness.<br /><br />I drink it straight or blended with ice and lime juice. We also tried like the other reviewer said and mixed one up with some vanilla vodka and I have to say it was actually very nice. I don't think they sell this in stores yet? but I plan to get more from Amazon.

review/summary: An alternative mixer and soda substitute
review/text: A lot is being made of the sugar content here, and it's quite overblown. This coconut water has a fraction of the sugar of a can of soda, so to say it hurts your teeth is dishonest at best. Neither is the sugar content a big secret: the ingredients are plainly listed in the product photos. If you want a no-sugar added product, look elsewhere. That market is crowded enough to meet your needs.<br /><br />So why opt for Samu? If you can't kick the sugary drinks but want to cut back, this is a great soda substitute. It's very smooth and drinkable.<br /><br />But the reason I bought it - what this company is really advertising this product for - is as a mixer. This mixed very well with rum. Instead of a rum and coke, try a rum and Samu! Tequila makes for an interesting mix. Ordinarily you'd pair sour with tequila, not sweet, but give it a try. It's pretty good! I'm not a vodka drinker, but my friends had good things to say.<br /><br />This is not a typical mixer you would see at a party. It gets people talking. I look forward to experimenting more with it.

review/summary: A DIFFERENT Kind of Coconut Water
review/text: I love coconut water, but every time I try it in the States, there seems to be something missing. I have tried several other brands side by side, and there always seems to be something missing (or they taste like wet socks).<br /><br />SAMU is the only brand I have ever had that seems to embody the refreshing and smooth taste of coconut water brought directly from the plantation. It actually reminds me of drinking coconut water directly from the coconut at a Thai beach resort like Koh Samui - clean, refreshing, and invigorating.<br /><br />The tiniest bit of sweetness sets it so clearly above all other brands, I don't know how I could ever go back to drinking any other coconut water.<br /><br />The other thing I really like about SAMU is the fact it is in an aluminum can. Alot of other coconut waters you will see are in those cardboard-laminate boxes, which are next to impossible to recycle. By putting SAMU in a can, it not only has a familiar hand-feel, but I know I can easily recycle the can as well.<br /><br />Overall, I rate it 5 stars: an excellent product and well worth the money. I highly recommend it.

review/text: So it seems like no one's getting the point of this, or maybe I'm completely wrong, but this product seems like it's supposed to be mixed (they suggest whiskey, vodka, or rum, as well as a tequila chaser). I mean, just look at it, the design is obviously not a health and fitness drink like the other brands. It looks like a beer can. It's awesome, mix it and you'll know what I'm talking about. It's a party drink, plain and simple, and all my friends loved it! Thanks for shaking things up in what's usually a boring line up of mixers.

review/summary: Good coconut water, but different from the test
review/text: I'm a pretty big fan of coconut water. I've had Amy & Brians, Taste Nirvana, VitaCoco, Zico and lots of other brands. In general I like most brands and tend to prefer it from a can and without any added flavors (like lime or pineapple).<br /><br />I found Samu to be delicious with the flavor and quality of the water being very good. As mentioned in some reviews, there is a caveat: Samu has added sugar. Looking into it, it's only a teaspoon (coconut water naturally has sugar and calories already). If this is okay with you, I recommend trying this.

review/summary: Love This as a Mixer
review/text: As juice, I will always prefer fresh coconuts over any bottled alternatives, but I think you can never fairly compare any bottled coconut water to the fresh kind because the pasteurization process changes the taste. So I will rate this as a bottled coconut juice and mixer.<br /><br />Samu has a creamy, marshmallowy taste, which is delicious, but it gets a little intense for me if I'm drinking it on its own. Still, I definitely like Samu much more than other brands I've tried. Thai coconuts are really the best.<br /><br />As a mixer, I love it! I really wasn't convinced by their marketing, but my friend talked me into trying it with vodka, whiskey, and rum. I went into it convinced I wouldn't like it, but I was pleasantly surprised. The creamy taste and sweetness mix really well with alcohol.<br /><br />The only one I wasn't completely sold on was whiskey, but I used bourbon, so it may taste better with scotch. It didn't taste terrible, but it wasn't exactly delightful either.<br /><br />With rum it's pretty good. It gives a smooth finish, but I do find that alone,it doesn't blend as well with rum's initial strong taste as lime and pineapple juice do, so I tried half Samu, half pineapple juice, and it was perfect.<br /><br />Vodka was my favorite. Samu manages to mask the alcoholic taste completely. There was a little hint of bitterness, but the mixed drink smelled and tasted almost 100% like coconut juice, with a really smooth, sweet finish.<br /><br />I think vodka samu will be my casual mixed drink from now on whenever I want something more refreshing and healthy than my usual whiskey ginger.

review/summary: Tasty, a little sweet
review/text: Coconut water is often a little too salty for me, but this one is sweetened enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. Even so, I've found that it's better with food or it can get too sweet by the end of the can. It was better with slightly spicy food (had it with Mexican food) than with, say, a grilled steak. Overall, a very good drink. I hope it'll get re-stocked soon!

review/text: BEWARE!! CONTAINS ADDED SUGAR--LOTS OF IT!! I was surprised when I checked the ingredient list on the cans when they arrived to see that sugar is added. Many of the reviews mentioned the sweetness of the coconut water without mentioning the sugar addition, which makes me wonder if the positive reviews were generated by Samu people. The page for this product makes no mention of the actual ingredients; similarly their web site has no ingredient listing. I thought this meant the coconut water was just that, coconut water. The taste is, yes, sweet--so sweet my teeth hurt from drinking the beverage! This is just soda pop masquerading as coconut water. Not for me--I've dumped the contents of all the cans down the sink.

review/summary: Samu Coconut Water is the best tasting cocnut water available in the US
review/text: My brother accidentally shipped a box of Samu Thai Coconut Water to our house instead of shipping it to himself.  Everyone in my family drinks a lot of water and we usually don't keep juices or sodas around the house but Samu Coconut Water has been a hit.  It is refreshing and not too sweet...perhaps slightly sweeter than Vitamin Water which has roughly 13g of sugar whereas, Samu has 19g of sugar. It's been great straight out of the can or we've experimented using it as a mixer for our cocktails.  I will definitely order more Samu to keep around as a cool and refreshing summer drink.  I've also had success in cooking with it.  I've substituted or cut some of the coconut milk in recipe with Samu coconut water -- this has helped me maintain the coconut flavor of the dish while cutting down some of the fat in coconut milk.

review/summary: Kobe Beef Is Avalable In the USA!!!!!
review/text: KOBE (AKA) Wagyu ('' Wagy'?, literally Japanese cow) refers to several breeds of cattle genetically predisposed to intense marbling and to producing a high percentage of oleaginous unsaturated fat. The meat from wagyu cattle is known worldwide for its marbling characteristics, increased eating quality through a naturally enhanced flavor, tenderness and juiciness, and a high market value. In several areas of Japan, beef is shipped with area names. Some examples are Kobe, Mishima, Matsusaka, 'mi, and Sanda beef. Highly prized for their rich flavor, these cattle produce arguably the finest beef in the world. These different breeds produce beef that range from expensive (by any measure) to extremely expensive (about US$ 50 per 150 grams of filet steak sold retail in Japan).[citation needed]<br /><br />Wagyu cattle's genetic predisposition yields a beef that contains a higher percentage of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids[1] than typical beef. The increased marbling also improves the ratio of monounsaturated fats to saturated fats.<br /><br />United States<br /><br />In the United States, Japanese Wagyu cattle were bred with Angus cattle to create a crossbred animal that would be more able to survive the U.S. climate and ranching methods. The meat of this crossbreed was more marketable to the typical American buyer, for whom the meat of the wagyu cow is "too white".[5] The meat of the crossbreed provides the balance of marbling and red meat desired by them. This crossbreed has been named American Style Kobe Beef.[6]<br /><br />Designed to mimic the diet that Japanese cattle were receiving, Wagyu cattle in the United States are fed a mixture of corn, alfalfa, barley and wheat straw.<br /><br />As of 2007, the U.S. cannot ship wagyu beef to Japan, as Japan requires that beef imported from the U.S. be from cattle not older than 20 months; U.S. Wagyu cattle are usually slaughtered at 30-35 months.[7]<br /><br />In Colorado Wagyu beef is being marketed by a ranch near Basalt, Colorado, and the Angus crossbred by a ranch near Rush, Colorado. Wagyu were first competitively exhibited at the National Western Stock Show in 2012.[

review/summary: Nice flavor, single serving, super easy to cook
review/text: While this isn't the best ever curry mix available, it IS pretty good. What makes it worth buying is the simplicity. You literally just boil the bag in a pot of water, cut it open and pour it over cooked rice (or noodles) and you're done. Instant curry dinner for one. (or two if you are just snacking) The box is marked "Hot" and it's got a decent level of spice or heat, but it's not hot by my standards, if you're looking for fire breathing hot curry, you'll want to add some spices of your own and do some doctoring here. But again, for a quick curry fix or snack, it'll work fine. There are some small carrots & potatoes in the packet already & they are ok, totally edible. I usually cook a small lamb chop or pork chop to add to the rice for a full meal after a busy day - makes a nice enough cold weather meal with a favorite movie type of thing.

Love this stuff. If you would rather use fresh veggies (even though the carrots and potatoes included in this packet are pretty good for pre-packaged veggies), you can simply purchase just the solid-type (bouillon) curry mix by S&B and it works the same. Then just throw in your own meat and veggies and it comes out just as good.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Perfect bite, perfect taste... if I had a gripe, I'd say that you have to cook it for one minute less than the recommended al dente time in order to get it properly al dente, but once you know that, you're golden.

Ultra Gel instantly thickens any liquid at any temperature so is good for making everything from instant pudding to Thanksgiving Gravy, and best of all products don't separate in the fridge or freezer and can be safely canned.  This makes it so that no only can I cut down my time in the kitchen I never have to give up quality and my leftovers stay good long enough that someone eats them!

review/summary: It's so good, I don't even want to tell you because I'm afraid the price will go up (law of supply and demand)
review/text: I'm making myself tell what I would prefer to keep secret:  Truly this is the best-quality,genuine article,cold-pressed (in small quantities)olive oil, made right here in the U.S.A. (California).  People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard.  Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago:  simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate!  This is not "snooty gourmets" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT.<br /><br />By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear:  true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product.<br /><br />Even Olive Oil can get complicated:  the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani.<br /><br />I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!<br /><br />YES IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THEIR REVIEWS.

review/summary: The Great Olive Oil Scandal and why you should use Bariani
review/text: The problem with most of today's olive oil is that it is rarely produced in the old way, which is more time consuming and expensive. Due to the increasing demand for olive oil, the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations. These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply, but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil.<br /><br />To reduce costs, olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs. Olives that have dropped on the ground, which can be said to contain bad oil, are often mixed with the good ones. They are shipped in all kinds of containers, many of which are poorly ventilated, and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy. The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil.<br /><br />Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process, thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil. Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process. Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away, factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months, whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years.<br /><br />Most people think that by purchasing "extra virgin" olive oil they are getting a high quality oil.  Unfortunately, in most cases, this is not true. It's more complex than that. A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality. For one thing, nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100% from olives.<br /><br />Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin. But now the oil has been refined, and that's not what you want. That's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil, which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value. To complicate matters even more, the term "extra virgin" has no official meaning in the United States. The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council. So, olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards.<br /><br />Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year, and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century. Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum, a Swiss-German magazine, and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade, and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful. Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap, highly-refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey. International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved. As much as 20% hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer. In fact olive oil labeled "Italian" often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece. Considering what has happened in Europe, where there are strict regulations, imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations. Apparently, more oil is "produced" in California than there are olives available. The truth is, most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil.<br /><br />The bottom line is that modem, factory-produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients, and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult.<br /><br />Bariani olive oil is produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California. Their olives are grown without pesticides.  They are hand picked from the trees, carefully washed and dried, and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting. It is pressed in a hydraulic press, collected in stainless steel vats, decanted, and bottled.  This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness.

I couldn't imagine cooking without it.

review/summary: A remakably mixed review
review/text: This olive oil adds a freshness to every dish that you're bound to notice.  It's true what the others are saying, this oil is different than most others.  When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat.  Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright.  But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle.  They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and "peppery notes" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives.  I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste.  Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO.  Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked.  My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Amazon.  The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying.

review/summary: For those concerned about bitterness...
review/text: I noticed that a number of reviewers commented on the "bitterness" of the Bariani extra virgin olive oil.  I tried out both their 2010 "early harvest" (green) olive oil and their regular fall 2010 olive oil.  I found their green olive oil to have a stronger, grassy (they mention the high chlorophyll content, which you do get!) flavor, with a distinct bitter edge and peppery finish.  This would be great for someone who gravitates toward a greener, bolder flavor and perhaps a more adventurous experience.  I found it too bitter for my pestos though it worked just fine with roasted chicken, and I think would be great for dipping bread.  Their regular extra virgin olive oil has a faint bitter, peppery finish, but overall a more neutral flavor -- good all around olive oil and a safer bet for those who are sensitive to bitter or stronger flavors.

review/text: After reading alot of favorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to buy some early harvest Bariani from Fall 08.<br />Overall, I was very turned off by the taste of this olive oil.  I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.  And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting.  I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil.

review/summary: Bariani Olive Oil - Is it worth it?
review/text: Generally I buy olive oil in large 2 liter containers because we use in for cooking, baking and just about anything that asks for lard or butter.  We feel using olive oil is a far healthier and tastier souce of oil to use than the latter.  However, when I started researching more and hearing stories of outdated olive oil and needing to have it in a dark container I became worried about where I get my olive Oil... Generally at Sams Club or Costco....  So I opted to spend a few extra bucks more to get it in a dark bottle and hopefully current year stock.  I purchased this lovely Bariani EVOO and it looked and smelled great, but honestly it didn't taste any different than the EVOO that I get elsewhere and the date on the bottle was confusing.... harvested in 2010 and bottled in 2011?  Since I just purchased it September 2011 I was trying to figure out why. So, I contacted the company that produces this oil hoping to get some clarification on the details (since olive oil does not improve with age) and never heard back from them.  So now I won't bother spending the extra money on that product.  I did buy their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WK3F9Q">Bariani Balsamic Vinegar 16.9 oz.</a> and that is superb, but again sine I never heard from the company, why should I buy from them again?  Disappointed!<br /><br />UPDATE----- Since the Bariani company did not respond I contacted a reputable California company "Calolea" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IUSIFO">Calolea California Mission Blend Extra Virgin Olive Oil 500 Ml</a>and they offered this informative response:<br /><br />Olives are harvested here in California between late October thru the middle of January.  It takes some time to do all of the blending and bottling so the oil doesn't usually hit the stores until after the new year.  So it is normal that oils made in 2010 come out in 2011.<br />As to what makes oils extra virgin, it is a reference to how much free fatty acid is present in the oil.  The international standard is .08% of free fatty acid.  The California standard is .05%.  Our olive oil is usually between .01 to .02% so well below the definition of extra virgin.  We accomplish this by picking and pressing within 24 hours. Olive oil does not get better with age!  You should try to get oils that are fresh and use it quickly.  Some companies come out with Olio Nuevo, new oil, during and right after harvest, this is when the oil is at its best but beware because sometimes it is very strong.

review/text: We only just discovered that Amazon sells this oil - we've been buying it direct from Bariani.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers: this is remarkably different from most oils on the market - my last purchase was received 14 days after initial bottling and it does indeed taste like fresh green olives: deep and with a bitter aftertaste. Bought two bottles last time to see the effect of age and were pleased to find that it matures exceptionally well - the taste becomes increasingly mellow and buttery but retains the taste of olives. Wonderful drizzled over antipasti, or simply with crusty bread (and a glass of red (hem, hem). A little bit of Italy in a bottle.<br /><br />Both bottles due to run out soon more is being ordered.<br /><br />Anyone know the case price?

As any extra virgin olive oil, this is not a product to use for cooking, it is very sensitive to high temps, so use it on you salad dressing, smoked salmon, to top off you pizza or anything you like. It is a very light and tasty olive oil.

review/text: I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter (at least the Fall 08 bottling).  The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil.  Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch.

review/summary: Never trust any imported "olive" oil
review/text: Just do a search for the latest exhaustive studies done of all the top imports and a few great california brands - including Bariani.<br /><br />Most all of the imports were oxidized and adulterated - a few of the california most expenside were a bit off too. But this and California Olive ranch were tops.

review/summary: Best Olive Oil Ever!
review/text: I get this at the Sacramento Farmer's Markets, but my dad moved to Colorado and really missed the California Olive Oils. I sent him a bottle of this oil and he was in heaven! It has a strong taste of olives, cloudy, and even olive 'dust' on the bottom - To me, this is a sign of quality you can NEVER get at a grocery store! This oil is best for pesto, dipping bread, and fresher meals--as the taste diminishes with cooking. As a 'foodie', I have never found a better oil! Thank you!

review/summary: Long Time Fan of Bariani Olive Oil
review/text: I absolutely love Bariani Olive Oil robust grassy taste. I cook with it, fry with it, use it fresh from the bottle (great for dipping bread) and yes even put it on my skin as a moisturizer. I first tried Bariani's over ten years ago and have been hooked ever since. Years ago it was not easy to find leaving me to try many others but none compared to the unique clean flavor. I have even traveled to San Francisco just so I could buy it by the gallon (a size not sold over the internet). Does that tell you how hooked I am? The bottle suggests it is best used within six months but I have never had a problem with it going bad.

review/summary: overly bitter
review/text: Earthy? Buttery? Fruity? Peppery? Grassy?<br /><br />If you're looking for something other than bitter, you might want to keep looking. I found this olive oil to be overwhelmingly acrid and bitter: a real disappointment.<br /><br />I understand that the taste profile of good, unadulterated olive oil might include slight bitterness, but with this oil (at least the fall 2008 bottling) bitterness was the only note.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I am really in to locally grown but when it comes to olive oil, that is hard to do. (And who can do without olive oil?) This California oil is as close to Georgia as I have been able to get.  And the taste is amazing!  I also really like the Nourishing Traditions (cookbook- also on Amazon)idea of using unfiltered olive oil and this is it.  I have ordered it elsewhere but it was cheaper on Amazon. Very pleased and will order it again.

review/summary: Good but I prefer the Tuscan ones
review/text: I like this olive oil because it has a distinct grassy taste, but it's not as good as the best Tuscan ones like the Badia A Coltibuono ones especially the Campo Corto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058DL846">Campo Corto 100% Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16.9 oz by Badia a Colitbuono</a>, or Marfuga that you can buy from Williams Sonoma.<br /><br />I enjoyed Bariani's distinctive olive taste which is superior to most good olive oils that you can get for $20 at the supermarket, so I don't think Bariani is that bad but I agree with other reviewers that its aftertaste is bitter rather than peppery. I don't mind the bitterness because I think it adds character but I also like them peppery and this one is not peppery enough.
