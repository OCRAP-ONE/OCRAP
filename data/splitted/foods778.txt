review/summary: 3 out of 3 dogs approve
review/text: At only 92 calories per stick these are a great dog treat. These are a good size treat and being hard and crunchy help keep dogs occupied and also help with breath and teeth. For dogs with sensitive digestion these are gluten free and are made with high protein grain. For human noses these have a slight smell that is not overpowering.<br /><br />We have three dogs with the smallest being around 50-55 pounds. Our puppy is around 65-70 and our biggest around 90 pounds. All three enjoyed the treat stick. Obviously these are all big dogs so I can't speak for small dogs but when all of ours enjoy them I can recommend these to all big dog owners.

review/summary: High Quality Treats
review/text: Chock full of power-house ingredients like quinoa and flax, these treats are thankfully free of wheat, soy and other common allergens making them nice to have on hand for puppy play dates or visiting furry friends who might have dietary restrictions. They have a neutral smell and don't leave smudges or stains on carpet the way many treats can. My dog loved them.<br /><br />The compact, resealable bag is great for travel. My only word of caution is that with only six treats per bag, they go quickly!

review/summary: Dog loved them!
review/text: My 50-lb Beagle/hound mix loved them! Definitely a good choice if you want to give your dog a real treat (and not a frozen carrot or an ice cube) and your dog is on a diet. I wish they lasted longer, though. Our dog is food-motivated so eats quickly, so maybe it will last longer for your dog, but she finished this in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />The treats aren't super-large, either. I'd say they're just right for my dog, so for a bigger dog they might be a bit small (but not a choking hazard or anything, I don't think).

review/summary: My dogs loved them
review/text: I have two labs who love to eat and will eat everything. I also have a foster Lab who is more choosy about what she likes to eat. I offered this treat to all three dogs and they loved it - there was no hesitation about taking or eating it. While they enjoyed the treat, it didn't last very long (I would say at most a minute). If you're looking for a treat that your dogs will take time eating, this isn't it (or maybe it is if you have a smaller dog). But if you're looking for a treat that's healthy and an alternative to the other dental chews out there, this is a good option though a tad expensive (almost $1 each).

review/summary: Surprisingly, All 3 of My Dogs Liked These!
review/text: I say surpisingly because the ingredients were sort of unusual - Cinnamon was one of the main flavors and 1 of my dogs is picky.  All three of them took off with them as if they were special treats, and I had wanted to try them because one of my dogs is on a diet, and this was a low-fat treat.  Unfortunately, there were only 7 in the package, so it's doubtful I'll be buying them again.  I prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AYL9NU">Get Naked Low Calorie Dental Chew Sticks for Dogs, Small/6.2-Ounce, 18 sticks/Pack</a>, because although they are smaller in size, they lasted about as long as this treat, and they weren't all gone after the 2nd one.  Still, The ZOE Low Calorie Chew Sticks would be great for a household that had fewer dogs.

review/summary: My dogs love these!
review/text: I have a Doberman and a Sharpei (they are both 4 years old) who love these chew sticks. They smell like cinnamon and are not messy or gross in any way. They are gluten free which is important for many breeds who may have allergies or skin issues. I would recommend these to other dog owners as long as their dog does not have dental issues. They give the dog a nice chew and crumble a bit so that your dog won't swallow a big chunk by accident. They also have healthy ingredients which more and more dog owners are paying attention to these days. No corn, white flour, or unhealthy animal fats here. Ditch the crummy milk bones and get these.

review/summary: Daisy likes them
review/text: I give 5 stars to anything my dog likes because she's so picky.  People will give her a doggy snack/biscuit and she'll let it drop out of her mouth and onto the ground. So embarrassing.  When I first gave her one of the Zoe Low Calorie chew sticks, she trotted off with it and then laid it down, seemingly forgotten.  I was was ready to say she didn't like them, but, when I gave the stick back to her during her brushing(I have give her something to chew on so she doesn't chew on me), she gobbled it up, and in fact, it took 3 sticks to get through her half hour brush-out(she's a rough collie, like Lassie).<br /><br />Though  Zoe treats are low calorie, something my dog doesn't have to worry about, they still apparently taste good.  They smell like doggy-treat with cinnamon to me, nothing I'd want to eat, but then I'm not the one testing the product.<br /><br />These treats are gluten-free, something I watch out for with my dog because collies are prone to skin problems.  The ingredients are as listed:<br />Brown rice flour<br />organic quinoa flour, vegetable glycerin, gelatin, water, tapioca starch(I've heard this is good in prevent cancer)oat fiber, oat groats, chicken, natural chicken flavor, calcium carbonate, organic flaxseed, carrots, chia seed, cinnamon, carrogeenan, furtooligosachride(A natural probiotic found in bananas), L-carnitrine(helps turn fat into energy).<br /><br />With all this good stuff going on, I wish the kids were still young enough to get them to eat these sticks.  It would be a whole lot healthier than most of the human snacks out there.  And they were never as picky as Daisy.

review/text: I have two large dogs, one is 80lbs and the other is 140lb.  They both took these treats immediately, without even the usual once-over sniff and inhaled them in under 3 minutes. You'd think with the cinnamon flavoring they would have hesitated but not in the least.  Both dogs then licked the carpet to make sure they'd got all the crumbs and then looked at me for more. At $6 a bag I will definitely limit these to once a week.

review/summary: If my dogs could shop they'd buy these treat sticks
review/text: Zeus, my 11-year old, 120# Alaskan malamute is fussy about treats. He approaches all treats with suspicion. And cinnamon spice is not exactly his favorite flavor. He prefers chicken or salmon. Even though these contain chicken and natural chicken flavor they smell like cinnamon and nutmeg. I assumed he would turn up his nose. I set a treat stick at his feet. He ignored it for several minutes so I figured that was that. When I turned my back he started eagerly chewing on it. He devoured it. He begged for more. He loved it! Hey Pep&eacute;! Pep&eacute; is my 2-year old Chihuahua/mini-dachshund. He'll eat anything. I cut one in half for him. He was thrilled. He also loved it. But I knew he would.<br /><br />These treat sticks contain really healthy ingredients like brown rice flour, organic quinoa flour, oat fiber and oat groats. I had to look up FOS - aka fructooligosaccharide. It's a probiotic, which is great. However FOS can cause gas, bloating, and intestinal discomfort. So I recommend one treat per day for large dogs and one half per day for small dogs. My dogs like these treat sticks so much I just set up the subscribe and save for the small and large, low cal for each dog. It's a good deal.

review/summary: Zoe Chew Sticks: "the lifestyle treats for dogs"
review/text: Cinnamon Spice Flavor 6.6.ounce, large size sticks - here's our review, and the opinions of our dogs!<br /><br />Today our dogs tried out the Zoe Chew Sticks.  These sticks were a hit.  They are similar to Pedigree Dentastix, but I think these last longer.  The 6 sticks are each about 5 inches long and the cinnamon flavor actually smelled pretty good.  The packaging says gluten-free, low calorie, and high protein grain for excellent source of energy.  Our Basset Hound, who usually inhales her treats, actually took some time to get through hers.  Our Rat Terrier chewed hers in great gusto.  She's a bit overweight right now, so it was encouraging to find a "low calorie" treat.  We have a visiting Springer Spaniel and she enjoyed the odd treat to her normal rawhide chips.  I did not give it to my older Beagle as she is on a "low protein" diet and the packaging says "high protein".  As the dogs ate them, there were a few that broke off larger pieces to work on.  I wondered if I could break a stick in 1/2 for the smaller dog, but they do not break, or even bend.  They are not greasy and the packaging has a re-sealable zip top for easy storage.  Overall, the dogs really enjoyed the Zoe Chew Sticks and I enjoyed the fact that the sticks seem to be a fairly healthy alternative to raw hide chews.

review/summary: Chewy loves it
review/text: If Chewy could write this review himself, he would tell you how much he loves this treat.  He went nuts when I gave him the first one, and actually played with it a little before consuming it.  Then he stalked me through the house trying to beg for another (actually nudging my hand trying to get to the bag).  I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised by this product.  Normally these "organic" dog products that promise to be so healthy just aren't attractive to dogs.  A lot of good a healthy treat is if the dog won't eat it.  But apparently this one delivers all that plus taste too.  Slightly pricier than other brands of chew sticks, but in this case I would say it was worth it.

review/summary: Babies Love 'Em, Thats Good Enough For Me
review/text: These chew sticks are just the right size for small to medium size dogs.  Ours went to the baby pomeranians and they were an instant hit.  It helps to know that you are providing them with a low calorie snack (especially for those who have more sedentary pets, not a problem here).  These are substantial for their size measuring in at approximately 5 inches by 1/2 inch.  They are also gluten free and full of soluble fiber.  Now, I haven't heard any of our pups complaining about needing to be on a gluten free diet or needing more fiber, but certainly it can't hurt.  All in all, a healthier alternative to some of the other brands out there.

review/summary: Jilly Loved It
review/text: I have to start out by saying that I don't like it "fancy or gourmet" dog products. Dogs will eat just about anything, except for broccoli and carrots with my baby Jilly, and to get some item when you are paying mostly for either package design or brand name isn't something I buy into being that stuff impresses me, not her.  That being said I did like this product and more importantly Jilly loved it.  These have the same X shape as a dentastix, so I have to assume it would help getting rid of some plaque buildup, although there are no claims on the package.  The cinnamon and spice flavor was potent enough that I could smell it when I opened the package, which I liked, being I knew what she is getting.  And even though the flavor might be more for me than for Jilly, it sure is an improvement over liver flavors etc.<br /><br />Compared to similar products this was harder and took her more time to eat, which I liked.  It took her about 8-10 minutes and a lot of similar type products she eats in just a few minutes.  All that being said, I really did enjoy the product for what it was, but I am not so sure about any weight loss or health benefits.  The L-Carnitine proudly displayed on the front of the package, right next to the antioxidants came off as something like lycopene does for people.  Sure it's good for you and you should eat more of it but when you do do you honestly notice a difference in the way you feel?  As to the weight loss aspects, my dog is only about 8 months old and she's normal weight, but a bit husky being she's a lab. She has some small milk dud sized treats that are her absolute favorites that are 3 calories each and a handful would have less calories than this bone, if weight was an issue and Jilly prefers a natural bone (real bone not rawhide) and it takes her a LONG time to eat and I can't believe the amount of calories she gets per preserving is more than 92.<br /><br />Basically, for what it is it's a very good product, that being said there are most likely better options out there if you aren't willing to spend money on the nice smell and nice packaging.  I'm not sure if I would order it again, but maybe being I like to give her a verity in treats being she eats the same old same old kibble.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars.

I thought I would try Zoe treats since they had all natural ingredients and I have very few choices so far that Sophie likes. Well - So far so good, Sophie loves the treats and no problems with her stomach. Because of Sophie's sensitive stomach and size I give her � of a stick at a time and she likes then so well she begs for more. It's nice to find a healthy treat that my Sophie likes.

review/summary: Doggy likey, wallet not so much
review/text: Thought I would try something new since my mixed breed senior stopped eating the daily morning bone (!) we would give him for breakfast (Iam's brand).  He immediately took to these, which kind of surprised me given they are..."spicy" and I never knew him to like things like that.  Who knew dogs like cinnamon?!<br /><br />Anyhoo, seems to like them fine, and I definitely like the fact that they are lo cal, but the price...geez...a little overpriced!  I always thought the Greenies were good, but crazy expensive, and these seem to be priced at least as high as Greenies.<br /><br />Also, the fact that the manufacturer instructions indicate two of these sticks a day, and the fact that there are about 6-8 a pack, seems a little crazy.  So buy 2 packs a week?!  Come on...make a box with 30 or 40 if you want people to actually follow your instructions without buying a silly amount of bags of these things (and hopefully to help get cost down)!  They probably don't do this because people would get sticker shock if they saw these priced in a box (would be approx. $30-$40!)<br /><br />Pricing is way off, but product seems to be good.<br /><br />Edit:  After trying these out, I signed up for a "subscription" to have the larger version (in the shape of bones) delivered via Amazon...and for my biggish dog, I like the bone version much better...he spends more time chewing it (partly why I wanted these was to use as a teeth cleaning device).  If you have a big dog (>70 lbs or so I guess), you might want to check out the Large Zoe dental chew treats instead.  Also note that the "subscribe and save" option via Amazon makes the cost much more palatable, so diminishes my complaint about price somewhat.

review/summary: My dogs love these.
review/text: These are sticks with ribs protruding.  I am going to use the same review I did for another ZOE product, because it is as true for this product as it was for the other one:<br /><br />I have an older dog - Lab/Pit mix = and a puppy - Maltese/ShiTzu mix, about 5 months.  They fight to take these away from each other.  They growl when the other approaches.  It's funny to watch, and they are usually fairly good about sharing.  If Big steals from Little, Little finds Big's treat and steals it for herself.  And vice versa.  Not these.  They go to opposite ends of the house and glare balefully at t'other while they chew.  I would certainly buy these - if my local store carried them and I had a coupon and they were on sale.  I'd like both a coupon AND on sale, but for these, I might only require one; the dogs love them that much.

review/text: I use quite a few kinds of dried beans, and usually pre-soak them to speed cooking. After the usual 1-2 hour pre-soak a high proportion of the red beans remained hard. Even cooking them left about one third at tooth-breaking stage. I have been very disappointed in these small red beans, that I prefer in chili, for the past three years.<br />At first I thought that I had just gotten a bad batch, and avoided using them until the next year. When that batch turned out poorly again , I thought perhaps someone at the packaging plant had mixed the previous year's crop with this year's.  I avoided my favorite beans for another year. The same thing happened this year - 2011, and I decided to measure exactly how bad they were.<br />I took an hour and the pot of pre-soaked beans and picked though them one by one. One full cup of beans remained unusable out of a standard 16 oz package. That's almost 50% by volume!!!<br />I've switched brands.

An order(4-13OZ bags) would provide 104 servings; a great value in price and convenience, as well as, free shipping.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: At my local stores I can only find the Bob's Red Mill TVP, which the web site says is grown from traditional seed but cannot ensure against cross pollination from genetically engineered (insert round up ready) soybean.  That is why I sought out this certified organic version, and if you have tried the tvp then this will be something a little different.  First, the bag seems to be twice the size of the tvp I can buy, which was a nice surprise.. so though this was more expensive than I had first hoped after seeing the size of the bags and receiving an entire box of it I realized that really its a great deal.  Also, this TSP is slightly larger granules, so it takes a little longer to re-hydrate and has a little more tooth to it, which I actually like, it makes it feel a bit more meaty.  Encourage the growth and preservation of our traditional soybean crops, I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I loved this decaf when I had it at my brother's home. So I ordered two bags. When I made my first pot it was ok, not great. A few days later I ground beans from the same bag and made a second pot.  It was absolutely undrinkable!  It tasted rancid, weak and disgusting --  as if the beans were bad.  I put the same amount in as I always had before.  I don't know what to think of this.  I will try one more time, but if I can't drink it - I want my money back!  It wasn't that cheap.

review/summary: Don't throw away your wireless thermometer!
review/text: Before giving up on your wireless thermometer, try replacing the probe!  I'm on my third probe now, which is frustrating, but these things are only $15 bucks.  A new 'Grill Alert' is $70!  Each probe that I've had seems to last a few years before I start getting screwy readings.  When I replace the probe, the unit works fine again.  I think the probes are only rated to 400 degrees, so that's definitely the weak link in this otherwise excellent system.  Now I'm ordering two probes, just so that I can have a spare ready to go.

review/summary: Bad probe design.....
review/text: The probe has a braided metal outer jacket on the cable that causes any flexing of the cable to strain the cable where it exits the probe.  This condition causes failure (shorting of the sensor wires to the jacket) at that point.  I have had 2 other probes with this type of cable that failed in that mode.  The best type of cable is a thick silicone jacket like used on microwave temp probes.

It works perfectly and seems to be a little sturdier and better built than the original. The cord is a couple of inches shorter than the original which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/text: Okay, this will teach me twice about checking the weight of something before I buy it!  I love these gummy candies and always stock up on them whenever I hit the Asian grocery stores.  So when I saw them online, I admit to being a bit lazy and thought 'hey, it'll be nice to take advantage of getting them shipped home for free' and wrongly assumed that the price of the bag meant that they must be jumbo-sized or something.  So yeah, a bit surprised when the package arrived and it's the same size bag that I can usually get for a few bucks cheaper in a store.  Also, the bag was past its 'best sold by' date (not that the candies tasted stale).<br /><br />Still, these candies are delicious, a nice sweet/tart gummy treat that's individually wrapped (great if you like to share or put something unique out for people) and has a good fruit flavor.  If you can't get to an Asian grocery store, then maybe the price would be worth it.  For myself, I think I'll be a bit less lazy and just stock up more often.

It's as if each candy has absorbed some terrible plastic taste... something I smelled when I first opened the bag. So not to waste them, I rinse off the outer layer of each candy to get to the better tasting candy below. But I hope this is not indicative of their other products. And it's not as if I can find any company website to complain to.

I mix the wet with the dry and our Yorkies lap it down quick. I can also hide my Yorkie's morning pill with it and she doesn't realize she's taking her medicine.

review/summary: Used This for a Starved Rescue Hound
review/text: I have been involved in dog rescue for many years. I recently took in a very large hound who had been starved within an inch of his life. The vet recommended this (in addition to many other treatments and holistic measures, including yogurt!) to try to quickly get some weight on and good nutrition into the dog. You'd think a starving dog would eat anything, but often times they will not. I had to bake this hound homemade meatloaf for a month. Wellness and Nutro canned were the only "dog foods" I could get him to eat. But he did gain weight steadily, was able to wean off 'human food', and did very well.  After gaining 20 lbs, he was adopted by a wonderful family. When you need the best, any of the Wellness Brands I would highly recommend.

He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and otehr healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.

review/summary: Great for hiding medication.
review/text: My dog is now older so she is not happy having to take so many pills. I switched from the more solid Wellness (which is still pretty good) to the stew line since thanks to the thick gravy I no longer have to use most of the can to hide medication. I agree with some of the reviews that my dogs stools were a little on the runny side but figuring out that it was due to whitefish and not of the food itself I just stopped buying the ones with whitefish listed and she has yet to have the same side effect. So take that into account with your pet it could be something listed that was not apart of your dog food before.

review/summary: Wellness Canned Dog Food for Adult Dogs, 95-Percent Lamb, 12-Pack of 13.2-Ounce Cans
review/text: I like the fact that Wellness offers grain free all meat canned and limited ingredient allergy dry food. Unfortunately my old dog has serious skin issues that Wellness also did not seem to correct so I have decided to take him off commercial foods completely and he now eats only organic human grade freeze dried artisan dog food. Wellness dog food is probably one of the better choices if you feed your dog commercial foods so I recommend this product over other cheaper commercial brand names. Amazon prices are the best and shipping to Maui excellent.

review/summary: Pricey Stuff and Hardens up Real Fast!
review/text: I thought I would try this stuff for my finicky dog who needs moist food along with his kibble.  He was not a big fan of it and it was the most expensive moist food at Petsmart.  The other problem is this stuff hardens up like concrete in his bowl. If he wouldn't eat the food in about two hours the stuff turned as hard as a sidewalk and I had to literally scrape it out of his bowl.

review/summary: Tasty topper my dog loves!!!!!
review/text: I just got my 1yr old shihtzu the turkey and she loves it. I mix it with her dry food. It does have a gel substance around the food. I just mix the entire can up gel and all and put it in a small tupperware container. I put left overs in the fridge. My extremely picky girl had her nose in the can while I was trying to scoop the food out. She licked her bowl clean. So happy I found this stuff. Also it actually smells good. I didn't think it smelled at all. My girl is allergic to chicken so I was very happy to find wellness made several flavors without any chicken and grain free. Highly recommend this dog food.

review/summary: Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods
review/text: Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness. By the time he did show weakness, the Cancer was far too advanced to operate on or save him and he died within a month.<br /><br />That set me to feeding my two dogs (His mate who is still with me, and her new mate) ONLY quality dog food. It costs more; but after seeing what was in the average store dog food on internet posts, and confirmed on dog food cans labels, that convinced me to try something better.<br /><br />I researched the net for the top ten dog foods, and this brand kept coming up in the lists consistently; including Veterinary sites. Made only with grain free quality ingredients,and other healthy additions for good digestion, my two dogs eat it enthusiastically, and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Both dogs are fed Wellness brand "Beef Stew" and Wellness brand "Lamb and Beef Stew", alternating for variety in their diets; they love both equally, and both canned foods are equally healthy.

review/summary: My Chihuahua Loves this Stuff
review/text: I've been feeding Wellness food to my Chihuahua for nearly a year and she loves it. She dances around eager for her breakfast when I start scooping it into her dish. I would give it 5 stars, except that it is difficult to find in the 6 oz size, and it has that room-filling reek that most canned dog foods have (which my dog loves, but I hate). She has not had any digestive issues with the food, and I like that the first three ingredients on the list are all turkey, and the following three are vegetables. I can actually see the sweet potato in the food. My dog doesn't have any food allergies, but I have read that foods using alternative meats such as turkey, lamb and duck can help if your dog has poor reaction to beef based foods. As long as they keep making this, I'll keep buying it.

I'm glad to report after a week on Wellness Lamb and Sweet Potato, in addition to the Core dry food, Gil's stomach problems are over.<br /><br /> This is Human Grade Food for dogs.  He gets one 6 ounce can a day and munches on core dry all day. I also cut out all processed dog treats. We stick with fresh food treats such as: apple, sweet potato, egg, and some cheese once in awhile. Frozen string beans in an ice cube tray are also great!<br /><br />Please take care to feed your dogs and cats natural foods!  Read articles on rendered meats, your stomach will turn.  Take care!

review/summary: Cleared my Dogs Eyes Right Up! No more RX's for Her!
review/text: My dog loves this....and so do we!  Miki has been having problems for over a year with the skin just outside of her tear ducts getting red, then raw...poor thing.  Each time I'd take her to the vet, (2 different vets just to see), they  both prescribed the same eye drop medicine ($27.00) for a tiny bottle.  But, it never cleared up entirely, and the minute I'd stop with the drops, after weeks of applying 2-3 x's a day, it would come right back. Looking at her made me feel terrible.<br /><br />Then, I started thinking about maybe it was something she is eating, even though I've been feeding her Ceasar for a couple years and thought it to be a "good" dog food.  But after researching what was in Wellness dog food compared to the store bought stuff, I couldn't believe I was feeding her that stuff!<br />So, after doing the math, a 3oz tub of Ceasar vs the 12 1/2 oz can of Wellness, I could get 3 bigger servings (4.1 oz each) out of a can of Wellness...for the same, or better price, and it was way healthier for her!<br /><br />Our Miki looks so pretty again (Papillon) and seems she has a whole lot more energy too! I figure it must be the change in diet that helped clear up her eyes but wasn't sure because we moved at the same time (same town) and I thought it might have been some plants/allergies she was getting into in the back yard.  But....I let myself run out of Wellness (not on purpose!) and had to feed her something else, so I went with the Ceasar and ordered her some more Wellness.  By the time I placed and received my order, (not much more than a week), the skin below her eyes had already broken out again! Ummmm...CONFIRMATION! And guess what?  Within 2 weeks after our Wellness shipment arrived, and she was back eating her favorite dog food, Miki's tear duct area was dried up, rawness gone, and hair was growing back!<br /><br />I don't even remember how I stumbled across this dog food, and who would have ever thought I'd be ordering dog food from Amazon, but with the great price, and free super saver shipping, like I said earlier, it's the same price as that store bought "stuff", but she gets more than an ounce more per serving and look at the ingredients...it's real chicken, and sweet potatoes! (A lot of other good for her stuff!)<br /><br />I'm sold on Wellness (so is Miki~she loves it!) I had just come back online to re-order some more Wellness Chicken and Sweet Potato food, when I thought that I should take a moment to RAVE about this great stuff.<br />So I did!

review/summary: Looks like Pate meh  -1 star
review/text: well I gave this product 4 stars because the purpose I used it for was not intended.  I saw that it had 95%  meat which was perfect (in my mind) for a cat diet, and the price point was nearly half of that which is for cats.<br /><br />FTR:  Cats and dogs have two completely and vastly varied nutritional needs, in my research I recall reading that a cat's diet is mainly 95% meat (from which they derive their moisture/water from as well) since cats hunt and eat small rodents and birds in nature this makes sense, since the 5% veggie content is likely from eating cat grasses and the contents of their prey's tummy at the time of death.<br /><br />I decided to purchase this food since it was only 2.56 a can at Unleashed and I figured I would just add in a calcium supplement, and taurine, and cat vitamin supplement to make up for the missing bones which would provide the natural calcium source for cats, and taurine since I don't believe dogs require as much taurine in their diets as cats would and vitamins to make up for the possibility that there may not be enough vitamins in just meat alone.<br /><br />My cats loved it.  I have one very finicky girl kitty whom refuses to eat human foods (which is a good thing)  and most junky cat foods (another good thing)  and one male cat that eats whatever he can get his whiskers into.  They both liked this.  So I would consider feeding this to them in lieu of the more expensive cat foods (after I compare the ingredients of this to that of cat foods and make up the missing vitamins and minerals)  however I am not happy with the fact that this cat food has the consistency of pate..<br /><br />it is all ground up meats and looks like refried beans... I'm going to search for a similar product which has shredded meat rather than this consistency :)

review/text: This 12-pack case is a great value and is actually about 20 cents cheaper per can than my local pet food store. It arrived very quickly at our house and only one of the cans had a small dent at the base. It still made the swoosh sound when I opened it with the can opener, so the vacuum was still good and the food was still fresh. Great deal, and now I don't have to run out to the pet food store after work every few days to pick up more cans. I can simply drive home to my baby puppy at the end of the day. I did notice that all my dogs have had softer stools with this food, but if I mix it with the dry food and feed less frequently they don't have too much of a problem.

review/summary: Perfect as an occasional supplement!
review/text: My wife and I bought a couple cans of this food for a few days when we were away from home with our dog. It is a little pricey, but then again this is definitely not meant as a daily meal - it even plainly says on the can to feed supplementally only!<br /><br />PROS<br />- Our dog loves it!<br />- 95% chicken content, no fillers<br />- Perfect for road/camping trips<br />- No gastrointestinal discomfort that we could see<br /><br />CONS<br />- Not human grade meat<br /><br />It is important to understand the difference between quality in meats for dog (and cat) food. Much research has been done on the subject (easily found on Google), but my wife and I decided some months ago to only feed our dog human-grade meat, termed in the pet food industry as "inspected for human consumption". The chicken used in the wellness food is NOT inspected for human consumption, however since we have only fed our pup this twice, we aren't too worried. If Wellness switched to human-grade meat, I would happily give this the full five stars, and this is really the only criticism I could give for this product.<br /><br />OVERALL<br />I would recommend this as an occasional food for your dog, with the one reservation noted above.

review/text: It seemed like our dogs were getting tired of the same old thing for dinner, so I did some research and found this Wellness brand dog food. What I liked about it was the lack of by-products and cereals. Our dogs love the taste of this food and there is never any left in their bowls. It is a well baqlanced food that good for them also and having it shipped directly to my door saves us a trip to the pet stores. I count on Amazon for the best products.

review/summary: Favorite of my dog's food
review/text: This is, by far, the favorite of my dogs canned food(one of the more expensive, of course).  If I want to be sure she is eating, I just put this down.  She has never failed to clean her bowl when it contains the lamb.  Her digestive system seems to handle it quite well for canned food.  My only complaint is the cost, but she is worth it.

review/summary: Lamb and beef stew
review/text: My 4 yr old poodle loves this mixture. The combination of chunks and gravy are very exciting to him. Something to chew rather than swallow.

review/summary: A really good product.
review/text: After researching dog foods, I went with Wellness core and my little dog loves it!! I feed Wellness core and put 1/2 can of the canned in with it and am so pleased that my dog begs for "mealtime".

review/summary: Good Choice
review/text: I just wanted to supplement the dry food that I feed my two schnauzers. I tried several other brands and even other canned food by this same brand. My dogs did not do well on any of them until I tried this one. They love it and it does not cause stomach upset or potty problems. I highly recommend this product for extra protein, esspecialy if your dog has a delicate system.

review/summary: Good but Beware!
review/text: This is definitely a great product since all the ingredients are quality stuff. However, like some reviewers have stated or I read from the label about how some dogs can't take the 95% meat contend. My dog is one of them. She would have diarrhea if I mixed too much of this food with her dry food.  She LOVES this.  I have to mix VERY little into her dry food so she won't have any stomach problem. I would recommend this product; just add a little to the dry food to avoid any problems.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: This dog food is excellent! My Shih Tzu's are thriving on it, they are healthier and full of energy, no allergy problems that plaqued them in the past. Yes it is a little more expensive, but well worth it for the health of your pups! I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Wellness is top dog
review/text: My Heidi is a Bichon with allergies and her doctor told me to keep her on Duck and Potato food as these were the least likely to cause an allergic reaction.  I, of course, wanted the best for my Heidi and Wellness is the best.

review/summary: Not a balanced meal -
review/text: If my dog were reviewing this, he'd give it 5 stars - but that's because he's not aware that nutritional imbalances are possible.  It's high quality - and he thinks it's delicious.<br /><br />I looked back at the page after ordering to see if I'd just missed a warning, but I don't think it's there. The page is not clear enough, in my opinion - that this is NOT a balanced diet. I didn't realize until it arrived and has a note on it that says "Wellness 95% Canned Recipes are intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only."<br /><br />I get that I should have been aware that something with so few ingredients is obviously not enough for long term feeding, but I do think the page should have a more clear note on it so that when people are ordering a few cases of food quickly it's clear that this one is really more a treat than a meal.<br /><br />It's good though, for what it aims to be: a canned chicken treat to serve in addition to your dog's normal diet.

review/summary: Great food, and perfect sized cans.
review/text: I mix this soft food with my Boston Terrier's dry food, so I don't use much for each meal. Using the larger cans meant I would end up throwing half a can away.<br /><br />Wellness brand is very high quality food, and has been working very well for our dog who has a very sensitive stomach.

review/summary: Stinky but my dogs love it!
review/text: Even though this is 95% chicken, it looks like cat food (ground up texture) and smells like stinky canned chicken.  It's a very strong smell!  My dogs go NUTS for this, though (1 Labrador and 2 Boston Terriers).  I just add a couple spoonfuls as a topper to their dry food, so one can lasts awhile.  I probably will try something less smelly next time but I like the quality of the ingredients and like the Wellness brand.
