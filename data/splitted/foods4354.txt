review/summary: Can't live without it! (and a hint for bakers)
review/text: If you want something that doesn't pack the calories and leaves you satisfied, this is it.  I have used it for years.  One thing though...if you use it to bake, and can have sugar, I would recommend doing 1/2 sugar twin and 1/2 sugar.  In other words, if something calls for two cups of sugar....use one cup sugar twin and one cup sugar.  I have found that if I use all sugar twin, I am not as happy with the texture. Things do not seem to rise as well (more dense).  I hate it that I can't pick this up at the store anymore, but was glad to see that they are not out of business and that it is still available.  When I use splenda my ankles swell and my joints hurt.  I dont have any of those problems with this product.

review/summary: Splended it aint
review/text: Very sweet that takes getting used to and amount to be used, but the price so under cuts the other yellow package sweetener, any inconvenience or mild taste  differential is not worth spending on the Splendid brand.<br /><br />I wouldnt bake with it as another customer noted, despite what the box suggests, the taste is not a substitute for sugar etc.

review/text: I've tried it to sweeten oatmeal and I've tried it to bake cookies.  In both cases it tasted horribly bitter with a very sick sweet after taste.  From research I found that can happen with baking.  I thought it was designed for baking though.  My wife likes it even less than I do.  Now I need to figure out what to do with the rest of the box.

review/text: I used to drink "other" brands of coffee all my life. One day a friend gave me some Melitta coffee because she did not like it. I tried it. It was alright but I wanted more coffee flavor so I kept trying different blends of the Melitta coffee until one day I discovered the dark roast Melitta coffee. I started drinking it and now I love it and I prefer that brand over any other one. To me it is simply the best, especially with my favorite coffee creamer added to it.

review/summary: An Excellent Blend
review/text: In my book, the best coffee is to be found in Northern Europe. From The Netherlands through Germany to Denmark, coffee is dark, aromatic, rich, and mellow. This blend from Melitta comes as close as any I've found (including several widely available German brands) to replicating the coffee to be found in those countries' coffee houses.<br /><br />My only complaint is that it's not being given away free. But that's a complaint I have about most things I like!

This material does not protect the flavor of the coffee, and it makes a big difference in the final  brewed beverage. Why is amazon sending such an inferior product? Not sure if we will reorder.

review/summary: Just like the coffee in Europe!
review/text: I've used several different brands of coffee over the years, and this is my new favorite.  Before this I typically bought Eight O'clock coffee from the grocery store.  I bought a can of Melitta European Roast one time when it was on sale, and now this is the brand I keep stocked in our kitchen.  My husband and I, and many of our friends and family love the taste of this coffee.  It tastes a lot like coffee I've had in Europe - the Melitta is 100% Arabica beans, which is what most European coffees use.  Best of all, the price is very reasonable!

review/text: I also bought this on the King Arthur site and when I saw it here, knew I needed to review it. When I got this, I was nervous because on the KA site, some loved it and others totally hated it. You can put me firmly in the camp of "love it"!<br /><br />Scent wise, the best way to describe this is a mild buttery smell mixed with citrus (no particular one, just a general citrus scent) and vanilla. I have had to laugh at myself because every time I go to get something from my spice cabinet, I pull this out and give it a sniff.<br /><br />In cooking, you don't want to (or need to) use as much of this as you would a regular extract. It's definitely stronger and too much would, I'm sure, lend an unpleasant flavor and/or bitter edge to baked goods. But when I used 1/4 teaspoon in a batch of cinnamon rolls, it added this undefinable flavor that everyone loved. I have yet to try it in other baked goods, but I can easily imagine it in pound cake, layer cake, certain types of cookies and possibly cheesecake and some types of home made ice cream. All in all, if you enjoy the scents I describe above, you will probably love this.

review/summary: Spicey good
review/text: I haven't received this item yet, however, I did receive as a gift the Volcano Dust 2. I was honestly scared eating it at first knowing that it contained the ghost pepper, but my opinion changed when I used it. I have had the ghost pepper in liquid form, and no matter how much I used, it was freakin' hot to the point it was not enjoyable. With this, I do not know if it is because it is in powdered form, you can control how much of a kick you want. I'll gently tap the bottle to just get some coated on my meats that I may be using. It smells to me of smokey beef jerkey and imparts a smokey flavor too. The actual site [...] advertised that the habanero in it is smoked, reason for the smell and taste. If you enjoy spicey food, I highly recommend. If any one loves mole, the chocolate habanero will be just that, but without the actual sauce I imagine. Can't wait!

review/summary: A good substitute for peanut butter
review/text: After researching on line only to discover it had to be ordered by the case I picked up the 11 oz. jar at Publix.  Never having tasted Almond Butter before, I didn't know what to expect.  To me, it was bland and in a blindfold test would not have been able to identify the flavor.  Okay, lesson learned.  Trying to figure out what was needed to make it more palatable I mixed in a couple small teaspoons of Agave Nectar.  Presto!  You could do the same with honey.  Made all the difference in the world. At $8.50 for an 11 oz. jar it is pricey.  However it is a good substitute for peanut butter, which has all the unhealthy oil additives that are so bad for you, and I will probably continue buying it since I'm the only one in the house who uses it.

review/summary: miracle honey
review/text: This honey was suggested for my young son's warts.  He had eczema as a baby and rapidly spreading warts is a common link to people with eczema.  At our last count he had over 25 warts on his two hands.  We tried everything to get rid of them from over-the-counter products to several doctor visits to 'freeze' the warts.  Nothing was successful.  Finally a plastic surgeon recommended this honey because of its success in patients with eczema and psoriasis.  Within a week of using the honey the warts were visibly much smaller.  Now that the honey is gone so are the warts!  We are so pleased that our little guy didn't have to go through any more painful treatments!  It is a miracle!

review/summary: MRSA gone with Manuka honey!
review/text: My mother contracted MRSA through a pressure sore at a hospital. No antibiotic can ever get rid of MRSA, it kept coming back and the bedsore getting worse. We bought the MGO 400 Manuka honey, started putting in the wound and in all MRSA sores, the next day there was a significant improvement over all. Now, it's been 5 days, the pressure sore is almost completely healed and the MRSA has not come back like it did on a daily basis, there is nothing but beautiful skin, no sores, no redness. IT'S A MIRACLE! Praise God for the Manuka plant, for honey bees and for this wonderful discovery. Now I read it's also good for arthritis so I am going to start using it on my mother's knees which have very bad pain from arthritis. I recommend this as a miracle honey for many uses, it is also USDA approved for wound care, any kind of wound.

review/summary: should be a staple in every medicine cabinet
review/text: I am very pleased to have found an all natural treatment for so many conditions. I have used this honey for a nasal staph infection I had that wouldn't go away with oral antibiotics.  I felt completely safe using honey rather than artificial ingredients inside my nose.  After using manuka for a week, the staph infection cleared up. I've used this honey for cuts, burns and any kind of rash (as a massage therapist, I've picked up a few skin conditions) that develops and it has never failed to heal them.  When used internally, it's helpful for fighting off colds or at the very least, cutting its duration.  This is an amazing product!

review/summary: really great
review/text: I have used Manuka honey for a couple of years now.  My respiratory doctor had recommended the honey to me when I had a very bad cold.  I tried a few different brands but I have found this brand to be ABSOLUTELY the best.  The honey has therapeutic properties and really helps with colds, sore throats and acid reflux.  It is a great homeopathic remedy.<br />The honey comes from the tea tree and the best/purest comes from New Zealand.  I was told some brands repackage their honey in the USA and put regular honey in the mix.  The pure manuka is really the prize in the honey.

review/summary: Healed a pesky area
review/text: For 3.5 years i suffered from a vaginal ulcer and scarring from vulvar vestibulitis. I had had the surgery to remove the damaged tissue and ulcer because the damage was done and the pain was permanent so the scarred skin had to be removed. one week after the surgery the doctor noted that the area was not healing at all(probably half the reason i got that damned ulcer to begin with do to my bodies lack in ability to heal itself)so he wanted me to try putting manuka honey all over the stitches and skin down there, but not before expressing his concerns that some patients have reactions to the thoney and it didnt work for them. well two weeks later after using the honey twice aday, the doctor was shocked because I had healed so much. he said in the two weeks of using the honey, it did about three weeks of healing. Today I still use the honey all the time before and after intercouse with the hubby, so if any skin breaks it will heal pretty fast and prevent another ulcer or just help with the pain. There is no itching with the use with the honey and it is actually very soothing to use.<br />Hate having to gross you all out with this review but I noticed there werent any reviews on how this honey helped heal the girl parts. Also, I use the honey while i'm on my cycle to protect my surgical area (although healed) from the blood b/c its too acidic and can "burn" the skin. interesting fact my doctor told me.

review/summary: 400+ is overkill and way more expensive
review/text: I bought this for a skinned knee that wouldn't heal.  I read a little about this honey before I ordered it and thought more powerful is better.  I did more research and clinical studies from New Zealand have proven that MGO 250 (old 16+) is just as effective at less than half the price.<br /><br />The reason that Manuka honey works is probably due to its methylglyoxal content (which is a common element in many foods).  Unfortunatley, methylglyoxal is considered to be a genotoxin.  I use it externally but I'm a little reluctant to consume it regularly.  It does help wounds heal without infection.  I put a little on the wound and cover it with a adhesive bandage or gauze.  The bandage needs to be changed regularly.<br /><br />It does work as an antacid.  It takes about a teaspoon -- preferably on a small pice of bread.

review/summary: This isnt your regular table honey, this honey heals!
review/text: I have used this Manuka Honey for various types of degree burns. Burns heal, faster, cleanly and leave less scarring. I also used it on a really bad laceration and crushed finger tip that was almost cut off from a door. The price might be a little expensive, but its well worth the price for the healing properties this awesome medical grade honey has. Look for either the MGO 400 or its equivalent UMF 20+. This type of honey is not like table honey, it a powerful honey that is only found and created in New Zealand and has great antimicrobial, anti-fungus, antibacterial, antiviral, antibiotic and antiseptic properties. It can also be used for acne, skin disorders, and is safe for use in infections in the eye socket, nasal cavity, and ear cavity. It may be taken orally to provide great health for your digestive system and overall health. Do your own research and be patient, and you will see its great healing benefits. I highly recommend this product!

review/summary: burning fire in my guts gone
review/text: I just ordered another jar. I have been suffering form intense heartburn and reflux that no antacid or ppi would cure. I was having lung complications due to aspiration.I went through 4 different types of ppi and even to the hospital for burning so intense I felt like I was dying. This went on for months. Out of desperation I stumbled upon Manuka and since I have tried everything else I thought it was worth a shot. I stopped taking all my ppi's and antiacids and started with the honey. I just finish the jar and I am so relieved to say that w/in 4 days the burn was completely gone! I am going to another round. I read on another brand of Manuka honey's website that it is actually dangerous to consume this honey and in repeated tests in NZ and the UK that no clinical results to heal H pylori have been found. That testing has shown results for treating MRSA and other external infections. This news scares me a bit. It said the it could aid in precursors to cancer causing compounds found in the body so this will probably be the last jar I consume but I do not find it coincidental that it worked for me and many others. When I started using it in conjunction with chamomile tea in the morning the burning just completely dissipated. So my advice is to do your own research. The higher the MGO the higher the toxins in it.

review/summary: Plastic jar!
review/text: This product of Manuka Honey is in a plastic jar.  Had I known it was in plastic I would not have purchased it, as the temperature here on the day of delivery was 114 degrees F, and it was in a delivery van which can get over 160 degrees inside, where the product sat all day.  So the product is useless to me as the plastic has leeched into the honey and is toxic.  There is no indication that this is in plastic; the photo appears to be glass.  A waste of money.  I gave three stars instead of one, basically because  the product itself is probably good, regardless of the packaging making it unusable either as food or on skin.

review/text: I bought this product for my mom who has had a violent cough accompanied by phlegm for 10+ years.  She has been told she has acid reflux.  She's tried many drugs and remedies but nothing has eliminated her coughing.  I told her to take 1 tsp/day of Manuka honey and see what happens.  It's been about 3 weeks and she says her cough seems to be getting better but she was taking Prilosec for part of that time so she's not sure if the honey or the drug is working.  Now, she has stopped the Prilosec, and is only taking this product.  Her coughing bouts are much less than they were so it appears that this product is definitely helping.  We're very optimistic.  I would say it's definitely worth a try for acid reflux.

review/summary: Yeah, Yeah, miracle drug, but how does it taste and is it worth the price
review/text: Yes, Manuka honey is special.  It is cultivated only in New Zealand and southeast Australia.  It has also been used by some researchers in a clinical trial as a medicinal honey to ameliorate some of the ill effects of cancer treatment.  It probably works in some medical indications.  But this is not because it has magic powers or that it is vastly different from other honeys.  Manuka honey is used as a medicinal honey rather than other honeys because it is very well characterized chemically.  That characterization is consistent because Manuka honey comes from only two very similar flowers.  This honey is unusually viscous and it has relatively high concentrations of the chemicals that kill bacteria in honey.  But, most good honeys are viscous and have antibacterial potency; they are just not as well characterized for medicinal purposes.  As far as using it as a folk remedy for all these various conditions?  Honey has been used as a folk medicine for centuries and it works for some things.  As a toxicologist, I have to say `well maybe it will work for this or that, but we cannot really know if something works medically until we do a clinical trial.'  The reported `cures' are possibly real and are probably the result of immune stimulation or antibacterial activity that might occur with any honey.  But for most people it is really all about how the honey tastes (unless you are on a clinical trial).<br /><br />I think it tastes rather good.  It is floral and complex and full of flavor.  Its viscosity means it clings to your hot biscuit better than most and it comes in a fancy jar.  But my wife did not like it.  It was not clear but rather cloudy like honey that has begun to precipitate out its sugar.  But that was not the source of the cloudiness; it was actually due to the presence of honey comb.  And the honey tastes of comb, which my wife found a bit objectionable.<br /><br />So why buy this honey.  I really cannot think of a reason unless you are trying to impress someone.  I have had much better, much clearer honey from a roadside stand in North Carolina, particularly sourwood.  And this stuff is terribly expensive.  I do not see anything wrong with trying it on your warts but you might try a cheaper honey first.  Yeah but there is that impress people thing.

review/text: Like another reviewer, my cats do not chow down on this stuff.  They nibbled and don't eat as much of it.  But they are not starving, nor are they complaining.  I think with the high quality food, and the lack of fillers and/or taste additives that cover the ickiness of regular in-store cat food, they don't have to eat as much to get their nutritional needs fulfilled.  They aren't losing weight and their coats are lush, glossy, and healthy.  I am sticking with it!

review/summary: High quality cat food!
review/text: Previously I fed my cat a grocery store brand and was looking for an organic replacement that didn't use corn and meat by-products as main ingredients.  I decided to give Organix a try, even though I was skeptical my cat would like it.  She won't eat anything but Organix now and as other reviewers have reported, I did notice that she had a shinier coat after a couple of months.  High quality ingredients + organic =  very happy with Organix!

review/summary: great indoor cat food
review/text: Our 8 year old indoor cat loves this food, her coat is glossy, she has lots of energy and she has even trimmed down a bit. She had bladder stone surgery 4 years ago and since being on this food has not had any problems in regards to reforming stones. I like the high quality and the price is reasonable .

review/summary: Purrrfect
review/text: I recently took a good look at my diet and decided I needed to eat more healthfully.  I then noticed some promotions for a more "healthy" cat food and since I really care about my cats, I phased them into one of these products.  But then I read the fine print on the package and began to do some research on the web.  This new product rearranged some ingredients but really was not all that different from what I had been feeding them, only was more expensive.  More research found some products that actually did have much healthier ingredients than the corn meal and other fillers.  Now, would the cats LIKE the new food...<br />Yes they did.  Organix has quality ingredients that should provide a much better diet for my cats and they are very fond of it.  I had searched numerous stores locally for a quality product, hopefully Organix, and found very few.  No Organix.  I then checked Amazon and discovered I can purchase Organix there.  I have joined Amazon's subscription program so that I am shipped this product on a regular basis that works for me and the cats.  Total satisfaction.

review/summary: Do not recommend...
review/text: I recently adopted a 6 month old kitten from the humane society, and bought this food ahead of time.  I liked that both adult cats and kittens could eat this food, and I wanted a high quality food for my new pet.  Unfortunately, my kitten does not seem to like this food.  At first, I thought it was just the adjustment period of a new home, but after time, I have found that he really just does not like this food at all.  When mixed with other food (both wet and dry) he picks this dry food out and will not eat it.  Now, I am stuck with 14.5 pounds of this cat food that my cat refuses to eat.  Do not recommend.

review/summary: My Cat Loves It!
review/text: My cat has always loved Organix Adullt cat food!  Yes, she gets moist food daily and she loves tuna.  She also has free choice of three different high quality dry cat foods, including Organix, each in a small bowl.  The Organix bowl is always the first to be empty, by a wide margin.  So, I decided to go for the big bag -- 14.5 pounds -- the Amazon price is right (especially compared to over $50 locally) and I know it will all be eaten up soon enough.  Then, I'll get more -- from Amazon!

review/summary: Cat's put their noses up to it but dog loves hers
review/text: The cat's seemed to want something different than the Organix dry chicken so we tried the alternate flavor with the fish.<br />They almost refuse to eat it. I quickly had to purchase more of the chicken flavor to mix more of it in and they picked around and left the fish. Money wasted.<br />Actually, it looks like they just don't like any of the Organix flavors we've tried.<br />They eat it but they make it clear they don't like it.<br />I love all of the information on the package but the cats just don't.<br />As an aside: The dog food is a real hit! She thinks she is getting a treat each time she eats. We've tried many foods because she is very old, and it's hard for her to digest. But eating breakfast with the treats in Organix has become an even more special highlight of her day. (She's always been a lover of veggies and certain fruits, though) :)

review/summary: My Cats Love this Food
review/text: I have gradually made the switch to organic foods for myself, but was still feeding my cats non-organic. If the big agriculture business harms the planet making human food, it must do the same making food for our pets.<br /><br />I bought Organix after seeing some good reviews for it. It costs more, but the ingredients are high-quality. I have noticed that my cats need less of it, so the same size bag as conventional food goes farther. My cats also love the taste of this food.<br /><br />Organix is good for my cats and better for our planet.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LL7AL6">Organix Organix Adult and Kitten Dry Cat Food, 14.5-Pound</a>

review/summary: The only reason its not 5 stars is price!
review/text: I have been using this food exclusively for my fur babies for almost 10 years!  I figured that if I was worth organic food so were they!  They love the food too. They throw up a lot less, never have diarrhea, and stay cleaner down there if you know what I mean!  LOL  Their coats are all glossy and soft too.  I had one kitty who always had really course hair before I switched to this brand.  After a few months on this brand exclusively, her hair was still course by nature but so much softer and glossier!  It really makes a difference!  I highly recommend it if you can afford it.  Like I said in the title, the only thing that keeps this from being 5 stars is the insanely expensive price.

review/summary: Great Cat Food!
review/text: My cats love this food.  It is higher calorie than the Organix Adult Indoor Feline Dry Cat Food since it is formulated for kittens.  I mix the two types together but give them more of the indoor formula in an effort to keep their weight down.  I put a mixture of 1/3 cup of these foods for their lunch and dinner in the MultiVet SlimCat Interactive Toy and Food Dispenser so that they're forced to eat slower and to get a little excercise.  This system has worked really well.  I put the SlimCat balls on separate platters (that have a rim) for each cat so that they don't move the balls throughout the kitchen and eat off the floor.  The balls stay on the platter and keep the area clean.  I use the Automatic Pet Feeder 6-Meal Timer Food Dispenser With LCD Display for their morning meals so that I can sleep in.  This system works for me.  So glad that I found these wonderful products on Amazon!

review/summary: Great deal for Organic cat dry food! However...
review/text: I've bought the smaller package of the same cat food at the store before. It was kind of expensive but I wanted to keep buying organic food for my beloved kitty. And I found this deal on Amazon. I was going to keep buying some kind of organic cat food anyways and I didn't have to drive store to store to find the organic cat food that I can buy locally. So it was the perfect solution for me!<br /><br />I wrote this about 3 months ago. Now my cat won't eat much just with the dry cat food by itself. That started over a month ago. I thought he got sick so I took him to a vet. She said, she doesn't see any problems. Now I read all the reviews and it all makes sense. He just don't like this cat food. He still asks for more food after I feed this food. So I needed to buy organic wet canned food to mix so that he'll eat something at least. I mean I want something really healthy for my kitty to live longer, but it concerns me if he doesn't eat because of food... But I don't wanna go back to the junky cat food with lots of bad stuff that he loves... I don't know what to do!

review/text: BAY VIEW HERRING IN CREAM SAUCE tastes exactly like the herring used to eat as a child!  I decided to get the 65 OUNCE JAR, because it saves about 12% over getting the same herring in two smaller jars, also on sale here on Amazon. The herring, the sour cream, and the enclosed onion slices, are all in just about the same proportion that still sells at New York City supermarkets...but at a far lesser price.  Totally scrumptious, totally -- dare I say it? -- divine!<br /><br />It's fascinating -- that the Vita Herring that I ate growing up in New York, and this Wisconsin-made Bay View Herring, taste exactly the same -- both SO yummy!  A culinary leap for seeing everyone for what they are -- a fellow human being -- and the similarities in all people, and not the differences!  This is a certainty, proved by the taste, and definitely an added bonus for this yummy stuff!<br /><br />I bought some other herring, (in wine sauce), but, though it was tasty, did not like it as much.  Needless to say, I still have much of the herring-in-wine-sauce left.....but not much of this wonderful herring-with-sour-cream-(and onion rings), left!  No problem, I guess...just put the other herring in this big jar, and add extra sour cream and onions!<br /><br />After the fish is finished, this LARGE, (glass!) bowl, (cleaned and scrubbed, of course, with soap and with clorox), will make a wonderful new home for my little betta fish!  But, if I could only<br />keep magically refilling it....with herring and buy a SECOND jar for my pet.....!  Oh well, take some out / And pass the Herring....<br />It's delicious / And gives thought / For dreaming and daring / At least for me / And others / Of imagination / Too! / If you like<br />sour cream and herring / Of any other brand / You'll like this one -- true!<br /><br />Happy eating!

These are perfect because they are bite sized.  I don't even mind sharing one or two pieces. LOL.  M&M got this one right.  I also like the peanut butter ones.  But the mint ones are amazing.  The combination is just right.  Sometimes when mint is combined with dark chocolate, one flavor tends to overpower the other.  Not with these.  The dark chocolate is rich and tastes like quality dark chocolate. Not all dark chocolates are created equal.  If you are a fan of the chocolate and mint,  you will love these.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Stash Trio - misleading
review/text: Be aware that the title and the whole listing is wrong, I didn't receive six sets, or 1 lb worth of tea, I received 1 gift set.<br /><br />That being said I and my family drink tea daily. Between the three of us we go through about a gallon a day, usually a plain variety of orange Pekoe and/or Black tea. However, I like to mix it up and try new teas, and I fell in love with the quality stash teas after my boyfriend bought me a huge variety pack, so when I'm looking for something new I tend to gravitate towards the Stash brand.<br /><br />As soon as you remove the cellophane you get a very inviting aroma from each box, I tried 2 out of the 3 both hot and cold, and 1 (the cranberry) I only drank cold.<br /><br />Cinnamon Vanilla<br />I found this to be very sweet, so I would suggest cutting your sugar back by 25% - this one was my least favorite<br /><br />Warm: I preferred it warm over iced, which is rare. The flavors are much fuller while it's warm and the aromatics are better appreciated that way too,I tried it first with out milk, it was okay, almost reminiscent of warm apple cider sans the apple, after I added milk and it transformed into a liquid cinnamon bun! That was a delight!...at first. It was one of those things that the more you drank it the less you enjoyed it, the cinnamon began to overwhelm you and the sweet notes became clawing.. - My mother didn't like it plain or with milk.<br /><br />Cold: It's just shy of "Okay" while cold. the flavor's become very sharp and one noted it still kind of reminds me of an apple cider due to it's predominate sweet and cinnamon flavor, I haven't tried it cold with milk yet. later I mixed it 50/50 with our regular brew hoping to cut the overwhelming flavors, it didn't help any.<br /><br />Pumpkin Spice.<br />the pumpkin spice was my second favorite,<br />Warm: it was quite similar to the cinnamon vanilla as far as it being very aromatic but much more balanced, the clove dominated and while it didn't taste anything like a pumpkin pie (it contains no actual pumpkin) it did have a nice earthy notes to it.  It was easy to enjoy this one both warm and cold although I also preferred this over being warm. I added milk while it was still warm and preferred it with out. The milk didn't really compliment the flavors.<br /><br />Cold: The same thing happen with the cinnamon vanilla with it being cold, the notes are a little sharper, but it was still really enjoyable<br /><br />Cranberry Pomegranite.<br />I only drank this one cold, as I'm not big on warm fruits, I made a half gallon using 2 bags of stash and 2 bags of black tea, this gave it a nice fruity hint while still being a full bodied tea. I enjoyed this one the most, probably because I enjoy fruited teas over spiced teas, but also because the taste was enough to enjoy it, but not so much that you were overwhelmed with strong flavors.

review/summary: Decent, not great.
review/text: I used to think this stuff was the best coffee around. Until I started trying various other brands, and grinding my own.  To which, I came to realize that at best, this stuff is average.<br /><br />Slightly above the canned stuff in the grocery store, thats it.  The other reviewer is right, it is "Nutty" in flavor, so you really need to love nuts or this one will turn you off. Secondly, it is fairly light roasted.  We tend to have more enjoyment from medium-dark to dark roasts.  This one doesn't have enough kick.<br /><br />This is a blend, which isn't really a good thing for coffee freaks. I tend to like beans from specific regions in the world, so blends really mess up my taste enjoyment.  Blends are generally for people that aren't too serious about Coffee.

review/summary: Izze tastes great!
review/text: My teens and their friends drink regular soda pop by the gallon! They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.<br /><br />I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy. I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found Izze.<br /><br />I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling clementine soda. Nothing beats an icy, cold Clementine Izzy on a picnic. The clementine flavor goes well with a nice thick sandwich and a handful of chips, but it is also great just by itself.<br /><br />My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop! I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!<br /><br />If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze.

review/summary: Just a wonderful product!
review/text: Izze Sparkling Clementine Soda is like a bite into fresh fruit! It's made of a mixture of different juices including grape, lemon, orange and apple. Somehow, the combination comes out to be like a section of the freshest clementine bursting with flavor.<br /><br />This is certainly a nutritional step-up from regular soda, but be aware that this does have sugar in it -- of course, there's sugar in all fruits. Enjoy Izze's great flavor and refreshment, but enjoy it in moderation.<br /><br />Excellent product!

review/summary: Great Tasting!
review/text: This is a very good drink.  Tasty and not syrupy I really enjoyed the flavor.  I tried the Sparkling Clementine.  It is funny when I tasted the drink I thought, yup, that tastes like a Clementine.  Then I looked at the back for the ingredients.  There are juices (from concentrate) from White Grape, Apple, Lemon and Orange Juice.  No Clementine.  Funny enough it really is a nice flavor.<br /><br />Izze also offers this beverage in a just over 8 oz. a can.  The drink does not have caffeine or added sugars so I don't feel bad about drinking it.  It isn't overly sweet so it adds a bit of energy rather then making me tired.<br /><br />This is not a hydration beverage as much as a tasty treat.  It is not unhealthy so you don't need to feel guilty by downing one or two of these in a day.  Not calorie free but not too bad either.  The taste is not overly sweet.  I have heard from others who consider it bitter.  I disagree.  I think this bitter taste is from tastebuds too used to sugary sodas.<br /><br />A great drink, a good company and thumbs up in my book

review/summary: Love love love this Izze
review/text: As a gourmet soda lover and shameless glutton, I've dropped a good amount of coin at my local Wholefoods trying out different beverages... well.. at least the ones that don't cost $5 or more per bottle. On sale, one bottle of Izze is about $1.50.<br /><br />It's fabulous! The soda does taste like clementine. It's all natural, sparkly, and so refreshing. I remembered trying the canned version of this (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014X5O1C">IZZE Fortified Sparkling Juice, Clementine, 8.4-Ounce Cans</a>) and not being impressed. The bottled version tastes much better. It's got different ingredient ratios and a different formulation: sparkling water, white grape juice concentrate, orange juice concentrate, lemon juice concentrate, natural flavor, gum, acacia, ester gum, beta carotene. Drink it ice cold though, otherwise it doesn't taste that great.<br /><br />Sugar is a bit high, with 120 calories per bottle. 70% juice. One bottle is very high in Vitamin A and gives you 100% of your daily needs. Both are astoundingly good. Highly highly recommended.

review/summary: Slightly Carbonated Fruit Juice. Excellent.
review/text: Several weeks ago I discovered Izze fruit drinks starting with the Blackberry variety. It was so good I tried the Pomegranate. That was good too, so now I have a four-pack of the Clementine variety. It tastes like a weak orange soda with a good sharp tartness. I like it much better than the typical orange soda pop and it's made with 70% fruit juices and no added sugars. It's just like having a slightly carbonated fruit juice rather than darkly-colored sugar water. That's my kind of drink. Excellent.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
