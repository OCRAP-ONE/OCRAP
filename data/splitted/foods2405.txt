review/summary: Good Green Tea
review/text: I just purchased this tea after using Salada Decaffinated Green Tea.  This is a good product.  It has a fold pouch containing 4 tea bags.  Take one out and you can fold down the pouch to reseal it. I have to admit that I do prefer the Salada brand over Bigelow, however.  One advatage Bigelow has is it organic, Salada is not.

review/summary: What green?
review/text: Hmmm. Maybe it's just me but this "green" tea brews brown. I snapped up a box of this at my local supermarket since I didn't have time to drive across town to the asian market for my usual brand. The taste of this is fine but it does seem to taste more like a mild black tea. Maybe this is a bad box or maybe the decaffeinating process has effected the cathechins and thus the color? I don't drink this stuff for the flavor or color. I want to be antioxidized to the max so I think I'll be buying my other brand of tea next (it's packaged in Japan and not the US for whatever it's worth.)

I thought maybe it was something else but I stopped drinking it anyway until the headache went away.  Once I resumed drinking, the headaches came back.  I have since stopped drinking the tea and now I am back to normal.  IDK if I had a bad batch or maybe it just doesn't work well with my body but now I have 39 tea bags that I can't use, lol.

review/summary: Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems
review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

review/summary: Healthy choice for dog w/ food allergies/sensitive stomach
review/text: My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/summary: dogs,too,are what they eat
review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

review/summary: Finally, some peace
review/text: Our dog has tried several foods, including expensive vet brands, and has been treated for ear infections, skin infections, and was constantly scratching and licking. We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking, "Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!"  I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

I looked on Amazon.com and saw the "Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions" dog food.

review/text: Even our vet could not cure the red bumps on my dog's skin.  The rash and excoriation was unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical steroid spray.  Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/summary: Low Residue
review/text: My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy.  Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me.  The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it.  It doesn't make his breath smell.  I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food.

review/summary: Excellent! My dog's skin looks amazing and he loves this food!
review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/text: I started a LID for my dog when after a regular yearly check up, my vet noticed that her paws were tinged a redish color. The vet said that it was probably an allergy to something in her food and suggested a limited ingredient diet. We have been using this food for about 4 months now and we have noticed remarkable results. She no longer constantly licks her feet and they are returning to their normal color. Worked perfectly for our dog!!

review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies
review/text: My dog is allergic to wheat and grain products. It would manifest as constant nasty ear inflamations. My vet prescribed a dog food that is only available from vets but after 3 months I saw no improvement.<br /><br />Finally I researched on my own and tried Wellness Simple Solutions and after 3 months I noticed that her ear problems subsided. I supplement her evening meals with the Wellness Simple Solutions dry food and she loves it.<br /><br />Compared with the stuff the vet prescribed, which looked like a waxy tube coming out of the can, the Wellness Simple Solutions canned dog food looks and smells like real food. It contains no wheat, corn, soy, dairy, or eggs and yet is high in nutrients.<br /><br />The first ingredient listed on the back of the can is duck and it states " This is a naturally preserved product". Considering that, I am very happy that the best by dates average about 2 years out because I keep extra dog food on hand in case of an emergency.

review/text: Wellness is an incredible food.  I have used it for both of my dobes for almost 7 months.  They were shedding before I switched to this brand but no more.  Since the switch almost 7 months ago, their coats are amazing - like silk and I have no shedding at all.  I have one dobe with a sensitive stomach so switched him over to this formula when I saw it came out.  He loves it - sure, its a little pricy but so worth it - no loose stools, no throwups and no shedding - I get comments on them all the time about how beautiful their coats are!

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

review/summary: False advertising!
review/text: Ella's Kitchen should be ashamed for false advertising. I was really surprised to see a fruit-veggie product like this one had so much calcium (30%) on the package compared to most of the other baby fruits out there (usually 0-2% unless veggies or yogurt's added in) and chose this over other products, thinking the extra calcium would be worth the extra $ for my baby in the long run. When you check it against Ella's website, it's only 2%! Same goes for all the other stage 1 Ella's fruits (carrots/apples/parships: 20% calcium on package but 0% on the website, peaches and bananas 10% calcium on package vs. 0% on website all the same serving size) -- there were other differences too in protein, iron, etc. It does cost a lot more than some of the other organic baby fruits out there and tastes awful. If your baby is just as content with the other less expensive organic baby fruits out there, go with the cheaper alternative because nutrition wise, Ella's no better!<br /><br />What a disgusting marketing ploy by Ella's Kitchen to get parents to choose their products because it is falsely more nutritious when it's the same as other organic baby fruits in terms of nutritional value.

review/summary: Good, but not quite the Best
review/text: I don't think I've had steel cut oats that I could describe as "bad", but I have to say that these don't quite rise to the level of McCann's.  The Arrowhead product is lots, cheaper, however, so overall it might be a better bet unless you want the absolute best.<br /><br />The differences are subtle.  For some reason I get a larger volume of cooked outs from 1 cup of McCann's than I do from Arrowhead, and the McCann's has a more of the distinctive "nutty" flavor that makes steel cut oats so delicious.<br /><br />The two products actually have different cooking instructions.  McCann's calls for 30 minutes of cooking once the oats are put into boiling water.  Arrowhead calls for 12 minutes of cooking after the oats are put into cold water and brought to a boil.  Cooked that way the Arrowhead oats are markedly inferior, but cooked the McCann's way they get much better.<br /><br />I'm still on a quest to find oats as good as I had in England at a couple of fancy places in London.  Any ideas?

review/text: Being a dedicated oatmeal lover, I bought this product to test out the steel cut variety and I am here to tell you rolled oats are but a pasty memory.<br /><br />The instructions on the box tell you to use water/oat ratio of 2/1 but I mix them 3/1 when I steam them which takes about an hour. Usually I use a 4/1 mix and leave them overnight in their bowl sitting in warm water in a Presto Kettle which is the best way to wake up to breakfast. You could do the same thing in a crock pot.<br /><br />I rated this product 4 instead of 5 because part of the price includes the packaging. If you have a health food store nearby you may find a better deal in the bulk bins.

review/text: Great value and oh so good for you.  I cook these on the stove top for my three boys 3x a week.  They love them.  No kidding!  I cook them traditionally with water (not milk as 1 of my kids is sensitive to milk) and serve with maple syrup and the cream on top of the raw milk we get.  I also cook these oats with home made chicken stock...to make chicken oatmeal soup (instead of chicken noodle soup).  My boys gobble them up in no time flat.  Even my soon to be one year old loves this soup.  To kick it up a notch, add chopped broccoli during the last 5-10 min of cooking.  The flavor is amazing.<br /><br />You will find that soaking these steel cut oats in water  for a hour or more will speed its cooking process.

review/summary: Takes a little time, but really worth it!
review/text: This stuff is fab!  If you're a big fan of the mushy oatmeal, this is not for you.  I've always bought the 'old fashioned' oats that you're supposed to cook for 5 minutes & just cooked them for about 90 seconds - I hate that glue-like texture they get when they're cooked too long.  A bunch of people are talking about soaking them forever & stuff, but I've found just following the directions on the box (bring to a boil stirring constantly, then cover & simmer for about 12 minutes, stirring occasionally) works just fine.  They have a lot more flavor that rolled oats, and if you're adding raisins or cranberries or anything, you can just toss 'em in about 3 or 4 minutes before the oats are done & they'll be all nice & plumped up when it's time to eat your oatmeal.  They re-heat well, so if you're not a big fan of getting up & cooking first thing in the morning, just fix a big batch & nuke single servings as you need them.  If you LIKE your oatmeal mushy (there must be SOME people out there who do, or they'd never be able to sell that nasty instant stuff), maybe the soaking thing would work to soften them up, though.<br /><br />A note about the packaging: I alternated between buying these & another brand - because the other one came in a bag; these come in a box that's 35% post-consumer recycled cardboard.  I'm a big fan of buying post-consumer recycled stuff, in general, but I was worried that the oats would have a cardboard-y taste.  As it turns out, there's a bag inside the box, so I worried for nothing.  Nobody said anything one way or the other in their reviews, so I thought I'd throw that in for anybody else who was looking for it.  I don't know what the bag's made of, though; it looks like plastic, but I suppose it could be cellulose or something that's biodegradable.  At any rate, the bag keeps the oats nice & fresh.

Buying pre-milled or dissovleable cereal was fine at first when I was testing to see what she would like. Now that I know oatmeal is a huge hit, I buy Arrowhead Mills Organic Steel Cut Oats and mill them up myself. It takes very little time and saves me a mint! She enjoys it plain or mixed with bannana or apple. It freezes and reheats perfectly for those who make batches to freeze. I cook this up and puree the fruit of choice and put one half oatmeal and one half fruit puree in the silicone freezer trays. Baby and I are very glad I found this!<br /><br />For the adult review, yes it tastes great. I am the type that usually has to doctor oatmeal quite a bit before it suits me - I don't put anything in this. Its a staple in my home now!

review/summary: Other cooking options
review/text: I haven't eaten as much McCann's or Arrowhead Mills as I've eaten Bob's Red Mill, and while I like Bob's just fine--very nutty--I'm going to go back and try the others again. (It *is* too bad McCann's costs so much more.) For cooking, an overnight soak in cold water makes for a pretty quick stovetop cookup (10-15 minutes, stirring, on low after turning back from a boil). What we usually do, however, is easier still--put the oats, raisins and water in our rice cooker (Zojirushi) the night before, and set its timer for the next morning--works like a charm.  (Skip the raisins if you like, but it may be better to avoid milk in a rice cooker--better added to the bowl.)

review/summary: Fills the bill but less flavor than the Irish
review/text: These Arrowhead Mills organic steel cut oats are offered at a great price here on Amazon. But they don't have the rich deep flavor of the Irish Steel Cut oats. My husband thinks these Arrowhead Mills taste "funny" and he refuses to eat them. He urges me to go back to the "regular kind" (which means, any other kind than Arrowhead Mills). I eat these myself but they are a little bland. Also, please note, the instructions say to cook for just 6 minutes. I find that they need the usual 20-22 minutes cooking time, to produce the desired consistency of steel cut oats. They taste and look much better after the 20-minutes cooking than they did with the instructions-recommended shorter time. I am just waiting to finish consuming these and then will go back to the better tasting steel cut oats.

review/summary: Best oatmeal with the least effort
review/text: We've probably tried a score of brands and types of oatmeal from long-cooking steel-cut to "instant".  About five or six years ago we "discovered" Arrowhead Mills Organic Hot Cereal, Steel Cut Oats and we stopped our research.  It's perfect every time.  In eleven to twelve minutes I can serve up a dense, slightly nutty/crunchy textured oatmeal that keeps you feeling satisfied for hours.  Dark brown sugar is on the table to add as you please.  Our granddaughters became instant fans, too, and the youngest calls it "Mermer Oakmeal,"  (I'll be a little sad when she learns to read the word correctly.)<br /><br />For years now, and throughout the year, I prepare half the box, two cups of oatmeal with four cups of water, and store leftovers in the fridge.  It reheats in the microwave in about thirty seconds so, If we don't have breakfast guests, my husband and I have three days of "pre-made" oatmeal.<br /> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL4E0">Arrowhead Mills Organic Hot Cereal, Steel Cut Oats, 24-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)</a>  is not always easy to find in supermarkets, so I've been ordering four boxes a month on Amazon's Subscribe&Save which saves time, effort and money, to boot!

review/text: Good quality and reasonable price.  Worth buying in quantity of 4 boxes if you are sure you like steel cut oats and are looking for a whole grain product.  They take longer to cook and are chewier than regular oatmeal.  If you are new to steel cut oats, I suggest ordering only 1 box to see if your family likes it.We like it with cinnamon, dates, and brown sugar.

review/summary: Healthy and tastes great!
review/text: These steel cut oats taste great and are easy to cook.  I will say that I've noticed the quick cook oats can come out a bit dry so I personally prefer these old fashioned steel cut oats.  The old fashioned oats do take about 40 minutes to cook, but luckily they keep very well in the refrigerator.  So, I typically make a large batch on Sunday for use throughout the week.  Also, they do taste a bit bland, but adding a little apple juice, agave, honey or stevia to the batch can help soften the graininess.

review/text: I've been eating this brand of oatmeal for over 4 years now. I've tried other brands but this one is the best. It cooks fast, in about 10-15 minutes, and is incredibly healthy. If you've never eaten steel cut oats before, the texture can take some getting used to: it's not as gooey as rolled oats and 100 times healthier. Very high in fiber. Add some honey or fresh fruit and half a cup of this everyday to improve your health.

review/summary: Delicious Steel Cut Oats!
review/text: I first ordered Arrowhead Mills Organic Steel Cut Oats about 4 months ago. I searched all over and compared many products and reviews. After my first order, I was sold and added this product to my "Subscribe and Save" account!<br /><br />The flavor is delicious, the texture very nice, and the oats have a naturally buttery flavor! It only takes 12 minutes to cook, and I eat them 5-6 times a week for breakfast. I added some honey, blueberries, walnuts and 1 Tbsp of Flax Seed Oil to my bowl. After trying these oats, I cannot go back to plain oatmeal, because that stuff just tastes mushy, flat and one dimensional.<br /><br />I will be buying these oats for as long as they are around! Oh, and the free shipping is super fast too, so save your money.

review/summary: Good product
review/text: That's my first attempt try cut oats (rather than rolled). The order was delivered (by Amazon) quickly and undamaged, all's good. I combined it with sunflower seeds to get free shipping. The stuff is a bit different from the rolled oats I'm used to: if you try them raw, they're not tasty at all (rolled are quite pleasant: I used to mix them with yogurt and eat w/o cooking; these cut oats, otoh, raw taste like nothing, like dry cardboard). But if you cook them, it's another story: the consistency is less like glue, they're chewier and have a bit of a nutty flavour -- goes great with sunflower seeds, which I've recently discovered and put them now in the oatmeal all the time; it's a great combination, almost crunchy.<br /><br />One thing you need to know is that the cooking directions on the box are really incorrect: it says 2-to-1 water; bring to boil; then simmer 10-12 mins. Unless I'm doing something wrong, you'll need more water, and you'll have to simmer at least twice as long. Also, the box says a serving is a quarter cup. Come on. If you're bird, that's a serving, yes. Not being a bird, I like a big bowl of this stuff, six to eight heaped tablespoons of it dry; that's nearly 3/4 of a cup, I think -- and half the pot of water. If it still has water when ready, it's better than the opposite (burned and stuck to the walls: tastes bad plus a lot of homework cleaning the pot); and if this extra-wet condition happens, I simply turn it off and let it sit a while: it sucks in the rest of water itself, w/o cooking. 'course you can't do it all in five minutes, so I do it well ahead of time. It's not an instanteneous product: you gotta have some half an hour before you eat it.<br /><br />But all right: what matters is whether the stuff is good, and it is (if I discover otherwise, I'll post an update to this review). When my new stash runs out, I'll reorder, so this will be a long-term record.<br /><br />Added on 07/18/2011: Even though I did mention above that this is not an instant product, I underestimated the length of time required to prepare it well: it's much longer than I thought. You _can_ get it to the typical glueey consistency with an awful lot of water absorption, but it literally takes hours to get it to that state. What I do now is do it at night for the next morning: I boil water and add only three tablespoons of the stuff, bring to boil again, turn it off after a minute or so, and leave overnight. Then it's good. Otherwise it's too dry and too much unabsorbed water.

review/summary: Perfect breakfast food
review/text: They're healthy and tasty, what more could you ask for?<br /><br />After reading an article about steel cut oats a few years back I decided to try some, and now they are my staple breakfast food - I never tire of them.<br /><br />I haven't been able to tell much of a difference between these and McCann's, but then I flavor my oatmeal.<br /><br />They do take a bit of time to cook, but it's simple to get around this - I just cook a week's worth at a time, and microwave each morning's portion for a minute - it tastes great that way.<br /><br />My recipe:<br />300 grams steel cut oats<br />7 cups water<br />3 tablespoons golden molasses<br />1 box frozen dried lychees<br /><br />Add molasses and lychees to water and bring to a boil (sprinkle a few grains of oatmeal in to seed the water and stop it from getting superheated). After it boils, add the steel cut oats, reduce the temperature, and simmer for nine minutes, stirring occasionally. Take off the stove and let it sit for 15-20 minutes, then put it in the fridge.<br /><br />You can adjust the mushiness of the oatmeal by adjusting the sitting time, I like it not too mushy.<br /><br />Lasts 7-10 days in the fridge, assuming you just get your daily dose out and put the pot back in immediately.

review/text: We've been experimenting with various oatmeals and this one, hands down, is the best we've found.  It's nutty, chewy and tastes good.  I don't even add salt.<br /><br />One caveat is to let it cook for longer than the package calls for, and add a bit more water.  After 20 minutes, it's still pretty soupy, but 30 minutes gives the perfect texture. For two servings, I use 1/2 cup oats to 1 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes.  I usually add one T of brown sugar and a handful of dried blueberries, dried cranberries or raisins to the water before cooking.  The moisture plumps the dried fruit beautifully and the sugar adds just a hint of sweetness. Slosh on some low fat milk and it's good to go.  This is the perfect breakfast food!

review/summary: THESE COOKIES ARE THE BEST!
review/text: For 28 years I have told my husband about being a little girl where every Christmas I was looking forward to going to my Grandma's home in PA where she had these great bubble lights on her tree and this Danish can of Danish cookies, that I loved (No, she was not Danish but had great taste!.) My husband being of Scandinavian American ancestry, never had these great cookies? I have come across them in the past, but they were not the real thing from Denmark.<br /><br />He surprised me on my Birthday, with the REAL DANISH cookies, although they did arrive AFTER my birthday, they were just as I remembered them and a lot of cookies! LOL.  Being a child, I used to dunk them also in hot chocolate, therefore, being an adult, I tried them with coffee.<br />EVEN BETTER!  They are also terrific for Tea Time (for herbal tea drinkers).<br /><br />The only thing negative I can say is they are addicting because they are delicious (as they may be butter cookies but they are light) and there are a lot of them!  So I am offering samples to friends and neighbors.  Otherwise, I could eat them all in about 4 weeks as they are that YUMMY!  Not a SOFT cookie, a hard cookie with a lot of flavor and light (nut buttery tasting).  Simply terrific.

review/summary: Knock off Danish cookies!
review/text: This is not the true Danish brand for sugar cookies. The sugar crystals looked and tasted like sand granules. The cookies were bland not rich and buttery. I will not buy this brand ever again. Thank goodness Costco had the authentic brand!

review/summary: A splendid Christmas present
review/text: These cookies made a splendid Christmas present for relatives who lived too far for us to visit for the holidays.  They were high in quality, delivered promptly, and helped add cheer to a Christmas party.  Everyone who tried them told us that they enjoyed the cookies, and so people felt our presence at the party even though we could not attend.

review/summary: these cookies take the cake!
review/text: I just love these cookies - the texture is somewhere between a sugar cookie and shortbread but with a nice buttery note that is unlike either of the others. The best I could describe the flavor is sort of like pound cake, but in crisp cookie form. Perfect with tea, coffee, milk or even just by themselves.<br /><br />These tins are great to give as gifts during the holidays too; I've never met anyone young or old that didn't like them. They are well packaged with the little muffin liners so rarely a broken one and they keep for a really long time. The tin seals nice and tight and is reusable.<br /><br />Pleased with this product and happy to recommend.

review/summary: Favorite cookies of all time
review/text: I think these are the best cookies ever.  I only wish I could buy them year 'round.  I can only find them<br />during the holiday season.  My 98 year old mother loves these cookies also.  I bought this tin to give to her<br />for Christmas.  They are already gone.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The metal cover has severely disformed. And most of the cookies inside have been crushed into small pieces. Shopping experience is awful. I'll never buy it online again.

review/summary: Legal addication
review/text: I generally get these at Costco--but they only handle them at Christmas.  As I bit the last of the Christmas lot I had already started withdrawal anxiety.  Luckily I had remembered by secret name and Amazon came to my rescue.  Three-a-day is all you need to continue to function "normally."  More than that leads to a phone call from Mayor Bloomberg.
