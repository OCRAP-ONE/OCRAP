review/summary: Completely worth the price.
review/text: Is Wellness relatively expensive? Yes. Is it worth every penny? ABSOLUTELY, yes.<br /><br />As new cat owners, my husband and I wanted to make sure our two newly adopted cats would get the best care possible. After spending hours researching pet foods on the internet, I was completely shocked (and disgusted!) to find out how terrible the cheap grocery store brands of food really are. It didn't take long for us to settle on Wellness because of its premium ingredients and stellar reputation.<br /><br />Thankfully, our cats LOVE this food. They're happy, and we're happy because it's so good for them! We gladly spend the extra money to ensure the health and well being of our two furry children. They love the turkey, chicken, and turkey/salmon varieties, which are all grain free. Turkey is their favorite, which is why I'm posting the review here. :)<br /><br />If you want your cats to eat great food, try Wellness. We are SO glad we did!

review/summary: Pricey, but well worth it
review/text: There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled "Core," is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water ("no more than 78%" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.  The Wellness canned food is fantastic and might save your kitty's life!

review/text: I feed several Savannah Cats, all of which can be very picky eaters. Everyone wants something different and if I change anything about their diet they get upset stomachs.<br /><br />I bought Wellness food trying to get them all to eat the same thing. I was simply amazed. As I gave it to them one by one they loved it. Even my 2 biggest picky eaters ate it right up. I watched closely for any upset stomachs and nothing. They all accepted the food with no issues.<br /><br />I was a little worried at first as to how much they ate as it could be expensive, but within a few days they leveled themselves out. I am just thrilled with the food and their reactions. I will promote this food to all my new homes. The food smells good enough to eat. Hum, wonder how my husband would like to try a new dish tonight :)

review/summary: Great Option For Diabetic Cats!
review/text: My 14 year-old cat was diagnosed with Diabetes and Chronic Renal Failure earlier this year; it was devastating. I had to administer insulin shots to him twice a day and twice he had hypo-glycemia due to the enormous challenge of balancing insulin levels. Worse, he was miserable and wary of me.<br /><br />At 16 lbs, he was overweight even for a large frame cat so I promptly began an intensive internet research (agree with the earlier poster who cautions against the foods prescribed by vets and sold in grocery stores) and after narrowing the field of high-protein pet foods, decided to try wet food. I was nervous because I had been guilty of feeding my baby delicious, awful-for-him dry foods (I was clueless) so I had no idea how long the transition to Wellness wet would take.<br /><br />There was no transition: He loved the food immediately and the switch was painless. Best, he lost 4 lbs in about 6 months, his blood sugar has stabilized and he's off insulin, hopefully permanently.<br /><br />Wellness isn't cheap, but when compared with the cost of losing a beloved furry member of the family too soon, the price is well-justified!<br /><br />ps. Maximillian's favorites are the chicken and the turkey. Vary for best results!

review/summary: Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food
review/text: When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie

review/summary: Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health
review/text: The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, petfoodratings.net. What you'll find is that even the supposed "high-end" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like "liver flavor" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.

review/summary: Awesome Cat Food
review/text: Being new to raising kittens, I have tried a variety of canned foods in recent months.  Although my kittens readily took to the Fancy Feast brand, it is not the most healthy of foods - my biggest concern being the by-product content.  I thought I would never get them off of that kitty krack!  However, MUCH to my surprise, they absolutely love this food and ate it readily the first time.  And the best part is that it is a very healthy food - no grains, no by-products.  There is a little gravy in the bottom of the can so I put a little bit of water in, give it a swirl, put it on top of the food - and whalah - instant broth and MORE water for my babies to lap up which is so vital for avoiding UTI's.<br /><br />I just can't say enough - good - about this product.  Thank you, Wellness.  My kittens are happy and that's all that matters!!!

review/summary: My Cats Wouldn't Touch It
review/text: A short background on the eating habits of my two cats, one is super finicky and the other cat will eat just about anything. When even my non-picky cat wouldn't touch any of it, I knew something was not right with this food. They refused to eat any of it. I like the premise behind the food, all natural and grain-free, but I am going to have to go back to the prior food my cats like. Hopefully my local animal shelter can make use of the food for their cats, if they even eat it.

review/summary: Great food, but...
review/text: ...lousy packaging/storage.  While the food itself is wonderful and the cat loves it, Amazon really made a mess of my order.  When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.

review/summary: My cats now love it!
review/text: I have two cats, one under 1 year old and the other is 4 years old. After researching about proper cat diets, I realized that they needed a good grain-free meaty canned food. Wellness fit the bill. The younger cat ate up the chicken flavor instantly and loved it! The older cat however, refused to eat it at first. She was used to eating dry kibbles and occasionally canned fancy feast. She kept refusing to eat the Wellness and I caved in and let her finish the bag of kibbles. Only when we didn't have any other food than the canned wellness did she approach it. So once she was good and hungry, and the younger cat was in another room, she crept out and started eating it!! Now she loves it and eats the chicken flavor with no problem. I haven't tried out the other flavors, but since I had such a hard time getting her to come around to eating it in the first place, I've been feeding them both the chicken flavor exclusively. If your cat won't eat Wellness, be patient and get rid of their previous food so when they get hungry they only have one choice. Mixing the old food with the new one wasn't as successful as just waiting it out. Their coats are super shiny and they are both at a healthy weight on a wellness diet.

review/summary: Better than most canned food but still BAD
review/text: I have a cat who had serious intestinal issues. I needed a canned food that was grain free and also I need a protein that was not chicken - I had to start my cat on a novel protein. I bought this on the recommendation of a veterinarian (L. Pierson) on her web site, for so called "acceptable" canned food, because it is grain free. However if you read the ingredients list, it contains other ingredients that the same veterinarian says are allergenic to cats (e.g. carageenan). Also, even though its name claims it is "Turkey", (the turkey was supposed to be the novel protein for me) the ingredients list lists chicken and chicken parts as its 2nd, 3rd and 4th ingredients. It also has the same type of thickeners, fillers, and "flavoring" that all the other run of the mill canned pet food has.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 3 star rating (because it doesn't contain grains), but as I typed my review I was reminded of the deception and it made me change it to a 2 star.

After a few days of Google research and reading pet food negatives and positives, I decided on a mix of Wellness both wet and the dry exclusively for my two rescue/shelter kitties based on reviews and availability. Price was not a deciding factor. After 1-1/2 years, they still gobble it down and I'm pleased to report both kitties mental and physical health to be outstanding with shiney, smooth coats, regular bowel movements, and healthy, energetic activity. I contribute this good fortune mostly to their diet of Wellness and a loving home environment although my billfold wouldn't mind if it were a bit cheaper. In my experience, Wellness has been outstanding.

review/summary: Five Solstice Gum
review/text: Five solstice gum is my favorite gum of all time.  Even my dentist was impressed that I started having less and less cavities b/c I chew them after coffee/lunch!  However, there was one order where the gum was stale, so that's why I'm going to have to leave it as a 3 star.  It didnt' say it was expired, but the gum color was tinted a not-as-dark green and when I bit into it, it was very soft, almost seemed moist like you're biting into butter/marshmallow.  Otherwise, given that you don't end up unlucky like me, you're definitely getting a great deal here for great gum!<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />MC

review/text: I hate over paying for those three packs in the grocery store. I also no longer live next to a Costco. So this is a great option for me. Since this is my preferred gum and I can seldom find it in the store this is definitely a win for me. I will definitely purchase again when I need a refresh in stock.

review/text: 5 gum tastes so good!  The best thing about it is that it lasts longer than most gums.  I can leave it in my mouth for a half hour before it loses taste.  I must say though, after 10 packs, the same flavor gets old.  I would recommend the mint variety pack over this.  Unfortunately, gum on Amazon is on the expensive side.  You don't save that much over buying a 3 pack.

review/summary: This is one of the best hot sauces you can get
review/text: I like hot sauces for the flavor more than for the heat.  This is the best tasting habanero hot sauce I have ever had (to date).  This sauce does come packing heat, but the flavor is still there and does not ever get drowned out in the heat.<br /><br />It has a lovely blend of flavors that result in a sauce that is more about being a useful sauce than about showcasing the flavors of the peppers or attacking you with heat.  While this particular one is the "Fiery Hot" version of the regular sauce (and indeed comes packing heat) this is still a relatively mild Habanero sauce in my opinion but it is still quite a bit hotter than the regular version of this sauce.  For those who just want a sauce that makes people cry, you will do better elsewhere.  For those who want to use it for food, this is about as good as it gets.<br /><br />This sauce has been a staple in my house for the last 3 years since I found it, and seems excellent with absolutely anything.  Top recommended in my book.

review/summary: Tasty Hot !
review/text: My wife and I found Marie Sharps while on a month long trip to Belize .It was difficult to find a table anywhere in the country without it.<br />And after a few days we knew why .This is the very best hot sauce we have ever had !<br />This is from a person who 20 years ago wanted to start a store built on one thing hot sauce !Hot Condiments from all over the world.<br />With the Internet we each have that store right in our own homes.<br />Back to Marie sharps this is unique ! Garlic carrot lime all combine so wonderfully with the Habanero pepper to offer sublime heat and flavor.<br />This is hot ! but it is not out to destroy you hot it is gimme more hot while the sweat drips from your brow.<br />This is nothing at all like Tabascos new product while that is very good and I use it a lot . It is more like Malinda's ( Costa Rica )<br />It was told to us that they, Marie Sharp and Malinda were related and each went their own way .Not sure if that is true but there is a slight similarity in the sauces<br />I do not wish to really compare but for an idea of the flavor I must ,However it is not anywhere near a match. Marie sharps has no rival that I have yet found,<br />and I do try them all . This sauce brings a lively zesty bright flavor to most any food ,Ok I have not tried it on ice cream but have been tempted  .It is not a sweet sauce<br />I urge any who enjoy that special zing a good hot sauce brings to give this a try it is very very good .the pronounced flavor of the scotch bonnet pepper leaves you looking for and wanting more it has an almost fruity flavor which is brought out very well in this sauce. Good luck hope you enjoy

review/summary: Bought some in Belize.
review/text: Bought some Marie Sharp's hot sauce in Belize. Tastes great. Has heat but it is more about the flavors that are blended in with the heat. We spoke with several people that are from Belize before we decided to make a purchase. Everyone loves Marie Sharp's hot sauce. I looked at the ingredients and immediately realized that it wasn't your regular vinegar, salt, and pepper sauce that we have in the US. Tons of fresh ingredients. Prickley pear, spices, garlic, lime and other wonderful things. We fell in love with Belize and Marie Sharp's is a great example of Belize. There is something here for everyone from mild to the hotest of hot but it's all about the flavor.

review/summary: top of my list
review/text: This is by far my favorite hot sauce to date. For some weird reason I still prefer original Tabasco with my eggs but anything else I want to spice up gets this. Other than a few breakfast items I feel those heavy vinegar saturating hot sauces drown out a lot of the flavor where this only enhances without covering up the flavor and actually adding to it. The natural flavor of this sauce is second to nothing I have ever tried (and I've tried LOTS) that's for sure. It does have a little kick to it but I'm immune to that after the endless bottles I have consumed. If you are looking to try a new sauce for its flavor, not just the heat you should definitely give this a try. While this does have a nice "kick" it's more of a connoisseur type of sauce so if you're looking to laugh at your buddies this isn't it. It's more of a pleasant "kick" that is full of amazing flavors. Again, if you're in the market for a new sauce for its flavor you need to give this a shot. It's my favorite by far and I highly doubt you'll regret the purchase, my guess is you'll be back for more.

review/text: This has been my favorite hot sauce for the past 13 years, ever since my parents brought be a bottle from Belize.  It's a nice, spicy, flavorful hot sauce.  This isn't a hot sauce for masochists who just want to sweat, it's a hot sauce full of flavor that's used to add taste to whatever you're eating.  It has a nice slow, permeating burn, which I really like.<br />I cannot eat yellow rice without this.  I also dump it onto my tacos.  Word of warning, however: I tried mixing this with Tostito's queso dip and everything ended up just tasting like vinegar. So...don't do that.

I've tried Louisiana hot sauces and they are to vinegary for most lighter food but this doesn't taste of vinegar it has more of a garlicky taste. so it doesn't overpower anything.<br />I do have other sauces I like for certain foods but this one I love on everything.

review/summary: The most bang for the buck for your daily cuppa
review/text: Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with � tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.

I thought it would be more cost effective to order the larger package, but now I have to figure out a way to get rid of this tea and re-order the smaller boxes.  Maybe I can add it to my compost pile!  I just wish I had known.

review/text: What a wonderful surprise! Salad in a package that tastes "homemade," as another reviewer also observed. The box includes a packet of dry macaroni and dried veggies that you cook like any ordinary pasta and a smaller spices packet. You need to add mayonnaise (I added some creamy Italian Salad Dressing in place of part of the mayo), but you might be able to figure out some imaginative lower-calorie options. It is so true that everything in the kitchen (and in the world) is chemical, but too many packaged foods with ingredients panels on the box truly taste chemical rather than organic, and this was a delightful and surprising exception. I'd definitely advise adding additional diced and chopped veggies: tomato, cucumber, celery, onion, olive and radish would fit well, wouldn't overwhelm the flavors and would enhance the visual presentation. One of the big pluses is that you can buy up in advance and keep a supply of this Pasta Salad on hand for culinary emergencies of many different kinds.

review/text: One of the nicest things about this product is that you control the amount of mayonnaise you desire ... and have the option of low fat, olive oil based, etc. This is not the "seasoned salt" macaroni salad though. It is more along the lines of an herb mix. You can jazz it up with fresh vegetables like tomatoes and green peppers if you wish. It's a meal for me. And because you rinse the pasta with cold water after it cooks, you can dig right in!

The low tannin makes it great for settling an upset stomach and very agreeable to drink.  The more I learn about rooibos tea the more fascinating it becomes. What a great product!

review/summary: High Quality; Great for Pistachio Ice Cream
review/text: For homemade pistachio ice cream, I wanted to oven-toast my own fresh pistachios.  Locally, I couldn't find any raw pistachios, in or out of the shell--only unsalted, already-roasted, in-the-shell pistachios.<br /><br />These raw, unsalted,  Bayside Candy pistachios are perfect for my needs. The quality is excellent--the pistachios are fresh, uniformly plump, good-tasting.  Better yet, I don't have to get out the nutcracker and shell the nuts (some pistachio shells are stubborn to crack).  I freeze the 2-lb. bag of shelled pistachios, then thaw and toast the pistachios in small quantities as they're needed.  For pistachio ice cream, I use the recipe from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060187654">The Best Ice Cream Maker Cookbook Ever</a>.<br /><br />The pistachios are packed in two individually sealed plastic bags.  The price (before shipping) compares quite favorably to the price in my locality for unsalted, roasted-in-the-shell pistachios.  Because I don't need the shells for recycling or composting, I'm really happy to buy the shelled pistachios in bulk, and pay for nothing but the nutmeats.

review/text: This definitely has to be mixed with something to make it tolerable, and I think it may take a few tries to get used to it. I mix it with protein shakes; the flavors of the protein shakes fortunately dominate vs. the taste of the hemp powder. It's a little weird drinking a concoction that looks green but tastes like banana, but the health benefits are worth it to me. It is gritty however. At first I tried it plain and had to basically choke it down, but I guess it's grown on me. Bottom line: if you're dedicated to finding a good vegan source of protein and other nutrition, it's worth a try to experiment with it by adding it to smoothies and other recipes.

I don't recommend that unless you just  need nutrition and don't care how it tastes. If I were going to go non-dairy, I'd probably go with vegetable juices, possibly apple cider. The hemp seed powder has a slightly nutty flavor that goes well with other nutty flavors, or pretty much disappears with a little vanilla.

review/summary: Taste, Mixability Poor, Nutrition Optimum
review/text: This powder tastes very earthy (think vegetable fibers and peat) frankly.  If you're consuming this, you're probably not particularly interested in drinking a milkshake (If you are, go to the Mickey Dees and grab a big ol' glass of milk and assorted toxins).  This is not a product that is meant to "taste like candy", so if you are used to those designer whey powders that are full of sucralose and/or other artificial toxins and ridiculous flavors like  "Super Duper Berry Cookie Crunch", then you will find this product to be very disappointing.<br /><br />This product has very low solubility in water or milk, but mixes better with any freshly squeezed (non-factory-processed juices).  Fresh squeezed juice will generally have pith, fiber, etc. left in it that adds to its viscosity and greatly lowers the rate of dissolution (how long it takes for the hemp to become 'unmixed' and sink to the bottom of the glass).  Essentially, the thicker the solvent, the less that the hemp will settle.  Additionally, having the juice at room temperature will further increase the solubility.<br /><br />I might also suggest a shaker/bottle combination of some type, as opposed to an open glass stirred with a spoon.  I use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018G4ZEW">BlenderBottle 28-Ounce with BlenderBall, Blue</a> myself.<br /><br />If you want a cheaper way to mix up milled hemp, please note that the above rules are applicable to canned tomato juice, since it is viscous, and stores well at room temperature (and is dirt cheap).  Most of the time I take my hemp protein with a can of no-salt-added tomato juice (it is delicious and so easy to make for a low-carbohydrate, high-protein breakfast.<br /><br />This product is pure and truly free of chemicals, there is only one ingredient:  Cold-milled hemp protein, mechanically pressed (no reverse osmosis or other chemical processes are used on the hemp seeds).  The reason that people consume this is for maximum nutrition.  All you get is Protein, antioxidants, heart-healthy fatty-acids, and a little fiber (from the hulls), that is everything nutritionally in this stuff.  It is awesome.

I threw 4 tbsp into a spinach, strawberry, blackberry, apple smoothie and it .. was.. fantastic. I've had worse, more gritter powders (Ulitmate Meal mix). I enjoyed this very much and so did my 3 year niece who is a picky eater. If you add fruit you don't taste the hemp at all. My favorite part .. it's less than $15.00 per bottle & really that is a bargan compared to the other vegan/plant based powders on the market.

review/summary: My morning ritual!
review/text: I had originally stumbled upon Living Harvest Protein Powder while looking for a substitute for an amazing 21 day cleanse/shake a nutritionist in SF had given me. Because the cleanse was so expensive to keep up, I asked for another high protein alternative that was less $$.  She had told me to use Whey Powder so I bought it but was unimpressed.<br /><br />I wanted to have a healthy morning shake so looked a bit further and found the Hemp Protein powder at the Vitamin Shop and thought I'd give it a go. It is WONDERFUL! I drink this every morning with Green Super Food, Hemp Milk, Blueberries & honey. It has really changed my life. I have a ton of energy and don't feel hungry until more than an hour after my usual breakfast.

review/summary: looks gross, tastes good
review/text: Opened the cannister and was put off by the color, but I mixed up a shake anyway. I mix it with original flavor hemp milk and a couple of spoons of vegan sugar, use a stick blender and I love it, the added sweetness makes all the difference! I actually could drink it all the time!

review/summary: Great in smoothies
review/text: I've just started using this in smoothies.  I have been put off by the texture and flavor of many protein powders, but this one is great.  I've been limiting dairy and high-carb juices and fruits, so I make a "coconut" smoothie every morning: light coconut milk (NOT CREAM), this hemp powder, a teaspoon of raw coco powder, chia seeds, and a very small amount of sweetner (I use Stevia).  Blend with ice and enjoy!  I've also put frozen coffee cubes in this smoothie...sort of like an iced frappe in the morning.  Delish!

review/summary: Best protein powder I've tried
review/text: I've never been big on protein powders, mostly because I can't stand the way they taste. I've tried different brands, soy and whey, chocolate and vanilla, etc. etc., and they all just kinda gagged me. Recently I became a vegan, so I've been looking for non-animal (and non-soy) protein sources to supplement my diet. I bought Living Harvest organic hemp protein powder at a local health food store, as well as another brand of vegan (non-hemp and non-soy) protein powder. The other protein powder I bought has been a huge disappointment - it tastes like bitter vegetables and is very thick. No matter what I add it to, it's disgusting and totally ruins the food. I tried it last night in split pea soup, thinking it would go well since it tastes like carrots and peas anyway, and I was wrong. But the hemp powder has been really good. By itself, I wouldn't be able to stomach the taste. But I spoon in 4 tablespoons in a cup and then pour in V8 fusion (the kind with veggie and fruit juice mixed), then mix very thoroughly. The key is mixing thoroughly and drinking it quickly. When I do this, it doesn't taste the least bit bad, doesn't leave an aftertaste, etc. I feel good pretty instantly after taking it, like it gives me a little pick-me-up. I would recommend this even to omnivores, as I think the taste is superior to "regular" protein powders (due to the lack of artificial flavors), and because I feel like it's more easily assimilated by the body.

review/summary: Works well in smoothies.
review/text: I bought my first order of this a few days ago and have experimented with putting it in smoothies. I make a banana, frozen strawberry, yogurt, and almond butter smoothie that I really like, for which I have used soy protein in the past. I'm starting to worry about eating too much soy, however, so tried this option. It works just as well but the green powder does make my smoothie turn light "brown." The nutty taste blends in well with my drink because it already has the almond butter -- so I don't really notice any flavor change from the soy. I also add a splash of vanilla, which helps. My wife thinks the color is gross, but I don't really care what color I am drinking. So I can definitely recommend this product for smoothies. (As an aside, the same folks make Living Harvest Hempmilk, which is nutty in flavor and also good.)

review/summary: It is not bad :)
review/text: I was put off at first by the GREEN powder!  But, it isn't that bad. There is a little of a grainy texture in the smoothie and it is a tad nutty, but not a strong nut flavor.  I use a non-dairy (blue almond) vanilla milk (around 5-6 oz) , 1-2 bananas, 4-5 strawberries, 2-3 crushed icecubes and a couple scoops and blend it in the blender.  It isn't that bad....and if color is an issue and you have to have everything a pretty color, than...natural is not the road to go ;) [...]

review/summary: Absolutely wonderful!
review/text: I am so pleased with the Tempt Hemp Protein Powder.  This is my first experience with hemp powder so I'm really glad I read the reviews before buying.  I've tried countless protein powders over the years and I haven't found anything I'm in love with until now. I wanted to find something to add to my morning fruit shakes that would provide more than just protein. Meanwhile, I was trying to find a way to increase my greens and omegas. I came across hemp powder many years ago and wanted to try it but it was expensive and not something I would have used regularly at the time. I'm glad it has become affordable and more readily available due to online ordering. I think it tastes fantastic in a fruit smoothie (bannana, strawberries, blueberries, coconut milk) and I am very excited to try other things with it as well. It has texture to it. Best way I can describe it is "not quite fine particles but not particularly grainy." It tastes "green" which is a flavor I love. I like that its not overpowering, just polite. It is earthy, yet subtle. Quite pleasant. I will order again and again!

review/summary: hemp protein powder in dessert
review/text: Just bought this Hemp powder for adding some protein to my diet, but was discouraged upon reading reviews regarding what it's good to mix it with.<br />However, with my being an "ice cream-aholic", I decided to try a rounded-teaspoon of this hemp powder stirred into a scoop of Costco's high-fat vanilla ice cream, and it tasted great!<br />So I added another heaping teaspoon to it, and find it easily edible, and am going to have a second serving.<br />Although I was aiming for high protein/low sugar/low salt/low junk additive product.....I was going to eat the ice cream sometime today anyway.  So why not "require" myself to add this protein to it when I have ice cream....at least until I have a chance to purchase some of the other suggested items to mix this hemp powder with.

review/summary: Love it
review/text: It took me a while to get used to the taste. But now that I have, I absolutely love it. Plain organic yogurt with hemp tastes delicious, granted I only use 1-2 teaspoons per cup. It's a great pre-workout supplement as I have noticed more endurance. If you're keen on flavor, this product might not be for you. Try the vanilla flavored one.

review/summary: Pink Method
review/text: I use this as part of the Pink Method plan! I love it--I add 2 tbsp of it with 1 cup coconut milk, 1 cup frozen strawberries, and sometimes a banana. I just started adding a teaspoon of organic raw cacao powder. Blend...and OMG you will love it!
