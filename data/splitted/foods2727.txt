review/text: I have a standing order for Gloria Jeans K Cup Hazelnut. On the last shipment,I noticed the K Cups didn't look like I thought they should have. The lettering was outlined in white, and there was nothing that said "Hazelnut" like there used to be. I did go to Gloria Jeans offical page, and I could not find K Cups that looked like that. Makes me wonder if what I got were counterfit versions. Also makes me think I'll cancel my next order.

review/summary: Great Tasting Hazelnut Coffee
review/text: Gloria Jean's flavored coffee's - especially the Hazelnut - are really good BUT you need to brew on the 7-8oz size. All of the K-Cups vary as to what size brew is best for them. It is not strong coffee, but brewed at the right size, it tastes really good and certainly does not taste weak. Everyone I have served it to has enjoyed it. It is not labeled as bold so I don't think it is reasonable to give this coffee a poor review from people who only like strong coffee. This is a flavored "goodie." Beats most of the flavored coffee's I've tried to date.

After slinging the glorified mud that GM passes off as Hazelnut Coffee (got the xtra bold variety b/c GM generally can't make a 7oz cup w/ a regular K-cup - everything tastes like dishwater).

review/summary: No way to know expiration date
review/text: The reason I decided to buy small cans was for making cocktails, since I was tired of wasting grapefruit juice when I bought cartons and didn't use it all. But when these arrived, the expiration was less than a month away! Even drinking a can a day, they will start to go bad before I finish drinking them. I was hoping for a least a few months. Heck, I can go to the store and get "fresh" grapefruit juice that isn't in cans with a better expiration date.<br /><br />Even if I planned on drinking a lot of grapefruit right away, buying these cans is still a waste since it is cheaper to buy it in bulk in larger containers.

review/summary: The Perfect Bloody Mary
review/text: My husband and I love this seasoning. I first bought it in Warehouse Deals when it was only $25.99 for 50 - 2 ounce packages. It is more than double that price now but still worth it when compared to the taste of similar products and prices. We just add a couple of packages to two quarts of V-8 (we mix it right in the V-8 bottle)and refrigerate. No more measuring, mixing, tasting and mixing some more until you get it right. We add horseradish to the Chili/Peppers flavor when we want to kick it up a bit although the mix already contains some horseradish. Don't avoid this flavor because you think it might be too hot or taste like "chili." It is smooth, tangy and has just the right amount of bite to make the perfect Bloody Mary. Of course, you can always adjust it up or down but we personally like the recommended ratio of 2 ounces per quart of juice. Add a couple of large olives, large shrimp, lemon, lime or a celery stick and you are in Bloody Mary heaven. This is nothing at all like the mixes you buy at the grocery store such as Zing Zang and Mr. and Mrs. T's. It is a concentrate which you mix into fresh juice. It makes the perfect beverage to accompany our favorite Sunday morning brunch of homemade quiche and tossed salad which we enjoy alfresco on our deck.

It used to be that you could only find it a finer foods market or deli, but it is getting easier to find now.  Also the price has come down recently since they found an American bottler to manufacture and sell it in the states under license to the French.

review/summary: My sheltie totally digs these rings
review/text: My sheltie was starting to snub rawhide bones, even the flavored ones, and I was trying to find a chew she'd like as she can always use something to clean her teeth. I'd seen the Dingo bones before, but the bright red chicken jerky turned me off. Well, now I was willing to try anything. I first gave her a Dingo Dyno Stix, and watched her devour it over the course of a half hour. She meticulously pulled it apart and ate it until she'd gotten every last bit of chicken jerky. Only part of the innermost bit of rawhide remained. Success!<br /><br />So, she'd had a couple Dyno Stix, so to mix it up I gave her a Dingo Ringo.  More success!  She loved the ring shape, and it took her about 45 minutes to get all the chicken jerky out, so it was a bit more difficult for her to get the jerky than it was in the Dyno Stix.  However, once she'd gotten all the jerky out of the Ringo, more rawhide remained behind that she didn't eat.  I tossed it in the trash.  Despite more rawhide left behind, my dog still had a great time chewing on the Ringo, and I'll continue to buy them.  Also, they're a good single serving size for my sheltie.  However, if you have an 80 lb lab, these are probably too small, posing a choking hazard for a dog who likes to "gulp".<br /><br />For those wondering how big my dog is, she's a 30 lb sheltie, to give you a better idea of how long it might take your dog to eat a Dingo Ringo.

review/text: I love the Dingo Ringos!  Their round shape works well so that the dogs can hold them with their paws while chewing.  The meaty part is imbedding in the middle of the ring, so my dogs have to work at it to get it!  I don't want them to ingest a lot of rawhide so it's nice that they can work their teeth and gums and get a goodie without eating the whole thing!  The dogs love these and it takes them a while to get to the meat so it keeps them busy for quite a while.  My 10 lb mini dachshund is a very aggressive chewer and these hold up well.  My 13 lb mini dachshund has a very soft mouth, but still enjoys these.  Wonderful for the smaller dog!

review/text: This salt's grain is pretty large for table use, but has a really nice flavor and attractive color.  I have recommended this to my friends who need to watch their salt intake because you can "see" just how much salt you are using.

review/summary: Red sea salt
review/text: Used it in a recipe for pulled-pork.  Had never heard of it before and couldn't find it locally.  Ordered it and Himalayan sea salt from Fairies Finest.  I'd procrastinated and was afraid it wouldn't arrive in time, so I called and they promised to get it in the mail right away.  Showed up in 3 days.<br />The salt has undertones of clay, which gives it a deeper flavor and was used as a rub it the recipe.  The liquid smoke overpowered it, but the flavor was there.  I think it best used as a rub or finishing salt.<br />There is also black Hawaiian salt... somehow mixed in with lava!  Have to try that next...<br />P.S.  The salt was well packaged in a jar.

review/text: This made the best kahlua pork for my son's luau party - tasted great. I will say, this is a lot of salt - be prepared to store it for a while. I have also used it in a salt grinder for smaller grain salt. Tastes different than Kosher or other salts. Nice product.

review/text: This mix is unbelievably easy to use; just add water and stir.  No egg or anything else to add.  As to the finished product, it's not the most 'gingery' product I've ever experienced.  That might just be me.  It is still quite adequate.<br /><br />I have only made the cake and not the thinner more delicate cookie thickness that might well have been better.  One bit of advice is to not make it a smooth, overly beaten slurry.  Get out the lumps of the mix and then leave it in an uneven, wavy surface.  Believe me, that will increase the surface area for carmelizing and improve the result 100%...

review/summary: The best gingerbread
review/text: I have been searching the supermarkets for years for Dromedary brand gingerbread. It was the favorite of my family, but disappeared a number of years back. I decided to do a search on Amazon and, lo and behold, it turned up. I was so excited I ordered a case (6 boxes}. I have since made it twice and loved every mouthful. It is as good as I remembered. Thanks Amazon.

review/summary: A Tasty Reminder of Childhood
review/text: My mother was a good cook, but she hated to actually cook at all. If something was available as "instant" or as a mix, we were unlikely to ever see it again made from scratch. But for one recipe, we didn't mind at all and that was gingerbread. Mother always bought Dromedary Gingerbread Mix and it was delicous back then and it still tastes great today.<br /><br />It had become impossible to find the Dromedary mixes here locally so I was delighted to find that it was still being made and even an Amazon Prime eligible product at a decent price. While six boxes sounds like a lot, I recently ordered another six and sent an order to my virtually noncooking sister. It is really addictive stuff and it is virtually foolproof to make. All you need to add is one cup of water and you can even mix it directly in the baking pan with no need to even dirty a bowl.<br /><br />The recipe is said to be based on our very first First Lady Martha Washington's recipe for gingerbread, but whoever created it, it comes out dark, moist and perfectly spiced. We often took this mix on camping trips and baked it on the coals in a cast iron Dutch oven on top of canned applesauce. At home, I sometimes make lemon curd to serve over the slices while my sister loves to eat it hot with butter.<br /><br />If you like gingerbread, you will love the convenience of this mix. If you are capable of setting an oven temperature, measuring one cup of water and stirring and can tell time, it will come out great, just as it did for my Mother decades ago. Why are you still reading this when you could be clicking on the "Order Now" button?

review/summary: Nice start up for stir fry
review/text: I purchased a bottle of this product a year or so ago. The main reason was to provide me with a tool to start the process of creating a stir fry. Normally, I used olive oil tobegin the process. After heating it, I'd add the components of the stir fry.<br /><br />However, when I saw this on the shelf of a local grocery store, I thought that it might add a nice twist to starting off a stir fry. Now, this small bottle is just about empty (I have used it quite a bit when doing a stir fry). And once it is gone, I'll replace it with another bottle of the same sesame oil.

review/summary: Good and healthy food, but an unwanted side effect
review/text: Dr. Harvey's Canine Health Miracle Dog Food pre-mix is handy if you feed your dog home-cooked meals. It contains a lot of veggies and nutrients, and only takes a few minutes to add to the protein (browned bison, for my dog) and oil (olive is what I use) for a complete meal.<br /><br />My dog likes the food and eats it all with relish. She's healthy eating it, too. I have only one complaint. The pre-mix, when hot water is added, turns a dark pink. I talked to someone at Dr. Harvey's customer service number, and was told it's probably beets that are making it that color since the food contains no dyes. The problem with the food taking on that dark pink color is that a dog with white hair eating the food will get dark pink stains on the hair around her mouth. When she eliminates, it also stains the white hair in that region dark pink! Sometimes she will chew on one of her paws soon after eating and--you guessed it! The white hair on that paw turns dark pink!  I've tried thoroughly washing her whiskers as soon as she's finished eating, but it doesn't remove the pink color. Washing in the other stained areas doesn't help either.<br /><br />If your dog has a dark coat, it probably won't show. Just be aware that a dog with a white coat is going to have some dark pink staining after eating this food.  I suggested to Dr. Harvey's customer service agent that removing the beets and replacing that veg with something else might be a good thing to do, but I don't guess they took me seriously! Maybe no one else complains...or cares about having a two-toned dog with dark pink stains on her coat.

review/summary: Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!
review/text: All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: I bought this for my 8 year old German Shepherd/Aussie mix and she loves it! With all the chemicals in dog foods and recalls I didn't want to worry about what my dog was eating, so I tried this food out and it feels good knowing she's enjoying something good. My dog's health has improved, she has even more energy than before & is showing very little discomfort of a leg injury. What I noticed immediately is that her coat became shinier and softer. Then the energy levels went up even higher & this did not upset her sensitive stomach. The food is easy to make, takes just a few minutes & before you know it your dog will be waiting patiently for dinner every day. Mine tries to push me out of the way so she can eat it all before it's even ready.

review/summary: My dog is too picky
review/text: I'm only giving this two stars due to my dog being extremely finicky. I have a one and a half year old lab and he has been a picky eater since I brought him home at 8 weeks old. I tried this product because he suffers from chronic diarrhea.  Unfortunately I cannot rate this product fairly because my dog stuck his nose up at it and walked away. I was hoping to find a miracle product that he would eat and aid with his bowel issues. This product has many great reviews so I am very disappointed that I won't get a chance to try it out. Please note that my review is not negative against the product, but due to my dog being an extremely picky eater.

review/summary: Great Tea for the Money!
review/text: All I can say about this wonderful tea is that it is an excellent blend of red, white and green and it's organic, too.  There's really no way to describe in words exactly what the tea tastes like, but imagine a light green tea with top notes of peony and a slight hint of minty earthiness and sweetness to the bottom note.  Hot, this tea is calming, yet vibrant in taste.  Cold, the mintier side of the tea comes out and is very refeshing.<br /><br />I am GLAD I got so much of this, because I drink several cups a day.  I reuse each tea bag once or twice.  Note that these tea bags DO NOT have little strings on them.<br /><br />A definite enjoyment for any tea lover and I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something new and exciting in their tea.

An internet order  was lost, even though I received a confirmation via email. I was offered no discount or upgraded shipping, no additional product with my order, no discount on my next order, not even an apology for the 7 day delay. Just an excuse that the email order was lost and that her IT guy would be on the problem tomorrow. This is not the first problem I have had with an order. They do not give a tracking number. When asked for one the odds of getting one are 50-50. I have had so many problems with my orders I will go without my Aunt Lizzies cheese straws. I will miss them greatly however I need the hassle associated with ordering them less than I need the cheese straws. Ann, I wish you the best in the future and suggest you participate in customer service training classes to refrain from losing additional customers in the future.

I've always enjoyed corn flakes growing up but when I came across Whole Foods 'organic' corn flakes, I was shocked. All this time, I've been eating crappy corn flakes. Just compare the first few ingredients of Kellogs versus this. Nature's Path corn flakes has a crunchy, crisp taste. It taste just sooooo good! Also, it takes longer to sog up compared to Kellogs. So if you like corn flakes, you will enjoy this brand! I will definitely buy another batch again! And Amazon has it for a good deal too.

review/summary: Great tasting corn flake cereal
review/text: This is a great tasting gluten-free corn flake cereal. I like the fact that it is also organic and is offered at a lower price than what is available locally. The fruit juice sweetened taste is not too sweet but just right for my taste buds. I enjoy other Nature's Path cereals, too. The company does a good job making delicious cereal products for those sensitive to gluten.

review/summary: CornFlakes- used in meatloaf
review/text: Since my son has wheat and dairy sensitivities, making meatloaf without crackers was quite a chore. I have used gluten free crackers, but was unable to get them so I tried these cornflakes. They really make a great substitution for crackers. And the meatloaf was really great. I crushed the cereal and it works!!!!! I liked it better than regular meatloaf!!!!

review/text: These Betty Crocker Triple Berry Muffin Mix pouches make wonderful tasting and easy to make waffles.  The instructions for the waffles are on the back of every pouch.  Sometimes if I want waffles that are more decadent I add Hersey's Cinnamon chips on top of the batter in the waffle iron just before they cook.  You only need to add butter on top, syrup is not necessary.

review/text: Muffin Betty Crocker Triple Berry / B000EMQF7Q<br /><br />I love buying bulk on Amazon, but I couldn't find my "Martha White Wildberry" muffin mixes. Betty Crocker comes to save the day with these muffin packets that look and taste identical to the Martha White version.<br /><br />I love these muffins. Yes, the berries are imitation berry chips (as stated in the product information), but they taste good. I like to make these muffins on Sunday and take them to work throughout the week as my morning breakfast. They are wonderful and sweet, very tasty plain or with a little butter on them. I've never tried jam with them, but I expect that would taste very nice as well. They store well in the fridge and never taste "old" or soggy.<br /><br />These packets only make 6 regular sized muffins as opposed to the Betty Crocker muffin mix boxes which make 12 regular sized muffins. So if you want 12 muffins, you will have to double up; on the other hand, if you only want 6, there's no waste, which is nice. You will need water to make these - that's the only difference I can see to the Martha White mixes which required milk.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

review/text: This flavor is very hard to find in the stores around here. Either they don't carry it or it is always sold out. The price is less than I can buy it for when I do find it by about 25%. The fresh berry flavor in these has me buying them several times a year. You won't get a single bite from first to last that isn't loaded with berries. Just add water, mix lightly, put into your muffin tins or papers and bake. They even smell like fresh berries when they are baking... I don't buy any other flavor or brand since the first time I tried these.

review/summary: ZERO berries in this "triple berry" mix!!
review/text: If you really want berries in your muffins, go elsewhere! It's hard to see from the small picture on amazon, but this "triple berry" mix has only "imitation berries" -- i.e. collections of chemicals/food coloring to make them look like blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries. Yuck! If you really want "triple berry" muffins, try a plain blueberry muffin mix with REAL blueberries and add your own fresh blackberries and raspberries. Now THAT'S yummy!<br /><br />P.S. Guess I sounded overly snotty as I have only 1 helpful review out of 5!  Can't figure out why the other 4 people didn't find the review useful -- if I were thinking of buying something called a "triple berry muffin mix" I would want to know if it really had any berries in it.  This mix doesn't!  Now come on, isn't that helpful to know?  :-)

review/summary: A VERY FINE GRAPE SEED OIL
review/text: I use this oil for cosmetic purposes, mostly as a catalyst carrier oil for Ormus and essential oils, and it is of very high quality and fineness and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has no off smell or color, is a top shelf oil and no doubt would be a primo cooking oil if any were left over for me to use it. The deal with people having issues with dents in the containers is not an issue for me, there was a small indentation on one of the cans but I could have made it myself prying the cans out of the shrink wrap. As long as the oil is in the cans I am good. Again, these are not decorative items for me, but utilitarian containers. Love the oil. You will, too.

review/summary: Excellent kitchen oil, even better for skin
review/text: I keep one bottle in the kitchen and another in the bathroom.<br />For cooking I almost exclusively use this oil, rarely I use Canola or Olive oil. The reason is this oil is very healthy full of antioxidants and it resists heat better so it makes it especially good for frying without releasing harmful byproducts when heated. Also as a dressing for salads is delicious because it has a tasty flavor.<br />For the body I use this directly on my body and face as moisturizer or mixed with raw shea, mango or other butters or just with body lotion to make a more liquid and more moisturizing lotion. It's really good because it doesn't leave your skin all over oily, it's absorbed fast and the antioxidants help your skin as much as your inside.<br />This particular oil for La Tourangelle is high quality oil at a decent price and the bottles are easy pour.

review/text: Grapeseed is an excellent oil for everything from cooking and salad dressings to hair and body applications.  The taste is mild and nutty, and the texture is smooth and light.  Grapeseed oil is one of my preferred oils for vinaigrette.  I also love grapeseed oil for sauteeing since it is has a nice flavor, but also has a higher smoke point than the more popular olive oil.  This particular brand is by far the best.  It is far better than anything you will get at a health food store.  Grape seed oil should never be deep green, just as a point of comparison for quality.

review/summary: My new favorite grapeseed oil
review/text: I originally purchased this product for the price, as I needed one bottle for my home and one for my RV, and buying a 3 pack on Amazon was cheaper than buying 1 bottle at my local store.  Although 1 can did arrive with the side dented, I just opened that one first to avoid any risk of early spoiling due to the dent.  The containers themselves are beautiful, and come with a nice little pour spout to guide the flow of oil out of the can, although it still drips onto the edge of the can when I pour oil out.  Aside from the aesthetics, the flavor is very mild in comparison to others that I have tried.  I have used it on my lips when I didn't have chapstick available and have had no problems with skin irritation.  I am now using this in place of all oils other than olive oil in my cooking with great success.

review/summary: Very flavorful but also very mushy
review/text: I had seen in a review for a similar product that these don't reconstitute with any of the crispness of fresh peppers, but I found that to be an understatement; these are downright mushy. On the other hand, as long as you only expect to use them for adding color and flavor, these are great. The green bits don't brighten as much as the red. Because of the mushiness, the amount of flavor in a given volume is stronger than with fresh dices, so be careful of using too much.
