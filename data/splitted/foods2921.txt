review/text: Having several cats with REALLY major "cat breath", Greenies were the only things I found that helped, and I couldn't get them anyplace except at my vet's office. This was a MUCH better price, and the amount will keep the guys supplied for months.

review/summary: Feline Greenies Variety Pack
review/text: I have 8 cats, they are between the ages of 3 years and 5 years.  I have bought them different treats from time to time and some will like them and some of my cats won't.  Then I bought "Greenies" and all my cats love them, even Freeway.  He got his name because he was found on the Freeway by Caltrans, he was just a kitten.  Needless to say he is very timid but "Greenies" has brought him out of his shell.  He even takes them from my fingers.  I keep the "Greenies" in a cupboard under the TV and all the cats come running from everywhere if they hear that cupboard door open.  I feel like the Pied Piper with "Greenies".  My best friend loves her cats too so I gave her some "Greenies" for them.  My cats. Toes, Ralf. Chip, Missy, Peanut, Thomas, Freeway and William all recommend "Greenies" for your cats.  Plus they keep your cat's teeth clean too!

review/summary: Some cats love em!
review/text: I have 3 cats and one of them would give Greenies 5+++ stars if he could.  He will come running from anywhere when he hears the bag jiggle and he loves them so much he'll do tricks to get them.  My other two cats don't seem to care for them.  I'd say, buy a bag and see for yourself whether it's love or hate.

review/summary: Cats love these and they provide potassium
review/text: Greenies Cat Treats are the best cat snacks. All my cats think they are cat candy and always eat them up when offered - one even fetches them when tossed (the treat, that is). The package is recloseable and each variety is different and appealing. They are crunchy but not messy. They provide nutrients that cats don't always get enough of, especially for good muscle tone for indoors cats. The package I purchased was a much better value than one at a time purchase at the store - plus, it is often difficult to find them in stores. So I recommend them- and more importantly, my cats think they are divine.

review/summary: Greenies can pose a risk of intestinal blockage and death!!
review/text: PLEASE, please do not feed these treats to your dogs/cats. The company has not publicized the risk of blockage and choking, and 13 dogs have died as a result of ingesting Greenies. Try googling "Greenies" and "blockage" or "death." This product is not safe for dogs.<br /><br />I was sent a free sample of the "reformulated" Greenie in the mail. The package claims the treat is "easier to digest", so I gave the treat to my dog, a 100 pound weimaraner. I watched my dog chew the treat, and he chewed it appropriately, taking his time to chew the pieces into small, digestible chunks.<br /><br />The next day, my dog refused to eat or drink anything and vomited at least three times. He acted listless and lethargic all day, so that evening we called our vet. We told the vet that the last thing our dog ate was a Greenie. The vet informed us that Greenies are known to cause intestinal blockage in some cases. He suggested that we take him to the emergency vet clinic for advanced treatment.<br /><br />We took him to the emergency clinic for x-rays and diagnosis. The vet treated him with an anti-vomiting medication and told us to return if he continued to vomit. The cost of this visit was approximately $400.<br /><br />The next day, we woke up to find our dog covered in bloody soft stool. He has had three bouts of diarreha in two hours, all of it soft and bloody. We called our vet and he told us that the dog was experiencing severe intestinal distress, which was causing the bloody stool. He suggested we give him water and return to the clinic in the early a.m.<br /><br />Thankfully, our dog passed the Greenie through his body. Had he not passed the Greenie, he would have required exploratory surgery, which my vet estimates will cost approximately $3,000, depending on the nature of the blockage.<br /><br />The representation that the new, reformulated Greenie is "easier to digest" is patently false. Our dog properly chewed the Greenie, but yet the treat was still insoluble and indigestible. His ingestion of the Greenie caused serious health issues. These things aren't safe -- please don't support this company or put your dog's health at risk.

review/summary: Beat the Summer Heat with Raspberry Lemonade
review/text: Since the temperature is rising and summer officially seems to have arrived I've been keeping bottles of water in the refrigerator. By mixing in a packet of this delicious drink mix you can make water a little more exciting. I love the tart flavor and don't think it is overly sweet like some of the other mixes I've tried. With other flavors I was using half the packet at a time in a 16.9-ounce bottle of water. With raspberry lemonade I'm using the entire packet. What I really love about this mix is the hint of floral flavors. It is difficult to describe but it makes the drink a little more exotic. To be honest this is one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. I'll be buying more!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

I like it better than Crystal Light's lemonade or pink lemonade.<br /><br />My local store carries this, but at nearly double the cost here on Amazon (although Amazon's prices vary widely from seller to seller). I need to drink more water, and this helps.

review/summary: I really love the lemonade flavors of crystal light...
review/text: What I noticed about lemonade flavors in general is that it is a stronger flavor than other flavors. I actually don't like anything TOO sweet and I try not to consume too much artificial sweeteners, so I only use 1/2 of this for the water suggested... Actually I cut it down to 1/3 and it turned into more like a sweet tea ish flavor. I was hooked on diet sodas and then I started using this as a replacement and now I'm cutting down on this as well! :)<br /><br />Also nice thing to have in your pocket when you wanna mix it with cocktails without adding unnecessary calories.

review/summary: Tart, sweet and absolutely refreshing
review/text: I'm supposed to drink 64 ounces of water daily. I buy Crystal Light because I'd rather drown in plain water than drink a half gallon of it every day.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4IMA">Crystal Light On The Go Raspberry Lemonade</a> is tart, sweet and absolutely refreshing. I use Crystal Light On the Go packets with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NCDE70">Nalgene Tritan OTG BPA-Free Water Bottle</a>. The packets are easy to carry, so I keep a box at my office and several packets in the glove box of my truck.<br /><br />My other favorite flavors are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4DXE">Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4DYI">Crystal Light On The Go Peach Tea</a>. Both are just sweet enough to suppress my appetite, especially in the afternoons.<br /><br />I've found that Crystal Light is best when it is slushy cold. The instructions say to add one packet to 16 ounces of water. What I try to do is add 12 ounces of water, then fill my Nalgene Tritan water bottle with ice cubes or, better yet, crushed ice. After 30 seconds of shaking, I have an inexpensive, low calorie alternative to the office soda machine.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.

review/text: Like some other reviewers, I found this a bit too tart. Then I remembered a co-worker using only part of a packet for her 16 oz. water bottle, so I thought I'd try it.<br />Now it's my favorite flavor. I use half a packet in one 16 oz. bottle, mixing two bottles at the same time so I can guesstimate "half" better. Works for other flavors, too. Cuts back on the cost and the calories.<br />I, too, wish they'd use less red food coloring in all the flavors they use it in. I don't like the "staining" that another reviewer mentioned either. Perhaps they should consider their target audience. And I agree, a variety pack would be nice. There are flavors I'd like to try without committing money to a ten-pack.

review/text: I have probably purchased 5 of these cases over the last few years.  I drink maybe 3-5 packets a week and it lasts me forever.  Before I bought it i tried a smaller box at my local grocery store to make sure I liked the flavor enough to buy a whole case.<br /><br />Reading some of the other reviews I want to clarify: these are NOT calorie free.  There are 10 calories per packet.  So if you are using 6-7 packets per day, that's 60-70 calories. However, I do love this stuff.  Like one of the other reviewers, I also drink a lot of water - usually 70-100 ounces per day.  So, as you can imagine, every once in a while it's nice to flavor it up.  The only down side is the amount of artificial sweetener I am ingesting.<br /><br />However, it tastes great, and the price is a much better deal than if I bought it at my local grocery store.  Everything in moderation.  I do recommend this product.  (Note on flavors: I like this flavor and the lemon iced tea.  The peach iced tea is just okay.  The fruit punch is YUMMY but is REALLY red! Although everyone's taste is different.  Try the smaller boxes at your grocery store before buying here.  Then you won't be disappointed.) =)

review/summary: Weak flavor
review/text: I switched from caffeinated soft drinks to Crystal Light about 2 years ago and always have a bottle at hand, consuming on average 6 - 7 packets per day.<br /><br />The On The Go packets are very convenient and are easily tucked into a pocket or purse. Just tear open the top, pour into a bottle of water (about 16 oz), shake to mix and enjoy something better than plain bottled water, and with much less calories than soda (10 calories per packet, which they consider 2 servings).<br /><br />With Crystal Light On The Go Lemonade (my favorite) being difficult to find I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade as a substitute. I find this flavor very disappointing. It has very little raspberry flavor, no lemonade flavor and generally tastes watered down and washed out.<br /><br />The positive thing about this flavor is that it contains very little of the red color added to other flavors such as the Fruit Punch which tastes very good but will leave red stains on your lips especially if using a wide mouth bottle. The Raspberry Lemonade is more of a pink color and does not leave stains on your mouth.

review/summary: 13 month old Chocolate Lab. (English) thriving on this food!
review/text: I'm writing as the owner of two Chocolate Labrador Retrievers.  My dogs both eat Orijen food, although my 3 year old eats the adult formula (we alternate between 15 lb bags of the regular adult and the fish adult varieties.)  This brand of dog food is worth the high price and difficulty in finding it to buy!<br /><br />My 13 month old lab is a powerhouse of energy!  She looks like a wet otter when dry, her coat is so shiny and sleek!  We went through several varieties of food trying to combat her terrible gas after eating and thankfully found this food, which our puppy loves; so much so that we changed our older lab to the adult version about 3 months ago.  Both dogs are thriving, and LOVE meal time (although to be fair, they are labs and would likely chow down average grocery store dog food, too).  I can use the dry puppy food as treat rewards when working with my younger dog.  She never tires of it!<br /><br />I'm writing my review mainly because I read another reviewer who INCORRECTLY claimed this food is not appropriate for large breed pups.  Although the reviewer seem well-intentioned, they are not fully informed.  Read the summary below from Orijen regarding their large breed puppy food and the hip dysplasia issue the other reviewer is concerned with.  Of more concern is a high ASH CONTENT in puppy food, NOT simply a high protein content, which puppies actually need for optimal growth.<br /><br />"Orijen Puppy Food: Grain Free Large Breed was formulated because in nature, puppies are facultative carnivores - they thrive on a varied diet of meats with smaller amounts of fruits, vegetables and grasses. Puppies are biologically adapted to process proteins as an energy source, and need animal protein for healthy growth and building strong organs, skin and coat.<br />High in protein and low in carbohydrate, ORIJEN PUPPY FOOD is a grain-free formula that replicates the same rich and diverse balance of meats, fruits, vegetables and grasses that puppies and young dogs would encounter in a wilderness setting.<br />By utilizing special low-ash chicken and fish ingredients, ORIJEN PUPPY LARGE avoids the high ash levels--and subsequently elevated calcium and phosphorus--that are a common concern for large breed puppy owners on high-protein diets. Low-ash ORIJEN features perfectly balanced natural-source minerals, fortified with ocean source glucosamine and chondroitin to nutritionally support healthy bones and joints. Orijen Dog Food is our top-of-the-line dry dog food!"

review/summary: Great Taste and BM's
review/text: We have a 5 month German Shepherd female. This has been the third and best dry food for our dog. The first one Nature's Abundance recommended by the breeder. Although a good quality food, the dog would not eat it, hated the taste even if we added fresh chicken or canned food with gravy. I also think the breeder got some kickback from referring this product. We then tried Innova large breed puppy. The taste was better, but my pup had constant very soft non-formed BM's. After reading reviews about Orijen I thought we'd give it a try. From the very first bite my pup loved it. She will eat the dry food plain, a first for almost any dog I've owned. As recommended we gradually increased the portion of Orijen to the old dry food. When we were at about a 50/50 mix, my pup's BM's started to become formed and more normal. We are finally at 100% of Orijen, no problems noticed, feeding is a breeze, no more finicky eater and the BM's easy to pick up! I think this is a winner.

review/summary: Best in Class Dry Dog Food
review/text: Pet food has an immense range of quality that you can very roughly categorize into three levels.  (1) super cheap food that's basically feeding your dog garbage (1-2 stars); (2) food that's a good compromise on price and quality, containing some ingredients that aren't ideal but overall a healthy product (3-4 stars); and (3) "price is no object" foods that make no compromises (5-6 stars).  Orijen doesn't just fall into category 3, it's the best of it.  It's expensive, but you will not find a better dog food anywhere.  Period.<br /><br />Orijen is a Canada-based company that raises its own chickens, employs its own fisherman to catch fish and deliver them fresh, uses whole eggs instead of dried egg products, and loads its products with the highest quality ingredients you'll ever find in dog food.  It's good for your dog's muscles, heart, coat, skin, and is the most biologically appropriate dry dog food there is.  Instead of grains for the carb content that it needs to form the kibble, Orijen uses highly digestible fruits and vegetables with nutritious antioxidants and vitamins.<br /><br />Check out the first 6 ingredients in this product:  Fresh deboned chicken, chicken meal, turkey meal, russet potato, fresh deboned pacific salmon (a natural source of DHA and EPA), herring meal.  Meat, meat, meat, good carbs, meat, meat.<br /><br />Compare that to the first 6 ingredients in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00393E1KK">Hill's Science Diet Adult Small Bites Dry Dog Food</a>, which I just selected by picking the first large size that came up in a search for "hill's science diet dry dog food."  Chicken, ground whole grain corn, ground whole grain sorghum, ground whole grain wheat, chicken by-product meal, soybean meal.  Meat, grain, grain, grain, low-quality animal filler like beaks and feet, and more grain.  It's loaded with grains that are cheap and known to be difficult to digest, often the cause of allergic reactions in dogs, and not nutritious.<br /><br />If you want a good compromise product, go for something like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009X0RA6">Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul Dry Dog Food for Adult Dog, Chicken Flavor, 35 Pound Bag</a>, a very good food that's a bit more affordable than Orijen.  If you want the best of the best for your fuzzy-faced friend(s), get Orijen.<br /><br />Final note:  this is extremely rich food.  Introduce it very slowly, even more slowly than you normally would a new food, and expect some loose stools during the process.  We started with 1/6 new food and upped it by 1/6 every week, so we took a month a half to transition completely to Orijen.  That helped a lot.

review/summary: Best dog food you can buy!
review/text: After much research and feeding this food to my dog's, I would say this is one of the best dog foods you can buy. It dosen't have the corn, grain, fillers and by-products a lot of the cheaper foods have. It is close to the natural evolutionary diet a wolf would eat in the wild. If you really care about your dog's health, feed them Orijen! It is worth it. My dogs are happy, healthy, have shiny coats, and they love the food.

review/text: I visited a gluten free expo locally and they gave samples of this product and I was hooked.  It has great flavor and low in calorie and sodium.

review/summary: Love these and they are gluten free
review/text: These are my very favorite crackers and savory snack at the moment.  They are gluten free, which is important for any Celiacs out there.  They are thin little, bit sized crackers and do not hold a lot of calories so you can munch down and not feel quite so guilty regarding the caloric intake.  Crunchy with a bit of a tang, though not too spicey.<br /><br />I just ordered another case of them a couple of days ago.  I hate to be out of them.  Can't find them just *anywhere* unfortunately and ordering them to Amazon has been great because they are cheaper that way and can be stocked up in my pantry without worrying about them going bad.  Nice to have them on hand.

review/summary: Cats go crazy
review/text: My cats are finicky about canned food.  One cat usually turns her nose at it altogether.  I bought this on a whim.  It was organic and made in my area of the country.  My cats LOVE it!!  The cat who usually turns her nose at canned food practically attacks me when I open the can because she is so excited.  The 3 ounce size is perfect for my two cats-I split it between the two.  I like to give it to them before I go to bed because they are usually satisfied until I'm ready to get up.....instead of at 3am when they want me to feed them.  I would recommend this to anyone who asks.

review/text: This is one of the few canned cat foods that my 18 yr old cat with IBS and food allergies will tolerate. We tried the brand from the Vet in z/d formula but "Peter" didn't like it. My 2 Sr.Cats have kidney disease so it was important for me to find a food with relatively low Phosphorus levels, and Organix is pretty low.<br /><br />I am very happy to be able to order the little cans of Organix which I couldn't find at the local pet stores. My cats seem to eat more when the can is freshly opened, and that what they need.

review/text: My 6.5 pound dog has pancreatitis, and she wouldn't eat the prescription food that the vet recommended. She's already too thin because of her condition, so I tried Natural Balance Limited Ingredient instead.<br /><br />My little dog LOVES it!  She eats half of a large can, twice a day.  And no more digestive issues. I've also been adding it to my other dog's diet, mixing it with her kibble, and she loves it, as well.<br /><br />It would be great if Amazon would make this brand go to subscription ordering, so that I don't have to worry about remembering to buy more!!

review/summary: Helped with allergies, dogs LOVE the taste
review/text: My golden retriever and yorkie poo are avid fans of Natural Balance's duck and potato.  We started it about 3 years ago when we learned our golden had severe allergies and that's what they've been eating (and love) ever since! When we first started to use it, the golden's coat improved - shinier, healthier and he shed a little less than he had before.  The best part (for me) is the variety of products that allow us to keep him irritation-free and healthy.  They love the biscuits for treats - small for the yorkie poo and larger size for the golden.  The rolls can be cut for soft training treats.  I can cut them small for the yorkie poo and larger for the golden. The dry/bagged food comes in small bites and the regular size. Natural Balance has been part of our family for 3 years and will be for many, many more!

review/summary: Shockingly Good
review/text: I recently bought this along with some almond coffee and was shocked by how strangely delicious it is. I very much recommend this to anyone who likes a subtle hint of something else to their coffee.<br /><br />I also tried the creamer beforehand by dipping a finger in it. The almond flavor is very pronounced, but added to coffee, it adds a very lovely hint of almond. And while it doesn't really remind me of an Almond Joy, it is definitely enjoyable.<br /><br />If you can, try and find some almond coffee (I use Dunkin Donuts Toasted Almond coffee) to go with it! This makes the almond in the coffee exceptionally noticeable, but not overpowering.<br /><br />Give this a try! You'll enjoy it!<br /><br />The only reason I gave this a 4/5 is because I would have liked it to have been a little more coconut-y, but alas this still doesn't completely disappoint!

It dissolves quickly and really goes down even quicker!  The only green tea I've had that tasted this good was at coffee shop in London.  I actually remember talking to the properitor at the time asking her if there was any way she could send me some of her tea, she said no : (.  When I tasted this tea for the first time, it took me right back to London, wonderful!  If you enjoy mixing your own tea and adding your sweeteners, this is the tea for you!

review/text: Put a carob dipped hazelnut in your mouth, then a tablespoon of honey, and that approximates the flavor of these. I could not get past more than half a cookie. Just too sweet. There needs to be a balance of flavors in something like a cookie. This is a lopsided treat.<br /><br />If you don't like cloyingly sweet treats, this won't do. You'd better really love a punch of honey.

review/summary: A decent healthy alternative
review/text: A few months ago I was diagnosed with Celiac disease.  This is not simply a gluten intolerance, but a disease which attacks my intestines and inhibits the absorption of nutrients when in the presence of gluten in any form.  I was more devastated by this news than a couple of other serious revelations I had also received.  I love cookies, brownies, cake, pasta, etc. and actually wept at the thought of having to give them up.  AS I'm a rather determined person, I decided that I was going to get healthy and find alternatives to the things I love.<br /><br />I've been enjoying the KIND brand of fruit and nut bars, and have recently found Caveman Cookies.  The packaging is cute, and I loved that a sample of the Original flavor was included.  I also loved the consistency of this cookie, as it was moist and chewy.  Having said that I think perhaps I'm not a big fan of carob.  About the Alpine flavor I would say its decent, but I much preferred the Original flavor included as a sample.  It does take care of the craving for cake and/or cookies though, so that's good :) On a side note, my 2yr old loved them and threw an ever loving fit when they were all gone.  I likely won't buy the Alpine again, but I'm likely to be a devoted fan of the Original in the forseeable future.  Actually I plan on ordering the Tropical and Original here in just a second ;)

review/summary: Great, but expensive.
review/text: These cookies are excellent.  They taste great, are chewy, and are 'paleo'.  They come packaged individually (in plastic) inside the brown bag that's in the item photo.  But, they're REALLY small.  Definitely not the same size as what's portrayed in the photo.  I'd say they're about 2 inches across.<br /><br />According to the nutrition information on the bag, each cookie has: 75 calories, 4.5g fat, 8g carbs (1g fiber, 7g sugar), and 1.5g protein.  So they might have actually designed the size around the level of calories or something, making it a good all-natural snack that's just about the right energy input, even though most of it is sugar..<br /><br />So, they're really tasty, but they're also quite small in size, which will be the bottom line for most people.  They're definitely worth trying at least once, but if the Caveman Bakery wants me to buy them again, they'll need to drop the price quite a bit.<br /><br />Stars:<br />+4 for great taste<br />+1 for all natural ingredients<br />-1 for price

review/summary: Not what the theatres use...
review/text: I've been trying to replicate the movie theater popcorn experience at home for a year now trying different oils, corn, and toppings.  I purchased this recently after I ran out of Paragon Coconut oil to pop with.  At first I thought it tasted pretty good.  After popping with it 5 times I have just recently purchased more Coconut oil to use for popping.  This product is canola oil, coloring, and butter flavor.  It imparts an almost artificial butter flavor to the popcorn versus coconut oil and the more you eat popcorn made with it the more you dislike it.  At least that's what happened to me.  The smell is odd and not very appealing out of the jug and doesn't change for the better when heated. If theaters are using canola oil in place of coconut oil now then this is not what they use.  I'd stick with Coconut oil since that is what makes popcorn the best.

review/summary: Not Impressed or Pleased
review/text: Given that I have received orders from Carter and Holmes in the past, I was surprised and unimpressed with this order. C and H when ordered from directly has extraordinary packaging methods,the items arriving in stellar condition. This little orchid was in terrible shape; had root rot and required immediate help. The packaging appeared to be hastily done with the seedling just rolled up in some newspaper.<br /><br />That said, I am experienced with orchids and have saved this plant and it is doing well. My reason for going through Amazon was to receive the particular Phalaenopsis I wanted that was no longer available on the Carter and Holmes site but was listed as available on Amazon. I shall have to hope it is really what I wanted.<br /><br />Secondly, the shipping fee is less than if you order from Carter and Holmes and I was curious to see the comparison. After this experiment, I would highly recommend one order directly from the vendor and spend the extra money. Sorry to have to give this negative review, but it is the truth.

review/summary: Bliss in a jar
review/text: I admit that I bought this with low expectations, but there are not many raw, vegan chocolate hazelnut spread options.  I am glad I took a chance.  Simply put, Jem chocolate hazelnut spread is divine.  Creamy, chocolaty with gorgeous hazelnut flavor that just melts in your mouth.  There is no oily texture or aftertaste - only the perfect combination of hazelnut and chocolate on a spoon.  While I am sure that this spread would be delicious on crackers, fruit, crepes, or a myriad of other comestible vehicles, I have yet to open a jar that I did not finish with a simple spoon.

review/summary: Surprisingly delicious
review/text: I was slightly suspicious when I purchased this chocolate hazelnut spread. Several factors concerned me:<br />1. "raw" chocolate. I was not familiar with this.<br />2. "sprouted" hazelnuts. Never seen that before<br />3. Coconut sugar aka coconut palm sugar. Does this taste like coconut? (No more like caramel!)<br /><br />Well, the stuff delivers and in spades.  This is NOT Nutella, this is a concentrated powerful decadent punch that just happens to be health food.  I spooned this stuff like mana from heaven. Had to hold back from eating too much, but was helped by the concentrated aspect.<br /><br />Since getting my jar I researched all 3 points above and have been converted.<br /><br />Why not 5 starts?  The shipping costs involved are just too high. I understand that these great products carry a premium product price and I'm OK with that, but I just don't think the premium shipping price is warranted. That alone has kept me from re-ordering.

review/text: This whole wheat bread by Arnold is excellent! It's healthy for you with its whole grain. While the top crust is somewhat firm, the bread itself and the rest of the crust are pretty soft and tasty when you eat this bread before the expiration date.<br /><br />As of this time this whole wheat/whole grain bread is rather expensive on this website; I suppose that's the premium anyone has to pay if they want the convenience of having these loafs of bread shipped directly to their front door. People like me who want a better price should keep looking especially at brick and mortar stores like supermarkets where this bread should be readily available.<br /><br />I highly recommend this whole wheat/whole grain bread by Arnold; it's healthy and one of the best tasting breads out there!

review/summary: WOW! You gotta TRY this at Least Once!
review/text: I was a little skeptical of buying this at first because I have tasted pure caffeine powder before and its unbearably bitter. The blend the Blast Powder has made was untasteable in everything I tried it with except water..it made it a little sweet. All in all I would highly recommend this product because of the result. I love coffee, energy drinks..etc and I have never received the kind of energy high that I did when I have a take a packet of Blast Powder. Best way I can describe it is that it is unlike anything else I have ever tried. I never got shaky or jittery (like I do sometimes from coffee) or heart palpitations like I sometimes get from Monster drinks. It felt like my brain and mind was focused on a level I have never felt before and the best part is it lasted almost 8 hours! Gotta get some if you havent already :}

review/text: More than doubling the retail price is hoggish.  I wish Amazon exercised at least some control over resellers like this who hugely mark up products that can be bought elsewhere on the web, such as from the manufacturer.  I recommend you shop around, both to save more than 50% of the price and in order not to support resellers like this.  By the way, a similar review to this one was just removed from the website.  I guess the reseller doesn't want it to be known how much they mark this product up...

review/summary: Superb tea
review/text: I discovered this tea at a local coffee shop. This is undoubtedly the best tasting mint tea that I can recall drinking. The mint flavor is much stronger than the ordinary peppermint tea that I buy in the supermarket.<br /><br />However this is not peppermint tea, but a combination of mint flavors. The result is amazing.<br /><br />The coffee shop served a huge 16 oz cup of tea. When I finished the first cup, I asked for a refill of hot water, and there still was enough strength left in the tea bag for another great cup of tea.<br /><br />If you like mint tea that is robust, then you will love this tea.<br /><br />Note: The rating on this product has unfairly been lowered by earlier reviews complaining about the price. However, the current price on Amazon of ten dollars plus a dollar for shipping is actually less than the current price with shipping on the Mighty Leaf website.

review/text: HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS HONEY ROASTED CEREAL, (14.5-Ounce Boxes, Pack of 4), is a truely delicous cereal!  Honey Buches of Oats cereal itself was the FIRST "combination" cereal to be invented, (and, on the back of my current box, it tells HOW and by WHOM it was invented.)  Yes, it has some artificial ingredients -- but it also has vitamins and minerals -- and it tastes SO good!  Those little "bunches" add a nice taste, and here, you can get HONEY flavour without stickiness! All around yumminess, which has some nice nutrition in it, too!  The combination of flakes and sweetened "bunches" makes it a hit with me!  I've even begun to use it as a snack food, in place of potato chips!<br /><br />It's hard, sometimes, to believe advertisements on TV.  But believe me, this IS a great-tasting cereal!  If you like honey and/or sweetness, (but not the "cloying" kind), you will definitely love this cereal.  It's not just "Honey Bunches of Oats"...but the Honey-Roasted Flavour of Honey Bunches of Oats."<br />A total delight to eat!

review/text: Ok.  So why the one star.  Well Amazon ca canceled my subscription order when I got a good deal on it after I canceled it right after that is.<br /><br />Seems they don't wanna honor it also they deleted the order from my history without notice so I wont have records to back it up.<br /><br />It was for 5.50 or so during the sale after sub and save.  I first bought them for 6.50 or so after s. s.,<br /><br />They deleted it right before the 2nd delivery and me canceling on them for charging me the 8 dollar deal. Why do I want that.  Yep always cancel order on them after getting the first shipment. They wont honor the lower price deals anymore if you get them. Well I did change my cc number so maybe they had a error and just wants an excuse to not honor their contract, who knows.  But dont I would not trust s. s.  There is always a catch in good deals.<br /><br />It's a bait and switch. Obviously like all the retailers. They hate careful consumers.  A knowledgeable consumer is retailers worse nightmare.:P<br /><br />Well same old corporation ways.<br /><br />Anyway Now for the cereal review. Pretty decently healthy and tasty for regular cereals . But like all processed foods the stuff they use is processed so the canola oil/veg oil they use is crap and then extra sugar etc.<br /><br />If you do care then try to buy the natural organic cereals, of course even though they take less work they charge more. lame yes less work more pay because there is less supply.  Well this is great and cheap as long as you just want processed food and is less than 11 cent per oz.<br /><br />Otherwise I'll just get it from my local supermarket since its about the same price when on sale.

review/summary: False Advertising!
review/text: I was born and grew up in Indianolia, Iowa, which during my youth was a small town just south of Des Moines (its a lot bigger now!).  I have always been a hometown boy!  I love my hometown.  I have VERY fond memories of my hometown.  I would do anything for my hometown.  Imagine my joy when I came across the listing for "Hometown Favorites" candy!  How fantastic, an entire box of candy made in my hometown of Indianolia, Iowa!  I figured this would be the greatest box of candy I ever bought, one that would combine my moderate love of sweets and my gigantic love of my hometown.<br /><br />I anticipated the arrival of my candy for several days; each day bring me closer and closer to the edge of expectation overload.  Finally, the candy arrived and I busted open the box furiously pouring over the wide selection of candies and scanning the wrappers for any hint of Indianolia, Iowa.  Imagine my incredible disappointment when my hometown was not mentioned on one single piece of candy or even the box for that matter.  Heatedly, I ran to my computer with my new box of candy.  I typed and typed, my original joy dissipating with each keystroke as i learned one piece of candy after another was manufactured somewhere other than Indianolia!<br /><br />This product description is false advertising!  This candy had NO connection to my hometown of Indianolia.  This product gets one star for suckering me into buying it by capitalizing on my hometown pride.<br /><br />The candy was delicious though.

review/summary: WOW - GREAT NUTS BUT THESE MUST BE GOLD PLATED.
review/text: I like nuts in general and actually eat a lot of them; various kinds in various ways.  We use a lot of these pecan halves in cooking especially in deserts and salads.  I am the largest (in more ways than one) user of these Fisher brand pecan halves in our household because they are one of my in between meals snack foods.  I love eating a handful of these nuts with a chunk of mild Cheddar or a nice Colby cheese.  For me, these are a part of a relatively healthy snack food...much better than Ding-Dongs or stuff like that.<br /><br />Anyway, these nuts are great.  They are always fresh when we buy them and they store well in the refrigerator.  They taste good and they are truly "halves" and not semi-crushed pecans that you so often get with other brands.<br /><br />But alas, even though these nuts get a five star rating from me - hey, I am reviewing the nuts and not the seller here, I must take away at least one star.  I do this for two reasons.<br /><br />First, Please note that the price listed here upon this writing is 25.00.  Oh my!  I just bought a bag of these same nuts...same weight, etc. at the local store for a total of 8.98.  Now if you are not a Prime member, you must pay shipping in addition to the 25.00.  Folks, these are expensive nuts! It should be noted that you can purchase a bag od Diamond Brand nuts...same thing really, for about 10.22 on this same site, i.e. Amazon.<br /><br />Second, I am not overly happy with the "zip-lock" bag these come in.  It is difficult to get zipped and sometimes it works and other times it does not.<br /><br />Anyway, take note of this price before you hit the buy button.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

review/text: I consider myself a fan of wasabi peas, having tried several brands.  These peas were shipped with five bags broken in the box, with peas leaking from the box.  The remaining bags were sealed OK, but this was disappointing.  The appearance is green to brown, as others have noted.  They were plenty crunchy, although some were hard.  The wasabi is light, with barely any heat. There was a definite strong flour taste to them, too.  If you are a fan of wasabi, I suggest looking elsewhere.  I know I will not be ordering them again.

review/text: I'm a Wasabi Peas lover and usually buy them at Target or Whole Foods. I love Wasabi and GREEN peas.<br /><br />However, THESE are NOT green (despite the photo on the bag). Subscribed to this product and the first box arrived (12 bags) with 6 of the bags open on the bottom (seems like pressure popped). In all of the bags the peas were almost brown colored and the wasabi taste was so mild I could have eaten a handful without even blinking. Some of the peas even tasted a bit stale.<br /><br />I called Amazon and had the order refunded, canceled my subscription.<br /><br />Going back to WholeFoods for the time being.

review/summary: Good Wasabi Peas!
review/text: Roland Feng Shui Wasabi peas are good tasting, crunchy and fresh.  I only gave them 4 stars because they aren't the largest wasabi peas I've had, but the deal is pretty good when you consider the cost per bag, especially with prime shipping.  I'll buy again!

review/text: Amazon delivers what I NEED, when I need it. All local stores sold out of this item mos ago. Panic-strikened, I found them in Amazon, of course. You want kick, flavor AND don't get your daily dose of veggies - well, here ya go. Don't go V8 route, boys...the flavor is right here!

review/summary: Don't get them!
review/text: These wasabi peas are bad. I should have read the reviews before getting them. The peas are not fresh and they taste strange. I bought other ones from nuts bulk.

review/summary: DON'T BUY!!!
review/text: I purchased these on Auto-Ship. Unfortunately I didn't think the order went thru & pushed it again. I wound up receiving two boxes of what I'd like to call "Rocks". Actually, more like 24 bags of pebbles. I thought I was going to break my teeth! And the Wasabi coating immediately comes right off as soon as you put it in your mouth. Not very hot either!<br /> I had never purchased them on my own before, so I had some "seasoned eaters" try them. They all told me that the problem was that they were stale. I opened the 2nd box just to see if it was a batch issue & that box was just as bad, stale and, rock hard. I cancelled both subscriptions. I will never buy from this company again... Don't you!!!<br /> Now I am about to try another vendor. I am definitely reading ALL the reviews & comments first!!!

review/summary: DON'T BUY THESE TEETH CRACKERS
review/text: I recently purchased this product from a local Hyvee.  They are the absolute WORST wasabi peas I have ever had!.  Not only do they lack the nice green color of others I have had (they are a dull brownish color) they are so hard.  The majority of them were like chewing on rocks.  I had to throw over half the bag away.  I tried them twice thinking I just had a bad scoop.  I'm pretty sure I just cracked a tooth.  I am going to write this company about this horrible horrible product that will now cost me $$$$ in dental repairs.

review/summary: my daughter loves these
review/text: My daughter has a strong preference for spicy, hot foods. She loves thse peas, and the portion control size is helpful while she is watching her calories. These peas pack a punch and are not suitable for people who don't tolerate hot spices well.

Available in 4.4 oz bag or 5lb bag. Go with subscribe and save and save money!!! You will not find them cheaper any where other than Amazon.

review/summary: Salty Nuts
review/text: I've purchased Royal Oak Redskins in the past and loved them,  But, this order (2x40 oz. cans) is too salty to eat.  Efforts to reduce the saltiness ruins the taste that makes redskins our favorite.  And, e-mails to Royal Oak asking for advice/help have been ignored.  So, I'm stuck with five pounds of redskins that I'll eventually throw out.  I'll never by anything from Royal Oak again!

review/summary: Great Value
review/text: Large, flavorful peanuts. They enhanced the taste by adding artificial butter flavor, which I could do without, but they are a great bargain if you purchase them at a discount. I would buy them again. I don't know why Redskin peanuts (not the little Spanish Peanuts) are so hard to find in my area.
