review/summary: Worth the extra $$$
review/text: I've switched from Quaker to this brand because it tastes better.  It has less goo and makes me think "this must be how oatmeal tasted a long time ago," which whether true or not, this oatmeal is easy to make and delicious.  I look forward to the breakfast that features McCann's Irish Oatmeal.  I recommend this to anyone trying to eat oatmeal for its benefits, but who's also anti-goo on this food.

review/summary: McCann's is Simply the Best Oatmeal in the World
review/text: I tried McCann's for the first time 5 years ago. On a whim while shopping at Target, I grabbed a box and the rest is history. These are the finest oats anywhere. Quaker tastes like sawdust in comparison. Well, as fate would have it, Target stopped carrying McCann's. Amazon to the rescue. These oats are nutty, hearty and tasty. The bad reviews seem to have a common thread: the microwave. When you nuke a natural product with no additional ingredients or preservatives, that tends to happen. The steel cut rolled oats stand up better to the treatment. Try those. I never cook these in the microwave. Soak them in milk for a minute or two in a saucepan and they cook in about 3 or 4 minutes on your stovetop. No microwave necessary. Be warned though, once you start eating these, you'll likely not be able to tolerate any other kind.

review/summary: Children Love Them
review/text: My son and daughter both love this oatmeal.  I suggest that you make it with Milk (not water) and add brown sugar after cooking.  I bring it to a boil on the stove and then bring to simmer for 3 minutes. Then remove and let the rest of the milk soak in.  This is not a "rough" "chewy" textured oatmeal.  It is soft and creamy and if you have children who have texture issus, then this oatmeal is for them.  I love it too and will add bananas, raisins or dried cherries when the mood hits.

review/summary: Best Oatmeal in Existence
review/text: Its a shame this is not more widely available in Grocery stores.  Nothing matches its consistency.  So I've resorted to getting my consistent supply online. I cook it on the stove with milk and frozen blueberries.  In a few minutes I have a perfect start to the morning.  No need for sugar - it doesn't get any healthier than this.  Sometimes I microwave it in milk.<br /><br />Now, if you are starting to eat oatmeal (good for you) without that sugar, it may taste like paste at first.  It did to me.  So I used less sugar everyday and eventually weaned myself off of it.  Eventually everything tastes sweeter.  This McCanns oatmeal tastes sweet to me now.<br /><br />SO this is one of those staple foods I cant live without.  My only complaint is the packaging sucks -  the inner bag must be cut with a scissors to open it.  Trying to open it by hand is next to impossible.  It still gets a 5 star because that is a small inconvenience for the taste as a whole, and thats really what we are reviewing.<br /><br />Now if they would just carry it regular grocery stores!

review/summary: I bought the quick cooking
review/text: for my mother. I use the regular steel cut oats, but mom just didn't like the idea of a cereal that would take about 30 minutes to cook. In my opinion the quick cooking is not as good as the regular oats. Not quite as nutty, a little blander. But the difference was not really as marked as say, the difference between good old 3 minute oats and instant (ickey)oatmeal. Mom loved it, the flavour and the convenience.<br /><br />The price is really good. While we have been unable to find the regular steel cut oats locally we did find McCanns quick cooking at a local market, for double Amazon's price. And as always shipping was fast.<br /><br />I made a mistake on this review, I thought I was reviewing the other quick cooking variety of McCann's, the variety that looks like the long cooking kind and tastes like it. This variety is just as awful as american instant oatmeal, mushy texture and taste, the kids and I hated it. I wish I could change the rating of my review to a 1, but I cannot.

review/text: The reason I searched for McCann's Oatmeal was due to the poor quality of all local brands, such as; Quaker Oats, Topps brand oats, and others. They have become tough even after cooking for longer periods than suggested by the manufacturer. McCann's Irish Oatmeal was suggested to me by a neighbor.It is extremely hard to find locally. After finding it at Amazon, others and I tried it and found it to be soft in texture and creamy. It is it he best oatmeal I have ever had and I will continue to buy it from Amazon in the future.

Some called me from McCanns, apologized and sent an empty pre-paid carton to ship the item back to them for further analysis. She said that they would replace the item but never did. However, Amazon refunded my purchase amount. I threw away the packs that had live black insects in them. A total of four boxes. So, beware of live insects and look carefully before opening the packets if you buy these.

review/summary: I too am amazed at all the 5 star reviews!
review/text: I went into the grocery store (Sobeys - in Canada) looking for McCann's 5 minute Steel Cut Oats (which I absolutely LOVE). Unfortunately the store didn't carry this variety, so I opted for this type. I was SO disappointed. I put it in the microwave covered in cold skim milk for about a minute, and when I took it out, it was MUSH! I can still eat Quaker Oats when they're mushy, but this just had an awful taste. Even though the cooking instructions said to cook them longer, even the 1 minute made them sooo mushy! I for one love the chewy bite of steel cut oats, and am able to achieve a close enough mouth-feel with Quaker 5 minute oats (I microwave the oats with half water/half skim milk for about 2 minutes). I advise fellow steel-cut oat lovers to stay away from this one! Trust me! I eat oatmeal everyday for breakfast, and sometimes before my workout in the evening, and as a bedtime snack at night.... so needless to say, I know my oats! Lol<br /><br />Verdict: Go for the 5 minute Steel Cut oats by McCanns - its AMAZING... Steer cleer of this quick cooking variety, and opt for Quaker 5 minute Oats instead!

review/text: The McCann Irish quick-cooking oatmeal itself is a good product, which I can highly recommend. The shipment, however, arrived in a large box with no packing material, nothing to prevent the boxes from being crushed in transit, inner packages of oatmeal floating around outside their protective boxes. Whoever packed this did so with no concern as to how the customer would store the product in pantry - in fact, it appeared they had no concern for their company's reputation. McCann's would be horrified! I'm disappointed and disgruntled. Suppose I had wanted to put one of these in a gift basket?

review/text: I bought the hype about there being little difference between this and McCanns steel-cut.  Wrong!  If you have had the steel-cut, this stuff is just soupy and bland. And the fiber difference?  These oats are processed (cooked, rolled out, and cut into shapes), so in essence the fiber is gone  Convenience?  Big deal.  Make up a big batch of steel-cut, refrigerate and nuke as you wish.

review/text: The "add water" packeted hot cereals are unfit for use as glue. Steel cut oats, a great thing, require cooking worthy of a breakfast turducken. Between are the varied offerings of pastries and cold cereal with characters (I like Cap'n Crunch, the Cap'n, not so much the cereal) or the healthy items if unexciting to the eye from Trader Joe's.<br /><br />And this, a fine morning repast easily prepared, but not such that it can be done without attention and craft. It allows for variation: Vanilla, salt, brown sugar, dried bananas, mangosteen. It allows the eater to feel both a primitive in touch with earth's grains and an urbane sophisticate preparing a meal of yuppie-store grains in a microwave.<br /><br />The ne plus ultra of breakfast!

We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.

review/text: When Princess came to me, she was on mostly dry food. She didn't seem to interested in her food, and used to dump it into her water before eating it. Her previous foster mum suggested I get her moist food. Then started the search. I purchased cans and pouches. And she didn't seem to interested in most of them. I did find pouches she liked, but they were discontinued. So I found these, and Princess just love them!<br /><br />The thing that Princess likes is the texture. The pouch consists of a square of grain-free food and sauce. The square is about 1cm by 1 cm. The recommendation is to give one pouch per 4 pounds per day, which should be 2 pouches for my 9 pound cat. Well, I tried that, but she put on weight. So I give her 1 pouch per day, plus as much grain free dry food as she likes. She's lean and active, and loves her pouches. I pay an arm and a leg for it, but as long as my Princess is happy, I cannot complain. I've tried cans in the same brand, and she just looks at me like I am crazy. She definitely love this brand, and get different taste every day. And a happy cat makes a happy mum :)

review/text: All three of my cats love this food, this is the only food that they'll finish off in one sitting!<br /><br />My cats were mostly on Pate Style but I was frustrated because I was throwing a lot of it away because they wouldn't finish it all, so I decided to try this out. I purchased a few different flavors but they prefer Tuna the best. They'll eat the Salmon & Tuna but not with as much gusto as the regular Tuna flavor.<br /><br />My female cat who has strange ways of eating her food did not appreciate the size of the chunks so before I opened up the pouch, I squished the food so it was not in large pieces. This also helps the the gravy absorb in the food so it's not a soup. I now squeeze the pouches for all my cats, they like it better this way.<br /><br />Also, if it stays at the $28.56 price on Amazon, it's the exact same price in the stores.

review/summary: Even my VERY Fussy Eater likes this!
review/text: I have a VEEEEERRY fussy 2 year old Ragdoll cat who cannot eat dry food (it makes him throw up) and he hates most all canned foods.  (And I know, because I have tried them all!)  Thankfully, I found this food before he starved to death!!!  He really likes it -- he will even lick the bottom of his bowl clean (and he NEVER did that before!)  The food is not pate' style -- it is actually soft, moist little "rectangle" shapes of food in a light sauce/gravy.  I am very happy with the ingredient list, and the fact that it is a high-quality, nutritious, premium food for my fussy boy!

review/summary: Worth It
review/text: Even with shipping charges this is still cheaper than purchasing from a pet store, plus it arrived quickly. My cat is 15 and was developing health issues, the vet said he needed more water content and this brand has the best gravy ever. I switched him from an all dry diet to two pouches a day of Wellness, with a bit of dry sprinkled on top and he loves it. Cleans the bowl!

review/text: My cats love this food and one of them doesn't usually touch canned food.

review/summary: Surprising Results
review/text: I was looking for a new cat food for my cat who is almost 2 years old - he enjoyed his old food, but after reading some articles on the differences in some popular brands I felt compelled to give him a more nutritious product that contained less fillers. I searched online to learn about a variety of product and decided that Wellness was the way to go.<br /><br />My cat isn't picky about his food per se, but he does have distinct likes and dislikes, he loves this stuff! I switched him to 1/2 cup Wellness Dry food and 1/2 pouch of Wellness Healthy Indulgence.  He always eats the gravy first and then will come back for the meat chunks but he eats everything without fail.<br /><br />The results are what have made me a convert and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. My cat's coat is incredibly soft now and he remains active, alert, and very energetic (not overly!).  The coat is really the one place I see a significant change - he had a great coat before, but after a few weeks on this Wellness combo his coat is even softer and vibrant.

review/summary: If the Princess likes it, so do I.
review/text: Princess gets a pouch of food every morning. I rotate so she doesn't have to get the same every day. She usually have three different at any given time. This was the first time I purchased Turkey and Duck. These seem to be harder to get out of the pouch than the others I've tried.<br /><br />I first shake the pouch to get everything to settle in the bottom, then I pull it open. So far, so good. But when I then turn it over, the food gets "stuck" in the pouch a bit. So I usually make sure I open the opening first and shake it a little bit around, turn it on its head, and start milking it out. That seems to work.<br /><br />The Princess seems to like it, so I will continue buying.

review/summary: The BEST food for your cats
review/text: When we adopted our cats several years ago, our vet told us it was really important to feed them wholesome food from the beginning (they were kittens at the time).  She recommended Wellness brand, so we picked up several of the flavors of both wet and dry food for the cats to try.<br /><br />Both of our cats immediately loved the "nuggets in gravy" style wet food over the more common pate style and we haven't tried a flavor that they won't eat (although they do strongly prefer the seafood flavors over chicken or turkey).  I like the fact that the ingredients are whole foods - no fillers or cheap grains.  Although not in this combination, they're foods I eat myself - salmon, cranberries, flaxseed, zucchini, etc.<br /><br />I consider this food a win-win because the cats love the taste and texture and I love that they are eating whole foods that contribute to their silky, shiny coats and general well-being.

review/summary: Best cat food ever!
review/text: My two cats love this food! In combination with the Wellness Indoor Cat dry food, I think it's the best diet you can feed an indoor cat. My brother, an animal breeder, recently told me that every pet food on the market is full of fillers, preservatives, and substandard ingredients. He changed his tune when he read the ingredients on a package of Wellness.

review/summary: Excellent choice - even for the finicky!
review/text: I decided it was time to start feeding my senior cat a wet food diet. She has a tendency to turn her nose up at most of the "healthy" choices, but she absolutely devoured this one. Several months later, she is still loving it and practically licks the bowl clean!  It has made a world of difference in her energy level, her coat is shiny and it has cut down on the amount of waste in the litter box.  The ingredients are all natural and my vet recommended this as one of the top choices of wet food for my cat.<br /><br />The food is in smaller size chunks with a LOT of gravy.  The pouch is easy to rip open, or can be cut. I highly recommend it as a healthy choice and for your finicky feline :)

review/summary: My cat's addicted!
review/text: My cat loves the tuna recipe so much, it is the only food she'll gobble down in a single sitting.  Interestingly, she doesn't to be as keen on the other flavors.<br />She seems to especially enjoy the gravy, almost slurping it down!<br />I give her one pouch a day and free-feed her dry, grain-free kibble.  She's healthy and lean, and her coat is silky and luxurious.<br />Maybe it's because I once owned a 96-pound Labrador that ate me out of house and home, but I cannot understand why people would think spending $1 and change per day to feed a pet is expensive...<br />For the price of a soda, you can feed your beloved pet a grain-free, quality cat food.  In reality, the junky, mass-marketed supermarket brands are a real waste of money, because you are paying for filler ingredients and added junk.<br />$1.20 a day is a bargain for the convenience, the quality, what it does for my cat, and how much she enjoys it. I certainly fitter away more than that each day on myself, in the way of "indulgences"!<br />I know that the economy is bad and there are certainly a lot of people who have fallen on hard times, but for those who can afford to keep a pet in the first place, the cost of higher quality food shouldn't be a deterrent.

Dry food is full of carbs, and he suggested wet food since it's mostly protein and fat - what they would be eating in the wild.  Needless to say our picky felines love the food, their coats are shiny....and we'll see if they loose the extra lbs!  We've also tried other flavors of this food, but this is their fave!

review/summary: Love this stuff
review/text: I originally became a fan of pouch-based cat food with the Nutro line of pouches. However, Nutro was especially hit by the nasty recall episode from a few years back where a number of pet food manufacturers had contamination issues, and they eventually pulled their pouches. I tried a bunch of canned foods afterwards, but my cats never warmed to any of them like they did the pouches.<br /><br />Wellness came out with their "healthy indulgence" line of pouch foods not too long ago, and interestingly the packaging is pretty much identical to the Nutro products, down to the notches to facilitate tearing. I can only imagine that they are using the same manufacturing facilities as Nutro did, but hopefully with a superior product. Everything I've read about Wellness suggests that they make high-quality pet foods. My cats seem to love these as much as they did their old pouch foods. They have now been eating pouch foods almost daily for at least 6-7 years, so I don't have any major concerns about long-term health issues.<br /><br />Overall, these pouches are great. Each single pouch is one serving for one cat, so the costs do add up fast if you have multiple cats and serve this twice a day. I give dry food in the morning and the pouches at night to help conserve costs, but they always finish the Wellness pouches within a half hour, whereas the dry food often sits around unfinished all day. Another plus is that no spoons or forks need to be involved, since you just tear each pouch and shake the contents into the bowl. No mess or debates with spouses about putting cat food forks into the dishwasher with the rest of the dishes!

review/summary: Tasty, Grain-Free, and a hit with my cats
review/text: My boyfriend bought a pack as a one-off to tempt his aged kitty- who can be finicky- into eating. His Kitty was uninterested at the time, so I took it home to my little eating machine, who wolfed it down. She's been eating Wellness products almost exclusively for the past two years, and I was interested in finding a gravy-rich wet food in this line. The tuna chunks are substantial - but not too big - and are in a thick, rich gravy. I feed her a mix of 1 pouch of wet food and 1/2 cup of dry daily, and she is both happy and of normal weight. I highly recommend this food for being grain-free, as my cat has had issues with extra fiber clogging her digestive tract in the past, and free of odd, unrecognizable (and unpronounceable) ingredients.

review/summary: Spicy Goodness
review/text: Mmm..  This type of noodle and flavor reminds me of the Picante flavored Nong Shim instant noodle bowls.  The noodles are clear, and I presume it's not deep fried.  You can see the nutritional information by clicking "Nutrition Facts" near the top.  I want to say that most of the fat actually comes from the sesame paste..  I call that the "oil packet."  You don't have to put that in if you want to lessen the amount of fat you're eating.  It's about medium spicy, and really good.  It comes with two pieces of dehydrated bok choy, which adds some fiber to the meal/snack.  It's not for people who are afraid of sodium or MSG though...  It's got plenty of sodium (1,610mg aka 67% DV).  If you eat it, try to not drink all of the broth, it'll help.  This bowl is more meant for someone with hot water on hand (you could always microwave some water in a bowl and pour it in).  It says it's not microwaveable, presumably because the plastic labeling around the bowl stays on.  I have a hot water dispenser, so this isn't a problem.  I just open the flavor packet, put it over the noodles, add hot water, wait a few minutes, and stir.  Then it's ready to eat and real yummy!

review/summary: terrific spicy noodle soup
review/text: I got hooked on the spicy sesame Crystal Noodle soups when my grocery used to carry them, but now the soup can't be found anywhere in town so I have to order online.  And boy, is it worth it.  This soup is made up of thin, almost clear crystal noodles that comes with a block of dehydrated bok choy and paste, plus a little envelope of sesame paste. You put the block of bok choy and paste on top of the noodles, pour boiling water until it reaches the fill line, then put the lid on and let it sit just a couple of minutes.  Then you add the sesame paste, which tastes a little like peanut butter and pairs with the spiciness of the broth wonderfully.  The paste is a little difficult to get out sometimes, requiring some finesse with a butter knife, but it's worth it.<br /><br />The noodles are filling and taste better than the kind you get in the usual ramen soups.  The broth is a medium spice that builds, and the bok choy rehydrates well with good flavor.  The calories are quite good, only 280, but the sodium is high as you would expect.  I pair a bowl of this with an egg roll or two and am full for hours.

review/summary: Very good instant Tofu Miso Soup...
review/text: Very good, I just tried it tonight...you have to mix it well...but it is very good, it tastes like the miso soup that I had in a Sushi Restaurant a few days ago... Though the tofu pieces are small, the rich taste makes up for it...and if you want more tofu...I suggest buying firm tofu separately, then adding it when you make the soup...that's what I'm going to do... I hope this helped you... :)

review/summary: Once acquired...This (satisfying!) miso soup might be your new addiction.
review/text: I first picked this off the shelf at a military commissary in Kansas one summer... and I never stopped. The first time you try this stuff, it's like wine or avocados; it's a taste that is certainly acquired, and like nothing else. I have fed it to a friend and to my significant other; few like it the first time, but you find yourself strangely coming back for more until it's a staple in your house, like it is in mine. Kind of reminds me of sushi; first time I tried it, I was like, "this is odd, why do people eat this?", then, I found myself craving it a week later. Haha. Now I love sushi and miso! (By the way, it comes in an envelope with 3 individual packets). Mix it in hot water, to taste. You might like it with more or less water, depending on how salty you like your food. -Experiment with it to your satisfaction, and I guarantee, there is much of that to be had.<br /><br />I usually add all 3 little individual packets (it's low-fat) to a decent-sized cup of hot water, add my favorite vinegar, and let it sit and "cure" for a minute or so, since the little green sea-vegetable flakes (and green onions + tofu squares) need time to rehydrate and turn a little chewy and palatable. I then sip it and fish the sea vegetables out to my heart's content.<br /><br />(I also hear that miso can be generally healthy for you!)<br /><br />If you let it sit, the miso will start to separate from the rest of the soup and you have delightful little clouds of miso particles floating in your bowl, which is sort of entertaining and visually delightful, too. I think of it as cheap, delicious entertainment. But then again, I am easily amused. ;)

review/summary: Almost Like the Real Thing
review/text: My love affair with miso, the flavorful paste made from fermented soybeans, started when I lived in Tokyo several years ago.  So, since then, being the miso snob that I am, it has been unimaginable to me to try any instant variety.  But I have to say that when I finally did break down and try Kikkoman Instant Tofu Miso Soup, I was amazed to find that it was practically indistinguishable in flavor and consistency from miso soup made from the actual paste.  While I would still choose the actual product whenever time permits, I would now not hesitate to substitute this great product when I am on the run.

review/summary: A good soup with a unique taste
review/text: Personally, I'd love a bowl of miso soup any day. I first tried it in a very nice sushi restaurant, and then again in a less-fancy one. A few months later, I discovered that Price Chopper sells these exact packets (they're a bit more expensive there than here on Amazon).<br /><br />Miso soup is hard to describe. I think of it as having a taste that you kind of have to acquire...It took me a few bowls to really get used to it. But once you do, it's great! I suggest this for anyone who's interested in Japanese culture and food.

review/summary: Holds its own against any restaurant miso soup
review/text: This is the best miso soup to be found anywhere; it is fabulous and the flavor is just amazing considering it's an instant soup. You can add a variety of vegetables, chicken pieces, pork, beef or shrimp if you like, and chopped spinach and if you love tofu you can add either the firm or soft variety, I prefer the soft.<br />The soup is comprised of fermented soy beans and comes in red (sweeter) or white (saltier) miso paste and fish stock made from bonito flakes and contains kelp as well. I am going to a local Asian market where I live and make my own miso from scratch but bought more of this as backup just in case mine doesn't turn out. It is a very delicate soup and cannot ever be boiled once the bonito is added as it would collapse and the flaovr would be ruined, so I watched videos on how to prepare it.<br />Many years ago when I was in college in downtown Los Angeles, we would go to little Tokyo for lunch and indulge in the then relatively unknown treat, sushi and have the miso and a wonderful salad of finely chopped cabbage and rice vinegar to start.<br />Now I can buy (and do) sushi freshly prepared at my local supermarket and have instant miso whenever I want and that is my idea of Heaven. Miso has the most delicate flavor imaginable, it is absolutely unique, nothing else tastes remotely like it and it is very healthy for you as well.<br />When I went to a fat farm the main reason we all lost so much weight was because the diet plan at this particular place included having a large cup of hot broth before every meal thus cutting the appetite down considerably. I could really put it away before, just huge gluttonous portions, but after finishing the cup of broth, I could eat what they gave us but no more than that.<br />So whether you want in instant soup like no other or want to incorporate this soup into your diet plan, either way you'll be very happy and remember to experiment by adding whatever you like and making it more of a meal.<br />To paraphrase a quote from Benjamin Franklin (re beer) miso is proof God loves us and wants us to be happy. Enjoy!

review/text: I've purchased several different types of packaged miso soups and this is by far the best one I've tried.  It cooks easily and quickly.  I like to pack several packets for vacations, business trips or camping trips because the soup is so easy to prepare with just a little bit of hot water.  And if you forget a spoon, it's okay - just drink it like broth.<br /><br />Making miso soup "from scratch" is one of the things I've failed miserably at every time I've tried, but with these packets I can save myself time, heartache and money.  It even tastes better than some of the miso soups I've had in restaurants.

Tofu in product not impressive, but the spinach is amazing the way it hydrates into spoon size pieces.  The biggest downside is the cost.  Almost $1.45 a cup is spendy for instant soup....Cup a Soup brand (at Amazon) is about $0.30.  And bouillon is about 0.05.  If you are looking for something hot then there are other choices.

I've purchase the EXACT same thing at Walmart for $1.99/package (which comes out to $0.67 per packet).  This company is trying to sell them for over $3 per package (or over a $1 per packet!) - not even including shipping.  I'd do my homework and buy elsewhere because this company seems to specialize in rip-offs.

Plus, how would it look for this old woman to reach shakily into her handbag and indiscreetly administer a sucrose fix from the mouth of the Wicked Witch of the West?<br /><br />All joking aside, this well-made, attractive collectible is an item that's sure to increase in value, is one that Classic Movie fans should own, and for all OZ devotees, why it's, shall we say... indispensible?

I am amazed at how soft, shiny and silky the kitties coats have become since I started feeding them purina one. I highly recomend it. My jasmine even seems happier and more friendly.

review/summary: Very low sodium and delicious!
review/text: It's very difficult to find healthy prepared foods that are low in salt.  Dr. Joel Fuhrman's line of canned food is a wonderful find for me.  I wish it was organic, so I lop off a star for that, but I haven't been able to find anything else like this out there, organic or not.  Most "low salt" foods are really still pretty high in salt, but Vitabeanavegamin is an exception, with only 110mg of salt in the entire can (4% of USRDA).  It takes a little while to get used to low salt foods, because we're all so used to having salt in everything (especially soup!), but it's true that if you give your taste buds a few days to adjust, you'll start to find "normally" salted foods way too salty, and the flavor of the truly low salt foods just pops right out.<br />Nutritionally, this soup is great.  To be honest, I don't eat it as a soup but rather as it comes out of the can, which is very dense (even denser than a stew).  The whole can is 280 calories, with a total of 110mg of salt, 1g of fat, 980% of daily requirements for vitamin A, 70% of vitamin C, and 20% each of calcium and iron.  Even better, there's 14g of fiber (58% USRDA) and 14g of protein.  After I eat a can, I actually feel "energized".<br />Also very good are Dr. Fuhrman's Supreme Greens and Dr. Fuhrman's Moroccan Chick Peas.

They could eat a whole bag that is how much they like them! I am a caregiver to 12 feral cats and every single one thinks these things are the best treats! The feral cats are in a transition mode right now. I had to relocate them to my new home up north. They are in an outdoor enclosed area until they know their surroundings. One part of the transition is giving them wet food and treats so they adjust better. When they hear this bag, they cannot get enough of them! I saw they were back in stock tonight so ordered more for the fur babies. Sadly, my spoiled indoor special needs cat does not like these at all. He walks away from them. But 12 feral cats are spoiled by these and think they are the best! That is a fairly large number and a lot of happy bellies.

review/summary: Best cat treat by a whisker
review/text: This is the ONLY brand our cats will eat. Unfortunately they are getting hard to find locally. I've had cats for 40 years, and since the first time I bought the little paper can of Pounce in the grocery store decades ago, I have never met a feline who didn't LOVE them.

review/summary: Yummy Favorite
review/text: In my area, Pounce Crunchy treats are not easily found--especially in larger quantities. I find that giving each of my cats 10-15 of these small treats daily, reduces plaque build up. One of my cats only likes the Catnip flavor, while the other prefers the fish flavors. I would recommend this product over any soft-chewy treat on the market.

review/summary: Cat loves these treats, but watch the ingredients
review/text: These treats are a favorite of my cat.  I try my best to give him high quality products with no corn or byproducts, but he just loves these treats so much.  They obviously have a delightful flavor because my cat will go to great lengths to get these treats.  tThey are larger than other treats so he can see them better and we can have a more active playtime.<br /><br />We play the following games with these treats:<br />1. Sliding the treats across the floor, trying to get them past the cat<br />2. Lobbing the treat into the air and cat will catch them mid-air with his paws<br />3. Throwing them into the other room and watching him chase them and slide across the hard wood floor.<br /><br />He loves these treats so much, but I feel conflicted letting him have them so often.  I think of these treats as my cat's McDonalds.  The top ingredients are Corn Flour, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn Gluten Meal, Animal Digest and Ground Wheat.  Not good.  However, as I pick up the package to read these ingredients, I immediately get a cat running towards me, eyes dilated, lip licking and meowing- hoping for me to toss a treat into the air.  How can I turn that face down?

review/summary: Cats don't like it
review/text: I have to admit that my cat is a spoiled one - yet, she likes variety in her diet. This is the reason why I ordered these treats, in the first place. However, I was not able to "convince" her to eat it. With plenty of left, I handed the left-over to all my friends who have a cat. None of the cats offered this treat took it. Something is simply wrong here; my cat gets crazy over catnip and she accepts teeth brushing to get another catnip flavored treat (as she gets this one as reward, only)<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049T0DXC">The GoodLife Recipe Catnip Delights - 3 oz</a>. So, Pounce should come up with a new recipe. If your cat never successfully tried these before, stay away

review/summary: it's capri sun
review/text: Wow...I cannot believe the price-gouging on Amazon for Capri-Sun...plus 1-2 other food items I've price-checked on Amazon...normally everything is so much cheaper on Amazon (movies, audio/video equipment, etc)...I just starting buying the Apple Juice Capri Sun for my boys instead of the normal Capri-Sun sugary drinks...a normal Capri-Sun 6oz-10pk box at Walmart is like $1.98....the apple juice is like $2.50...this Amazon item is for a 4-pack...so I'd expect the price to be under/around $10, not $25 plus $14-15 shipping (that's $10/box). You can buy a 4-pk from Sam's Club of the normal drinks for $6-7 dollars. on my way now to Wal-Mart to get more Capri Sun apple juice.

review/summary: A Whole Box of Cinnamon
review/text: Usually, you can only get the Cinnamon granola bars in the Variety Pack.  I was so happy to see they come in a whole box that I signed up for the subscription purchase so I can receive them on a regular basis.  A good snack that's good for you too!  And at an unbeatable price!

review/summary: My current favorite granola bar
review/text: As standard granola bars go, this is my current favorite. As I usually eat them as a late morning snack the cinnamon flavor is a big plus. Not too sweet or chewy, these bars can also last awhile in your briefcase.

review/summary: Can't Find Elsewhere
review/text: Since my favorite Nature Valley Flavor is Cinnamon, I was always disappointed that the stores didn't carry 6-packs in that flavor.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that Amazon did.  In addition, I recently discovered that crumbled up in a bowl with milk, these bars make a tasty cereal.

review/summary: Nature Valley Cinnamon Granola
review/text: Of all the various Nature Valley Granola bars, Cinnamon is in our opinion the best by far! My wife swears by the cinnamon and we buy several at a time from Amazon to keep on hand! Wish there were stores in the Dallas Metroplex that stocked the cinnamon but only able to find at Amazon!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for handling!
