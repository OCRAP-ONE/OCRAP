review/summary: GREAT HOT FUDGE
review/text: This fudge is amazing.  Thick, creamy, tasting delicious.  I haven't had a topping like this since I was a little girl. Other brands have been artifical and too much sugar for my taste. This is definitely a chocolate lovers' dream.  You could actually eat this right out of the jar. I have had it on ice ream, and frozen yogurt. It tastes great cold or hot.  It arrived on time, and packaged perfectly.

review/summary: Mrs. Richardson's Hot Fudge's Agrees with Old Fashioned Taste Buds
review/text: This is a terrific hot fudge sauce! It's the first one I've had in ages that actually tastes like the hot fudge I grew up with back in the 1950s and 1960s. It's the real deal! Smuckers and the other major brands are so-so.<br /><br />I have to agree with BRTIVA. You can't microwave this sauce to the point of being clumpy. I blew it the first time and overdid it. Set your microwave power on medium and let it heat for 15 seconds.  Everyone's microwave is different. Experiment.

review/text: My husband grabbed this one by mistake at the store, he was trying to be nice and bring me a treat so I figured I should at least try it.  Microwaved this for the max time instructed and it slid over my ice cream in disgusting blobs.  Then it had no  taste!  Not worth the extra calories!

review/text: I only gave this product three stars mainly because of the odd aftertaste that it has. That strange chemical/soaplike bitter taste is not there in the canned version, so I assume that the flavour has either to do with the microwaving.<br /><br />Otherwise, I find this think this product is convenient, especially as a take to work lunch and the portion size is just right. Get rid of the chemical aftertaste and Healthy Choice will have a winner.

review/summary: ANGRY AT VERY MISLEADING NUTRITIONAL LABELLING
review/text: ANGRY AT VERY MISLEADING NUTRITIONAL LABELLING  Jan 1, 2011<br /><br />The packages presented, online, or on the shelves at the market, appear about the size of a large cup (not bowl) of soup. If you got a smaller portion in a restaurant, you would complain.<br /><br />However the misleading nutritional info says the "serving size" is 1 cup. However, 1 CUP BARELY COVERS THE BOTTOM OF THE SOUP DISH YOU USE AT HOME!!!! Try it for yourself with a cup (8oz) of milk, and decide whether that represents a "normal" serving.<br /><br />If the REAL LIFE FOR REAL PEOPLE serving size is 1 container of their product=2 cups(=16 oz)),then the sodium is a whopping 960 Mg, 40% of the suggested Daily Value, and FAR, FAR, FAR FROM A "HEALTHY CHOICE"...And that's assumiung you have nothing else with the soup; not bread, not anything at all.<br /><br />This is NOT a little thing, if you, like so many of us, are trying to be mindful of your salt consumption, just as a matter of general health.<br /><br />THE MANUFACTURES REALIZE THOSE AT ALL CONCIOUS THEIR SALT, WOULD BUY LESS OF THEIR PRODUCT, AND HENCE IN TINY PRINT, SMALLER THAN MY MICROSOFT WORD CAN EVEN REPRODUCE, AND "COINCIDENTALLY" ON THE BUMPY, CURVED PORTION OF THE CONTAINER, (MAKING IT EVEN LESS LIKELY TO BE READ), THEY LIST THE FACT THAT THE CONTAINER IS 2 "SERVINGS", AND ALLOW US TO HAPPILY POISON OURSELVES OVERDOSING WITH SALT, this WHILE BEING SO INCREDIBLY CYNICAL AND SLEAZY AS TO LABEL THEIR PRODUCT AS "HEALTHY". HEALTHY INDEED, THE SAME WAY AS A HOT FUDGE SUNDAY AND FRIED ONION RINGS WOULD BE.<br /><br />GOD HELP US ALL IF YOU, LIKE I, MAKE THE MISTAKE*** OF EATING 2 CANS FOR DINNER WITH SOME SALAD TWICE A WEEK, THINKING WE ARE EATING HEALTHIER AND LOWER CALORIE FOOD, ONLY TO LEARN YOU(AND YOUR KIDS?) HAVE BEEN OVERDOSING ON SALT (ASSUMING YOU EAT ANYTHING ELSE DURING YOUR DAY!), SINCE 2 CANS, ABOUT THE SIZE OF ONE "REAL" SERVING OF SOUP, CONTAINS 80% OF THE RECOMMENDED MAXIMUM SALT INTAKE- JUST BY ITSELF... Ans many cardiologists and other internists say even that level is far too high.<br /><br />I AM NOT SUGGESTING THESE (Con Agra) ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE TO CREATE SUCH MISLEADING ADVERTISING & LABELLING, BUT NEITHER ARE THEY EXEMPT FROM RESPONSIBLE LABELLING to permit consumers to make informed choices.<br /><br />BTW, IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THEY USE SIMILAR MISLEADING PRACTICES ON THERI OTHER "HEALTHY CHOICE" PRODUCTS. CAVEAT EMPTOR, AND GOD BLESS THE FDA, FOR "PROTECTING US" FROM SUCH DECEPTIONS.<br /><br />***I only learned of this by reading other reviews which alerted me to the deception. I am an MBA from a top university with 30 years work experience, and do not think os myself as either inatentive or uncomprehending. This labelling, you can be sure, has been tested through many consumer test panels-they know exactly what they are doing.

Remember when the pattie would melt in you hand?  When you grab a few pieces with your hand they don't start melting and making a mess. A few in your mouth and they just taste great and you don't feel the need to eat the whole bag. A few here and there so the bag actually lasts for a good period of time with the pieces staying fresh too.

review/text: I like York Peppermint Patties. However, sometimes I get a craving for a York Peppermint Patty, but I'm not hungry enough to eat the whole thing. It seems like a waste because York Peppermint Patties aren't an inexpensive candy. Enter YORK PIECES. You have the entire flavor of a York Peppermint Patty, but in the size of a M&M. I like to freeze York Peppermint Patties and you can do the same with YORK PIECES. When I bought my first bag of these YORK PIECES, the bag lasted over two weeks. They might not be the best thing since sliced bread, but they are the best thing since York Peppermint Patties (and personally I think they are even better).

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This kit is perfect for those of you who are new to home brewing or thinking about upgrading from a smaller batch size fermenter.  It is just as easy to use as some of the smaller size begginer home brew kits, but it has a few more advanced tools that really let you customize and create better home brewed beer.  The products that come with the kit all seem to be of high quality and everything arrived packed neatly and in good shape. The instructions are very easy to follow and guide you every step of the way. It really isn't much harder to use than the smaller 2 gallon begginner kits. The instructions teach you the process with an easy basic, but tasty, brew. It then gives you a recipe for most of the major styles of beer.  All you will need is an ingredient kit, a big pot to brew in, bottles, and a few utensils to cook with and this kit will have all you need to make great beer.  Cheers!

If you want to "see" the beer fermenting you might want opt for a carboy (glass bottle).<br /><br />Follow the directions and you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Brewing can be done in about an hour or two and it takes several weeks for the beer to naturally carbonate in the bottles.<br /><br />I found bottling to be a real pain so I almost immediately upgraded to using 5 gallon kegs and CO2.

review/summary: Helps to make great beer!
review/text: Have done several batches with this setup and it has been perfect! Sanitation is key with any home brewing, and this setup is easy to clean! Comes with almost everything needed for successful brewing.<br /><br />Only complaint is hydrometer has been off since day 1, however, it has been consistent in how far it is off, so calculating original gravity and final gravity has not been difficult. I calibrate each time I brew. Make sure you tighten the nut to the spigot on the bottling bucket well, or it will leak.<br /><br />For higher gravity beers (1.070+) I would recommend not using the airlock included and instead use the tubing provided and put the other end into a bottle of water or a soda bottle with water in it. This airlock has filled with wort and I almost blew the lid right off of it!<br /><br />Happy Brewing!

review/text: When I decided to become veggie, my boyfriend frowned.  He figured that we'd be giving up on all these foods that he likes.  I made these sloppy joes for him though, and he couldn't even tell the difference!  We're talking about a guy who likens eating vegetables to having teeth pulled.  I figure that he if he can eat them and ask for them again, anybody would like them.

review/summary: Where's the beef?
review/text: Vegetarian Sloppy Joes have always been a challenge for me. Many a time I've combined veggie grounds with BBQ sauce, only to find myself with a sickeningly sweet, and often inedible, concoction. My vegetarian Sloppy Joes have been so bad they'd drive Moby to ribeye steaks and Orlando Bloom to cheeseburgers. Then.... I found the Fantastic Foods Sloppy Joe mix.<br /><br />Fantastic Foods' Sloppy Joe mix is FOOLPROOF. It's incredibly simple--all you need is water, oil, and tomato paste. It's an incredibly versatile mix as well, as the recipe on the box shows (the variation has diced tomatoes,diced onions, brown sugar,chili powder) The result is delicious. It goes great with potato chips and pickles. It's a wonderful substitute for those going meatless for financial or social reasons. It'll please the carnivore,the vegetarian,and the vegan alike. These Sloppy Joes are NEAT!

review/text: I've tried a lot of meatless products out there and this sloppy joe mix is by far my favorite vegetarian meat alternative out there. EASY to make and we easily made seven good size sandwiches out of one box.  Even if a person isn't vegetarian, the cost savings alone (versus ground beef) makes it worth it.  Yum!!!

review/summary: The kids love it!
review/text: When my daughter said she didn't want to eat meat anymore, it was a real struggle transitioning to vegetarian meals we all liked. Tofu didn't work for us.  So I had some doubts about this product, but - suprise - it was good!  All 3 of my kids asked for seconds.  One is extremely picky so this was quite an achievement.<br /><br />The texture is somewhat finer-grained than your typical ground beef sloppy joe but the flavor is pretty similar.  It makes a nice, filling meal.  And for an added bonus, it takes less than 10 minutes to cook.<br /><br />Another product we like is the Morningstar crumbles.

Throw in a handful of chopped green pepper, chopped onion, a squirt of yellow mustard, and a Tbs of white vinegar and voila...the real deal! I buy this for under $2.00 at the co-op and eat for a few days off of it myself. Add a side of oven baked fries, a side veggie, and you have a nutritious economical meal. Can't beat feeding a family of 4-6 for only a couple of dollars.

review/text: I've been wondering how to cut back on meat, especially ground beef, because it is high in fat and cholesterol.  This tastes so much like meat, and is very satisfying.  I found it on sale at my local market for $1.29 a box, so I will buy from there until the sale is over.  Then I will come and order in bulk from Amazon.  I also like that it contains 3 grams of fiber per serving.  I am also going to try Fantastic Foods taco mix next.

review/text: I can't remember what "real" sloppy joe's taste like. It has been too long but I do remember I didn't like it. So, knowing that, this stuff is great!!! I want to eat it because it tastes good not just because it is a good source of protein. Reminds me more of my Mom's mulligan's stew base than the overly sweet sloppy joe mix that used to come in a bottle in the 70's.<br /><br />Update: I have given boxes and cooked sloppy joes for non-veggie and they all love it. My parents have regularly eaten beef sloppy joes and have switched to the veggie version and say it tastes better and easier to digest :).

review/summary: Really Like Taco and Chili Mix by this Company; Don't care for the Sloppy Joe mix
review/text: If you are attempting to get someone to eat a little less meat with out them knowing, I would not make this mix my first attempt.  I can tell straight away that Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Sloppy Joe Mix is made from soy.  It has that distinct taste and texture, similar to meatless burgers, which I don't like.  Attempting to hide that taste with BBQ sauce and cheese has not helped.  The Taco and Chili mixes are far easier to cover up that taste and feel.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this product again.  If you want to give it a try, purchase a box locally, because if I had a pack of 12, 11 of them would be in the trash.

review/text: Fantastic Foods Vegetarian Sloppy Joe Mix, 4.4-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12) I like it so much I ordered the 12 Boxes... Another Great tasting product from the Fantastic World Foods Folks, I wanted to try it for a while and I am glad I did, just like the Taco Filling, followed the Cooking Directions and made the whole Bag in a Saucepan 1-3/4 Cups of water, 3 ounces =1/3 Cup of Tomato Paste and 1 Tablespoon of Oil, bring water to a Boil and added to it, reduce Heat and simmer for 5 minutes until liquid is absorbed<br /><br />Since I found the Sodium a little High for our taste 530 MG 22% (we don't use a lot of Salt) I decided to compensate all that Salt by adding one Big Tablespoon of Onions and another one of Green Bell Peppers to the Mix, very finely chopped that I had sauteed in a non-stick Skillet with two drops of Oil, even though in the List of Ingredients there is Dehydrated Green Bell Peppers and Onion Powder, I though it wouldn't hurt, ...and like Magic it turned into what it looked like Ground Beef and it was Good<br /><br />We do not really eat it on a Bun, well the first one I did, but I found many more uses than just a Bun, I even use it in Pasta Dishes as a Substitute for Regular Ground Beef. I Posted a series of Pictures under the Item's Image, Step by Step Recipe making Whole Wheat Pasta Shells and using Fantastic Sloppy Joe Vegetarian Mix as Ground Beef and other uses as well, Please Check it out.

review/text: This meat-free sloppy joe mix is one of Fantastic foods best products.  I use the expanded recipe on the back of the box that calls for onions and tomato paste and the result is simply fantastic.<br /><br />If you miss some foods from your non-vegetarian life, are transitioning to a vegetarian life, want to fit in more with the crowd at your next picnic and/or simply want something delicious, you need to pick up this product.<br /><br />The texture is pleasant the nutritional profile is good; this is a low calorie meal option that packs on the protein.  My husband eats quite a bit of meat and devours these.<br /><br />This product is also fairly cheap, cooks quickly and makes you feel satisfied.  I couldn't recommend it more.

review/text: I've been eating Fantastic Foods' products for many years.  Their Vegetarian Chili has always been my favorite.  It's high in protein and can be mixed by just adding 2 cups of water.  I fix it up a bit by adding a can of tomatoes and a can of beans and it's as good as homemade chili.  I've given it a number of carnivore friends who said they really could taste any difference than chili with meat.  The texturized vegetable protein looks, tastes, and chews just like hamburger.

review/text: My mom's not a vegetarian and barely wants me to be, because while she understands the ethics behind it, she thinks it makes me pickier in eating. I bought this a couple of years ago when I was living alone and she stayed the night. We cooked it and she was instantly sold, as was I. It was my first time trying it and it was much better than the original sloppy joes or even the sloppy joes that I make with Morning Star's burger crumbles. It definitely has an amazing taste to it, quite spicy too.

review/summary: Excellent Ground Beef Substitute
review/text: The sloppy joe product is pretty good on its own, it has a nice flavor and can fool most people. Not a huge, huge fan of sloppy joes, but I was looking for vegetarian products as meat substitutes, and this one fit the bill.<br /><br />I've also used this as the "ground beef" for chili, and it works WONDERFULLY. The sloppy joe mix blends in with the chilis I make very well, allowing me to make easy vegetarian chilis.<br /><br />Only large issue I have with this product (preventing me from giving it 5 stars) is that it is relatively expensive. So wait until it's on sale, or do the subscribe and save.

review/summary: Is this actually coffee?
review/text: After reading the two glowing reviews for this coffee, I bought a couple of bags, and having tried it, I'm shocked that anyone could highly rate this coffee.<br /><br />I'm not a coffee connoisseur; I'll even drink instant coffee if that's all that's available, but this coffee pails in comparison to instant. It not only has a weak flavor, but the flavor is nothing like coffee. I can't even describe it. It's not simply weak -- it's just not recognizable as coffee. It doesn't even smell like coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps I have a bag that's somehow gone bad or something...<br /><br />On the plus side, the acid content of this "coffee" is definitely much less than that of traditional coffee.<br /><br />None the less, I think I'll end up throwing the two bags I purchased away. I'd give the unopened bag to my local food pantry, but I can't imagine that whoever received it would find it palatable, either. I hate wasting my money like this.

review/text: I love great coffee and I have tried many brands offered here on Amazon. This Lost Art Blend is perfect with the added benefit of being low acid. I would call this a full bodied medium roast, it is very smooth with a slightly sweet finish. Stands up well to cream and sugar too. The beans are not oily at all, they actually look dry like a decaf. I grind the beans about 25 seconds in my Krups grinder for a cone drip brew. I plan to buy a bigger bag while its on sale this month. No stomach or bladder irritation anymore either!

review/text: I would not say I am a gourmet coffee kind of person, but this is one of the best tasting coffees I have ever had.  I don't particulary care for strong coffee, and this coffee is really smooth without losing flavor or tasting watered down.  OK.  I have purchased Barney's Coffees, Starbucks (there are four of them within ten minutes from where I live), and subscribed to Gevalia for a while.  I can always add the fancy flavors with the cream, but this is the best basic brew I've can remember.  Worth the asking price.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />I didn't even know what low acid meant until I tasted my first cup.  If you have a bad stomach I guess that's important.  I just go for the smooth taste.<br /><br />Just too bad you can't click on one of the little arrows like you do in the music department to get a 15 second sample.

If they would just add a bit more chocolate coating they would get 5 stars.

review/summary: Great as a meal or side dish ...
review/text: I purchased this from GoPicnic as part of a package for travel and purchased extras to "try ahead of time."<br /><br />This particular meal is both gluten-free and vegetarian. The GoPicnic Website also lists it as Halal and preservative free. It comes with a small fork as well as salt and pepper, so that you can eat it on its own either cold or hot. I tried it both ways and it was equally tasty.<br /><br />I love the fact that it includes suggestions inside of the package and for our first try I added chedder cheese and heated it, using it as a side dish with chicken. It was very filling on its own, and the cheese was a great complement.<br /><br />If you are eating it as a meal by itself, adding slices of cheese or a small can of tuna will increase the protein, however I would consider it an ample meal with a side of crackers or corn chips, or as it recommends on the side, over a dish of nachos!<br /><br />The packaging lists it as "two servings," although on the go you will most likely want to eat it as a single serving. This would give you 10 grams of protein, 36 grams of carb (14 of which are fiber for a net carb count of 22 grams), and 10 grams of fat.<br /><br />Tasty, healthy, and nutritious. I'm looking forward to eating it again on our trip.<br /><br />*** The one thing I have not been able to confirm is whether this meal is TSA safe. Please be sure to check if you are intending to take it with you on an airline, since it would be very disappointing to have it confiscated by security.

review/summary: Not horrible but below average still - Mfg Origin Confusing
review/text: The packaging is quite confusing.  It states on the front in fairly large type:  "Product of France."  The word "France" appears in several places.  On the back, in smaller type, presumably referring to the little package of "culinary sauce" that comes with the little tin of beans, corn, etc., it states "Product of Taiwan"  and "Produced in Taiwan under St. Dalfour direction."  Then, to the right, this time presumably referring to the tin of beans, corn, etc., it states:  "Product of France.  Packed for St. Dalfour [address omitted]."<br /><br />It is difficult to figure out where some or all of the contents were actually made.  I am guessing Taiwan but who knows.  Maybe the manufacturer is reading this and can clarify.<br /><br />As for flavor, well that is so subjective, it is hardly worth a review.  But, for whatever this is worth, no, it did not taste all that great IMHO.  Very bland.  And, here's something to consider:  purchased this product in early 2012.  The expiration date you ask?  That would be 7/2014!!  Makes you wonder, eh?

review/text: A friend of mine just purchased these for a camping trip. I was curious to see what this product tasted like ahead of time, so we opened one up. Immediately upon opening I was hit with the distinct smell of cat food. How do you make beans and corn smell like cat food?? The beans and corn were mushy and tasted horrible. Maybe its a French thing, but my American palate did not like this one bit. Please do not submit your mouth to such torture.

review/summary: a better lunch at your desk than what's on offer at the local cafe
review/text: Every time a colleague tastes my lunch "tin," Dalfour gains another customer. I find it a bit too oily before one adds the vinegar (which is mild & slightly sweet) based side dressing, but everyone else loves it as is. My advice: add a little water and drain it in the can, then add the packet. The packet dressing is very tasty, as is the bean mix. I like mine cold or at room temperature. If you prefer beans hot and microwave this, you won't need to drain it. Note: I generally like my food without much oil, so if that's not your taste, you should love this right from the tin. Each serving is packaged with a fork . . . nice touch!

review/summary: This stuff is FANTASTIC
review/text: I actually purchased this by accident, and I am so glad that I did!!  This company makes another one with salmon in it that is also SUPER excellent and that was what I thought I was buying this time.  I love both!<br /><br />This is so convenient to keep in my drawer at work.  I think it is so good I can eat it straight out of the can!!  I do love to add a packet of salmon to it or a can of chicken breast to get a little more protein, and for me this is a perfect quick lunch when I don't have much time (or a microwave).  If you go camping or like to go hiking, this would be FANTASTIC for that!  I've also dumped it on a salad at work as well and VOILA- super health lunch!<br /><br />I do feel it is a little on the expensive side, but for convenience and portability you really can't go wrong.  I have put it on the subscribe and save program because I eat it quite often and now it is cheaper so if you do like it I recommend going that route to save some $$.

I am so pleased to find them on Amazon!  I'd only seen them at one other store before (granted... i don't shop stores much now that I'm on Amazon, but i do go out for groceries and farm stands).

review/summary: Perfect for gluten-free travel.
review/text: I have celiac disease and prefer to bring my own food with me when I travel.  I recently went on a week-long trip and brought a six-pack of St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go with me in my checked bag.  It worked out perfectly!  I didn't need to reheat or refrigerate the servings, so they were ideal for eating in my hotel room.  Even though the servings were tinned, they were light enough that they didn't make my bag too heavy.  The average cost per tin made them an affordable choice.  They provided me with a solid amount of protein and vegetables per meal.  And best of all, they were absolutely delicious!  A little oily -- I skipped the additional oil packets after the first serving -- but the seasonings are wonderful.  I will definitely buy St. Dalfour Gourmet on the Go again.

review/text: So Delicious! I purchased the Salmon as well as the Three Bean and Sweet Corn Gourmet on the Go 6pk as a quick, handy, and occasional meal for my toddler. He LOVES them and they have been extremely convenient this summer when traveling or going to the pool because they do not need refrigeration (they also come with a spork!). They do not taste like the typical "canned meat" or bland canned vegetables. They are fresh and full of unique flavor. I have since ordered myself these two varieties to keep on hand at work. I only wish that the French manufacturer, St. Dalfour, would sell the chicken and ham varieties in the US. I'm looking forward to trying the others!

Better warm than cold, but can be eaten cold too. Only downside-cannot warm in the tin they come in.

review/text: St. Dalfour's Three Beans with Sweet Corn was disappointing.  I tried it because of all the high ratings.  I found this item to be very greasy.  Beans and corn shouldn't be greasy, so I scanned the ingredients.  Sure enough they added both sunflower and olive oil.  The total fat content for this little can was 10.  If some of the oil could have been left out, I would have enjoyed it better.  It is nice to eat beans and corn and get your protein and carbs without the fat.  Not so with this product.  Thus it gets only three stars.

review/summary: A Questionable Product
review/text: There is some black stuff at the top of every bottle.  Assuming it is just concentrated mesquite product, I store the bottles upside down in the box it arrived in.  The cook has to remember to pour this seasoning on the bottom of the pan; not on top of the meat.  The mesquite flavor only seems to come out when  the seasoning is on the side of the meat closest to to heat source of the oven.  In other words,  if the cook bakes the meat and puts this seasoning on top of the meat, there will be very little mesquite flavor in the meat.  I learned this by trial and error.
