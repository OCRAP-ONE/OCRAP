review/summary: Wholesome Sweetners Organic Raw Blue Agave
review/text: Of all the agave brands I have tried, Wholesome Sweetners Raw Blue Agave is my favorite.  It has a very consistant flavor which is not too strong and not too sweet.  My five year old son is a very picky eater, and he loves this product.  We use this on pancakes because he has a sugar issue.  Everytime I have used another brand of agave, he can tell and won't eat it. This product is a GREAT deal packaged as two 44 oz. bottles.  If you are using agave for the first time or 50 time, I could not recommend a better brand.

review/summary: Low-Glycemic Sweetener
review/text: Wholesome Organic Raw Blue Agave is the best product of its kind. I tried other brands and even what was available in bulk at a local "health-food" grocery store in my area which had discontinued carrying this product for some reason.  Others must also like it, because it's now back on that store's shelves.<br /><br />I especially like to use it in gluten-free baking; it adds moisture and a soft, smooth sweetness that is lacking in commercial gluten-free products.<br /><br />Yes, it's expensive compared to other brands, but the best value is via Amazon subscription.

review/summary: Wonderful product!
review/text: I have been using Agave Sweetener for about 2 1/2 years. I do not care for artifical sweetners, but with spikes in my blood sugar I had to find something to replace sugar in my diet. I drink alot of sweet coffee and iced tea, my daily serving of oats needs to be sweet too! This product has replaced the white sugar habit that I started my day with. It does not take but a small teaspoon of Agave to get my drinks sweet enough to enjoy with no after taste!! And guess what..this liquid gold (what I call it) will "whittle your middle"..No Kidding! I am a loyal Agave customer and order this product from Amazon.com cheaper than I can get it else where. I order the 44 oz. two pack about every 3 months. I use this product every day, several times a day and its worth every dime for me to feel better and enjoy my sweet drinks.  Nancy In Arkansas

review/summary: Don't Buy This Product If You're Stupid
review/text: If you imagine that any sugar sweetener is significantly more harmful or healthful than another, you're kidding yourself and playing the dupe for one marketing group or another. Yes, this is agave nectar. From blue agave. That's meaningful, because blue agave juice is processed using just heat to convert the simple sugars. You get what's mostly fructose. It is an error to say it's no different from HFCS. HFCS is a mix of fructose and glucose. And of course, it's from corn and has a few more processing steps. Someone warned that it's not a good for you as maple syrup. Wise up. Maple syrup is sucrose. Different sugar, the one in common cane sugar. It's plain weird that people imagine common white cane sugar to be evil but then want cane sugar in their soft drinks instead of corn sugar. Guess what. Sugar is calorie intense. What one sugar does, any other sugar essentially does the same thing. Eat too much of it, and you get sick.<br /><br />So, how about this blue agave nectar. It's raw, which is also meaningful, and not just in a tree-huggy way. Raw agave nectar is treated at lower heat than other varieties of agave nectar. And I think that comes through in the flavor, which is distinctive, fruity and pleasant, and to me, less cloying than honey. It is nearly all fructose, which even to me, knowing that most of the sugar ranting is B.S., has some appeal. This nectar is a pretty useful thickness, a lot like maple syrup that hasn't been overly thickened. Thick enough to coat what it's put on, and thin enough to flow over all of it, unlike honey. If you want to try agave nectar, you can't beat this one.

review/summary: NOT SURE???...
review/text: I was just about to purchase this when I started reading some of the reviews. I've been vegan for about 2 years now and have been using agave as a sweetener for about a year now. Funny... that's about the same time that I started gaining weight. I drink two or sometimes three large cups of coffee per day and use about two good squirts per cup. When I first went vegan, I lost a lot of weight but about a year later, the weight started to come back... just about the same time that I started using agave. I think that I'm going to take a break from it and see what happens? Besides my horrible coffee addiction, I eat very healthy and get plenty of exercise... no reason for this weight gain... except... maybe the agave? Thank you for the reviews!!! If the weight doesn't come off in a few months, I'll be buying the agave again... I truly do like the taste!

review/summary: Best organic, natural sweetener!
review/text: I have been looking for a natural sweetener which didn't make my blood sugar spike and then crash like regular white refined sugars do. I shopped at a whole foods market and saw the Raw Blue Agave Nectar and read the bottle. I bought my first bottle and took it home. My entire family used it and loved it! We eat it on or in just about everything. We feel good and I don't get the blood sugar crashing moments any longer. My only real problem was the cost. It is so expensive from the whole food stores, organic co-ops, and the organic foods sections from the local grocery store. My daughter looked on amazon.com and found it here at a remarkable price and with a program where they will send it to me every other month or however length of time I need between shipments! Thank you amazon.com! Problem solved!

review/summary: Great product but a little more expensive
review/text: I too really love this product, and will use no other.  However I found it at Costco for somewhat less.  Costco sells this exact same item for $7.75 for two 23.5oz bottles (47 ounces for $7.75).  With 6% tax, it's $8.21 for the 47 ounces or $16.42 for 94 ounces as opposed to $19.21 -on sale- for 88 ounces from Amazon.  This equates to just a little over .17 cents per ounce at Costco, as opposed to the .22 cents per ounce (on sale) at Amazon.<br /><br />I buy an awful lot of things from Amazon (I wish I had stock in Amazon, lol), including high end products, and truly love the great prices, the support for products purchased, and the customer service is hard to beat.  Be that as it  may, I also comparison shop a lot, and this particular product, while much too high at health food stores and Whole Foods, and reasonalble at Amazon, Costco beats them all. If ever Costco stops selling the item, Amazon will definitely become my supplier of Organic Blue Agave by Wholesome Sweetners.<br /><br />If you don't have a Costco near you, the gas may make Amazon compelling, albeit, you need to buy two, two bottles to gain the free shipping, unless you are buying something else to take you to the $25.00 minimum purchase.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Captain

review/summary: Great stuff! Best price you'll find, too.
review/text: Excellent product. Good for diabetics as long as you don't go overboard with it. Add maple flavoring and its a great pancake syrup. Makes great carmel corn; (add a few noodles and nuts) a great sweetener for cooking, use instead of honey in cooking;in short, just use it in place of sugar. Add some stevia and it extends the sweetening power - you can reduce the amount of agave you use. Buy on the monthly plan and you will not find it at a better place anywhere.

review/summary: Sweet Deal!
review/text: Love this sugar alternative. Use it in hot and iced teas, oatmeal, and all my baking. I've been learning how to alter recipes for baking due to the added liquid. It's a bit sweeter than white sugar, so about 2/3 cup replaces 1 cup white sugar. Then cut down on the other liquids just a bit. I accidentally ordered "raw" the first time and love the flavor even more. I get it for a sweet deal on "subscribe and save" too and use it up before my next shipment. It's my new honey. Highly recommend it.

review/summary: fab cane sugar alternative
review/text: I know a lot of people are freaking out b/c they thought agave was a perfect miracle sweetener and it's not, but I love it.  It has a great flavor, it mixes well into cold drinks, is easy to use (more so than honey, which I also love), and may or may not be "better" for you than cane sugar.  It's not some nutritious health food that just happens to taste great; use it for what it is - another form of sugar.  As far as quality goes, Wholesome Sweeteners is a great brand.  There is info about their products on their website, including the fructose/glucose ratio of the organic raw blue agave.

review/text: I originally bought this at the supermarket because the bottle is tiny and it would fit on the teeny spice shelf of our Kamp Kadi (campers--search Amazon for it and buy one if you do not yet have one).  But it was love at first taste for my husband and me.  It's spicy and flavorful, unlike some hot sauces that are all heat and no real flavor.  When the supermarket where I had been buying it stopped carrying it, I resorted to Amazon, as I always do in such cases, and was thrilled to find it again.

review/summary: World's most underrated pepper sauce
review/text: I buy a 12-pack at a time, and give half away.  Almost everyone I have given the sauce to love it for the same reasons I do - it's much more flavorful than hot. The last person I gave some to called me after a few days and said he was using it all of the time, it was so good. It has a mild heat, but it adds enormously to the flavor of bowls of soup or gumbo, ribs, hamburgers, jambalaya, stew.  And it's inexpensive.  But be a comparative shopper, as I have found it as high as $5 a bottle on-line. Shouldn't be more than $2 per bottle, with shipping. I forgive Chef Paul for "blackening" Creole/Cajun food just for this "magic" pepper sauce. And, yes, I am from south Louisiana.

review/summary: Not for Everyone - very unique!
review/text: We picked this up randomly in the loose tea section, and found it to be a very strong yet enjoyable tea.  This would be best served as a breakfast tea in colder weather.  To sweeten, use honey (sugars or substitutes won't taste right) and add some lemon for a very nice touch (we used lemon flavored honey which was perfect).<br /><br />The aroma and flavor are reminiscent of aged pipe tobacco.  This isn't something that appeals to everyone, but I haven't ever found another tea like it.  It has a thickness to it that is filling.

review/summary: Russia's "Other" National Drink.
review/text: The Russian tea tradition began with the powerful Romanov dynasty -- although not with Mikhail Feodorovich Romanov (1596 - 1645), the dynasty's founder and first czar, but strictly speaking with his ambassador to the court of the Mogul emperor of North India, who was offered tea as a gift to his master ... and declined, concluding that Czar Mikhail would have no use for it anyway. Thus, only after Russia and China had signed a border agreement in 1689 (the treaty of Nerchinsk), which reduced all trade between the two countries to a single trading post essentially in the middle of nowhere, tea was introduced into Russia along with cotton, silk and other Chinese merchandise, and soon acquired substantial popularity. After 1700, over 600 camel loads or 350,000 pounds of tea annually made their way from that remote trading post to St. Petersburg, taking almost a year to cover the distance of 4000 miles. Although due to the hardships involved in its importation tea was originally too expensive for ordinary Russians to afford, Czarina Elizabeth initiated a regular private tea caravan, and by the time of the death of Catherine the Great in 1796 -- roughly a century after the treaty of Nerchinsk -- Russian tea consumption had increased tenfold, rivaling vodka in status as the empire's national drink; and Russian culture had been enriched by the invention of the samovar, a nomad firepot specifically adapted to heat tea. Unlike the brick tea bought for Siberia, the Caravan Tea (loose leaf tea) imported for the Russian aristocracy further continued to grow in popularity during the first half of the 19th century; by 1830, caravans included as many as 10,000 camels.<br /><br />Traditionally, Caravan Tea is a blend of Chinese (and these days, frequently also Indian and/or Ceylonese) teas with a warm aroma and a note of Assam-style maltiness. Depending on the blend, often it also has a certain toasty flavor derived from the inclusion of Lapsang Souchong, that famous cypress or pine wood-smoked tea from China's Fujian province, which is a perennial favorite with the "single malt and cigars" crowd of English clubs and drawing rooms. This is certainly no tea for the weak-hearted ... but for an early morning kick-start, or after an all too short night, there's hardly anything better. Enjoy!

review/text: I love tea.  I have at least 10 different types of tea at home at any time.  I rarely try a tea I don't like.  But this one (Russian Caravan) defies all rules - it's so strong (not as in "strong tea" but as in "strong flavor"), it's impossible to drink without some preparation.  One friend of mine calls it "camel feet" tea, and I'm afraid in this case, I have to agree.

review/text: Frey Lemon & Black Pepper Dark Chocolate has not been available locally for several years. Nor could I find a supplier online. So I signed up for the Cachet brand thinking it couldn't be too different. Wrong! Whereas the Frey brand was beautifully balanced, the Cachet version has a very strong dried lemon taste and the pepper burn lingers far too long. I've never experienced any food with such large, hard chunks of pepper. Really, this should not be allowed without a warning to watch out for the pits! The thing I love about the Frey Lemon Pepper Chocolate is that you can't really identify lemon or pepper, just an unique flavor explosion. And then you realize it was lemon. And pepper.

review/summary: Here's an honest review for you guys:
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:54 Mins<br /><br /></span>Sweet Heat is absolutely awesome wether it's runny or not. The new texture had surprised me and I wasn't 100% sure that I'm going to like the change, but I tasted it and my taste buds became just as ecstatic as they did before - no difference in flavor whatsoever. I must say those two most recent reviews upset me a lot and I almost thought that my favorite sauce was lost for me forever. I had a phone conversation with the company asking if they where planning to return to the original formula considering negative reviews for the new one. The owner of the company convinced me to give it try, she said that the flavor hasn't changed and it's true - it hasn't, I tried it, I still recommend it to everyone and will keep buying it just because it makes me and my mouth so happy whether it's thick or runny, 99% of sauces on the market are runny and nobody tries to put them out of business for this matter, right?  And if you only liked the texture about this product than I have a wonderful alternative for you: Smuckers squeeze! Who cares that it tastes like grape jelly - the texture is just right, squeeze it on your london broil - make yourself happy))  Now I can use it as a marinade as well, and if you do, just remember to pat your meat or chicken with a paper towel to remove excess sauce so it doesn't burn on the grill.

review/summary: A New Suprise
review/text: After reading the reviews and looking at the pictures I decided I wanted to try these.<br /><br />Compared to Regular Gummy Bears by Haribo one of the most noticeable things about them (aside from the color difference) is that they are about 1.5x bigger than a normal gummy bear. The next thing you will notice different are the flavors. They flavors are a nice twist on an amazing food, but since some of you guys might be worried you might not like the flavors (like I was) I have tried and below is a list of the colors and the coordinating flavor:<br /><br />Pink: Cherry, I guess<br />It taste almost exactly like a Normal Red Gummy bear.  :p<br /><br />Orange: Orange<br />What else would you expect  :p<br /><br />Yellow: Lemon (kinda Strong)<br />Almost taste like a Lemon Head.<br /><br />Green: Apple?<br />I believe I've been tasteing just (to me) the slightest hint of apple.<br /><br />Blue: Sour Rasberry<br />Upon trying them yes you will get a semi-tart taste, almost exactly like the flavor of a Sour Punch Straw.<br /><br />Purple: Pineapple<br />Exactly like a white Life Savor. Yes it might be an odd twist but due to that flavor it is my favorite out of the whole bag.<br /><br />And Again since they are Haribo they will have the extra stiffness most people have come to love about this particular gummy company.

review/summary: Not bad, but the original Gold Bears are better
review/text: I discovered Haribo waaaay back in middle school. I love the Gold Bears - nothing can top them! These bears are quite a bit larger (maybe two of these bears are equivalent to 3 gold bears). I much prefer the smaller size - you can chew them faster. I love all of the flavors of these bears EXCEPT the blue. I had some other people try them too, and they agreed the blue bears tasted kind of weird. There's almost a chemical taste to them. Not yummy. But if you like gummi bears and want to try out some new flavors and sizes, these are great. Just throw out the blue ones. Or find a 6 year old who thinks anything blue is delicious and give them to him or her! (you'll still have PLENTY left).

review/summary: Techno Bears
review/text: I think I like the original 'bears' better than these. Technos are much larger and require more chewing. Your jaw can get tired after just a few. Some of the flavors are unusual - it is not obvious by tasting them what the flavor is supposed to be.

review/text: being a terrific fan of original haribo flavors i was a bit skeptical about purchasing the "techno bears" even if their name was amazing. my thought is that they would be such a departure from the haribo name i had come to love that i would be stuck with 4.9lbs of gummy tragedy.<br /><br />as it turned out the bag disappeared in under a week with a little help from the co-workers.

review/text: I had purchased these supposed gummy bears in the store and they were great. I figured since buying so many I would go for the bigger bag. Mistake. They are very rubbery, not fresh like the store. I also purchase the licorice wheels which I must say are excellent. We never know how long these items are in stock on a site like this. The licorice was a back order so I imagine they were made fresh.

review/summary: Taste Good, Price is good
review/text: I must say I love these gummy bears. The flavors and colors are fairly unique, especially since they have a metallic shimmer to them. I love the blue ones, they are a kind of tart blue raspberry flavor. They are also super tough chewy like gold bears, but they seem tougher I think because they are bigger in size than the normal gold bears. Also, if your house is a little warmer they are a bit softer. I opened my bag in my car at the post office on a cold winter day and they were tougher than later that night in my home. The only downside is that they are only sold in 5 pound bags, which is a lot for me. I'm pretty much the only one eating them and 5 pounds might take me months and months to finish. I separated them into smaller ziploc bags to keep fresh so I could eat a little bit at a time. The price is great too, comes to about $3 a pound. I highly recommend these, they are my favorite gummy bears.

review/text: As you'd expect from Haribo, these Gummi Bears are high quality and taste great! My only complaint is the blue variety, mostly because I have a strong distaste for blue raspberry flavoring (although this is one of the better blue raspberry flavors out there).<br /><br />Beyond flavor and quality, the 'techno' effect (metallic coloring) gives these bears an added level of interest, making them all the more fun to eat/play with.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'd order this large of a package, but I would get this variety again!

review/summary: So Perfect!!!
review/text: I bought these for the candy table at my sister's wedding reception. These were a hit for so many reasons. First, the theme was peacock, so the colors and slight metallic shine went well. Second, my sister LOVES gummy bears. Third, a fun little play on the name, techno bears at a reception with techno music. This candy had to be refilled the most, it was so unique with all the other "normal" candies. Plus I must have ordered these a month before the wedding and they were still fresh and chewy when opened. I would highly recommend these to anyone, did at the reception with so many people asking where I found them.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: The gummi bears themselves are not as tough as some reviews mention. If you've had Haribo Golden Bears, they are about the same degree of toughness.<br /><br />The packaging I received from Amazon lacked nutritional information, and I was curious what the calories/techno bear worked out to be (don't blame me, some people are on a diet around here). I came to 12.5 calories/bear. My math follows.<br /><br />Haribo estimates there are 665 bears in the bag, which weighs 5 pounds. A pound is ~454 grams. On our home scale, two techno bears were 7 grams, so 3.5 grams/bear. (5 pounds times 454 grams/pound = 2,270 grams. 2,270 grams divided by 3.5 grams/bear = ~648 gummi bears, so the math is almost right). The Haribo website lists the mini Golden Bears at 150 calories in 42 grams, which is ~3.6 calories/gram. Thus, 3.6 calories/gram times 3.5 grams/bear = ~12.5 calories/bear.

review/text: I love the Haribo Techno Bears and was disappointed when Ralph's shut down its bulk candy aisle. I looked all over for them in grocery stores because I really don't need a 5 lb bag but it is worth it to get those flavors and a gummy candy which isn't too soft or too sweet. The Techno Bears are the best gummy candy I've had, so I've ordered the 5 lb bag through Amazon.

review/summary: Even Though It's Pricey The Gummis Are Great
review/text: I decided to buy these on a whim with the 5 pound bag of mini-frog gummis as well even though it's $15 dollars a bag the 5 pounds are pretty big and contain a great deal which is pretty good.  The taste of these techno gummis is also pretty good as they do have a unique flavor than the usual gummi bears you buy at the store,  but I would say the mini-frogs are pretty plain and seem to almost be just regular gummi bears with just a little difference in taste but something I probably won't order again.  I have never bought any food products or snacks of any kind online and was a little worried but the bag is very durable and tightly sealed both for safety security and freshness.  So I know for sure I'll definitely with enough money will reorder the techno gummis again as they are quite delicious and maybe try out those soda gummis next time as well, so if you're looking for a different kind of gummi try an give these a shot they're well worth it but pass over the mini-frogs which while somewhat cute just are to close to regular gummis to order them at this price...

For Amazon's price of about $3 a pound, they are well worth the try!

review/text: Why I would give it five stars: Quick shipment of a quality, fresh, consistent product.  I have never been disappointed when ordering from Haribo through Amazon.<br /><br />Why 4 stars instead?  The one star less is completely due to the taste of the Techno Bears as per personal taste preferences.  I brought the product to the office as a change of pace from the usual gummy bears.  Most people preferred the traditional bears to these as they are generally larger, chewier, and with stranger tastes.  These different tastes did not agree with most people, although I found them to be a nice change (though certainly not better).
