review/summary: Good price, but very stale and tough
review/text: I love sugar-free Red Vines, and have ordered them from another company and received fresh ones - yummy!  These spoiled me for life - I cannot tolerate stale ones anymore because they are so much work to chew.  I had gotten a subscription from Amazon because I don't like to run out, but they seemed to get more stale with each delivery.  I finally gave up and cancelled my subscription.  Back to Twizzlers!

review/summary: You never know what you'll get
review/text: I love these, and they are a great treat as I'm diabetic.  As many other reviews state, some come very fresh-but others are a bit dry and hard to chew.  When you by a box of 12, you may get 12 bags that are not at all enjoyable.  Amazon gave me a refund when I complained.<br /><br />When I find these in a local store, I buy just 1 or 2 bags to see if they are fresh.  If they are I will buy up many more and hope they are all fresh. It doesn't seem to matter what the sell-by date is, some  are just hard to chew.  I have wondered if they maybe get frozen or at least cold in shipment to Amazon or the local store.<br /><br />Bottom line....If they are fresh and easy to chew as they should be they're great. 5 stars-If your unlucky and receive chewy vines, you just paid for 12 bags of near uneatable junk.

review/summary: Buy your Vines Locally NOT through Amazon
review/text: I agree with the other reviewers who say these Vine are stale and HARD. I had been buying these almost exclusively through Amazon and was willing myself to like them as they were sugar-free and a better option for my sweet tooth. After gnawing through the first batch I got from Amazon, I was notified the Vines were not in stock and headed to a local store and bought a package. HOLY MOLY! It's like night and day!!! That's what Vines are supposed to taste like!!! they were SO soft and I could chew them without getting TMJ. I realized that all Vines are not created equally. I thought, "hey maybe my first Vine batch was a bad apple" and lo and behold, my next batch arrived last week....I rushed to open the package and taste the chewy goodness I experienced from my local drug store Vines and NOOOOOOO Hard as a rock! I value my teeth so I am going to cancel my subscribe and save on these Vines. I will pick them up at my local drug store where I can squeeze the package and make sure they are fresh and not going to give me lock jaw. I suggest others do the same until Amazon works out their freshness problem. Maybe my children can use these to make a craft or school project, because they definitely are NOT edible.

review/summary: Chewy is better!
review/text: For the bang you get for your calorie buck, these cannot be beat.  I'm shocked at how many reviewers complained about the candy being too hard/stale/chewy.  I love them like that!  In fact, my last order was so soft I was very disappointed, so ended up opening up a bag and sticking them in a fridge to harded them up a bit.  Then they were back to perfection.  I have also had no issues with the sweetener affecting me in a negative way, however I usually only eat 4 - 5 maximum at a time (the fear of the potential laxitive effect definitely helps limit my portion size).  Bottom line: a great find!

review/summary: Love these, low cal, low carb, fat-free! But extra chewy!
review/text: Only 90 calories and 25g carbs in SEVEN sticks of licorice (and zero fat) - that's awesome for me.  I love these, love the flavor and their fragrance is just like cotton candy (but the taste is genuine red licorice all the way).  Beware though, if you DO NOT like somewhat tough/chew-y/borderline stale licorice, then you may not like these.  I, however, love old/aged licorice, so the texture is pure heaven for me, especially when I have my midnight sugar cravings and I don't want to blow my diet and exercise regimen for the week :)  Great price too :)

review/summary: Delicious, but tough to chew
review/text: This product would rate 5 stars had it not been for a couple of things. First, the pieces are hard. Even when first opened, they are not soft to the chew. Second, they can really stick to your teeth.<br />  Having said that, I would still recommend them for those who want a low-carb sugar-like snack.  The taste is good, and I find myself eating more than one at a sitting.

However, you will get gas and bloating when you eat these so beware!<br /><br />Also, the hardness of the pieces, while slightly too much, is not due to staleness but simply to how they are made.

review/text: I bought these with the hopes I could eat them at the movie theater and save myself the extra calories. I started Weight Watchers 3 months ago and you can have 7 vines for 2 points which is really good. I tasted these as soon as I got them in the mail, YUCK! They are super hard to chew, it took me 20 minutes to chew 1 bite and I thought I was going to rip a tooth out. They have a horrible waxy weird aftertaste that is really bad. My husband likes to chew on them for hours (because 1 will take you an hour to chew!) but he hates the taste. I would spend your money on something other than this.

review/summary: Tastes good but should have a warning label--CAUSES GAS!
review/text: Ok, these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand.  I ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them.  That evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence.  It was the holidays so I didn't immediately attribute it to the vines.  I brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk.  Later that afternoon I was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself.  I have since thrown out all my other bags--these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem.  I think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning "may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence!"

review/text: I went off caffeine about a year ago to alleviate anxiety.  In the process, I have been trying to find a good substitute for coffee.  At first, I didn't drink any decaf because there is still a small amount of caffeine.  So I tried several substitutes.  My favorite is Dandy Blend.  However, there are days when I really want the flavor of coffee.<br /><br />I have picked up many whole bean, swiss water decaf organic coffees and they are great.  I picked this up on a whim because sometimes I don't want to actually brew a whole pot of coffee but actually just want one cup.<br /><br />This product is not only delicious, it makes it super easy to prepare just a cup with hot water.  And it doesn't taste like instant coffee.  I am truly impressed.  This will be a staple in my cabinet now.

review/summary: At least as good as fresh Mcdonalds or Dunkin's drip
review/text: This may be claiming a lot, but mix it right (1.2 grams / 150 grams water) and compare with McDonalds.  Doubt you can tell there is a difference, because there really isn't.  Like most things freeze dried, it is fresher than fresh because flavor was locked in during first-production, and it wasn't sitting on the shelf nasty like.  So it is consistent.<br /><br />It is a light columbian mix.  The powder looks light tan - that's because freeze dried powder is lyophillized - it puts so many tiny holes in the powder that it deflects light.  The real color of the product is seen when you mix it and wait for the powder to absorb water.  A nice, clean, rich light brownish black.  It has the fresh notes of a good coffee.  Nothing too complex - no choclatey or bitter notes.  Better than a great backup, possibly a workhorse.<br /><br />All I ask for is more bold varieties with more complexity.  Good job to the company for this one.

review/summary: Delicious -- really!
review/text: I must admit I bought these chips as a gag gift(no pun intended)for my husband. We visited Scotland last year and he ate haggis a couple of times. The chips are delicious! You'd never guess that they were haggis-based. The thick cut sustains the smoky, peppery flavor. They go well with beer, especially Guinness, and make a change from other flavored chips. Of course, they're not a particularly healthy choice but what potato chips are?

review/summary: Mmmmmm. Delicious! Hard to Resist!
review/text: I do a lot of grocery shopping at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market. They're an English company that has only recently invaded southern California and Arizona. They're quite welcome, I might add. In any case, they carry a lot of foreign products, primarily British, and I enjoy trying them out. For example, they have a small selection of English candies. My wife used to live in London and she says that European candies are better than American candies. She says that they tend to be less sweet and more flavorful. I would agree. So, everytime I go to my local Fresh and Easy market I indulge in one (and only one) of their Candy bars. This trip I bought a Nestle Aero Mint Chocolate bar. Mmmmmm. Good. Excellent taste! And not so sweet that it hurts my teeth. Delicious! I'm going to have to go to this store less often. Things like this are just too hard to resist!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My Favorite Candy Bar!
review/text: For some reason Aero Bars are difficult to find in the US, but they are gaining traction. While some people say the bubbles dull the chocolate taste or that they have a difficult time with the texture, I tell them to try one of the flavored aero bars and not to expect a typical Nestle chocolate bar. They are  also softer to chew and bite into-which makes them better for some people that have a hard time biting into hard chocolate bars.<br /><br />The mint chocolate one is my favorite! The chocolate on the outside is darker and more of a dark chocolate compared to the chocolate in the other Aero Bars.<br /><br />Give them a try and be open minded-bubbles in the mint make the taste more infused and fresh tasting!

review/summary: the only sweetener we use after doing some research
review/text: I have spent the last year, after a long discussion with  nutritionist friend, doing some strong reading on artificial sweeteners, ingredients, and FDA testing results.<br /><br />I won't bore you with all of that as it's certainly easy enough to get with a few hits of google, but suffice it to say there is STRONG evidence that we should be concerned with other sweeteners; even the most populara ones were refused by the FDA many times before (**cough, cough**, lobbyists) they were passed. And with very interesting results in health later.<br /><br />Even Splenda, which says it's made from sugar, is processed and bleached rendering it unnatural.<br /><br />That said, even though I am always concerned about a healty weight, I had concern about using stevia...not because of health...its totally natural and shows no ill effects (it's about to be used in all the major diet sodas in replacement of artificial calorie free sweeteners) but because the early stevia on the market had a licorice taste.<br /><br />Well, that's been corrected...<br /><br />big fan of stevia. I think it's a strong threat to any other calorie-free sweetner and could vastly improve some health issues. Plus the fact that many new studies show other no calorie sweetners can cause real sugar cravings. I debate if this has happened with me...I sometimes think it has though when I have a diet coke.<br /><br />stevia is now a staple in our tea and coffee!

review/text: It is hard to describe this product.  It is sweet, but not overpowering like those 'fake' sugars.  Works well as a sweetener, with one small limitation.  Because so little is required, it is difficult to work with.  I use about a half of a packet for a tea, which makes it plenty sweet.  However, half of almost nothing is hard to measure.<br /><br />It is worth a try.

review/text: Looking for an alternative for Splenda, I found Truvia in my local grocery store. Truvia is granular like sugar, sweetens well, and even causes Strawberries to produce Juice--something that Splenda, Equal and others do not do.<br /><br />So I searched for Truvia on Amazon and found this product as well. I ordered a box and just tried it. Yuck! It is a fine powder, not a granular substance; the packets are very tiny and hold very little substance. It is difficult to dispense over a quantity of food (like a bowl of Strawberries), and gives the food a bitter taste like Saccharine.<br /><br />I'll be heading to the store for Truvia soon!

review/summary: No fillers!
review/text: Before my review, I should mention some good news! "a 2009 review study found that stevioside and related compounds have anti-hyperglycemic, anti-hypertensive, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-diarrheal, diuretic, and immunomodulatory actions." (From Wikipedia-there you can find links to several studies on Stevia)<br />Ok, my review: I actually bought this locally at "The Restaurant Store" and though I don't remember how much I paid, I know it was a good deal. I used to put 3 packets of sugar in my bottle of tea. Now I use only about 1/3 of a packet of "Simply-Stevia" to get the same amount of sweetness. I did notice it had a little bit of it's own flavor, but as my co-worker pointed out, it's just a flavor we're not used to, because we're used to the taste of cane sugar and "corn sugar". I think the people commenting that it's bitter, has a licorice taste, or that it made them sick just put too much in their glass. I made the mistake of using the whole packet my first time because it looks like so little, but Stevia done right with no fillers (like this product) is 250x SWEETER than sugar! (That's the benefit of Stevia--you use so little that there's no glycemic impact) I don't think the other reviewers are taking that into account. Also, the person that compared this product with Truvia doesn't realize that Truvia is mostly erythritol (-a sugar alcohol--that's what makes it granular!) sweetened with a little bit of stevia. "Stevia In the Raw" has added dextrose (aka GLUCOSE! or grape sugar!--lookit up!) If you're looking for fillers and are not concerned about your blood sugar, go ahead with your Truvia or Stevia in the Raw, but if you're looking for pure stevia, I recommend Simply-Stevia--but use it SPARINGLY--it's very sweet!

review/summary: Pretty Good Flavor
review/text: I've tried the fake stevias...Truvia, PureVia, Sun Crystals...the latter is now discontinued and the former two are chemical-tasting and bitter.<br /><br />I've tried NOW (the one with silica)  which is OK, but still has a semi-chemical taste.<br /><br />I've tried Whole Food's 365 liquid stevia, which has alcohol in it and therefore doesn't mix well in my coffee or tea, but which works great mixed into plain yogurt to make it sweet without too much of a weird taste.<br /><br />SweetLeaf is an excellent product, containing only inulin and stevia...but it does take 2 packets to equal the sweetness of 4 teaspoons of sugar in my 12 oz of black English tea.  So yeah, you do have to use more of this product--but it has an excellent flavor without too much chemical aftertaste.<br /><br />Simply Stevia, the one and only product that has JUST stevia and nothing else--is super-sweet and super-condensed... but in the packet form, it's hard to mess up and use too much.  The flavor is very good, very little aftertaste--but you have to find the right amount for each beverage--it takes more to sweeten coffee and less to sweeten my tea, for example.  But it is very good overall, and I'd say you can't go wrong with Simply Stevia or SweetLeaf.

(And, no, I don't work for their company.) Here's what they claim:<br /><br />"Stevia Extract In The Raw gets its delicious, natural sweetness from Rebiana (aka Reb-A) -- an extract from the Stevia plant. This extract is the sweetest part of the plant and has recently been isolated to provide pure sweetening power without the licorice-like aftertaste that many of our predecessors exhibited. All you get is the sweet flavor without any calories."<br /><br />We'll see. Simply-Stevia is simply nasty.

review/text: The Loc Maria crepes are one of my favorites. Everyone I gift these to loves it telling me how delicious they are. They are light and not too sweet, so good you feel like you can eat the entire box in one sitting. I especially love the dark chocolate covered ones. However the merchant I ordered them from, Touch of Europe, via Amazon sent them so late beyond the date they posted it should arrive. I had ordered a couple hundred dollars worth of these from Touch of Europe, intending them to be Christmas gifts. I waited more than ONE MONTH for them to arrive, on the very day I was leaving out town. It barely came on time and made me panic, having to possibly go out and buy alternative gifts to give to colleagues on the day I was leaving out of town! Don't know if it was a postal problem or not but it was horrible that it arrived SOOOOO LATE!

review/summary: Refuting the 2-Star Review.
review/text: Not trying to start an online debate, but I fear the previous 2-star review is discouraging many consumers from buying this product for no good reason. I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked "natural"), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]

review/summary: Worth the price
review/text: Our female Ridgeback pup didn't have the iron gut the breed is know for, and quality lamb or fowl- based foods continued to cause loose, very smelly stool and a gassy dog.  (We measure and feed, wetted, twice daily.) At around six months a friend (and pet supply store owner) put me in touch with his dog expert.  She suggested this Holistic Select food.  We've used both the duck and seafood mixes, but now stick with the seafood mix.  Her stool immediately firmed up to a surprisingly firm and almost odor free (!) state. No more gas.  Her coat is beautiful, I mean strikingly. We've used it for almost a year now.  No fish breath issues, but we're sushi lovers anyway...<br />So, taking all that into consideration, and if you don't overfeed your dog and waste food, the price is in-line.  I got cheap a month or so ago and bought a slightly cheaper salmon-yam mix by another manufacturer and noticed immediate effects.  I'm back on track.

review/text: Holistic Select Radiant Adult Health, Lamb Meal Dry Dog Food came highly recommended by our Rhodesian Ridgeback breeder. The man has done extensive research to find the best dog food available for the breed he so dearly loves and in his opinion this dog food is IT.<br /><br />We first started our dog out on the 'LARGE $ GIANT BREED" puppy food by Holistic Select and around age 8-9 months we switched to the adult version. We serve this dog food twice a day with warm water and add a fish oil capsule and probiotics to it. With his dinner our dog also gets 1 tbs of canned Holistic Select as a special treat.<br /><br />Our Rhodesian Ridgeback is a happy and content dog, his coat looks awesome and up to now he never has had any problems with his digestion.<br /><br />Being able to buy this large bag of dog food at Amazon is awesome and a great deal. The cheapest I can find this dog food in a local store is $50 and then I have to drive to and from the store and haul the big bag myself. Thank to Amazon this huge bag is now delivered at my doorstep.

review/text: To DS Rizzi<br /><br />You might want to consider some other venue for your [yes, justifiable] rant on conventional dog foods...but please don't leave a low rating here when you aren't even referring to this product. This is an excellent dog food with high-quality ingredients and does not deserve your "wrathful" generalizations. It has changed my mini-schnauzer's life...no more itching, biting, or scratching from allergies, and no GI problems or loose stools [unless she gets into the cat food.] She likes the duck version the best, has almost stopped begging for human food, and we have gotten her quickly back to her ideal weight. She will eat a few kibbles at a time now--like she is enjoying and savoring her food--instead of just sucking it down like a Hoover. I am inclined to attribute that to the nutritional value of this food and its ability to actually supply her body with what it needs.

review/summary: It all comes down to reading the ingredient label.
review/text: Selecting a healthy dog food is just like selecting healthy food for yourself:  You have to read the label.  You're want specifically named sources of protein like "chicken" or "chicken meal" and  you do not want things like "meat byproduct."  You also want to avoid corn or soy, which is used as a filler to make the volume of the dog food appear greater to the human feeding the dog, but since dogs can't digest corn, it comes out the other end at best and causes digestive tract problems at worst.  Neither the "Holistic"label nor the relatively high price is what makes this dog food a good dog food.  It comes down to the ingredients:<br /><br />Lamb Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground White Rice, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Oatmeal, Dried Beet Pulp, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Carrots, Sun-Cured Alfalfa, Peas, Potassium Chloride, Organic Quinoa, Apples, Blueberries, Cranberries, Dried Kelp, Taurine, Yucca Schidigera Extract, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Beta-Carotene, Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Inulin, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />Hey, if I wasn't a vegetarian I may even consider eating this stuff (don't try this at home, kids).<br /><br />I have two dogs: a 65 lb. senior husky and a 25 lb. young jack russell mix.  I admit, this food is expensive compared to grocery store brands BUT I have found that it is worth it because it cuts expenses in the long run.  For example:  (1) You feed less.  My husky eats about 2.25 cups a day of this food.  If we were to feed her one of the vet brands or grocery brands she would need to eat almost twice that much.  (2) Your dogs will have fewer health problems to treat.  When my jack russell mix started having runny, bloody stools, the vet  diagnosed him with colitis and put him on a prescription vet brand dog food, the first ingredient of which was CORN.  When that didn't work, she continued him on the diet and prescribed medication.  I suspected he may have a corn allergy so I switched him to the chicken formula Holistic Select.  Within 24 hours my dog returned to solid, blood-free stool. I never gave him the medication and he switched vets after that.  (3) This food was not subject to the recall of bad food that sickened so many dogs a few years ago.<br /><br />It is worth noting that this dog food is not grain free, which many dogs benefit from.  For that I recommend Innova Evo, which is what I used to feed my husky when she was younger and more active.  This has fewer calories for the more sedentary pup she's become.

review/summary: For a dog with sensitivity to chicken...
review/text: Living on an island with very limited access to premium dog foods, I rely heavily on ordering from Amazon and especially the Super Saver Shipping to make taking care of our pets affordable.  Recently, Amazon stopped offering SSS on a lot of the dog foods that I had loved and that were really working for my 40# mixed breed dog who is sensitive to chicken.  Since the cost of most of those foods doubled because of shipping, I decided to try Holistic Select to mix with her grain-free, venison- and fish-based foods to extend our supply.  She's been doing really well for the last three months on a blend of half Holistic Select, and half higher-quality foods.  She seems to really enjoy her meals still, so the taste must be okay.  I understand that there is some chicken in this food, but it is not a top ingredient and she hasn't had many problems from it.  I have noticed that she requires a bit more food now than before, and her waste is "bulkier," too, so it is apparent to me that there are more fillers in this food than I would like.  However, it has been a very good solution for us while we work on an alternative source of the foods we would prefer.  It has also worked very well for a friend who wanted to find a healthier food than she could find at the supermarkets, but isn't ready to make the leap to premium pet foods.  Her dog has been very happy and seems to be thriving since the change.

review/summary: Great food for a dog with a sensitive stomach
review/text: My dog had minor GI system issues and wasn't excited about her food, but when she went to my parents' house she'd steal their dogs' Duck Meal food (my parents had switched to it because their lab had allergies and the vet suggested it). Once I switched to Holistic Select, her GI issues were gone and now she gobbles it up as soon as it hits the bowl. I never intended to buy fancy food for my pet, but it's also nice to know her food doesn't have scary additives in it. This brand can be hard to find in normal pet stores so I'm glad Amazon sells it and with SuperSaver shipping!

review/summary: Best for my dog, K-9 first responders use this
review/text: I researched for the healthiest, least filler type food.  I live in the Washington, DC area where there are lots of police K-9 dog owners.  They recommend the Holistic.  It turns out that you can serve much less for the same amount of nutrition as all the other popular brands so 30lb. goes for two months for my 45 lb dog!  I keep ordering online from Amazon and my ordering records show an order every two months.  Shows up in two days delivered! The veterinarian always comments on my dog's healthy coat and leanness. I only wish it could be on the subscription feature so that it would automatically be ordered and worry free, but there are more important things in life to worry about, right!?

review/text: I've never used this product before, but had a coupon so thought it would be worth trying, I looked at their site and checked to make sure that the protein was still adequate (which was 28%), when I got to the store, they received new bags, which is now only 22% protein, which is not enough meat to grain ratio. Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped.

review/summary: Excellent product!
review/text: I adopted a pug several months ago. I was told that she suffered from "itchy butt" which is common in pugs. I was given some allergy pills and told I should give them to her whenever I noticed her trying to scratch herself. I'm not really the type of person who likes to dish out the meds if they aren't really needed so, I figured I would try to change her diet and see if that helped. My  veterinarian recommended that fish oils might help with the itchiness. After doing a lot of research online I decided to give Holsitic Selects a shot. I used to have boxers and always fed them Eagle Pack which they did very well on so I thought this sister brand would be a safe bet. It turns out that it was. My dog loves the food and has not needed any kind of allergy pill in months. People are always commenting on how soft her coat is too. I have also started giving their feline formula to our cats who seem to enjoy it as well. Another great thing about this food is that it is made in the USA and they use all USA grown ingredients which was a huge reason why I chose them. Also, if you join their online community they send you coupons every month for $3-$5 off a bag of dry food and a few $$$ off of wet food or treats too.

review/text: Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars.

review/summary: Excellent Quality; my dogs LOVE it!
review/text: I have 5-7 dogs at any given time, sometimes feeding as many as 4 different foods at once. I show dogs in AKC conformation and foster rescue dogs. I look for a high-grade kibble that meets each of their dietary needs, keeps them in optimal condition (skin/coat) and most importantly, that they will eat! I have one dog that will only eat small bites, and several other dogs that are FINICKY.  I tried it on a whim (can you say SALE) and now I LOVE LOVE LOVE this food...Sure, it may seem expensive, but I believe if you feed a high-quality food you save money on vet bills down the road and help insure your pets longevity.  My dogs look and feel great after 6 months on it. I've fed MANY brands of high-grade kibble over the years, this one takes the cake.

review/summary: Works for My Dog and Me and Try Their New Treats
review/text: My dog likes this food and is healthy. I like that her stools are easy to deal with, which they were not when we tried several other foods. After reading some reviews, I had hoped for a miraculous cure for her scratching and foot chewing, but instead got a slight improvement over time.<br /><br />I highly recommend signing up at their website. They routinely give out $3 off coupons and sometimes have special offers for $5 off (for which you might have to complete a survey or "like" them on Facebook, for instance). Being on their email list has not generated any junk mail for me. They seem to only send out an email once or twice a month which is well within my tolerance.<br /><br />On a whim I bought some of Holistic Select's dog biscuits and my dog absolutely loves them, more than any treat I've tried. She likes them better than Little Jacs. They are maybe tied with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00188ZDZU">Holistic Select Salmon Recipe Natural Dog Treats, 6-Ounce Bag</a>. The treats I bought are not yet offered on amazon. They are called Holistic Select Wheat Free Holistix with Whitefish, Cranberries, Apples & Blueberries Natural Biscuits for Dogs. They are easy to break in half for using as rewards.

review/text: Our Husky/Shepherd mix had ongoing GI tract issues, including bleeding out of the rectum and very seriously inflamed lower GI tract (as viewed on a scope). Poor little guy went through so many drugs, and "prescription" alergy-dog-foods and just could not seem to solve it.<br /><br />Then researched Eagle Pack and moved him onto this as it was heavily fed by Northern dog racers with similar breeds to ours.<br />"Eagle Pack" was prior brand name before it changed over to "Holistic Select" - but same product.<br /><br />GI issues went away, and our troubled-eater, barfer, bloody-diarrhea pooch is now healthy, happy, and has a great appetite and energy. Yes, it is more expensive, but if you compare the ingredients they are top notch.<br /><br />I cannot say enough about this dry food for solving these issues.

I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.

review/summary: Changed the ingredients to now include meat products! ZERO STARS
review/text: We discovered in puppyhood that our boxer was allergic to chicken, beef and pork and had to be restricted to a fish- and vegetable-based diet. He has been on the veterinarian-recommended Eagle Pack anchovy, etc. fish-only dry food for eight years... his entire life, and with fabulous results. We noticed recently that his allergies were acting up. I just sat down to order another 30-lb. bag and while price-comparing, the ingredients list caught my eye: They now include chicken and pork products! How can you advertise that this food is good for dogs with allergies and digestive issues when you start including the very ingredients to the food we owners turn to in order to AVOID the allergic reactions and digestive issues? I gladly paid top-dollar for this food, even when the price increased during the recalls of other brands over the past few years (NOTE: This brand was unaffected), because I was glad and thankful to be secure in my knowledge that I was protecting my dog's well-being with a trusted company who seemed dedicated to serving this smaller market for special-needs food. I suspect Eagle Pack is trying to cut costs by decreasing the amount of fish-based ingredients and substituting the less-costly poultry and pork. I can no longer trust this company since they have clearly put canine health far behind their bottom line. I also suspect their corporate attorney approved the change due to some loophole(s) in truth-in-advertising laws. Did they think consumers such as myself would not notice?? We pay top-dollar for this type of food because we need it! Heaven forbid a beloved pet has a severe reaction or dies as a result of this. How long have I and other owners been putting our dogs' health at risk?? I just hope I can find another fish-based dry food without poultry, pork or beef products. There are so few, this is another reason I am baffled... Eagle Pack had this market cornered because their fish-only version was superb.

review/text: We have a corgi and this kibble is one of the only two things that the breeder recommended. Unfortunately our dog does not like this food. He would NEVER eat a pellet on its own. We always have to mix it with real food and even then he sometimes refuses to eat it. On top of that none of the pet shops in our area carry this food so overall big PITA.<br /><br />We are still ordering from Amazon but looking for an alternative.

review/summary: Mold?
review/text: Ingredients and reviews look good. However, this is the first time I've ever found mold in my dog food. I have a specific container that I put my dog food in so it doesn't get any moisture. It's even air tight. This could be the best dog food out there, but if the quality control is bad, I won't be buying it. I'll add pictures of the mold or whatever is growing on the dog food.

review/summary: Very Pleased
review/text: I have been feeding my cocker spaniel holistic select for over 4 years, and I have been very pleased!  Recently I have discovered Amazon's auto-shipment of the dog food which is great, since the stores that sell it is quite a drive.  My cocker spaniel has had severe ear problems (as many cockers do) and the vet recommended a prescription dog food, after doing research, I decided on holistic select instead, and his ears are so much better!  They went from "chronic" to just irritated, and the vet was very pleased with his improvement.  He loves this food, and would eat it constantly if I let him!  I would recommend this dog food to anyone!

review/summary: Holistic Select is quality
review/text: I have purchased the small sized bag of Holistic Select for many years.  My cockapoo really likes this food but his Mom likes the quality ingredients in it.  From whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and probiotics this keeps my dog healthy.

review/summary: Amazon has made pet food shopping easy!
review/text: First I love this food. My pup has food allergies and she has gone through many top foods because of it. This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months.  I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy.  Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product. Best thing I've done for my dogs outside of rescuing them :)

review/text: Our dogs have been on Holistic Select for 3 years now, and we are very happy with it.  The ingredients are well balanced, natural and healthy.  Our dogs have shown a marked improvement in overall health, coat, energy and weight since switching to Holistic Select from a mainstream dog food three years ago.  Plus, they love it!

review/summary: Quality dog food
review/text: I like this a lot for my 12 y/o cardigan welsh corgi.  She needed a little more protein in her diet and I've added this to the Solid Gold Holistiquez and it's working well.

review/summary: Picky dog likes this as a treat
review/text: I had a sample size pack of three Eagle Pack varieties. (Lamb, fish, and duck.) Last night, my super-picky Aussie mix suddenly decided this fish variety was as good as some of her higher end training treats. I'm not sure how long the novelty will last, but I'm always excited when I find a kibble that works as a treat at class.

review/summary: My dogs got sick off a bag,and cost me 300$ in vet bills
review/text: I have been feeding this brand to my bulldogs for 2 years.  Petco stop carring it, so I have been buying from Amazon.  I buy two 30lb bags at a time.. I never thougth it would make by bulldogs sick.  I stop feeding them from that bag, and opened the new one after I had taken them to the vet and they eventually got better.  I ran out of the 2nd bag  so I put them back on original bag, and they started vomiting again..It's hard to see my pupps so sick, and don't know if I should keep buying this brand.

review/summary: Content means less than names
review/text: I want to be clear, I am not speaking of nor picking on just this one product, but like most dog foods out there that have these lovely names, "Holistic",'Natural','Healthy',etc,there is usually nothing to back up claims of being healthier nor of better quality than the less expensive brands. The ingredients often are the same as most other dog foods, comprised of substances of the poorest quality, including ingredients that are not even considered food.'Made with chicken' can mean as low as 3% chicken legally. Generally, only meats totally unable to be used for any other purpose at all are added to dog foods, and often includes feces, talons, feathers, hide, teeth, tumors and worse. Many of these poor grade and disgusting 'meats' are also then soaked in chemicals before being added to dog foods, the FDA's great idea to keep the meat  from actually being used in 'people' food--but I doubt you want your dog's food soaked in chemicals. People truly love their pets, and for some of us, it's all the family we have or certainly the ones that seem to understand us best. I'm working on a recipe that will work well for my dogs, human-grade. In days gone by, we raised our 'mutts' often on just left over table scraps and they flourished... because they were getting 'people grade' food. If you use canned dog food, smell the opened, refrigerated can on day 2,3 or 4--if it smells good, you will know. If not it's rancid--bad, spoiled, musty. We feed organic dog food now, not much more $$ but I don't 'trust' any of them,& try to make sure it's not from China or anywhere but the USA, and I keep an eye on ingredients and smell regularly, and I rotate. Even those with added supplements and vitamins may use those that are useless, poor quality that are not absorbed.<br />Manufacturers preserve with either synthetic or "natural" preservatives. Synthetic preservatives include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate, propylene glycol (also used as a less-toxic version of automotive antifreeze), and ethoxyquin. There is little information documenting their toxicity, safety, interactions, or chronic use in pet foods that may be eaten every day for the life of the animal. Propylene glycol was banned in cat food because it causes anemia in cats, but it is still allowed in dog food.<br />Potentially cancer-causing agents such as BHT or BHA, and ethoxyquin is permitted at some levels. The use of these chemicals in pet foods has not been thoroughly studied, and long term build-up of these agents may ultimately be very harmful. July 1997 the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine requested that manufacturers voluntarily reduce in half the maximum level of ethoxyquin by half. Some pet food critics and veterinarians believe that ethoxyquin is a major cause of disease, skin problems, and infertility in dogs. Hey, who loves my pets more, me or these companies? Hmmm?

review/summary: Delicious Stove-top Popcorn!
review/text: This popcorn is delicious! I love how it tastes and that I don't have to worry about the hulls being stuck in my teeth when I eat it! It really is virtually hulless! It pops quickly and easily on the stove-top by following the directions on the back of the bag! Perfect for those who prefer an alternative to microwave popcorn or popcorn without the hull! It's snack-tastic!
