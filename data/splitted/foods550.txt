review/summary: Easy, tasty, and perfect for the summer
review/text: I go out for Korean food rather frequently, so I've become accustomed to the flavor of ice-cold barley tea. But, I will be honest: it took a few tries. It's very different from the types of tea you might be used to.<br /><br />Anyway, I recently bought this House brand from an Asian supermarket because it doesn't require any boiling. Simply fill a pitcher with water, throw in a bag, and come back in an hour or so.  The taste is just what I was expecting: mellow and earthy, without any bitter aftertaste. It suggests one bag for a quart of water, but it will make 2 quarts just fine.<br /><br />I give 4 stars not because of any flaws. The tea was fine in every way. But, there was really nothing to make it worthy of 5 stars. I imagine one day I'll find a Barley Tea that gives something extra, which elevates the medium with its subtlety and tone. But, House brand is quite good, and perfectly refreshing.

review/text: I bought this tea to drink it cold or warm. Because is summer I drink it cold. I leave the bag tea in the water in the fridge over the night. In the morning I drink it with coconut milk. It fills me up for a while. I do not know how Japanese people are drinking this tea but it is very nutritional.

review/summary: Yummy, nutty, instant iced tea!
review/text: This iced tea is very yummy.  Slightly nutty, roasted flavor. I love coffee and this is a great instant tea for coffee drinkers.  I've also read that Barley tea is good for your skin, in addition to preventing tooth decay and helping with your heart health as well.  I can put the tea bag in a glass, fill it up with water, and continue refilling all day and still get delicious tea.

review/summary: It's healthy and it tastes good too!
review/text: Years ago, there was a Japanese restaurant where I could get ice cold barley tea, occasionally.  They didn't always have it on the menu because of the brewing process taking so much time.  I loved that tea. When they had it on hand, I ordered two very large containers of it.<br /><br />Recently, I read about Barley tea bags, the House-Mugicha Barley Tea, in particular.  So, I found it and ordered it from Amazon,some for me and some for a friend of mine.<br /><br />The order was filled before the estimated time of delivery for both of us.  Well, she loves it and so do I.  Tastes just like that tea I liked in the Japanese restaurant only, I brew it anytime I like.<br /><br />It's so easy.  I just put one bag in a nearly two gallon jug, fill it with cold filtered water and place it in the fridge overnight.<br /><br />I plan to order more from Amazon too and so does my friend.  She is supposed to drink more water and the Barley tea helps her to do just that.<br /><br />Note: This kind of tea has many health benefits besides just tasting good.  The Japanese have been drinking it for centuries for good health.  And... it will cool down the body nicely during a hot Summer day.

review/text: Like other reviewers have mentioned, this does taste very coffee-like, which is funny because it's a caffeine-free beverage.  I discovered this when I read Japanese Women Don't Get Old or Fat.  I went to a Japanese grocery store and bought a box and I took to it immediately.  I plop two bags in a pitcher of cold water and, voila!  Though at the others posters' recommendations, I may try doing it with both filtered water and a dash of honey next!

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: This product has truly lived up to its name and advertisement. My dog had many skin irritations to various dog grooming products. The creme rinse is non-irritating while soothing to his coat. Our vet & assistant staff always compliment how nice he smells and impressed with the softness of his coat.  However the vet office, Pet Smart, Wal-Mart, any many local retail stores don't carry this particular Fresh n' Clean product. Very hard to find. Well if there is one thing we dog owners love...its to have a clean fresh scented dog for more than a few days. This creme rinse keeps him fresh scented & a soft shinny coat for 2 weeks, as if he just left the groomers. Love it! Note, I have an indoor dog so I am not sure how this product would hold up for the outdoor adventerous dog. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Great smell. Strong and last 2 weeks
review/text: I have used this product for about 20 years. Nothing smells better on my dogs.  The shampoo and cream rinse bottles last about a year and I'm generous with it. I  wash my dogs about every 2 months because it isnt easy washing 2shepards. The cream rinse is the real gem. I usually buy 2 rinses to one shampoo. It will make your dog smell good for 2 weeks just like it claims. Sometimes, on week 3 or 4 after a bath I take a hot wet towel and put the rinse on it and towel them off for another 2 weeks of good smelling dogs. They actually like it.  It's kind of like wrestling and petting them. They think I'm playing. They try to take the towel.  In the end they smell good.  However recently I couldn't find it anywhere. So I googled it and found like everything else, amazon sells it.  My dogs don't have allergies and the rinse doesn't make them itch despite the generous amount of perfume. It is engineered to bond to their hair and not wear off before 2 weeks and it works!

I bought the shampoo and creme rinse and they both are amazing.

I love it and will purchase again!

review/summary: Best Conditioner I have Used !
review/text: I have 4 different conditioners that I have purchased for my 6 month old 4 1/2 lb Maltese and this is by far the very best I have used. It makes him sooo soft and tangle free on his medium length coat. The smell is a little "girly" and he is a boy but it smells good. The conditioner can be left in without rinsing, haven't tried that yet.  I have achieved perfect results with rinsing it out and it stays until his next weekly bath. I think everyone who tries this conditioner will be very pleased and so will their wallet : )  Love the low price for a super product ! ! !

review/text: I have searched for a conditioner for my Yorkshire terriers that would not only smell great, but also keep them feeling soft for weeks. Look no more with this product. It's also great because I save water. This conditioner, un like other dog conditioners, can be left in after applying. No worry about getting your pet wet again to wash it out. Put it in, then towel it air dry to reveal extra softness just minutes later. I love it!!!!

review/text: This is the best rinse for dogs that we have ever found. I use it on my Mini Schnauzer and he smells so sweet--and I recommended it to my daughter who has a very SMELLY Black Lab....and she loves it too! Her house used to smell like dog as soon as you came through the door--even though she keeps it so clean--because her dog smelled--there is no doggy smell in my house now! Try it! for 5 bucks it's worth the chance believe me.

review/summary: Wonderful dog food
review/text: Our little girl is 9 years old now. A year ago she was so ill, she would vomit up a lot of yellow mucus<br />and she would shiver & shake most all the time and she became so recluse & go hide under the bed and<br />stay there most all the time.<br />She use to play all the time, she has about 10-12 toys and we named them all<br />when we got home & we would always tell her go get, fish, frannie, bob, tye, and the list goes on and she would bring them to us. Well she even stopped playing.<br />Well I got on the internet and read for hours the reviews on Dr. Harveys dog food and I ordered it last Set 2010<br />and I kid you not, with in a day we had our little girl back again no more throwing up no more shaking.<br />We are retired and she wear's us out wanting to<br />play all the time.<br />I thank our Good Lord for this wonderful dog food.<br />I do not work for Dr. Harvey's and this is writtem by me personally. If you dog or dog's are sick (PLEASE PLEASE)<br />try this food.<br />I buy 5LB and it makes 33LB's of dog food. Do the math it is cheaper then buying the dry dog food with<br />all the chemicals in it and just end up throwing it out because your dog only eats it, because he/she is really hungry.<br />And you save money running to the Vet's because your dog is sick all the time.<br />I did not know Amazon carried this food until I checked it tonight. I have just ordered it tonight from Amazon.<br />I do a lot of shopping here & I love the service Amazon offers to us buyers.<br />Good luck everyone with your little babies.

review/summary: Dr Harvey's Canine Health saved the life of my 5 yr old Yorkshire Terrier.
review/text: My 5 year old Yorkshire Terrier, Molly, was diagnosed with a serious bowel disorder and according to my vet, had maybe a year to live after being put on prednisone to control the disorder.  After much research, I found Dr Harvey's Canine Health and Molly quickly adapted to the food instantly.  I literally changed her over to Dr Harvey's food in one day and her diarrhea problems subsided and have been gone for almost a year now; WITHOUT the prednisone; which would have eventually shortened her life.  With Dr Harvey's Canine Health and some recommended supplements she is well and thriving.  It really is easy to fix and she gobbles it up every day.  I would give it ten stars if I could!!!!!<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B185I6">Dr. Harveys Canine Health - 5 lbs</a>

review/summary: Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!
review/text: All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!

review/summary: Not for My Taste Buds
review/text: I have only found a few gluten free crackers I like, this IS NOT one of them. I purchased these at Sam's Club, much cheaper. These crackers were hard, not crunchy, almost seemed stale. The first bite didn't taste too bad but they left an awful, odd after-taste, similar to burned grain. The texture wasn't too bad, not the usual prepackaged gluten-free grainy texture. My husband went Gluten-Free when I had to, he almost almost anything and he doesn't like them either. We tried them plain, with cream cheese, with cream cheese/olives, in salad, with cheddar cheese, nacho cheese but nothing would conceal the after-taste, in my opinion they were Horrible! I would say it is just my taste buds but...I not 1 of my 5 kids, 4 of which will eat pretty much anything, liked these. We offered them to friends, family, and neighbors but after trying them no one would take them. It could be possible that we purchased a bad batch, there were 2 packages in the box, but I don't think we want to chance buying and wasting another box. After reading some of the other reviews it appears many people love them, I guess you never know unless you try them. We hated to toss them in the trash so we occasionally used them as dog treats, the dogs did like them.

Shortly thereafter, I read the comments and tried to cancel (I hate Splenda for many reasons), but they were already being shipped.  I could have refused the package, but decided to give it a try.  After all, if I did not like it, my sister (addicted to Splenda) might.<br /><br />As soon as it arrived, I opened a stick and added a small amount to a cup of water.  Much to my surprise, it was not bad!.  The experience may have been different if I had used it as indicated, but I normally use this sort of dry mix sparingly.  In this case, it produced a fruity and sweet cup of water.  Not overly sweet - but again, I only used a small amount.  I decided to keep these and use with water or home made lemonade (instead of sugar or honey).  I will still share with my sister, but not all of them.<br /><br />Why 3 stars?<br />Average between misleading description (1 star) + good flavor (5)<br /><br />Amazon, please revise the description page!

review/text: I got this on a Gold Box deal and used the coupon so it came at a buck a box.I read hough the reviews and knew what I was getting.I got the Strawberry Acai and I can say that I can taste the honey ,strawberry and acai.There is a hint of green tea and yes too much splenda.I don't mind splenda but the problem with this product is that like any mass produced item it is made for the masses.The average america is like a hummingbird that is flapping it wings all day looking for the next hit of sugar.Starbucks ,McDonald's,Cimminbon the list goes on and on.The good thing about this product is that I can use it when you go to a place to eat and they don't have any good options for drinks.Just get water and add this do it.I can also take this to Panera Bread and get the free water and add this for a change of pace.Movie theaters with water fountains are another use ,bring an empty water bottle fill it up and add this.At least I know how many calories I am getting and it is better than the favored waters and diet sodas.It is very hard to eat right in this county ,I think this product is an eat better but not right.

review/summary: SWEET!! Tea
review/text: I ordered this instant tea to supplement the blueberry pomegranate pyramid tea bags I receive regularly. It's a quick, great Summer beverage--easy to prepare and simple to carry the slim pouches in my purse or lunch bag. My only complaint is that when made according to the package directions it is sickeningly sweet. I dilute it with more water or mix it with unsweetened instant tea.

review/summary: Much better than their old products
review/text: This product is of as high a quality as Nestea: No artificial colors and no acesulfame Potassium (Arizona teas still have this) only sucralose which CSPI ranks as "probably safe"-- it is probably the safest artificial sweetener.  This product also contains a small amount of powdered honey (a little over 2 grams to get to the 10 calorie stick).  It is not marked as to where it is made(would be 5 star if marked-- I am picky).<br /><br />Mango Pinapple is one of the varieties that contains caffeine, Strawberry Acai is decaffeinated.

review/summary: OK taste but added artificial sweeteners
review/text: The flavor is not bad and much less artificial tasting than crystal light, etc.  There is a taste of honey and the blackberry pomegranate flavor was good.  I over dilute mine (using 1 pouch to a 24 oz bottle) and it is still a little too sweet for me.  Hubby likes it the way it is supposed to be and of course, the kids will drink it any way you give it to them.  It is a better alternative on the go than buying soda or sugary beverages.  A nice alternative when we are tired of drinking plain water, etc.  Honestly, there are not a lot of "healthier" to go options that you can leave in the car or a bag.  Hopefully, there will be soon.

review/summary: Tasty, strong, but expensive
review/text: I like this product pretty well - I have tried a couple of flavors now.  It is strong, so one packet does two glasses, but it is very expensive.  Part of me wonders how much different it is vs. a tin of iced tea powder mix.  All in all, its ok, but I would save the money and buy in bulk unless you absolutely need the packets.

review/summary: Artificial aftertaste weakens nice drink
review/text: I was unsure how "Lipton To Go Stix Iced Green Tea Mix" would taste, I was interested but also a little leery. I decided to wait until I was in need of `refreshment' and not just a `drink.' Over the weekend I was working in the garden, came in and decided this was the time it was designed for.<br /><br />I poured a glass of water, added the powder and stirred. And stirred, and stirred again. The powder clumped a bit and took some work to break up. I took a small sip and mainly tasted the artificial sweetener. Not so good. I took the plunge and took a big swallow. That was rather better. It tasted of tea and the hint of honey and fruit. Not bad, I down the rest of the glass in two goes and was pleasantly surprised. Not bad.<br /><br />Then trouble creeped in as the main flavor ended and the taste of the artificial sweetener filled my mouth in the aftertaste. I do not make a habit of drinks with artificial sweetener and this aftertaste was the reason why. BLEAH.Since my wife is no stranger to diet soda's I asked her to give it a try. She had the exact same problems I did with the powder clumping badly and an even strong reaction to the aftertaste.<br /><br />In the end when you're downing it this is a nice, refreshing drink, BUT if you are not in the habit of `diet' drinks the aftertaste will be an unpleasant and unwelcome surprise.

review/summary: Tastes like Strawberry Kool-Aid
review/text: This completely reminds me of Kool-Aid.  Pretty sweet, no particular green tea taste.  I appreciate that I can have something this sweet and refreshing without a ton of calories or caffeine.  The granules take forever to dissolve so it is best used in a water bottle you can shake rather than a glass you have to stir.  I notice they've added a pitcher sized pack to the single serve lines which I assume would be more cost effective.

review/summary: the good and the bad
review/text: On the plus side, the tea mixed fairly easily without any residue remaining on the bottom - stirring with a spoon in a glass is adequate. That was important to me since convenience and ease in making it are part of what makes me want to buy it. I thought it was very sweet and refreshing, and my husband enjoyed it.<br /><br />On the negative side, it was almost too sweet for me, but if you add more water (obviously) that helped. What I couldn't change was the taste itself, and I thought there was a bit of an "aftertaste".  I don't know whether or not it's just because I just don't like the taste of the acai, which I've never had before.  I think I would have preferred just the strawberry. But if you are a fan of acai I would say you should try this and it may end up being "your cuppa tea".

review/summary: Easy to use and great tasting
review/text: Recently becoming tea connoisseurs, my husband and I are thrilled to try Lipton To Go Stix.  Small packets of Strawberry Acai flavored tea that is simple to use and provide a great tasting beverage.  Simply pour the stix into a bottle of water and shake well, or pour into a glass and stir well.  Drink and enjoy: pretty simple concept that is well known.<br /><br />At 5 calories and 1 gram of sugar, it is a reasonable substitute for other drinks.  Plus, it is decaffeinated, so that is a big plus.<br /><br />The flavor is definitely strawberry.  I am not sure what acai tastes like, but I could not taste any other flavor than strawberry.  So if you are looking for a strong tea flavor, this is not the flavor for you.  It tastes more like diluted juice than tea for sure.<br /><br />I really like this product and will gladly buy it again. A note, be sure to stir or shake well, as the box notes tea takes longer to dissolve.

review/summary: "made with REAL ingredients" (as opposed to imaginary ingredients?)
review/text: When I saw this I thought "Oh boy! ice tea , sweetened with honey sugar and a taste of strawberries". I should have been thinking "Oh boy, tastes like raspberry jello and I can DRINK it". Don't get me wrong, it tastes alright for what it is . Just don't get your mouth all puckered up for tea because there isn't much tea taste to it.  The person who came up with the idea of adding sucralose should be fired. Maybe that was their way of competing with all the no-calorie, low-calorie "water enhancers" on the market but I think they will lose more customers with the sucralose than they would with a few more calories. But what do I know?<br /><br />Anyway, a description of the product. The box comes with 10 little packets about the size of a stick of gum. Easy to carry in your pocket or purse. Each packet flavors 16 oz of water.  Each packet has a little slit making it easy to open and an opening just the right size to empty  it into a bottle.  Dissolves quickly. Decaf ,if that's important to you.<br /><br />The "GO Stix", in water,  were a little too strong for my taste but I emptied one into a 2 quart pitcher of Lipton iced tea and it gave it a very nice, subtle strawberry taste. I think that is the way I'll be using mine. Not what they were intended for ,I know , but works for me.

review/text: I like the drink. It doesn't taste like tea, though. It has a fruity, red in color, taste with a slight after taste probably from the sucralose. I would prefer the drink without the artificial sweetener(s). The drink is already sweetened with honey and if still not sweet enough, I would prefer to add a little sugar if needed. But, the drink is good and low calorie, so a decent trade-off. Also, the mix dissolved easily in the water.

review/text: This tea had a refreshing, fruity flavor that was really delicious. Unlike most other Texans, however, I prefer my tea unsweetened most of the time. So, the Lipton was a little too sweet for my taste. Even knowing that it was honey flavored, I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it is. As a comparison, I like the Lipton Citrus Green Tea in bottles, but it is right on the edge. This was maybe twice as sweet. However, the mango flavor was excellent. Over ice, this tea was great.

I like the fact that it's not all artificially sweetened even though it does contain an artificial sweetener.  At least there is some honey in it.  I would definitely buy these.  I couldn't keep them away from my daughters and my wife.

review/text: Ok, so I tried the Lipton To Go Stix Decaf iced Green Tea Mix, Tea and Honey, Strawberry Acai flavor. While I liked the Strawberry Acai flavor in and of itself, I did NOT like the after taste left behind. It uses sucralose as a sweetener and I just don't like the "coating of the tongue" effect you get from that. I don't drink diet beverages normally, so I might just be more sensitive to the sucralose. I suppose if you are one who drinks diet beverages normally you would probably not notice the after taste that most diet beverages leave. I would love if they made this product with real sweeteners and not artificial.

The honey, strawberry acai is tasty.  Quite different than several of the other packets I've tried.  If you are looking for a way to drink more water without the caffeine, these are terrific.  Many of the tea varieties of other brands contain caffeince, but these are decaf.  They do contain some artificial sweetner which I would prefer to not have, but the flavor doesn't have a strong aftertaste and it does limit the calories.  I would definitely recommend giving these a try.

review/text: For a water-flavoring powder, it doesn't mix too well with water. Unlike other brands where you can just pour water over the powder and it'll mix itself and dissolve, this stuff needs to be stirred and stirred and stirred, and you'll still end up with random clumps of unmixed powder anyway. The flavor is pretty good, but as others have said, there's no real honey taste. It tastes more like a sugar-free Crystal Light mix. Not that is a bad thing, but it's not the flavor it says it should be.

review/summary: Pleasant Tasting, But Not Iced Tea
review/text: To me, if a product is advertised as being an iced tea mix, there should at least be some tea in the list of ingredients, and the product should have some tea taste. Lipton Tea & Honey, Decaffeinated Iced Green Tea Mix, Strawberry Acai (how's that for a memorable name) does have "decaffeinated green tea powder" in the list of ingredients, third behind honey granules (sugar honey) and something called "malic acid."<br /><br />Perhaps that's why this product, which is low calorie (5 calories per every 8 ounce serving) and convenient (just add water to the "to go" packet, and shake), doesn't real have an iced tea taste. The taste is pleasant enough, and this product definitely tastes okay (it has a strawberry taste), but sorry, it's not iced tea.<br /><br />Te good news is that this product is non-fat, and very low calorie. And the packets are very convenient, which is great if you are looking for a low calorie, non-fat soda replacement at work or school. It's just not iced tea.

I would recommend it if you're looking for a fruity tasting drink, just don't expect it to taste like tea.<br />Also, it dissolved quickly.

review/summary: More like Kool-Aid than tea
review/text: I love the concept of a mixture in a small packet form that you can add to water in order to transform the taste. I know many companies have embraced this idea and have branched out from juices to coffee and I think it is a good direction to take. A few of these packets in the side pocket of my bag provides a convenient way to have my own beverage when I want it without the danger of a flask or a bottle spilling on your stuff.<br />This concept I give 5 stars and will gladly purchase more in the future.<br />However, as far as taste goes Lipton has sold out to the sugary sweet guys. Lipton's Iced Green Tea Mix really is more like Kool-Aid fruit punch. For my tasting preference, a 20 oz bottle of water is not enough water for one of these packets. I ended up using half of a packet for 20 oz of water. Using more water with the packet brings out the tea in the drink which is normally hidden by the sugar sweetness in the 20oz water.<br />If Lipton calms down the sweetness level in the packet I would definitely purchase again. It isn't very practical to use only half of the package per beverage.

review/summary: Tasty, portable and decent ingredients list
review/text: The instant beverage market has exploded in recent years - what started with Kool-Aid is now half an aisle at the local grocery store. Products like Mio and these Lipton packets are brilliant to have "on the road". This newest flavor from Lipton is pretty creative, and shows that companies are slowly running out of the basics. The flavor of the tea, honey, mango pineapple is good - the ingredients list is pretty decent (no propolyne Glycol like in Mio for example). One packet is enough to flavor a regular bottle of water, and factoring in the price of both, this makes a pretty cheap flavored water.<br /><br />That said, there is also something to be said for sticking to normal unflavored water, but lets be honest - everyone needs some flavor every now and then.

Both ways produces a good blend of the product with little or no powder left.  I already finished my box, so that is a testament to how refreshing it is. It's a good substitution for soda or if you want something treat-like in your water.

review/summary: Sweetened with honey AND sucralose (Splenda)
review/text: Lipton Tea & Honey Strawberry Acai is an individually-packaged drink sweetener that you add to water in order to improve the flavor. It is decaffeinated, which I especially like, and is pretty simple to use: tear off the top, pour it into a bottle of water, and shake it up until the powder is completely dissolved. What you get is a refreshing, low calorie (10 calorie if you use the entire packet) drink that is an alternative to cola and plain water.<br /><br />Overall, the product has a decent flavor, and you can definitely taste the honey and strawberry. I do, however, have two problems with it. First, the box states the product is "made with real ingredients," yet it contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (which is marketed under the trade name Splenda). The use of sucralose in no way invalidates the other "real" ingredients like tea leaves and strawberries, but it also means that not every ingredient in the drink is *natural* (something people often infer when the term "real" is used). Second, each packet contains enough for TWO bottles of water - if you pour the whole packet into one bottle, it will probably be significantly too sweet.<br /><br />Rating: 4 out of 5 stars. I liked the flavor overall, and will use it in the future. It is a valid alternative to diet cola, and has a more natural flavor than many other water sweeteners on the market.

What is confusing/questionable are some of the ingredients. Among others listed are "sucralose (sweetner), Maltodextrin (corn), ... isomalt". What are these things? Two of them appear to be malt products and the other an artificial sweetner. Is this Maltodextrin (corn) similar to high fructose corn syrup?<br /><br />Also, at the very bottom of the "Nutrition Facts", apart from the ingredients list, 10 mg of caffeine per 8 fl oz serving (2 servings/packet" is also mentioned. When only 1/2 packet (one serving per the package) is added to 8 fluid ounces of water, the taste is definitely watered down.

review/summary: Better than Mio
review/text: A while back I tested a couple of flavors of Mio and found them to be one dimensional and disturbingly artificial. On one hand, while I usually brew my own ice tea for daily drinking, I don't always have it and sometimes would like a substitution. Mio isn't it. Lipton To Go Stix are an improvement over Mio. Mio tends to only hit parts of your tongue's taste buds and lacks a balance and fullness of flavor, in addition to tasting fake. Real brewed iced tea has a broad spectrum of flavors that cover a wide range of taste buds while highlighting the flavors you brew it for. In my case, I make cold brewed green tea with honey and I can actually taste the green tea and honey. With tea drink mixes, though, I rarely taste the tea. Most are overly sweet for me. The Lipton To Go Stix, however, when mixed as directly, is not overbearing in sweetness or any one flavor. I still don't taste ice tea, but the other flavors taste like they are supposed to and it covers a wider range of tastebuds. It does not taste artificial. The 7 ingredients include flavors from natural sources (honey, sugar, green tea powder, hibiscus) versus Mio's mostly synthesized formulas.<br /><br />On the whole, I think I may pick up some of these To Go Stix if I see them on sale. I think Lipton did a good job of creating natural flavors and it may fit the bill as a substitute drink for me.

review/summary: green tea is different
review/text: I love flavored tea, blackberry and pomegranate but I don't love this tea mix. I'm thinking it must be the green tea which is not the same flavor as black tea. I'm not saying I don't like Lipton Tea & Honey, just that I don't love it.

review/summary: Decent powdered ice tea
review/text: I don't like most powdered teas, either because of their articial flavor, the bad aftertaste, their use of certain artificial sweeteners, or some combination of the above. However I did enjoy the Lipton Honey Mango Pineapple Ice Tea, albeit with a few caveats.<br /><br />I enjoyed the flavor, and didn't find it too "chemically" or with a significant aftertaste. It is sweet, but not overpoweringly so (depending on how you mix it). However, I found that following the mixing instructions of the box made the tea far too strong and sweet. I'd recomend starting with half the listed amount, and adding from there to taste.<br /><br />Although some people have stated that this is "all natural", do be aware that it contains sucralose, an artificial sweetener.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the tea, but I would like it much more if it were a bit less sweet, and really were all natural.

review/summary: Very sweet flavor, doesn't taste like tea.
review/text: My kids and I enjoy the flavor of the Blackberry Pomegranate Iced Green Tea Mix from Lipton, but it doesn't taste like I'm drinking tea.  The fruit flavor doesn't really taste like a juice, either. It's very good, but I do wish it tasted more like an herbal-green tea mix with less sweetness.  My kids disagree. They like the flavor and its sweetness just the way it is.  I prefer to drink it diluted to half-strength, so instead of pouring the whole pouch into my 16 oz. water bottle or glass, I pour in half of it.  Or I get my 32 oz. water jug and pour the whole pouch into that.<br /><br />Other than the fact that it doesn't taste like tea at all, the other small complaint I have is that the powder doesn't fully dissolve.  There are always a few small dark pink balls floating around, no matter how much I stir or shake it.  I just tell myself it's little pieces of fruit and go ahead and drink it.  I have noticed that they do dissolve by the time I finish the drink, if I manage not to swallow them down.<br /><br />This is a great flavor additive if you are trying to drink more water, but just can't bring yourself to drink it plain.  It should be noted that it does contain caffeine and artificial sweeteners.

review/summary: One point for the powdered drinks
review/text: Well now, this was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Lately I've become disenfranchized by the sameness of many of the boxed,powdered drink mixes. Nothing seems to really jump out and make me reach for it eagerly; and a lot of them end up reminiscent of Tang in different flavors.<br /><br />Lipton's new Tea and Honey Mango Pineapple is a break from the norm. There is a lot of flavor here, and a lot of satisfaction in its qualities. The honey and fruit combines to deliver a refreshing, good-tasting drink that makes me want another right away.<br /><br />One slight caveat: as with all drinks including artificial sweeteners (sucralose; 5 calories per packet) there is a mild aftertaste. Overall, however, comparing drinks of this sort, this was quite acceptable.

review/summary: Decent taste, convenient package
review/text: I normally don't like diet drinks. I'm one of those that hate the aftertaste that artificial sweeteners have. I tried one of the Green Teas sweetened with Honey by Lipton & was pleasantly surprised. So I decided to give this flavor a try as well. It's not as good as the Green Tea. Obviously, the tea is very artificial tasting, not like their bottled tea. It's powdered instant tea though so I it's to be expected. However, after a few sips, it grew on me. The fruitiness is there but not over powering. The packaging is very convenient. I can just throw one in my purse and pour it into a 16 oz. bottle of water wherever I am. The great part for me is that this is less sugar I am drinking so anything that can win me over in that dept is a keeper.

review/text: First off, I love all of Lipton's products. But especially love these little stix they have come out with. All I do is pour the contents of one stix into a bottle of water and shake. It's so easy to make and there is no mess. Forget about the days where you'd have to make a big pitcher of ice tea and put it into your fridge taking up all of this space. Now you can make individual cups/glasses/bottles.<br /><br />The taste is great as well. You can't even tell that it's decaffeinated either. I take these to work with me and find them very convenient to use.<br /><br />This flavor especially is really really good.

review/summary: Lazy Summer Afternoon Sort of Drink
review/text: I'm not sure I'd go to the store specifically to buy this drink, but that said, it's the sort of fruity drink perfect for a tall glass, lots of ice, and a good book. There is a slight "diet" taste to it, but that could be because I'm not watering it down enough and therefore it's a bit "strong."<br /><br />It's a great drink to accompany a long catch-up conversation with a friend or sit by yourself next to a pool. Either way though, I keep picturing it as a summer drink. I can't imagine it being quite so refreshing if you're wrapped up in a quilt huddling by a fire.<br /><br />The little to-go pack took me a while to figure out how to open. That cut they put in it almost looked like a mistake rather than the way you're actually supposed to open the thing.<br /><br />Watering it down might spread out the taste a bit. I'm more of a raspberry/blueberry sort of girl, but this is a pleasant diversion. If you like green tea you should give this a shot.

I really tasted the green tea and the mango; the pineapple and the honey, not so much. the label states that the powder would take a little time to dissolve, but I didn't find that to be the case.  My only complaint is that te individual packets call for 16.9 bottles of water. I don't always have that size. I would like to see this in a 1 or 2 quart envolope, or a canister. Let me determine how much I wish to make. Would buy again. No artificial chemical sweetner taste.

It even has a nice pomegranate smell when you pour it in.<br /><br />One stick makes 8 fl oz, but I actually used one stick for a regular glass, which is about 16 fl oz and found it to be strong enough for my tastes. There were some little chunks that didn't mix up all the way - I made this in a glass with ice and cold water. I expect you wouldn't have that problem if you were using a water bottle and shaking it up.<br /><br />I'd buy this again, or order it again if I got it as a drink in a restaurant.

Once I got used to it, I found I quite liked it.  This drink is very refreshing and does not fill me up like a carbonated drink would.  I especially value that it is so low cal as compared to my normal iced tea mixes.  The single serve is very convenient but I wish it also came in a bulk pack for the mass consumption I intend to do if our Pacific Northwest weather ever gets warm!

review/summary: Pretty tasty and convenient, but with a slight weird beginning-taste.
review/text: This is a pretty-tasty tea mix and I like the slim profile of the packet which allows you to pretty much stash it anywhere you want until you need it. The "open here" slot makes it easy to rip the end of the pouch open without having to use your teeth, but the hole that results is a little small for the tea to pass through easily, which means you got to work it through for a couple seconds, causing a little powdery mist to form outside of your drink container if you're not careful.<br /><br />At first, I thought it was the container I used to mix the tea in-or maybe that I was using tap water-that was causing this slight bitter beginning-taste to it. But it isn't either of those things. The powder just has a slight taste to it that may or may not turn you off to the drink.<br /><br />Each packet is 10 calories and 2 carbs. It says 5 calories, but if you take a second glance, that's for 8 oz of water; the full packet makes 16oz. If the directions are for 16oz of water with a small bottle of water pictured (like the kirkland signature ones from costco), then can we get a nutritional count for the whole 16oz, please? I didn't dock anything off the rating for this, given that it's printed right on the packet, but c'mon...<br /><br />Overall, a nice little product to give your bottled water some extra tasty kick. Not a fan of that first split-second it hits the palate, but if you're busy, you might not even notice.

review/summary: Just fine as an anytime drink
review/text: Overall, I have been enjoying this drink. It's fruity and pleasant, with a honey taste that comes through pretty strongly. I like that it's decaf, so I can drink it any time of day. I like that it contains sucralose instead of aspartame.<br /><br />I have been using one packet in a large, 16-ounce glass, since each packet is technically two 8-ounce servings. The pink powder smells strawberry-ey at first (sorry -- I'm much better at book reviews than these food reviews!), and the color once mixed with water is a nice deep pink. The granules are big and take some stirring to dissolve, which the package does indicate.<br /><br />Amid the fruity and honey taste (and smell of honey) it's hard to detect any tea flavor. I picked up a little blueberry as I continued drinking it the first time. Could I tell that it contains green tea rather than black tea or any other kind of tea? Not at all.<br /><br />I like that it's low-calorie (though not technically sugar-free, since, as the ingredient list states, the honey granules contain sugar). But I've been avoiding sugar lately, so I'll take it!

review/summary: Better than the Crystal Light Teas
review/text: I love iced tea, and usually enjoy it home-made and unsweetened. Unfortunately, there are some activities that keep me from dragging along a large jar of home-made tea, so I have to settle for the fake stuff.<br /><br />I've tried the Crystal Light versions, and have universally hated the aftertaste, although I like plenty of their other flavors. I had also tried a Lipton version of their ice tea and lemonade a few years back, and wasn't that impressed. This one looked intriguing, so I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I always mix these with 26 oz rather than the 16 oz they usually call for, and at this strength the tea flavor is rather diluted, however the sweetness and mango/pineapple tang are near perfect. Very refreshing and enjoyable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that this mix takes quite awhile to dissolve in water, and it will settle to the bottom if you don't cap the bottle and shake aggressively for half a minute or so before drinking.

I think if you drink some from the bottle before adding the drink mix, it would allow more room for mixing in the bottle.<br />The strawberry taste was excellent, not too sweet and no strange aftertaste. I really like that it is low calorie without artificial sweetner. It makes drinking my daily intake of water easier.<br />The packets are small enough to tuck in a pocket for use on the go. The package has a notch to make opening easier. I will definitely buy these. I would have given five starsnif it was easier to dissolve.

It mixes easily and leaves no residue.<br /><br />My two gripes: Why on earth package a drink mix designed for water bottles as " mix 1/2 package with an 8 oz bottle"? Who buys those? The most common size of water bottles in my section of mid-america is 16 oz. Just stupidity.<br /><br />And, the misleading title of "tea with honey". If you check the ingredients, there is way more than honey sweetening this beverage. How about sucralose  and maltodextrin?<br /><br />So, basically, it's just another sugared beverage.

review/summary: Good but not great
review/text: I love the To Go sticks that you simply mix in a bottle of water!  I've had many different brands and flavors over the years.  The Lipton To Go Iced Green Tea and Honey with Blackberry Pomegranate wasn't too bad.  Both of my kids (ages 6 and 7) wanted to try it too.  The 6 year old gave it a thumbs down but the 7 year old gave a thumbs up.<br /><br />The powder did not dissolve too well.  I shook and shook and shook but there was still some parts that were not dissolving (both in chilled and unchilled water.)  I also don't like that the instructions are to mix in an 16.9 oz container of water, but the serving suggestion and caloric information is all based on 8 oz (Why can't we keep things simple?)  Still at 10 calories for a 16.9 oz bottle of water, that isn't bad.  No fat, only 1 gm - per serving - of sugars.  The big plus for me is the 10mg of caffeine that it has per serving!  I can skip my afternoon coffee but still get that extra little lift to get me through.<br /><br />It also says that it is naturally sweetened with honey.  Which, yea, it has honey granuels in it, but it also has sucralose.<br /><br />Overall it is pretty good as a water enhancement powder.  I would buy in the future.

review/summary: Excellent Lo-Cal Beverage
review/text: This is quite a good product; the beverage comes in easy to mix and use individual packets, and boasts a low 10 calories per serving. But the low calorie count doesn't sacrifice flavor; the brew is smooth and refreshing, if not quite crisp, and will make a fine drink for hot summer days. The drink mixes up to an attractively clear and deep purple color.<br /><br />The predominant flavor is blackberry, which seems to overpower the others. Honey could be distinguished only as a sweetener, not for characteristic honey taste. Pomegranate could not be easily detected. And, surprisingly, there was little green tea flavor, a result which I wouldn't have expected in a Lipton product, most of which seem to have carefully engineered tastes.<br /><br />There is one unusual use for this drink that I'll bet the designers didn't anticipate: It makes a very good mixer for neutral-flavored alcohol add-ins (adults only, please!).<br /><br />I give this four stars for convenience, good flavor, low calories, and versatility. One star comes off for the lack of tea flavor in what is sold as a tea drink.

I like the Tea & Honey Blackberry Pomegranate flavor much better.<br /><br />In terms of sweetness, though, it is just right.

It has a mix of sugar, honey, and sucralose (same thing as splenda) which keeps the calorie count down.<br /><br />While I wouldn't buy this in the future, if you like strawberry, then you might like this flavor.

review/text: Lipton's Tea & Honey Iced Green Tea, the Blackberry Pomegranate flavor this time around, has a perky berry taste I like, unfortunately with the slight after taste of a diet drink (possibly the sucralose sweetener). The ease of putting it in a 16.9 fl oz. water bottle is a plus, and after several shakes, the packet dissolves nicely.  I appreciate being able to make some bottles ahead of time.

review/summary: Tastes great, but contains artificial sweeteners
review/text: This is a great tasting, low calorie iced green tea mix  from Lipton.  It is not too bitter, although the use of sucralose, which is extremely sweet, makes it a bit on the sweet side for my taste.  My wife loves the stuff - then again she does not mind artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />Speaking of sucralose, I was surprised because it appeared that Lipton had actually come up with something that was not bad for you.  However, closer examination of the ingredients revealed use of an artificial sweetener (sucralose), which is one way to make the iced tea sweet and low calorie.  Although this is probably the least offensive of the artificial sweeteners, I generally avoid them like the plague.  Besides, the only reason why I was excited about this tea mix was because it appeared natural - tea, honey, strawberries - how could I go wrong?<br /><br />Each package contains approximately 4 grams of the iced tea mixture - because it is so sweet, you could probably get away with using less than the recommended serving size (1/2 package or 2 g) and it would still taste pretty good.  I might go with 1/4 package. Whatever you do, don't dump the whole package in a glass.  As far as the flavors go, strawberry overwhelms everything else - this tastes like the fruit drinks my children love.<br /><br />For those of you that don't care about ingesting artificial sweeteners you will probably enjoy this iced tea mix - it does taste pretty good.  I generally liked the stuff, although I will dilute the mixture next time around.

review/summary: Great honey flavor for making bottled water more exciting
review/text: Looking for a way to spice up your drinking water and getting tired of adding lemons or limes?  Lipton's Tea & Honey mix adds a flavorful new option already divided into individual serving packets, which makes it easy to add to a water bottle on the go or a full glass of water at home.<br /><br />This particular flavor is quite different from the standard powdered mixed drinks, having a strong honey taste with a light strawberry twist.  There isn't much sugar in it either, at only 2 grams per packet, so it's an option to consider for diabetics or people watching their sugar intake.<br /><br />Plenty of other reviewers have noted there is a small amount of sucralose (Splenda) in here, which is something to consider if you don't care for artificial sweeteners. As the husband of someone with Type 1 diabetes I've gotten quite used to it and find it to be a very enjoyable flavor, so it didn't personally bother me at all.<br /><br />If you don't have time to brew up iced tea at home and want a quick flavor boost for water, this is a great option, and is an excellent way to make bottled water more exciting on picnics or car trips.

review/summary: Good Taste and Easy to Mix
review/text: I drink a lot of flavored waters using the ready-to-mix packets, primarily the Crystal Light brand - I can't recall drinking a Lipton brand but, after drinking this one, I will add it to the list.<br /><br />This packet has a good flavor, although the blackberry (to me) had a hint of grape in it.  I mixed it in a 20 ounce bottle of cold water - the directions say use a 16.9 ounce bottle - and it still tasted just a bit too sweet to be called perfect.  The powdered mix is not as fine as Crystal Lite but a little thicker and coarse, so you will spend a little bit more time shaking the bottle in order to mix it properly.<br /><br />There are 10 calories per packet, even though the front of the box says 5 calories in big letters because each packet is two servings.  That's about the same as Crystal Light.  Overall, this one is pretty good and I think I will try out a few of their other flavors to add some variety.

review/summary: Surprised
review/text: Normally, I hate any zero calorie drink. Artificial sweeteners have a bad aftertaste to me. So I didn't have high hopes for this. Well, I was surprised. This tea is partially sweetened with natural honey so I guess this helps to eliminate some of the aftertaste. This particular flavor is very fruity & refreshing. I poured the packet into a 16 oz. bottle of water and it was great. The packets come in convenient travel size packets that would be easy to stash in a purse or pocket. This is a really nice alternative for someone that wants something fruity & not loaded with sugar & calories. Can't wait to try the other flavors!

review/summary: Quickly dissolving fruity drink
review/text: This to-go iced tea was very easy to prepare.  The powder mix instantly dissolved in cold water.<br /><br />The strawberry flavor is refreshing but reminded me of Crystal Lite or Koolaid.  My son found it too sweet; however, it was just right for me.<br /><br />It seemed more like a fruity drink rather than a tea beverage.

review/text: I am a fan of flavored ice teas, and this one tastes great. I don't taste and honey flavor, but the strawberry is definitely evident. It is more berry like than strawberry flavor. My only complaint is that the flavor is too strong. I could get two bottle/cups out of one packet. 1/2 pouch is plenty of flavor for my tastes.I will definitely purchase this in the future.

review/summary: Delicious - but not as Natural as it is billed.
review/text: I did enjoy this just add water & mix fruit tea. Because of the tea granules it does take some mixing which is not a problem. I was surprised that the drink could have a strawberry flavor that was sweet but not too fake tasting also I was wondering about the strange aftertaste that was reminiscent of a diet drink.<br /><br />The drink touts itself on being sweetened with HONEY and other natural juices yet maintains its paltry 5 calories without the aid of aspartame - so it is healthy right? Well that super sweetness is in thanks to SUCRALOSE an artificial sweetener that just happens to be 600 times as sweet as table sugar and 3 times sweeter than aspartame.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />So the drink is an official diet drink if NOT 100% natural.

review/summary: Review for Lipton Tea & Honey (blackberry pomegranate flavor)
review/text: This is a powder drink mix that you can add to your water bottle. (Each packet is meant to be added to 16.9 fl oz of water.) I think it tastes okay, but it is more like juice than tea. I don't really taste the green tea part. It reminds me of the Celestial Seasonings herbal teas. I tried the drink both cold and hot, and it tastes fine either way. The powder doesn't dissolve as readily in cold water but stirring helped. The only thing I don't like is that even though it claims to be only 5 calories without using aspartame, I noticed that there is sucralose in the ingredients list. Sucralose is an artificial sweetener used in sweeteners such as Splenda, and I've never liked the taste of it.

review/summary: crystal light???
review/text: It seems to me that this "TEA" product mirrors some of my crystal light products. I think Lipton is trying to get a bigger step in this flavored water market.  For me, seeing a name like Lipton on the box would push me into buying this product until I taste it and then I think of crystal light. Although tea is the third item on the ingredient list, for the life I me I can't taste ANY tea.  The first two are honey granules (sugar) and citric acid for tartness.  The third is green tea powder.<br /><br />Another thing that is really odd is that the packet, of which there are ten in the box...half of the packet is a serving. But, when I think about this, isn't that what crystal light is also?<br /><br />Getting down to what I thought of this product...Doesn't have enough tea in it for me to drink it as caffeine. Even when I put the whole packet in 20 ounces of water, it was still too, too, sweet and strong.

review/summary: nice fruity flavored drink
review/text: One thing is certain, they don't skimp on the blackberry and pomegranate flavors in this drink!  If anything, they overpower the taste of the tea - if you're looking for something along the lines of a tea drink lightly flavored with fruit, this one might not be for you.  But it tastes good and is refreshing, especially for the warmer months (a slight false sugar aftertaste aside).  This mix was a bit different than the usual powered drink additives I've tried out there and there's the nice green tea bonus as well (which might explain why the fruit flavors overwhelm the tea as it's not as strong as black tea).<br /><br />Other than the faint sucralose aftertaste, my only other complaint would be that a 'serving' is half a packet - perhaps I'm not familiar enough with these drink sticks to know that you're only supposed to use half (which seems ridiculous) to consider it a full serving.  Seems a way to cheat to get that five calories claim.

review/summary: Kinda sweet, but good when diluted more
review/text: This doesn't taste like green tea to me, but it tastes a lot like strawberry kool aid.  That's OK because I LIKE strawberry kool aid, and I'm not a big fan of sweet tea.<br /><br />Most of this is sugar or sweetener of some kind - "honey granules" (sugar, honey - they added sugar to honey?  Really?), maltodextrin (corn sugar), and sucralose (Splenda).  There's green tea powder, hibiscus extract, strawberry juice solids, and acai juice solids are the flavor.  The flavors work well together, but again, it's pretty sweet.  I tried it full strength with 12 ounces of water, and it was too much.  I poured half a packet into a 20 oz bottle of water, and it was almost the right strength.  The cool thing about that is that a box of this will last a little longer for me.

review/summary: Sweet but Flavorful Tea
review/text: I should premise this by saying I am not a huge fan of overly sweet drinks. This product comes in a box of 10 small pouches full of drink mix. The directions say to pour the mix in a 16.9 oz bottle of water and shake vigorously or pour into a glass of water and stir. It warns that the tea takes some time to dissolve, and it did- about a minute of stirring before it was fully dissolved. It was easy to mix with a bottle you can shake, but it does eventually dissolve. The tea itself is fairly sweet, but still nice and tart enough for me. I preferred to water it down even more than the box suggested and put one pouch into a 20oz. bottle which made it more palatable for me. However, if you prefer your drinks more on the sweet side, I would follow the directions as stated.  There is about 20 mg of caffeine per pouch as well and 10 calories per packet. Overall, pretty tasty little drink mix! Definitely a convenient way to zing up your water on the go!

review/summary: Great Tasting and Refreshing
review/text: My family and I are all tea lovers - both hot and cold.  The Lipton to-Go is of course an iced green tea.  A perfect blend of honey, tea leaves and real fruit solids make it a healthy alternative to sodas.  Each packet makes two 8 oz servings, which have 5 calories, 10 mg of caffeine, and 2 g of sugar.  Although I usually drink a whole 16 oz, I still don't think it's too bad.  My daughter mixed a packet by agitating it in a 16.9 fl oz water bottle, and experienced no problems dissolving it.  However, I mixed a packet in a 16 oz glass of water and had to work a little harder to dissolve it.  That's my only complaint.

review/summary: READ the directions AND the ingredients!!
review/text: I like both blackberry tea and pomegranate juice, so I thought this would be an easy "A+". Not the case.<br />First of all, drink mix packets are everywhere these days. Most of them are designed for a 16 oz bottle and plainly say so. For some reason, Lipton has decided to print directions that say to add 1/2 packet to 8 oz of water. Why? How many people actually buy 8 oz bottles? And, if they felt their product was aimed at those who would seek out 8 oz bottles, why not make the packet with just enough for that? Just odd.<br /><br />'Tea and Honey" is proudly proclaimed several places on the package. Classic combination. Clearly stating ' NO asperatame!". "Sweetened with honey, Real tea leaves, real fruit flavors". But there was a funny, artificial taste. Reading the ingredient list reveals: sucralose and maltodextrin. YUCK!<br /><br />Besides the artificial taste, or maybe because of it, instead of tea, this really tastes like Kool-Aid. If you're ok with that, then this is an ok drink. Me? I'll pass.

review/summary: Decaf, but pleasant
review/text: I know I'm not the only one out there who doesn't like to drink water. I'm always looking for solutions to help me put down more of the stuff each day - solutions that are low calorie, caffeine free, and pleasant tasting. Most of the mini packs of powder feel to me like I'm adding chemicals to my water glass, which seems to counter the healthy idea I'm going for in drinking water. These packs are pleasant tasting, although they don't really taste at all like tea - think of them more as a Crystal Light type equivalent. I also couldn't really taste the honey - I would have described them more as a generic "berry" flavor, but not cloyingly sweet.

review/text: I've been drinking this at work and it is a good alternative to soda.

review/summary: Pretty good cold
review/text: Got my package today so I opened it up then put one packet in a bottle of drinking water then put that in the fridge so it would get cold as thats the way I like to drink tea. Did the same to another packet & water bottle. A few hours later I decided to taste one of the cold bottles. A nice strength when added to a 16.9 oz bottle without being overpowering. I did shake the bottle before opening it of course. Good & tasty. Not too strong on the sugar & a nice mix of flavors. Be aware this will turn the water red in color which is not a problem. I might buy some of this when my box of 10 packets runs out. I'd say try this. You just might like it as I do!!

review/text: Lipton Go Stix are a new, convenient, portable way to make small amounts of iced tea. Flavor, of course, is a subjective matter, but I think the Honey and Strawberry Acai version is delicious. A box of these is a handy thing to have in an office desk drawer, or any location where you'd like to make only a glass or two. Green tea and acai are currently considered excellent for promoting good health. This product is fairly expensive if you want to make tea by the quart or half gallon, however.
