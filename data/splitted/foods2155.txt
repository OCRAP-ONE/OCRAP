review/summary: Best Soy Drink
review/text: I prefer the taste of this Soy Drink on cereal in the morning! It's the best in my opinion. I use it in every recipe that calls for milk. It does tend to make mashed potatoes taste like Vanilla, but I can live with that. When my co-ops stopped stocking this particular flavor/brand I panicked, but I found it on Amazon and have been very happy, especially since I order a couple of cases at a time. Amazon delivers this quickly, and I have never had a problem with their service.

It is also a nice starter for a quick chicken dish with an Asian flair...think bite-sized chicken pieces with thinly sliced vegetables, briefly sauteed, on a warm bed of rice.

review/summary: the perfect kitty stocking
review/text: It took some time to find a "classy" cat stocking, but I'm so glad I kept looking!  The mice are nicely detailed, but not overwhelming, and the fabric is a pretty shimmery white.  A nice change from the typical stockings with a generic cat picture on them.  A great choice for a kitty who is a family member, not just a pet.

review/summary: BEST SO FAR
review/text: This is the smoothest, most delicious, and richest tasting chocolate powder I've had so far. I love chocolate, so I'm always comparing. I thought Green & Black's was the best until I tasted this one. But Green & Blacks gave me a caffeine buzz that kept me up all night and this one did not. I learned there is a chemical difference between processed and raw chocolate. Raw chocolate is actually healthy... and FAR more healthy than processed cocolate. It's full of calcium, magnesium, and is actually a nutritionally complete food with little to no caffeine because it is not processed the same way as conventional chocolate or cacao powder. I love this raw organic cacao powder and am buying more today!

review/text: I love making cinnamon bread in my bread machine with these chips. I don't like the consistency for eating, (I prefer the Hershey's chips), but, these are far superior for baking. Good flavor & they actually make a swirl pattern in the bread.  I'm still not able to reproduce the cinnamon burst bread in my bread machine, but I like the cinnamon bread anyway. (It just doesn't have the bursts in it.) I tried the chips as well as ground cinnamon, but it affected the yeast.  So now I just use the chips & no ground cinnamon.  The flavor is the same & the bread rises better.

review/text: A local bakery here sells Cinnamon Chip bread.  I was able to google a recipe & bought these chips to use.  I learned the hard way that these melt easily.  If you add them to bread machine dough, they will melt making your dough very runny.  Instead, I set my machine to dough setting & after it has risen, I roll it out & sprinkle these on top, then roll it up for a loaf.  Turned out very yummy without the melting problem.  Very tasty!

review/text: Looking at the reviews here you'd think these were straight out of Star Trek- just put the packet in the inflate-a-lator 4000 and out pops a chicken.<br /><br />Kidding aside I *really* wanted to love this product. I typically use canned broth or make my own from scratch, a time consuming process. Savory Choice Chicken Broth Concentrate is not vile by any means but has what I can only describe as a "sweaty sock" taste to it. I've tried to adapt to it but keep coming to the conclusion that my palate simply finds it offensive. The sodium content is also outrageous: one packet, equivalent to 1 cup of broth contains 770mg of salt- ouch.<br /><br />I'd still consider this in a pinch instead of a bullion cube but it's not as good as canned broth.

review/summary: Blind taste test confirms it: This is insanely good!
review/text: Chicken stock from little gel-filled concentrate packets sounded too good to be true, but after reading all the positive reviews for Savory Choice Chicken Broth I decided to throw caution to the wind and give it a try.<br /><br />Mixing a cup of hot water with one packet revealed an enticing aroma and a beautiful chickeny-beige color stock. The taste was phenomenal: enough lip-smacking gelatin to give it body but it also had rich depth and a full flavor profile that screamed "CHICKEN".<br /><br />I pitted Savory Choice against my own broth (long simmered carcasses with fully intact wings and plenty of meat and connectives, carrot, onion, celery, and bay, de-fatted overnight and re-heated to a simmer), as well as Swanson Organic. Amongst my family (admittedly, a too-small statistical sample), the Savory Choice beat the Swanson easily, but surprisingly it also edged out my home-made broth.<br /><br />Combine that extraordinary flavor with amazing shelf-convenience and you got a winner. I'm a total convert!

review/summary: Not for everyone, but for me!
review/text: Having read the other reviews, and having talked to my mother, I feel the need to share my own experience.  I absolutely LOVE this broth.  I find it far, far superior to bouillon cubes in flavor (more on the salt content in a bit).  I rarely eat it on its own however, and I probably wouldn't use it as a base for chicken soup, for which I make homemade broth.  I do enjoy it on its own, but the salt content is high.<br /><br />What this product is ideal for is when you have a recipe that calls for a few cups of broth - risotto, saute, couscous, etc, etc, etc.  When I use it I usually omit any other salt my recipe calls for, and the saltiness of the final dish comes out perfectly.<br /><br />I noticed some of the less than positive reviews don't like the taste of the broth by itself.  I will say, the flavor is very different than many/most store bought stocks and bouillon cubes.  It is very rich and meaty, and tastes like a roasted chicken, WITHOUT vegetables or spices other than salt.  This is just pure chicken flavor, and some may be off put by that -- my mother for instance isn't a big fan - she likes her chicken stock to be very vegetabley.<br /><br />So, if you like a full, meaty chicken (and only chicken) stock, I highly recommend this.  If you want something with more vegetable flavor, look elsewhere.  Personally, I love it.

With that said, my little hometown store had gotten this in and it was a bit pricy but I decided to go for it (At $7 a box from my local store it was a big jump from my homemade or the Aldi Fit and Active that I will purchase (which used to be organic) when Im in a pinch.) I couldnt believe the flavor when I first tired it! I wont use a broth base with any kind of aftertaste and this didnt have anything but CHICKEN flavor! Now i use my homemade broth with one or two of these packets added into about 2 quarts for a SUPER tasting broth! You cant go wrong with it.

review/summary: Good in a Pinch
review/text: I always make my own stocks but I like to keep some cans of broth on hand in case I run out of my home made and have a need for some. The cans take up a lot of room in my food pantry so I was looking for something in a concentrated form and came to Amazon. After lots of looking at the many products they offer and reading lots of reviews I settled on this based on the many great reviews. I tried it as soon as the package arrived and will say that it isn't a bad product but it seems to be in the same catagory as all the others, it has a decent taste but is in no way a "home made" taste. The biggest thing with this is the smaller footprint it requires to store these packs. I will keep searching for that "perfect" chicken stock and will use these in the meantime when I need a bit, the convenience of the packaging is worth the space it takes up in the pantry for me, and all in all it is a decent product but don't think you will be getting that home made taste.

review/summary: Excellent product
review/text: This concentrate makes delicious chicken broth, perfect for any recipe that requires chicken stock. Far superior to canned, bouillon cubes or those aseptic boxes. It's also convenient, each little envelope makes 1 cup of broth. The only downside is that it's a bit pricey, but the quality's worth it.

review/text: Not having time to make great stocks for cooking, I looked high and low for a product that would be like home made.  I finally found it with this product.  It is truly wonderfui, just the aroma when you open a packet smells so wonderful.  I have passed these on to friends and family and now none of them will cook with out them.  I highly recommend giving them a try, you won't want anything else once you have.

review/summary: Really organic?
review/text: I enjoy using this broth in cooking.  It is better than most I have tried.  However, several reviews mention that the produce is organic and I confess that my first purchase was based on that mistaken belief.  There is no mention of "organic" in the product description or on the product itself.  Please make note of that if that's important to you.

review/text: I do not use this for broth to eat/drink, if I want broth I make it from scratch with my pressure cooker so it is fast.  However, I do use it like a seasoning to enhance the flavor of soups like cream of asparagus.  Also i put it in the water for rice, grains, etc.  It is great, I was buying it from Whole Foods but will definitely start getting it from Amazon. And the cherry on the cake so to speak is no msg no food coloring no preservatives and it actually has a good flavor.

review/summary: Great taste and great packaging
review/text: A few years ago I saw a little ad blurb from Swanson broth about cooking white rice with chicken broth instead of water. Intrigued I tried it out and loved it. So easy - one can of broth and one cup of rice. Since then I've never used plain water.<br /><br />I like this broth. It does have a more intense chicken flavor which is not always a good thing I reckon but so far I haven't had a problem with it. It gives the rice a slight tan color that is appealing.<br /><br />I like the fact that I can store 4 (15oz) cans worth of broth in less than one can's space. I really, really like that about this broth.<br /><br />The price is pretty good too on subscribe and save - about .65 cents for the equivalent of a can of broth.<br /><br />I usually buy Wal-Mart's Great Value chicken broth but the taste and space savings really makes it worth the extra 10 to 15 cents. And at about 65 cents it is not more expensive than the name brands.<br /><br />Darin

review/text: Someone told me to look on Amazon to locate this product. It's great as a broth but also for gravy and jazzing up beef and poultry entrees'. The taste is OUT OF THIS WORLD and so easy to make. I inject the turkey broth into the turkey before cooking and it enhances the flavor... added bonus since the holidays are just around the corner.  Thank you for having this product on Amazon.

review/summary: Has Maltodextrin - Avoid if You are Human
review/text: I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in January 2012. I managed to reduce my A1C from 11.7 to 6.5 in three months.<br /><br />Right after I was diagnosed, I was getting NOWHERE. I couldn't figure out why my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to over 200 at times even though I was avoiding carbs and sugar. I would feel terrible when my blood sugar jumped like that and my vision would get blurry. It was extremely scary.<br /><br />Due to the meds I was taking, I was having some gastric distress so my physician put me on a liquid diet that consisted of sugar free jello, low sodium, MSG free chicken broth and water. Still my blood sugar would frequently shoot up to almost 200. I thought it had to be that my blood sugar meter was not working correctly. During this time, I had to have another lab test so when I went to the lab I asked them to test my blood sugar using an actual lab work up and at the same time I would test using my meter.<br /><br />The lab test showed my sugar as 186 and my meter said 183. The head of the lab said that's very accurate for a home meter. By this time I'd been on that liquid diet for almost 2 days so my blood sugar shouldn't have been fluctuating like it was and if anything, due to the medication I take, it should have been on the low side.<br /><br />I later found out it was from the sugar free jello I was eating. Though it says on the nutrition info that it has zero sugar and zero carbs, the reality is that it's full of maltodextrin and because of the way the law reads, food producers don't have to list maltodextrin on the nutrition information, they only have to put it in the list of ingredients.<br /><br />If you look at the label on Splenda (the kind that measures like sugar) you will see that the first ingredient listed is maltodextrin which is a filler product. It can be made from grain but is generally made from corn and it reacts every bit as strongly on the pancreas as table sugar and white bread.<br /><br />As per my endocrinologist those with diabetes, pre-diabetes and a family history of diabetes should avoid maltodextrin. It's hard on your pancreas and even if you are not prone to diabetes but are dieting, ingesting maltodextrin adversely affects appetite because it reacts so strongly on the pancreas. If you eat something sugar free and notice that you are soon very hungry after, it's from the maltodextrin that's most likely in the product as it's added frequently to sugar free things.<br /><br />My endocrinologist said to avoid sugar and maltodextrin but he said if you can't help yourself and feel you must eat something with either one of those in it then choose the one with table sugar because it's effect will be shorter term and less strong on your body than the maltodextrin.<br /><br />I wish I'd have known this before I was diagnosed with diabetes and maybe I could have avoided it or at least held it off longer.<br /><br />There are chicken flavorings out there that don't include maltodextrin. Buy one of those instead.

review/summary: Incredibly convenient, especially when cooking for small number
review/text: Surprisingly good broth, even if not made from scratch!  It's weird because it comes in a tube and you squeeze it out, but once you mix it with water, you'll see.  I love that each packet = 1 cup of broth because when you're only cooking for 1 or 2 people, you just don't use enough broth.  I used to buy boxed broth but it was expensive to get the ones without MSG and I ended up not using it all before it spoiled.  With this stuff, there's no worry about spoilage.

review/summary: Best morning tea, with great flavor, and no jitters
review/text: I have appreciated this tea for over 20 years now, but I have been having a very hard time finding this product for a very long time.<br /><br />It is no trouble finding Celestial Seasonings brand at grocery stores and other places that sell tea bags, but it is a terrible time finding this fine quality tea. If you want it, I have found it difficult to even have the grocery store get it from their suppliers (some grocery stores don't usually buy direct from the manufacturer, but from a grocery supply wholesale companies).<br /><br />Morning Thunder Tea is based on the South American Mate that is drunk in a way that is not easily understood in North America. With regular Mate (I am NOT now describing this product and how it is used as Morning Thunder comes in a regular tea bag) you pour hot water over the unbagged "tea" mix in a gourd cup and then sip the "tea" through a silver straw that has a strainer at the end and you keep adding hot water to the cup for a long time. The "tea" mixture is not used up and can make quite a bit of tea over and over from the same teaspoonful of "tea."<br /><br />This flavor of Morning Thunder contains Mate and blend of black tea in a convenient tea bag in just the right mix. A very flavorful, in my opinion, basic tea. Notice I use the word tea without quotes, as the mate is not a real tea as per definition, but black tea is.<br /><br />Having had a hard time finding this certain tea, I have purchased a plain mate and mixed it with loose leaf Lipton Black Tea for a similar result but certainly not as good a mix and it is far less convenient than this product in a simple tea bag with no string attached.<br /><br />As far as the tea itself, it seems to have a very nice flavor and it gives you the stimulation in the morning without the jitters. It is a nice start to the day. A good alternative to strong coffee. Overall, I love this product and hope that Celestial Seasonings doesn't decide to discontinue since it doesn't seem to be a very well stocked item in most places. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: It's Just Curry To Us
review/text: We spent a few weeks in Morocco last year and bought ras el hanout in six different places--in Fez, Marrakesh, Rabat, and Meknes, at spice stands and supermarkets. The name means "head of the shop"--it's a blend of up to 100 spices and every place has a slightly different formula. With all six, we got a mild, aromatic, subtly perfumy seasoning with a tremendous depth of flavor. We love it on steamed lamb shanks. It has an outstanding affinity for whole roast chicken: brush melted butter all over the chicken, then coat generously with ras el hanout and a little salt and pepper. Roast at 365� for 1 hour and 45 minutes, turning it over after the first hour. Fabulous! Ras el hanout is about the same color as cumin. (See the article in Wikipedia for info on the main ingredients.)<br /><br />We were sorry to find out that this product is nothing like the real deal. We bought it because our Morocco stash is running out. It looks and tastes like ordinary curry powder, including a fair amount of hot chili pepper, not at all like ras el hanout. We threw it out. Don't waste your money.

review/text: The aroma of lemons is immediately apparent upon opening the cap and taking a whiff. Tasting it is even better. I also appreciate that the cap has a plastic insert that allows the oil to be poured in a more precise way, not coming out too fast.  Little things mean a lot sometimes.  I also researched brands of EVOO that do not have any other allergens, some do.  My toddler granddaughter is very allergic to dairy, eggs, and peanuts; and some of these oils use shared equipment with nuts.  Another oil I previously bought actually stated such on its label, I was shocked. I use oil as a butter substitute, so if an oil has anything but what I want and need in it, I must avoid it.  All in all, an oil I would buy again for taste and safety!

review/summary: It will spoil you!
review/text: A year ago I received some lemon-infused olive oil as a gift and just fell in love with it.  When it ran out, I looked for it on-line, but found it to be horribly expensive, so I searched for this on Amazon.  The quality is AT LEAST as good as the one that costs five times more!  It will give a subtle lift to dishes and I use it in a recipe for lemon muffins that people rave about.  Great service, fabulous product and a price that will make you happy!

review/summary: This I Really Like
review/text: I really like tacos and Spanish rice.  Problem is if I use the taco seasoning pack and rice seasoning pack, it ends being a gazillion mg of sodium.  The last time I bought a box of Spanish rice, I tossed the seasoning pack and added a couple of tablespoons of this instead.  It was just as good and the only salt came from the canned tomatoes.  Pretty good as taco meat seasoning, also.  I highly recommend it for anyone, especially those who love Tex-Mex and are watching the salt a bit.

review/summary: Too Sugary and Hard
review/text: I have not bought this brand from here, but I did buy it at an Asian store in Idaho. I love tamarind candy from Mexico so I tried this stuff. I think they are supposed to be some what soft tamarind paste balls but the ones I got were hard, had no flavor but sugar, and had large seeds. Maybe if these were fresher, they would be good. Maybe I'll buy from this seller someday.

review/summary: So Flavorful and Aromatic!
review/text: I bought this while away on a trip so that I could create a barbecue flavor without buying barbecue sauce.  It has been a great seasoning for chicken and coconut milk, rice and beans so far and it will definitely add a Jamaican-style flavor to your cooking.  I can't say if it tastes authentic or not, but it imparts a warm, hearty but not too spicy-hot flavor to foods.  Some people may want to add some hot sauce, cayenne pepper or crushed red pepper as well depending on personal preference. That being said, it does have a little "after kick" to it especially if you put a bit on your tongue and do a taste test. The ingredients are:  spices, salt, dehydrated onion and garlic, sugar, citric acid and canola oil as a processing aid.  Each 1/4 tsp. contains 105 mg of sodium and there are 157 servings in a 5 oz. container.  My only concern is that I am going to run out of this fairly quickly since I am enjoying it so much!

review/summary: excellent tea, blend with herbal tea for delicious midcaffeine tea
review/text: The chai mate has too much caffeine for me, as it is as much as a cup of coffee - although they claim it doesn't give you any jitters, for me it does. I blend this with one of their herbal (non-caffeine) chai's - the roobios is great - using a half-half ratio. The resultant mix is delicious with milk and a bit of honey - and is a great pick-me-up in mid morning. Teavana's teas also always make me feel better - each of their teas has a special "healing" power to it - I am not sure if it is true or not, but I do feel like I'm doing something better for my body by drinking their teas.

review/summary: Very nice chai with a unique flavor
review/text: Just got this tea in one of the IntoTeas gift sets and I'm loving it!  It's replaced my morning coffee and it much much healthier than the former with the same amount of caffeine.  Also, I have noticed that the caffeine "high" (for lack of a better word) is not as jittery as coffee but still gets the job done and gives me the energy I need in the morning.<br /><br />The taste is fantastic as well, and it's very unique.  I can't quite place all the flavors, other than of course the chai, but I'm very impressed.<br /><br />Here's to hoping the other Teavana teas I've got coming are just as good!

review/summary: Fantastical
review/text: I normally get this tea at Teavana stores in the mall or their website, so was excited to see it on Amazon (as I have tons of gift cards here). It seemed to take a little longer then other products to arrive but came in great shape and came with a free sample just like my other orders from the Teavana site have (which makes sense since they're partnered with Amazon). I drink the Samurai Chai Mate with the White Ayurvedic Chai  and they taste fantastic. They're supposed to be full of caffeine but for me they're my anytime tea. I have to steep a little longer then recommended time as I like my tea strong (with a bit of sugar or honey :) but it tastes great. Not to sickly sweet like some fruity teas.<br />It is sweeter then some of their other teas, so if you don't like sweet then you may want to try out some of their others. I recommend going into the stores and sampling their array of teas they usually have set out. The blend they normally have of this one is good but not always what comes out at home though so don't just go by that one, they use German rock sugar which costs a little more while most people will use normal table sugar, honey, or artificial sweetener which will affect the tastes. Anyway, go try the tea, find your tea, and drink happy :D

Delish.<br /><br />Note - we ordered a tea kettle (on Amazon :)) that allows you to brew to specific temps. I recently learned the temp coupled with the steeping time makes all the difference.<br /><br />One more thing -- Teavana has an app. It provides directions for preparing all the teas they sell, including combinations between varieties. AND it has a little timer for steeping.<br /><br />Good job Teavana.

Chilled them--opened a jar--and-well-where is the taste?  The olives were NOT tart enough--not enough vineagar maybe?  And they had a faint flavor, after I had tried a few, of cheese? Had an unusual aftertaste left in my mouth! So--they will be used but probably only in salads where there will be a dressing to add some flavor. Sorry--I was so looking forward to an amazing olive experience!

review/text: I bought this at a grocery store on sale and love the flavor. It is exactly what it sounds like it would be, sweet mint with a bit of a melon-y flavor. I've had people tell me my breath smelled really fantastic and ask what flavor of gum that was so they could get some. Everyone I give this to says it's a really unusual very tasty flavor. This stuff also really helps in terms of not snacking so much in the afternoons! It's sweet enough that I don't go reaching for a candy bar, but sugar free so I don't have to worry about cavities or calories. I LOVE this gum. If you're looking for something very fruity, this isn't for you. If you are looking for something with that cold bite that strong mints have, this also isn't for you. But if you like sweet mint flavors and also enjoy a little fruit with it, then this is your gum.

If you wish to try it, it's best to just buy ONE PACK before you invest in this multipack. Trident Layers: wild strawberry + tangy citrus is my favorite. Green/apple + golden/pineapple is good too. I purchased both of those in the multipack and was very happy. Good luck to you if you buy this flavor.

The brittle itself is somewhat opaque and absolutely fantastic.  I would order this stuff without the peanuts, just the brittle, if it was sold that way - it is that good.  It is somewhat less hard and at the same time actually more "brittle" than other peanut brittles.  Did I say that it is really fantastic?  I tell you, if I lived out West, I would be 20lbs heavier because of this stuff.

review/text: Just so you know, there are no peanuts in this mix.  You have the option to add any nut butter of your choice.  I'd been wanting "peanut butter" cookies for years since our allergies were diagnosed, but peanuts are not an option for us.  I made this mix using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HTIUDC">Sunbutter Natural Sunflower Seed Spread, 16-Ounce Plastic Jars (Pack of 6)</a> and it was EXACTLY like the peanut butter cookies my mom used to make (you know, the ones rolled in sugar and pressed with a fork).  I'm planning to make some more with dairy free chocolate- like the hershey's kiss ones- for Christmas.  The batch made with one bag was huge.  About double the amount you usually get from a cookie mix.  Anyway, I highly recommend this mix.  As a matter of fact, I haven't tried anything from the Cravings Place that didn't taste like the original gluten version I remember so go ahead and try whatever sounds good.  You won't be disappointed!

I have tried several different brands, (including organic) none of which pleased me. Not one to give up easily, based upon its description and reviews, I decided finally to try Tazo Organic Green Tea Bags.  What a delightful difference!  There is no comparison between Tazo Organic Green Tea Bags and the others I have tried! Every Tazo tea bag seems to say, "Scrupuously clean, scrupulously cared for!" It would have been to my advantage had I realized sooner that Tazo Organic Green Tea bags make wonderfully delicious green tea--- no strange after taste, no strange sensation in the tummy...simply so superior to the others I had tried! But then there are those times in life when you have to get to know what good is! Well,I have found the good which truly is "excellent plus" for green tea in this particular brand.<br />In my opinion Tazo organic green tea bags raises the bar and sets the standard for a great cup of green tea!

They are very dense and filling, I like the icing on them but unlike what someone else said in their review, I definitely taste a "chemical" aftertaste with these.  There's just something a bit "off" with the taste.  Just my two cents.  I got used to it after a while though and now I like them!
