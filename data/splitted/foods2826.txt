review/summary: Price jump on-line... can't find in stores,... what happened???
review/text: I love this drink! Tastes just like Yoohoo. Sadly, I saw the price jump and figured I should just buy it at my local Whole Foods...until I realized I can't find it there anymore either!! I don't know if it's being discontinued or what happened but I hope to find it again soon (and not for almost $60 a box).

review/text: I was so hesitant to try coconut water because so many of my friends have hated it. But I decided that I'd try the chocolate in hopes that it would be better. Wow! This stuff tastes just like a Yoohoo and has a similar consistency. Absolutely delicious. Had to come to Amazon to buy it in cases right away!

review/summary: Awesome!
review/text: My boyfriend and I both love coconut water and have been trying different brands for a while. We decided to stick with Zico but it doesn't contain extra sugar or other fruit juices like some of the other ones that we've tried. What I also like is the fact that I can subscribe for the product through amazon to get the case sent to me every month! This definitely takes the hassle out of going to the store to get it and I think it's set at a great price point. We've been going through our case so fast (we're pretty active) that I've increased my case count to 2 every month!

review/summary: Tastes oddly like watery skim milk...
review/text: I tried Zico in the plastic bottle, never in the tetra pack.<br /><br />Zico in the plastic bottle tastes like watery skim milk with a really really slight hint of coconut flavor. If you ever tried Taste Nirvana coconut water before, Zico pales in comparison. Zico is less sweet and saltier version of Taste Nirvana coconut water. I've also tried VitaCoco. Compared to VitaCoco, Zico tastes creamier than VitaCoco and doesn't have that sour taste.<br /><br />However, in all honesty, Zico tastes like skim milk and nothing like real coconut water from a fresh coconut.

review/summary: Prefer the original flavor because the Mango tastes fake
review/text: I've always enjoyed the original Zico coconut water, but thought I'd give some of the other flavors a try. The mango flavor really jumped out at me because I love mangoes and thought coconut and mangoes would perfectly compliment each other. Unfortunately, the Zico drinks with "natural mango flavor" taste like someone dropped a mango flavored hard candy into my Zico drink. It's not terrible, but that's definitely NOT the refreshing flavor I was hoping for, especially after a hard workout! I think I can manage to power through the remaining 11 drink boxes I bought, but I won't be wasting my money on this drink again.

review/summary: Perfect drink while pregnant
review/text: This is a wonderful beverage to enjoy daily while pregnant!  I am 6 months preg and started feeling dizzy/lightheaded.  OB said to drink more liquids but I still have morning sickness and liquids before 10 AM dont stay down.  I tried several different coconut waters and found this Zico chocolate, ONE with guava and Naked plain to be the three I prefer.  This Zico chocolate is my favorite!  It is good in the morning when milk is too heavy and fruit juice is unappealing.  I feel much better after a couple of weeks drinking 1-2 coconut waters a day in addition to as much regular water I can stomach.  It is an expensive habit, but prescription anti nausea pills or going to the ER from dehydration is more expensive.

review/summary: Perfect
review/text: I received my case of Zico Coconut Water within the two days advertised by "Amazon Prime".  It was interesting to me that, what with the free shipping, this was more than a dollar a bottle cheaper than I buy it for in the grocery store.  It came double boxed.  That is, there was a compartmentalized container with the liter bottles carefully packed within, this box was surrounded by air bag packaging and packed within a larger sturdy cardboard container.  Great packaging.<br />  My wife uses this product and her comments follow:  As to the taste.  I found I prefer Zico over the other brands as it doesn't appear to have any "hidden" sugar added to hype up the taste.  My previous brand, Vita Coco,  did not declare added sugar, but it did leave that sugared drink after taste in my mouth and was noticeably sweeter.<br />  I cannot say that I particularly like the taste of coconut water, but it has the nutritional potassium I need in my diet, and is easier to keep around than bananas and has less calories.

review/text: This is the first time I have tried this product.  I have never had the original formula so I can't compare it to what was a highly rated product.  At first the taste is somewhat pleasant but not very natural tasting and then there is a lingering aftertaste.  I will not buy this again and do not recommend it.  I want to try other brands. I think I will enjoy it because coconut water is not very sweet, low calorie and high in potassium.

review/summary: Love this!!!
review/text: Great new product, I have tried all 4 flavors... TROPICAL CITRUS; FRUIT PUNCH; ACAI, GRAPE POMEGRANATE and Energy PEACH GREEN TEA. I work in a high school and I am always getting sick. I have been drinking Vitamin Squeeze for several months now and HAVE NOT BEEN SICK ONCE...this is the only thing I have done differently! I don't like the taste of the tap water at the school, so this product is ideal for changing the tap water into a drink that is delicious and motivates me to drink more water. Finally, a truly great drink, which is much better than MIO and half the price of Vitaminwater! All it takes is a "little" squeeze for me. Vitamin Squeeze does not leave an aftertaste like some 0 calorie products. 0 calorie, 0 carbs, 0 sugar! Love it! My teens think the Tropical Citrus tastes like Tang or a Creamsicle. I am headed back to Safeway to get more! I highly recommend this product!

review/text: My boyfriend and I got a pack of this gum at the store a few weeks ago, and we were both so excited because we remembered it from when we were younger. I would have thought it was just time, or my imagination playing tricks on me, but he agreed, the gum tasted chemically and had a terrible consistency. We both spit it out after a few chews. I don't know if they changed something in the mix, or if it's just indicative of the low quality and corner cutting society we now live in, but I would definitely not recommend this gum...nostalgia factor is fun, but the flavor is not!

review/summary: Crammed full of Sugar - 29g per can!
review/text: I spent days trying to find decent coconut water/juice in order to make shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every coconut water product I looked at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. An amazing 29 grams of sugar per can. Also, this product is only 70% juice! What's the other 30 percent? An average can of soda contains 30 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened coconut water, but I can't find it. Why in the world do manufactures feel the need to sweeten things that are already fine and sweet? Alright, maybe a little sugar, but 29grams? I'm drinking this because I care about my health and don't want to drink soda! Leave it to them to take something perfect the way it is, and make it just as bad as soda! Don't wonder why they don't post this nutritional information on the product page; they don't want you to know it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet product! There IS a market for unsweetened coconut water, guys.

I also keep the original flavors, so I can have a big variety of suckers.  I do wish the price was a little lower - not everyone contributes to the *candy fund* piggy bank (which is really optional, as I enjoy providing the candy), but it would be nice if Tootsie Roll wouldn't charge quite so much for these suckers.

It is not as acidic as Orange Juice so you won't have to worry about reflux... therefore, it is great as a late night drink when you don't want to drink something with caffeine or fizz.

review/text: This stuff is better than pixie dust!  I was trying to get off raw sugar, so I tried Splenda.  It was a no- i'm not into chemicals such as Sucralose or other chemical additive sweeteners.  When I came across Stevia I was optimistic because it is all natural.  Your first taste of it /might/ be one of a diet taste - but fear not!  It is very sweet, does not have an aftertaste and I got used to it right away.  Now I like sweet coffee and tea.  I actually was putting 3 teaspons of sugar in a cup of coffee and was obviously having a hard time maintaining my weight.  Simply Stevia did-the-trick!  I -LOVE- this sweetner!  I now crave coffee and tea much more than I ever did and I enjoy it so much more.  Really, everyone should switch to Stevia.  You can also buy Stevia (not simply stevia unfortunately) at you local health food store.  I choose the "sweetleaf" Stevia Extract, but it can be more difficult to dissolve in liquid, but it works just the same.  The only problem I have encountered with "simply steavia" is how to buy larger quantities!  I will be using Stevia from now on.

review/summary: Super Sweet Stuff
review/text: Simply Stevia is super sweet!  A tiny bit is all you need to sweeten your stuff.  I like to mix 1/4 teaspoon Simply Stevia with 1/2 cup of sugar in Kool-Aid for a less sugary drink for my kids.  I'm still trying to learn how to bake with it though.  It does not directly replace sugar in baking because the texture of the finished product changes.  I have tried several brands of stevia and this one has a good taste.  My favorite brand of stevia for flavor, however, is Stevita brand packets. You can buy that on Amazon, too, at a terrific price.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QV8HMQ">Stevia Supreme - 50 pack</a>

review/summary: Simply Stevia
review/text: First time we have tried stevia so I have no other brands to compare to.  Stevia has a different taste than sugar so you have to get used to that.  In baking with it it did not seem that sweet but I am learning that you have to make your own adjustments.  I love being able to make wholesome cookies & muffins for my children without sugar so I am willing to learn how to use stevia.

review/summary: extremely bitter
review/text: Buyer beware! This powder is very bitter. And no, it's not the amount that I used. I started with a pinch because I read the serving size and recommendation from others before I used it. On top of that, I don't have a sweet tooth. I drink black coffee. This is like chewing a vitamin or any other pill that you're supposed to swallow, or like drinking a hard liquor shot but savoring it slowing instead of just swallowing it quickly. I was so traumatized by the bad taste that I decided to try it a second time before I dumped the whole container in my trash (good thing I bought this with a gift card, so I don't feel too bad about wasting my money). I am disappointed with stevia as a sweetener because this is version is supposed to be less bitter because of its pureness. What's the point of using all the other stevia products coming out with other ingredients added, if the sweetness or better flavor is coming from those other ingredients? It's just a new marketing gimmick to attach the stevia name to other sweeteners.

review/summary: A Hidden Treasure That Needs To be Mentioned
review/text: I discovered these noodles about 10 years ago.  Somebody  told me about them.  He warned me they would be spicy.  Hot? That is putting it mildly.  By adding several ingredients which I discovered through trial and error, I have been able to formulate the perfect soup.  Even with all the ingredients I add, this soup only takes about 5 minutes to prepare. This soup mix is mostly Cayenne pepper which is really good for you.  I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned this is good for a cold.  It really cleans out your nasal passages.  The only downside is the soup mix contains MSG.  I have given these noodles to friends. One friend hated them, the other friend is addicted.  You either love them or hate them.  I love them!

review/text: These taste really great. They are a much higher noodle quality than other ramen noodles that I am used to. A Korean friend of mine told me about them. She said that her parents serve them in their restaurant. The seasoning packet can get a little hot, so I usually don't use the whole thing. It also comes with a vegetable packet, so you get some mushrooms and whatnot. I like them enough that I was willing to order them online and pay for (and wait for) shipping, until I found a local place that sells this brand, if that tells you anything about the quality difference.

review/text: Since the dog food recall scare, I've been extremely cautious with the dog food that I buy. I did my research and I was very happy with the ingredients in Azmira. My dog took a little while to warm up to it, but now he just loves the food! I love the fact that it's holistic food and very good for him and even his stool looks so much healthier. I gave him the option of eating two different kinds of food, Eukanuba and Azmira. He prefers the Azmira so much more! I have recently switched to it 100% since the transition is done and I'm very satisfied with the results. Great dog food!

review/text: I first encountered this candy as part of a sample pack when I purchased bulk coffee candy.  This tea candy is different from other hard candies--a pleasant surprise.  It tastes very much like sweetened iced tea, but not too sweet, it has just the right amount of cane sugar to give it a very natural tasting sweetness.  This is not your typical sugared candy, you know typical supermarket candies that overwhelm you with a rush of sugar.  This tea candy is very mild in sweetness compared to other candies.  I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Worth the Price but hard to find!
review/text: My cat gets a combination of wet food in the morning and dry in the evening (sometimes dry in with the wet in the morning if we don't have his normal wet food). I don't know that I would call him a picky eater but I do know that since I put him on this dry food minimal hairballs, his weight has come down (he was at 15lb now down to 11), his coat is beautiful, and the vet says he is super healthy. I did go with a cheaper, easier to find dry food when we ran out of this once before and never again! His coat got duller and hairballs galore! Now the biggest problem is actually finding this brand and specific type for him. Because he doesn't get tons of this, a 7lb bag will last at least 2 months so I don't get the bigger bag, but if you try it and only feed dry food, I would go with a larger size bag. All in all, we love it!

review/text: These taste excellent straight out of the can on gluten free crackers.  Excellent source of protein, too!  I purchased several types of this brand at the store to sample them before I purchased them in bulk on Amazon - glad I did!  This one is my favorite.  Firm fish and great combination of smoked flavor with cracked pepper.  Mine wasn't in pieces as another reviewer stated.

Lee Kum Kee is one of the best hoisin sauces on the market. It's authentic, and it's splendid in stir fries--and noodles of course! While hoisin sauce is complicated to make, this premade sauce is excellent. It's East meets West!

review/summary: Truly, one of the best tasting jerkys...
review/text: What can I say about Oberto BBQ Pork Natural Style Jerky?<br /><br />Simply delicious...<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />(But if you'd like more information....)<br /><br />I am spoiled by my grandmother who made homemade jerkys when I was a kid. She did it the old fashioned way, she seasoned and flavored them and then she used the combination of the sun and slow heat (through her homemade clay oven) to create jerkys that were out of this world.<br /><br />Since her death(many years ago), I have been looking for a jerky that might come close but more often than not, I would be highly disappointed.<br /><br />When I found Oberto's BBQ Pork jerky at a Costco, I was skeptical. But after the first bite, I was hooked. It comes extremely close...<br /><br />TENDERNESS...this jerky is tender. Not slimy or gushy kind of tender, but one that you can sink your teeth into easily yet, have enough of a texture to "sponge" back to make it tasty. It is NOT chewy like you would a regular jerky, but as you chew it, it does "melt" in your mouth.<br />It reminds me of eating "filet-mignon" yet more flavorful.<br /><br />Pork jerkys are more flavorful than beef jerkys and this pork jerky is definitely flavorful.<br /><br />The spices that are used to cure and make this jerky seem to be just right. Hint of smokiness yet not over whelming. The spices blend well in your mouth while the jerky melts.<br /><br />Truly enjoyable jerky...<br /><br />As for nutritional value, it is very very lean meat. So it IS high in protein.<br /><br />But bare in mind that ALL cured meat are going to be considered: Dangerous and NON-healthy<br /><br />but if you just have to eat some cured meat, if you LOVE jerkys, if you just gotta have a jerky sometimes because you are tired of eating "healthy" food all the time.<br /><br />I would highly recommend Oberto BBQ Pork Jerky more than any other jerky that's out there on the market.

review/text: This BBQ pork jerky by Oberto is simply incredible! We can't keep it in the house for over a day. Our doggy will cast aside her Beggin' Strips in preference and protest...she gets really serious about her snacks. The pork slices have a scrumptious sweet and hot barbeque flavor, and they're not as tough as beef jerky. My only 'beef' with the pork is a common one...NOT ENOUGH THERE. This stuff comes in at about a buck and a half an ounce...approximately twenty-four bucks per pound. C'mon jerky makers, cut us some slack [and a bit more meat, if ya please]!

review/summary: Not Every Day Oberto
review/text: Oberto is all over the place at your standard discount stores and grocery stores.  You can't walk through a Wally World or Target without seeing it.  However, this is NOT the stuff in those stores.  This jerky is made from premium pork with minimal processing and no artificial ingredients added.  In addition it is 91% fat free and contains no MSG.  You would be hard pressed to find most of those descriptors on almost every other brand of meat jerky out there.  Even other Oberto jerky products do not meet this high standard of quality.<br /><br />The jerky itself is moist, tender and delicious and extremely difficult to put down.  I decided to purchase this jerky after checking out a blog/jerky tester site on the internet.  This was one of their highly recommended ones and one of the few they recommended that is a mainstream brand.<br /><br />Try it, it is different than what you might expect.

review/summary: 11 Flavors!!
review/text: So I wasn't convinced about the greatness of Popchips - until I tried them!!  Now, although they are more expensive than regular chips, they are so much healthier and taste GREAT so I'm not sure I will ever buy regular chips again!<br /><br />However, even though I loved the basic flavors in the 6-flavor variety I wanted to try some of the different varieties because they sounded good.  The only purchase option to try some of these other flavors was to buy a whole box, and I was very skeptical to buy an entire box of 24 if I didn't like the flavor.  This variety pack gave me the perfect opportunity to sample each flavor to determine my favorites!  I wondered what flavors I would be getting since they were not listed in the description, so in case it matters to you:<br />  - Thai Sweet Chili (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Parmesan Garlic (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Jalapeno (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Cheddar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sweet Potato (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sea Salt & Vinegar (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Salt & Pepper (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Chili Limi (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Sour Cream & Onion (2 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Barbeque (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />  - Original (3 .8 ounce bags)<br />I haven't had a chance to sample all of the flavors yet, but the ones I have tried are wonderful.  They taste healthy (although they aren't exactly healthy - they are the better alternative) very crunchy and full of flavor.  The only flavor I don't really care for is the Original, and that's because it is pretty salty.<br />Don't be skeptical - try this variety pack and find your favorite flavor!

I also don't think they taste like a diet food-they very tasty.  I had only tried the BBQ flavor previously, and then ordered this variety pack.  I've never been big on plain chips, and as the other reviewer said, those are probably my least favorite.  The price is higher than purchasing regular chips at a store, but that wasn't a concerning factor for me.  I will probably purchase again, when these are gone.

review/text: Being new to Popchips, never even heard of Popchips until I saw the gold box deal of the day, even with the deal of the day, the packs seemed expensive - 24 pack for $12.99 with free Amazon Prime shipping, and the bags are only 0.8oz each, I can't imagine how they're $20.50 for a box of 24 when it was on sale for still $12.99... expensive chips, but I got them recently, and it's as advertised - they're healthy, they don't taste as good as the fried ones but you have to sacrifice some flavor for healthy chips, they still have good & tasty flavor just not as much as fried, but I knew that already before purchasing it.<br /><br />I admit, I was a bit scared that I wouldn't like the chips and buying a box of 24 packs at once seeing as I've never had them until now was a risk purchase, but it's a sampler so I knew that there had to be at least one flavor that I'll like out of 11 flavors. So far I've tried salt & pepper which is gross in my opinion and the original popchips. Original popchips I like, tasted like original chips like pringles original except these are way more healthier since they're popped.

I had never venued onto Amazon to buy food before but I am so glad I did.<br /><br />This is a great way to try out all the flavors to figure out what you like, and also if you have someone else working with you on weight loss, you can both try them.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this product and how strong the flavors are.<br /><br />I will defintely be buying again.

review/summary: Pop chips
review/text: I must say these are not that tasty. They may be healthier than potato chips but the taste is lacking for me. Yes they are low calorie and lower salt. My favorite flavor was barbeque, that did taste somewhat like chips. I probably will not order again, but it was a nice way to try the different flavores.
