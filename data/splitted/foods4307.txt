review/summary: Addictive - beware of sugar.
review/text: Funny how this product seems so polarizing.  I dislike Fig Newtons but love these bars' true-fruit sweetness and gooey density.  Some bars do stick together. The filling is by no means hard to chew or gigantic, though, as some reviewers have oddly implied.  If freshness was ever a problem, it may have been corrected: the shipment I got was several months before the expiration date.<br /><br />My only qualm: though naturally sweetened, each piece contains 8g sugar. The serving size of 2 bars is more filling than you'd expect, but if eaten as a quick breakfast or even lasting snack you'd need at least 4 -- for 32g sugar.  "Natural" or not that's too much sugar.

review/summary: can't keep them in the house!
review/text: These are so good.  My kids have eaten them since they were very young and now they are 12, 15 and 17 and still love them!  My 80 year old mom loves them and raids the jar every time she visits finishing them off!  My husband likes them and he hates healthy food, haha!  They are yummy berry flavor and the cake part is very moist.  Just enough to hit the sweet craving without blowing tons of calories and fat.  And no wheat!!  Yummy, yummy. I take them out of their pack and put them  in a glass jar as soon as they are opened.  Now I buy them by the case on Amazon since the groceries around us charge about $5-$6 a pack!

They don't crumble when dunked (and believe me, we are dunkers). They make a great 'on the go' breakfast cookie when you are rushed in the morning. What mom doesn't love that?!?<br /><br />We have ordered several shipments of these from amazon. Always fresh and always fast. Best price. They run TWICE the price at the local 'natural' grocery chain.

review/summary: Delicious Raspberry fig bars!
review/text: First, I second the comments of some who have noted shipping issues.  My shipment came with the cookies very tightly packed in a single box that was of less than sturdy construction leading to some crushed packages. Luckily, few bars/cookies were affected, but that was a big surprise as the box corners had caved in.  But putting that aside...<br /><br />These cookies were very tasty.  The Raspberry fig filling is delicious.  Lots of good raspberry flavor.  The thick "cookie" wrapper has a distinct grain (barley) flavor.  A new flavor to me, but I got used to it.  Overall, though, simply delicious.  I love figs, fig bars, and raspberries so a taste treat for me.<br /><br />I purchased via "Subscribe & Save" for the best price.  My biggest problem now is not eating too many of these as they are fairly high in calories (120 cals/2 bars).  But they are good, healthy calories! ;)

review/summary: Tasty little treats but not organic
review/text: If these little cookies were organic they would get 5 stars plus, but alas they are not.  They are extra sweet with only 60 calories per bar, mostly from concentrated fruit juices.  They do have a definite raspberry taste and I'm a sucker for "anything raspberry"!<br /><br />We are not gluten sensitive but do not eat wheat. I bought them because they contain no wheat or refined sugar and the price on Amazon is very good.  I just wish Barbara's bakery would change to organic ingredients because they make such tasty treats.<br /><br />All that said, two bars and a nice big glass of soy or almond milk make for a satisfied evening tummy! (They're good with coffee or tea too.)

review/summary: Good, but you have to like whole grain. Freeze well.
review/text: These fig bars are big step up over the typical supermarket brands, but you do have to like a strong whole-grain taste and the lack of additives makes them a bit dry. They freeze well so it works ok to buy the six pack. They actually make a nice cold sweet if you eat them frozen, but they do hold their texture once thawed too.

review/text: So, this is the thing: these bars are wheat-free and they taste ***good.*** But who cares about the whole wheat-free thing? I'll tell you who, folks who are wheat intolerant or allergic! So, it's all well and fine that this company is touting them as wheat free but they're made with oats as well as barley (gluten ingredients) so that's a big turn off. I don't get it. This product suggests that it is intended for a specialized market but it's made of ingredients that would prohibit purchasing it. Illogical. I wish Barbara's would make this product w/o the gluten so that I could buy it for my family! Meh!

review/summary: We love them, but not for everyone
review/text: Okay, we try as hard as we can to eat as little sugar and as little white flour as we can, but it is hard, one still needs sweets and snacks, especially with kids.  These are great, 100% whole wheat, and sweetened with fruit juice instead of a more refined sugar.  This may make me a bad mom, but on mornings when we are running late and I know we don't have time for a good and normal breakfast, I will give the girls one of these with milk, they're getting fruit and whole grain, so...  I say they are not for everyone because if you are used to Fig Newtons you will probably not like these, if you are not used to eating products for their whole grain content and lack of refined sugars, you probably won't like these.  I used to love Fig Newtons, but in a effort to be more healthy I gave them up and now only eat these, it has been long enough now that we have been eating healthier that I like the taste of these.  The girls knew no better, they had never had a real Fig Newton so had nothing to compare to and they just eat these up.  I don't know that we could go through a case of 6, we just buy one package at a time at our local Coborn's, and we don't go through them that fast as they are a treat not a daily thing or anything, so....

review/text: Received our first case of Barbara's Blueberry Fig Bars a couple of days before Christmas. Once our guestssssss were awake and stirring, each had their choice of coffees or teas and I offered the fig bars as an accompaniment as I worked on getting breakfast prepared and on the table. Everyone loved the bars, even ME who is not typically a lover of blueberry flavored foods.  I had guests who hate FIG NEWTONS, but loved these. The first package was gone in a flash and I will open another tomorrow morning to buy me some time in the kitchen with breakfast prep once again.  I anticipate that after the Holidays, these will be a new addition to my IN THE CAR, morning COMMUTE, easy to eat breakfast items to have as I sip coffee along the route to work.

review/summary: Misleading product name
review/text: This product may indeed be delicious but the product name is at the very least misleading, at worst deceptive. Anyone with celiac disease or other wheat intolerance needs to know that this product, though free of wheat, is made with multiple grains, including barley flour, and so is unsuitable for their use. Rightfully, the product should be named Multigrain Fig Bars as that is what they are. I don't see why anyone would specifically choose a wheat-free product over one containing wheat unless one is wheat intolerant (and therefore intolerant to all wheat-related grains). What possible legitimate reason could there be then to name this product "Wheat Free"? My rating of the product is based not on the product per se but on the unfortunate and misleading name Barbara's Bakery has chosen to give it. Please note also that a representative of Barbara's Bakery in a private communication to me in response to my objection to the name of this product stated there was no claim made that the product was gluten free then added that the few products Barbara's Bakery makes which it does claim to be gluten free are made in non-dedicated facilities which also process wheat. This is absurd as those products are subject to contamination with wheat and cannot legitimately be considered gluten free. It all comes down to a matter of truth in advertising. Where there is no truth in advertising what trust can there be in any of the products the company produces?

review/summary: A gift that keeps giving
review/text: I got one of these plants as a Christmas present and it is doing great. It looked slightly wilted when it arrived but perked right up with some light and water. I nearly killed it once by forgetting to water it for a week and it made a comeback and has never looked better. It now has over 10 new branches and looks very healthy and happy. I would recommend this drought tolerant plant to anyone who is looking for something that is easy to care for.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love this product! I work really early and I never have time to make breakfast. I have a hard time finding breakfast food that's quick, healthy and tastes good. I think oatmeal is a great option, but the old fashioned oats can be very bland. Most of the other flavored instant packets are too sugary. So I was very happy to find this product. The oatmeal was delicious - flavorful but not TOO sweet.  I'm anxious to try the other flavors.

review/text: This flavor of instant oatmeal really hits the sweet spot. It's just the right balance between soft and chewy, just the right touch of maple sweetness, and no aftertaste. I love it! The instructions are easy, you can measure the water right in the pouch. The only caveat I would add here is that if you use a high watt microwave oven, two minutes could make your hot cereal explode. Other than that, this is the perfect quick breakfast.

review/summary: One rule in our home - we DON'T run out of this coffee!
review/text: I am not a fan of "flavored" coffees. I don't use sugar. I don't use the "flavored" faux-cream products that crowd supermarket coffee aisles these days. I like real coffee with perhaps just a touch of real cream in the first cup followed by successive dilution with hot coffee top-offs (no more cream). I am not a coffee "snob" but I don't believe all coffee is the same, I like to taste my coffee - not the extras (thank you very much), and I don't mind paying more for top grade coffee. So how in the world did I wind up with this coffee in my cup??<br /><br />Well, my wife is not a coffee purist. She likes her coffee sweet with flavored liquid creamer "products". How the heck can people taste the coffee with that mess in their cup?? And if you need that junk with your coffee, for goodness sake please don't waste a premium coffee! Right? I mean seriously, what's the point?<br /><br />Anyway, rather than dealing with two different coffees every morning or watching a good coffee get beat up with the overpowering sweet creamer "product" (have you ever read the ingredients?), instead I went on the hunt for a real coffee with good taste, full aroma and some mutually agreeable "flavor" already in the bean that wouldn't hide the coffee but would still appeal to my wife. Well, we both love pecans so when I read reviews for Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan whole bean coffee I decided we had to give it a shot.<br /><br />The next morning after we put our first bag in the pantry, I opened it up - getting first full shot of the rich roast aroma of the whole beans (wow!) - ground the beans, brewed that first pot then put a steaming cup in front of my wife with real cream - no sugar - and asked her to just give it a try.  With that very first cup, we both agreed this would be a new "staple" in our pantry and soon added it to our existing (Amazon) subscription purchases to insure we don't ever run out. This has become our preferred weekend coffee (we like to relax on weekend mornings and enjoy extra cup or two of coffee we can "linger over") and occasionally it manages to "sneak" into the weekday coffee rotation when we have a slower morning available.<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong, I still enjoy great top grade coffees and will never give them up. And my wife will continue to prefer her coffee "creamed & sweetened". But, at least for this particular coffee, I have learned that "flavored" and "real coffee" don't have to be mutually exclusive (when sourced, blended and roasted correctly). And my wife has learned that sometimes coffee (well, this one anyway!) can be better appreciated with a simple splash of real cream - no flavored sweet creamer "products" allowed with this coffee.<br /><br />As for the price, well again that's not my primary criteria with food and beverages - taste and quality are higher priorities for me. But I can appreciate a bargain, and I fully agree that when you can find a good product at a great price, that makes it even better (hence, five stars on this review). Seriously, there is no doubt this is a good coffee at a great price. So, whether you approach your purchasing decision from a taste or value bias, go ahead and put a bag in your cart, get this coffee in your cup and prepare to become a fan.

review/summary: This coffee hits the spot!
review/text: I'm not the biggest fan of flavored coffees, but i had to try this after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Typically for me, flavored coffee smells great out of the bag, and smells like the flavor when you are brewing it, but once you taste it you find the flavor is gone, and worst is that the underlying coffee really isn't that great.  This is totally the opposite.<br /><br />I brew a batch in the coffee machine, and when I take a sip the first thing I taste is a smooth medium roast which is actually more than decent.  I didn't really pick up the hint of sweetness the pecan was giving off until my 3rd or 4th sip.  Very subtle at first, but more noticeable once you know it's there.  Definitely not overpowering, but just enough where you might think twice about adding sweetener to it.  I tried it in the french press, and man!  it's twice as good.  Really brings out the richness and pecan flavor!<br /><br />This coffee smells so good out of the bag you almost want to eat the beans by themselves.  And again, the best part is that the way it smells when you brew it is exactly how it tastes.  It's nothing but a good smooth cup of coffee.  Can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Best flavored coffee we've had
review/text: I tried 8 different roasts from the roaster when they had a product demo at our local Costco just before Christmas. Looking for a mild roast coffee and like this the best. It's flavoring is not as overwhelming as Millstone's flavored coffee from the supermarket bulk coffee bins, and the coffee has more taste. We grind our coffee daily and prefer french-press coffee when the weather is warm enough, because brewing often brings out the bitterness in the beans. We drink our coffee with a small amount of either milk, soy-milk or almond milk, no sugar or sweetener, and we taste no bitterness from this roast at all. My wife and I finished the 2-pound bag in less than a month. Just bought a bi-monthly subscription from Amazon for a more reliable supply than Costco.<br /><br />It's about 4 months after we bought our first bag of this coffee at Costco and are on the second bag from our subscription. Glad we bought the subscription at $12.50 each shipment, but I noticed some difference between the coffee we get through our Amazon subscription. The bag we bought from Costco consists of larger beans typical for premium coffee, with an oily sheen on the beans. While the coffee beans from our subscription also has the oily sheen, the beans are noticeability smaller, as we can compare from another bag of premium coffee we bought from Costco. Has anyone noticed this? It's a little disappointing!<br /><br />Since Costco stopped stocking this brand of coffee after the first batch from the product demo ran out, we can't compare the beans we got from the product demo and what we get through our Amazon subscription, but the coffee from the subscription does taste weak, so I'll try a bag of the French Bean flavor and mix it as some reviews are doing.

review/summary: Much ado about coffee...
review/text: I just started drinking coffee. I like medium strength flavored coffees.  I drink mine with creme and sugar.  The first cup I made I used a semi coarse grind in my auto drip maker and the coffee was a little weak.  For the second cup, I ground the beans fine and it was absolutely perfect (and there was no sediment in the bottom of the pot).  Not too strong or bitter and packed full of flavor.  I highly suggest this coffee.  The beans were nice and shiny and very fresh.  I only drink one cup a day so this will last forever.  This coffee also smells amazing and makes my house more inviting.  Coffee is complex.  There is a lot of good info out there so read up and educate yourself. Make sure you are using fresh water, and the right kind of coffee maker with the correct grind, filter, etc.  Knowledge is power.  Hope this was helpful.<br /><br />One thing I was a little confused on was the price here.  It said this coffee was discounted from $16.00, yet when I went to Cameron's website, they sell this coffee directly from them for $13.99 for the same product so i'm perplexed as to the price increase???

review/text: I love this coffee. I've been drinking Eight O'Clock for years until I tried Cameron's Southern Pecan, which is much better. It has a definite nutty flavor, the pecan flavor itself more subtle, but definitely detectable. A little chocolaty flavor adds to it to make a rich but not bitter taste if brewed right. I find that 2 level tablespoons to 6 oz. of water is about right, but I make mine slightly stronger. Anything less than 2 tablespoons to 6 oz. and it'll taste like average store-bought. It's just got a wonderful warm flavor. I just make enough for 2 cups in the morning, grinding enough beans for 3 days so it doesn't lose flavor. Great stuff!

When we brewed the first cup, we were so disappointed. It tasted like weak, watered down coffee. We even tried to add a few more scoops of the grinds to concentrate the coffee, but it didn't work. The thing is I am not even a coffee snob. Overall, I am so diasppointed with this purchase.

review/summary: Not to my taste
review/text: I read favorable reviews on this coffee so I ordered it. My wife took one taste and said she wood not drink it. The package says it contains "coffee beans and artificial and other flavors". I thought it smelled like pecans, but I found no characteristic flavor other than supermarket coffee.<br /><br />I am not returning this because I drink my mistakes.<br /><br />Derryl Millican

review/summary: Fake Tasting!!!
review/text: This coffee has way to strong of a smell and doesn't taste like Southern Pecan Roast at all. I am not a flavored coffee drinker but the pecan roasts at coffee shops that I've had are really good, this stuff just has way to much flavor/smell. Honestly this coffee tastes more like a hazelnut or something like that. I would not suggest getting this coffee if you're like me and don't drink flavored coffee but want a lightly flavored pecan roast. Now I've got tons of coffee I could care less to drink.

review/summary: Solid, not spectacular
review/text: In lieu of the nearly mythical regard of this coffee according to our Amazon reviewers, I simply had to give this a go. Initial results are: good, but not as good as advertised. Allow me to elaborate: I LOVE COFFEE. This stuff does not taste like coffee, it tastes like flavored water. It lacks that fullness and bold flavor that I desire, which I guess is what you're getting when you get pecan flavored coffee.<br /><br />TL;DR: If you like bold coffee, avoid at all costs. If you like "light" coffee, this is your blend. Either way, you'll like it, just maybe not as much as everyone implies.

review/text: First of all, I'm a Dunkin Donut coffee fan (French Vanilla). I've been a regular Dunkin Donut coffee drinker for over 45 years. I enjoy a mild aromatic brew, versus the Starbuck/ Pete's/ Seattle type sharp burnt flavor. I've been looking for a coffee bean comparable to my taste, and I've found it. I grind my beans just before brewing, and this Cameron's Toasted Southern Pecan Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag fits the bill. This coffee exceeds my expectations!! Give it a try.

review/summary: it has too much flavor added - too sweet and smelly - dont get it
review/text: i bought several of these two pound bags so i can take them with me overseas because of the generally very good reviews, in spite of the few very negative reviews - one i remember reading sticks in my mind now "it tastes like pecan and water" - i had that same experience with the first cup that i made, but by making it really strong (lots of beans, ground really fine) it was better.  but still, overall, it is not that great. not horrible so i throw it all out, but i will not buy it again.<br /><br />it smells too sweet, too strong - i think they WAY overdo it on the pecan flavoring because as soon as i open the fridge i can smell the coffee its kind of nauseating.<br /><br />my mom described it best i think - it tastes like those flavored coffees you find at gas stations.

review/text: This was the first time I tried organic whole bean coffee.  I bought this brand based on the rave reviews and boy does everyone have it right.  This coffee is so awesome!  At such a reasonable price as well.  You open the bag for the first time and the rich coffee smell that comes out of the bag is incredible.  It was so good, I bought a bag for my friend who is a coffee conneseur and a Starbuck freak and he said that it was really good.  I have a couple of cans of Supermarket stuff that I have to finish.  It was fine before, but now it tastes like burnt ash compared to the smooth fragrant Cameron brand.

review/summary: Too weak for me
review/text: I tried this coffee since I've really been enjoying the other Cameron coffees and this one had many good reviews. I found it way too weak for my taste. I grind my beans fresh and use 8 scoops of beans for 12 cups of coffee which works out just perfect with the Cameron French Roast and Water and Woods, but the Pecan just came out way too weak. I also thought the pecan flavor was too overwhelming. I'm not a big fan of flavored coffees to begin with, but the reviews swayed me. I'll stick to the pure stuff from now on. If you are into a strong cup of coffee in the morning, this is not the one for you.

review/summary: This was at least 88% cheaper per ounce
review/text: Price:<br />For those who shop by Unit price like me for the real deal, this was the cheapest I can find this seasoning anywhere. Bj,s did not have this flavor. The container size is 24 ounce. The average size seasoning for the normal size in the supermarkets was 4 ounces. The 4 ounce size was $9.99. The unit prices are normally in pounds or LBS at the markets. Lets do the math. Here on Amazon for the 24 OZ size its $17.00 So the supermarket is selling this for $2.49 per oz or $39.84 per Lb. On amazon your paying $1.41 per oz or $22.56 per LB. What that means is your saving $1.08 per oz or $17.28 per lb in the UNIT price. Unit price is important. Its what you pay per cup, per quart per oz or pound, or per 100sheet of tissue and paper towel. Its how you determine what really is the deal. So that being said, store price is 176% more at the unit price level. So even if it was buy one get one free at the markets or half off, your still paying more than getting it from Amazon.<br /><br />Flavor:<br />This has a Texas style BBQ grilled flavor to it. That's the taste I love, and a use it to BBQ and for my seasoning with ribs and salmon. I love the taste. Go for it, Its a unique BBQ type seasoning. And the size it will last a long time in the house.

review/summary: Prowl Cat Food - How to Introduce It To Your Cat for the First Time
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 4:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>VIDEO REVIEW:<br /><br />In the video, I show how I mix up Prowl, what it looks like, plus my three cats are shown eating it.<br /><br />Her Highness Serena, Oliver the Tabby Kitten and my Siamese the Wonder Kitty say, "Purrlease enjoy the video!" :) My kitten Oliver gets a small amount of Prowl because he is on another food currently and will be transitioning to Prowl shortly. Enjoy the video! :)<br /><br />My (written) review: ;)<br /><br />Basically, this is to help anyone introducing Prowl to your cats for the first time. Once your kitties get used to Prowl, you can mix it up to different consistencies. :)<br /><br />I received a sample in the mail from Prowl before purchasing my first box of Prowl. This sample turned out to be very helpful, as the sample was for making one portion of cat food. The sample was "1 ounce" or "29 grams" to be mixed with "1/4 cup water." All three of my cats -- my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair, my two-year-old finicky eater Siamese, and my six-month-old golden tabby, loved it.<br /><br />Then I bought a two-pound box. The directions say to mix 1/4 cup warm water with 1/4 cup Prowl.  Imagine my surprise when I weighed 1/4 cup of Prowl with a food scale and discovered that it only weighs 23 grams and, when mixed with 1/4 cup of water, makes a very watery soup that my cats turned up their noses at in disgust. Thankfully, I had kept the empty sample packet as a reference.<br /><br />I measured 29 grams of Prowl on the food scale, the same amount that was in the Prowl sample packet. To that I added 1/4 cup water. This time, the consistency came out perfectly, and my cats loved it.<br /><br />The "Happy Cat" ratio is: 1/4 cup Prowl (Sample Packet Prowl) i.e. 29 grams of Prowl to 1/4 cup water, and one way is with a food scale. Or you can mix your Prowl up a bit thicker and that will work just fine, too.  What my cats taught me is there is quite a difference in Sample Packet Prowl (29 grams) and the 1/4 cup "Directions On The Box" (23 grams).<br /><br />NOTE: The video mentions food scales, but you can just add extra Prowl if you don't have a food scale. :)<br /><br />My cats find this food very tasty (as you can see for yourselves in the video!) Enjoy your healthier cat! My cats are reaping the benefits and I can't say enough about this food: less shedding, less allergies, and my cats' overall condition.<br /><br />However you get there, I hope you find the purrfect "Happy Cat" ratio for your cat on Prowl!<br /><br />~~<br /><br />>> There is no snooze button on a cat who wants breakfast. &lt;&lt;

review/summary: Great Product, Not So Palatable.
review/text: Okay, cats are weird about a lot of things--new foods especially. Give it some time! I wanted my senior cat on this food because of its very low phosphorus levels which makes this easier for his failing kidneys to process. The moisture it provides once re-hydrated is also a huge bonus as cats by nature do not drink enough water (hence why dry food alone is so damaging to their systems).<br /><br />It took a few weeks of mixing my cat's favorite canned flavors to get him to eat this in larger portions. He still won't eat it on its own but my younger cat loves it (she is not picky). I typically mix up about 1 1/3 cups of the powder with 1 2/3 cups water which makes it a pretty soupy consistency. I store this in the refrigerator over night and it puffs up quite a bit more and becomes a lot more solid and lasts me about 2-3 days. I typically mix about 2 oz (or 2 spoon globs) Prowl to 1 oz of their beloved canned food (shredded chicken/gravy - also grain free) for each cat, each meal.<br /><br />This is one of the highest calorie good quality cat foods on the market only topped by their new cat flavor, Grace which is turkey-based making the Honest Kitchen foods more bang for your buck! I calculated it out and it is cheaper per month than exclusively feeding a canned diet. They also have a point program on their website when you save UPCs which can be put toward a free box (plus other goodies).<br /><br />Don't believe the myths that dry food helps clean teeth. That is like saying munching on pretzels or dry cereal cleans our teeth--you know how much gets stuck in all the little cracks! The only way to truly clean their teeth is to brush them just like people need to. The benefit of a moist food severely outweighs any misconceptions of what dry food does.<br /><br />Better yet! This food is minimally processed. Canned and dry foods go through intense high heat processing which basically slaughters and natural nutrients left in the foods, that is why there is a looooooong list of things you can't pronounce on the labels--they have to add it all back in. Looking at Prowl's label you will see that everything is REAL, WHOLE food and the dehydration process makes this raw meat safe from any contaminates you might be concerned about.<br /><br />There is a trial size available which has a great $5 off coupon on it... FYI! :)<br /><br />I chose to give this product 4/5 stars because I would prefer a product without large hunks of fruit and vegetable matter for my obligate carnivore. There is the occasional whole cranberry or hunk of zucchini/carrot once the food re-hydrates. The Grace flavor has a smoother consistency.

review/summary: The proof is in the (dehydrated cat food) pudding
review/text: I have a Sphynx whose favorite thing on earth is to get fat.  If left unchecked shed have no problem lounging around looking like Jabba the Hutt all day.<br /><br />There are a few traits Sphynx kitties have: They get waxy/dirty ears and nails among other things.  After feeding my cat Prowl for about a month I noticed that her fuzz (hairless cats aren't really totally hairless) was much softer.  Her litter box wasn't as stinky and her ears and nails didn't require cleaning as often.  She also slimmed down to a healthy weight, something that was elusive on even 2/3 a cup a day of Iams weight control cat food. None of this is quantifiable of course, but after having lived with her for 5 years the changes were noticeable to me.<br /><br />Since Prowl is a bit on the expensive side I buy chicken hearts and run them through the blender to mix in with with the Prowl and fill it out a bit.  She loves it.<br /><br />My cat isn't a super picky eater (shes a big fan of sauerkraut) so switching to Prowl was pretty seamless.  My friends cats both refused to eat it cold turkey however.  If you decide to try it don't give up on it if your kitty won't eat it right away.  Just mix it in with their normal food a bit more each day until they are switched over.

review/summary: My cat loves it!
review/text: I got my Prowl three days ago (thanks for the fast shipping Amazon!) and tried it out on my one year old half siamese girl kitty.  When I made it up, I noticed it had a strong roasted chicken smell and my girl must have smelled it too since she came running into the kitchen and meowing for it.  After waiting the five minutes for it to rehydrate, it was still a little soupy, but she didn't mind.  She ate it all at once and licked the bowl clean.  This is unusual since she usually takes her time finishing her meals.  After reading the reviews, I followed the suggestion of making it up ahead of time and refrigerating it overnight so it gets more solid.  So the next morning, when I gave her the more solid form of Prowl, she finished it all at one sitting and licked the bowl clean.  It must taste wonderful since she even ate the dehydrated Prowl I accidentally dropped on the floor.  Bottom line for my kitty, she'll eat the Prowl in any form, dry, soupy or solid.  She gives it a four paws up!

review/summary: take note - kittens need supplementation
review/text: my little guy was 12 weeks when I got him, he's now almost 5 months old. I started him on this as soon as it got here, so he had a few days of straight Evo dry food, then I went to mixing this with the Evo. He LOVES the HK, it doesn't matter what consistency, he licks the bowl clean. He is currently on a mix of HK and Evo dry (mixed together) and HK and Fresh Pet select. his fav is HK all by itself and then HK and the fresh pet - then HK and the evo. He is a very spoiled kitty. HK says you have to supplement the HK with meat, I use the dry kitten/cat formula EVO and the Fresh Pet to vary his diet. He is not a finicky eater. He's never had the runs, never puked, never had any problems with his diet. He's a happy healthy beautiful little guy. I'm very fond of him. I serve the HK like a loose pudding consistency, more on the soupy side. When it's mixed with the Evo he licks up all the liquidy HK he can and then consumes the rest at his leisure. The fun part is I set the time for the 5 minutes and as soon as that timer goes off he comes scampering into the kitchen meowing and looking at me for his food. (of course, he gets a little confused when I use it for other things, "what, where's my food?!"<br /><br />p.s. can't you insert a picture with a review? Why do I only see a video option? Thanks for any help you can give me. I would have posted a pick of the awesome George. (I will love him and hug him and call him George)<br />p.s. 2 going grain free for George, I haven't committed to the completely raw diet, yet.

review/summary: Great product and fast delivery!
review/text: My kitten loves the food and it was here before we knew it! It does take a little bit to prepare the food but it is well worth it.

review/summary: Very hapy with purchase!  Highly reccomend!
review/text: My cat has Lupus and has become more debilitated as times goes by so he is eating less and less (he is 15-16 years old)as time good by.  He does eat the Prowl as well as the Turkey blend called Grace, but he seems to like the chicken based better.  I do min in a 1/4 can of 9 lives canned food with it because he needs all the nutrition he can eat.  I would recommend this to other can lovers.  Very east to prepare 1/4 cup mix and 1/4 cup warm water mix and wait 3-5 minutes, stir again and serve! (your cat may need more or less, but the<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y4TV3K">Honest Kitchen Prowl Cat Food, 2 lbs</a> directions are on the box. BTW  Buy a cheap plastic canister to store the food in once it has been opened.

review/summary: My cats are on the PROWL!
review/text: My 2 picky eaters love it.  I've tried so many foods that they didn't like.  Now, for each cat, I mix 1 tblsp PROWL with abt 4 tblsp hot tap water (stir & let sit for a minute or 2 until sort of a gravy texture) and then with mix this with half a tiny can of Paul Newman food and a couple of cut-up blades of wheat grass that I grow in window.  That's night meal.  Day meal is Organix for Indoors--my babies are 7th floor condo cats.  Both of these alley cats' coats are soft and silky; my kitties look great.  No more wasting $$ on uneaten food.  A bit more time than something you don't have to "make," but they love it so I recommend it.

review/summary: Not the pick of the day.
review/text: I have three cats and have been gradually moving their diets toward raw for their health. All of them have differing levels of finickiness, from an extremely fussy female to my male cat who will eat anything that doesn't eat him first. The first time I offered this to them, they all dove right in... and that was the last time they would touch it. I'm mystified. I've even tried mixing it in various amounts with their favorite canned foods and I end up having to throw it away.<br /><br />Has anyone else had any luck integrating Prowl into their cats' diet? What works? I hate that I've wasted $30 on food they won't touch. That would buy quite a few cans of Core or EVO.

review/summary: Great Asian flavor!
review/text: Just tried this dressing and I really like it!  If you enjoy the soy & wasabi flavors when having sushi then you will love this.  So far I've had on salad with grilled chicken, and just as a bread dipping sauce.  Both were great.

review/text: I've never actually tasted diarrhea, but this is what I'd imagine it tastes like.  I wanted to throw the full can through the window of the gas station that sold it to me, but I was already too far away and would have had to make an illegal u-turn.

review/text: The package arrived very well packed and protected & arrived on time(I ordered 12 bottles). The flavor is very good but for those watching their sugar intake beware...the product contains a lot of sugar (high fructose corn syrup) and is about 230 calories per bottle.

review/summary: Darjeeling Estate tea - Really?
review/text: The tea was average at best and does not live up to the hype or price. Amazon has better selections in this category for similar price. Royal Tea House in Berwyn, PA has great selection of organic Darjeeling tea leaves that can be ordered online. Brewing loose tea to get the best experience takes a certain skill set that must be learned for greater appreciation and indulgence in the "champagne" of teas from the foothills of Himalaya.
