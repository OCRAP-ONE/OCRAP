review/text: My review is for the Cinnamon cookie in the small bag.  I love them!!!  I do not have gluten issues, but I like the fact that the cookies are gluten free.  They are crunchy and satisfy my desire for something sweet.  Only 130 caloriesand 4.5 g of fat in three cookies.  Each pack has 4 cookies.  1.5 g of saturated fat, 0 trans fat, 0 cholesterol, 180 mg sodium, 1 g fiber, 21 g of carbs, and 2 g of protein.  Yummy, every bite.  Starbucks carries them sporadically, and I am so glad to be able to buy them from  Amazon!

review/summary: Yummy, little crunchy cookies
review/text: If you have serious food allergies or gluten intolerance, you probably bake your own (and aren't reading this review) -- but what a joy to find Dr. Lucy's cookies in Starbucks recently!  Yes, these are boxed cookies, not to be confused with homemade, which is the sterling standard for me.  But given that, they're lovely!  The body of the cookie is slightly bean-flavored, since that's what the flour blend relies on; but it's not an obtrusive flavor.  Just a bit tangy.  The milk-free chips are great:  nicely rounded flavor, not burnt or sharp.  The texture is pleasantly crisp & sandy; not tough, not hard, not chewy.  Great with coffee or tea. Our favorite is the chocolate chip variety, but the cinnamon and sugar cookies versions are delicious also.  If you're not allergic yourself, but considering buying some for guests or grandchildren who are, then I'd encourage you to go for it.  You'll find you munch on them, too, because they're just yummy, little crunchy cookies.

review/summary: Very Good
review/text: I discovered these at my local Starbucks and loved them. The sugar cookies are wonderful, have a nice crunch and leave no aftertaste. The easiest way for me to explain the taste of the sugar cookie is to tell you they taste & remind me of Christmas sugar cookies. The chocolate chip are good and the cinnamon are too but the sugar is my favorite. It's so hard to find gluten-free snacks that taste great and don't leave you yearning for a " real " snack. Buy them !

review/text: After being diagnosed as a celiac recently, finding products that are tasty and gluten-free really challenged me.  I traded off tasty for decent tasting after a while, but FINALLY I have found something that actually tastes good.  The crunchy texture makes me feel satisfied after finishing the bag.  These cookies are truly delicious and well worth the journey to find them.  Since God hasn't healed me yet, I am so thankful that He let me find these!

review/summary: Best Allergy Friendly Cookies I ever had.
review/text: I have 15 documented food allergies and it is very difficult to find decent goodies.  These are the best allergy friendly cookies I have tasted yet!  I tried them for the first time today.  I needed to use up a Starbucks gift certificate and found these cookies in a basket in the front of the store.  Boy was I pleased when I discovered they were as good as any cookie made with wheat and eggs. Not the bland, dry, grainy taste of most GF cookies. Also the price is much better than many of the other allergy friendly products I have tried.  You will not be disapointed in these.

review/summary: Crispy Airy
review/text: These are fabulous! I saw in an online review of Dr. Lucy's cookies someone complaining about broken cookies when they arrived. Yes, some of the cookies will be broken, though not a lot. I think they break because of their unusual texture. I wish I knew the trick of making a cookie like this. They taste great, but a big part of what I just love about these cookies is their texture -- it's that airyness and crispness. Personally, they are addictive. I finished my first two boxes (I had bought, as a test, one of the 16 pack boxes in Cinnamon and one in Sugar) and sadly after a month or so I had eaten them all. I tried baking something simliar and couldn't do it -- though when I have mroe time, I'll give it many more tries. So just a couple days ago, I ordered a 16 pack box or cinnamon, sugar, and now I'm trying for the first time the oatmeal. I do recommend these cookies; they are my afternoon treat -- one pack of cookies (only 120 calories) and a good cup of decaf coffee and I'm fine till dinner!

review/text: These were wonderful. I don't know how they make these so crunchy and airy at the same time. I bought a 16 pack box of these and got in the habit of having a bag (only 120 calories for 4 good-sized cookies) of these every afternoon when I got sluggish. I began to look forward to their cinnamony taste and was bummed when I finally finished all of them. I tried to make some like them and it was a sad failure so just a couple of days ago, I ordered another box of these and the Sugar cookies (they are wonderful, too!) and I even ordered the Oatmeal ones so I can try those and see if they are as good as the others. I highly recommend these!

review/text: I absolutely love these cookies. I bought them when they orginally had a discount on them and at first bite I fell in love. Having Celiacs, it's really hard to find a good cookie but the oatmeal in these make them taste homemade. If the price was better, I would have give it 5 stars. Great for lunches or to send with kids when they can't have regular treats.

review/summary: Awesome Cookies and great package size!
review/text: My daughter tried these cookies at a celiac camp she was at and fell in love wih them.  In addition to her loving the cookies, what is great about them is their grab bag type.  Being gluten/dairy/perservative/dye free often she feels different (and a little embarrassed) with the types of foods she eats.  This size is like having something most of her peers eat but it's healthy.  Another benefit is her non-gluten sensitive brother also loves them.  That is the real test, if the gluten eating kids like it!

review/summary: I was pleasantly surprised at how good these cookies are
review/text: I have Celiac Disease and have tried several brands of gluten free "bought" cookies as I call them.  I have always been disappointed and resorted to baking my own.  Although baking my own is fine, sometimes I would like the convenience of being able to have cookies on hand when the urge strikes, or to grab when I'm on the go.  I ordered a "case" each of the oatmeal and the sugar cookies and was very pleased with both of them, although I slightly favored the oatmeal.  I purposely tried to detect the usual "off taste" that I've found in other cookies - there is no "off taste" to either of these flavors.  Both cookies are crisp, just the way I like them....I have just one word for them "yummy"!

I prefer <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating.

review/text: I have a son who is allergic to milk, eggs, peanuts, and tree nuts; however, he can eat wheat.  We have tried lots of allergy-friendly products and are sometimes disappointed with the wheat-free ones as the texture and taste is often very different from products made with traditional ingredients.  That is not the case with these cookies.  They are by far the best allergy-friendly cookies that we have tried yet!  They have a nice, crisp (but not hard) cookie texture.  I was also impressed with the shelf-life on the cookies that we tried.  Many allergy-friendly cookies have a very short shelf-life, but the Lucy's cookies that we tried today didn't expire until October.  Way to go Dr. Lucy on creating an excellent allergy-friendly product!

review/text: As a mom with Celiac disease with one son that has a tree nut allergy and another that has a soy allergy, I really wanted to like these cookies.  We are used to cooking everything from scratch to ensure the safety of our food.  Wouldn't it be great to have a cookie that my tree nut allergic son and I could grab on the go?  I paid a visit to my local Starbucks to pick up a 1.25 oz. pack of the sugar cookies and excitedly opened the package.  The smell alone was enough to immediately turn me off.  The bag had a synthetic odd smell inside.  I took a bite of the cookie and noted its crunchiness-a good thing about the cookie- but then was overwhelmed by an extremely unpleasant aftertaste.  It almost tasted like burnt popcorn with an artifical butter flavor. A very odd and unpalatable taste indeed. I was so disappointed.  I really liked the story of Dr. Lucy and the idea of the cookie, but most definitely did NOT like the cookie. Although I would classify myself as a bit of a food snob with high standards, I put that aside when reviewing this cookie.  I do not think even the less discerning customer would enjoy this cookie.

They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies.

Portion control is also easier with the small can size.<br /><br />I've ordered a few packs of these almonds, and while there is some slight variation in the taste from batch to batch (some are roasted a bit darker than others), I have always found them fresh and tasty.<br /><br />Almonds are relatively healthy too - high in protein, a good source of magnesium, calcium, and manganese, and full of unsaturated fats.<br /><br />I haven't seen organic roasted, salted almonds from this company, but I hope they offer them eventually at a decent price.  One thing I would also like to see is some kind of assurance that the can liner is free of BPA.

review/summary: Perfect little guys
review/text: Yup, no stray pieces, just whole brown almonds. Which is to say that these are not "blanched" - blanching being the process that removes the actual skin of the almond (not the husk) and leaves a pale buff-colored product. And the description of "lightly salted" is accurate. I can barely taste it. The can says the ingredients are almonds, vegetable oil (canola, safflower and/or sunflower) and salt. That's it. Gluten-free. Interestingly enough, there is no indication on either the can or their website whether these are raw or roasted. And I couldn't tell by eating them. But Blue Diamond responded to my email query, saying they are in fact oil roasted - have to be "Pasteurized", per a new California law. [You might want to know that this is a "light" roasting. I would say that it goes part way to a roasted flavor, remaining as healthy as possible while conforming to the legislation I mentioned. My taste preference is actually for the flavor of a fully roasted almond, bad me.]<br /><br />They taste fresh and almondy, as they should. They make a wonderful addition in both taste and appearance, to my just-created Nonpareil Trail Mix which is lo-carb and gluten-free as I am trying even harder to follow this kind of diet. I'm pleased to report that these Blue Diamond Almonds are properly dated: on the bottom of the can it says "BEST BEFORE JUL 20 14". That gives plenty of time to use up six little cans.<br /><br />And about the cans, they seem to be metal bottom and sides, making them superior for storage although the plastic replaceable top with sealed metallic foil under it might be breachable by the ubiquitous rodent. The little cans are nicely reusable.

review/summary: One of my very favorite flavors!
review/text: I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack. This one is one of my favorite flavors and I eat these almonds for a snack because I view them as being healthier than other types of snack foods. This flavor is ideal as you get the freshness of perfectly roasted almonds with just a little dose of salt.<br /><br />One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.<br /><br />This flavor has only 2% of your daily intake of sodium which is good for any snack food.<br /><br />The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is the perfect one for you. This is as good as it gets in snack foods and good for your body and diet.<br /><br />I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.

review/text: If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These almonds are lightly salted and roasted.  They are absolutely delicious.  I could easily see getting in trouble with these since I could sit down and eat the whole can in a sitting and not even realize it.  I snack on them pretty much every morning to tide me over until lunch without having to eat a big meal or something very unhealthy for me.

I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty

It's the same price (about $3 a can) at the local Target.  Plus, and this is a personal problem, I had a hard time being conservative with em.  They are delicious (not as good as the smoked ones though which Amazon doesn't sell for some reason) and I couldn't stop eating them!  I went through two cans in the first night!  I love to snack, but almonds aren't the best for snacking in large quantities, and I won't explain exactly why but it messes with your digestive system.  Anyways, the nuts are perfectly fine and it's a decent price (considering you're not paying sales tax outside of NY and that there's free shipping if you're patient) so I can't not recommend them, although I will never buy em again in this quantity.

review/text: DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are "heart healthy" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the "lightly salted" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4" in diameter by 2 3/8" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay "openned" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds.

review/summary: Straight from Jamaica
review/text: I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other "Jamaica grown" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price.

review/summary: Conscientious Seller
review/text: I was not satisfied AT FIRST with this product.  After posting a less than glowing review, I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new "fresher" bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested, it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco bread to go with it.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt, courteous service.

review/summary: Jablum leaves me nonplused...
review/text: When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it.

review/summary: Nothing to write home about
review/text: Believe it or not, I bought this at a yard sale for 50 cents.  The packaging was perfect and looked exactly like the photo.  It doesn't expire for another 6 months.  I can only figure the seller received the coffee as a gift and had no idea the cost.  I LOVE coffee and figured this would be very good but was so disappointed.  I wanted to see how much it would have cost me had I not bought it at a yard sale and almost fell over when I saw the going price on Amazon!!!!!!  There is NO way on this Earth I would pay the ridiculous amount here, but I will say I like the coffee more now that I know what a great deal I got!  :-)  I decided to try it again this morning and am using the sweetened condensed milk as mentioned by another reviewer (about 3 over-flowing teaspoons per cup - I like sweet coffee).  I also used less coffee since last time I felt it was too strong.  I still cannot pay the going price for this and figure most people on here buy it as a splurge thinking it is neat to drink Jamaican coffee.  I too like to experiment with foodstuffs from other places, but not at this price... Needless to say unless I find another at a yard sale, I'll never drink this coffee again once my 16 ounces is gone... except if I take a trip to Jamaica mon.  :-)

review/summary: Nothing special
review/text: I bought this coffee after watching a documentary on Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee, thinking it would taste exceptional compared to regular coffee.  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas.  We brewed it in the drip coffee maker and also tried it in the French press and neither one of us were impressed.  At this point, our preferred coffee is Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend...it's much cheaper and more readily available.

review/text: A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more.

review/text: Hint, pour on a bit of seafood sauce with horseradish in it and microwave a few seconds to warm up.<br /><br />I just tried a can of these for breakfast this morning.  There were about 9.5 ounces of actual sardine in there and the rest was sauce.  Still not bad considering that's the equivalent of just over two cans of sardines for somewhere under three dollars if you buy them 24 at a time.<br /><br />The fish weren't the freshest tasting I've had, but they weren't that bad either.  At least they're the medium size sardine fish and not the herring you find in the really cheap sardine cans.<br /><br />Here's way to beat the recession and get your protein and calcium.

review/summary: Protein in a snack means Gastric Bypass patients can enjoy with everyone else
review/text: After gastric bypass surgery, you have to eat 50 or more grams of protein EVERY DAY. Sugar-free Protein shakes give you most of it. But you do like to get it from other sources also. You have a very small 1/8-1/4 cup stomach so you can't waste your space on snacks that can't benefit you with vitamins, proteins or some nutrient of value. Also, you can't eat sugar., but you can eat sugar substitutes. So KAY'S NATURALS PRODUCTS ARE GREAT! They have tons of protein and they taste great! These cinnamon toast pretzel sticks are great...the sweetener is low enough in the ingredient list to be able to tolerate it--because there isn't much of it. The white cheddar kruncheeze snacks are great also...they are like cheetos and you like to be able to have a snack when other people do. Also, the Thank you KAYS! You help us take casre of ourselves while we ENJOY food and make eating a little more normal. Lisa

I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor.

review/summary: I love these cinnamon toast pretzel sticks
review/text: I'm floored by the negative reviews.  I started eating these about 6 months ago and am addicted. This item is a blend between crunch and a bit of sweet.  Yes, they are a bit gritty but I never opt back to regular stick pretzels so that isn't a real noticable issue for me.  I saw Dr. Oz introducing new foods to some people one day and he reminded them to taste and evaluate on the item, not as a comparision to what they were used too.  That may be why some folks do not like these.  I love these so much I'm buying in bulk.  But I have changed my eating habits 180 degrees so maybe that's why I love them.  I never go back to the old way I ate as comparision, and have no lingering desires for the junk food flavor.

review/text: The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br />I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price.

My wife and I are one of the popular low carb packaged diet plans that uses a lot of shakes and soups etc.  Plan works great (-40 for me so far!!) but both of us really miss the CRUNCH of biting into something solid; like chips or a taco shell - well these pretzel sticks satisfy that craving and let us keep to the diet much better.  I will be ordering my second batch soon - they are really that good.

They're satisfying and for those of you who have done or are doing the Medifast diet these have almost the exact same nutritional info as the Medifast pretzels and are $9.00 for a pack of 12 while the Medifast pretzels are $16 for a box if seven. These will be a regular item in my pantry now. :)

review/summary: Love the Cinnamon Toast flavor, not the others
review/text: I really like the flavor and crunchiness of the Cinnamon Toast pretzel sticks. And 10g of protein in a tasty convenient, wheat and dairy-free snack is great. I wasn't so impressed with the butter flavor. I think most of the reviewers that didn't care for the sticks were referring to the butter flavor.<br /><br />In response to another reviewer, yes, the package states that this product is made on the same production line as products containing soybeans, dairy, tree nuts, and wheat. That does not mean it is not gluten-free. It may or may not be an issue for you depending on just how sensitive you are.

review/summary: Earthy...
review/text: The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free.

review/summary: Helps my dogs breath and hair
review/text: I have a yorkie who even after having her teeth cleaned at the vet, use to have horrible breath and hair that matted very easily. Since changing her dog food, she no longer has the horrid breath and her hair looks and feels fantastic! I will definitely buy this repeatedly- worth every penny to us!!

review/text: I purchased these for my wedding favors and they were a huge hit! The candied almonds were not too sweet and the mint green color is gorgeous. It was a whole lot cheaper to buy these on Amazon.

review/summary: DELIGHFUL SAYS THE GROUP
review/text: I have 5 cats, of whom 4 live inside and 1 is outside. It is quite difficult to find one food that appeals to this myriad of tastes. Seems like someone has a "no thank you," "are you kidding me", "not on your life'" or a plain "yeech!" on any choice i see that looks just delightful.But no, I am the human Momcat and my tastes are just not the same of those as the princes and princesses in my care.<br /><br />But Merrick Grammys Pot Pie Cat Food has hit the rare airy quality of being one of the few foods that is eaten by everyone, all the time, each time it is served. That is a heady rating. There are only a couple of other foods which have reached that level at our house. One is the White Meat and Chicken by Pro Plan.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ODAS9M">Pro Plan White Meat Chicken & Vegetable Entree Adult Canned Cat Food in Gravy</a> The second is Salmon and Chicken by Tiki<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AN8JDK">Tiki Cat Consomme, 8-Pack, 6-Ounce Can, Napili Luau Wild Salmon and Chicken in Chicken</a>The Third is Tilapia by Fancy Feast.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OPQDDY">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Steamed Tilapia, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 10)</a>.<br /><br />So of all the cat foods I buy, only four are always eaten, by everyone, all the time and Grammys pot pie is one of them. SO the kitters have asked me to try some other flavor by Merrick. I will try, for their sake...for them anything...but I doubt a raging success. Some things always look great at the start, but then do not make it to the "all the time, every time, every one" category.<br /><br />But, my guys give this 5 stars and say "thank you" for reading what we think: Gabriella, Trinity, Wisdom, Mercy, and Yellow Kitty. It is a 5 star meal for us and we think your kids will like it also, so give it a try..."you know, for their sake, or however she says that." "We agree on this Merrick!!!"
