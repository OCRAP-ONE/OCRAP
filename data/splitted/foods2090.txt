review/summary: Buddy Biscuits are the Best
review/text: These excellent treats are just perfect for small dogs! We also love them because of the high quality ingredients...one of my dogs has severe allergies but she can safely eat many flavors of the Cloud Star Buddy Biscuit treats. I also like the fact that they are made right here in California!

review/summary: Unusual gummy candies with great flavor
review/text: I am a huge fan of other Swedish Fish-type gummies (good for vegetarians, no gelatin in ingredients). The red Swedish Fish and Swedish Fish Aqua Life are easier to find nowadays, and I discovered these berries a few years ago at a small candy shop. Yummy! There are three unique flavors in the bag that are reminiscent of "Swedish Fish red" but are somehow completely different. a Must-Try for all gummy candy fans (especially adults and vegetarians)!

review/summary: If made right, it's the best!
review/text: You have to make this cake right for it to turn out it's best. I used this mix for my son's Birthday party. Everyone had cake and enjoyed it. They were all surprised to find out that it was Gluten(wheat), Soy, Milk, Egg and Nut Free. I do say that I make my own fronsting and that can a big difference on taste. My son is allergic to Milk, Soy, Wheat, Eggs and Nuts. When you cook without these ingredients it make's standard baking practices even harder. Here's what I've experienced. First, cooking in a Stainless steel baking pan will cook the cake much better(aluminum is fine as well). I've tried glass and the cakes never cook all the way through and come out dense. Second, the butter substitute mixture is important. I've tried the mixture of someone that made a review on the Chocolate Cake mix(thank you whoever you are). I agree using a 1/4 cup Olive Oil and a 1/4 cup coconut oil is the best. But make sure you use the right oils. The Coconut Oil should be Unrefined and Virgin if you like a slight coconut taste(and I mean slight taste, if none at all depending on where you buy the oil from). The Olive oil is the same. Some manufactures have a stronger taste then others. I use "365" or "Spectrum" Coconut oil, Unrefined, Virgin. You'll have to try out a couple different Olive Oils. I used "365" Spanish Olive Oil. Baking variations vary even for standard baking. Hopefully this will help someone. Please post if you figure something good out. Good luck and happy baking.<br /><br />P.S. My apologies, I made a change to my review. I put 1/2 cup and I meant a 1/4 cup. I made the correction now. And I found one downside on this cake mix. My wife wants me to make it everyday :)

review/summary: Not great but will work in a hurry.
review/text: I was planning to make cupcakes from scratch with almond flour, but ran out of time so I tried this mix. It does not taste great to me. It is very sweet and has the grainy texture of a lot of GF mixes. I will use it again in a pinch, but will look for another brand with more wholesome ingredients like almond flour(and a lot less sugar).

review/summary: confused, but pleased overall
review/text: I have a serious addiction to Swedish fish, but i have always heard the proverb. "if you give a man a swedish fish he will eat for a day, if you teach a man to swedish fish, he can eat for a lifetime" So i bought this worm in the hopes of being able to use it to catch gigantic swedish fish. not only did i not catch and sweedish fish, but I spent a lot of money on a trip to Sweden. (TSA does not know what to do when you pass through a checkpoint with a 3 foot long gummy worm in your trousers by the way.) Then i got to thinking, people usually catch larger fish while deep sea fishing in Florida and whatnot so i have deep sea swedish fishing a try.... also to no avail; however, when i brought the work back up, the balance of the sweet of the worm, and the salt of the ocean was a delightful mixture... overview: The product is what it says, but is not good swedish fish bait. 4 stars!

In case you are wondering Gummy worms, bears etc. liquify at around 156F degrees. What I ended up getting was a triangular wedge about a foot and a half long. But it still served it's purpose as a gag gift.

The box was filled with LOTS of styrofoam peanuts and a little crinkled colored paper. For $39.99 on sale, it wasn't the really nice gift package I thought I was buying.

review/summary: Sugar replacement
review/text: I read in a book that pure Stevia and this product are good for diabetics, and will not spike my blood sugar.  I've cut out all sugar and high-fructose corn syrup in an effort to get in control of my diabetes, and to get me back on track so I won't have to go to insulin replacement.  It means giving up ALL sugar.  I am happy to report I was able to do this-- but it means reading labels, reading labels, reading labels, because sugar and any of it's names for sugar AND even fake sugar is no longer on my game plan, yet is in everything.  I do not like the taste of stevia, even after trying it for a month to get used to it.  However, I can DO SlimSweet!  It does not have a bitter taste, and I've used it in gluten-free products also to create a 'whole grain' dessert cake, which is what I really miss on my new quest for great diabetes readings.  It makes my morning cup of coffee pretty good... So, I would recommend this product for those who want to get off sugar and sugar replacements that are not good for you... Being made of a fruit grown, and having a low-glycemic number makes it a "PLUS" for me.

These are a nice texture and taste, I just wish there was  more meat in the size can I purchase and that they were bigger cuts.  I will have to see if I can save money and buy a larger can or different size cut.  I don't know if I will yet try another brand because I am really pleased with the taste of these clams and that really matters to me/us.

review/text: I ordered this item because it was described as a quality gift basket that you could "share" with friends and family.  And the reviews I read were outstanding.  However, when I got the basket it was extremely small.  It was smaller than my toddler's Easter basket! The food packages were so tiny that they could not be enjoyed by more than one person.  Most of the basket was paper filler.  The basket itself was slightly warped (not too badly) and the bow was made of cheap paper and was much smaller than that in the photo.  I can't imagine how they justify charging this much money for something so small . . . not to mention the shipping!  I was very disappointed.  Thankfully, I had the item shipped to my house so that I could see it before I gave it as a gift.  Needless to say, I ended up getting something else.  Don't waste your money on this one.

This process preserves its delicate flavor and aroma far longer than other green teas. Steeped in hot water, the leaves unfurl, releasing a well-rounded, full-bodied flavor. Rich in fluoride, calcium, and anti-oxidants - and with very little caffeine - this is a perfect choice to greet the evening."<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love green tea, or want a green tea that you can drink in the evening, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi.<br /><br />*****

review/summary: Great EVOO but don't buy it in this container.
review/text: Filippo Berio extra virgin olive oil just might be the best of the widely-available oils. But my advice is that if you buy it, do not buy it in this 3-liter rectangular metal container. Apparently little or no thought was given to how the consumer would get the oil out of the container, and the result is that you should be ready for a messy and wasteful situation when you decant the stuff. I sought advice and was told that it is necessary to up-end the container in a swift move. And of course, to use a funnel. But I suspect that the most coordinated and athletic of pourers would still have a problem; that there is no way to accomplish decanting without spillage. In my opinion this is a serious flaw and I cannot recommend the excellent EVOO in this poorly engineered container.<br /><br />When I bought it, I expected to find a pouring spout installed in the container, one that I could pull out. But my container lacked that... comments suggested some may have them. My experience suggests there still would be spillage.

review/text: This is my favorite Ritter bar - the dark chocolate is intense, but not too sweet nor bitter, and the marzipan reminds me of a slighly more sophisticated Mounds bar, but does not caught in your teeth like coconut.  This flavor combination is the ultimate craving buster.  It's harder to find than the other Ritter bars, but I've finally identified a couple of nearby stores that are always stocked.  Divine.

review/summary: AMAZING !!!!!! BEST CANDY OUT THERE
review/text: This Ritter Sport - Marzipan..... Not enough words to say how amazing it is.  I love dark chocolate and I love marzipan, and this bar gets it right.  The chocolate is more of a bittersweet chocolate, with that chocolate liquor - I haven't tasted better chocolate, and I am an expert in this area.  The marizpan combination is great - its not a huge quantity of marzipan, like in a roll/bar type, but enough for this bar.  This is my favorite.  You will love it, you won't be disappointed.

review/summary: I Thought It Was Just Me
review/text: I was dying to try Ritter Sport Dark Chocolate with Marzipan, so I bought the case!  I love chocolate, almonds, and marzipan.<br /><br />I did wonder how there would be enough filling to taste the marzipan without it oozing out.  No worries there because the marzipan is a fairly thin layer encapsulated in thick layers of dark chocolate.<br /><br />When I took that first bite, I thought, "Something isn't right here."  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste great to me.  The chocolate is scrumptious, but the marzipan seemed, well, treacly.  My husband wasn't impressed either.  We both thought the candy tasted OK but we weren't wowed.<br /><br />I decided to take a poll.  I brought eight bars to work and put them on the break room table.  It's also our meeting room table, and it's where we put treats to share.  There are two possible outcomes of bringing in a treat to my office.  One is that some or all of my coworkers will ooh and ah and carry on about how delicious the treat is.  The other outcome is deadly silence.  These people enjoy food, and they will eat anything.  But if they don't like something, they don't say a word.  The candy bars disappeared, and not one word was said.  My coworkers were not impressed, either!<br /><br />I kept tasting and tasting to determine what bothered me so much.  It seemed there was almond extract in it.  It tastes like there is almond extract to me, and almond extract is a very strong, sweet flavor.  It's true the candy is made with almonds.  Almonds are listed in the ingredients, but so are "natural flavors."  Maybe it isn't almond extract, but I think something in the natural flavors gives the candy an off taste.<br /><br />It's been over a month since I bought the case, and I still have a couple bars left.  The chocolate is excellent, but that filling - meh.  I'm a lifelong chocoholic, and I just don't crave this candy.  I wouldn't mind trying other Ritter Sport chocolates, and I wouldn't tell you not to try this product, but I wouldn't recommend it either.

The Marzipan is nice and moist -- not dry or crumbly.  The chocolate is a very good dark (for a mass market maker).  An excellent combo and if you like marzipan, an excellent choice!

review/summary: My favorite chocolate bar
review/text: This bar had been a favorite of mine for a long time. It was relatively hard to find in supermarkets when I first developed a taste for it, and a bit pricey at the stores where it was available. So when I saw a case of them on Amazon's Friday sale, I jumped at the bargain.<br /><br />I ordered and received this item in early April. The "best-by" date of the chocolate I received was November 3 of the same year.<br /><br />I should note that I had been off chocolate for about a year when I bought this case, due to hypersensitivities, and might not have had this particular product for even longer. So it is possible that I remembered it wrong or my tastes had changed.<br /><br />It is still very good, and is not going to waste. However, I think most of the bars I have opened may have had a barely visible bloom on them, and were a little dryer than I had remembered.

review/summary: Esposito Sausages
review/text: As a New Yorker, I know what Italian sausages are supposed to taste like.  In the last few years, I haven't been able to find good breakfast or sweet dinner sausages in the supermarket.  I don't have access to a regular butcher shop so I started looking online.<br /><br />I bought some from several places & the only ones that caught my attention were Espositos.  They have 2 sizes of breakfast sausages, the little links & some fat ones, the kind they sell at Ihop.  Both are far superior than any others.  Their cheese sausages are wonderful.  I mix them w/ ground beef for meatballs.  It's a great time-saver since all the spices & cheese are already in there.  Very flavorful meatballs indeed.<br /><br />The customer service at Espositos is wonderful.  One time, I ordered the wrong style & emailed them.  Someone answered instantly & corrected my order.  Another time, I wrote for best cooking instructions which were supplied right away.<br /><br />There's always a little something extra in my order.  They sent a cute, little reusable insulated bag which held 4 pkgs sausages in the last one.  This will come in handy in the summer.  Another time, they sent a pkg of hot sausages for me to try since I didn't order that style.<br /><br />Esposito sausages are the best on the Web.  It is well worth the shipping price to stock my freezer every few months.  I highly recommend.

review/summary: Better Sausage Than Some
review/text: I love breakfast sausage, but have had difficulty in finding sausage that is just right. I tried Esposito's Finest Quality, even though it is expensive and was a large amount for a trial, in hopes it would be excellent. I am disappointed with the result. Overall the sausage is of high quality, but contains a lot of fat and its flavor comes mostly from salt. I would prefer less fat, but more importantly, better flavor- less salt, but more sage and other sausage seasonings. There is no accounting for taste and many people raved about this sausage so it is obviously right for many if not most people. Maybe that's why I can't find sausage I like, because my taste is not main stream. I will not purchase this product again, but have nothing against Esposito. In fact they sent a package of their Italian sausage as a sample and we loved it! I will look at the other items they offer and may purchase some of those, but I am still in the search for my kind of breakfast sausage!

review/summary: Great light show
review/text: These are really clever and fun. I saw them at the big Toys-R-Us store in Times Square and bought three (five dollars each). They have four different color LEDs that make a rapidly and continually changing pattern as they spin. The patterns vary a lot, acting like they are randomly generated rather than stored. There are two types: LED's in the hub or in the blades. This model has the LEDs in the hub, which I think looked the best.<br /><br />It spins fast, but the blades are soft and you can stop it with your finger without harm. Runs on one AA cell (probably replaceable). I have never tasted the candy.

I also tried the "Organic Strawberries" and like those better, probably giving them a 4 out of 5. The strawberries are good to eat with dark chocolate.

review/text: I really wanted these to work for travels where I pack all my own food.  However, they are a decidedly poor alternative for travels, since most of the outer coating of the fruit turns into very messy powder.  The strawberry flavor is slightly less of an ordeal in that regards but still messy.  They are probably good for you if you want a stowaway fruit you can use when you haven't gotten to the store for awhile or want it out of season to sprinkle into something, but otherwise the price and messiness are both much too prohibitive.  I've bumped it up from two stars to three, however, after considering how they keep the enzymes intact and don't add sulfites.

review/text: These are very good, but too messy to eat alone as a snack.  The blueberries stained my fingers and mouth.  They are very good mixed with yogurt or in muffins.  Normally, they are a little pricey, but with the instant rebate, they are well worth the cost.

review/text: Previous reviewes told of the mess involved with these, they obviously have not had freeze dried fruit before. Wether it is blueberries, strawberries, lychees or any other fruit, you will have a bit of a mess from the product. Get over it! Wash your hands, brush your teeth. Now for the item at hand, Blueberries. Typical freeze dried berries with good taste and that wonderful powder! Can not be improved.

review/summary: Really good - little powdery but good
review/text: These taste wonderful.  They are a little powdery, which is to be expected since they are freeze dried, so don't breathe in as you're eating.  Fresh blueberries are better, but these are very good.  I saw a few reviews that mentioned everything arriving as powder, but mine arrived in good shape.<br /><br />One thing I really like is that the only ingredient is blueberries.  There's no sulfur (which I'm allergic to) or corn syrup.  These are good in cereal and as a snack, though you might want to have some water on hand in case you breathe in some blueberry dust.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/text: I don't usually buy these kinds of things, but couldn't pass it up when it was on sale a while back. These tasty, healthy treats are perfect for on the go! I snack on them while I am at school. Some fruits have more flavor than others. Raspberries are probably my favorite. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just thinking about them. My only complaint is the price is a little pricey. My girlfriend however doesn't like the tastey treat. May not be for everyone. Taste testing them somewhere could be advised, although I am not sure where you could test them out.

review/text: Taste. A very natural taste. A taste that only God could develop. This is a taste of the promised land (and tastes great with milk & honey). For Weight Watchers folks like me, you'll be happy to know that it's only 2 points / bag. If you're going to a festive occasion, or on a big date, or thinking of using it for your lunch break, stick with Sensible Foods Cherry Berries. But if you're at home, or somewhere where you wont mind getting a little messy, try this. The price is well worth it.

review/summary: Best of the freeze dried, and my whole families favorite flavor
review/text: I started buying these as a "to go" snack for my baby/toddler who is allergic to a lot of stuff.  He loved fresh mangos so I selected this flavor.  Now he loves these so much, he seems to object to fresh mangos.  Now the whole family loves them.  We buy all the other flavors (except blueberries, tried them once -- they'd be okay for baking with, but not a great snack).  I've tried 2 other brands of freeze dried foods and I'd say Crunchies brand is the best -- size of pieces, texture/look of pieces, flavor.  Only improvement would be for it to come in a large cannister size too, and even the 1.5 ounce would be better if it was in a hard sided container like "Just ___________" brand (also okay, but more shrivled up, less like airy).<br /><br />Good Job Crunchies!

review/summary: Low Calorie, Nutritious and DELICIOUS...what more could you want?
review/text: I was at Costco one fine Saturday afternoon when they were handing out samples of the Mixed Fruit Crunchies. I was immediately struck by how flavorful they are! Crunchy, and crisp, not leathery like most dried fruit. On their own they are a fun snack for kids and adults alike. I've also discovered that they make great flavoring agents for frostings, truffles, cakes, etc. I used a mortar and pestle to turn, for example, the strawberry Crunchies into a powder, then used that for the Triple Berry tea loaves and the Strawberries & Cream truffles I made during the holidays. The intense, refreshing, true fruit flavor is what I love about these. And the crunch, but then I'm a texture person!<br />p.s. the other reviewer: It's the banana crunchies you think aren't good, I would bet money on it. My daughter doesn't like them either.

review/summary: Stale and Poorly Packaged - No Reply from Manufacturer
review/text: I've bought these pineapple Crunchies in my local grocery store and they were good (though very expensive at about 6 bucks per serving). So when I ordered the six-pack of them here, I expected them to taste just as good. That was not the case at all. The outside of each package was sticky but that didnt bother me much. What bothered me is that the actual product itself was stale. Each piece (in 4 of the 6 bags I opened) was rubbery. Chewing the Crunchies only compressed it into a solid wad of what then seemed like hard plastic. The result was something that simply could not be broken up and swallowed. I also noticed that the built-in ziplock seal didnt work on these bags. After 4 bags, I tossed out the rest and contacted the manufacturer via email (twice). I never received a reply. I think the Crunchies people are selling Amazon bad batches. Avoid these at all cost!

review/text: Crunchies Blueberries are my new favorite snack. Mine arrived whole and in good condition. There was some blueberry powder at the bottom of the bags, but this is only a problem if you love them as much as I do and insist on sifting through the powder to ensure you get every last blueberry. I haven't tried rehydrating them, as I like them crunchy, but my experience with other freeze-dried items is that they rehydrate well. Incidentally, freeze-dried blueberries are a lot cheaper than dried blueberries, but they retain almost all of their nutrients unlike regular dried fruit.

They'll sate your sweet and crunchy cravings and you'll get all kinds of vitamins and nutrients from them that are really good for you!<br /><br />One another side note, I do sometimes get sulfite-induced headaches and digestive problems from dried fruits, but not with Crunchies!

review/text: I bought these for my 3 year old.  He looked at them and was very dubious of the square little pieces.  So, I ended up trying them.  They are phenomenal!!!  I was holding my 6 months old (who has so far refused all forms of baby food and has only agreed to try the gerber puffies) and he grabbed one off the table and shoved it in his mouth.  It melted in his mouth and he was hooked.  He ended up eating 7 pieces before I cut him off for fear of giving him too much of something he's never had before.  But they kept him very happy for a while.

review/text: Because of the bulk price and the main image on amazon, I thought the packages would be larger, like a bag of Jerky. Turns out that the image you see is not the packaging that you get, the bags are shorter and smaller (see my customer image). At over $4 a bag ($25/6), I'd be better off buying freeze-dried fruit at the local nutrition shop. Plus the fruit pieces are fairly small; good for kids but I like bigger chunks.

review/text: I just received a box of the small bags of strawberry and one of the pineapple. The name is CRUNCHIES, but my fruit is anything but crunchy. It is soft and pliable instead of crunchy. I liked the fact that I could get the portion control bags and also that they are made with just the fruit and nothing added.  I had hoped that these would help me keep out of the potato chips, but they are too soft for that. I will use them but will not be purchasing them again. I have had good success with Bare Fruit Apple Chips, but only one flavor comes in the small lunchbox sized bags that I prefer. The Crunchies website said that if air gets to the fruit it will moisten it up and make it soft. I have to assume that the packaging is to blame as how else would air get into unopened bags?

review/text: Ok, so I have never had freeze dried pineapple before, so I am not sure if they are "good" compared to other freeze dried pineapple. But I found them weird. I mean, they taste like pineapple, but they were not crispy-crunchy like freeze dried strawberries, corn, peaches, and other fruit I have had. The texture of these are not like anything I've had before. As first bite, they crunch a little. Then as your teeth sink in, they are kinda hard-chewy, like those hard caramels. I guess they are just not what I was expecting, based on my other experiences so I was disappointed.<br />I don't think they were damaged in shipment, as it wasn't melted together in one big clump. They were still all individual pineapple chunk pieces.

review/summary: CRUNCHIES IS DISAPPOINTING
review/text: I've tried almost all low calorie freeze-dried pineapple snacks out there. This snack says it's made in the USA, while most others are imported.  One 1.5 ounce package has 150 calories, which makes it about average on the calorie scale.  "Crunchies" freeze-dried pineapple snacks are not chips, like other freeze-dried pineapple snacks.  "Crunchies" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is "pineapple," so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.  If you are looking for a tasty freeze-dried pineapple snack, I recommend "Funky Monkey" or "Crunchy N Yummy" which are both sold by Amazon.
