review/summary: Tasty snack
review/text: I have never tried the similar candies before so maybe I have nothing to compare these with, but I really enjoyed them. It is not too sweet and just has a pleasant taste overall.<br /><br />I think I will be buying these candies for myself in the future. I tried Newman's Own other products and I am happy that this one has not dissappointed me.

review/text: Fruity, chewy and lovely.  I love black licorace. The good stuffy is a delicate balence of chewy and lush flavor. Newmanns own pomegranate licorace is just right. A lovely variation on a classic. Give yourself a treat!

review/summary: yummy little licorice straws
review/text: These licorice twists are very tasty. They are soft and pliable but still chewy and firm. The pomegranate flavor isn't strong, but there is definitely a fruit flavor to them though not too sweet. I like the color of the twists, they look like that deep pink of pomegranates. I really liked that the many of the ingredients are organic. I've been happy with many other Newman's Own Organic products and this was no different. This is a good company that supports good causes, and makes great products. These Licorice Twists were enjoyed by me, my husband, and our six year old. I am interested in trying their other flavors as well. If you find these, give them a try!

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: Even though I consider myself fairly health conscious, I like a treat every now and then. When I was a kid, I ate Twizzlers by the pound and loved the chewy, fruity taste of them. Now that I am an adult I was looking for a healthier alternative, and the Newman's Own fit the bill. As you would expect, this product is free of artificial colors and additives. It is full of taste though, and I esp. loved the pomegranate flavor. One caveat: although this organic, it is still junk food and a serving of these (approximately 5 sticks) have 12 grams of sugar. Still, compared to what is out there, I would buy these in a heartbeat. Lastly, these are somewhat sticker to the teeth than most licorice sticks, so it might be a good idea to have your toothbrush handy after you eat them.

review/summary: A Split Vote!
review/text: When I received my package in the mail, eager to try these new pomegranate licorice, I just happened to have a gaggle of people at my home who flocked around me like little birds waiting to be fed. So this review is based on a roundtable discussion which then ensued.<br /><br />I got this candy because I really like Newman's Own products and pomegranate, so I thought I would love these. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy them. I am more apt to like the lighter, fresher tasting Red Vine sort of licorice rather than the thick heavier Twizzler kind. These were more like Twizzlers, but tasted more like a fruit roll up. It was also suggested that they taste like the red Vitamin Water.<br /><br />Although I did not enjoy them, there were several in the taste test that did. 4 out of 12 loved them and would buy them again. 2 thought they were so-so and might buy them again. 6 of us didn't care for them. In our numbers were two children who eat every candy imaginable, even fruit roll ups - that these taste the most like, but didn't finish their sticks.<br /><br />All this being said, I like Newman's Own products, will keep buying them and trying new things they bring out. I see that they have a Tangerine version of this same candy and will be buying a pack to try them out!

review/text: This is a candy that's just a little different, with a true pomegranate flavor and the requisite hint of cough syrup, since it's licorice after all. The consistency was just right... toothy, but no danger of removing your fillings. For fans of the salt licorice, this would be too sweet, but for me it's just right.

review/summary: Very tasty, great texture
review/text: This is a very tasty variation of the classic red licorice. It has a mild pomegranate flavor and a very soft, chewable texture. I did initially wonder about the corn syrup that is the third ingredient but a friend informed me that it is high Fructose corn syrup that is bad and considered non-organic. You get 15 half ounce packs which breaks down to $2.70 a pack so it is actually a pretty good deal, especially for an organic product.<br /><br />So if you want to try something new, especially if you prefer an alternative to the old red licorice I highly recommend trying this product.

review/summary: Tasty and Addictive
review/text: These licorice are very tasty, the pomegranate gives it a tangier taste than Twizzlers (they are also a little shorter than the popular brand).  It is one of those treats where you say you will have just one and five of them later; you are hiding the package to avoid being tempted to take more.  The only drawback is that like most licorice, you will be picking it out of your teeth after eating it.

review/text: These are some of the most delicious licorice twists I have ever had! I wasn't sure what they would taste like but was pleasantly surprised when they had a punch of sweet and tangy flavor. It didn't take long to finish off this pack of twists as everyone in the house kept going back for more. Even my son, who has never liked twizzlers, thought these were delicious! I like that they are organic and has a short and simple list of ingredients. They are about 100 calories for 4 twists, which is pretty steep, but worth it I would say!

review/text: I liked this product because I love the flavor of a pomegranate.  It could have had more of the flavor as far as I was concerned, so I gave it three stars.  Not as tasty as some other brands, but you have to remember they are using organic sugar so it is a healthy trade off.  But as a bit less sugary alternative to other candies, not bad.  Myself I like the salad dressings much better.  I am not so sure they should try candies, because let's face it, if people are going to eat candy they are going to go for the favorite sugar stuff that they love, but for those who really have discipline to choose a healthy snack, they will love it.

review/summary: Sorry, the flavor's not for me
review/text: I love licorice and try to drink pomogranate juice daily, but the flavor of this licorice was not for me. It reminded me a little of a 'perfumey' artificial grape taste, perhaps because of the elderberry extract listed in the ingredienct list before pomegranate juice is. I actually like elderberries so am not sure why I didn't like this better than I did. The texture was okay, a bit chewier than traditional red vines and more like those long licorice ropes. I didn't detest it, but I can't say I particularly liked it, either. The product is made in Mexico and certified organic by Oregon Tilth. I'd stick with the black licorice flavor when ordering this brand.

review/summary: Average...
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised to find Newman's Own licorice. I've always enjoyed the Newman's Own products, but then realized they are not the same companies. One is Newman's Own who makes the salad dressing, popcorn, etc. while this is another company known as Newman's Own Organics. Either way, I like licorice, and wanted to give it a try. Having picked up a pack, and distributed it to the family, we all enjoyed it, but were somewhat underwhelmed. There wasn't a lot of flavor until quite a bit of chewing. The first bite is definitely disappointing. Having had the pomegranate licorice from Cabela's we expected more flavor. These definitely weren't bad, and we'll eat the entire package easily, but it just wasn't the best pomegranate licorice I've had. Average is the best way I can describe it. If I was offered this licorice in the future, I'd still eat it, but I don't see myself going out and wanting to purchase this again.

review/text: I don't like to give anything of Newman's a three star review because this family gives all its profits to charity, but the Pomegranate licorice needs improvement.<br /><br />A nice idea to add a new flavor to licorice, but the flavor of the pomegranate is somewhat on the weak side and needs to be more full bodied, and the twists are a bit too hard and should be softer.<br /><br />Not bad all around but needs a boost.

review/summary: Pleasing Overall Except For Odd Aftertaste
review/text: I'm a licorice fan, although I tend to only enjoy plain licorice, not the fruit flavors. However, since I also adore tart pomegranate flavoring, I thought I'd try this Newman's Own version.<br /><br />Overall, it had a good, chewy texture without being too hard. It conveyed well the somewhat tart pomegranate flavor I expected, within the limits of what the candy can offer ... which means that licorice twists aren't usually known for sharply focused taste. I enjoyed it quite a bit.<br /><br />The only thing is that there was a brief, odd aftertaste that I couldn't identify but which I didn't care for. As I say, it was fairly brief and faded after a little while. It wouldn't keep me from buying the candy if I was in the mood for pomegranate flavor and licorice twist texture. I mention it to explain why there isn't a higher star rating.

review/summary: Surprisingly good for a non-licorice flavored licorice
review/text: Most non-licorice flavored licorice candy twists or ropes - usually "red licorice" - available are pretty lame.  Mostly sugar, with little flavor other than obviously chemically-induced painfully artificial strawberry basically meant for kids whose only criteria is sweetness. This item from Newman's Own line of products rises above the pack. The texture is firm and chewy - moreso than many of the other licorice "twists" - but it's the flavor that earns the distinction here.  The pomegranate flavor is surprisingly distinct with a tang that is refreshing and not overly sweet-tasting.<br /><br />Being an "organic" product also may appeal to some consumers. Be aware though, that for those sensitive to the corn syrup issue, the third listed ingredient here is corn sugar and not specified as "organic".  These considerations aside, from strictly an enjoyment perspective, this new licorice offering does offer more appeal than most similar products found in the candy aisle.  As may be expected however, price is an issue here.  Enjoyable product but only the individual can decide if this type of non-licorice flavored licorice is worth the money spent here.  It is, however, worthwhile sampling for its distinctive flavor.

review/text: This is very good licorice.  The texture is outstanding: soft and chewy, but with some "bite."  The flavor is subtle and pleasant.  There is no cloying, artificial sweetener aftertaste.  The ingredients are mostly organic.  (However, let's not kid ourselves; this is candy, not health food.)<br /><br />The one and only downside is the cost.  It's considerably more expensive than regular licorice.  Whether the better quality overcomes the high price will, of course, be a matter of personal opinion.<br /><br />But it is very good licorice.  VERY good...

review/summary: Doesn't taste artificial or sugary, but a natural sweet
review/text: I love licorice.  I'm not a huge fan of those neon-colored rainbow packs with funky flavors, so I tried not to be skeptical about the idea of pomegranate licorice.  I'm also not a huge organic food person, though I do try to be as natural and healthy as I can pull off.<br /><br />What I got was a cute package of roughly 4.5" licorice sticks.  Opening the package, I was immediately struck by a delightful aroma that smelled fruity and real, not sugary sweet.  Grabbing a piece, I was expecting a texture like Twizzler, but found one more like Nibs.  It isn't sticky, nor is it a challenge to bite through.<br /><br />Flavor -- it doesn't taste artificial or sugary, but just a natural sweet.  I like it.<br /><br />With a candy, I wouldn't normally get into ingredients, but since this is organic, I thought I'd comment.  First, I can pronounce everything on the list, with the most difficult one being vegetable glycerin.  Corn syrup is on the list, along with organic sugar.<br /><br />Overall, I like this.  I cannot imagine this will become a regular purchase, but I don't buy much candy.

review/summary: Tastes Good and Not Too Sweet
review/text: These Newman's Own Pomegranate licorice twists has a very nice fruity taste without being too sweet.<br /><br />I checked out licorice on Wikipedia and I list some information here for your reference.<br /><br />Toxicity<br /><br />Excessive consumption of liquorice or liquorice candy is known to be toxic to the liver[26] and cardiovascular system, and may produce hypertension[27] and edema.[28] In occasional cases blood pressure has increased with excessive consumption of liquorice tea, but such occasions are rare and reversible when the herb is withdrawn.[29] Most cases of hypertension from liquorice were caused by eating too much concentrated liquorice candy.[30] Doses as low as 50 grams (2 oz) of liquorice daily for two weeks can cause a significant rise in blood pressure. The liver effects can lead to a weight gain from fluid retention of 6 pounds 3 kg of fluid in as little as 3-4 days, but immediately when liquorice is removed from the diet the weight just drops off again as the liver once again achieves equilibrium and the body flushes out the excess fluid.[31]

review/summary: Subtle pomegranate flavor tickles the palate...
review/text: It was interesting to see an organic candy, and not only that pomegranate to boot.  I was a little skeptical at first but this pomegranate licorice was able to pull it off.  The flavor isn't too intense, leaving you with a more subtle initial bite with not really a burst of flavor, but a subtle taste when it hits your tongue.  Where you really taste the pomegranate, though, is in the aftertaste.  It felt like I had eaten a whole pomegranate with the amount of flavor that lingered in the aftertaste.  A pleasant surprise.  Not quite sugary sweet, but a subtle flavor that grows on you.

review/summary: Tasty Candy But A Bit Pricy
review/text: This licorice is very much like Twizzlers or Red Vines in texture, which I like. It is chewy without being too much so and not sticky. The flavor is good. It is distinctive without being overpowering, and no aftertaste.<br /><br />I normally don't care what my candy is made of or how many calories it has. After all, it is candy. I don't expect any healthy ingredients. However, since Newman's is promoting the organic aspects of the product I decided to comment on them. While the brand is "Newman's Own Organics," only three of the eleven ingredients in the product are organic. The rest are conventional. At least there are no artificial colors or flavors. Calorie-wise, Newman's comes off slightly better at 3.1 calories/gram vs. 3.6 for Twizzlers and Red Vines.<br /><br />While the foil packaging may keep the candy fresh on the shelf, once opened there is no way to reseal the package. In all fairness, though, neither Red Vines nor Twizzler packages can be resealed after opening.<br /><br />When comparing 5 oz. packages of all three products here on Amazon, you find Newman's costs over twice as much as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEHSCY">Twizzlers</a> and over 2.5 times more than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FEF0B0">Red Vines</a>. Twizzlers and Red Vines are made in the USA and Newman's are made in Mexico.<br /><br />For me, licorice is an occasional treat. Therefore, if I am in the market and craving a licorice type candy, I would probably reach for these, price not withstanding. I like the pomegranate flavor, and I think I would give the black licorice flavor a try as well.

review/summary: Extra points for using organic ingredients
review/text: Newman's Own products are usually quite good.  I was eager to try out this product because I love fruity licorice twists (and regular licorice,too)and love pomegranates.  I was surprised by my first bite by a slightly bitter taste.  Although that was brief, the flavor was not particular interesting - I couldn't tell that it was pomegranate - it could've passed for strawberry or cherry, in my opinion.  The twists were firm but not stale at all.  They were chewy and I could see getting hooked on eating them, even though the flavor is not anything special.  I might buy this in the store if I was looking for an organic candy snack for the movies.

review/text: Newman's own does it again!<br /><br />These Licorice Twists are the best, most flavorful (Pomegranate, no less!) that I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they are...small (but, that in itself, will not detract anything from the score)!<br /><br />I invite everyone who reads this to try them...delicious!<br /><br />I rate "Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists, 5-Ounce Packages (Pack of 15)"...Five stars!

review/summary: I am officially addicted!
review/text: I love twists. And I love almost anything pomegranate.  So I was predisposed to like Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists.  However I was a bit taken aback at just how delicious they were.  They weren't too sweet - just right.  They filled my taste buds with a great pomegranate flavor--and when biting down gave an almost liquid like sense of refreshment. I tried to save a few for another day but darn it if I didn't eat the entire package of 15 in one day! The serving size is 5 twists with 130 calories per serving.  Not too bad if you can just eat one serving. These are all natural and darned good.  I highly recommend this for a great, organic snack that should be enjoyed by adults and children alike.  I know I am ordering more.

review/summary: It's delicious!
review/text: I thought these twists were simply delicious, but then I love anything that has Pomegranate! At only 25 calories per twist, this is the perfect little sweet to eat anytime. The best part for me is that the sugar is just right and the fact that it's organic is certainly a plus. It still contains Corn syrup but then so does everything around us as well. In short, it's tasty but don't overeat thinking it is organic.

review/text: You really need to be a fan of pomegranate to enjoy this product.  These twists are bit tougher to chew than most licorice twist on the market.  I liked them although I would not rush out to get them again.  My husband did not like them at all--he thought they were too hard and had an after-taste.  A friend thought they were good but she is really love the flavor of pomegranate.  So if you like pomegranate and don't mind a chewier twist, this on eis for you.

review/summary: Nice, but not really licorice
review/text: This candy just tastes fruity. I notice that the last two ingredients on the label (the smallest component of the product) are pomegranate juice concentrate and licorice root extract. There is more citric acid than pomegranate or licorice, and, elderberry extract precedes citric acid. I think that the citric acid gives the candy a bit of tang, but the overall flavor is more elderberry than pomegranate or licorice.<br /><br />This licorice is good enough that I ate the entire 5-oz. package. I didn't notice any after taste, as mentioned by other reviewers. They just tasted like soft, chewy, sweet, fruity licorice - - not bad, but nothing exciting or wonderful.<br /><br />Concerning the organic aspect, the two major ingredients are called organic: wheat flour and sugar. The 4th ingredient, tapioca syrup, is also organic. That's nice and makes me happier than if nothing were organic. But, we're really dealing with candy here, junk food to be eaten in small quantity. So, I can't get too worked up about how organic the contents are.

review/text: Good tasting licorice in a hard-to-find flavor.  I especially like that it is organic.  It's scary these days reading the long list of ingredients of various foods, many of which are man-made additives that I cannot even pronounce.  I think a lot of the "artificial" foods I consume are wreaking havoc with my poor stomach these days.  That is not the case with this organic licorice.  I would recommend this product.

review/summary: Teeth Sticking Goodness
review/text: I'm a fan of many of the Newman's Own products and the philosophy behind them. The fact that the company has donated so much of its earnings to charities is a big plus for me. I wish more corporations were so inclined.<br /><br />Pomegranate Licorice Twists are a tasty addition to the Newman's Own line. They really captured the essence of pomegranate in these twists, something that's not so easy to do. While I enjoy the taste, I found them a little tough, even though the "best before" date on my package is for March 2012. I expected them to be a little softer, but the chewiness didn't hinder my enjoyment of the product overmuch. However, it did cause them to get stuck in my teeth. It was a while after eating before the last traces of these twists were dissolved.<br /><br />Here's a list of the ingredients:<br />Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Vegetable Glycerin, Sunflower Oil, Elderberry Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Licorice Root Extract.<br /><br />The twists are part of Newman's Own Organics division, started by Nell Newman. Organic is great, but it translate into a costlier product. Comparable <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEFWQ8">Strawberry Twist Twizzlers</a> are about half the price and are fewer calories per piece, yet have half the iron and protein of the Pomegranate Twists. Twizzlers taste about as good and are softer too. Consumers must decide for themselves if it is worth a premium price for a snack product very similar to the competition. If you value (mostly) healthy ingredients and enjoy exotically flavored licorice, then it just may be worth it to you.<br /><br />~ Kort

review/summary: A Nice Natural Alternative
review/text: This was an interesting twist:  The kids loved this one more than the adults.  You could pop-psychologize that one to death (children open-minded vs. adults unable to let go of preconceived ideas of what "licorice" is supposed to be), or we could just have weird kids.  In any case, the reviews (over an empty package) went something like this:<br /><br />Adult 1:  "A little unorthodox, but overall I like 'em."<br /><br />Adult 2:  "They taste like medicine and I didn't finish mine."<br /><br />Teen:  "They're good.  A little weird... but good."<br /><br />Kid 1 (age 8):  "I really, really like them."<br /><br />Kid 2 (age 2):  "..."  (Mouth was full of licorice.)<br /><br />The flavor and texture IS different from the corn-syruped red stuff that we're used to.  If you or your Licorice Lovers wouldn't be able to get past that, click "Helpful" below and move along.  It's not different to the point of unrecognizable, like many "all-natural" products, however.  These licorice sticks are smoother and more dense than traditional licorice, appealingly chewy, and the pomegranate flavor adds a bit of a twist.  They are all-natural (impressively no artificial colors) and you'll be able to read and understand all the ingredients, assuring you that you'll not be ingesting anything that once was drilled out of an oil field.  They've even got a couple of grams of fiber per serving.  AND, all of Newman's Own profits go to charities.<br /><br />Those are a couple of facts that you can feel undeniably good about.

review/summary: Paul Newman does licorice
review/text: Good Old Paul Newman, not only was he one of the greatest actors ever to grace cinema, he also created his own line of food products.  Sure tons of people in the entertainment business create products for the masses, but it really seems like Paul Newman's food products have done quite well, despite his passing a few years ago. The product of Newman's that I am most familiar with are the salad dressings, they are great.  So I was interested and somewhat eager to try "Newman's Own Licorice", once I saw this product.<br /><br />The flavor in question is pomegranate and this candy is made with organic sugar.  I have some mixed feelings about this product. I want to say first and foremost it is much healthier than most candy out there.  There aren't a million ingredients and the ones that are present can be pronounced.  Also a serving size is five pieces at 130 calories, which I don't think is bad at all.<br /><br />As for the taste, well that is a different tale altogether.  I really don't taste pomegranate in this candy.  The licorice doesn't have a bad taste, per se, yet it isn't exploding with flavor. As for the size of each piece, well it is smaller than your average piece of licorice.  The package itself is also on the tiny size. Each bag is only 5oz, so this equates to a pricey product.<br /><br />Overall, I think the ingredients, serving size and health awareness of this product make it a worthy item.  However, the taste left a little to be desired.  I would eat this product again, but wouldn't go out of my way to find it.

review/summary: Adult Licorice
review/text: When it is time for an adult licorice, have a Newman's Own.<br /><br />I used to eat packs of licorice as a kid, usually while staying up late watching movies and playing Monopoly.  Well, those days are over. I can't eat a pack of licorice anymore. For one, I would never fall asleep and I would put all of that sugar straight on to my gut.  But it is also that my taste buds are just a bit - a little bit - more mature. I don't like to eat something with all kinds of bizarre ingredients and a chemical aftertaste.  I don't trust a product that looks like plastic and seems to have an odd resin coating.<br /><br />These are worth the calories, and you don't have to regret it later. The flavor of these chews is just so much better than TwizXXX or SwitXXXX. The sweet, dark and tart flavor of the pomegranate is delicious.  It is a genuine flavor. It is also a very substantial chew. You can chew on one of these for quite some time.<br /><br />My wife has no fond memories of licorice. "I can't stand those," she says, when I point to a pack of twizXXX in the candy aisle. "I won't eat them." She means it. But she loved these. She thought that they had more of a cherry taste, albeit a tart cherry.

review/text: I enjoyed these licorice twists. Being the first Organic licorice i will order, i was not sure if it would be different from the licorice i was used to or not. As far as i could tell there was no difference. It has the nice chewy texture that makes licorice unique. The flavour is also quite good.Being organic means it should be a healthier option too. I gave it 4 stars because my children don't like it. They took a taste and stayed off the entire pack. So i guess my kids must have noticed a difference but they could not explain to me what the difference was.So, while i consider it good for adults, note that buying it for children might not work.

review/text: Chewy "licorice" twists, similar to Twizzlers or Red Vines but made with all-natural ingredients.  The texture is exactly what I expected: sort of resilient and gummy, sticks to my teeth.  The flavor is mystifying ... I'm not familiar enough with pomegranates to tell if it really tastes like one, but it does taste really good - sort of like black raspberry mixed with plum.  It's an unidentifiable fruitiness that resembles the taste of "Mr. Pibb" soda on my palette.  Smells nice too.  It's been a long time since I had Twizzlers but these Newman's twists seem to be less sweet than I remember for this type of candy.  I like them more than I thought I would.

review/text: I have always loved flavored licorice, but have stopped eating them because of their poor nutritional value.  Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice twists are an answer to my quest for a nutritious sweet.  The pomegranate flavor is very pleasant and real.  The texture of the licorice is smooth and moist. (It doesn't taste like sugary plastic.) Each serving of these organic sweets contain significantly less amounts of sodium than its competitors, and significantly more iron and protein.  The carb to sugar ratio is 3:1 instead of the usual 2:1.  The licorice actually contains dietary fiber!  While this will not be a frequent treat, it is definitely on my list of healthy snack alternatives...which I am continually building.<br /><br />Barbara Lynette Peters<br />Author of:  Adulterous Heart<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1442188103">Adulterous Heart</a>

review/summary: Nice alternative to traditional licorice flavors
review/text: I'm a lover of both red and black licorice - organic or not is not a sticking point for me but a nice bonus if that's how the product is made.<br /><br />I found these pomegranite flavored licorice twists to be a nice refreshing alternative to the traditional licorice flavors of red and black.  The pomegranite had a sweet flavor with a hint of tartness that was enjoyable, and I found the texture to be just right, soft yet chewy and firm.<br /><br />While these might be a bit pricier than most other licorice brands, if you're looking for something a little different, or as a special treat I think these are worth the splurge.  The fact that they are organic, and have Paul Newman's name on it are a good indication of quality, although I was rather disappointed to read on the back of the package that these are made in Mexico.

review/summary: A good, high-end snack
review/text: As far as candy goes, this is a little on the pricey side, coming out to about $2.67 ($2.27 with subscription discount) per 5-oz pack, which nets you about 17-20 4" pieces. That said, the quality definitely stands up to the price. The flavor is good but not overpowering, the licorice is chewy but not mushy, and it leaves no aftertaste, unlike other pomegranate-flavored foods I've had. The fact that it's organic and healthier than other licorice is a bonus.<br /><br />My one, albeit small, complaint is that the packaging isn't resealable. Twenty pieces is a lot to eat in one sitting - in fact, the package has about 3.5 serving in it. With some bending, though, the package fits in a standard Ziploc sandwich bag (problem solved!).<br /><br />Also note that these candies have expiration dates. It's not that you have to eat them as soon as you get them, but I know some people like to buy in bulk and hide the stuff in the pantry for a year - I wouldn't do that with these.

review/text: I like licorice.  I like the idea, at least.  Usually the licorice I find is too hard, too squishy, smells great but has no actual flavor (twizzlers), makes me sick to my stomach, and/or has ingredients I would never want to ingest.  Newman, that mad magician, has created a product that has none of those problems, and tastes pretty good!<br /><br />The texture is good, a bit harder than perfection, but still good.  The twists are sweet, but not overpoweringly sweet.  Best of all, they actually have flavor, and a very good pomegranate flavor at that!  They're still candy, in this case consisting of flour and various sugars, but at least it's nothing extremely unhealthy.<br /><br />Overall this product did not disappoint and I would recommend it to licorice fans.

To me Red Vines always tasted, well, Red.  The Pomegranate Twists have a pleasant and distinct taste that can be picked out blindfolded or in a dark movie theater.  A serving size is 5 pieces yielding only 130 calories yet there is only .5g of fat and very low sodium.  Best yet, there is some fiber in them there Twists.  The price is actually quite a bit higher than the competition but I guess you get what you pay for.  (And some of the profits go to Newman's charities).  I think I may sneak some of these in to my next visit to the Cineplex.

A chewy stick full of flavor.  The pomagrante flavor I have never tried in licorice before but I'm a new fan.  My husband, on the other hand, thought it tasted like medicine, but still took another piece. It reminds me of the old-fashioned licorice and I would definitely buy this.  I want to try the tangerine next! The only gripe I have is that I wish the package was resealable.  Once you open it, it's hard to preserve the freshness without putting in a ziploc or other container.

review/text: These had a nice flavor, not overly sweet like the ones we ate as kids.  They contain no HFCS or artificial flavors.  The texture is like traditional licorice, just chewy enough.  I do not eat a lot of sweets, but these were quite enjoyable.

review/summary: Love the taste!
review/text: My favorite candy is licorice and this goes above and beyond the "normal" stuff you pick up in the candy aisle.  Most of what you buy just taste like sugar and chemicals while this one has no funny after taste.  I tried the pomegranate which is supposed to have antioxidant properties.  I really had to try hard not to eat the whole thing in one sitting. The best thing about this licorice is that there is real licorice used, which is really rare.  The natural taste of the licorice enhances the pomegranate flavor and doesn't overwhelm it.  I can't wait to try the other flavors.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I love licorice, but I have to admit that my "go-to" licorice is definitely Twizzlers. But, when I heard about this intriguing flavor, I had to try it. And I am glad that I did! It was really tasty! Not overpoweringly sweet, or too overwhelmingly fruity, the balance of licorice flavor and pomegranate fruit was quite perfect. They are also, unlike Twizzlers, already in a perfect straw style, ready to spruce up a summery lemonade as a fun licorice straw! I definitely am not interested in sampling the other flavors.<br />The only downside is that they are rather sticky, both to the touch and to the teeth after eating. These would not be possible for people with braces or fragile dental work! But the strong-toothed will definitely enjoy them!

review/text: I really enjoyed the pomegranate flavored licorice. It had a pronounced and interesting taste.  The quantity in the package made easy to share and being organic makes it healthy then the usual candy.  The only problem I would have is the price, but I would certainly try the other flavors.

review/summary: Yummy novelty licorice
review/text: Classic licorice this is not. If you're looking for true licorice, a European or Australian brand is better suited to traditional tastes.<br /><br />For you Red Vines lovers, red pomegranate licorice will also be an adjustment in taste and texture. I am a Red Vines fan and when I opened the package, I was disheartened to see what looked like Twizzler-style licorice. I won't really go into my hatred of Twizzler brand "licorice," but suffice to say, when I saw the shiny thin ropes of candy, I didn't know if I should even bother trying it.<br /><br />It took a few bites, but my mouth adjusted and now I like it quite a bit. The flavor hints at pomegranate, but if I took a blind taste test, I'd probably never be able to identify the flavor. The texture is a bit like Twizzlers, but it's fresh and actually tastes like food (unlike Twizzlers, which taste like raspberry plastic.) The fruitiness comes through slowly, so take a moment. No artificial colors or flavors, uses organic sugar. These features had minimal impact on me, because it is a processed food at the end of the day. Still, I liked. I might go for these instead of the Vines at the movies. A good alternative to my old standby. Recommended.

review/text: I'm a fan of the entire line of Newman's products. This licorice is slightly softer and easier to chew than other major brands. The pomegranate flavor is original and, I thought, quite good. My one disappointment is that, while the sugar used is organic, there is regular corn syrup used.

review/summary: Pomegranate Licorice - Delicious
review/text: I got ahold of Newman's own Pomegranate Licorice and was amazed at the taste.  I love licorice, especially the 'unexpected' flavors. Usually its a blueberry or a strawberry, the occasional peach.<br /><br />Leave it to Newman's Own to come up with Pomegranate. if you are considering buying, I highly recommend it. The flavor is solid (pops nicely in the mouth), the consistency is soft (as opposed to break-your-teeth-twizzler hard) and the packaging kept it quite fresh.  All in all, a win all the way around.<br /><br />From a dietary standpoint, here's what was on the packaging (incomplete, refer to the packaging for complete nutrition facts):<br />Serving size : 5 (there's 15 in the bag so 3 servings)<br />Calories  : 130 Calories from fat 5<br />Sodium  : 5mg<br />Total Fat  : .5g (1%)<br />Total Carb  : 32g (11%)<br />Protein  :  2g<br /><br />Hope this helps!

review/summary: My kids liked it, I didn't
review/text: I tried this product as did my children, who ended up devouring the entire bag. I had one piece and let me tell you, that was enough for me.  It was soft and chewy, which was good.  Unlike regular licorice that is hard, I really did like the fact that this was kind to your teeth.  The taste was ok, at first, but then it left a really bad after taste in my mouth.  It was just kind of weird.  I liked that this product was made with healthy ingredients, but I didn't like the yucky after taste.  Overall though, as far as my kids go, this is a healthier treat (as compared to pure candy with unwanted perservatives) that they actually like.  Because of that, I did appreciate this product more.

review/text: I liked this product quite a bit.  It is a significantly higher quality licorice than typical "Twizzler" fare, and it has a unique tasty flavor.  It also melts in your mouth, which is kinda neat.  Overall I like it quite a bit and would recommend it if you enjoy licorice for both the unique flavor and quality licorice.

review/text: If you like licorice, you're bound to like Pomegranate Licorice, a new flavor from Newman's Own Organics. And as candies go, it's fairly healthy with little fat and sodium and not too many carbs. As you would expect from the Newman folks, it's all natural with no artificical flavor or colors. It is simply delicious.<br /><br />In addition to pomegranate, you can get this candy in black, strawberry and  and tangerine as well.<br /><br />If you are looking for items made in the U. S., you will have to look someplace else, however, as the wrapper indicates it was made in Mexico.

review/text: They're very delicious, so much so that you have to resist eating them all in one sitting.  I ate them over two days.<br /><br />But how healthful are they? They're marketed as healthful. Organic. No artificial colors or flavors.  That's all good.<br /><br />My biggest sticking point is that the ingredients list corn syrup.

That's why I'm deducting a star.<br /><br />Here's a full list of ingredients:  Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, Corn Syrup, Organic Tapioca Syrup, Vegetable Glycerin, Sunflower Oil, Elderberry Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Licorice Root Extract.<br /><br />Serving size: 5 pieces.  130 calories per serving.  (That's 26 calories per twist.)<br /><br />"About 3.5" servings per container.<br /><br />They taste good, if you don't mind the sugar and corn syrup.

review/text: Wow.  What an improvement on the old red licorice!  The pomegranate juice, combined with the elderberry extract makes for a truly tasty treat.<br /><br />I used to relish eating the first stick of traditional red licorice, but by the time I'd finished, the artificial flavoring in that one stick alone had turned my stomach.  Not so with these.  A real quality product, as is typical with Newman's Own Organics.<br /><br />My only suggestion would be in improving packaging -- it would be nice to have a resealable package so that these don't go stale, get tough, or lose their intense flavor after being opened.  Opening the package for the first time releases an incredibly intense aroma, and I'd hate for that to fade over a few days.  Not that big a deal, though, and these are just leaps and bounds better in taste than any red licorice candy I've ever eaten.  Fantastic product!

review/summary: Good and (surprisingly) good for you!
review/text: Newman's own Organic Licorice has the taste and texture of old fashioned licorise so hard to find now.  Beyond being good candy it is not only free of things which are bad for you and actually contains several which are good for you! Licorice is a known anti-inflammatory, as is elderberry, and ingredient seldom found in American food products but widely used in Europe is also an anti-infammatory and has recentl7y been found to have anti-viral properties as well.  It also contains fruit and some sugar (not high fructose corn syrup!) as well as some corn syrup (natural, not chemically altered).  I am always happy to find a product I feel good about buying and good giving my kids.  In addition to making healthy and safe products, Newman's philnpthropy is reason enough to support the brand.  This, however, is not something that I would buy out of any any sense of altruism.  Even if you don't care about what you put in your body, or the this of the company producing your food, this is about the best licorice you can get without going to a gourmet store, ethnic market or importing it yourself.  Off to see if Amazon has this available on subscription (though having it around all the time could prove a bit dangerous)!

review/text: Has a taste in near red licorice but I like this a tad better.  The problem is that I don't find red licorice that good to begin with -- I'm more of a black licorice person.  It's nice that this is organic and used natural sugar, note.  Also, I shared this with my co-workers.  About 50% enjoyed it, 25% thought it was disgusting, and another 25% thought it was just okay.  Packaging is nice with shorted sticks than conventional licorice packages.  Five sticks is 130 calories.  Contains 4% calcium, 6% iron, and 1% sodium for daily percentage.

review/summary: Organic Ingredients and Tangy Pomegranate Licorice Chew
review/text: Newman's Organic Pomegranate tastes a bit like a tangy twizzler.  They are delicious: each twist is about 4" long and 5 pieces come in at about 130 calories. There are about 20 pieces per pack.  So these candies a great little pick-me-up for my desk drawer.<br /><br />For those of you interested in the organic aspect of Newman's Own, the good news is that the main ingredients are certified organic.  I appreciated that the 3 of the first four ingredients are certified organic (Organic Wheat Flour, Organic Sugar, & Organic Tapioca Syrup).  There is a distinction between organic and "natural" labels on products. Organic certification involves rigorous inspection to make sure the food source is pesticide-free, hormone-free, among other things.  The remaining ingredients were ones that I felt comfortable with eating (Corn syrup, Vegetable Gycerine, Sunflower oil, Elderberry extract--which is great for the stomach--, citric acid, Natural flavor, Pomegranate juice, and Licorice Root extract--also great for stomach ailments).<br /><br />To be clear, organic or otherwise, it is candy. And it has plenty of sugars in it.  But for me, when I'm dragging in the middle of a long day at work, a little piece of candy helps even out my blood sugar and holds me over until I can get home and eat dinner.<br /><br />The distinct flavor of Pomegranate comes through in these tastey licorice twists.  If you're looking for a candy that is a little different but still delicious, I would suggest these Pomegranate twists.  If you like twizzlers, Newman's Pomegranate twists taste even better and their organic source materials mean that you are eating higher-quality foods.

review/summary: Bitter After-Taste
review/text: Newman's Own has branched out quite a bit into different types of organic foods since it's beginning, most with a good degree of success. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about this licorice. I am addicted to licorice (yes, even black licorice) and the thought of a pomegranate flavor was pretty cool, since I really like that fruit. So I can say the concept was better than the actualization.<br /><br />This licorice is a bit tough, and doesn't seem to have a very strong flavor. There is a bit of tart pomegranate, but I'm not sure that most people would be able to identify the fruit in a blind taste test. However, the flavor was good enough to keep me eating. What wasn't very good was the after-taste. I'm not sure what in the licorice would cause it, but it hits fairly quickly and does not fade very fast. It's sort of bitter, and is not very pleasant. The semi-good news (I suppose) is that it does not increase with the consumption of more licorice - it just stays constant, there in the background.<br /><br />I haven't tried any other flavors of their licorice (if they have any) to know if there is an after-taste with those as well, or if it's something to do with the pomegranate flavor. But I can say with some certainty that I will not be buying this licorice of my own accord.

review/summary: Good quality licorice, but the Pomegranate flavor is not for me!
review/text: I was excited to try these and when they arrived in the mail I opened the package, closed my eyes and got a whiff of an almost medicinal smell.  The weather is quite hot now, and the package was warm when I opened it so that might have contributed to the smell. The texture was quite nice, chewy, not hard. The taste, however, did not appeal to me and the licorice did have an aftertaste that I did not care for.<br /><br /> I liked the packaging, the size of the licorice, and the amount contained within the package - I just did not care for the Pomegranate flavor and would like to try some of the other ones available.<br /><br />I also wish it was made in the USA instead of Mexico, but I have to think that because of the reputation of Newman's Own products that it is being made under the strictest of regulations. That being said, I still wish it was made in the USA.  I was surprised to see that it wasn't when I looked at the packaging.

So I simply have to point out that I feel that the price is expensive for a 5 oz bag, and that's why I can't give it 5 stars.<br /><br />In the end, this pomegranate licorice is one delicious treat!

I search out organic and I am willing to pay the price for it.<br /><br />I am an avid buyer of Newman's Own products, and like their other products. The pomegranate was high quality and tasty.<br /><br />Compared to the major brand licorice, Newman's own pomegranate has 10g of sugar and 2g of protein compared to 18g and 1.3g respectively. The first ingredient in Newman's own is Organic Wheat Flour while the other licorice is corn syrup.<br /><br />The taste of the Pomegranate licorice is strong and sweet. The Elderberry added is more pronounced than the pomegranate. Non-organic corn syrup is in the product(third ingredient).<br /><br />I can taste the quality in the product and recommend it.

I would buy this, although I question any health benefits from the pomegranate, seriously.  It's the trendy thing for the early 2010's me thinks.  It is fine candy, short pieces.  Australian was the best I have ever had.  I can't help keep thinking of Earth Shoes with the pomegranate, but with the Newman's name, I figured it to be very good, and it is.  It is without question the best pomegranate I ever ate.  I ate the whole bag in about 1/2 hour, yeah, that good. Profits are shared or given I believe, that is good.

review/text: I really wanted to try these. I love pomegranate and it is truly a very difficult flavor to nail. And I must admit that these do not exactly do the flavor justice. But what it does do right is that it has a linger flavor of pomegranate that seems very natural. Newman's licorice does use concentrated pomegranate juice, and once you get it going, the flavor sneaks up ... and you suddenly find yourself wanting more, almost needing it. It is deceptively refreshing.

review/summary: Bumped Up
review/text: I'm a fan of both the late, great Paul Newman and his Newman's Own line of organic food products, if only because the profits from the latter are donated to various charities. It's my understanding that the profits are considerable and I would have to assume that this is due to the fact that so many of the products actually TASTE good; the ingredients are not only organic but are responsibly selected to yield results that are both delicious and as healthful as possible (bear in mind that most of the line consists of snacks and such and that no one is suggesting they should constitute the bulk of one's nutritional intake). Newman's Own Organic Pomegranate Licorice Twists are no exception.<br /><br />One can't get too lyrical about something as prosaic as twist candy but this one really is good. The flavors used are natural and a number of the ingredients used are organic. Please note that corn syrup and HFCS are NOT synonymous and that the inclusion of the former (for chewiness) shouldn't be confused with the latter. The twists taste a lot better than Twizzlers, that's for sure and the texture is licorice perfection: very soft and chewy, even after leaving them in the open package for a few days. My only complaint is that I wish the flavor was both a bit more intense and tart, then I'd rate it "perfect."<br /><br />I have to admit that I wasn't thrilled to read that this product is manufactured in Mexico. I'm sure there are reasons for this, probably economic, but it doesn't make me happy. However, at least it's the same continent so perhaps I shouldn't be slug about it. Regardless, it's still a good product and likely to be enjoyed by kids as well as grown-ups. 4� stars bumped up to 5.

review/text: "Pomegranate Licorice Twists" by "Newman's Own Organics"...  WONDERFUL, GREAT TASTING!  Nice, flexible `almost' soft, very pliable.  Sticks into one's teeth just like the others.  MUCH BETTER than that  red licorice found in that plastic tub offered by the BIG BOX discount stores.  Your teeth can easily cut through this stuff; you don't have to twist it around nor risk ripping your teeth out when you take a `chaw' out of it.  WOW, I just ate 4 of these in one sitting!  The Pomegranate flavor is REALLY flavorful - I wasn't expecting it (also available in Black, Strawberry, & Tangerine - I can't wait to get a hold of those, too).  It is packaged as `organic' - it has organic wheat flour, organic sugar, and organic tapioca syrup, with other suff.... `certified organic by Oregon Tilth' even though it is made in Mexico - may be organic, but it tastes GREAT!  I'm not a chemist so I don't know whether or not that `improves' this treat's flavor or not, or even if it is any healthier -- but the strong, in-your-face, I can tell it's activating my taste buds -- Pomegranate flavor really works for me.  My parents liked them, too.  Good high quality flavor.

review/summary: Odd flavor
review/text: I've had many of Newman's Own products & have, for the most part, liked them all.  I love that Newman's Own is totally organic & will continue to buy their products.<br /><br />When I first put the licorice twist in my mouth, It tasted much like any other licorice twist.  Mid way through the twist I got a burst of flavor I couldn't identify.  The package says Elderberry Extract,  Pomegranate juice concentrate, etc.  I didn't care for it, in act, the flavor lingered in my mouth for a short time afterward.  Personally I wouldn't buy again.<br /><br />I will, in fact, try another of their licorice flavors.

review/summary: Tasty, sweet, brings back memories of childhood
review/text: My wife and I use various Newman's Own products regularly, so I thought this might be a good choice for a relatively healthy "cheat". First of all, the taste is great! It's reminiscent of the good old red licorice you may remember as a kid, but has a subtle pomegranate flavor that is quite nice. I set out to taste just a few sticks and ended up eating almost the whole pack--very addictive.<br /><br />For those with wheat allergies, the first ingredient in these is organic wheat flour, followed by "organic sugar" which is too generic a description and could mean anything from raw cane juice to processed sucrose from organic sources. Don't overdo it and you won't overload yourself with too much sugar. The rest of the ingredients follow: Corn Syrup (beware), Organic Tapioca Syrup, Vegetable Glycerin, Sunflower Oil, Elderberry Extract, Citric Acid, Natural Flavor, Pomegranate Juice Concentrate, Licorice Root Extract. That's a lot of different sugar sources, and the "Corn Syrup" is something to be wary of.<br /><br />All in all, it's a slightly healthier sweet treat than buying the usual dime store or movie theatre red licorice, but not much. It does taste very good, and don't be surprised to eat the whole pack once you open it (15 in a pack). Recommended, but watch the sugar intake.

review/summary: Yummy and Fruity
review/text: Licorice is a weakness; hard to open a package and not keep continually returning for "just one more."  Newman's organic pomegranate, in that regard, is pretty hard to resist.  Very tasty little treat for adults and kids alike, and the fact that it's organic makes it even more enjoyable.  Tasted a hint of ripe berries, in addition to the pomegranate, and I'm not sure I would have easily identified the flavor without the packaging.

review/text: I do like licorice.  I do usually like Paul Newman products.  I feel that they can be counted on to be quality products.  However this product was not to my taste at all.

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste and very expensive
review/text: Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists are a unique candy, to be sure. I'd never heard of a pomegranate-flavored licorice before, so I was anxious to try it. First the good: The pieces are firm and chewy (I like a little substance to my licorice), they're a good size (about 2 inches shorter than a Twizzler), and the pomegranate flavor is nice. Now the bad: While the flavor is good while you're eating the licorice, a bitter aftertaste lingers (I had to either immediately take a drink or shove another piece of licorice into my mouth to get rid of the aftertaste), and the price is outrageous. At 53 cents per ounce, this licorice is four times the price of  Twizzlers. Is it four times as good? I don't think so. While I enjoyed trying these licorice twists, I won't be buying them in the future.

So I thought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003XDH6M6">Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice Twists</a> would be something I could love too.<br /><br />Wrong!<br /><br />The flavor is good.  The texture is as licorice should be.  But the aftertaste is just too much.<br /><br />For several days after eating this Pomegrante licorice, everything I ate tasted like Pomegrante.  EVERYTHING.  Dr. Pepper had an underlying taste of Pomegrante.  Tacos had an underlying fruity Pomegrante taste.<br /><br />Ugh, too much for me.<br /><br />Unless you really, really, really love the taste of Pomegrante and don't mind it being present in the next 10 meals, then I'd recommend skipping this organic treat.

review/summary: Not too sweet, not too flavorful
review/text: OMG! *Another* Vine review of Newman's Own Pomegranate Licorice Twists?  Yeah...<br /><br />Anywho, I'm going to start off by saying: My wife really likes these.  She finds the flavor prevalent but not overpowering and the sweetness isn't cloying like Red Vines.<br /><br />I'll follow that up by saying: I adore Red Vines, I loathe Twizzlers, and these are somewhere in-between.<br /><br />To the reviewer who wrote:  "they had a kind of weird wheat flavor and heavier texture, which is not the kind of thing you want to taste when you're thinking red licorice" I can only say: I 100% agree. I grab a licorice twist and I want that sweet, chewy Red Vines (or even Black Vines) experience.  These do *not* deliver that.  While they do manage to stick to your teeth, they're not particularly chewy; they're somewhere closer to a crumble than a chew.<br /><br />And I was expecting to be wowed by tart pomegranate flavor.  I was completely let down.  The flavor is mild, at best... and reminds me of pomegranate, but not overly so.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd have rated these 1 star, but since the wifey loves them, I'm upping it to 3. Like Twizzlers?  You'll probably like these.

review/summary: you can taste the pomegranate....
review/text: Sorry, I'm not a huge licorice fan, but I do love pomegranates.  I was looking for a low calorie treat ... to be used while long distance driving to keep me awake.  I often use beef jerkey for this purpose.  Anyway, the licorice is ok and it does taste somewhat like pomagranate - and NOT like regular red licorice.  That is why I gave it three stars... it is what it's advertised to be and is quite chewy.  However, I really did not like the aftertaste and it made me feel a bit nauseated for an hour after I ate the first one.  This is why I only gave it three stars.<br />Now perhaps I just was due for a stomach ache, but I'll be checking other reviews to see if anyone else had this happen....

review/summary: Not my favorite; just OK
review/text: I have made pomegranate syrup before and it had about the same flavor as this licorice. The problem with pomegranate is  that when it is cooked (reduced) it changes flavor, becoming somewhat bitter in the process. I was hoping that this product wouldn't show signs of that, but I was wrong.<br /><br />The texture is great and if you like the flavor, then this is a fine product. It boasts being organic and uses sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup (there is corn syrup, just not modified), both are plusses in my book. Plus Newman's own donates profits to charity, another plus.<br /><br />But it is a bit expensive for something made in Mexico. At $40 for 15, 5 oz packs, that's about $8.50/pound. A little high for licorice made outside the country.<br /><br />Bottom line is, I ate the whole thing, so it couldn't be too bad. My daughter thought it was OK, too. But I rated it down for the slightly odd flavor, high price, and unnecessary outsourcing to Mexico.

review/summary: Pomegranate is suprisingly good ... but does take a bit like Fruit Roll-ups
review/text: As a reviewer for licorice, I believe myself to be well qualified.  Every trip to the store, I go down the candy aisle, to if nothing else, pause to decide if licorice is on the mental shopping list.  I must admit that I've never seen this offering in any grocery store, but on my next trip to Whole Foods, I'll certainly take a look.<br /><br />Overall, the licorice is quite tasty but not what I would call addictive.  It definitely was fresh and closer to "Twizzler" consistency than "Red Vines".  I usually buy Red Vines that are both tasty and inexpensive.  I believe that the makers of this licorice were aiming for the 1930s type of candy store licorice instead of the mass produced taste of Red Vines.  If you examine the price of 40 dollars (Amazon's listed price) for a total of 75 ounces (pack of 15 x 5 ounces per pack = 75 ounces), you'll quickly see that the price per pound is about $4.25 a pound (16 ounces).  This compared with other higher produced licorices is much more than a 3:1 cost of either Twizzlers or Red Vines.  Clearly, Newman's Own Organics is going for the more discriminating licorice consumer.<br /><br />In summary ...<br /><br />Pros<br />Very tasty<br />Fresh<br />Decent consistency<br />Organic (although I honestly don't know how big a benefit this is for licorice)<br /><br />Cons<br />May be costly for the average consumer<br />Tastes a bit like Fruit Roll-ups (making it a bit of a Fruit Roll-ups for adults)<br /><br />Happy Eating!

review/summary: Good texture; only for those who like pomegranate taste
review/text: Red Vines are one of my "guilty pleasures." I like pomegranates and miss the tree that supplied them to me in Tucson, long before the pomegranate-as-antioxidant craze. I wasn't expecting some pomegranate taste to assuage my guilt about eating what is one-quarter sugar (while not caring if the sugar derives from organically grown sources), and it didn't.<br /><br />I was hoping that the Pomegranate Licorice Twists would have more pomegranate than anise taste, and they did--even with elderberry juice being higher on the list of ingredients than pomegranate juice. (I don't remember what elderberry juice tastes like, but think the twists take like sugar with some pomegranate. I guess that neither the pomegranates or elderberries are organically grown, nor is the corn used as corn syrup...)<br /><br />The twists are about two bites in length (compared to the three of Red Vines). The soft/chewy balance seem right to me. My Costco plastic casks of Red Vines dry out, and I have no doubt that these would if I let them. (Alas, the packages are not resealable.)<br /><br />I like the twists and the philanthropies of the company. Some have complained of an unpleasant aftertaste. I don't experience this, but my mouth feels a bit dry after eating one or two twists.

review/summary: Different but made in mexico
review/text: Pomegranate is an unusual taste but one that you usually find combined with something else.  However here I found myself wishing it was a different licorice flavor.  It's sweet and tangy...but just one of those tastes that neither wows me or turns me off.  Just an average candy flavor in my book...<br /><br />Reading the package states it is made in mexico which when it comes to food I rather not see...especially on organic labeled items that should have a higher health standard.  Organic here of course just refers to the sugar used.<br /><br />All depends what you're looking for but it isn't something I'd choose again because of where it is made.

review/summary: Decent Taste--Mushy Texture
review/text: Newman's Own Organics Pomegranate Licorice met mixed reviews in our home.<br /><br />Pomegranate has become the new flavor of choice with many products--especially beverages and snack foods. This is due to the increased emphasis on the important of anti-oxidents, the anti-oxident benefits of pomegranate, and the cosumer's desire for the "next new thing" in exciting fruity flavors.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics authentically brings together both the flavor of licorice and pomegranate. The folks in our home that loved pomegranate enjoyed the taste of this treat. The folks less accustomed to this ancient fruit simply felt the licorice was adequate.<br /><br />Most of the complaints about the licorice had to do with texture. This licorice had a mushy quality, which is disappointing those that like a sturdy chew with their licorice. It is braided, but not tightly braided.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fun snack for us to have, but not something we will be looking to buy more of.

I just can't see ever wanting it enough to purchase it or crave it.<br /><br />Positives: Perfect texture and 'bite' for a licorice candy. Just chewy enough without killing your teeth. Good flavor, if a bit medicinal. The organic label is nice however not all the main ingredients are labeled as organic although most of them are. No artificial color or flavor. Very low in fat and not too bad in calories - about 26 per piece.<br /><br />Negatives: The flavor doesn't really say pomegranate to me. It's sweet, kind of fruity and a little bit like medicine instead of candy. The package should be resealable as the contents are larger than a single serving and it's a little on the pricey end of things.

The products are more expensive, but on the whole, well worth the price. However, in this case, I am confused about the price of these delicious chews. Amazon advertises 5-ounce package, pack of 15, for $40.04. That would mean that each licorice piece costs over $1.60 a piece. That seems to me to be an outrageous price.<br /><br />The pomegranate licorice twists are delicious. They are advertised as having 70% organic ingredients. There are no artificial flavors or colors and the color is a dark ruby red, the color of pomegranate. Pomegranate is the fruit of the year, and you will find it in many different products. Each twist has 130 calories as stated on the packaging. My package contained 17 twists, and the package states pack of 15.<br /><br />Chewy and good tasting.

I have found other (supposed) Natural products to have much more intense flavor than this Newman's product, so this will not be a repeat for me.

To me, these taste like medicine. I think it's the elderberry that's in them. When I'm sick, I drink that stuff like crazy so I think for me, elderberry and medicine are inextricably linked at this point.<br /><br />But really, why is there elderberry in these? I really wanted a nice tart pomegranate flavor and I feel like I can barely taste it. Even my sweets-obsessed 3 year old didn't like these. I'll try the black ones next. Hopefully they are better.

review/summary: More rope than licorice
review/text: I will say this, the licorice is very flavorful, however, it is really hard to gnaw on. Maybe we got a not so fresh pack. Maybe we're use to softer licorice. To be honest, my sons and I prefer Lucky Country flavored Australian licorice more. That licorice is juicy, soft, and more flavorful than Newman's Own.

review/summary: not sweet, a bit pasty
review/text: This is an interesting product. My advice, if you're looking for an alternative to "candy" licorice or twists, you'll want to avoid this. If you're looking for a better type of licorice, than this product might be good for you.<br /><br />I'd describe this product as "old-fashioned". It seems to be made in a way in which many mass-produced licorice products aren't made anymore. Most interesting are the ingredients: organic wheat flour, organic sugar, elderberry extract, and pomegranate juice concentrate. While "organic" isn't necessarily any more healthy for you than non-organic products, the "wheat flour" is very interesting, and probably helps add the 2g of fiber to each serving.<br /><br />If I had to describe the taste -- I'd say "sour". The first piece you eat will be "curious", but if you eat an entire 5-piece serving (3.5 serving in the package), the flavor actually improves. I do think the use of wheat flour makes them a bit "pasty" or "chalky". And pomegranate isn't necessarily sweet -- so expect a tart experience.<br /><br />Bottom line -- the kids won't like this, but health-conscious adults may.

review/summary: Difficult to Taste Pomegrenate in These Twists
review/text: Looking hard for pomegranate flavor, it was really hard for me to find one in these Mexican made twists. They are just like ordinary licorice twists, that are somewhat sticky, and exorbitantly priced for only "70% organic". Carbohydrate content is 11% in these twists, so these are definitely not healthy. But using "organic" sugar  gives them the excuse to charge preposterous price.
