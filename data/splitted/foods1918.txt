review/summary: Moroccan Tea
review/text: Moroccan Tea is something that varies pretty dramatically, depending on the kind of mint that's used, and the quality of both the tea and the mint.<br /><br />I've bought Moroccan tea before that I've been pretty disappointed in, and have to say that this is one of the better blends I've had. My son got me started on Moroccan tea when he brought some home to me from Morocco once, and this blend seems closer to that authentic blend.<br /><br />I like the mix first of all - it seems a bit heavier on the tea rather than being overpowered with mint. As I say, this is closer to what I recall of the authentic blend that got me started on Moroccan tea.<br /><br />Second, I like the quality of the tea. I'm not sure what style of green tea they use, but I like this quite a bit. It's mild without a bitterness.<br /><br />Third, I love that they use spearmint rather than peppermint. I have no idea why so many blends use peppermint. Spearmint is not only more true to the style, but it's also much less overpowering and is a nice balance to the tea rather than drowning the tea.<br /><br />Fourth, I like the value here. This is a really fair price for 16oz of tea, and the fact that it's also organically grown in a huge bonus!

review/summary: Read on for the story here.  Lubeck Niederegger is the best highest quality of Marzipan! The Connoisseur's Marzipan!
review/text: Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-six generous bars of delectable dark chocolate with an orange flavored marzipan. The combination of great chocolate, almonds, and citrus is truly terrific. Have a quality piece of chocolate and actually eat less 'cause it is so satisfying.  Gave these bars as little gifts. Stick it in your backpack for an energy treat while out hiking.<br /><br />Lubeck Niederegger is the best, highest quality of Marzipan! This is a lovely gift-<br />highly appreciated. Keeps for months (keep it cool, OK in fridge).<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is like no other! Search them on the web for the full story. Highest quality Marzipan originated in Turkey, under the Ottomans. When the Turks came up through Europe, all the way to the Gates of Vienna, they brought Marzipan with them. -The Croissant bread (Turkish Crescent)  was developed to warn people the Turks were coming-<br /><br />The Germans, Swiss, Austrians, and Swedes are most renowned for Marzipan in Europe. Check out the Niederegger site -a nice site! Great site-learn about Marzipan quickly-nice story.<br /><br />Niederegger Marzipan is made with more Almonds, less sugar, filler than others. Simply, ground almonds, rose water, sugar makes the best Marzipan.  No filler, no almond extracts.<br />Lower quality Marzipans need that since they have a lower concentration of almonds.<br /><br />With WWII, the Cafe Niederegger in Lubeck, Germany (East Germany for many years) was destroyed: 1942 "The caf&eacute; was destroyed by bombing and the company's archives went up in flames."<br /><br />Thankfully, the cafe  was rebuilt & this fine Marzipan is still available. With German reunification, it is easier to get this great marzipan again. Highly recommended!

review/summary: Noob's View to Marzipan
review/text: I have always been intrigued by Marzipan - yet I had never tried it.  I guess the sound of the name draws me in.  So this order began my adventure into Marzipan.  To be fair, my Wife would probably give this a 4 or 5 Star rating.<br /><br />I have given this 3 stars, not due to poor quality, no poor taste - but rather being disappointed in reality meets expectations.  I am sure many will cry foul, that I hold this product to blame, but I think-it out this way: Reviews say this is the best Marzipan, Niederegger  will give me the ultimate Marzipan experience, experience falls short of expectations, therefore a 3 star rating.<br /><br />So why did this fall short, in my opinion 3 areas fell short: 1) Texture, 2) Flavor, 3) Sweetness.<br /><br />First to texture, I anticipated smoother and lighter than what Niederegger delivered.  This is a very rich, dense treat.  Subtle, yet kind of overbearing.<br /><br />Second is flavor - I anticipated a lighter, less earthy flavor.  While I really enjoy almonds, but this is almost almond overkill.  Its a very earthy flavor, subtle like almonds, but undeniable present.<br /><br />Third is sweetness - I was really expecting a sweeter treat, even with Dark Chocolate being the coating.  In my opinion, there is only a hint of sweetness, not a robust sweetness.  When I reach for sweets, I want sweet.  I did not want/expect an overly sweet experience like a candy bar, but maybe subtle fullness of a good peanut butter cookie.<br /><br />And just to really make a fan of Niederegger mad, I do enjoy these, but I just can't rate it any higher.

review/text: We have found this product to be very tasty and very versatile.  I saw in a recipe for latkes by Mario Batali that he added some matzo meal to his recipe. I ordered some whole grain MM by Manischewitz from Amazon (where else?) and tried it.  We loved them!  I started adding it to the many hot cereals we eat during the winter months, millet, amaranth, quinoa, whole corn grits, oatmeal and so on... and cookies and flatbreads... we really like the nutty, wholesome taste of the whole wheat.  Of course, if you are a refined, defibered, processed food person (why?), then just get the other version!<br />To your health!

review/summary: Whole wheat
review/text: This product is good, but has far fewer uses than the non-whole wheat version.  The problem with whole wheat is that it has a rich, almost pre-baked dark feel to it.  This is fine in rich, crusty bread, but in matzoh pancakes or soup balls, you want a more neutral non-flavored matzoh, which then highlights the media(apple sauce and syrup, or chicken soup, resp.) and not the whole wheat "nuttiness".

review/summary: Great Mid-Value Treat for Your Dog!
review/text: I've been feeding Soft and Chewy Buddy Biscuits to my three dogs for years. They're great because they break apart easily, so you can give them whole or break them down for training or to fit appropriately in interactive toys.<br /><br />Some dogs may not be thrilled about the lamb flavor as much as other Buddy Biscuit flavors (our three dogs seem to favor the Beef and Grilled Chicken), but I've never seen a happy dog turn them down.<br /><br />I note these as a "mid-value" treat because I've tried using these as a high value treat for a fearful dog, and they just didn't cut it. It's not surprising, as high value usually needs to be something like cheese or meat, but I did want to make the distinction.<br /><br />That doesn't mean they wouldn't be high value for your dog (every dog is different), but they do not work for us.<br /><br />They are not "mid-value" as in quality. They are high quality treats, with good ingredients, made in the United States. We currently buy every flavor we can on Amazon through Subscribe and Save, if that says anything about how we feel about them.<br /><br />Out of all of the flavors, our dogs like the Sweet Potato and Peanut Butter flavors the least. What does this mean? If you put out one biscuit of each, they'd choose these last. They still eat them happily.

review/summary: The Dogs Say YUMMY (aka: WOOF WOOF)
review/text: I do have 7 dogs so buy in bulk since handing out treats to so many I like to give them the same treats. But some of my 7 dogs (kids) are older and have tooth issues and can't chew on the harder treats such as the Chicken Tenders, which aren't tender but yummy to chew on. So for the soft pallets and hurting teeth this treat is soft enough for them to enjoy. This is my GO-TO treat which ensures all my kids have a good healthy treat! WOOF WOOF - YES!

review/text: I love this Licorice Bridge Mix. I remember my Nana always having some of this around when I was little. I bought it to put in some Apothecary jars for decoration. I love the bright colors mixed with the pretty pastels and the black licorice jelly beans. My favorite pieces by far are the multi-colored sprinkle covered gum drops which I wish there were more of in the mix. Because there aren't very many of the gum drops, I place them around strategically to show them off better. This bridge mix also tastes good too. The little pastel pieces remind me Good and Plenty. Yum!

The candies are of high quality, and were shipping to me in a timely manner during the holidays, and arrived before Christmas.

review/summary: A bit different, and wonderful
review/text: These peppercorns are a beautiful rosy color, which clues you in before you even get a chance to open the package that they're not the peppercorns you've known all your life. When you do pull open the bag and inhale their aroma, you'll find they combine the scent of pepper with a wonderful fruity, almost floral overtone. It's hard to describe, and even harder to imagine until you've experienced it. The lovely part is that the flavor profile doesn't diminish in use; when I ground and steeped these Sichuan peppercorns for a dark chocolate mousse (grind finely, and steep in the heavy cream for 30 minutes before straining the cream into the chocolate) their vibrant peppery fruit/floral scent was the top note of the mousse. It was a memorably different flavor. Now I'm looking for ways to add them to more dishes, to see what new nuances they can impart to old favorites.

I may be using these in the nursing home.<br /><br />My package arrived quickly, and was well packed. Looking at a previous review that insisted the package was lightweight, I weighed my bag of peppercorns upon arrival and it was exactly 8 oz. So I wouldn't be too concerned about a lightweight package.<br /><br />These peppercorns are beautiful, with a lively flavor and plump appearance. They are not shriveled like many peppercorns. I used them to make Kung Pao chicken and ZING they about burned my face off! But in a good way. Such peppery, fresh, citrusy hot flavor. Love them!!!<br /><br />If I ever run out (ever)...I will reorder from this seller!

There are a few black centers still but it's much better quality than the local Asian grocery at roughly the same price.  As someone else noted 8oz. is a LOT of pepper -- it may take a while to use all this up.

review/text: I thought this looked like a pretty good deal for 10 ice cream sandwiches.  One review talked about what a good deal it was, and I agreed, so I tried.  I found that I paid $11 for ONE single ice cream sandwich.  I am in the process of filing complaints and trying to get this fixed, but considering that another person posted with the same problem, I am suspecting that this is something of a scam.  If it isn't a scam, then they have poor quality control for their shipping.<br /><br />The single package I got looked good and was foil wrapped.  Unfortunately I can't eat it until the dispute is resolved.  Oh, and it took nearly 3 weeks to get that one packages sent via extremely thin packaging that left the ice cream smashed to bits by the postal service.  We'll see how the resolution goes, but I don't expect to order from this seller again.

review/text: If you like a bold, rich coffee, this one is for you. I have a Senseo coffee maker, and Baronet is my brand of choice. The pods are a little large for the single pod holder, and they are a tight fit, but they work well. The Sumatra Dark Roast is very bold in flavor, with hints of cocoa, a slight smokiness, and a creamy finish that lingers on the tongue - one of my favorites! This is excellent coffee.

review/summary: A Good Brew
review/text: These pods were bought for my Senseo, and couldn't ask for a better tasting brew. I also like the fact that they are individually wrapped! Word of caution though, these pods are 10 grams, which fit really tight in my machine-it almost feels like I am going to break the Senseo when trying to close the lid, and I wasn't able to use two pods using the double pod holder. Baronet does sell an 8 gram pod so that is the on that actually fits the Senseo a lot better, and not so much this 10 gram pod. Amazon should mark the pod size plainly in the product description, I will say that the 8 gram pods are packaged much like Senseo's, just loose in a bag and not individually wrapped. Happy Sipping!

review/summary: Sumatra Smooth
review/text: I would give this blend 5 stars for the smooth start but it does have a little bitterness in the after taste.  Some people love this in a coffee so I would not say it hinders the quality of the Baronet Coffees.  They are individually packaged for freshness and that is a real plus.  I do enjoy the richness and I can get an 8oz cup out of just one pod.

review/summary: Baronet Coffee
review/text: I tried to replace my Mellita pods with the Baronet coffee pods.  It tastes better but the outer covering is too dense.  When the highpressure water tries to filter thru the coffee basket, it sometimes spews out the front of the coffe pot. The water could burn someone.

review/summary: no consistency between products
review/text: These are 'senseo' style coffee pods.  I ordered these for a different flavor in my 'ESE' pod machine.  I had previously been using the Baronet Espresso roast pods, which are 'ESE' pods.  Packaging and description on both products simply state 'coffee pods'.  It would be a better benefit to consumers if manufacturers could at least properly identify their own product so we can make informed purchasing decisions.<br /><br />If you need senseo style coffee pods, these might be a choice for you.  If you need ESE coffee pods, stay away.<br /><br />'Senso' style coffee pods are large, loosely filled, and about 70mm in diameter.<br />'ESE' style coffee pods are smaller, tightly packed, and about 52-55mm in diameter.

review/summary: Bitter and Horrible
review/text: I'm not picky about coffee at all. I make lattes with my Senseo for gods sake! The price was good, so I bought this one and the french vanilla. Both were bad, but this one was the worst. It was bitter and just plain bad tasting. This is the first brand that I have tried in which the coffee has been of poor quality across the board. I've been trying to finish this off, but I think I might just throw the rest away. It's THAT bad.<br /><br />I note that the 5* review was supposed to be for Wolfgang Puck's Sumatra. Looks like that guy mistakenly posted it here.

review/summary: Purse-friendly limes
review/text: I don't drink coffee, so my source of caffeine is diet cola, which often leaves an aftertaste.  These packets give you a great lime taste, kill the cola aftertaste, and can be conveniently carried around in a purse.  They're also great if you have concerns about the cleanliness of cut restaurant limes. Getting 500 at once is a lot, but I can't seem to find the smaller packs in stores anymore, and my friends are thrilled I have plenty to share.  Even with shipping, the 500 pack is a good deal, and the shipping was lightning fast.

review/summary: A GREAT Substitute
review/text: Of course, nothing can be a good as freshly squeezed lime juice, however...sometimes my fresh limes have...uh oh!..gotten old in the bowl or fridge; sometimes I just don't have any on hand. Whatever the reason, these True Lime and True Lemon packets are just the thing. They are not sweetened [the dextrose in the ingredients seems to cut the sour taste only slightly]. I have used these packets whenever I wanted lime juice...soups, bottled water, Bloody Mary, guacamole, etc. Even in Metro Atlanta, this product is difficult to find in the grocery. Hooray for Amazon!

I don't like the taste of the minerals in tap water and some bottled water and I have no intention of spending 2 dollars a bottle for the 'pure' stuff.  This covers the taste perfectly.

review/summary: An excellent cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried every coffee and tea offered for the Tassimo system.  I have found the Maxwell House blends to be some of the better flavored coffees.  The French Roast is taughted as a "bold" blend.  It creates a nice rich dark flavor without going into being bitter.  If you are a Starbucks addict; you won't find the "earthy" taste in the MH-FR blend, if you're wondering how it compares.  The MH-FR is one of the few Tassimo blends I consistently order.  It makes a very good cup of coffee for any time of the day.

review/summary: Best Combination of Flavor and Value
review/text: I've had a Tassimo machine (not the same one) for nearly four years now, and have tried most if not all of the discs available through Amazon.  While I haven't been thrilled with any of the other Maxwell House discs particularly (I like a strong cup of coffee, but there are a wide variety of preferences on this issue), I've been very, very pleased with the French Roast.  It gives a strong but smooth brew and you can't beat the price--at the time I'm writing this you can get 2 packs of 16 discs of the MH French Roast for under $14, compared to 2 packs of 12 discs for more than $20 for the Starbucks blends.  I still buy Starbucks, particularly the Africa Kitamu, and Seattle's Best, particularly Henry's Blend, because I like variety in my cup of Joe, but MH's French Roast is great choice, especially if you have multiple coffee drinkers in the house and need to keep plenty of discs on hand while still keeping within your food budget!

review/summary: Tassimo Maxwell House French roast
review/text: My wife and I were a bit freaked when Starbucks announced it was no longer being sold in Tassimo (well, you can still buy them at historic prices as their supply must be near zero).  But Maxwell House French Roast more than amply fills the void where Starbuck's House blend used to occupy.  Good, rich, robust, strong cup of coffee!  And it's only costing us about .30/cup compared to Starbuck's original price of about .75/cup

review/text: I was looking for a rich, dark coffee for my morning mug.  But I didn't have a ton of money to spend.  The Maxwell House Cafe Collection French Roast was being offered at a great price, but I didn't expect too much from the old supermarket Maxwell House brand.  I was pleasantly surprised, however,  at the depth of flavor and great aroma of the T-discs.  They're better than any K-cups I've tried for my Keurig machine.  I highly recommend both the Tassimo machine & the Maxwell House Cafe Collection French Roast Coffee.

review/summary: Great way to wake up!
review/text: First off I don't normally write reviews unless I am dissatisfied with a product. I was so impressed with the Maxwell House Dark Roast that I had to chime in. I used to drink Starbucks ll the time using a regular coffee brewer, but after wasting so much I decided to get a Tassimo brewer. While it was a great deal ($30 for the brewer), it has been very difficult to find T-disks in grocery stores. I am sure if you are a Tassimo lover you have had the same frustrations.<br /><br />Well back on point, this coffee is my new favorite. It has a nice bold taste with NO aftertaste. Goes down smooth and has a nice rich, almost smoky flavor. I always add one sweet-n-low to my coffee. No milk or creamer. Again, can't say enough about this awesome product!

review/text: I bought a Tassimo coffee maker over the Keurig because I wanted brewed coffee through ground and not liquid syrup. I have never been a huge coffee fan but have started drinking it for the health benefits of the antioxidants. (1 cup no milk products used has more than a cup of blueberries) Of all the discs i have bought so far this one is by far my favorite. The Maxwell house options also have some of the best pricing of the available T discs as well.

review/summary: Bold coffee
review/text: So far this is the only Tassimo t-disc coffee product in the Bold category that I have been able to find.  I am still disappointed that Starbuck's Cafe Verona is no longer available.  There is suppose to be a Gevalia Tassimo bold coffee becoming available the middle of OCT through Amazon.com.  I have this product on pre-order and I am hopeful  we may soon have other choices.  So in the mean time by using less water per disc this has been a drinkable and flavorful substitute.  One of the problems with the available products is that there is not enough coffee per disc.  Starbucks had the best size with more coffee per unit.

I have been using their products along with T-disks by Maxwell House, Starbucks, Gervalia, Twinings Tea etc. etc. for over 5 years.  I have never had an issue with freshness, or quality in the Maxwell house (or other brands).  The products are simple to use and perfect for a quick cup of coffee.  This particular order for the "French Roast" (dark) was very good in flavor, dark but not overly bitter.  Overall, a great product.
