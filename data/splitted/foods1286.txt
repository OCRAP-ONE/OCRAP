review/summary: Poodle loves these treats
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 1:34 Mins<br /><br /></span>I bought these because they are low calorie, so I can stuff a bunch into Poodle's treat puzzles without feeling guilty. He LOVES the cheese flavor (the only one I have tried so far). He stays quiet when being groomed if given liberal amounts of them.  Great amount in the bag for the price too. According to their page on FaceBook, they are only 3 calories per treat. In the video you can see Poodle getting treats out of a bottle, it is a mix of kibble, some <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SQK3QW">Costless Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets, 32-Ounce</a> and Charlee Bear Cheese and Egg treats. You can see that the treats fit whole into the opening of the bottle, so they are not all that big. This is a fun way to get him some mental exercise and I watch him so he doesn't chew up the bottle.

review/summary: Charlee Bear
review/text: These are the perfect size for training but they are not to be confused with actual "treats." These are more like you-did-a-good-job-buddy tokens. My dog will eat them happily, but he does not get excited about them, and my dog gets very excited by most anything edible (and some things non-edible).<br /><br />I'd get them again, but only if the price was much lower than it currently is ($8.60). I think $3-4 would be a reasonable price for what you get.

review/text: We have three dogs and they all love Charlee Bear dog treats.  We cannot get them in our area so we have to order them.  They are worth it as our puppies eat them like candy.  We have not been able to get our dogs to eat other treats and have wasted a lot of money buying and trying others.  No more. We will be buying more of these.

review/text: I have an elderly pomeranian and she loves these treats.  I first bought them a few years ago and she's never tired of them.  She has no problem chewing them even though she only has a couple teeth.  Also, her stomach is very sensitive and she can eat a handful of these with no problem.  Great for sneaking into her carrier on flights.

review/text: Our miniature poodle loves these. I used to get these at the local pet shop in this flavor and two other flavors and my dog loves all of them. They are the perfect size for her, easy to eat, and it is apparent she loves the flavors. They seem to be sort of a cracker consistency. They are low calorie and appear to be a healthy snack. And of course, they are less expensive if you get them here at Amazon.

review/summary: First Treat Our New Dog Would Eat
review/text: We recently adopted a rescued dog.  She would not touch the Little-Jacs or Iams dog bones.  After a few days our shipment of Charlee Bear Cheese/Egg treats arrived and she loved them right off.  I love them too for being made in USA and not full of chemicals or dyes.  Now she will eat those other treats.  We ended up with so many treats that I repackaged some of them and stashed them in the freezer for future use.

review/summary: Both my dogs refuse to eat these.
review/text: Normally, I wouldn't post a review against a product like this that is much healthier than the average dog treat, but since all of the other reviewers have said their dogs love these treats, I thought I'd mention that both of my dogs refused to eat these. I agree with others that they are low calorie and small, so they're better than a lot of other dog snacks, especially if you plan to give multiple treats out. The bag is also large and for the price, it's a really good value. Unfortunately, whether it be taste or texture, both my dogs spit them out and walked away or refused them outright after I offered them.

review/summary: Excellent training treat - soft, tasty, low calorie
review/text: We also have some moist minatures (which are bigger), but I have found that these Cheese/Egg dog treats are great training treats. They are soft, tasty, crunchy, and low calorie. The product states that each treat is about 3 calories. Some sessions require more treats, and I definitely do not want my Labrador puppy to fatten up too much. With these treats, it's okay to feed your dog more, if need  be.<br /><br />The amount is also generous and plentiful. For about 16 ounces (1 pound), the treats are of good value.<br /><br />Have your dog try these treats! They'll love them.

review/summary: 2 out of 3 dogs recommend...
review/text: 2 out of 3 dogs recommend Charlee Bears!  (Actually-- lets go 4 of 5, because our first two dogs that both lived to ripe old ages but passed a few years ago also loved Charlee Bears.)<br /><br />They are great training treats because they are small, solid (so they don't turn to crumbs in a pocket), and not stinky.  (At least to the human nose.  I keep a ziplock of them in my coat pocket at all times and no one knows it but me and my dogs!)<br /><br />We also have a kong they fit nicely into without breaking.<br /><br />Good price at Amazon, too!<br /><br />And I should also mention that the third of our current canine buddies is weird.  We might not want to take her opinion into consideration... She's afraid of balloons, for example.  Ever seen a coonhound afraid of BALLOONS??  No clue why she won't eat these... but she won't eat a lot of stuff the other 2 dogs think are heavenly, but she will stick her head into a litter box.  Eeech.  She will actually take these treats that all dogs seem to love, and then spit them out... and then one of the other two dogs will grab it and gobble it up...  Such a pity... How are you supposed to train a dog that doesn't care if she gets the cookie?  Perhaps I should carry litter in my pocket, too.

review/text: My dog loves these. She knows the name "Charlee Bear" when I say it, and loves chasing around the living room for them. Since they're small, she can have several, and hunt them down. This is one of her favorite flavors (although she's never refused ANY of them).  My dog will be most displeased if your dog is denied one of her favorite goodies. :)

review/text: What was I THINKING???  Of course these cause stinky gas.  Don't you have that when you eat deviled eggs on the holidays?  I love the Charlee Bear Dog treat line, however, I have to get rid of my 16 ounces of treats because my yellow lab is continually passing gas when I have given him these.  Labs are notorious for stomach issues, so it could be that, but I won't get this flavor again.

review/summary: Training treats
review/text: I have a 3 month old puppy who will eat literally anything and a very picky 12 year old dog, both love these treats. I have the cheese/egg flavor. I use them as training treats for the puppy and training/whenever treats for my dog who could stand to gain a few pounds. I like them because they can be carried in my pocket without leaving residue, and at less than $6 they cost less than other similar treats (Zuke's mini bakes are the others that I currently have). Just an FYI, they are sort of like crackers, you can't break them apart easily. They're not big so it's not necessary, but I tried because I go through a lot with my puppy and it crumbled.

review/summary: Great Low Calorie Training Treats
review/text: Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors.

So I was happy to see that Amazon now carries three different flavors, and my small dogs (Cav. King Charles Spaniels) love them all. I was surprised at how much they loved the turkey liver and cranberry flavor.  These treats are only 3 calories each and do not have an odor. Each one is about the size of a "chubby" dime.  I don't feel guilty about treating my dogs with Charlee Bear treats several times a day.

The package states it is 100 % natural, has more electrolytes than leading sports drinks with 15 times the potassium, and has more potassium than 2 bananas.<br /><br />So--- it is good, refreshing, healthy, easily packable, and easily openable. (It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on "potassium" before the heat gets here.

review/summary: Good if you like acai, great if you like Acai & Coco H2O!!
review/text: This drink is not like the Vita Coco plain beverage, it has a purpleish color from the addition of Acai & Pomegranate.. So if you are expecting the same taste as regular cocowater, but with a hint of Acai & Pomegranate dont buy this as it is distinctively different than the normal Coco Water.  I find the taste very refreshing & as someone that drinks other Acai beverages I can honestly say that the taste is pure & fresh as having Ground up Acai berries added to Coco Water.. The antioxidants in this drink coupled with the electrolytes provide a much needed pick me up whenever you may feel slightly dehydrated.  The Pomegranate taste is more subtle than the Acai almost luring you to find it on your taste buds, which is fine by me because it makes this drink more drinkable than if the more sour fruit was prominent.. I think the people that gave this a poor rating were expecting a more sugary sweet taste, this is exactly like Drinking the Sambozan Acai drink with coco water.. Exactly what it advertises. I really enjoy it & feel sort of revived after I drink it.

review/summary: Great product but horrible after taste
review/text: I love vita coco and this drink is great but with horrible after taste. This flavor has more potassium( 21% vs 19%) than the pineapple flavor so this was the main reason for me trying this. The flavor is great while drinking but the after taste is horrible. Its mostly acai flavor after taste and Im not a big fan of acai. The acai basically over powers the pomergranate and coconut but its still a refeshing flavor. Overall I would not by this flavor again if I had the chance. Hopefully the tangerine one comes back so I can give that one a try.

review/text: So I made a mistake of buying the whole case before trying the flavor and it bit me in my behind. I love Viva Coco plain and with Pineapple and Mango mixes, but mostly I use it as a work-out drink. This particular one is so sweet that I can barely stomack it. It also doesn't have much flavor or acidity which makes the sweetness even worse. After I'm done with this case, it's back to plan coconut water for me.

How can a boxed drink that you use to take along with you not come with straws?  Does VITA CoCo expect their consumers to drink this directly from the top of the box - very inconvenient.

review/text: I bought all t he flavors for the Vita Coco Coconut Water. This one, Acai Pomegranate probably has the weirdest taste, that is if you never tried Acai before. I have, so i was ok with the flavor. But as far as what its offers for you, it is a good product.<br /><br />I was surprised though, that with all the flavors, there is very little difference in nutritional facts. So, if you want better flavor, try the regular coconat water or the peach & mango.<br /><br />The delivery service setup by amazon though, is great.

I've had the original, unflavored Vita Coco (like it better than original, unflavored O.N.E. and very tolerable for unflavored) and Tangerine Vita Coco (superb!).  This is a HUGE disappointment in comparison.  I used to love the Acai coconut water offered by Hudson Bay, but I can no longer find it.  That was my favorite drink ever!  I'm not sure if it is the pomegranate that makes it taste rather lousy, but I was wholly disappointed.  There is a pleasant fruity aftertaste, but it is ever so slight and nearly undetectable.  I'll pass on another purchase of this again.

I had others try it to see if it was just me, and they didn't like it either, and they love coconut water. I recently started drinking coconut water. I tried the O.N.E. brand with pink guava, pineapple, and mango and it tasted great. I barely tasted the coconut which is good because I'm not a big fan of coconut, but the reason why I am drinking it, is because I heard it is really good for you. I tried the VitaCoco with tropical fruit and it doesn't taste bad at all. I'm drinking it now. I am staying away from this flavor. Yikes!!

I'll stick with coconut water and pomegranate as two separate drinks, not mixed into one weird and indistinguishable flavor. Buy one at the store before committing to a 12 pack.

I now drink a box every morning with my breakfast, replacing my glass of orange juice.  Trying to go back to orange juice is now difficult because you realize how sugary it is in comparison to the coconut water.  It makes taking my vitamins easy and I miss it when I'm traveling and can't get my hands on it.  The flavors are subtle and I like the color.

review/summary: Delicious Sweetener for Tea and Baking
review/text: Organic Sucanat is many levels above regular white granulated sugar. This sugar takes baking and tea drinking to new levels of pleasure.<br /><br />When holding this sugar in the palm of your hand, you will notice the irregularity of the crystals and the  "dark brown sugar" color. This does have a flavor that is reminiscent of brown sugar and yet the texture is much more natural and the crystals take longer to melt on your tongue.<br /><br />Recently I've been discovering a variety of more natural sweeteners. This on is perfect for tea because it not only adds sweetness; it adds a caramel flavor to teas in which you use milk. There is a purity in the flavor and you feel better because you are supporting organic farms and keeping your body healthy.<br /><br />This is a one-for-one replacement for refined white or brown sugar.<br /><br />Sucanat is made from 100% certified organic sugar cane. The sugar cane is "green cut." This means the fields are not burned and the leaves and tops of the cane plant are left in the field. The sugar is minimally processed and once the sugar cane is harvested it is pressed to squeeze out all the cane juice. This juice is then clarified, filtered and evaporated. This helps to remove excess water. The syrup is then crystallized and a sugar with a molasses flavor is produced. There are also vitamins, minerals and trace elements from the sugar cane plant. One teaspoon of Sucanat contains 10mg of Potassium and 6mg of Calcium.<br /><br />If you are still using white sugar, try Sucanat. It might surprise you with added flavor, goodness and purity. I find the flavor to be superior to refined white sugar. This sugar will add a touch of caramel flavor to all your baking.<br /><br />If you are looking for an even deeper flavor for chocolate recipes, try Muscovado sugar. It has a rich flavor that can't be matched by any regular brown sugar you would find in your grocery store. With Muscovado and Sucanat, you can take your baking to the next level.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/text: They don't taste as great and aren't as crisp, but it's worth the trade off knowing these wheat thins are packed full of multigrains. I've already gotten used to the change in taste/texture and i'm very satisfied. I ordered 6 boxes :D.

review/summary: I love regular Wheat Thins but NOT this kind
review/text: I love regular Wheat Thins so I wanted to try this Multi-Grain kind. Bad idea. These have no taste - it's like eating thin pieces of cardboard. Yes it's healthier than the original but so what. I really can't stand the taste of these and had to give them away to friends - I'm not sure if they ate it. I won't be buying this variety of Wheat Thins again.

review/summary: Pretty good for a lighter roast
review/text: I bought the whole bean variety and ground it right before brewing in my (admittedly cheap, underwhelming) drip coffee maker on the "strong" setting.  I'm an avid fan of dark roasts, and this is not dark.  The beans were dry and brittle out of the package with no oils whatsoever on them and left no residue on the inside of my blade grinder.  The acidity seems pretty high, and the flavor falls between a light breakfast blend and a traditional colombian roast.  don't let this scare you off if you like the darker roasts, though.  It has an earthy,(though not "dark roast" intense), flavor that is usually lacking to me in lighter roasts.  Overall, I'm pretty impressed at the moment and plan on running some through my french press in the morning, hopefully bringing out some of the nuances.

review/text: My husband had seen someone in work with this tea. It looked different so we decided to look online and see if we could find it. We ordered it, where else but on Amazon, and love it! It has such a distinctive taste. It's not too strong but it's also not as weak as other teas we've tried.  Since there were 6 tins we shared it with our families who also love it. We've already gotten our instructions for what to get them for Christmas. WE LOVE THIS TEA!!

review/text: I'm not sure how these treats can be advertised as made in America when the back of the bag very clearly says (albeit in tiny print) "MADE IN CHINA". I wouldn't mind this so much except that to date 360 dogs have died from consuming pet jerky made in China. It's mostly chicken jerky, but duck was added to the list. Canyon Creek was one had one of the highest incidents of death, and was listed as a product to avoid. So now I'm shopping for duck jerky made in the US, and here is this product falsely listed. BEWARE! Scientists and the FDA haven't nailed down what's causing these deaths. Who knows what the underlying problem really is, but I couldn't live with the guilt. No more foreign pet jerky for my sweet canine friend! I have added one site about this problem (there are many more): [...]

review/summary: Not a magic bullet, but I believe it helps
review/text: I've been trying to lose weight for months but have only taken this for a couple of weeks.  Over about the last 4 months I've lost 16-17 pounds, but I had plateaued.  Since I started taking this product about 2 weeks ago I've lost about 4 pounds.  I am watching my diet and working out.  I had been working out regularly for a long time already, and watching my diet (admittedly on and off) for quite a while before this 2 week period.  So while this product alone I don't think has caused weight loss for me, I think it has given me a boost and helped get me off a plateau.  No stimulants, the B vitamins are good, and glucomannan fiber helps with both fullness and (ahem...) certain functions.  :)  I like it.  I will keep taking it.

A 16-ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months, or perhaps years.  It is supposed to last one year, but it can  easily last 5-10 years, according to a number of sources.  It is to be stored in a cool dry place.<br /><br />SAF Instant Yeast is a powerful and fast-acting yeast.  It can be added to dry ingredients directly.  It is  twice  as active as regular compressed yeast.

review/summary: A Reliable Product - Makes delicious breads...
review/text: If you love using your bread machine and want a reliable yeast that does not need to be proofed (can't remember the last time I did that), then this yeast will make your life much easier. While this is not a rapid yeast, the bread does seem to rise more quickly than with packets of yeast from the grocery store. This saves time and gives you an empowered feeling instead of the "Is this going to rise or not?" feeling.<br /><br />The yeast can be stored in the refrigerator or freezer and is very convenient to use. Unlike the yeast cakes, you don't have to worry about mixing it with water or milk. You just measure it into the bread machine.<br /><br />Here is the recipe I love making for Focaccia bread. It turns out wonderful and you can start it in the bread machine or make it by hand. We serve this in slices or squares topped with butter and fresh rosemary or an herbed cream cheese. Perfect with homemade soup in the winter.<br /><br />Focaccia for the Bread Machine (start in machine, finish by hand)<br /><br />2 1/2 cups water<br />2 tablespoons Saf instant yeast<br />2 tablespoons sugar<br />2 teaspoons freshly crushed sea salt<br />2 tablespoons olive oil<br />6 cups all-purpose flour (the Baker's Catalogue sells an amazing flour)<br /><br />Measure the water, yeast, sugar, salt, olive oil and flour into the bread pan. Program for white bread, dough cycle and large loaf. After the dough has been kneaded, you can put it in a large stainless bowl and cover the dough with a damp cloth. I normally forget it is in there and catch it just before it is about to rise over the top of the pan, so it still works, either way. You could also use half the ingredients for just one loaf if you want to let it rise in the bread machine<br />pan.<br /><br />Let it rise until double in a warm place. My secret it to turn the oven on and then almost immediately off (just leave it on until you feel some heat on your hand) and this seems to create a "just warm enough" environment for bread to rise. Punch down and divide into thirds. Roll out two squares and one elongated loaf. This works well on the regular size cookie sheets. If you have a larger cookie sheet, you can roll the dough into two 8-inch squares.<br /><br />Make deep indents with the end of the rolling pin handle at regular intervals. Then brush with olive oil. Let the bread rise until almost doubled.<br /><br />Either sprinkle with sea salt or sprinkle with dried or fresh rosemary and sea salt. You can also top the dough with tomato slices, onion slices and sliced and pitted Kalamata olives before baking.<br /><br />Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes.<br /><br />After the bread cools, it will slice easily and it freezes very well. I normally slice two loaves and cut one into squares for sandwiches.<br /><br />To make an Herbed Cream Cheese: Blend together 1/3 cup butter, 1 (8-ounce) package cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dried parsley, 2 teaspoons dried rosemary and 1 teaspoon dried thyme.<br /><br />The idea for this bread came to me after visiting a sandwich shop at a garden center in Seattle. After arriving home from visiting my grandmother, I knew I had to try to make the cream cheese and the bread because they were perfect to serve with homemade soup.<br /><br />This bread has a lot of possibilities so you can vary the toppings to suit the types of soups you are serving.<br /><br />The Instant yeast always works and with a bread machine, you end up feeling like a professional baker. The results are sure to impress. The bread always has a "fresh from the bakery" taste unlike the taste of breads made with packets of yeast.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

review/summary: Bread-Machine Bargain
review/text: I run my automatic bread maker at least twice a week, so I go through a lot of yeast.  I measure out my own dry bread mix according to a couple of recipies and store it in the freezer.  I mix five batches at a time.  To start the machine on any given day, I just reach for a single-batch container.<br /><br />When I am putting up the dry mix, I am committed.  I have to be sure I have enough of each ingredient to start with.  Having a pound of Saf Instant Yeast on hand saves me from running to the store for the little 4 oz. jars or fiddling with teensy-weensy foil packets, which are just the wrong size. I store the instant yeast in the freezer, too, by the way.<br /><br />I don't worry about ingredients much.  I add a tablespoon of vital gluten to each batch to make up for any deficiency in the flour.  However, there is one ingredient that has to be perfect:  the yeast.  If it "don't go," I've wasted the first batch.  Then I have to get good yeast and go back and add it to unused batches.  Been there; done that!<br /><br />I've bought three one-pound bricks of Saf Instant Yeast in the last couple of years.  They have given consistent results from first to last.  The days when I ruined loaf after loaf trying to use yeast from the supermarket are over.

review/summary: Favorite Yeast
review/text: This is my absolute favorite yeast.  Someone (and for the life of me, I can't remember if it was Alton Brown or America's Test Kitchen) measured the packet yeasts and found them to be wildly inconsistent - significantly over or under the stated amount.  Maybe that explains some of my past issues with raised breads, but since I started using the SAF yeast, it's been absolutely perfect.  Great in a bread machine, no proofing required, and I always get a consistent rise.  I've used the bulk Red Star Active Rise as well and didn't like it at all - I just didn't feel it was as consistent.  The SAF never makes me wonder if it's getting old or losing it's potency - it just works.<br /><br />I tend to bake in phases, so I also appreciate the shelf (or in my case, freezer) life.  I usually keep a small container in the refrigerator and the rest bagged up in the deep freeze.  I even found some at the back of the freezer that was about three years old and it still worked perfectly.  I have *never* had this stuff fail on me.<br /><br />Since I'm not that serious of a baker, I can't compare Instant Yeast to Cake Yeast or other exotics, but for the bread machine and everyday bakers, this is the best I've found.

review/summary: Died 6 weeks after purchasing
review/text: I have used SAF yeast before-had it in the freezer for over 3 years without a problem. I ordered this yeast 6 weeks ago from Amazon, put it in an airtight container, and refrigerated it. It worked great-was using it to make a loaf of bread one at a time (not a new recipe) over past 12 hours and none of them rose. I decided to proof the yeast and it was dead. I then checked the packaging which I had saved from the original container and there was NO date next to "Best if used by". Now, I am going to a Christmas party to which I was going to bring homemade bread, and its too late to make a fourth loaf. Please, check for dates when receiving this product. I am very disappointed.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003Z7VYXW">Saf Instant Yeast, 1-Pound Pouches (Pack of 4)</a>

review/text: You can keep this in the freezer, so it stays fresh a long time, and is much cheaper than the little packets from the grocery.<br /><br />I use it without thawing.  I don't know if that would work with traditional bread recipes, might need a slightly longer first rise.<br /><br />But I use a recipe for "no knead" bread that requires a 20-24 hour rise after the initial mixing of dough and before baking.  I mix my dough after dinner one night and cook it for dinner the second night.  With that long a rise, I can't tell the difference between starting with frozen yeast versus fresh yeast.<br /><br />So this is very handy for me since I just measure out the frozen yeast and at a significant savings over individual packets from the grocery.

review/summary: Great Product! Great Bargain!
review/text: I have been baking for more than 30 years. I have always bought yeast by the jar (never packets). I bought this brand for the first time several weeks ago. I have tested it out with many of my usual recipes and found that it is far superior. Everyone of my tests using this yeast have produced a better rising dough. The finished products are outstanding. I changed nothing in my recipes except the yeast. I will never go back to the old brand.<br /><br />Yes, this is a lot of yeast if you don't bake often enough. But yeast keeps a long time in the freezer. As another reviewer stated, keep some in the fridge and stash the rest in the freezer until needed.

review/summary: First time
review/text: This was my first time using instant yeast, and I loved it.  No need to activate the yeast, simply mix in with dry ingredients and it works every time.  I have made pizza, pitas, and mexican sweet breads so far and I have no complaints.  The yeast comes in an air tight pouch and I refrigerate it for longer use.  It is quite a large amount for an average home.  I am very happy with this product.

review/summary: Saf-Yeast Instant Yeast is the Gold Standard for Bakers!
review/text: I have used yeast from the grocery store in the past, and have seldom had problems. The only reason I purchased the 16 ounce package of Saf-Yeast was the convenience of having a larger package. Little did I know that this yeast just works better! I get more consistent results and better rising with this yeast. I have been baking bread using the AB5 method, but using a sourdough starter and just a bit of yeast. With Saf-Yeast I have been able to cut back from 3 tablespoons of yeast to only 1/2 teaspoon and still get a great outcome. I just keep the yeast in the freezer in an airtight container and fully expect to use it up long before it looses its potency.
