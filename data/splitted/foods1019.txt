review/text: This is one of my favorite teas and I can drink it morning, noon or night-time -- with or without food.  It is caffeinated, so that may limit when others can drink it.  The taste is smooth and satisfying -- I drink it without sugar or milk.

review/text: My first experience with Twinings English Afternoon Tea....I am enjoying a cup or two almost daily at tea time - for me, that's between 4 and 5 p.m. I am an ongoing fan/user of Twinings English Breakfast Tea and bought a rather large amount at a fairly decent price.  This tea is a little more dear but still very pleasant.  I'm happy I decided to try it.

review/summary: Delicious tea!
review/text: Twinings English Afternoon Tea is a superb hot tea, delicious with milk and sugar, with a full, somewhat fruity flavor. Do not be afraid that this is a "watered-down" or weak version of the Breakfast Tea! It is every bit as full-bodied and hearty, just different, and perfect for a bit of variety. I love the English Breakfast Tea too. Try the Afternoon Tea. You won't be sorry.

review/summary: Hard to find tea at a great price
review/text: Twinings offers the best teas I know of. The English Afternoon blend has a medium body which is niether too strong or too weak. Very crisp and refreshing.<br />I tried this tea once as an experiment and loved it, but then was never able to find it again in my area. To my delight I came accross it again at Amazon, for a reasonable price, and imediatley ordered a subscription to have it delivered monthly.<br /><br />If you like Twinings Earl Grey (readily available most places) I'm sure you will enjoy English afternoon.

review/summary: Aptly named
review/text: A nice, medium-strength blended black tea.  (Not as strong as 'breakfast' teas.) As the name suggests, this IS good in the afternoon, perhaps with a slice of fruitcake or with a lunch of a turkey and provolone sandwich.<br /><br />I drink it black, either with or without food; however, since I do prefer it with food, I probably should try it with milk and sugar, as suggested in the product description.  I'm not an iced-tea drinker, so I can't speak to that.<br /><br />I'd never heard of this blend before seeing it on Amazon.  I can't always find Twinings, but this was a better unit price than when I do find Twinings of any kind. Aside from helping to preserve flavor, the individual-bag packaging also makes it handy for adding to a gift basket or tucking into a birthday card, especially since it's a somewhat unusual blend.<br /><br />I didn't give this the highest rating simply because there are other brands (Jackson's; F&M) and blends that I like better than this one, but this is still a very nice tea.

review/summary: Tidy Cats Breeze system..
review/text: I've had this for a few weeks, and I'm really happy with it.<br /><br />The hugest advantage to this system is the urine is separated from the 'litter' and odor is greatly reduced.  The litter consist of pellets similar in shape/size to the wood-based natural litters, but they are of a hard clay, which doesn't break down with moisture, and they keep their shape.  Thus, the urine drains straight down through a grid to the pad (in its own slide-out drawer), and the poo stays on top to be scooped away.<br /><br />The pee will not ferment with the characteristic stench, and you don't have to deal with clumping litter which doesn't really clump, and is just plain stinky and messy to scoop up.<br /><br />The proprietary 'pee' pads are kind of like a giant maxi pad, and absorb a lot of liquid.  Also, the bottom side of the pad is plastic, and the pad fits into the tray in a way that the plastic is upturned to keep the tray itself dry. Maintenance consists of merely taking the drawer out to the trash, and sliding the pad out, putting in a new one, and sliding the drawer back into the bottom of the box.<br /><br />The litter itself are hard pellets, which hardly get tracked, and it is 100% dustless.  A pellet or two stick to paws, but are easily picked up and tossed back into the box.  Scooping is easy, and if the poo is dry, you can kind of shake it around in the scoop to knock off some of the pellets, then throw it in the trash instead of wasting water with a toilet flush.<br /><br />It takes mere seconds to maintain the box vs. 10 minutes of scooping and scraping soggy clumping litter which doesn't really clump, but falls apart.<br /><br />When it's time to change the litter (once a month), it just pours into the trash, no scraping the soggy wet concrete of old.<br /><br />Some say you get a 'poo' smell, since kitties can't bury it quite like they did with the old type of litter, but I'll take that over the overpowering stench of fermented urine any day.  And, the smell goes away quite shortly, just like human smell in the bathroom.  Note that you should just use one bag of the pellets in the box, the litter won't be as deep.  I just give the box a quick shake daily to even it back out.<br /><br />Cat adaption to the new box:  This won't work for everyone, but this is what I did:  I set up the new Breeze system next to the old box (which was fairly gross, as I let it get bad) to see what would happen.  I placed a clump of the old litter into the new box to let him know it was 'his.'  My 9 year old fellow was pretty much using the new box right away (probably out of curiousity more than anything).  After 3 days or so, I removed the old box and inserted it directly into the garbage, never to be dealt with again.  No problems, 100% compliance on Max's part.<br /><br />If Tidy Cats came out with a fully hooded version of the box, it would be great for the folks who have standing pee-ers, but my fellow doesn't do that, so I'm lucky.<br /><br />Finally, some say the pellets and pads are expensive, but I estimate the cost as about equal to the old style of box over the long run - and the convenience and ease of maintenance should erase any other doubt.<br /><br />Also, this system has the potential of keeping tons of conventional clay litter out of landfills.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: like it so far(1 day) , added info after a week
review/text: I got this yesterday and so far it looks good, I've been using silica litter but even the cheap stuff is not that cheap and is fairly dusty, so I've been looking for an alternative and this seems to be it.  The silica works great for drying up odors until it gets pee saturated. I sprinkled at little of the old wet litter on the breeze litter and the cats used it right away.  The pee does drain through and the pads are good, they've used it quite a few times and the pad still feels dry.  I'm actually hoping they DON'T poop in it and continue to use the silica for that, then I'll have the best of both worlds, the poop will dry and the pee will be able to be gotten rid of so the expensive silica will last longer.<br /><br />After a week, still on the first pad and haven't noticed any odor problems.  Have 3 cats and left the silica so they are using both but they are using the breeze a lot.  Adding crystals or enzyme spray to the pad might stretch it's life out even longer.  They've pooped in the breeze too and I haven't noticed a smell but lots of pellets glue tight so I'm losing quite a few each time.  I'm used to the silica, which is much cleaner than clay or clumping and I haven't noticed any increased odor with the breeze.<br /><br />Changed the pad on the 8th day because, well really how far do you want to push it, and no sign of trouble.  It was HEAVY with no sign of leakage or deterioration  (I didn't really try to stress test it, but it came out of the tray and into the bag with no problem).

review/summary: Worked great for pee & hard poo, BUT could not stand the poop smell
review/text: Back when I used the breeze cat system, there were 4 cats in the apartment (2 are my cats, and the other 2 were my brother's cats that I was temporarily taking care for him).  I had the breeze next to the original litter box for 3 days and none of the cats used it.  They all went on top of the pellets to check it out but did not pee/poop in there.  One of the cats tried to eat a pellet and I took it away from him.  I *think* none of them actually ate it.<br /><br />On the 4th day, I took the original litter box away, and then they all started using the breeze.  There were no "accidents" in the apartment and I did not find pee or poop on the floor or carpet.  I think the fact that I placed some of the pellets with their original litter really helped them get accustomed to the product (and also since the breeze system was sitting there for 3 days, they were at least familiarized with it).<br /><br />The pad that sucked up the pee worked really well.  I experimented to figure out the right time to change the pad for the 4 cats.  It turned out to be every 3 days.  As for hard poop, I was ok with it staying at the top of the system and would pick it up with a plastic bag and throw it out (very easy).<br /><br />The problem is with the runny/watery poop which will go all over the pellets and is tougher and takes longer to clean.  A lot of the pellets ended up getting thrown out once the watery poop touched them.  Also, this system does not do anything to help minimize the poop smell, which is the main complaint for my boyfriend regarding this system.  In the end, we did not keep the breeze because the smell was too horrible.  Even if you clean it up immediately after the cat pooped, the smell was still there.<br /><br />We went back to the original litter box.  I am going to keep my eye on this product to see if tidy cats come out with better pellets that will do something about poop smell.  If that time ever comes, I would buy it because I know my cats will use this system & it did wonders for the pee... now if only the poop situation works out!

review/summary: My tips for making this system work
review/text: We have 3 long haired cats and have tried every litter box under the sun that promised "no tracking".  This system is the first that truly delivered.  WE still get a few pellets outside the boxes but they are easy to pick up with our hand vacuum.<br />We've been using the system for 4 months now and here are some tricks we found to make it work. We find that Pet Fresh (made by Arm & Hammer and usually used for carpets is a BIG help in keeping the odors under control. It's really cheap too.)<br /><br />1. Right after they go number 2, we sprinkle Pet Fresh on it.  This is because one of our cats doesn't cover his poops after he goes. The scoop works best after they have a chance to dry out a little.<br /><br />2. The loose stool issue.  It can be a real mess trying to get them out with a scoop.  I found that using paper towels or toilet paper to pick them up is the easiest and cleanest way to get them out.<br /><br />3. The pan that holds the pads starts to retain the smell of urine after a month or 2.  Solution:  Sprinkle Pet Fresh on the pan, then put the pad in the pan.<br /><br />4.  Issue: the sides of the pan start to smell and poop gets stuck to it. Solution:  We keep Wipes, paper towels and spray cleaner near the box and wipe the box and scoop whenever it gets dirty.<br /><br />5.  Expense:  We have found that if we look out for coupons and sales we can get the pads for about a dollar each and the pellets last a month in each box.  We used to change the litter ever week and went through so much that we have found this system to actually be cheaper.  The worst place to buy the pellets and pads is Petco  - they are triple the price. Best place for us has been Target and Stop & Shop - we stock up when they are on sale.<br /><br />6.  Transitioning: It took us almost a month of increasing adding the pellets to the old litter.  Every time we scooped the old litter we added more pellets.  The whole time we had the new system right next to the old one. By the time the old system was almost all pellets they were using both so we got more breezes and got rid of the old. We did have a couple times where they went outside the box, but that was it.<br /><br />It wasn't easy to change, but to not have litter and urine tracked all over the house is such a god send that it was well worth the trouble.  My greatest fear is that they might stop making the refills!  I was glad to read that someone said you could use the system without with the pads if you dump the urine every day.  That would be not be ideal but it's nice to know it works.  I was also thinking you could use doggie pee pads if necessary. As for the pellets, I'm going to try "Yesterdays' News" pellets and see if they would work.  or may even tiny river rocks that are washable?  washable pellets you don't have to replace would be awesome for the environment.  Trouble is they won't get to make as money off them - but I"m going to be on the look out for something that works!

review/summary: Great System, but not inexpensive
review/text: I have two cats (male, 12 pounds & female, 7 pounds) and just switched from the Scoop Free (because I had to scoop constantly due to my cat's litter habits) to the Breeze.<br /><br />I love the Breeze because it is very easy, low maintenance, and has excellent odor control.  The only negative is the maintenance cost, but I figured out the usage for my household and it's virtually the same cost as the Scoop Free system.  It is not an economical system compared to scoopable litter, clay litter, or all natural litter alternatives.  You are paying for convenience and the neatness.  It's really mess-free and I never have to touch the pad, just dump the tray into the trash.<br /><br />I'm confused by some of the poor reviews because it really is a simple system.  Honestly, you'd have to be really drunk or half brain dead to screw it up.  It has to be used as a complete system.  It doesn't work if you try to not use the pads or take some other random cost-cutting measure.  I cannot figure out how the urine pan could leak at all if you are using the pad (right side up with the green plastic side down and the absorbant white side up) and you are changing it when it becomes full.  It functions like a diaper, once the absorbancy has been exhausted, that's it.  You get longer life/better absorbancy if you rotate the tray since cats tend to pee in the same area of the box every time.  If you have multiple cats and one box, or a large cat that pees a lot, you may need to change your pad more often, but that's specific to your cat.  If you are using the box properly with any amount of common sense applied, it will not leak.<br /><br />The bag of pellets is sparse, but that's because it is just supposed to let the urine pass through and give your cat a comfortable environment to allow burying.  The pellets are not meant to absorb the urine, or stick to the poop.  They do recommend that you completely change the pellets every month, so you don't really want to put in more than you need for your cat's comfort.  Both my cats are quite content with one pack.  There is no tracking with these pellets, I rarely find more than two or three pellets on the floor near the box.  I do not find that the pellets remove any odor from the solid waste.  I do notice an odor right after my cat has a bowel movement, or if the box is left longer than day without scooping out the solid waste.  I scoop daily into a litter locker and have no odor in the general areas of the box (unless there is something very fresh).  My pads last a full week, I do have to rotate them once. I have never smelt urine from this box.<br /><br />I do want to point out that because we have two cats and three levels of the house we did add additional boxes per the mfg recommendation (which I thought was crazy initially), however, it really did improve my cats' litter habits.  One cat was using alternative (and undesirable) areas to relieve herself (like my suitcase, laundry basket, etc.)  Once I put in multiple boxes, that behavior completely stopped.<br /><br />We have three boxes for the two cats, one at each level: basement, 1st floor, 2nd floor.  The pads generally last at least a week for all boxes, occasionally one box will be used less and a pad will last two weeks.  The pellets are still odor free after 6 weeks.  I agree that the refill costs are high, but as I said, comparable with the ScoopFree system, but this was actually cleaner and easier given the unique habits of my cats.  For me, the cost is worth the ease, convenience and general cleanliness of the system.

review/summary: BEWARE! READ UPDATE!!
review/text: I purchased 2 of these systems for my 5 cats (we have 3 other litter boxes).  One of my cats injested some of the litter pellets and has been in the veterinarian hospital in bad shape for the last 3 days.  After xrays, and sedatives, enemas and iv fluids and blood tests, the vet removed 9 pellets, found a raging UTI and his kidney values are through the roof!  I called the manufacturer to find out what was in the pellets and was told: zeolite, silica, cement, and polysomethingorother.<br />Their website does not tell you that, just says no problem if your cat ingest - it'll will pass thru.  Not so!  I already have a vet bill in excess of $500 it is climbing because they have to keep him there!!<br />Update September 15, 2008<br />Vet bill in excess of $1000, kidney failure and Freddie died on Saturday, September 13, 2008.

review/summary: A little secret/new product idea
review/text: Previously to receiving this system, hubby and I were attempting to train our 2 young kitties to use a human toilet, to no avail.  I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay).  That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well.<br /><br />Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts).  This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore.  They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter.  So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it.<br /><br />I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise.  I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl.  Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated.  :P<br /><br />All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets.  That would be AWESOME... *nudge nudge to the litter companies*

review/summary: Works, but still sticks to poop. Washable!
review/text: I got my 6-pack in a larger bag that was packed in a cardboard box about 2 weeks ago - no tears or rips in any of the packs. Thanks to the Amazon Subcription Service, cat litter is now delivered to my door with free shipping and I don't have to lug a 20lb bag from the store anymore.<br /><br />Reason for the 4 stars: Poop still sticks to the pellets and I lose a few everytime I scoop, and it does not control poop odor. But that's ok, I just use an air freshener spray. I use 1.5 bags each time since 1 pack doesn't seem to be enough.<br /><br />Anyway, the pellets are washable! I was curious - so I tried and the pellets weren't all that dirty anyway as I had already scooped the dirty (pop-covered) ones out. I poured the used litter into the bottom part of an old hooded litter box that had hot water and detergent in it (I use the hood for the Breeze litterbox!). I let it soak for about 20 mins whilst I washed and dried the Breeze litter box, changed the pee pad, and poured in a new bag of litter. I used an old kitchen/dish brush that has a long handle and sort of "scrubbed" the used pellets in the soapy water for a few minutes and then drained the water into the toilet bowl and then rinsed it out a number of times until the water was clear. Drained it as much as I could, and then left the box in the bathtub with the window open to air-dry it, and closed the tub screen so my cat wouldn't think he had an extra litter box in the bathtub! The pellets were clean and completely dry within 2-3 days. Kinda interesting that it can be washed and we're not generating more garbage to pollute the earth. Plus, for anyone wanting to save some money....

review/summary: Pure heaven!!!!!
review/text: I was skeptical, as I'm sure you are! I read review after review just to make sure I knew of any known issues. Which are few are far between. To say the least, I am absolutely amazed by this litter box and wish it came out 10 years ago!<br /><br />I am, now, the un-proud owner of a Litter Mate litter box. For the last year I have used it as a regular litter box (where I would scoop myself. Just too frustrated with the mechanism of the whole thing.) Anyway, I finally found a litter that did a decent job in that box, it's hard to find one! I settled on Tidy Cats scooping litter. Well, one day I was comparing prices online at my local grocery store and at Target when I came across this system. I decided to check out Amazon and the reviews.<br /><br />With little hesitation I ordered the litter box, pellets, and pads. I also put the pellets and pads on Amazon subscription to receive 15% off each order and I could cancel at anytime. I ordered the pellets and pads because I didn't think the litter box came with anything and I was anxious to use it once I received it. Well, it did come with a 4 pack of pads and a 3 lb bag of pellets, enough to get you started.<br /><br />I set it up right away, right next to their usual litter box. I checked the pad the next day and a cat, or two, had used that box! I was so excited! I left it there for 3 weeks because neither one of my cats went #2 in the new box. I was getting discouraged. I did what was suggested by putting some of the pellets in the regular box so the cats could get used to the feel of them. Still nothing. So finally, with fingers crossed, I eliminated the regular litter box and only made available the Breeze litter box. I came home from work that evening and prayed they would use the box for both duties.....AND THEY DID!!! I was thrilled!!<br /><br />I have never smelled the #2 like some reviewers have mentioned, I don't know if they do it while I'm away or asleep, but there has been no odor.<br /><br />I would suggest either getting more than one box if you have 2 or more cats. Tidy Cats suggests 1 box for each cat plus one. I only have one box and change the pad 2 times per week and it has worked perfectly, but knowing how well it works and how easy it is to maintain, I will be buying a second one!! I love that there is no litter to vacuum up or get tracked on the wood floor only to step on in bare feet!<br /><br />I love this litter box!!<br /><br />August 9, 2008: UPDATED I still LOVE this litter box!! It is by far one of the best things ever invented! I am telling all my cat owner friends about it and insist they buy this! I have to admit, I am a lazy litter box care taker, because of a busy life. This litter box makes it a lot easier to care for and it's so quick to clean! I plan to move it to a bathroom soon so I can flush the solids since I tend to scoop them out every day or two, it would make it that much easier.<br /><br />If you are hesitating at all, you really should give it a try. I bought it before they reduced the price by $20! I risked $40 to try it, you can risk $20!

review/summary: Had such great hopes, but......
review/text: We have three cats - two wanted nothing to do with it no matter how many times we tried.  Ended up pooping on the carpet, something they have never done before.<br /><br />The other cat, who uses this litterbox, gets diahrea on a regular basis.  The box is not designed for that type of mess!  We ended up scooping most of the granules out.<br /><br />So if your cat has these type of issues, do not use!

review/summary: One of the best Belgian ales on the market today
review/text: Weighing in at 8.5% alcohol by volume, the sardonically named Delirium Tremens has a well-rounded, robust flavor that finishes with a slight hoppiness.  One of the unfortunate problems associated with many ales that start getting close to double-digit alcohol volumes is a a noticeably sweet flavor associated with the high sugar levels.  Fortunately, Delirium Tremens avoids this pitfall without sacrificing alcohol content.  Interestingly, it is a bit more carbonated than most of the top-tier Belgian ales, but this seems to add to its distinct character.  It also has an aesthetically pleasing label, replete with dancing crocodiles, Chinese dragons, and pink elephants. I am a Belgian beer/Belgian style beer fanatic, and this particular ale is one of my favorites.  Forget about impostors like Stella Artois and Blue Moon!  Try Delirium Tremens instead...

review/summary: Best instant chicken soup ever
review/text: I have tried many soups lately in search of something that tastes as close to homemade as possible without cooking for 5 hours.  Chicken Noodle is hard to find since Grandma made the best ever from scratch.  I've tried so many cans and mixes I almost didn't want to waste anymore money in search of good soup that was seemingly nowhere to be found.  This was on sale for $13 and I bit the bullet.  Thank goodness!!!!!  I loved it - I added nothing but assumed it would need salt, pepper, chicken, and veggies added to be good.  But this is great all on it's own. I went to put it away twice and each time had another cup.  I'd always rather have homemade but I am so happy to find something edible that doesn't taste like it's package or like chemicals or preservatives, now I need to try another Bear Creek flavor.

review/text: This is not the best dried chicken noodle soup I have had, but it is very good and better than most. I tried this because I love the Bear Creek Potato Soup - It Is The Best!!. But my personal preference for the dried chicken noodle soup is the Alessi brand. I would say that this comes in a close second. I made it according to directions and then stirred in a small can (about 6 oz) of cooked white meat chicken. Made it a little heartier. I would buy this again if Alessi wasn't available.

review/summary: best white tea...
review/text: I wish I could give 6 out of 5 stars !  With so many choices, I gave two leaves and a bud - a try.  Judging by the package outside, it's like a regular brown box, no fancy tin.  But, the tea is individually wrapped in some soft satin materials and you can see the little tea leaves.  Then, each is wrapped in a plastic to maintain freshness !!  I was blown away by the packaging already at this point.  Then the tasting began, it's such a smooth, delicate tea - I can't describe how nice it is but I quit the cheap lipton or any other brand.  This is the tea for me.

review/summary: Not Up To My Expectations!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Two Leaves and a Bud.  They make a beautiful English Breakfast Tea and many others.  I ordered this giant box of White Tea being a Tea lover and especially a White and Green Tea lover.  The idea of Rose Pedals in my Tea was also enticing and I dreamed about early mornings on my deck, sipping White Peony Tea with Angels flying and Songbirds singing.  Not really. But I did have high hopes for this Tea and I was let down.  The leaves are too small, the Tea goes bitter quickly and it's hard to brew as the bag won't immerse easily in the water.  Try Mighty Leaf Teas for real White and Green Teas.  They are almost unmatched in quality.  For more reviews please visit my blog [...]

review/summary: Great value, great for your health
review/text: I didn't actually notice that this was the non-organic version until it arrived, though that doesn't bother me.  One other difference is the amount of tea per bag.  My last batch of organic from POP had  2 grams per individual bag, and this one has 1.8 grams per bag.  This won't affect anyone much.  I used to get 6 large cups out of the old 2g bags.  White tea just brews a little more than an equal amount of more processed teas.  I mostly drink 3 to 4 cups a tea these days, and the 1.8 gram bags manage that just fine.  I also sense no difference in taste between the organic and non-organic versions.  In the future, I'll buy whichever I can find cheaper.<br /><br />This is, in addition to being a bargain, a cheap quality of tea.  You get what you pay for and cheap is exactly what I'm looking for, personally.  It doesn't have as delicate a taste as some more expensive batches, and it can be a bit harsh, but I drink mine straight up without sugar or any other flavoring.  It still provides that clear headed feeling that is the trademark of a good caffeine and l-theanine balance, and it's still a great source of antioxidants.  Healthy dietary choices are normally a lot more expensive than this.

review/summary: Great healthy tea
review/text: My girlfriend is an avid tea drinker and Ph.D. (so she's very smart!) and she has researched every kind of tea there is.  She says this is the #1 most healthy tea to drink.  Loaded with anti-oxidants and just a little bit of caffeine.  To take the edge off, she adds a couple of drops of Agave syrup.  I am a former coffee drinker (bad caffeine withdrawals) so i don't mind the "dry" taste of this tea.  I like it, actually.  (I used to drink black coffee, strong!)  It's an added bonus that this everyday, not fancy tea is also very affordable.  I start every day with a cup.

review/summary: Smoked Bacon Great Anytime
review/text: October 14, 2012.  We received our bacon just this week.  It came in a neat, thick styrofoam box with a frozen cold pack.  We hit it right and got an extra pound of smoked bacon included with the price.  Shipped FEDEX and got here quick!  We have only tried the Applewood Smoked Bacon but were extremely impressed.  The slices were thicker and smokier than the national brands. The smoke flavor was not bitter at all and very palatable. True to advertising, they shrank very little.  The finished texture was chewier rather than crisp, but we enjoyed that.  We topped our shrimp grits with the bacon and cheddar cheese and all were superb.<br /> Today we had hot sliced turkey sandwiches with two slices of the Applewood smoked bacon.  Absolutely delicious! The warm bread and mayo and bacon combo was so rich and flavorful! This is truly the tastiest bacon I have ever eaten.  I cannot wait to get to the Cherrywood Smoked and Pepper Bacon.  Both will be amazing, I'm sure.

It is not the most flavorful Granola - if you want more fat and sugar (and flavor), try Udi's, Back to Nature, etc. I pour granola on top of lower sugar Yogurt (Nancy's) and for flavor, I add a few pecans, dried cranberries, or cherries. If I want more, I'll sprinkle a little of the other Granolas on them. OK - I haven't tried Galaxy's Cranberry/Orange, since it's not available at my stores, so it is next on my Galaxy "More Flavor" List. Galaxy is a great, healthy choice - I only wish it were organic.

review/summary: Delicious meal
review/text: Rao's is famous for their marinara sauce, and justifiably so.  It has a freshness and authenticity that I've not found in any other packaged sauce, and works well on its own or as a base (I like to add canned clams for a quick red clam sauce).<br /><br />But, the Italian Sausage and Mushroom takes the Rao's tradition of flavor and quality in a new and wonderful direction.  Rather than a simple red sauce, this sauce has complex flavors, with the savory mushrooms and sweet Italian sausage mixing well with fresh herbs in a rich red base.  Rao's bills this sauce as "Dinner to Go," and that's fair.  You really don't need to do anything to it -- just heat it up and serve over some good quality pasta with some good grated cheese.<br /><br />My local grocer used to carry this sauce, and I was very disappointed when they dropped it from their lineup of Rao's sauces.  Until I can get them to put it back on the shelf, I guess it will be mail order for me!

review/summary: Really great stuff
review/text: I ordered this product direct from ener-g website. Its really great stuff. It is the only baking powder that is sodium AND potassium free. So those who must avoid both can use this baking powder.<br />I just want to mention that there are two versions of this baking powder. An older version and a new improved version. MAKE SURE you get the NEW IMPROVED version. When I ordered from them I got two new and one old. I tryed them both and the old version didn't make the recipe rise but more than that it tasted disgusting. I called them back and they immediately sent me anothe new version of their baking powder.<br />Before buying I read some reviews and read that it can't be used in some recipes, I just want to clarify that this is absolutely not true. This baking powder can be used in any and every recipe I can think of, but there is a trick to using it. The only problem with this baking powder is that after mixing with wet ingredients it starts working. And if you wait too long to put it in the oven all the gas will have been used up. The trick is to use it at the end. My trick, which has worked perfectly every time with every recipe, is to even mix the wet and dry ingredients together before and make sure the oven is pre-heated. Then just before putting it in the oven you mix the baking powder in the mixture. It mixes and dissolves very easily with no lumps. And then put it in for baking. It works perfectly. Very small price to pay for such an awesome product.<br />do the same for any other recipe even pancakes or anything else.<br />I know of another sodium free baking powder from HAIN called featherweight baking powder BUT it contains Potassium. And it too is a single acting baking powder so you have to use it the same way I described.<br /><br />One more thing, the main ingredient in this baking powder is calcium carbonate. By using this baking powder in your foods you will be adding alot of calcium to your diet. This is Great.<br /><br />Oh sorry, one more very important note. You MUST use alot of this baking powder to have successful results. If a recipe asks for one teaspoon of baking powder then you must use around one and a half TABlESPOONS not teaspoons (which is around 5 teaspoons). The directions say to use two or three times as much but I found that using around 4 to 5 times as much gives me the best results. Surprisingly using too much never caused the end product to taste off in any way, only maybe a little dry.

review/text: I go into anaphylaxis after ingesting corn... in any form. To my dismay, corn is in just about every brand of baking powder that I searched out. This stuff though :)... Nope. NO CORN! YES! I am also Celiac, so I can't have gluten. A good leavening is necessary when one is baking without gluten. Ener-G has been the ticket! I am so grateful for this brand of baking powder. It is only a single acting powder rather than the usual double acting, but I haven't had any problems with this.

review/text: Need to use a lot of it, but love that it's sodium and potassium free, most low sodium baking sodas use a potassium compound which is no good for patients on dialysis, this works though. However it's not so great for things you cook on the stovetop such as pancakes, but for food that goes in the oven like muffins or bread it's fine.

review/summary: Dog loves them, but smelly
review/text: My dog goes absolutely crazy for these, and the majority of bones and treats he doesn't eat.  We were driving to one of those awful places that describes itself as a "boutique" dog store and paying $5 per bone, but ordering these online cuts down on both the cost and the pretentiousness.<br /><br />CAUTION:  These things smell like fish!  They don't just smell like fish, they will make about 400 square feet of your house smell like fish!  They are individually wrapped, and even through the shipping envelope a nasty fish odor permeated.<br /><br />Again, my dog loves them.  I had wrapped the envelope in two plastic bags and he was still going insane at the smell.  If you have a locking storage container with a rubber seal, that works pretty well, though I recommend a vacuum sealer.

review/summary: Border Collie magic!
review/text: My Border Collie Cass has, like so many others, obsessive compulsive disorder.  I mean why else would they perform as they do unless bred for compulsive behavior with sheep, tennis balls, and frisbes?  She licks the floor.  She over reacts to loud noises.  Even to the parakeet's screeches.  She hates going in the car. We live close to the National Guard Air field and they practice shooting a lot.  So she practices over-reacting a lot.  At one point she licked the hardwood floor till it had a worn place when we were gone for a long time.  I tried everything I could, from exercise (she's great on a treadmill!) to extracts and herbs to a tight fitting Tellington touch jacket.  Nothing helped much.  I finally found these calming treats!  They WORK!!  I have my lovely Border Collie back.  She plays joyfully again.  Sure she still hates the gun shots but she just keeps calm and tucks her tail a bit.  She rode happily in the car and ran crazy 8's at the off leash park like a puppy (she's 9). Thanks so much Pet Naturals!

review/summary: Good product for a stressed out dog!
review/text: I foster dogs for an animal rescue, and because I don't have dogs of my own yet, I tend to take the dogs that don't get along with other animals.  They are wonderful when they're at home with me, but taking them to the adoption events to try and get them adopted is another story...  Some of the dogs HATE being at the adoption events, where there are anywhere form 30-50 other dogs looking for their forever home.  So, I've handled quite a few medium-large dogs that lunge, growl, bark at any dog that comes near us while where there.  It's not very fun!  This is where these calming chews come in handy!  I double (and sometimes triple) the doseage for the 3 hours that I'm at the adoption event.  It's helped a little....can't say that it solves the problem completely, but I do notice a difference in my foster dog's anxiety level!

review/summary: Great
review/text: Xylitol is fantastic for dental health.<br /><br />This gum is great because it doesn't contain any of the less-than-ideal additives (like aspartame-nutrasweet, saccharin, sorbitol, mannitol, artificial flavors, artificial colors, etc.) that make most other gums and mints, even those with xylitol as an ingredient, problematic.<br /><br />The flavor is nice, the texture is fine, and it lasts for at least 15 minutes (which is all I want it to do).<br /><br />Note that this gum is manufactured in Finland and the xylitol is sourced from birch wood [also, it's non-GMO (not genetically modified)], which is not the case with some other brands of xylitol products, which source their xylitol from China and/or from corn.<br /><br />I wish that this gum could be purchased in smaller amounts, because the price for this company's giant containers/packs is quite a lot of money to spend on something you've never tried before.  I'm sure more people would give them a try if they packaged this in one 30-piece, portable little cardboard box, and sold it as an "add-on" product at Amazon for 2 dollars or something, just so folks could try it out.

review/summary: Flavor doesn't last very long, but this is still the best sugar-free gum I've found (so far)
review/text: I'll agree with another reviewer here that flavor longevity could be improved, but I also have to say that I don't see Trident as a viable, sugar-free gum alternative at this time.<br /><br />Many gum-makers are starting to embrace the benefits of Xylitol and incorporate the ingredient into their product lines, but most of them (Trident included) supplement the sweetener with either sucralose (Splenda) or aspartame (Nutrasweet, Equal), both of which are toxic and are responsible for many ill side-effects. Sucralose is basically chlorinated sugar, chlorine being, basically, bleach. Not something one would want to ingest into one's body. Aspartame has been on the market longer, and its effects have been well-documented over the years. It contains neurotoxins, including methanol (which also occurs naturally in fruits along with ethanol and pectin, which greatly slow down its metabolization, greatly decreasing its potency) that your body metabolizes directly to formaldehyde. Among other things, aspartame has been known to cause extreme fatigue, depression, severe headaches, skin diseases, severe muscle weakness, vomiting, Bells Palsy, and even death (including among healthy athletes who drink a lot of diet sodas and use energy powders like MetRx, both of which include aspartame).<br /><br />Google "aspartame poisoning" and/or "sucralose poisoning" for more info.<br /><br />So, until someone is able to point out a better tasting xylitol-sweetened gum that includes neither aspartame or sucralose, I'll be buying XyliChew.

I thought I would find a better deal buying large quantities over the internet, but I guess not.<br /><br />The best deal I have found is 7-11, where a 4-pack can be had for $6. That's only $1.50 per can.

review/summary: Its wonderful this stuff.
review/text: I work at a really boring job and this is sometimes the only thing that keeps me from falling asleep. I have never had any real issues from it unless you drink too much. Then yes you can get super hyper and the shakes but there is a warning on the can for that. I have gotten really bad reactions from other drinks like ucky stomach feelings and shakey immediately but this never does that to me. Also, lo carb like 9 calories in the whole can. Awesome!!!

review/summary: Drink with caution
review/text: Love the taste of this in comparison with the other energy drinks.<br /><br />However, as a word of note: you should read the warning labels on the can. Typically you shouldn't drink more than 2 of these a day (even though the can says 3). However I drink ~1 can a day because I regularly exercise and need that afternoon "pick-me-up" while at work on occassion.

review/text: Have been loocking for the taste I remember from my childhood aroune the wurst-stands in the city.<br />Zeisner has brought all good memories back. Goes with any kind of brat or wiener, however, I found Usinger's Knackwurst or Beef Wieners to be the best. Grill, cook or fry your wurst. Slice in 1" pieces. Add plenty of Zeisners's an sprinkle a little Thai curry powder on top.<br />Enjoy!

review/text: These veggie chips taste great......fresh and crisp! BUT I am very disappointed in short expiration date.....12 bags arrived 8/31/09 and all expire 10/21/09. I really hadn't planned on plowing through these 12 bags in less than 8 weeks! It would be MOST helpful if expiration dates were included in product information! I purchase a wide variety of grocery items frequently and this is first time I have been disappointed. I do hope it will be the last time!

review/summary: half of the bag is amazing
review/text: These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.  It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it.  Get with it, Terra!

review/summary: Great surprise
review/text: I have to admit trying these just out of simple curiosity. Yes, they are bright colored as the picture shows. The flavor is what has me hooked. As other reviewers have stated, each chip has its own and varied flavor. It turns a bag of traditional potato chips into boring by contrast. I am not much of a potato chip eater--but these are definitely a favorite. I love sharing them with friends, who are equally impressed with their unique textures and colors. Beisdes good eating, they are a great conversation piece. Not too salty. You truly savor each one. Enjoy.

review/summary: Root veggies and spices... wow
review/text: Oh my goodness... I am NOT a chip kind of person, but these are the most amazing chips I have ever tasted in my life.  I have nothing of value to add to this review (you can't objectively rate a food product!!!) other than to rave over their taste.<br /><br />If you like a variety of root vegetables combined with a very fitting combination of spices... just try these.<br /><br />Yes, some of the chips are very HARD to chew, but come on people, use your common sense here:  soften them in your mouth longer, and savor the taste of the spices!  Only plain old boring potato chips can get away with being shoveled in your mouth.  But these are special chips!!<br /><br />I buy these at my local store, and I shamefully finish the small bag by the time I'm home.  They need to start selling them in bigger bags.

review/summary: Great product...just not in small packages!
review/text: I love Terra chips...when they are in the big bags from the store...I ordered these expecting the same quality and it wasn't. The chips in these small bags (which were perfect for my lunch bag) were stale and tasteless. Some of the chips were too stale to comfortably chew. I don't know if they are sitting around too long in a warehouse somewhere or they don't do well in small packages, but don't order these chips like this.

review/summary: Possibly the best chips I've ever had
review/text: These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health.

review/summary: Fabulous chips!
review/text: I have always been a reluctant vegetable eater...until I discovered Terra chips!  I never knew veggies in chip form could be so tasty.  The plain is good but the Mediterranean flavor is my favorite.  Spicy, flavorful, crunchy but not too hard.  Not greasy, either.  The price on Amazon is substantially cheaper than grocery stores as well.  These aren't leaner than your typical potato chip but they are higher in fiber and overall nutritional value.  Try them...I am sure you will be hooked!

These are 1 oz servings so they are small but it's enough for a snack or with a sandwich.  These chips are very crunchy and made of weird veggies, not potatoes so if you don't like sweet potatoes, beets, and other weird root veggies you probably won't like them, but...everybody I know who has tried them like them!

review/text: These chips, which are made from different vegetables besides potatoes are great if you want a different type of potato chip.  However, don't be fooled like me into thinking they are a healthy snack-they are made the way regular potato chips are-fried in oil.  So, if you are not loooking for health food-you ought to try them.

review/summary: Crunchy but too hard to eat
review/text: The only thing good about this product is the packaging.  The chips themselves are okay, not great.  Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on.  They are as hard as rocks.  I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left.  For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad).  The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock.  Maybe some people like this kind of chips.  Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk.
