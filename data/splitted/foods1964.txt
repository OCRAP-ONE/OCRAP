review/summary: Switch
review/text: This is good if drank cold, it could be used as a mix too. It is a little steep in price and high in calories too. If you don't mind the price and want a natural alternative to soda it is good.<br /><br />I recommend giving it a try, 4 stars.

review/summary: Fruit juice with no corn syrup or sugar
review/text: Switch fruit beverage promises "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't want". To a large degree, Switch delivers on thst promise. According to the ingredients list, it contains no sugar or corn syrup, however it does have a syruppy sweetness to it. The watermelon strawberry flavor product comes from concentrates of watermelons and strawberries, but also from grapes, apples and acerola (whatever that is). The light carbonation adds to the refreshment.

review/summary: Read the label carefully
review/text: The Switch is apparently supposed to be a substitute for soda, with fizz but without corn syrup or added sugar, just juice for flavoring. However, the product, billed as "Watermelon Strawberry", has 140 calories in 8 ounces--more than one would get in soda--and is in fact mostly highly caloric apple and grape juice, for the sweetness, with strawberry and watermelon later in the ingredient list. Watermelon is one of my favorite flavors and I could not detect it in this product. "Natural" is NOT everything!

review/summary: Overly sweet for an unsweetened drink, tasty but not very natural
review/text: Design/packaging:  I really like the can size.  It's narrower than a soda can, but the same height as a soda can.  It fits very nicely in my hand, and I could easily toss one of these in my purse or daypack.<br /><br />Nutrition:  The calorie and sugar count seems high on this drink, but if you compare it to the nutrition of the same amount of pure, unsweetened grape juice, it's the same calorie and sugar count, plus or minus 10%.  (It's worth noting that grape juice is the first listed ingredient, so this makes sense.)  Thus, they're probably not adding sugar or calories to the juice to make the drink.  The thing is, you probably shouldn't down ten of these a day, but one can as a snack or pick-me-up seems reasonable.<br /><br />Flavor:  Here's where Switch falls short.  While I was pleased with the light carbonation and did find the texture (as described) to be a great balance between carbonated and non-carbonated.It tastes like a jolly rancher.  I'd be happier if it were a bit more watered down.  I think it might work best as a mixer, and maybe that's the intended purpose.<br /><br />Overall, I can't say that I would buy this again, but I wouldn't turn it down if it were offered to me.  It's really just too sweet.

review/summary: It tastes more like apple and grape juice than anything else
review/text: Switch Watermelon & Strawberry is a very good drink but the cans are way too small.  If I was actually thirsty, I would need at least three cans.  I also think the name of the drink is not accurate.  It tastes more like apple and grape juice than anything else.  I think they get away with calling it watermelon and strawberry because it has a strong aftertaste with these tastes.<br /><br />Switch is supposed to be healthier than soda but it still is a pretty sweet drink so don't expect something watered down or barely sweet.  All in all, I would say it is worth trying if you looking for something similar, but more natural, to soda.

review/summary: Pleasing Spritzer, Decent Mixer
review/text: My 8.3 oz. can of The Switch Watermelon Strawberry was nothing but short and sweet.  The small size of the beverage left me thirsty for more.  The strawberry flavor was too weak, even being outshone by the apple juice.  Still, the end result was a delicious soda and, despite some reviewers complaining of sickly sweet syrup, I thought they got The Switch just right.<br /><br />Take two:  Accompanying a small dose of gin, I found this carbonated juice a great match.  The flavors melded together nicely, though it could have been sweeter.  Ice probably would have pulled it together in a cinch.<br /><br />Overall, I prefer The Switch straight up and would have given it a 5/5 had the flavors been more Watermelony and Strawberlicious.

review/summary: Surprisingly good...
review/text: I am a big health food nut, and was dubious about this product, as (in my opinion) natural uncarbonated juices are best...My husband and I shared this for dessert the other night, and it was quite good. It really is a perfect combination of carbonation and juice. If you're into sodas, this is definitely a better option. (And this is not full of chemicals...a big plus.) The can is pretty small, so I lessened the star by one...it's expensive per serving that way.<br />If you or your kids insist on sodas or other carbonated beverages, this is a much better alternative for you--healthwise--and it tastes better, too.

review/text: I'm drinking this product as I write this and find it to be not too bad overall.  The strawberry watermelon flavor is very strong and the drink is not too heavily carbonated.  The can size is only 8.3 oz., there's no sugar or preservatives added. The down side is that this drink as a definite aftertaste.  It's a yeasty flavor that comes on every swallow and can also be smelled, to give you an idea how strong it is.  Like I said, it's not bad but I won't be buying any in the future.

review/text: Wow,this is the second Switch drink that I have tried and the flavor was great.  I could taste the watermelon with a hint of strawberry. The carbonation is so light that it does not seem like a carbonated drink at all. I am very happy that there is no added sugar or preservatives in my drinks.<br /><br />I normally do not drink carbonated beverages, but this is more like a sparkling fruit drink as opposed to carbonated like a Pepsi or Coke product.<br /><br />I enjoyed this flavor very much and look forward to trying other flavors in the Switch products.

review/summary: Tastes like Jolly Rancher candy in liquid form
review/text: Right off the bat, know that Switch isn't your traditional soda. There's no added sugar, no corn syrup, and no preservatives. It's carbonated but is all natural and is 100% juice. So while it's just juice (with Vitamin C, by the way), it still has that poppy bite to it because of the carbonation.<br /><br />Prior to trying this, I enjoyed the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">kiwi berry</a> flavor. I thought it would have paired well with a pastry, so this time around I tried the watermelon strawberry whilst snacking on a strawberry Pop Tart. You might think that's too much berry at one time, but they go well together. What I'm not thrilled about is that by itself the drink tastes like Jolly Rancher candy in liquid form. It's a bit tart. But the can is cool - it's like an energy drink can and thin for easy handling.

review/summary: The Kids Might Like It
review/text: This is a pretty sweet soda that's made from fruit juices without additives.  I thought it was ok but nothing to write home about.  It tastes more like sparkling-green-apple (but not tart) than fruit punch, and reminds ME a little of the way I remember SLICE tasting (I don't eat Jolly Ranchers.)  It's not super carbonated, which I like.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that this is a small (but not mini) can - 8.3 fluid ounces as opposed to a typical soda in a 12 fl oz can.  Presumably the point is to get the kiddiewinks off the high-sugar sodas, and as other folks've pointed out, this 8.3 can of The Switch has 140 calories and 36 grams of carbs - and 35g of sugar, though it's 'natural' sugars.  That compares to 150 calories, 42g carbs, and 42g sugars in my 12 oz Cherry Coke.  I think I'll make the switch - back.

review/text: To me, this just tasted like apple juice with a slight strawberry aftertaste. It is also a lot of calories for 8 oz. No more than plain apple juice, so if you normally include juice in your daily diet, this could be a fun alternative. Usually I don't drink juice, I go for calorie free beverages (either water, diet soda or flavored carbonated water) to save on calories. Though this drink is marketed as "healthy" because it doesn't have sugar or artificial sweetener, it's still got plenty of calories for limited nutritional value.

review/text: I don't drink sodas/pop very much though I was once a total Coke-aholic. As I have aged, I've lost my taste for sweet--and for high fructose corn syrup. I do, though, enjoy bubbly water, even those that come with a bit of a flavor, so I figured I'd try this.<br /><br />It was delicious. There is no extra sugar, but it's still pretty sweet--as if watermelon strawberry is going to be anything else, I guess. I found it cool, crisp, and refreshing--light despite the sweetness factor. And there's no icky, artificial aftertaste. If I see these in stores when I'm thirsty, I'll likely try a potentially less sweet flavor.<br /><br />If you like a sweet beverage that doesn't come loaded with added sugar or corn syrup or a whole list of preservatives, I highly recommend Switch. I'd probably opt for one of these mixed with about the same volume of seltzer, but I'm funny about sweetness.

My seven year-old gives this 5 stars, but it is a little too much for an adult palette.<br /><br />We still appreciate a soda replacement with no added sugar or preservatives.  It saves a little on the guilt.  We also tried Switch's Kiwi Berry which was not as sickeningly sweet for adults and still a hit with kids, but we will be getting Izzies for treats on a hot summer day.

It had these little bubbles that were quite pleasant<br /><br />It has about the same number of calories as the equivalent orange juice, and a lot of vitamin C... but I'm not going to swap it for my morning OJ.  Neither my wife nor I are really big soft-drink fans, but if it's a choice between Sprite or Switch? The cost is similar, and this is definitely the lesser evil.  We think we might Switch!

review/summary: Tasty, on the sweet side though, and expensive calories-wise
review/text: Up front this drink seems like it's not a bad alternative to drinking soda. It's got a real strong fruit taste to it, definitely not subtle like other flavored sparkling water drinks. It's pretty sweet, too. I liked it better than soda.<br /><br />The only thing that I'm concerned with is the 140 calories for a can that's only 8.3 ounces. A can of soda is 12 ounces and has about 150 calories, so you're really no better off drinking this stuff. The label is slightly misleading since it reads "100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't." I think there's a lot of people out there looking for something else to drink besides soda, since soda is so sugary and is the source of a lot of empty calories. That being said, this stuff definitely does not deliver on that front. It's filled with empty calories. Sure, there's no artificial flavor or color, which is good, but the bottom line is you will still pack on the pounds if you drink this stuff often enough. Due to this, I gave it 3 stars. It's a nice treat to have on occasion, but you certainly won't want to make this an everyday thing.

review/summary: Apple juice by any other name...
review/text: I received my sample from Amazon and the first thing that I did was pour it into a glass, over ice. While it's not bad, one thing that I will mention is that it just didn't taste like watermelon or strawberry...the taste is overwhelmingly that of apple juice...plain old apple juice. There are quite a few juices listed in the ingredients, including some not-so-common ones (acerola for instance), but I'm guessing the quantities were trace-like at best. Nope, what you get here is carbonated apple juice with maybe a hint of the berries' tartness...any watermelon flavor is lost somewhere in the mix, which isn't particularly surprising. Frankly, the effervescence is more pleasing than the actual taste.<br /><br />It's not really bad, I'd drink it again, but there are healthier things out there that you could be drinking. It might not have sugar added, but the sugar that's naturally in the juice is more than enough. All-natural doesn't always translate to good-for-you, which is something that seems to go over the head of some individuals. It might be better than soft drinks, but there really isn't much nutrition to be found here. All-in-all, it might be a good thing to toss in to mix things up a bit, but it's not something I'm going to think is going to turn my life around, or be particularly noteworthy when it comes to pleasing to my palette.

review/summary: Personally I liked it, but won't go out of my way to buy it
review/text: I tried this product through Amazon Vine, as have many other reviewers here.  Personally, I liked the flavor ... it was a little on the sweet side, but for me the carbonation added a nice bite that complemented the taste and kept the drink from being too one-note.  As others have noted, the drink is more strawberry than watermelon in flavor, but overall I liked it.<br /><br />It was interesting to read others' reviews, as many people focused on the drink's calorie and sugar content.  I personally do not look at nutrition labels, but from others' reviews it appears that this drink will have a difficult time winning more health-conscious consumers.  I imagine the target audience is more the "it has fruit on the label and is 100% juice, so it must be healthy" crowd.  Suckers like me, in others words!  The problem is that even for consumers like me, as someone who rarely drinks soda and would much rather just have water, it needed to be a five-star drink in order to make a convert of me, and it just wasn't at that level.  Since I got it through Amazon Vine, the product was free, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to buy it again.<br /><br />In the end, I thought it was pretty good, but just another pretty label on a crowded grocery store shelf.  From the reviewers here, it appears that it might be healthier than cola ... but it's not really "healthy".  I guess I'll just stick with water to quench my thirst!

review/text: I had high hopes for this juice, but the flavor disappointed.  I've tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LGGH40">The Switch Kiwi Berry</a>, and that flavor was accurate.  This variety I was left to wonder what juice is this?  It tastes great, but as other reviewers have noted the apple and grape juices muddle the flavor.  The carbonation is just right, nice and soft, a little like Perrier.  And a nice after-taste too.

review/summary: Not as healthy as they want you to think
review/text: I thought the taste was just okay (combination of Grape, Apple, Watermelon, and Strawberry juices) - it resembled a sparkling grape juice. I enjoyed it the once, but I won't be buying any for myself.<br /><br />It claims to be "100% of what you want" in a soda drink and "0% of what you don't." However, if you look at the nutrition facts on the label, for one 8.3 oz can you will consume 140 calories and 36g of carbs (35g of which is sugar), so when you compare this drink to, say, Pepsi, you are not necessarily making a better choice than you would be if you chose to drink the Pepsi. And you get MORE to drink in a can of Pepsi! The only difference is that there are no sugars (corn syrups, etc) added, no preservatives, no artificial colors, and no gluten.<br /><br />If it is important to you that you consume as few preservatives and sugars as possible and still have something sweet and fizzy to drink, then maybe this is the drink for you. But it's not for me.

review/summary: Interesting
review/text: I'm always down to review a beverage if it meets my criteria (alcohol-, coffee-, and artificial sweetener-free), and given that I was offered the opportunity to review this one and the criteria were met, I chose the one that seemed to promise the most interesting flavor profile.<br />The Switch Watermelon Strawberry is very sweet (not a problem for me), a bit tart (which is nice), and is very intensely flavored. Bizarrely enough, I don't find that it tastes strongly of either of its eponymous fruits; the flavors seem to have fused  into something else altogether. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a bit odd (bear in mind that taste is a very personal sense and that this is just my opinion).<br />What prevents me from awarding a full five stars isn't its flavor, however. Yes, it's sweetened with fruit juice, but an 8.3 oz. (where do they come up with these amounts?) serving weighs in at at whopping 140 calories--the same as a 12 oz. can of my lovingly hoarded "kosher for Passover" Coca Cola. It also contains 36 g of carbohydrates, 35 of which are from sugar. Granted, it contains 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C, but so does a supplement tablet, with no calories. So I really can't recommend this for those who are concerned about their weight or blood sugar.<br />Amazon currently carries this at &lt;$1/can with free shipping, which sounds about right. Were I to encounter this in a store, I might be tempted to pay $1/can but not on a regular basis; there's just not enough product there to justify the cost for me and the flavor's not remarkable enough. It's a nice beverage and I'm glad Switch Beverage was able to spare a can for me to review, but I doubt I'll be buying it for myself.

review/summary: Fruity, Light, Small Serving
review/text: I sampled both this Watermelon Strawberry and the Black Cherry flavors. I was very curious as to how this flavor would taste, because I love watermelon but don't usually like watermelon-favored drinks.<br /><br />I was quite pleased.  It was very sweet and light, not heavy or syrupy.  The taste was not overwhelming but was just right.  As advertised, it's carbonated which makes it go great with a meal.  Like the other flavor I tried, there was no aftertaste, since this is real sugar.<br /><br />My only disappointment with the product is the tiny can (8.3 oz). I'm not a fan of those, and even at Amazon's low prices these drinks are very expensive.<br /><br />For the healthy conscious, this is something you should look into.  There is real sugar, and no caffeine, no artificial stuff.  The ingredients are simple.  But don't think you're going to lose weight on this stuff.  There's 130 calories per tiny can, which is just a little bit fewer than the same serving size of Mountain Dew.  But since this is 100% juice, it's probably a little healthier.

review/summary: Good Soda
review/text: I really enjoy trying new things, so I found the idea of this soda pleasing.  It is essentially carbonated fruit juice, so it is naturally high in calories and thus comes in a small container that looks a lot like an energy drink.  I think this might confuse some, leading to negative reviews based on the wrong preconceptions of what it is meant to be.  However, I think a very valid complaint is from some that feel this "natural" drink tastes a bit artificial.  This is likely due to the use of fruit juices from concentrate, which always effects the flavor.  That, in addition to a lack of a good pronounced watermelon flavor, is why I gave this four stars.  Still, it would make a fun addition to breakfast in lieu of a similarly high calorie cup of orange juice.

review/text: This soda is lightly sweet with a touch of tartness. It comes in an 8.3 ounce can which is just about the right amount for me. It has a hint of strawberry flavor, with apple flavor predominating, and less of watermelon. It reminded me somewhat of Myers sparkling soda but with a lighter flavor.<br /><br />As a point of reference my favorite soda is Sprecher's root beer for its mellow, creamy taste, plus it uses honey and cane sugar instead of corn syrup. My least favorite soda is Coca-Cola because of its overly sweet taste, corn syrup, and caffeine.<br /><br />I would definitely try this soda again.

review/summary: Might help get a pop drinker off Caffeine
review/text: My family likes it!<br />We are kinda junk food junkies around here - in fact, my son is a cola pop addict, and I often grab one too.  That said, my son LOVED this drink, and asked for more.  It's a step up, health wise, for him, as this drink is 100% juice and offers vitamin C.<br /><br />We thought it was just the right sweet - but we are a family that likes our sweets.  The strawberry flavor was more pronounced than the watermelon in this drink, but it was a good blend.  I'd say it is about as sweet as Juicy Juice, to give you an idea.<br /><br />It was very fizzy, offering a pop drinker that just right 'burn'. I can especially seeing this being a drink to grab before bed, as it gives the soda pop satisfaction, but has no caffeine. It's a bit pricey, but I'll be looking for specials on this for sure.<br /><br />I'd be careful giving it to a child that was overweight though.  It is pretty high in calories and could contribute to a weight problem.  My son is so active, he needs the calories.

review/summary: Surprisingly tasty!
review/text: I wasn't sure how I'd like this drink. I expected something overly sweet, too sugary tasting, somehow, but was pleasantly surprised. My favorite soda is gingerale, and I like all juices apart from mango and blackcurrent.I love lemonade and limeade, and have a wicked sweet tooth when it comes to candy- more gummys and sour things than chocolate. I prefer the taste of diet coke over regular coke, and though I enjoyed them as a kid, things like grape or orange soda make me cringe now. So now you know a little about my taste (in case you relate)- now for the Switch.<br /><br />First, it seems there really isn't any actual sugar in it, which is a nice change. The taste is strong and sweet, but not too overpowering, and the carbonation is just right. I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would, and will be drinking it again in the future. The can size is smaller than expected- at my house, I have short (old fashioned) and tall (high ball) drinking glasses, and this can filled a highball glass, with no ice (from the fridge). I like sweet, and this was sweet, but not sugary tasting. If you like carbonated juice, you'll probably really enjoy these!

review/summary: This is tasty and better for you than a soda, but
review/text: The calories in this 8.3 ounce can is the same as in a 12 oz. Coke.  Basically the same result for carbs.  So, this is not what you would use if you are on a diet.  However, the sugar in the Coke is all high fructose corn syrup, while Switch uses fruit juice-natural sugar.  There is also far less sodium in this drink than a soda.<br /><br />As for taste, it uses carbonated water to give more of a kick to the fruit drink.  I liked it, my wife and teenage daughter liked it more.  Our 2 younger children were disappointed because it didn't taste like a soda or straight juice.  So, we compromised on a 4 star review.  Overall, I will buy more and of different flavors.

review/summary: Decent on the taste buds but high in calories and poor value
review/text: I received this product as part of the Amazon Vine program. I am not a fan of soda pop. Carbonated beveraged do not agree with me. Happily, this product is very lightly carbonated and I was able to tolerate it. In my opinion here are the pros and cons to this product:<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. I like the relatively small size (8.3 ounces). Often a standard 12 ounce beverage is just too much for me.<br />2. Taste: It did taste "okay". It is essentially juice with mild carbonation added. There is no sugar added but I still thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste buds. I do not have a "sweet tooth" and even with Orange Juice, I normally cut it with 50% water to reduce sweetness and calories.<br />3. Low sodium content: Only 15 mgs of sodium.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.Cost: I see these are selling at Amazon for a little under a [...] per can. The cold beverage market is fiercly competitive and I find Costco's Kirkland brand of Vita Rain to be an incredibly superior value at about [...] for a 20 ounce portion and it has a replacable cap so if you don't drink it all you can save the rest. Granted, this is not a completely fair comparison but we are in general talking about the cold beverage market.<br /><br />2. Caloric content: This is 140 calories for 8.3 ounces. If you get hooked on this beverage you'd better buy pants with expandable waistbands. Comparably, most orange juice (e.g., Tropicana and/or Odwalla) is 110 calories for 8 ounces. So, compared to OJ this is "Loaded" with calories, 100% of which come from 36 grams of carbohydrates, of which 35 grams are sugar, even though this is a "no sugar added" product.<br /><br />Summary: No doubt some people will love this product and others will find it too sweet. You might also like the light carbonation versus a standard soda pop. Only those people who are okay spending [...] day on Lattes are going to be okay with the cost of this product as a staple in their home. Other than the convenient small packaging size I would have no reason to purchase this product. I'm older now and retired and my kids are grown and gone. Back in the day when we would all hop in the mini van for a road trip I could see a use for this product. We used to carry along those little juice boxes that came with the straws and you'd poke a hole in the top. This beverage might be a little more fun for kids because it is lightly carbonated and, since it's juice, it gets a bit of a nod over punch or soda from a health standpoint. If you can get a free sample it's worth the try. I will not be buying this product.

review/text: This is a mix of apple, grape, strawberry, watermelon, and acerola juices.<br /><br />Taste is obviously subjective and that can be seen in the reviews. I like the flavor but will try to describe it rather than raving or ranting about it.<br /><br />The strawberry is the dominant flavor when drinking but the watermelon is the most persistent flavor and remains as an aftertaste. The apple is clearly there as well so the watermelon kind of comes off as a sour-apple taste. It is very sweet, more so than I would typically like in a refreshing drink.<br /><br />100% vitamin C but not much else. 35 grams of sugar and 140 calories. 100% juice but juice is mostly sugar.

I really enjoyed the Watermelon Strawberry flavor which is like taking a big bite of watermelon with a small hint of strawberry to finish it off. It's cool and refreshing and a great thirst quencher.

review/text: This little carbonated juice product is pretty tasty.  "The Switch" is 100% fruit juice combined with filtered sparkling water.  The 8.3 oz can contains 100% of daily vitamin C and 140 calories (along with 36 g of total carbs).<br /><br />The watermelon strawberry can be identified as such to the taste, but it's also pretty clear the can contains some apple juice as well.  A look at the label confirms this and also indicates grape and acerola (whatever that is).  The carbonation isn't overpowering and The Switch tastes more like juice than a carbonated soda.  The only complaint is the sweetness--the natural fruit juices do provide quite a sugary punch.  Overall, pretty tasty, but very sweet.  As an added bonus, there are no added colors and it's gluten free.

review/text: Much like the founder (Mike Gilbert) of the company that now makes "The Switch" beverages, at our house we don't like soda for all its sugar or high fructose corn syrup or iffy sweetening chemicals. We like juice, but we miss the bubbles (and also juice can get a bit expensive when you buy the kind without all the sugar, HFCS, and brain-destroying chemicals). We mix out 100% juice with fizzy water.<br /><br />The Switch Beverage Company does this for you. :-) This flavor (the only one I have tried so far) is closer to strawberry flavour than watermelon, but that's fine. It's fizzy and not too sweet.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a criticism it would be that the can is too small--why not 12 oz. for a buck? But if you are looking for a healthy sweet bubbly beverage that has a vitamin or two without additives. Here is a good one for you!

review/summary: A Fruitful Product
review/text: I'm a sucker for fruity drinks but they're usually full of high fructose corn syrup or artificial sweeteners. Since I avoid the former and hate the latter, I generally stick to black iced tea, only occasionally indulging in a bottle of kiwi-strawberry or other tasty drink that makes sweet love to my taste buds.<br /><br />New Switch lightly carbonated juice contains, as the label promises, "100% of what you want - 0% of what you don't." I had to try it, and most importantly I had to try my favorite flavor - watermelon. Rarely does watermelon translate well into a juice, but Switch Watermelon and Strawberry is perfection.  While I generally prefer non-carbonated juice, this is an exception.<br /><br />I sipped it skeptically, then practically gulped it down. I was thirsty and it was refreshing and light.  I'll be purchasing more of this drink and trying other flavors as well. My only complaint?  I'd like a bigger can! (The 8.3 oz can has 40 calories. There are 35 grams of sugar, but it's all from the fruit -- and it's delightfully sweet.)

review/text: I tried the black cherry switch and was not impressed. I thought I would give it one more try and give this flavor a chance. It's better, but still not something I can get excited about. The watermelon strawberry flavor is faint enough to where it is almost overpowered by the carbonation. If you want the taste of a fruit drink with the healthiness of fruit juice, this may be a good option for you. It was an unimpressive option for me.

review/summary: It may be carbonated 100% natural juice but . . .
review/text: As a kid I grew up picking and eating my own oranges, mangoes, bananas, watermelon other tropical fruits.  I know what 100% natural fruit and juice tastes like.  This product does not taste natural.  If watermelon flavor had been absent I don't think I could differentiate this product from a strawberry soda you can get from any vending machine.  Moreover I am not crazy about carbonated drinks considering the current discussion about certain negative side effects that may be caused by carbonation in general.  You really can't put fresh fruit in a canned drink.  For those of you who are interested in a nutritious fruit drink that is good for you, take some frozen grapes, strawberries or cherries and put them in a smoothie blender.  Add some grape juice, apple juice, cranberry juice or whatever you have (that is 100% fruit product), some pineapple (if you like), a banana (if you want some thickness) and some ice.  Blend and then pour in a nice ice cold glass and enjoy!  Now this is 100% naturally good for you.  Nice try Switch - but I'd rather switch.

review/summary: 100% natural, but... - A Switch watermelon strawberry soda review
review/text: I received a can of the Switch watermelon strawberry soda through the Amazon Vine program.  The can, slim with a normal soda can height, contains 8.3 oz.  The ingredient listing shows mostly fruit concentrates. Plus the packaging is enticing with all its promises of a healthy alternative.<br /><br />This may be a natural soda, but it tastes like an artificially sweetened diet soda.  The combination of juice to carbonation is good, but the watermelon strawberry flavor is overwhelmed with sweetness.<br /><br />I compared the nutritional label to a can of Coke and Dr. Pepper.  Even though these are not considered healthy alternatives, Coke and Dr. Pepper both have about 27g of sugar per 8oz serving.  At 35g per 8.3oz serving, the Switch soda has about 8 more grams of sugar.  With this difference, it's not difficult to see why it tastes so sweet.<br /><br />I wouldn't drink another of these.  I couldn't even finish this one, it's far too sweet.<br /><br />PROS:<br />100% natural<br />No preservatives or artificial colors<br />No sugar added<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sickenly sweet<br />Tastes artificial<br />High sugar content

review/summary: The New 7UP?
review/text: When I was young my mother would give me a eight ounce glass of 7UP whenever I had an upset stomach.  Although I never knew why, for some reason the 7UP always worked.  I decided that the reason must be either the lemon lime flavor or the carbonization.  Since lemon lime juice did not provide the same effect, I decided it must have been the carbonization.<br /><br />As a disabled person I have become sensitive to diet, and my dietician suggests I drink a glass of juice regularly.  So normally I drink a glass of apple or prune juice.  When I discovered Switch which claimed to be carbonated juice, I decided to test it to see if I could get the benefits of 7UP and juice in the same drink.<br /><br />First I noted the ingredients of Switch.  This drink, which claims to be 100 percent juice, lists ingredients in the following order:  grape, apple, acerola, strawberry, watermelon juice concentrates; natural flavors, ascorbic acid (vitamin c).  Acerola is a cherry very high in vitamin C.  Considering that strawberry is listed fourth and watermelon fifth, maybe the drink would be better named grape apple.<br /><br />Comparing this "watermelon strawberry" drink to 2 other juices, revealed to me the following information on several key factors:<br />Sodium:  Switch has 15 mg vs 25 for apple and 30 for prune.<br />Carbohydrates: Switch has 26g vs 29 for apple and 43 for prune.<br />Sugar: Switch has 26 g vs 26 for apple and 24 for prune.<br />Calories: Switch has 140 cal vs 120 for apple and 180 for prune.<br />On that comparison I choose Switch because of its lower sodium.<br /><br />It appears that since Switch is 100 percent juice and low in sodium, my choice must be on taste.  Upon drinking, I instantly feel the carbonization, followed by the predictable belch.  To me it tastes slightly sweet.  It doesn't taste like strawberry or watermelon, but I detect a hint of apple and cherry.  In general it is a pleasant taste.  Since Switch is better for me than soft drinks, I will purchase it to replace my mother's "cure".

review/summary: Have the gods finally heard my prayers?
review/text: what can i say that will actually be published about this splendid drink. It is carbonated sugar water. As per usuall the grape, apple juice content seems to always dominate in fruit drinks (unless they're suppose to taste like grapes or apples). The calories and carbs only seems high but in reality compared to a regular soda drink it is much worse since the quantity is greatly reduced in these drinks (Switch brand can 8.3oz regular can 12oz). They however make no pretensions of being a health drink with the exception of their pure juice declaration. All in all nothing shocking here, especially as we grow used to paying a lot for a little in todays economy.

review/summary: Weak, watery taste.
review/text: I feel duped when the front label proclaims "100% juice" and "Watermelon Strawberry" and then the small print says that it is mainly apple, grape, and acerola juices.<br /><br />And the vitamin C content is not noteworthy. A decent diet has enough vitamins.<br /><br />So, why bother with it except for the taste? Well, the taste is weak, like there's too much "filler" juices and not enough of what's advertised. And the (sour) strawberry taste completely overshadows the watermelon--you'd never know there was any watermelon there.<br /><br />It wasn't so terrible that I didn't drink it--unlike other Switch drinks, of which one sip was more than I could stand--but I'll never buy it again.

review/summary: Not overly sweet, but not great tasting either
review/text: I reviewed a different flavour- the Kiwi Berry, which was pretty nasty. This Watermelon Strawberry faired a bit better. It wasn't cavity sweet, but it wasn't entirely pleasant either. I actually managed to finish the can. It is slightly carbonated, not nearly as much as regular soda, so I didn't mind it, and has 100% Vitamin C which is good. I'm not sure if I would recommend this product, or this line of products. Even those who like soda may not like something like this because of the false sweetness factor and those who live on water may not appreciate this new type of drink either-I certainly don't. I certainly don't think the price is worth it. Not even close.

review/text: Ok, here is my Vine Review of this product. It is only 8 ounces, so the can is small. I pictured it being the size of one of those Arizona Tea Drinks in the big can for .99 cents. Anyway, the can says Watermelon Strawberry, but when you read the side panel you will see that they add the usual Grape and Apple to water it down. The mixture is a little syrupie and does not really taste like natural Strawberry-Watermelon at all. The carbination is minimal, almost like it was a flat soda. Now to the good part! The little 8 oz can has a whopping 140 calories, 36 carbs and 35g of sugar. Not a good drink if you are a diabetic or are trying to lose weight. I was not impressed with the product at all.

You can see a few languid bubbles when you pour it in the glass, but it's nothing you notice in the drinking.  It's at least twice as sweet as Kool-aid and every bit as fizzy. You could cut it with about 2/3 soda water and it might bring the sugar down and the fizz up to an appropriate level for adult consumption. Now that I think of it, I wish I had tried that--it's more a flavored syrup than an actual beverage.

review/summary: Costs Like an Organic, Tastes Like a Generic (Another Redneck Perspective)
review/text: Once again, in an effort to appease my hippy lady friend I tried some "all-natural" crap since my Diet Cherry Vanilla Dr. Pepper didn't have enough natural ingredients.  She convinced me to buy a 24-pack of Switch Watermelon Strawberry soda, which cost me more than 5x as much money as my non-eco and non-zen-friendly Code Red.  I've purchased 24-packs of Budweiser that were cheaper and they came in 12-oz cans and not this dinky 9oz.<br /><br />And then there's the size issue.  Now, I'm told size doesn't matter (although, I'm convinced she lied) but I do feel like I'm coming up short when I'm faced with a 9oz as opposed to a regular 12oz.  This is especially true given the price.  It also fails to recognize my manhood, such as it is, when I'm grasping a can smaller than a Red Bull and it doesn't even give me wings.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed, when I opened the can, was the pleasant aroma remiscent of... Old Orchard?  I cracked open the first one while driving in my truck and my good buddy Drewfus sitting next to me took a sniff, looked over and asked, "is that a soda or are you drinking apple juice?"  The scent was that pungent.<br /><br />As if to add insult to injury, I took my first swig.  The first thing I noticed was the high sugar content almost akin to a Monster drink.  To confirm this, I later examined the can (before properly disposing it at the shooting range) to discover Switch had more sugar than a regular coke and nearly as much as Dr. Pepper.  This is insane as it has more sugar content than an already sugar-filled drink that has three more ounces on it.<br /><br />The next thing I noticed in the taste was a very familiar element.  Almost as if I had tasted this before during my sober days.  Later, I found myself drinking a generic Shasta kiwi-strawberry soda I obtained from the local grocery store (Western Family equivilent for West Coast and Sam's for you Wal-Mart shoppers) and then it hit me, it tasted just like Switch.  I quickly grabbed another Switch can and compared; the tastes were nearly identical.<br /><br />So, what can I possibly get out of spending as much money for a 24-pack as I would for a Blu-Ray DVD that tastes like a generic?  Maybe feel greener since I drank something that I think came from environmentally friendly alluminum similar to environmentally friendly acid from hybrid car batteries.  It still tasted nice, but I felt seriously ripped off given the price.  I certainly was motivated to get more Busch Light since I seem to get more bang for my buck that way, which says A LOT.

There wasn't really any carbonation either. With the lack of a great flavor and at 140 Calories for this tiny little can of 8.3 ounces with 36 grams of carbs and 35 grams of sugar (albeit natural fruit sugars), I'd rather have a glass of water.  It's wonderful that they do not use any added sugars or corn syrup or preservatives but the flavor and calorie count of this drink just does not justify consuming it.  Then you have to consider the high cost to buy it.....  . NO....I will not be buying this drink EVER again!  The concept of it is marvelous but the follow through...not good!!

It is 100% pure watermelon and strawberry juice and the difference from the regular sodas is quite obvious. Right from the first sip it feels richer and tastier than any soda product out there. After drinking it, you may never go back to regular sodas again. It works well by itself or with a meal. This may be an ideal substitute for sodas for kids, as it is a much more nutritious drink. The only problem that I have is the size of the can. At 8.3 ounces it may be enough for a kid, but you would need more than one of these to quench an adult's thirst.

Watermelon Strawberry was second, and Black Cherry was a distant third.<br /><br />This product has a lot going for it, in my opinion.  100% fruit juice, so healthier than soda, but with added carbonation to make it different than just plain juice.

The serving size is good, too.<br /><br />I do wish that it was available in larger sizes, even if someone didn't want to drink it all at once.<br /><br />My rating for the flavors, based solely on my personal opinion, is:<br />Kiwi Berry:  5 stars - would buy again<br />Watermelon Strawberry:  4 stars - would drink again, but probably won't buy again<br />Black Cherry:  3 stars - would drink again if very thirsty, but wouldn't go out of my way to get it

review/summary: Sweet and Metallic
review/text: Overall, I was not thrilled with the taste of this product.  At first the watermelon and strawberry did come through pretty clearly, and that was a good sensation. But following very quickly was a distinctly light, thin metallic taste, and this taste lingered well after.  It wasn't the iron-specific taste of metal you'd get from blood, or even the filtered metallic taste you might get from eating liver, but more the metallic taste you get from water steeped in a porous metallic tankard.  It wasn't so bad that I spit the product out, but most definitely noticeable.<br /><br />You've got 140 calories in 8.3 ounces.  Yes, there is no added sugar, but there's more than enough of it in the concentrated juices which make up the product.  I usually drink diet, so am used to beverages packing less than a calorie.  The sweetness came through most clearly.<br /><br />They play up the carbonation on the packaging, but the carbonation was nowhere near the level of your typical carbonated cola.  The carbonation was rather light, with very little fizz, pleasant and mild.<br /><br />I note the presence of acerola, again.  I saw this in my trial acai beverage, too.<br /><br />Bottom line: Thanks, Amazon, for yet another free drink.  It wasn't bad, not at all, it was only okay, and not something that I'd seek out or spend any of my own money to purchase.

As far as a carbonated juice goes I have no problem drinking it and I suppose for a buck per can it is pretty much the same as a juice box only at 8.3 ounces a little bigger - and since it's fizzy, a lot more fun.<br /><br />Just one thing.<br /><br />I noticed that the can reads: "Switch - 100% of what you want. 0% of what you don't."<br />This might be a bit of a puzzle because when I turned the can around I read that one 8.3 ounce serving is 140 calories with 35 grams of sugar. That seemed like a lot so I compared this to a 12 ounce can of Mountain Dew and a 12 ounce can of Coca Cola & this is what I got:<br /><br />Switch:  140 cal  16.86 cal. per oz  35g sugar  4.21 sugar per oz<br />Mnt. Dew:  170 cal  14.16 cal. per oz  46g sugar  3.83 sugar per oz<br />Coca Cola:  140 cal  11.67 cal. per oz  39g sugar  3.25 sugar per oz<br /><br />Overall there are more calories/sugar per ounce of the Switch than there is in sodas so I guess I'm wondering what the "0%" is of what I don't want is because, quite frankly I would rather have the cola. It tastes better and is evidently better for me.

review/summary: Great taste... but what are you "really" looking for?
review/text: I love the taste of this soda alternative; however I'm left with a bit of confusion.  I would love to have a healthier alternative to soda, one that provides the vitamins and nutrition of fruit juice, but not at the cost of more calories.  And therein lies the problem, I don't want to have to pay for the nutrients by accepting more calories.  And The Switch has even more calories than regular soda.<br /><br />Perhaps it all depends on what your definition of healthy is, or how well your metabolism is tuned.  If you value a natural, vitamin-robust drink that does not have those nasty artificial ingredients - AND you can burn off the 140 calories - then great, this is a nice choice.  For me, calorie count is the first thing I look at, and the only way to keep that down is to use those otherwise nasty artificial ingredients or just squeeze a fresh lemon wedge into a glass of water.

review/summary: Holy cow sugar rush!
review/text: I thought this was going to be a pretty good drink considering it advertises itself as No sugar added and no perservatives. Plus all of the ingredients are suppose to be natural. Upon opening the drink, one sniff and all I could smell is a very sugary smell.<br /><br />I took a drink and yup, sugar galore. I am now hopped on sugars and I have given up on Pepsi because of the amount of sugar in that. Sadly, this tastes even more sweet than Pepsi. I decided to take a look at the nutrition facts in hopes that it really wasn't as sweet as I thought it was.<br /><br />It has 35GRAMS of sugar in this 8.3 Fl Oz can. Whoa. That's more sugar than some soft drinks. Granted, it is suppose to have all natural ingredients but none of it seems that way. It tastes like watermelon and strawberry as it advertises but more like liquid candy versions of the two tastes. It might be OK to drink this every once in a while but not for everyday, especially when it is mostly just drinking sugar liquid candy. If I had kids, I would not give this to them as they may be way too hyper to handle after this drink. Heck, I don't even think I should have had that to drink after only drinking iced tea and water for the last few weeks.

review/summary: Perfect Blend of Fruit Flavors With the Right Amount of Tartness and Sweetness
review/text: This is the most awesome drink ever.  I love bubbly drinks, but do not drink sodas due to the unhealthiness of them.  I sometimes drink bubbly water as a treat.  This drink is perfect.  It is bubbly, but not unhealthy.  It is 100% fruit juice.  It is not sticky, but has just the right amount of sweetness and tanginess.<br /><br />And the flavor is delectabale.  It is the perfect blend of fruit juices.  I love fresh watermelons, but when it comes to watermelon flavor, I don't like it to be very strong.  That's why I love this drink - there is only a hint of watermelon flavor.  The strawberry flavor is a little stronger.  But all together, the flavors are a perfect blend.  It can't get any better than this.

review/text: For some reason when I ordered this I thought I was getting a case and not just one can.  Reading is fundamental right? :-) Anyway, I loved the watermelon-strawberry taste but I didn't expect it to be so "carbonated".  I don't think it has any carbonation in it but it has that "feel" as I was drinking it.  Lose that (whatever it is) and you'd have a really good drink.  I'm not that big into all the "low calorie, low fat, low sugar, low salt" mumbo-jumbo.  For me that usually means "low taste and NO taste".  If a drink has that then it's a bonus, but for me it's not a requirement.

review/text: This isn't bad, but it's too sweet for me. I think it'd be good as a mixer of frozen drink though (or frozen drink mixer!). It is nice that it's 100% juice with vitamin C added. And if you do really like sweet drinks and things (I'm more of a bitter or sour fan), then you may love this. I'd recommend it for fans of Strawberry soda who are looking for something healthier. Unless trying it as a mixer, I wouldn't get it again.<br /><br />I actually ordered the Black Cherry version of this too, so we'll see if I like that better. Oh - and for the people who said it tastes like a Jolly Rancher. I think they're just being general. It tastes nothing like a watermelon Jolly Rancher. The strawberry flavor stands out more to me (is there a strawberry Jolly Rancher?).<br /><br />Also - weird name for a soda.

review/text: As an 'Organic' soda, I expected more of a vitamin taste from The Switch.  I'm happy to report that there is no such flavor or aftertaste.  Both the watermelon and strawberry flavors really stand out separately in the drink.  It's got the watery/refreshing make-up of watermelon juice, with a slight tartness from the strawberry.<br /><br />The closest thing I can think of to compare it to is a cherry 7-up type drink, but with watermelon and strawberry.  With maybe a less carbonated Sparkling Cider texture. Very refreshing, but at nearly a dollar for 8 oz, it's much more expensive than your typical soda.

I tried two flavors: this strawberry watermelon, and the orange tangerine . I preferred the orange one. This didn't really taste "watermelon strawberry" to me. There's a LOT of juices mixed in, a made the flavor "muddy." I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter (and, I think, more carbonated). But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!

review/text: Switch is a sweet, natural fruit juice beverage to enjoy as an alternative to traditional sodas, providing the same carbonated drink experience only with no sugar, corn syrup, preservatives, glutens or artificial colors.<br /><br />This just might mix up pretty well in a cocktail, too!<br /><br />Switch tastes nice but not overwhelmingly sweet. It leaves a light, temporary, watermelon-flavored carbonated drink aftertaste.<br /><br />If you guzzle down sodas left and right, I recommend you at least give Switch a try - it's "healthier" (or so it appears) and it's cool, bubbly-crisp and refreshing.

review/summary: A Great, More Healthy Alternative to Soda Pop
review/text: I love carbonated drinks. Coke, Pepsi, Red Pop, Creme Soda... I think what makes me prefer them is the carbonation. Somehow, it makes me slow down and enjoy the drink more.<br /><br />However, most soft drink companies are just creating different flavors of high fructose corn syrup mixed with the carbonated water. I don't like that. There's nothing good or healthy about HFCS, and I get enough of it in the various foods I purchase without having to drink several ounces of it every day.<br /><br />This product, The Switch, is a great alternative to regular soft drinks. It's basically just carbonated fruit juice with some preservatives added. It gives me that zing I like in carbonated drinks, but without any of the high fructose corn syrup (of course fruit juice has its own sugars). It's much healthier and tastes great.<br /><br />That's what's good about this item. The only bad thing I can think of is that the cans are TINY. I'm sorry; I'm an adult male, and I can't be satisfied with an 8.3 ounce can of juice. Two cans is about right, and at the price they're asking, that's about a dollar and ninety cents to get close to the quantity of a typical bottle of soda pop (20 ounces). Is it worth the upgrade? Yeah, I guess so, but I would think it would make a 24-pack go quickly in my case. I really wish they'd just package them in 16.6 ounce containers, and then still sell as a 24-pack.<br /><br />This flavor, Watermelon Strawberry, is my favorite of theirs so far. I love strawberry, and the watermelon just adds a hint of sweetness to it. I wish they (and other companies) would produce a drink that is JUST strawberry, but it seems like that's out of reach (maybe due to price) and so they mix strawberry juice with something else. In most cases, that "something else" is kiwi fruit, which I do not like very much. With this beverage, they skipped the kiwi and chose something that I feel is much more of a compliment to the taste of strawberries; Watermelon.<br /><br />All told, I'd have to recommend this product if you want a fizzy drink without the crud you find in most other soft drinks. This is at least real fruit juice, and while I can't say that carbonated drinks of any kind are "good for you", I can at least say that this one is made with good intentions and won't make you feel like you're bloated after downing a couple of them. I'm going to "subscribe" to one of their products soon, just to see if I can notice a change in my weight, energy level, and general health by switching (Hey!, See? Good product name!) to something that is a bit more natural.<br /><br />As always, your mileage may vary.

Not to worry, it turns out to have a pleasant fruity taste, not subtle but not sugary and not overly artificial.  Likewise, they got the carbonation right: it's bubbly enough to be light but not gaseous.  My one complaint?  The can's too small.

review/summary: Let's weigh the good and the bad of Switch
review/text: This product is 100% juice with no additives to speak of. That makes it natural and healthy. Good. The drink is also carbonated, which is what I like, so that is good. The can is small, so it isn't so much a thirst quenching drink as it is a dose of vitamin C in liquid form. Bad (but good). The flavor selection is exotic and quite different from typical everyday colas and flavored waters. Good. But surprisingly, this drink was quite bland and left a bitter aftertaste, possibly from the carbonation. Bad. If I could drink this on a regular basis at the same price as my usual Diet Coke or Pepsi One, I might consider going for it, but I have a feeling that it would be pricier than a typical cola. Bad. So, with three stars as the base of an average drink, we have four goods and three bads, pushing this to a middling 4 star rating. In short, it's fine but isn't anything to get excited about.

review/text: I was unimpressed with SWITCH WATERMELON/STRAWBERRY. It's just another entry into the sparkling juice market--a market that really didn't need another brand, especially not one lacking in anything new or interesting.<br /><br />Like all the other sparkling juice drinks, its flavor comes mostly from apple and grape juice concentrates; the flavors on the label are only a small part of the ingredients list. The result is that this doesn't really taste like watermelon OR strawberry.  Instead, it fits some food scientist's "flavor profile" of those two tastes, kind of watermelon-ish, kind of strawberry-ish, but lacking in both. The flavor is just not anything to shout about, and no better than the other products on the market.<br /><br />I'm also not sure why it's called SWITCH. I guess it's a marketing thing--they want people to "switch" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. Well, I know that *I* won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink.

review/text: I felt like I was drinking pure sugar.<br /><br />Which, it would seem, is exactly what I am drinking.<br /><br />It says its all natural juice with no added sugar, but the ingredient label says:<br /><br />"Filtered Sparkling Water Sufficient to Reconstitute Juice Concentrates, Grape, Apple, Acerola, Strawberry and Watermelon Juice Concentrates"<br /><br />I think they're using the old %100 juice trick where, instead of just using sugar or high fructose corn syrup, they distill all the sugars from fruit juice, so even though its no different in nutrition than cane sugar, its still technically "%100 fruit juice" giving people the impression that its healthy and that they should be okay paying way more for whats essentially sugar water.  Its mostly done for product consistency, so every package of juice tastes the same, but its still somewhat deceiving to let people think they're buying juice when all they're getting is the sugar that was originally in the juice.<br /><br />This trick is commonly done with apple and grape juice concentrates, which are the first two listed as being reconstituted.  I can't say for sure that this is what this company is doing, but I wouldn't be surprised, its more common than you'd think.<br /><br />So, yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm drinking soda with regular sugar in it.  35 grams of sugar in an 8 ounce can?  If anything, that sounds WORSE than regular soda.  Oh, and its a dollar a can?  And the cans are only 2/3rds the size of a normal soda can?<br /><br />To me that doesn't sound like a good alternative to soda.<br /><br />The flavor isn't bad, but its waaaaay too sweet, like I'm drinking candy.  While using a better kind of sugar than high fructose corn syrup DOES make it a better quality soda, I'd still rather buy a cane sugar soda like Jones instead.  It tastes great AND it doesn't masquerade as a health drink either.

review/summary: Nothing Special
review/text: I started drinking carbonated juice to replace energy drink because I mostly drank energy drinks for the taste, not the caffiene.  In that regard, carbonated juice drinks are a great substitute for replacing energy drinks if half of the reason you drank them was taste, like it was for me.  Otherwise a drink of this nature may not be right for you because it is loaded with more calories than a soda.  I drink grape juice on a regular basis which has (depending on the grape juice) about 40 grams of sugar and 170 calories, so in that regard this product is better.  haha  If you are a weight conscious person you just have to remember that juive has just as much, if not more, sugar than soda and is equally bad for your teeth.  The main difference between these types of drinks and regular soda is that the sugar is natural rather than process, which actually does make quite a difference because white sugar is well-known to cause weight gain, and I drink a lot of juice, and I lost weight because it actually cut my cravings.<br /><br />  So in terms of the taste of this product it was definitely a matter of taste.  The strawberry is a little bit overpowering, but if you like strawberry so, it probably wont bother you, the watermelon wasn't quite as strong, and if you are expecting this to be pure watermelon and strawberry juice forget it.  Like most sdrinks of this nature this is maybe %5 of the most expensive juice to produce and the rest is filler juice, ei apple and grape.  In defense of this product and other of this nature, I'm not sure pure watermelon and strawberry juice would actually taste good.<br /><br />  The carbonation in it was definitely lacking.  I prefer the Izze sparkling juice because they are very fizzy and not really sweet at all, they really do taste like pure carbonated juice, whereas this stuff taste like they boiled down the juice to maximize the sugar potency and mixed it in with a little carbonated water; its just not that good.<br /><br />  So it may be natural and slightly more healthy, but it wont make you lose you weight and it doesn't taste good enough to stave off any sugar craving, you run straight for a can of coke after this.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amy

I believe this kind of marketing is unethical, since it suggests you are getting a can of strawberry and watermelon juice.  Far from it.  You are getting a whole lot of marketing in a can, and it isn't that great.  Save your money.

review/text: This stuff comes in the shape of a typical red bull can and tastes like strawberry soda mixed with red bull.  I drank this stuff not knowing whether it had caffeine in it.  The label did not say anything, so I did not know what to think.  So as a test I took it at my usual bedtime.  It didn't keep me up for more than 10 minutes.  I am normally very intolerant to caffeine.  Since I hardly ever drink it, a normal soda can keep me jittery for a couple hours - a red bull for about half a day - this product did not seem to get me jittery at all.  So my verdict: tastes bad and no caffeine effect.

review/text: The drink is okay.  Unfortunately, the can was dirty when I got it, and was a little smaller than I envisioned.  Notwithstanding, it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some "juice" drinks have, yet it wasn't anything super.

review/summary: delicious drink
review/text: This is a great flavored drink. Although it tastes sweet, and contains 35g sugar, and it is 140 calories per serving, it contains no added sugars. Contains 100% juice and vitamin C, it's gluten free, no corn syrup, and no artifical colors. This drink is carbonated, so if you like carbonated juice drinks this drink if for you. I tried the watermelon strawberry drink and it was really good. I mostly could taste the strawberry part of it, and barely tasted the watermelon flavor. Although this drink is sweeter than I'm used to, I thought it was really tasty. I would drink this drink again if given the opportunity. Thanks for the free sample!

review/summary: Big Enjoyment! :)  Tiny Can!  :(
review/text: Basically, this is carbonated fruit juice, no added sugars.  I was concerned that it might be a bit too sweet for me, so I poured it over some ice and found that the resulting beverage was just right once the ice had melted a little.  The first taste I noticed was the sweet juiciness of the watermelon, followed by the tang of strawberry as the drink went down.  The carbonation gave everything an overall sprightliness that I really enjoyed.  Sadly, my enjoyment was short-lived, because this watermelon/strawberry drink went down all too fast.  Each can has only 8.3 ounces of tongue-tingling deliciousness, leaving me wanting more.  Sigh.

review/summary: Nice Idea
review/text: Switch, watermelon strawberry soda is a carbonated soda which is sweetened with fruit juice rather than corn syrup. This flavor is watermelon strawberry and we found it quite refreshing. I thought the can looked quite snazzy and well designed but wondered if its tall narrow can might get it mistaken for an energy drink. Although this flavor is watermelon strawberry, tt tastes much like artificial strawberry soda.<br /><br />This is  a nice alternative to regular soda, but I don't see myself buying it that often. The high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach. Too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non-carbonated version.

review/summary: Received only one can of 24 pack
review/text: I got a can in the mail. Open the can and saw that the calories are from 35 grams of sugar (fruit juice) and nothing else, I thought to myself, this is all sugar melted in water and carbonated, I drank a sip and could already feel sticky in my mouth on the teeth. It's going to rot my teeth for sure and leave a sticky mouth feel. Carbonated just not like what I would call a good carbonation like soda or mountain dew. It's less carbonation than those but has as much sugar or more than a can of soda. This is just sugar water.

review/text: I'm sorry I opted for this item.  I got only one can but it apparently counts as a full case.<br />Just as well, I didn't care for the taste.  Much too sweet.

review/summary: Light, refreshing and real watermelon flavor.
review/text: I'm a watermelon snob. Lots of folks try to make watermelon beverages (or candy), but few succeed. Their products are either too sweet, not sweet enough, or redolent of artificial flavors. Not Switch. This is a great, not-too-sweet drink with a realistic, natural watermelon flavor. The only issue I have is that the size is awfully small.

review/summary: Not bad, not great
review/text: Other reviewers have noted my main concern with a  drink like this:  It is all natural (the ingredient list is refreshingly short), but at the same time that doesn't seem to make the drink any better for you.  140 calories, 36g of carbs (35 from straight sugar)... in an 8 oz can.  the upside is you get a full serving of vitamin C- but a lot of beverages can claim that.<br /><br />As for taste, I thought it was decent tasting fairly light, obviously very sweet though.  Personally, if you're going to have a high calorie drink, I'd like some kick to it.  This doesn't really do that in the slightest.  If it was offered to me again, I would drink it, but I'm not inclined to buy it.

review/summary: A Great Drink--Wonderful Twist!
review/text: I'm not a big soda drinker, but I definitely enjoy juices. After trying Switch's beverage, I was pleasantly surprised. I think I've found one of my new favorite drinks. The combination of watermelon and strawberry was wonderful. The slight amount of carbonation only added to the experience. Reminds me of a product called Apple Beer or even just adding Sprite/7up to Orange Juice. Switch has done that, but probably added some other secret ingredients.<br /><br />Not really sure what else I can really say--it's a drink, after all, but I enjoyed it and definitely will be buying the product. I'm also eager to try some of the other flavors that Switch offers. I will say that pricing wise, it looks to be a tad on the expensive side, especially for the amount you receive.

review/summary: Not impressed
review/text: I was expecting a better tasting drink for something that claims to be 100% juice.  Maybe it's the carbonation and sugar combination, but the taste was too strong and tasted like a carbonated piece of hard candy (think Jolly Rancher).  I'm not sure how healthy this drink could be considered since there are 140 calories and the drink is only 8.3 fl oz.  For that many calories, this drink has to be loaded with sugar.  Maybe the drink could be used as quick pick-me-up drink, but if you're going that route, you're probably better off buying an energy drink since the cost wouldn't be much different.  Switch drinks are about $1 a can.

review/summary: All natural, but not all that good for you...
review/text: I think the Switch is a beverage with soda replacement in mind. The can boasts it contains 100% of what one wants (being all natural, 100% juice, full daily serving of vitamin C, and the clincher, carbonated), while having 0% of what you don't want (no added sugar, corn syrup, preservatives or colors.)<br /><br />The Good - So with that in mind, I have to agree that it is refreshing to see companies trying to fill the void in "sodas" with no corn syrup, with tons of juice and vitamins to boot. I like that you get a full dose of vitamin C. As for taste, it has a nice slightly crisp bite of carbonation and it's a little heavy (read syrupy without being too sweet), but it does have a reconstituted juice base, so it gets a pass. It's also in a single serving-size can (8.3oz), which is nice considering I typically treat most 20oz bottles as a serving, even though it's 2 and a half and I tend never do the math to figure out the true content of what I'm drinking.<br /><br />The Bad - The price is a bit steep. At about a dollar a can, it's roughly twice the price as most 100% juices you can find. Whereas a 64 ounce carton of Tropicana will run you upwards of four dollars, 8 cans of the Switch would cost eight bucks. For soda lovers, the Switch is about twice the cost compared to your average 20oz bottle, and roughly 4 times the cost of cans (when comparing equal amount by the ounce.) Also, read the ingredients, it contains more apple and grape juice than watermelon or strawberry, which means that the taste is probably aided by the natural flavors (which doesn't mean oranges, just that it was derived from natural substances not chemically made.)<br /><br />The Ugly - The Switch seems straight forward, but it's also a little devious which leads me to my biggest complaint. Granted it's all natural, but each 8oz can contains 34g of carbs, 32 of sugar alone. That's more sugar than soda, in some cases by almost 10 grams a serving. More sugar (even if it's not corn syrup) is more calories per can, so even at it's single serving size you'd almost be better off drinking a Coke and taking a vitamin C pill.
