review/summary: Nice change
review/text: I would have to say that I have not been feeding my kids the best food.  I decided to see what a better quality food would do for them.  I can say that their coat which was adequate turned into long silky smooth beautiful fur.  I have 2 ragdolls.  The only downside for me is that I leave their food out for a week and feed them a can a day.  I travel and need to have them be happy with dry food alone when I am gone.  I start at kittens leaving a full bowl of food out and have a cat genie.  This way the only difference is that I am not home and they do not get their canned treat while I am away a day or 2.  The Royal Canin dries out and becomes stale after a couple days.  So if you are not a traveler and can scoop everyday, this is great.

review/summary: Like all of Bob's Red Mill Products - the best!
review/text: I use a lot of Bob's Red Mill gluten-free products because of their quality and purity. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003X35RR2">Bob's Red Mill Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour -- 24 oz</a>  Their regular prices (through Amazon.com) are good, too, better than I have been able to find anywhere else. In addition to the decent basic price, there's an extra discount if you subscribe for regular deliveries at intervals that you set up.  Because I use the white rice flour more than the brown, I have set the white rice delivery intervals at 3 months and the brown I will probably set at 4 or 5 months.  (There are different intervals, and the choice is always yours.  Additionally, if you find you are using products faster or slower than you anticipated, you can delay, cancel or request an extra delivery!  They are happy to please you!)  My first orders of each of the different items were not set up this way because I wasn't sure how fast I would use them, but as soon as I know for each product, I will set the interval for each.  This is important because I don't want to keep products too long on my pantry shelves. Also, I wouldn't have room for them. This way, I get fresh product just as I need it and save money at the same time! I LOVE Bob's Red Mill products!  And I love buying them through Amazon.com!  Can you tell??<br /><br />As an added note: if there's something  in grocery that you can't find easily or think it's just too expensive, check out Amazon.com.  Chances are very good that they will have it, and it will cost you less.

review/text: Just bought some today at the grocery store, and it was well worth the money, but please don't spend 14 dollars on it as some of these sellers are suggesting. I don't know what the sellers are thinking. You can get it a 6 pack of the 16 oz bottles for between 5 and 7 dollars.... without having to pay shipping and handling costs. You just have ti get up andngo to a supemarket lol. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good low sugar beverage. Very good for those with diabetes or just watching their sugar intake. :)

Hopefully he can ensure the store gets a steady supply.  I was hoping that I might find it here on Amazon but not at this price!  I can get 2.5 six packs for what they are asking and when on sale 3.

review/summary: Awesome Tea!
review/text: I went to CVS Pharmacy and stopped when I saw Donald Trump's face and "The Celebrity Apprentice" logo for Diet Snapple Bret's Blend Trop-A-Rocka Tea. The CVS store I went to also had regular and diet Snapple Papaya Mango Tea with "The Amazing Race" logo, with flavors inspired by India, limited time only. When I saw the words, "Limited Time Only", I grabbed two cases of Bret Michaels' Snapple drinks, two cases each of the regular and diet papaya mango teas inspired by "The Amazing Race". I gave some of these drinks to my family, friends, and co-workers, and after tasting all three Snapples, I'm very glad I bought these drinks. I think it's great that Bret Michaels helped craft & create a drink with diabetic people in mind, like himself. I'm not diabetic, but I know a lot of people who are diabetic, and I think this drink tastes great. I think it's fabulous that Bret is a spokesperson for the American Diabetes Association. Bret's naturally flavored diet tropical tea made from green & black tea leaves has a unique, sweet taste. I have watched each season of "Celebrity Apprentice", and Bret Michaels deserved to win his season. (For the current season of "Celebrity Apprentice", I think Marlee Matlin is doing a pretty good job). Besides Bret Michaels' Diet Snapple drink, I highly recommend Snapple's Papaya Mango Tea, regular and diet versions. Of course, the regular tea tastes better than the diet tea, but both are great. The regular Papaya Mango Tea tastes out of this world! I was honestly blown away by the taste. I feel that this is the best chilled bottled tea I've had in a while, besides chilled Thai tea. The Honest Tea brand, besides the Snapple brand, also has excellent bottled ades and teas. Anyways, I absolutely think you can get addicted to Snapple's Papaya Mango Tea. It's a shame that that these teas are for a "limited time only". Snapple has made "The Celebrity Apprentice" and "The Amazing Race" viewers like me dash for these drinks like the contestants on these television shows. I'm really glad that Snapple has made a drink inspired by the beautiful country of India and "The Amazing Race". I've watched the majority of "The Amazing Race" seasons, and season 17 was my favorite with the first all-female team of female physicians, Nat Strand and Kat Chang winning. My favorite team for season 18 was sadly eliminated, Ron & Christina Hsu, but congratulations to Christina for recently marrying another "The Amazing Race" contestant, Azaria Azene. Anyways, if you see both "The Celebrity Apprentice" and "The Amazing Race" Snapple drinks whenever you're out and about, don't hesitate to buy them. You won't regret it. It's awesome that Amazon customers can buy Bret Michaels' tea online for now, but it's sad that the "The Amazing Race" teas aren't as available online. Snapple's Southern Sweet Tea is also an excellent product. Again, it's too bad that they don't sell these drinks on Amazon or the Snapple website. But thumbs up to Amazon for selling Bret's Trop-A-Rocka Diet Snapple Tea. If Amazon would sell "The Amazing Race" and Southern Sweet Teas from Snapple, that would be even more fantastic! My rating is five stars for the drink, but three stars for the fact that this is being sold online for $14.95. At my local CVS pharmacy, I was able to get six bottle packs of "The Celebrity Apprentice" and "The Amazing Race" Snapple Teas for $4.99 per pack. (Basically, you can get almost three packs of this stuff at CVS Pharmacy for the amount of money being asked for this online. Then again, if you can't find this in any store near you, then I guess it's worth it to take a chance and buy this online to try these "limited edition" drinks.)

If I need 0 calories, I'll go for the diet peach or raspberry flavors. I just wish it was more widely sold. I check for it at every convenience store, and find it at about 1/4 of them.

review/text: This tea tastes very unique, with flavors I can't quite put my finger on. And that's one thing I didn't like about it - why don't they tell us what flavors are in here? The only hint I saw was the image of fruits which I couldn't quite identify (and a stick of cinnamon) on the front of the bottle. I can definitely taste the cinnamon. Anyway, I do enjoy the taste and I'm glad I purchased. It's caffeine free even though it's made from tea leaves (not sure how that works?). It's a good thing to support such a positive product, since it states that it's made for diabetics.

review/summary: Decent treats according to my tasters
review/text: These are good treats, small and crunchy.  Unfortunately the packaging is defective.  We have bought at least 10 or more packages over the last 6 months and none of them can be resealed.  They have the zip strip but it does not work.  When we first open the bag the cats gobble them down but turn their noses up at them when the bag gets about 1/2 used. We have tried sealing with a clip and that has helped though the more finicky cat still will not eat these treats after the bag has been open for a few days.<br /><br />eta-Note that this review is for bags of treats.  They keep substituting the canister picture which probably closes fine.

review/text: I bought this product based on online reviews.  I was disappointed that I paid twice as much for this litter than other name brands.  I didn't find that it clumped any better (actually not as good). I found that it was a lot messier than others because if you've ever seen how sawdust spreads you'll know what I am talking about.  I didn't find this cat litter to be better than any of the others I have tried in any way and after reading another review that said it was horse bedding pellets that could be bought at a feed store for $7 for a 40 lb bagged I feel like a sucker.

review/summary: No smell :)
review/text: I've been using this litter with my rescue kitty. (She showed up at my door one day pregnant, and I, like a sap, gave her some food. The very next day she came into the house and started yowling to be fed again!)<br /><br />You basically have to stick your nose IN the litter box to smell anything, which is a huge plus in my book. Less smell!<br /><br />Now, I do want to address some of the complaints you see in the reviews here.<br /><br />First, people saying "We switched to this, and my cat wouldn't use it, and it was a disaster".<br /><br />Well, cats can be very picky about changes. If your cat is used to a particular type of litter, he or she is not going to want to switch on your say-so. And that doesn't matter what brand they're used to or what you're switching to! A cat raised and litter trained on pine litter would react as badly to being made to use clay litter all of a sudden! Whenever you switch things around with your cat, you have to do it carefully. Put a tiny amount of the new litter on the bottom of the box, and the old litter on top. Then you gradually change the proportions until you're using a tiny amount of the old litter and it's almost all the new litter. (Some people stay at this stage forever. If you have a very old, set-in-his-ways cat that may be best.)<br /><br />So when people say "Oh, my cat didn't know what to do!", I don't take that very seriously unless they tried to gradually transition their cat.<br /><br />Another thing people have mentioned is that they find the poop doesn't get covered. This, to me, is a matter of hygiene. You should really be removing the poop every day, no matter what type of litter you use. If you don't wish to do that, though, you should use a different type of kitty litter. This one isn't going to work for you.<br /><br />The third thing is that some people have trouble cleaning it. The instructions on the bag say to shake the box so the old, used litter goes to the bottom and the top is fresh pellets. Then you dump it all out when the pellets have mostly been used up. You can do that. I've been changing mine more frequently because our darling IS a little picky (only cat I know who prefers to go out to do her business and then comes back in just like a dog) and what I do is scoop it up and then shake it into the garbage bag. The used stuff stays in the scoop long enough to move over the trash bag, and then when I shake it it drops down. I haven't had trouble cleaning the box.<br /><br />Now, with that said, it's not for everyone. For one thing, there are plenty of cats who, raised on clay litter, will find this one uncomfortable and awkward to use. But if your cat is very young or more flexible you should definitely look into this.

review/summary: Best Litter I have been able to find
review/text: After looking at all the various litter options (environmentally friendly, scented, scent-free, odor reducing...) I think this is the best litter I've found by a large margin. I live in a small space (1000 sq ft) and the litter box is in the guest bathroom meaning that people are constantly exposed to it. This litter does smell a little "woodsy" but overall it reduces smells, lasts longer (with a little scooping) and is cheaper on average than most. It also (very importantly) tracks a lot less than other litters I've used.<br /><br />Highlights: tracks less than other litters, reduces odors more naturally, uses less litter than other brands<br /><br />Downsides: "woodsy" smell

It is cost efficient and adds a wonderful fresh pine smell to the litter box.  It is easy to maintain the cleanliness of the litter box and helps keep it dry and inviting for your cats. I have 4 cats and they never had any problem adjusting to the addition of Feline Pine Litter to their box. Overall, this is an excellent product that I highly recommend for daily use. I purchase my bags through the monthly automatic delivery Amazon provides. It is such a pleasure not to have the worry about the availability at the local store and the convenience of having it delivered to my front door.

review/summary: 4 cats, Lasts over a month
review/text: I've used all kinds of litter, clay, wheat, corn, and was never satisfied with any of them. I have a cat that always preferred doing her business outside of the box, until I got this litter. I didn't do any break in period, but I did have two litter boxes, one with the old litter, and one with feline pine.. they would use both equally, so when I ran out of the old stuff, I just filled it up with feline pine, and the cats don't even care. We have 4 cats, so I keep the two boxes in different rooms, to give them a "choice" of where they want to go.<br /><br />It DOES take a little more maintenance. It does not smell like cat urine at all, but you will smell poop, so you will want to clean that out daily, I do it twice a day if I need to, but usually just once a day. One a week, you need to sift all the dust out. I purchased a metal mesh grid off of amazon that works great [...] It cost $4. I scoop the litter onto the mesh, and shake it around over a box, then dump the pellets back into the litter box.. takes me about 15 minutes to do two big boxes.<br /><br />One day when I was at Home Depot to do some screen repair, they had a premade sliding aluminum screen, that costed $5, which might work well also.<br /><br />The litter itself lasts forever... I would say more than month with proper care.. and I have 4 cats.<br /><br />Another thing you might want to consider is changing their diet. At first, their poop would be a little on the soft side, which is difficult to clean, but I switched to Blue Buffalo Wilderness Chicken ([...]) which has no grain, and my cats poop is on the harder side, it doesnt smell (much).. and my cats are all around healthier and a lot more active.<br /><br />At first, you could really smell the pine.. it was a little over powering to be honest, but not in a bad way. I just had some friends over this past weekend, and I asked if our house smelled weird.. and they all said no... they were drunk, so I know they were telling the truth.

review/summary: The only litter I use...
review/text: and both of my cats give it a high five!  I love being a cat mom, but hated traditional cat litter... the smell, the mess, and the removal.  Frustrated and searching for a greener path, I discovered Feline Pine.  Now I have no problems with litter box odor and once the poop is flushed, the odor free dust is recycled outside. New to Feline Pine, my pound kitties had no problems adapting to the change (I think they were relieved).  My mother was so impressed that she started buying it and her Sammy loves it too.  I have tried "copy cat" brands, but Feline Pine is worth the extra cost.  To top it off, Amazon delivers the 20 lb bag right to my door.  How cool is that?

review/summary: Great litter!
review/text: I have 2 cats and we use this litter. This is a wallet friendly option to traditional litters and much better for them. Traditional litters, can cause health hazards to your feline friends so we chose this litter and have stuck with it ever since. It cuts out on odor and there is very little stray litter around the house (though, I admit, my kitties like to play with the pellets). Our pet resort even commented on what a great litter it was!

review/text: I don't quite know where I stand on Feline Pine. It's the litter my cat's breeder used, so as to not cause confusion I bought the same. It does keep the urine odor under control and there's no dust. But of course, it does nothing for fresh feces. It breaks down to sawdust fairly quickly; I scoop 2-3 times a day and change the litter every Monday and usually by Friday it is 80% sawdust. When it becomes more powdery, fresh feces is nearly undetectable, plus I use copious amounts of baking soda. I try to imagine whether clumping litter would be better to use, but I'm not sure yet. I don't believe there is any great litter out there.

I'm recovering from back surgery so thought this litter would solve the carrying problem. I changed out litter yesterday and my two cats used it last night with no problem. I came home from work today and more than half of the contents of the box was on the floor. What a mess! I know this litter is lightweight, but this is ridiculous. I'm going back to Arm & Hammer Essentials Natural Clumping Cat Litter (not found on Amazon). I wasn't crazy about the fragrance, but it too is lightweight and sure worked better than this Feline Pine.

review/summary: Worst Litter EVER.
review/text: I bought this for my 10 year old cat because it was listed on all of the consumer reports as the best and most natural litter you could buy.  Yeah.  Well apparently a great deal of cats are allergic to the oils in pine.  So what happens?  They stop eating, stop drinking water and stop pooping.  I am very worried my cat will now suffer lifelong kidney issues due to this.  It isn't just me either.  Since this happened I have talked to several other people, including my Vet who say this is a common occurrence and that Feline Pine is the worst thing you can do for your cat.  If you are anything like me you love your cat and you try to do right by her.  SO AVOID THIS PRODUCT.

review/summary: 4 stars for a single cat household. Not so much for multi-cat
review/text: I used this litter for almost two years for my 3 yr old male cat. It worked great. Never any smells and easy to clean. Plus the larger pellets don't track. However, one problem with this and other "set it and forget it" litters that absorb liquids as opposed to clumps that you remove, is that there is a large grey area in terms of figuring out when to change the litter. The bag mentions that all the pellets will completely break down once they have absorbed litter, but it's hard to determine when that point is. This leaves your cat pawing through a box full of damp(with urine) sawdust if you are not studious about checking the breaking point for the litter. Still, it worked great for one cat with consistent waste(read, nice and dry poop)<br /><br />This ALL changed once I got a new 3 month old kitten with stool issues(more liquid than solid, I'll just say). The problem is, any "moisture rich" cat turds don't really absorb quickly enough into the litter and the pine pellets are too large to effectively cover any waste like that.<br /><br />Sooo..you're left with these pine pellet covered turd mines that my cats would step on and then...well, cat poop is not fun to have spread around the house.<br /><br />On top of all that, the liquid absorbent qualities of the pellets meant having to change out the entire cat box pretty much on a weekly basis and since the litter isn't flushable, this became an issue.<br /><br />Being able to clean out all waste(solid AND liquid) on a day to day basis is the main reason I switched over to Swheat Scoop which I really like(and have reviewed as well). It keeps the cat box truly clean and it's flushable.<br /><br />I will say, that even with two cats, the feline pine kept odors down to a minimum(basically, you'd have to stick your head in the box to smell odors). So, I recommend it, keeping in mind the issues I had above. I think it's more of a one cat litter.

review/summary: A little known secret...
review/text: IF (and that's a big if) you can get your cat to like this kind of litter, it's great.  You have to mix clay and the pine pellets together for quite some time before they adjust.  2 of my 3 cats like it, and thankfully the third cat would prefer to go outside.  Well, Feline Pine is a great concept, but it is soooo much cheaper to go to a feed store and buy a 40 lb bag of HORSE BEDDING.  It is the same exact stuff, tightly compacted pine pellets.  I was using Feline Pine for a few months before my coworker suggested I go buy horse bedding instead.  Feline Pine:  20 lbs for $15 OR horse bedding:  40 lbs for $6.  It works exactly the same and lasts just as long.  The only difference is the Feline Pine has a stronger pine smell.  Save yourself some money and go to the feed store.

review/summary: This is the number one litter!
review/text: I have had cats for many years and have used several brands of litter.  When Feline Pine came out I tried it and instantly loved it.  I recently have mixed Tidy Cat Crystals in with it and have found a perfect combination.  Half of a small bag of Feline Pine with one third of the jug of Tidy Cat Crystals for one cat for two weeks.  It doesn't stick to the feet and track like the scoopables, it swells and turns to sawdust as it's used and the smell is very limited especially if you use a covered litter box with swinging door.  I don't scoop or do another thing to it until it's time to dump, rinse, and start all over.  You will find some saw dust outside of the litter box at the end of the two weeks but not tracked all through the house.  It is the best!

review/summary: price is highway robbery
review/text: These pellets are the EXACT same as "equine (horse) bedding", and similar to wood pellets for pellet stoves. You can buy a 40  (yes, forty!) pound bag of equine pellet bedding for only $6!!! (vs $10 for 20 pounds of Feline Pine!) I purchase at my local farm/tractor store. Wood stove pellets are even less - can get 40 pounds as cheap as $4.  I called the manufacture of one wood pellet stove product and they told me it is totally safe for pets...no chemicals used in production, and made from PINE, etc. However, some wood pellet stove are made from hardwoods (not pine) and this would not be as absorbent so you need to double check on the type of wood stove pellets. I'd stick with equine bedding...it is pine and made for animals.<br /><br />I do love this type of litter! No dust. Absorbs and masks odor better than any other litter. After using this type of litter for a couple years, I am pretty "skilled" at being able to scoop out mostly only the sawdust, and leave the intact pellets behind. My cats usually pee in the corners so that is where most of the sawdust is. Also, if you shake the box, sawdust drops to bottom and you can scrape intact pellets to the side and scoop the sawdust underneath out. If you don't pay attention when you scoop and are not tedious with a "method" like me, you will likely also scoop out a lot of the intact pellets too and thus waste a lot of it. We went out of town for 2 weeks, and our cat sitter used DOUBLE the amount of litter we use!<br /><br />For the star rating - I'd actually give 5 stars for this pine pellet type of litter. But I am giving one star because of the ridiculous price charged by Feline Pine!!

review/summary: Pro: No Tracking granules! Natural scent! Use the recommended sifting box!
review/text: EDITED TO ADD 3/18/2012: Still using this wonderful litter. My 7-month-old kitten uses it, my two-year-old Siamese and my 12-year-old Domestic Shorthair. We have two of the special sifting litter boxes made by the third-party company which makes them for Feline Pine. That is the only way to use Feline Pine, in my opinion, because it is so easy to use that way. Love this litter!<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD 2/10/2010: This is my new favorite cat litter. It does not track. It smells of fresh, natural, wood scent - no added scents, nothing artificial. It has a special litter box made by a third party for Feline Pine that you can buy to sift and separate the fresh granules from the used sawdust. Call the company, Feline Pine, and ask them for details on how to buy their litter box and they will tell you how to order one. I was concerned because my vet said cats have trouble digging in it. In reality, they don't dig at all to urinate, or they dig very little and they defecate on top of it, which is easily removed.<br /><br />Get the sifting litter box, made by a company specifically for this litter, and tilt the box back and forth, sifting the litter once or twice a day to remove any "sawdust" from the top level--this will shift the sawdust to the bottom level of the two-level box. Use the box as directed for best results.<br /><br />I have never been so happy with a litter system in my life. It has made life very easy. No more dusty litter everywhere. No more small clay granules tracking all over the house. (Note: the litterbox is denoted as "self cleaning" but it really is not; however, it is so easy! All you do is tilt it side to side and sift.)<br /><br />I have found my litter. I am 100% happy with this litter, COMBINED with their litter box.<br /><br />How to switch your cats to this litter: Put one inch of this litter on top of your current litter. Let your cats dig into it and mix it up as they use both litters in the same box. Gradually increase the quantity of this litter used and lessen the quantity of your old brand. I switched an 18-year-old cat to this litter!<br /><br />A NOTE ABOUT PINE OIL:  There is no toxic pine oil in Feline Pine cat litter. Many people think of pine oil in products like Pine Sol, which contains phenol, which *is* highly toxic to cats. I contacted the company prior to using this product. I received this assurance:<br /><br />"The production of our Feline Pine products incorporates both kiln-drying at 380 degrees (bakes out oils, phenols, and hydrocarbons) and pressurization (10,000 foot-pounds squeezes out further compounds) before the product reaches its packaging."<br /><br />"Our litters are completely natural and contain zero chemicals or artificial fragrances."<br /><br />My vet, who has a cats-only vet clinic, and who has treated my 18-year-old cat since he was a kitten, highly recommends this litter.<br /><br />~~~~~<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:<br /><br />I initially tried this out with a litter of four rescued three-week-old kittens and their mother. It doesn't track and is big enough that the kittens don't try to eat it.  If the kittens sample it, it won't hurt their digestive tracts like clay clumping litter could. Downside: It is hard for kittens to dig in as the granules are so big.<br /><br />After the granules are broken down, they are easier for your cat to dig, as they turn into sawdust.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Low to zero tracking<br />* Produces zero dust<br />* No odor - excellent odor control<br />* Safe for kittens and cats of all ages<br />* Flushable<br />* Turns into sawdust after it is urinated on; and then it is easy for cats to dig in<br />* NOTE: Feline Pine now makes a clumping form of this litter; it is a separate product<br />* Lasts a really long time before you need to change it<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Large granules make digging harder for cats (the vet said this but I didn't find it to be a problem)<br />* Doesn't cover poop well when it is in granule form. (However, I scoop poop up quickly)<br />(However, if you leave your Feline Pine in the box to turn to sawdust, it *will* cover poop.)<br />* Is not a clumping litter (but Feline Pine now makes a clumping version of this litter!) This is the granules version; see the clumping version if you prefer that kind.<br /><br />NOTE: This Feline Pine "granules" is not a clumping litter.  (But they now make a clumping litter version of this product if you want to try it.)  For the granules version, once those large granules of wood are urinated on, it turns into dry sawdust.  It doesn't clump and is hard to scoop because the dry sawdust mixes with the granules.  It will stay dry for quite awhile -- a few days or a week or two -- depending on how many cats you have.  The best way to clean this litter is to remove all of it and put in new litter.<br /><br />The great thing about the granules is, zero tracking. And it really covers the urine smell.  If you want to scoop, try Feline Pine's clumping litter. I prefer this to Feline Pine's clumping litter, as the clumping litter doesn't clump very well and it still tracks.<br /><br />To get your cats accustomed to this litter, read and follow the instructions on the bag.  It is very important to put a layer of at least one inch of your old litter on top of this new litter, or your cat will probably not accept this litter. Please be patient with your cat during the transition.<br /><br />The litter granules are made of Southern Pine. Tree farmers periodically have to thin some of the smaller trees to let in sunlight, which makes the forest healthier.  Those smaller pine trees are used in these types of renewable products. This is an eco-friendly choice in cat litter.<br /><br />My vet said cats find it hard to dig in.  I agree, but once the granules are broken down by urination, cats find it easier to dig.  Swheat Scoop ... I plan to give that one a try next time. UPDATE: Actually, I did, but I think I prefer Feline Pine, plus now Feline Pine has come out with a scoopable version. I plan on mixing the two: the Feline Pine granules with the Feline Pine scoopable, as I'd like to scoop but also like the no-tracking granules.

review/summary: The best option I've found so far
review/text: I've tried World's Best Cat Litter (corn), Feline Pine Clumping, and Feline Pine Original.  So far, I prefer the Feline Pine Original the best.  World's Best clumps wonderfully, and overall, I was very satisfied with it - other than the "feed store" smell I got when cleaning out the box, and the large amount of dust it left on my cats.  But I wanted to get my cats off of it because corn is a known allergen in cats, and I'm sure they were consuming corn whenever they licked themselves after using the box (mine are covered boxes, and it makes a LOT of dust on long-haired cats).<br /><br />Feline Pine Clumping is better because it's not corn.  However, it makes just as much dust in a covered box, and I don't want my cats inhaling a lot of sawdust.  Also, it doesn't clump as solidly as the corn - the clumps can come apart when you're scooping.<br /><br />So, I tried Feline Pine Original (the pellets).  I also ordered from their website one special Feline Pine sifting litter box and scooper, which they recommend to use with it (kept one of my own original boxes to compare it to).  The pellets turn to sawdust when saturated with liquid, so in the special Feline Pine sifting litter box, the sawdust sinks to the bottom box and the fresh pellets stay in the top box.<br /><br />Overall, I like the design of the Feline Pine special box, but I wish it were bigger and deeper, since my cats tend to knock a few of the pellets out while digging (but not excessively so).  Also you definitely need to put some litter in the bottom box, under the sifting box, because some of the pee does trickle down between the pellets and into the bottom box.  The directions say to just add a handful of pellets, but I ended up putting some of their old litter (mix of corn and F.P. Clumping) down there and it absorbed it nicely.  (My cats are well hydrated so more than just a little bit ends up down there.)  I don't think having pellets alone would absorb it enough.  So when I scoop each day, I lift the top box, scoop out any pee clumps from the bottom box, and add a little more of the old litter to the bottom box if needed.<br /><br />I've also been using the pellets in their old box (Clever Cat Litter Box) and it seems to do fine.  You just stir the litter around so that the sawdust ends up on the bottom.  Eventually, when enough of it turns to sawdust, I'll sift it using the new F.P. sifting box, and throw away (or compost) the sawdust.<br /><br />I've noticed NO pee smell whatsoever (but all the other litters I used were good for that too).  And because I mixed it in gradually with their old litter, they got used to the different texture over time, and now they're fine with it.<br /><br />Overall, I like that it makes my bathroom smell slightly (but not too much) like a lumber yard (I love the smell of wood), and there's WAY less tracking - if pellets fall out of the box, I just pick them up and throw them back in.  And, most of all, I like that there's almost no dust for them to inhale in the covered box, and they're not licking corn off of themselves (they don't come in contact with the corn litter that's in the bottom of the F.P sifting box).  I also like that it's compostable!<br /><br />Try it, but remember to mix it in slooooowly over time, cuz it's definitely a different feel under their paws.

review/summary: This is all I ever use anymore
review/text: I love this litter because...<br />1. It completely eliminates urine odor. It doesn't smell like a litter box typically does (like clay, urine and feces). Feces do smell right after your cat uses the box, but this goes away. The idea that a cat litter is going to eliminate feces odor right when the cat goes doesn't make sense to me...it would have to be loaded with chemicals and perfumes, which I don't want. The odor goes away within a few minutes, and I just scoop out feces at the end of the day.<br />2. It is very inexpensive. You only fill the box a small amount, unlike clay litters. I use it along with the Feline Pine Self cleaning litter box, and this is the best value. I only have to buy a new bag of litter once or twice a YEAR.<br />3. It does not track nearly as bad as clay or other fine grained litters<br />4. Biodegradable materials<br /><br />What would you rather have, a litter box with 3 or 4 inches of clay litter that starts smelling after only a couple of days and is disgusting and must be trashed by the end of the week, or an inch of Feline Pine, that does not smell and lasts for 2 weeks before needing to be changed? I almost want to laugh when I go to people's houses and I see their disgusting clay litter boxes, or see people buying clay litter at the store. Don't they know there's a way that is not only better for the environment, but doesn't smell and is a better value?<br /><br />I would also like to note that my cat is one of those picky sensitive cats that will not use litters with a lot of perfume or with a texture she doesn't like. I purchased the generic pine pellets at the pet store once and she flat out refused to use them, but she ok with the Feline Pine pellets.<br /><br />To those who are saying FP is a "poor value" because you can buy horse pellets at the store and they are the same, first of all I have my doubts that they are exactly the same and break down the same. I also don't understand why it is even an issue, considering that FP is cheaper than clay cat litters and works better. Personally I like shopping for cat litter and knowing that I am supporting a good environmentally friendly company, rather than a company that makes clay litter loaded with perfumes and chemicals.<br /><br />Note about the price: I don't recommend buying it here on Amazon. At most stores you can get a 20 lb bag for only $10, I have even seen them on sale for $8. I would never pay what Amazon is asking here.

review/text: I tried this litter for the health factors, but didn't feel like waiting for the Feline Pine Litter Box to ship (not available on Amazon, only from company website), so I got the Lift 'n Sift variety thinking I could use it the same way since they are similarly constructed. This was not the case. The holes in the LNSift version are too big, and the pellets fall through. The Feline Pine Litter Box (FPLB) has square holes that are 3/16", which is big enough for the sawdust to go through but not the majority of pellets. You would think that the wet pellets/sawdust would get clogged in the holes, but I don't have this problem as long as I don't overfill the box.<br /><br />Using LnSift box: Big waste of litter and more of a mess to clean up than I was expecting. I almost gave up on the litter and then saw other reviews that said the FPLB is a must for you to truly get the full benefit of this litter. With the old box, weekly cleaning was around an hour, with the appropriate box, clean is a few minutes per week.<br /><br />Using FPLB: The key to using this box with minimum work on your end is to FILL IT NO HIGHER THAN 1-2" with litter. Every time I've accidentally overfilled it, there's been a big mess for me to clean up in the end. When the box is filled too high, the sawdust can't get through the pellets and out the holes to the bottom box, which creates tracking and messy litter. And, the bottom box fills up too quickly and you have to try to empty it while keeping the top part from spilling all over. Not fun, and I end up wasting litter doing this. My advice: Take a permanent marker and put a line or mark at the 1" and 2" spots on all sides (inside) of the upper box (measuring up from the bottom of the box with the holes in it). This way you know when to stop pouring.<br /><br />Pros: Healthier litter, no tracking (we find maybe a handful of pellets, no sawdust, outside the box), odors are greatly reduced, easy to clean on a daily basis (we flush the solids and just use the scope to shuffle any leftover sawdust around to get it to sift through the holes), easy to clean on a weekly/biweekly basis (just tip the sawdust filled box into a garbage bag and top off the pellets), one bag of litter lasts us about 3 months if we fill the litter box as noted above (1 cat), fairly simple to transition our cat using the instructions on the Feline Pine website (took about 2 weeks total).<br /><br />Cons: No real cons about the litter now that I'm using it properly and with the right tools, but I wish the FPLB came with a hood (kitty doesn't have the best aim at times...).<br /><br />Additional advice: I didn't like the clumping version of Feline Pine (bought that first before the pellets), but instead of getting rid of it I used the clumping version to lightly line the bottom pan of the FPLB. It's recommended that the bottom box be lined with some pellets to catch any liquids that get through in the first couple of uses to reduce odor, but I just used the clumping version to do the same. Worked great and I didn't have to waste the clumping litter.<br /><br />Also, feeding your cat a species appropriate diet (no grain, raw meat preferrably) has a significant effect on both the amount of waste produced and the odor. We're extremely pleased with the results that a grain-free diet has had for our kitty!

review/summary: I'm converted
review/text: I have been using clay litter for 20+ years. I just adopted a new cat and her two kittens after my final 15-year-old clay-using cat passed away. Grudgingly I bought a bag of pine litter on the adoption center's recommendation with the logic that it was what they were used to, and the kittens would not ingest clay scoopable this way. Sold, ok, I can transition them to clay, right?<br /><br />No thanks! I love these pellets. My cats don't track them out like some people's, though, and that helps. I feel like clay is MUCH messier. Here is the technique I've developed. One inch in the bottom of the pan (which scared me when the adoption lady told me that, it seemed like way too little!) and I scoop daily. First, scoop the poop out. Then I use a dust pan, like for sweeping the floor to move half the litter aside and sift the litter using a "traditional" clay litter scooper. The sawdust sifts into a pile, and I put the pellets in another pile. It doesn't take that long because there is only an inch of litter in. Then I scoop out the sawdust using the dust pan, which I only use for the litter box, and it goes into the compost. Sprinkle on fresh pellets and I am done.<br /><br />I should note that I use a very wide shallow pan (it was meant for an underbed storage drawer) since my previous elderly cat got so creaky she had trouble making it into a normal litter box. Works great for kittens/multicat for me.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />Pros:<br />* Good smell, even after multiple cats pee on it<br />* Seems to handle even diarrhea ok (my cats are freshly vaccinated/wormed)<br />* COMPOSTABLE!!! I hated throwing out clay, now it goes in my city compost bin.<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Probably needs to be "managed" daily with multi-cats<br />* Pricier, though I seem to use less?

review/summary: Miracle Product
review/text: This stuff is absolutely incredible.  I'm allergic to just about everything, including the dust that rises off of traditional clay and silica litter.  If you have a special room for your litter, you'll notice that regular dust gets on every surface.  It's disturbing, really.  That stuff is going into your lungs you know.  Feline Pine has NO DUST.  Pour it out, and your litter area smells pleasantly of a lumber yard (well, I find that pleasant).  When cats use the box, urine breaks down the pellets and is absorbed.  Solid waste sits on top.  You only run into trouble if your cat has gastrointestinal track problems - loose bowel movements are more difficult to scoop.  The pellets track a bit, but they're large and a litter mat will slow their progress across a room.<br /><br />Now, I will offer one caveat: this litter is terrific, but only if you use the right box.  If you use a regular, non-sifting box, the pellets will break down into sawdust, and the sawdust will then just sit there.  This sawdust can track further than the pellets, because it can stick to kitty feet.  The solution?  A sifting litter box.  Either the Tidy Cat Breeze box or the Feline Pine litter box works, the latter better than the former.  I have both.  The Tidy Cat Breeze litter pads also work nicely with this product in the holding reservoir of a sifting-type box.  Put the Feline Pine on top, shake the box or move the sawdust around with a scoop, and sawdust will fall into the reservoir under the top tray.  Et voila!  No sawdust on top, fresh pellets are not wasted with constant litter changes.  Just make sure to shake the broken pellets into the bottom and there's no tracking.  Scoop feces and flush down the toilet (yes, this litter is flushable too!).  If you use the Tidy Cat Breeze pads, they will help soak up any moisture in the sawdust that falls into the reservoir, eliminating any odors.<br /><br />Also a bonus: you only need about an inch of litter in the box.  A bag will stretch for quite awhile.  As pellets turn to sawdust and fall into the reservoir, just add more pellets.  No litter changes necessary.  Just remember to empty out the litter box reservoir as it fills up.<br /><br />In terms of getting cats to use it, just mix the Feline Pine with your regular stuff for about a week, gradually increasing the Feline Pine and decreasing the regular stuff.  I trained a 9-year-old cat to use the litter in a week.<br /><br />In short, this is a miracle product, especially in a multi-cat household.

review/summary: Best with Feline Pine litter box
review/text: I have had a cat and a kitten for about 6 months now.  I had tried a myriad of kitty litters prior to settling on Feline Pine.  Since one was a kitten and both came from a shelter, I don't think the cats were particularly picky about their litter.  I switched them from clay to pine pellets without using any transition and they were unphased.<br /><br />After using Feline Pine for a few weeks, I decided to go ahead and buy two of the litter boxes made for the litter.  Having the ability to sift out the sawdust (which is created when cat urine breaks down the pine pellets) into the bottom pan has made litter box cleanup SUPER easy!<br /><br />This is what I do:  1.  Scoop solids once per day and shake the box side to side in the evening to move any sawdust that the cats didn't scratch down into the bottom pan.  2.  Empty the bottom pan about one time per week by dumping into a 5-gallon bucket with lid.  3.  Place a few of the slightly broken down pellets (those that have been in the litter box for a week) into the bottom pan.  This keeps the sawdust from sticking to the bottom pan and makes dumping easier.  4.  Add some fresh pellets to top tray if it looks too shallow.  I do this when dumping bottom tray. 5.  Completely empty the top tray about one time per month.  Place some old pellets in bottom tray as stated above.<br /><br />You can apparently use the sawdust as compost.  I prefer to get rid of it by dumping the 5-gallon bucket into a trashbag when full.  Then again, I also have dogs and I worry they would get into the compost.  Another note - a 20-25lb. bag lasted me about a month (with a little left over) and that took care of two litter boxes.<br /><br />My final suggestion ... and this has been mentioned before ...  if you have a local farm store such as a Tractor Supply Company, look for Equine Pine which is horse bedding.  It is the same thing, but costs FAR less.  Up until recently, I was buying Feline Pine at $9-11 for a 20-25lb. bag.  I found Equine Pine for about $6.50 for a 40lb. bag.  MUCH CHEAPER!

review/summary: My Cat Hates It.
review/text: I was shopping at my local Kroger and saw this on clearance for 2 dollars, I always wanted to try feline pine so I figured I'd give it a go. I poured the litter and was very pleased with the smell, my apartment smelled like the mountains :D. My cat is 14 weeks old and completely litter trained and has never had an accident... until we tried this stuff. She wouldn't even go in the litter box and stood on top of her litter box staring at me like I was crazy. I woke up this morning, walked to the bathroom to find to my surprise a huge turd on top of the toilet seat... Needless to say we won't be using this stuff anymore.

review/summary: One of the worst cat litter I have ever used
review/text: I decided to try Feline Pine because I was sick of the clay cat litter getting everywhere. But after the first day of using it my whole house smelled like cat poop, even when I scooped it out every time my cats went in it. It was disgusting, I can't even believe that I ever tried it. I figured it was to good to be true.

review/summary: The best of the best.
review/text: I was extremely skeptical at first.  How could pellets do anything for cat litter?  I had come across this stuff at my local pet shop since they had a bag on sale, got out the iPhone and went straight for the Amazon app to check reviews.  I was utterly amazed at the positive reviews.  Almost to the point of not believing them there were so many.  We were clay clumping it for so long, I had no idea there were other options.  I was surprised by the reviews and went for it.  I will never.  I mean NEVER go back to clumping litter EVER.  That stuff is utterly disgusting once you've used this litter.<br /><br />There is zero and I mean zero urine smell.  Yes, their crap stinks, but the clumping litter didn't do wonders on that either.<br /><br />The only mistake I made with this litter was I thought I could make it work using my existing litter box.  You absolutely need a sifting one and after looking all over the net, it sounds like the best one is of course the one Feline Pine makes.  But after shipping, it was over $30.<br /><br />I thought I'd go it on my own and created one using an 11/64 drill bit (that is the perfect size that doesn't allow pellets to fall out).  Yes it took about 2 hours to drill and 2 battery charges and lord knows how many holes later, but in the end, it works and it works well.<br /><br />You can not go wrong with this purchase.  It is as simple as that.

review/summary: Good, but........
review/text: In the search for a more natural and less waste-producing cat litter, I stumbled upon Feline Pine.  Since I could not find an official Feline Pine cat box to use with it, I decided to try the Tidy Cats Breeze litter box.  My cat seemed to like Feline Pine just fine, and the Breeze box seemed fine, too.  At first.<br /><br />As for the litter itself, the true subject of this review, I really like it.  I especially like that you can actually flush the cat poop down your toilet, since the pellets dissolve into sawdust when they are wet.  Although the pellets did seem to stick to the poop, it was still really easy to scoop out of the box and dispose of.  I didn't notice much tracking beyond a very close perimeter of the box, probably due more to her attempting to bury her waste than to the pellets sticking to her paws.  No tracking upstairs as with the old clumping clay litter, no "litter box feet" smell on the actual cat, and no more licking clay litter dust when she is grooming.  The odor of the box is not horrible, but it certainly doesn't mask the poop odor like clumping litter.  I didn't buy it for that purpose, and my box is in the basement, so no big deal.  The smell wasn't intolerable, just kind of funky.  Wet sawdust meets cat urine meets poop.  And, this litter is pretty reasonable and lasts quite a long time, in my opinion longer than a tub of clumping litter because you don't use as much in the box.  Ultimately, the litter is a great product if you have a proper box to use it with.<br /><br />Now, for the box.  I read many reviews where people mentioned using the Breeze box with Feline Pine.  And it does work.  Kind of.  The wet sawdust falls into the tray below and the tray can be emptied into the trash.  The solid waste stays on top.  Every time I scooped the poop I'd sift the box, bringing the dust down to the tray.  Then I would dump the tray and I was done.  Very simple.  The problem is that every once in awhile you really do need to clean the box.  I don't mean scoop, I mean clean, with actual soap and water.  The tray gets rather nasty with all that urine-soaked sawdust falling down there (sometimes I'd even have standing puddles of urine waiting when I pulled out the tray) and would benefit from a soap and water cleansing about once a month.  So begins the nightmare.  The box is hard to clean with this litter in it!  The pellets get stuck in the sifting grid, and I don't have a utility sink in my laundry room, so I hauled the box upstairs to the tub to try to "rinse" them out.  The pellets dissolve in water, right?  No, they don't dissolve!  They turn into sawdust!  Big mistake.  Don't be foolish like I was and try to put Feline Pine sawdust down your tub drain.  Duh!  It clogs the drain!  I ended up with a bunch of sawdust in my tub, which I then had to plunge out of the drain and scoop out with my hands.  Disgusting.  I should really have tried picking them out first and then washing the box.  Live and learn.  Either way, it is a huge pain to soap-and-water cleanse the box.<br /><br />I am deducting a star because Feline Pine makes a box specifically for this litter, but it's not available!  I guess you could use a regular box, but that seems an even worse option.  You'd have a ton of soggy sawdust sitting on the bottom, and the cat would end up digging in that.  Gross.<br /><br />Feline Pine, I need a decent box for this litter!

review/summary: Depends on the cat
review/text: I love this litter, in theory-- it is dust free, keeps the smell to a minimum, and is natural.  And, this litter was EXCELLENT for my old girl who urinated a lot.  The litter is fantastic at trapping the ammonia smell that I hate so much, and it slowly broke down as she continued to use it..  But, my younger kitty wanted NOTHING to do with this litter, no matter how slowly I tried to transition her over.  I'm not sure if she doesn't like the texture on her feet (I probably wouldn't either) or the fact that it's harder to dig in because the pellets are a different shape/heavier, or what.  But, I'd recommend giving it a try to see if you have any luck with your cats.  The health benefits, and how cost effective it is, are worth giving it a shot.  (As an aside, I would not consider this in any way a "clumping" litter like the product description says...)

review/summary: two types of Feline Pine
review/text: Feline Pine WAS making two types of cat litter, but the BETTER of the two is becoming hard to find.  One con given for what I shall call the 'rabbit food pellet' variety was that is doesn't clump.  I HATE the pellet type of litter, and my cats don't care for it either.  HOWEVER,  Feline Pine DOES (or at least, DID) make a CLUMPING variety of pine litter that works WONDERFULLY.  It's small grain pine granules of sawdust are light, smell great (and continues to smell better even after use - more than ANY other type of litter I've come across) and clumps reasonably well with the addition of guar gum - a food type of thickening agent.  It doesn't clump quite as well as clay litter, but doesn't have any of clay's disadvantages, either.  A good trade off, in my book.  It was first recommended to me by a friend of my daughter's who pet sits for us on occasion, because her allergies made clay litter problematic.  I took some to my mom because the weight of clay litter was a problem for her 84 year old arthritic hands and bad shoulder.  What I don't understand is why anyone would use the pellet kind when the MUCH better clumping Feline Pine is available.  Now it's getting hard to find the clumping kind in local stores, but the pellet fad seems to be taking over.  I don't get it.  The five stars I gave are for the clumping variety - I wouldn't give the pellet kind more than two - it does still smell better than clay litter, but that's pretty much the only thing to recommend it in my book.  I need to find the Feline Pine website and tell this to them too.

review/summary: Incredible odor absorber- NOT a standalone litter
review/text: Reading all the negative reviews I completely understand the issues they'd be talking about.  Then again it should be common sense looking at these that obviously it wouldn't clump.  These pellets are huge.  They're probably 3/4 an inch long and 1/4 in diameter.  Clay litter obviously is maybe 1/8 inch round, so it sticks to poop.  These are kind of glossy.<br /><br />So bottom line is if you use this as a litter by itself, you're kind of dumb for even trying to do that with pellets like that.<br /><br />However, if you mix it in with clay litter and baking soda, it absorbs odor like you wouldn't believe.  You can literally eat dinner right outside the litter box and won't smell a thing.<br /><br />Get the CLUMPING feline pine.  That clumps and absorbs moisture perfectly.  Also no odor.  That's five stars, this is three just because it eliminates odors.

review/summary: love my cats, HATE their litter box, but Feline Pine has made it easier
review/text: When I moved to NYC my outdoor kitty became and indoor kitty and we adopted a second cat to keep him company.  Our Manhattan apartment is SMALL so their litter box is never far away and I am highly sensitive to smell and to litter tracking everywhere.  I spent years trying many brands of litter in my pursuit of avoiding synthetic fragrances, dusty litter, minimizing tracking and ease of maintenance... Initially I was sold on the green tea brand, but cleaning was a bear because massive cat pee clumps form everyday from the two cat traffic and the pellets don't fall through my scoop.  Although the smell was improved, I could still detect cat pee (even though we were removing all the pee clumps??) starting at about 7 days out.  And I am cheap, so I would try to squeeze up to two or three weeks out of a bag before I gave up and dumped the whole thing out, cleaned the box and started again.<br /><br />But now, I found the perfect solution, started using Feline Pine pellets cat litter 5 days ago. 1/3 of the 20lb bag in a large litter box for my two cats.  I/ve been removing any solids from the box frequently (we share a bathroom, as soon as I see it, I scoop it) and stir up the box once a day to balance out the moisture laden parts (the pellets become powder once wet). It seems like 80% of the pellets have converted to powder.  After cleaning and stirring, I shake up the box and a layer of fresh pellets rise up to the top which prevents the pine powder from tracking out.  So far, after 5 days of 2 cat traffic, bathroom smells fresh, there is no tracking and it is so easy to maintain.  As I mentioned, I am cheap so I will see how long this 1/3 of the bag can be used before it begins to smell a bit funky...  But, even if I have to dump it out every week, $10 for 3 weeks of fresh smelling non-tracking, kitty litter is a no brainer.  I am so thrilled.

review/summary: The best so far
review/text: Nothing's perfect, especially kitty litter.  We've tried many different kinds including World's Best (which smelled really horrible), Sweatscoop, and pea pod varieties.  Thankfully, our two cats are rather flexible and adapted very quickly to the Feline Pine pellets after we tried the scoopable version first and decided it tracked just as bad as the others (one of our main contentions with litter, the other being smell upon urination).  These pellets really absorbs urine oder, but you do need to scoop out the solid waste a little more frequently since they have difficulty burying it.  Tracking is very minimal.  The fact that no strip mining (like for clay litter) and no offensive perfumes means that it's a little more environmentally friendly than many commercial litters.  Biodegradability is also a bonus, though I can't speak for flushability since my apartment managers strictly forbid flushing litter of any kind.

review/text: While I love the idea of using a renewable and natural product, particularly one that gets tossed every few days, the odor with this product is almost as bad as the odor it's supposed to suppress. My three cats wouldn't go near it. Perhaps the aroma wears off soon enough, just not soon enough for me. In addition, the pellets are quite large, not the fine, sand-like quality my cats are used to. I'm sure it works well for some felines, just not mine.

review/summary: Perfect for our cat
review/text: We are very happy with Feline Pine. I don't know what kind of litter the Humane Society  uses, but our adopted kitten (aprox 6 mos old) used it from the first day we brought her home. I have a strong aversion to cat box smell in any house and don't like keeping a litter box, but with a new kitten who's not allowed outside, it is necessary. This litter is not only non-toxic for cats and humans, it neutralizes odor and can be composted under trees and shrubs when it is used up. We use the litter according to directions - covering the bottom of the box with one inch of litter, scoop poop as soon as we discover it (usually 2x/day), and only need to change the box once every 7-10 days when all of the pine pellets have turned to pee-soaked sawdust. With the Amazon subscription to have a 20lb bag delivered every 2 months, it is perfect litter solution for our home. I have already recommended it to every friend with felines.

review/summary: I've tried them all!
review/text: I've been a cat mom for 15 years and have tried every cat litter under the sun.  I was looking for a litter that both my cat and I would like.  I tried using thick puppy pads once and thought I found the golden egg until I realized that his paws were very damp when exiting his litter box and that he was doing a paw stamp project all over my floors and furniture.  This was NOT a good thing...  So much for being creative and resourceful...<br /><br />I finally bit my humble bullet and returned to my good and faithful Feline Pine Litter.  Yes, there is a little tracking (very little) and it's no fun when you unexpectedly step on a piece of pine.  Ouch!  On the other hand, Feline Pine does absorb the urine and hide the odor quite well. I also like the idea that it's a natural product and that it's not full of chemicals or skin irritants that can harm my cat.<br /><br />Here's some frugal advice...  If your kitty pees in the same spot in the litter box like mine does, just scoop out the wet litter from that spot and add new litter to fill the now vacant space in your box.  Voila!  Your kitty box will be smelling fresh and piney once again.  You will also use less litter and have more money to spend on cat treats and toys (the fun stuff,) instead!

review/text: I loved the way it absorbed & soaked up the cat urine, leaving a piney scent. but the cats loathed both the smell of pine & the hard goatfood-pellate shape on their dainty feet. Perhaps if they would grind it into something finer. Some of the pieces even get lodged between their little toes.<br /><br />The other problem is the tiny amount you get & how much it costs. I have a lot of kittens & a lot of litter boxes to clean several times a day.

review/summary: Great stuff, no "cat smell"!
review/text: I have one indoor cat and have been using this product for at least 4 years now.<br /><br />At one point, I found myself living in a small dorm-style room (7'x 15'?) with my trooper of a kitty. Needless to say, things were cramped, and my cat was sadly confined to just this small room. Having a litter box 3' from your bed requires the absolute BEST in odor control.<br /><br />I tried EVERYTHING. Clay, crystals, clay WITH crystals, etc.. And came upon Feline Pine. I was very eager to try it since it's natural. Well, I've never gone back to any other brand! (And we aren't even living in that tiny room anymore..)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Poop smell. This is NOT neutralized very effectively by the pine pellets. If your cat buries his/her business, you are in slightly better luck. My cat often doesn't, which I've found generally happens when I've just put fresh pellets in. However, for myself the poop smell is a blessing in disguise. It keeps me up on the chore of the litter box, which was easily forgotten the time I tried out one of those "private room" litter boxes (out of sight, out of mind - I promptly forgot all about taking care of things until my lovely kitty decided to remind me by moving her "operations" to the living room floor.. My fault).<br /><br />2) Pellets are too easy to scoop up when removing poop. Using a conventional scooper, I often lose a couple of pellets down the toilet when scooping. I believe Feline Pine sells a scoop made specially for their pellets though - something to try (I haven't).<br /><br />3) Pine dust tracking. Like any litter, the pine dust tracks out and my bathroom floor needs sweeping every other day or so. It doesn't seem to track much more than other litter types, however.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) NO cat urine smell. I couldn't believe it! So long as you replace the pine pellets once they are all saturated, there is NO smell. With one indoor cat, I find that I need to completely replace the 1-2" of litter once a week.<br /><br />2) No scooping out urine clumps. Damp sawdust needn't be removed - just stirred around so it can air dry (and no biggie, since it doesn't smell!)<br /><br />3) Natural. My cat used to sneeze and cough from clay litters, and the crystal litters reek of chemicals. Not to mention chemical fragrances. Cats lick themselves to bathe - would you rather your cat licks off chemicals, or pine dust?<br /><br />4) Poop smell. Yeah - for me, this is actually a pro. See above.<br /><br />Bottom line: Try it out. Like I said, I've never gone back. And once my friend gets through his drunken impulse-buy of 12 cases of crystal litter, I have a feeling he's going to be trying out Feline Pine too.

review/summary: No smell!
review/text: We recently added a cat to our family. We have never had a cat, so cat litter was a learning process. I tried many brands and have decided, hands down, that Feline Pine is the best. There is litterally no smell. I do like the pellets better, but scooping is a problem unless you have the right kind of scoop, which I do not yet. I am waiting for mine in the mail. You can't buy one, but FP suggests that you can just break out every other piece of plastic on your current scoop. I am just using the clumping until I get my scoop. It works just as well except there is a tracking problem with it.

review/summary: Completely better than clay!
review/text: Cleaner than clay, less odor, less mess. I adopted a shelter kitten two years ago, and did tons of research into the best litter and food. The vet experts shied away from Feline Pine because of the strong scent (said cats don't like it). So I went with clumping clay litter. Anyone who has used clay knows all about the dust and tracking issues, especially if you live in a small apartment, which I do. After getting tired of coats of litter dust everywhere (including on my cats - who not only inhale but ingest the dust when they groom themselves) plus the unending battle of tiny pieces strewn everywhere, I switched to Feline Pine. It has made all the difference in the world. I am completely happy with this product. True, they did not like it at first; it is a radical change. But after two months they have adjusted and are fine with it. No more dust, no more dust on the cats, no tiny pieces everywhere. Lasts a long time and practically no odor. (I clean the box twice a day.) Usage tips: Definitely buy the wide-slotted scoop, a minimal cost. Otherwise you'll throw out too many clean pellets. The pellets disintegrate when wet and I scoop that out too. It does require a different technique. The makers say to just shake the box so the wet stuff falls to the bottom. I say yuck, why leave used, wet litter in the box. So I take the wet stuff in the new scoop and filter it through the old scoop, which leaves the dry pellets behind. Takes longer but totally worth it. Keeps it cleaner. Highly, highly recommended, especially if space is an issue.

review/text: I am continually amazed at how much pet stores and retailers selling pet supplies charge for basic stuff.  Feline Pine is no exception.  I switched my multiple cat household to pine pellets, and for the first time EVER, I don't smell cat urine.  However, I don't buy Feline Pine.  Go to your local feed store and buy the 44 pound equine bedding pellets for about $6-7 per bag.  HUGE savings and the same stuff!

review/summary: Useless
review/text: Picked up a bag of this on recommendation from the lady at our neighborhood pet store.<br /><br />This litter consists of large sawdust pellets that are too big to fall through the scooper, and as soon as they get wet, they disintegrate into damp sawdust that smells rather piny and neutral, but is impossible to scoop because it doesn't clump whatsoever. This is the opposite of how I want my litter to act. The dirty stuff falls through the scoop, while the clean stuff gets stuck in it?<br /><br />I don't think my cats like the damp sawdust either. They ended up peeing on their bed even though this litter was "clean".

review/text: This is a cruel joke for cats owners. 1. the pellets are too big for poop scoops, so you can't get the poop out without "playing" in the crap!  2. pellets are too big to smother the stink from poop, when your cat goes #2, YOU'LL KNOW! 3. older cat wouldn't use it. I bought this stuff at walmart last night, I come home to a house that smells like it's been painted with manure!

review/summary: MUCH BETTER THAN CLAY CLUMPING LITTER BY FAR!
review/text: Used to use clumping cheap litter for our 4 month old kitty- was super super smelly and just plan gross and tracked EVERYWHERE!  yuk.  saw feline pine at target and decided to try it out- SOO Much better!  Despite reviews i do NOT have a special litter box, just the $20 lid one sold at petco and it works out fine with this litter.  the #2 does not clump like clay so sort of unsightly, but there is NO odor!! shocking!  the pee just turns into powder dust like others have mentioned, very cool.  I just clean once daily with my scooper and there is no smell whatsoever and we have a tiny tiny house.  get this, you'll be SHOCKED if you're switching from clay yucky litter :)  By the way, i did NO transitioning phase, just threw out old litter and replaced with feline pine and my cat starting using it the same day, no issues :)

review/summary: Our kitten eats the pellets...
review/text: We have a 9 week old kitten that we recently adopted from the local pound and she's been eating the pellets, which we think is causing her to have diarrhea.  We just discovered that she's been pooing under the coach as well.  Maybe Feline Pine is good for certain cats, but not this one.  Also doesn't seem to absorb the smell very well.<br /><br />.....<br /><br />UPDATE:  It turns out our kitten had coccidia, which was causing her diarrhea.  Perhaps she was eating the pellets because of condition - I'm not sure.  We stopped using the product in any case.

review/summary: Love everything about it but the pine dust
review/text: Have been using feline pine with our three cats for nearly five years. The only thing I don't like about it is the pine dust that your left with once the pellets get wet and break down. We have found that every other day we--meaning me--have to clean the litter box to remove the poo as well as the dissolved pine. A small colander works great to separate the still usable pine from the dust. I would give my first born to the person who designs a self cleaning litter box for this litter :)

After calling about the rest of the litter she came from and finding out none of her siblings had eye problems, I realized the one thing different was the new pine litter.  After going back to regular litter her eyes cleared up.<br /><br />Too bad, it really cuts the odor down a lot, plus the litter has a nice pine smell.  Apparently it is too strong for my kitten.

review/summary: 5 cats 0 odor
review/text: Considering what cat litter products are available to me, this is the best choice. I only have one requirement for cat litter. No odor. Feline Pine delivers. As far as I'm concerned, if you can walk into my New York City sized studio and not smell a single one of my five cats, then this product is doing it's job and doing it 100%.<br /><br />Unlike clay litters this does not leave annoying clay rocks all over my apartment. It leaves absolutely no trace of urine odor. And that disgusting wet urine saturated clay litter smell? Gone forever. When I come home from work, I smell nothing.<br /><br />I don't know if my town even has a feed store to get the cheaper version of Feline Pine. I don't care. I'll gladly pay the extra money. In fact, I purchased two 20 pound bags today and it costs me about $20.00. It's worth it.<br /><br />A word to the unsatisfied. Try using a sifting litter box for Feline Pine or rubber gloves to clean the poop out by hand. Then you won't waste so much unused litter when emptying the feces and urine daily.

review/summary: TOILET TRAINING
review/text: We are in the process of toilet training our cat using Litter Kwitter.  This requires us using a biodegradeable litter (flushable).  The product is great!  Urine is odorless.  When wet, this product simply disintegrates into particles that behave as tiny individual sponges.  They flush beautifully.  We do not flush a tremendously large amount.  Just the portion that may spill into the toilet while the cat is using the Litter Kwitter insert.  Not more than a cup of litter is flushed.

review/summary: This used to be much better
review/text: Feline Pine recently changed the formula to make it "2x absorbent." That also means it disintegrates twice as fast and now I have litter dust everywhere in my house.  If you don't mind it in your bed, in the kitchen, on the furniture, and on your clothes, this litter is for you.  It hides the odor better than any other litter - period.<br /><br />FYI, this is the second set of cats I'ved used Feline Pine with so I've been a customer for over 15 years.  I just vacuumed yesterday and there's litter dust on my dresser, on the sofa and on the floor.  I've bought my last bag of Feline Pine.  What a shame.

review/summary: Feline Pine - works well!
review/text: Used all sorts of litter - clump, clay, beads, cornmeal - and found this one to be the best of the bunch. The smells are quite mitigated and you don't get new bugs as you could with the cornmeal-based ones. Clumping can lodge itself to the litter box and scrapping that can be a pain. This ships on a schedule for our two cats and with their old point system, got a free scoop. The cats come out with clean paws, unlike the clay-based litters - we'd find litter, literally, all over the house, on sofas and chairs, on the bed, wherever they roamed.<br /><br />One draw back though is how you want to deal with the broken down litter, since it becomes soft and builds up in the box. You can throw it all out but there's still a good mix of "unused" litter pellets. So with more effort, the larger scoop can haul out the solid waste and we use the usual litter scoop (smaller holes) and sift through, keeping the pellets. More work but makes it last longer, that's the only drawback but otherwise it works well keeping the odors out and not tracking it around the house.<br /><br />Used it for about 6 months now and happy with it and prefer not to change it.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009YUEG2">Feline Pine  Original Cat Litter, 20-Pound Bag</a>

Now there is more sawdust tracking outside of the cat box, and you have to change the litter box more often. This is still a good product, but the larger pellets were excellent. "New and Improved" is really, new and you're screwed. It is a shame a company can take an excellent product and make it mediocre. I would have paid a higher price for the original.

review/text: This litter does work pretty well.  It doesn't track, controls odor well, and my cats liked it.  However, when cleaning you will have to scoop a ton of the litter out to get the cats pooh and the remnants of pellets when they break down to saw dust after being peed on.  This makes you go through a ton of this stuff and you have to make sure you clean it every day if not twice.  This, plus the fact it is expensive to begin with, makes it extremely expensive.

review/text: This litter smells worse than the most hideous smelling poop my kitten, Willow, has ever produced. Also, the saw dust is used is so light that, while it doesn't create the same dust as many clay litters do, it is easily kicked out of the litter pan when Willow is covering her waste.  In fact, the first night, she kicked literally half of the pan contents onto the floor.  I decided to get a covered litter pan-- that helped, but did not stop the problem.  Also, this litter tracks all over the apartment-- it appears in every room, on every surface that Willow has visited.  Not long after vacuuming the floors and furniture, we still need to brush off saw dust that has transferred to our clothes from the couch.  I'm so disappointed in this product!<br />(I bought Feline Pine at a store, not through Amazon.)

review/text: This product is amazing!  I had been using clay litter forever, and I finally got fed up with the dust and the tracked litter in my bathroom, so I started looking into other options.  I picked up a bag of Feline Pine (which costs much less at Target than the current price on Amazon, hence only 4 stars)and I have been nothing but impressed.  There is a nice pine smell in my bathroom, and my house doesn't reek of cat urine.  No dust irritating me when I clean the litter box, a huge plus.  And there isn't clay on the bathroom floor! (Who enjoys stepping out of the shower into nasty cat litter tracked onto the floor?!)  And my cat took to it right away, no problems.  Hopefully that will be the case for your cat.  I understand picky cats; mine will only eat one brand of cat food.  So if you are sick of clay litter, definitely give this a try.

review/summary: Not a hit in our house...so far.
review/text: I don't like this stuff at all, and most importantly, neither do my cats.  I wanted them to get use to a better kind of litter and first tried the Yesterday's News only to have them avoid it like the plague.  Then I thought maybe they would like this if it had a natural fresh scent.  Hard to say because even when I put a little in one box with their regular litter, which is clay, only one of my 3 will even venture in only to hop right back out. I have 3 cats and have 4 boxes set up for them which are cleaned at least twice daily...I know I know, I'm a clean fanatic with that which they are happy about to be honest.  Anyway, this stuff is bright yellow and has an awful smell to it AND it is dusty!  The pieces are so big and I'm guessing it would be uncomfortable to walk on.  Anyway, I can't picture this one being a winner and will probably try the cedar chips as one last try.  After that, I think I'm done trying to fix something that isn't broken.  I mean after all, they all use the boxes exclusively so I may just leave well enough alone.  If they don't want to be eco friendly, heaven only knows I can't make them.<br /><br />UPDATE 12-31-2011:  After several weeks of trying to entice them to using this, I gave up.  I put just a little in one box, out of 4...I have 3 cats, and they all avoided that one.  Even the one who was most curious about it and had investigated it in the beginning wanted nothing to do with that box.

review/summary: Not for multi-cat households
review/text: My husband and I have been using this cat litter since we adopted our female cat 2.5 years ago. We love the litter for her. It's eco-friendly, safe for all of us, and she is fine with it. It's also flushable, but since we are on the coast, we do not flush (toxoplasmosis, which is harmful to the human fetus, is also harmful to sea life). We have the 2-layer litter boxes specifically for Feline Pine Original, so cleaning up was easy.<br /><br />Over time, we adopted two boy cats. When we had only our girl and one boy, the litter was fine, but now that we have adopted a third cat, the litter is no longer acceptable, despite cleaning twice per day. It does well with the urine smell - until you clean the box - but doesn't cover up the fecal smell even if it's been buried all day. Coming home to a poop-smelling house is not pleasant and is totally embarrassing if we're with guests. Additionally, when cleaning out the urine-soaked sawdust, I feel like I'm going to pass out from the strong ammonia smell. This smell can be noxious for the cats if you have an enclosed litter box where the fumes get trapped. We also have serious fly issues from the litter garbage (we know it's because of this litter since we tried a different litter and didn't have flies).<br /><br />I would definitely continue using this litter if it still worked for us, but it sadly doesn't.

review/summary: Not for my cats
review/text: I want to like this product. I really, really do. It's definitely better for cats (one of mine has asthma, and clay litters bother him a lot), and the fresh pine smell is so much better than perfumed litters or kitty waste. However, this stuff tracks everywhere! I stopped using it three weeks ago, and I'm still finding little bits of pine all over the house and in my laundry. One cat is a chronic litter digger, and the other is a Maine coon with furry toes that catch everything, so even with a covered litter box and a bath mat in front, little tiny bits of the broken pellets get everywhere. Maybe if your cats are neater than mine, this is a good choice.

review/summary: not the best brand I've tried
review/text: The first brand of cedar litter I tried was Pet Smart's Exquisicat cedar litter and like it. Then tried Feline Pine because I found it at Walmart for a bit less. But it is much more dusty and scooping it out meant clouds of dust, so I thought that can't be too good for the cats to dig in. Switching back to the Pet Smart brand. I see on the box that it contains some clay, but you'd never know it as the product is light and fragrant.

review/summary: Not for every cat
review/text: Pros: Does not smell like cat litter when you pour it<br />Flushable<br /><br />Cons: Makes the room with your litter box smell like cat poop<br />Texture may not be accepted by your cat<br /><br />I was toilet training my cat and needed to switch to a flushable litter. I gradually mixed this into my cat's standard litter box for a week. He did not like it. At first he held it for about 36 hours before finally, grudgingly using it making sad meows the whole time. The texture is radically different than any sort of litter and is made in very large pellets. As I transitioned to the citikitty, he again would only use it grudingly and twice decided that other locations were more preferable! I switched to "World's Best" litter and he likes it much better and doesn't go to inappropriate locations anymore. It is very flushable, and even flushed after my cat scraped his entire pan into the toilet, causing the liter to absorb all of the standing water in the toilet basin. It may not smell like litter when you pour it, but it doesn't clump and absorb odors so your room smells like cat poop. If you do decide to use this with the Citikitty, you'll need a lot more than the label suggests for standard boxes- every time your cat uses it, he'll scrape about 1/3rd of the litter in the pan into the toilet.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: I have used this product for many years. I have always preferred the natural cat litters and find the Feline Pine to work well. It keeps down the smell and can be recycled, minus the poop, into my  garden beds and seems to keep the rodents away.<br />I was especially happy to find it at Amazon in 20 pound bags making it cheaper per pound than the  7 pound bags found in the supermarket, plus delivered to my front door. What could be better.<br />A little goes a long way if you don't fill the litter box too full, just about an inch or so on the bottom and scooped every day and I replace about once a week with fresh litter for a multi-cat household and only replace about once a month for one cat. It does track pine dust once the pellets break down, but what litter doesn't. If you like clumping litters this isn't the litter for you, but I'd give it a try if you want to go natural.

review/summary: love it!....maybe????
review/text: We have tried World's Best in order to avoid toxic chemicals of most cat litter and to find an eco friendly slution for our two cats.... but World's Best only sent us running back for Fresh Step.<br />Feline Pine however, is wonderful. There is no smell, and though there is a bit of tracking... there is nothing to complain about as now I know the tracking is not toxic to all of us (humans and feline alike)!<br /><br />The only negative thing about this litter is that we found it after I had purchased a great litter box that can not be utilized with this litter :(<br /><br />I hope that soon, we can find a litter box that will work with Feline Pine, but for now, we like it enough to deal with the scooping problem.<br /><br />Update:  It is now May, thus about 5 months since we switched to feline pine.  I still love it..... but one of our two cats, does not.<br />*ugh*<br />Dh gets very upset and wants to go back to *that chem filled 'other litter' that our cats do well with.  I still am pleading for more time..... but it does get pretty tiring to find turds on our fine Persian rug! >:/<br />Luckily, they still pee in the box...otherwise I would have to give up and go back to the 'toxic litter'.... *praying that silly cat gets used to feline pine!!!*

review/summary: Feline Pine Original Cat Litter, 20-Pound Bag
review/text: Great product! Easy to clean and cover some bad oder of the cat urine. The best part is that I saved a lot money by using this kind of cat litter. The traditional one is not eco-friendly. This one is! Moreover, you add little more when the cat litter runs out. You don't have to throw away the whole cat litter and change for the new one. The other best part is that this one is flushable! PS. You have to use two layer litter box in order to make this function well.

review/text: What I love about this litter:  (Actually, I have never "loved" a litter before.)  Easy to use.  No odor if cleaned regularly (daily, of course)  Very economical!  Easy to use and discard.  Very little "tracking".  Compostable.  We have a special compost pile for kitty litter...is used only on decorative plants.  Has a great pine scent.  The cats took to it easily. (Initially, I added small amounts to the top of the clay litter to let them get used to it.)  And now I can buy it here and have it delivered to my door.  How great is that??

review/text: I have tried all litters and I love this one, I have two cats.  I was concerned when we had a crawling baby that the chemicals would be tracked through the house (wood floors) and I do not like the thought of my kitties licking their paws after having them in clay or clumping litters.  I like that I do not have to worry if a pellet gets put in the toliet either!<br /><br />The odor control is amazing.  Some dust does track, but just shake teh pan side to side to get teh sawdust to go to teh bottom.  I also use to line my bird cage.<br /><br />The points on the packets is great too, after 4 large bags, you get $5 back by check!<br /><br />Def recommend it

review/summary: No smell!!
review/text: I switched to this cat litter on the recommendation of a friend when I complained about the smell of the cat box in my bathroom (downside of living in a small city apartment). This stuff is amazing- natural (perhaps somewhat environmentally friendly?) AND takes care of smell WAY better than anything else I've tried. Now, it doesn't hide poop smells, but it's really the cat pee that's the killer. My cats had no trouble adapting to the new litter, but they're not all that picky anyhow. It is a bit hard to scoop (the large kernels get caught up), so we've gotten lazy and just scoop once a week and then replace every two weeks.<br /><br />The other major benefit (unexpected) was the lack of tracking. With other cat litters you invariably find "dust" all around the box, footprints on your bed, etc. Some does get kicked out of the box, but it doesn't go anywhere. It's probably better for the cats too, since they're not cleaning it off their paws all the time!<br /><br />Amazing stuff!

review/summary: Natural Cat litter---I feel green
review/text: One of the reasons I love pine litter is because it is just a natural product.  You can flush, put in yard or throw away and not feel guilty.  I hate all the fake scented cat litter.  Feline Pine just smells like pine.  After you scoop, you can mix up the litter in the box and it will dry.  You just add a little more into the box and it's good to go.  Very rare that the cats drag the pine pellets out of the box.  If some get out, you can just pick them up off the floor and put right back into the box. The pellets are large enough to handle.  I have three cats using one large box and it works out fine. I think it's a great product and the only litter I will use for my cats. In the summer months I scoop out the box and dump the litter in the yard near the pine trees. That's a great feeling!  You can't do that with normal cat litter.

review/text: I really like this product as a day to day litter. When it needs to be changed it comes out easily and is light weight to throw away. When I show my cats though I take a gel crystal litter as the Feline Pine does get dusty and can stain the feet. Household cats don't have to worry about it.

review/summary: Works for dogs too
review/text: I actually bought this for my dog to use.  I have a mini dachshund and he uses a dog potty called Ugodog.  I tried the dog pottys with the artificial grass on top and they just smelled awful because the urine clings to the grass and my dog didn't want to use it (I don't blame him).  I put the Ugodog out on the patio and he uses a sliding glass doggie door to go out.  I put about 1 1/2 cups of pine pellets in the Ugodog tray which is lined with plastic--I buy the Glad OdorShield Tall 13 gal. trash bags and cut them in half because cat box liners didn't fit.  Then the grate goes on top. I change the pellets about once a week or every 5 days and the pine completely covers the urine odor.  It's easy to lift out the liner and fold up and dispose of the used pellets and solids are flushed.  I tried using paper instead of the pine pellets, but they smelled and were not as absorbent.  Highly recommend the pellets.

review/text: I don't believe people should know I have a pet by the smell of my house. Therefore, I like products that keep the smell to a minimum. I also believe in protecting my animals, the Earth AND myself by using organic and chemical-free stuff when I can. I have three cats, and Feline Pine is the BEST I've tried (and I've tried a few). It really absorbs and changes the smell of urine so that the ammoniated smell is eliminated, and it just smells like cedar, and it breaks down to dust, which flushes cleanly and healthily. I've used the expensive stuff, and it comes nowhere close to this.

review/summary: not scoopable!
review/text: our cat adjusted quickly to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003DI09YS">Feline Pine Scoop Cat Litter, 10.1-Pound Box</a>, and it worked better than all the clay stuff- so we assumed this was the same product.  NOT SO! As other reviewers say, this is basically the same stuff as the fuel for pellet stoves and equine bedding-  big fat large pellets that do not clump, scoop, or break down quickly.  I can't recommend this one at all, especially as others have said- you can get it for 4 or 5$ at the feed store as equine bedding.<br /><br />I really wish that other product (Feline Pine Scoop) was offered in a much larger size and/or as a subscription item, as it's (almost) perfect for our older cat:  it covers the smell, is easily scoopable, and is a small sand-like texture.  Yeah, it tracks easily, but in comparison to clay and these pellets, it's great.

review/summary: Best Kitty Litter For Small Spaces
review/text: Well, it's kitty litter, so it's not my favorite household item, but this brand is by far the best I've tried. I live in a small apartment in New York, and my main problem with other types of litter was the dust. There would be dust everywhere it seemed - not just around the litter box, but somehow all around the apartment, which made things musty and meant that I had to dust multiple times per week. What I love most about this litter is that it is 100% dust-free. I have also noticed that this is the most odor-free litter I have ever had. As other reviewers have mentioned, there is no odor at all with urine until you get a couple weeks in and need to change the litter box, whereas with other litters there was always a lingering pee smell throughout my apartment, which was just gross. Poop obviously smells, but no more so than with other litters. Finally, this litter is very environmentally friendly. Instead of using plastic bags every day, I just flush it down the toilet. I've been using this brand for over a year and never plan on switching!

review/summary: Best Litter I have used
review/text: I have 4 kitties, and this is by far the best product I have used.  I have tried them all.  I've tried the pearls, the corn litter, the paper litter, and of course the traditional clay litter.  The thing I love the most about this litter is how little it can be tracked.  The pearls can be tracked, and it hurts like a @#$%#$ when you accidently step on it.  The corn litter and the paper litter doesn't mask the smell of urine.  And the clay litter leaves dusty floors no matter how many times you clean.  The pine litter is by far the least tracked litter.  Another thing I like about this litter is the way it can cover up urine smell.  It smells like wood, or the "new furniture smell", even after the cats do their thing.  The litter turns to powder after it comes in contact with urine.  But since it absorbs it so well, you just see saw-dust.  All you have to do is scoop up the solid waste, and when the puebbles turn mostly to powder, you just change out the litter.  The powder can be tracked a little bit, but again, must less than any other litter.<br />Something I recently learned is that if you collect the pine points at the back of the package, you can redeem it for scoopers and litter boxes and other kitty stuff.  And you don't need to buy 100 bags to get something.  I can redeem points from 2 bags for a scooper already.
