review/summary: Pretty Good Decaf
review/text: I switched to Decaf and was looking for a decent cup on the Keurig machine.  I was only interested in Subscribe and Save options.<br /><br />This is a fairly light roast, which I like.  I brew on the middle setting and I think if it was brewed any larger I would think it was too light.

review/summary: Not my favorite
review/text: Of all the K-Cup flavors that are out there, and there are many very good ones, this is one of my least favorites, and I have tried almost all of them.  Not much flavor to this one, even if you add various types of creamers.  Of course, it is all a matter of taste, but this one doesn't taste all that good.  It is not bad - it is just kind of there - like a generic coffee.  Try something else instead.

review/summary: Jamaica Me Happy!
review/text: I am a huge fan of Jamaica Me Crazy coffee.  There was a time in my life when I was totally caffeine free and off the dark stuff, but a customer in the bank I worked at brought in a pound of this coffee as a gift to the tellers.  Every time someone walked by my desk with a cup of this freshly made joe, the smell would really tempt me to go back to consuming coffee again.  Eventually it broke me down, and I am back to being a full time coffee drinker, and proud of it! Imagine how happy I was to find my favorite brew in a K-cup!  The only thing better than a cup of Jamica Me Crazy is a cup sweetened with the new Almond Joy flavor International Creamer in it to highlight the sweet coconut.  Unfortunately, we only have a Keurig at our office (I'm in Real Estate now), so I have to go to work to enjoy a cup.  I'm thinking I have a brilliant boss who knows how to get people to willingly show up to work! Now if I can just figure a way to use it to temp more buyers into our office - I'd have it made ;0)

review/text: I bought this grudgingly because my favorite Timothy's Italian Blend was out of stock...... and I was very happily surprised! It's not as "big"  and winey a brew as my favorite, but was flavorful, had a delicious aroma and was smooth. I tend to like rather potent coffee but I have clients who prefer a little lighter cup..... this will be perfect! I will happily keep buying this coffee. Thanks Wolfgang!

review/text: This one will not disappoint!  I got this yesterday and my husband and I tried it this morning with breakfast and we both loved it.  I have gotten many different kinds of the k-cups to try but after trying this one, I think I could be happy with just this one and black tiger for those mornings when I want a really strong cup of coffee.  The rodeo drive blend is delicious with a nice round feel on the palate and an interesting flavor on the finish with just a hint of smokiness.  Perfectly balanced and absolutely wonderful!  Plus, I have to admit...I love the label. The different color looks very appealing on my carousel with the other k-cups.

review/text: For years, I've been completely devoted to Dunkin Donuts brewed at the store and at home.  I tried brewing DD in my K cup and I also bought the Eco Brew and the actual DD k cups.  Awful!  So I was searching high and low for a new coffee.  After trying all the decaf k cups on the market, I finally found and loved Wolfgang Puck decaf coffee k cups.  This is the only place I can find them so I hope Amazon never stops selling them here.  They are mellow, medium roast and I enjoy them every day.  Any other brand is just a back up.  Try them.  I have never had any trouble with any of the cups and I'm on my third order now of 48 cups.  If they had a problem, they've fixed it.<br /><br />This is an update being done on July 7, 2012.  I continue to drink at least two cups of this coffee EVERY day.  It has ruined me for other coffees as I measure every other cup against this incredible Wolfgang Puck Decaf k cup.  Please, please, PLEASE Amazon, make this part of your subscription service.  My head hurts trying to make sure that I always remember to order so as not to ever be out of this wonderful coffee.

Some have worked well; others have not. Some are too mild; some are a bit "off" on taste.<br /><br />This Wolfgang Puck product is one of the more successful experiments with the Keurig machine. It has a rich taste and still remains smooth. Not too strong a flavor, but it does have flavor.<br /><br />So, the two coffee drinkers in my household are quite pleased to drink this brew.

review/summary: Great, but not perfect
review/text: I roast my own Colombian beans at home so I have a perfect "10" for reference. Right off the bat let me say that just like their Sumatran reserve, this k-cup is not bitter, but smooth. The aftertaste is also smooth. My chief complaint is it does not taste like a Colombian bean. It really is missing the deep flavor of a columbian coffee, while the Sumatran Puck K-cup definitely has a Sumatran taste. The "8 oclock" brand you see in many grocery stores has a more distinct flavor than this k-cup. That being said, my final recommendation is that I would recoommend the Puck Sumatran over this if you like a distinct coffee flavor. However, if you are looking for a not-too-stong-but-not-bitter coffee, this Colombian is a great choice. I would buy this again just because of the smooth taste.

review/text: I've always been drawn to K-Cup varieties with out there names (Jet Fuel, Black Tiger) and distinctive flavors (Golden French Toast, Spicy Mayan Chocolate). This offering melds those two features into something I'm happy to wake up to!<br /><br />To me, Jamaica Me Crazy's definitely got a pervasive coconut taste fairly similar to Dunkin' Donuts coconut flavored coffee, but it's also got a lot of the flavor characteristics I've come to expect from K-Cup chocolate brews. Barely any of that acidic aftertaste that's almost inevitable with artificial flavors, and definitely not as watery as many other K-cup varieties. Sure, the name's pretty corny and the taste is hardly subtle or sophisticated, but that's what makes this cup of joe so fun!

This stuff is more of a medium and burns the tip of your tongue for a while. I probably won't put it on my popcorn but I won't throw it out either. It's a very good flavor and I will try it on some other stuff like chicken breast or maybe sprinkled in a ranch dip.

review/summary: Less tasty than the regular version
review/text: My wife and I love the Cheez-It White Cheddar crackers and go through a box or two each week. We have tried both the reduced fat and regular versions, and now eat only the regular version even though it has more fat for two reasons:<br /><br />  1. The regular version tastes noticeably better. There is a much more robust cheddar taste. While the reduced fat version is still tasty, it is a little bland compared to the regular version. We can easily taste the difference.<br /><br />  2. The fat content of the regular version is still relatively low compared to other snack foods such as potato chips or cheese puffs. Therefore getting a much better taste is worth  the extra fat for us.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you need to really watch your fat intake in everything you eat, then this is one of the tastiest reduced fat snacks you can buy. However, the regular version does taste better.

review/text: My Lab loved these and got them every night for a bed time treat.  He just died from stomach cancer at age 9. I started researching what is in the dogfood and treats we give our pets and you do NOT want to give these to your dog. Look at the ingredients.  PROPYLENE GLYCOL is the same chemical as car anti-freeze which is lethal to animals. Why is it in there? You also do not want to see BHA in your pet treats, this is a known cancer causing preservative.  It is listed twice. Look up on the internet to find out what "animal digest" is before you feed it to your dog.<br /><br />I thought I was giving my dog healthy stuff made especially for him by a company that loves animals, not so! Give your pets natural foods and treats for their well being. It will only cost you a few dollars more. Don't make the mistake I made by giving my pet so many chemicals.

review/summary: Best Dog food on the market!!
review/text: I recently switched my GSD/Greyhound mix to this food as he was experiencing food sensitivities and bacterial overgrowth in his small intestines. The vet at his renowned NYC area clinic recomended probiotics as well as a food change to a single protein food along with one that has no wheat, corn etc as these are top foods causing this. Also eagle has probiotics within the formula. The difference in his 6 year old demeaner is amazing..more energy, stools are consistent and also turns out it has glucosamine in it which also helps his hips as he inherited the bad hips from his GSD blood lines.  Also, it turns out my brothers purebred champion hunting and show dog pedigree lined golden retriever also is on this line of food as recomended by the breeder. He uses the high protein formula when she is in hunting competition, and in the thick of bird season.  Works wonders and man is she a strong muscled bitch!! Can't say enough about this food...just try it if you really love your canine!!

The tagliatelle is excellent and cooks in under 2 minutes, like fresh pasta. I have no interest in this or any other pasta company - I just hope that this brand becomes popular enough to be an easy to find product!

review/summary: Great coffee for the price..
review/text: During a long night of searching the Amazon web site I came across this coffee deal for a price of $14.00 with Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Since it was about $10.00 less for the same amount of coffee beans that I had purchased from Amazon in the last few months, I thought I'd give it a try.<br /><br />I have bought Hawaiian Kona whole bean coffee, Lavazza Super Crema Espresso whole bean coffee, and Starbucks Colombian whole bean coffee in my quest to find a good, reasonable priced coffee bean. But, even at the lower price that I paid, this ranks right up with the best of the more expensive coffees.<br /><br />It is smooth, full bodied, with no "after bite" in the back of the throat. It is not a dark Italian coffee, as some might use for espresso, but is what I would call a full flavored, and rich, breakfast blend, I prefer it to two other brands that I over paid twice to three times as much for.<br /><br />I did sign up for the Subscribe & Save simply because of the lower price, but now I'll use that account to continually receive this coffee once a month.

review/summary: Good, but not great
review/text: Eight O'Clock Dark Italian Roast is better than the French Roast. The beans are a bit darker, a bit more oily, with the coffee having a bit more flavor. Perhaps that's because the four bags I received were perfectly vacuum sealed. The French Roast bags were not.<br /><br />This coffee is a big step above Folgers and other supermarket coffee. But if you like Starbucks or Peets you'll be disappointed. It's nowhere close to the full rich bold flavor and smell of these two (and some other local coffeehouses where they roast their own beans).

review/summary: Not espresso, but a good, dark cup of coffee
review/text: I love dark, rich coffee. When I was in Italy, I brought back as much as customs would allow. I've always wished someone in America would make a good coffee like that, but most seem to either leave it too light, too weak, or burnt. This isn't going to make an Italian espresso, but the coffee is dark and robust. I don't know if it's the roasting process or the packaging, but there isn't a lot of oil left in these beans, and that would go a long way toward making this a better coffee.

review/text: While this isn't quite as good as one of the bolder varieties of Peet's or Starbucks, it's reasonably close, and can be had for about half the price if you catch it on sale. I have tried most of Eight O'Clocks, and for me this is easily the best, much better than the French Roast. It also seems to deliver a bit more caffeine kick- which for me is a plus. If you're tired of paying for Starbucks, give this a try and see if it doesn't satisfy your fixation while thickening your wallet!

review/summary: Not great but very good.
review/text: Okay, so I'm a bit picky about my coffee beans. If you are reading reviews about whole bean coffee you probably are too. We don't just buy what's on sale at the grocery store. We put true consideration into a coffee purchase in that endless quest for the perfect cup of coffee. Well, your quest won't stop here with this Dark Italian Eight O'Clock. The beans themselves weren't all that impressive, not dry but not nearly oily enough. The color was too varied, some light colored beans, some dark. The texture was not firm, very hollow and too brittle. The aroma was nice but a bit weak. I ground it extra fine and still used more than usual to get enough flavor. Overall the flavor is good. Bold, and rich and dark but just not quite bold and rich and dark enough. Usually Italian blends include some robusta beans, this one does not. Which is nice. It is good coffee, just not great coffee.

I'd also love to be able to change the type of coffee I receive each month if possible... but I'm not sure if I can do that without canceling and resubscribing.<br /><br />Overall, this coffee is delicious. I enjoy all types of Eight O'Clock coffee though, so I may be biased.

review/text: I could pretty much write the same about all of the Eight O'clock coffees I've tried.  They taste good and are reasonably priced.  This doesn't taste as darkly roasted as their French Roast, but it's so close it's hard to say.  One thing to look at, the bags are 11.5 ounce, not 12.  (And 12oz is not a pound) so the per ounce price creeps up.

review/text: I'm a big fan of dark roasted coffees, but have been having a difficult time finding any here in southeast PA.  Trader Joe's is nowhere to be found (not enough ageing hippies and young hipsters, I guess...).  I stumbled on to this coffee at the local market last year.  As I recall, it was about $8.00 for a bag smaller that the one Amazon sells!  I checked here for "Subscribe & Save", and lo and behold (!) - four 11.5 ounce bags for under $20.00!!<br /><br />Their other roasts are good, too.  I've had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00362FJD2">Eight O'Clock Coffee, French Roast Whole Bean, 36-Ounce Bag</a>, but I find I prefer the Italian - darker, bolder, better.  Smooth, deep flavor, no bitterness.

Is it because of cost saving, or vacuum leakage? It would be perfect if they could blend in a more aromatic coffee, such as Kenya coffee.  Although it is labelled as Dark Italian Roast, it tastes more like a medium roast, which suites me just fine.

review/summary: Superb coffee
review/text: Everyone's taste buds are a little different.  I find that the fast-and-dark roast like the French roast (and all Starbucks Coffees) taste like a cat peed into them.  The overheated oils and scorched beans taste like overheated oils and scorched beans.  Italian roast beans are loaded into a cool roaster and brought up to the required temperature for a full rich dark roast.  I use a french press, add a little half-n-half to the cup and top with freshly whisked (to soft peak) unsweetened heavy cream.<br /><br />It is certainly easier than roasting a blend of cracked raw beans in a cast iron frying pan; which is what I used to do to get a similar flavor profile.<br /><br />Also, it is to be made quite strong, like the coffees you would get in Germany--so it is not "cheap" coffee to make.<br /><br />When you make espresso with a machine, the water is actually under pressure and above the boiling temperature of 212 degrees (Fahrenheit)and using three tablespoons of ground coffee to make 4ozs of espresso.  Good Espresso tastes exactly as it smells because of the temperature and pressure of the extraction process.  (I have had a lot of bad espresso.)

review/text: I like rich, dark, bold coffee.  After giving up my K-cup machine to go back to a traditional brewer, I was looking for a dark roast that could match my bold k-cups. I drink a lot of coffee, so I wanted to find something more reasonably priced than the "name" brands.  I saw a posting on another site for a deal on this coffee and figured I'd check out the reviews. Most were good, and the price was pretty fantastic so I decided to give it a try. Wow! I am so impressed.  Smooth, delicious, bold flavor.  I've been drinking coffee forever, and managed an upscale coffee shop for 2 years, and I truly love this roast. I think it's comparable to the pricey brands for sure.  Seriously, can't recommend it enough.

review/text: This coffee smells wonderful when it's brewing- Excellent to wake up to.<br />While Eight O'Clock Bokar is my preferred morning brew, the Italian Roast is a nice change of pace.<br />Italian Roast is also very nice after dinner with desert.<br /><br />It's best made in small batches as it does not hold well so just brew as much as you will use in 20 minutes or so after brewing.<br /><br />Eight O'Clock Italian Roast is not the finest coffee you'll ever have but it's very, very good for the price.

review/summary: Not good enough
review/text: After reading a number of good reviews, I ordered this coffee.  Was I disappointed!!! It was indeed a dark roast but to the point that it had a burnt taste.  This was the worst Italian roast coffee I have ever had. Did I get a bad batch? I am now wondering what I will do with four bags of burnt coffee beans.

review/summary: Good Coffee but not the best
review/text: It is a good coffee with a good aroma. Good for espresso. It came in 4 separate bags that are easier to store. We usually like to change beans and this, so far, is one of our favorite.<br /><br />After trying coffee beans from Urban City Urban Espresso Coffee Roasters I have to lower the stars from 5 to 3. It is still a good coffee but the foam is not as thick and doesn't stay as long. Also, I prefer the aroma from the Urban City Urban Espresso Coffee Roasters' coffee.

review/summary: Not great; seems to have a (very) short shelf life once opened...
review/text: Good coffee if made soon after the bag is first opened, beans just ground, and coffee freshly brewed; however, the shelf life compared to comparable products seems to be quite short.  And the coffee seems to get 'bitter' rather quickly after brewing.  Since we like to refrigerate coffee to make iced coffee beverages, this obviously isn't a good thing.  I would possibly buy this brand again, but not this type.

review/text: I bought these chocolates as an early surprise Christmas present for my significant other to hold her over until she is able safely enjoy sugar again, but her reaction surpassed my expectations. I must admit that, initially, they seemed a tad overpriced, but they are certainly high quality and indistinguishable from a similar product that did use sugar. So my review of these gourmet chocolates is best summed up with the phrase, "worth every penny."

I do not have complaints about the dark chocolate, that is exactly what I expect from Ghiradelli. However, most salted caramel has a notably tangy, salty flavor and this caramel does not have that at all. It tasted roughly the same as their regular caramel, with no salty flavor at all!

review/summary: If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It !
review/text: When I found the product on Amazon it was Origional Bottle and origional Label from many years ago, and across the page the new label "Perfect Pinch" as you show it. I clicked on the old origional and believed that, that was what I would receive. It was not what I received and I was very saddened to have been deceived.. I received the "Perfect Pinch" which I had seen in stores and tried. It is not even close to the same. The "McCormick Perfect Pinch Origional Chicken Seasoning" is not perfect...much more sage than the origional, totally different taste.<br />The origional was, "McCormicks Fried Chicken or Chicken Fried Seasoning". It was pulled off the market, but came back claiming to be the origional but the name had changed from "McCormicks Fried Chicken Seasoning", to just "McCormicks Chicken Seasoning", but it was okay. Now this "Perfect Pinch" is all wrong. The origional was a perfect seasoning<br />This is a perfect example of "If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It". I truly regret this has happened when for 15/ 20 yrs or for as long as the origional was out there, I would buy every bottle on the shelf. My entire family and numerous friends lived by it....If you get one thing perfect...you'd think you'd have the sense to leave that "One Thing Alone". Trust me , it was a top seller..I've searched every store front from The Mexican border to Canada, and East Coast to West Coast trying to find the origional.."BIG MISTAKE MCCORMICK"!<br />TLFLP

review/summary: Green Tea & Jasmine Flowers--That's All!
review/text: *****<br />Numi Tea's Monkey King Jasmine Green Tea is a premium Numi tea, both certified organic and kosher. The only ingredient is fair trade certified special grade green tea that is scented with real summer jasmine flowers from China. There is nothing artificial in this or in any Numi tea. Perfect!<br /><br />On the box, the manufacturer writes: "Jasmine tea is the oldest known scented tea, and ours begins its life in the gardens of Hunan Province. The rich soil and fluctuations in daily temperature yield a fragrant leaf which is further scented with delicate white Jasmine blossoms. During summer, these are gathered daily by the banks of the Min River and repeatedly mated each night with the prepared tea, naturally embracing all of the flowers' scent. When brewed, this smooth, organic green tea has layers of subtle fragrance and hints of moonlight. It is a most romantic tea, and, like a bowl of fresh picked flowers, will bring the joy of summer to your every sip."<br /><br />It sounds quite romantic, and it does certainly taste wonderful. It is a true jasmine tea, and the taste of jasmine predominates, in a both strong and lovely way.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love jasmine green tea, this will probably be the best you've ever had.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****

review/text: Numi's Jasmine Green Tea is my favorite green tea. It's pleasant flavored and very nice smelling. What I like best is that if I over steep, it doesn't turn bitter like other green teas. I like a little sweetness so add a spoon of turbinado sugar. This tea can be a little pricey and the grocery store, so I like the 3-pack, which helps lower the price. Amazon used to offer a 6-pack, which was nice because I drink this every day and would not have to order it as frequently. Now I just order 2 of the 3-packs. Other details that make this a standout company in tea bags is that it's organic and free trade.

review/text: Actual jasmine blossoms are laid on the green tea...simple, effective.<br />Numi makes great teas, highest quality. I can actually steep this for quite a while without getting a bitter cup. Cheap green tea tastes puckery after steeping too long. Not so with Numi. Tastes great with a very light clover honey, but go real easy on any sugar so you can taste the jasmine! Make sure to inhale deeply as you sip...be in a quiet place too.

review/summary: I don't always drink bagged tea, but when I do... I prefer Numi Jasmine Green
review/text: I don't always drink bagged tea, but when I do... I prefer Numi Jasmine Green<br /><br />Before I switched to full leaf teas a few years ago, I settled on Numi Jasmine Green and found it to be the best tea I could get my hands on in the grocery store. I recently decided to bring some of my old bagged teas to work where I don't have as much time to make full leaf tea all day, and among some others which have been in my cupboard for years the Numi Jasmine Green came along. Guess what? In spite of my tea snobbery, in spite of it sitting on the shelf for several years, this tea is fantastic. I can't recommend it enough. Strong, a little sweet, fairly forgiving with steep time, plus it's USDA organic and fair-trade certified. Currently enjoying a cup with a spoonful of honey!<br /><br />I also recall enjoying Numi's Rooibos being fantastic.<br /><br />Stay thirsty, my friends.

review/text: I'm pretty budget minded so I thought I would try to find a substitute for the jasmine tea I've enjoyed for many years. It's almost twice as expensive and now I know why. At first, I thought it was because I had a cold; now I see it's just a different tea, much weaker in flavor. For me, this is a case of "you get what you pay for" and I'm a little surprised at the rave reviews here. I'll be going back to Mighty Leaf's jasmine green, which is really excellent and just accept the price tag.<br /><br />Also, a friend taught me to drink that tea with a little milk or cream (and I add a few drops of stevia). I don't know much about tea but I really enjoy that particular blend of ingredients.

review/summary: I am impressed.
review/text: Let me start by proclaiming two things; First, I am by no means a tea connoisseur like some of the other reviewers here, and therefore in no capacity to speak to the artistry of making tea. Which, brings me to my second point, I will not be able to be as eloquent in my speech regarding a comparison of this particular tea to any other.<br /><br />Now that I have provided my disclaimer...this crap is pretty good! My primary reason for drinking green tea was for metabolic reasons, so I rarely ever gave much thought to its flavor...it was more so for medicinal purposes, not enjoyment. Now, I believe I can have the best of both worlds.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here I realized I was brewing my green tea improperly which caused a bitter taste (this was using the Stash brand). Once I got the hang of the correct water temp and steeping time I realized green tea had a much more delicate and sweet flavor than I had been experiencing.<br /><br />I decided to try this brand as an alternative to Stash and Traditional Medicinal's brands just for kicks. I was a little uncertain of how the Jasmine flavor would effect the delicate taste I had recently become accustomed to in green tea but I have to confess I believe it enhances the flavor immensely. Some of the reviewers noted that after steeping the tea, they could no longer smell the Jasmine and I have to agree with that. But, what they do not say is you can still taste it. It is a very light floral flavor and I love it.<br /><br />It's almost like the honeysuckle nectar that you used to get from the wild honeysuckle flowers in the summer when you were a kid. Its wonderful! I normally sweeten mine with organic light agave so it doesn't overpower the tea. Simply put, in my opinion it is a must try.<br /><br />By the way, the price here on Amazon kicks butt over the price at my local organic market, especially if you sign up for the automatic shipping.

review/summary: The best I can find
review/text: For a long time I had been buying my green tea directly from China, they have a wide number of really great teas that are among the greatest tasting teas in the world. For many years I had searched the US tea market for some green tea I could get in a convenient tea bag so I can take it to work. I finally discovered this tea, and the reason I tried it was because of the name Monkey King, which is one of the teas I get from China in full leaf form. I also wanted a tea that I would not need any sweetener to mellow the taste. This tea fits the bill all around. It is not overly strong or bitter; I steep mine for 5 minutes, and is perfectly enjoyable as is without a hint of sweetener. That was a plus for me. I have gone through several boxes of it so far, and never tire of it.<br /><br />If you like good green tea, you will not be disappointed. I am at the point now of trying a few others from Numi as well.

I bought this from Amazon because it was getting hard to find it at my local Wal-Mart.

review/text: I should preface my review by saying, i am not a fan of floral teas. At all.<br /><br />Everytime I give them a try, I feel like i'm drinking perfume.<br /><br />My grandpa, who also let me try the Numi Puerh he had, also had me try this Jasmine green tea- thinking he could convert me.<br /><br />I'm not going to say i'm a convert but this is by far the only floral tea i have ever enjoyed. It's the first one that didn't taste like a bottle of Liz Claiborne had been dumped on top of it.<br /><br />If you happen to like floral teas, i would try this one out. If you're not a fan, try it out. You may be surprised. Just like I was!
