review/summary: Keeps Flakes At Bay
review/text: It does work at keeping dandruff in check, but there are a couple of brands out there that I feel do better, even though they're 2-in-1 shampoo plus conditioners. But if you don't like 2-in-1s, like I didn't use to, this is a decent shampoo without too strong a scent that doesn't dry out your hair or scalp too bad.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I really like this shampoo. It has a nice consistency...not too thin, as so many shampoos are. It has a nice scent, and it seems to work well. I don't really have much trouble with dandruff, just a little dry scalp from time to time, but I haven't noticed any issues since using this shampoo. So far so good!

review/summary: This Shampoo has no methol (cooling sensation) only
review/text: This shampoo out of the selection is only missing one ingredient: menthol. This ingredient gives the cooling sensation in the rest of the products (complete care, sport mint, clean and refresh, and the rest). Literally every product has the same type of ingredients except this one. I didn't try one out yet, but just putting it out there. I am assuming that the amounts of the ingredients in each of the types are varied.

review/summary: Prevents itchy scalp and flakes, leaves your hair super soft
review/text: If I use the wrong shampoo it will make my scalp itchy and will cause flakes. A lot of the time shampoo will make my hair feel very oily too. I am very selective about what type of shampoo that I use since many of them do not agree with my hair and scalp.<br /><br />I typically use an Anti-Dandruff shampoo about half of the time and then a regular shampoo the other half. This shampoo has a nice scent but not over-powering and it lathers very well. It's also a thinner consistency than most shampoo.<br /><br />There are two things about this shampoo that make it really good. First of all it has twice the Pyrithione Zinc as many Anti-Dandruff shampoos which makes it very effective. It also moisturizes my hair very well and leaves it very soft and manageable. As long as they keep the price competitive then this will be a popular choice for me.

review/summary: EFFECTIVE CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY
review/text: Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is an effective dandruff shampoo that packs the power of Pyrithione Zinc and a "Bio-Nutrium 10" cocktail of nutrients, ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins, almond & coconut oil. It is effective from the standpoint of control of my dandruff, but not a cure and may take a few rinses to get it all out during each treatment, and it leaves a tingle with a neutral fragrance. Definitely Recommended. Three and a half EFFECTIVE Stars! (12.9 fl oz plastic bottle.)

review/summary: good anti-dandruff shampoo
review/text: This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear. Overall, this is a good anti-dandruff shampoo and I would recommend it.

review/summary: Simple Shampoo that Works Well
review/text: I am looking to replace my store brand dandruff shampoo and my coal tar shampoo with something that will work better and be cheaper.  I am looking for a basic dandruff shampoo without a lot of extras. I tried the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand which I like but I liked the name of this so I figured I<br />would give it a try.<br /><br />I am pleased so far. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. The perfume like smell in many shampoos which I don't like is not as strong as I thought it would be and after I am done washing my hair I don't notice any lingering smell. A little of this product goes a long way.<br /><br />Interestingly, both this and the  2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this this brand use the same active ingredient, Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), to treat the dandruff. I have not looked at the other ingredients but the the 2 in 1 shampoo is also a conditioner while this one says it is just a  dandruff shampoo.<br /><br />The web page on Amazon says under directions that this product should be used twice a week but the bottle says to use it daily. I have used it daily.<br /><br />So far I am pleased with this. If I can use this instead of my two other shampoos I will save money as well.  I like it a bit better than the 2 in 1 Dry Scalp Hydration version of this brand but both are fine.

review/summary: Smells great, cleans well
review/text: I really like the way this smells.  It has tea tree oil in it, but it's not strong smelling.  I like tea tree oil in my shampoo because it really helps repel any lice and sometimes I am around kids that get it.  I've been putting a few drops in my shampoo for a long time and have never had a problem so far.  This shampoo has rich lather, and it feels very luxurious.  It cleans well.  It really only have problems with dandruff after I color my hair, and it has kept this from happening so I am pleased with that.  I would continue to use it the week after I color.  I didn't particularly notice any difference in fullness though, and it seemed to be a tad drying, so I probably would not use it every day on my long hair.  I do love the smell though - it's not sex specific - it doesn't smell 'like a man' or 'like a woman' - it's just a good natural clean smell.

It would probably be fine if you followed it with a conditioner, but on its own it's a bit to harsh for my needs.

I was a little disappointed, as I had pretty high expectations of some fabulous new product. But it works, feels pretty good and has a very faint slightly pleasant aroma. If you use two of the traditional products, give it a try.

review/summary: Basic Dandruff Shampoo
review/text: The Clear brand dandruff shampoos seem to be everywhere now. They use pyrithione zinc to control dandruff, similar to other brands, but cost a bit more in my experience. If they work the same for dandruff control, then they can only differentiate themselves in fragrance, texture, and cleaning.<br /><br />FRAGRANCE<br /><br />Typical dandruff shampoos smell medicinal, but not bad. More expensive shampoos often have really strong invigorating smells like mint. This shampoo (Strong & Full), with a price between the two extremes, also has a fragrance somewhere in the middle. It smells good, but is also very subtle.<br /><br />TEXTURE<br /><br />Another review nailed the texture as "melted ice cream." More importantly, it lathers well enough, though it is a bit hard to spread through long hair.<br /><br />CLEANING<br /><br />My hair feels clean, but not squeaky clean.  It is similar to other creamy dandruff shampoos in this aspect.  Conditioner is not included, and if you normally use it, you will want to use it with this product as well.  My hair felt pretty dry after this alone.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />Clear Strong & Full shampoo is a very standard shampoo, seeming to excel at being middle-of-the-road in every aspect.  It will probably neither excite or disappoint you.

review/text: A great shampoo.  What's so nice about it is it how it feels like a scalp "treatment" (which, in essence it is).  The ingredients work nicely in concert to create an almost "tingly" feeling that I like in herb-based shampoos.  Tea tree oil (seemingly the panacea for the 21st century) ginseng and spearmint give it an almost "drinkable" quality (don't!) and my hair and scalp smell and feel great!

review/summary: Strongest tea-tree smell of the Clear shampoos - works well but needs conditioner
review/text: I have recently had the opportunity to try all 5 of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy varieties.  I had all 5 bottles lines up in my shower, but of course, I couldn't try them all at once because some of the performance is based on cleaning ability, feel of hair afterwards, and lingering smell.  So over the course of a week, I tried each shampoo to rate them.  Meanwhile, my bottles of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCUTKI">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner with pump 33.8 Fluid ounce</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009KN8UA">Neutrogena Therapeutic Shampoo, Original Formula, 16 Fluid Ounce (473 ml)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043OYFJQ">Head & Shoulders Itchy Scalp Care with Eucalyptus Dandruff Shampoo 14.2 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> watched in fear.<br /><br />All of the Clear Men Scalp Therapy feature Pyrithione Zinc, the same active ingredient as the classic Head and Shoulders.  It is an effective medicine for controlling dandruff.  Clear Men brings the advertised "bio nutrium 10", a self-proclaimed blend that includes ginseng, tea tree, and mint.<br /><br />The shampoo color is white (not blue like H&S), and is a little bit more runny.  However, on applying it to my hair I found it was thick and felt almost like conditioner.  It is not sudsy at all but does cover the hair very well.  Despite the label saying "strong", you don't feel a tingle or cooling sensation.  Rather, you get the strong smell of tea-tree oil which can be good or bad depending on your preference.<br /><br />The shampoo rinsed out clean and it seems to do a good job controlling dandruff, but I noticed that an hour later, I could still smell tea-tree oil in my hair.  The other Clear Men's products did not linger so long.<br /><br />I like the Clear Men's line, but this particular formulation was not my favorite.  I didn't get a strong feel while on my scalp, but the smell seemed to follow me for hours.  I also needed to use conditioner afterwards as it seemed to strip my hair of volume and shape.  It doesn't claim to be "2 in 1", but even as regular shampoo, I was surprised.<br /><br />I recommend you look at one of the other fine Clear products I reviewed.  3 stars.

review/text: This shampoo is supposed to be for men, but the ladies in the house have used it and basically we have all come to the same conclusion. It is a fresh, clean smelling shampoo. As for dandruff, it really does not seem to work as good as the stronger selsun blue.<br /><br />On this bottle it says it has ginseng, tea tree and natural mint - none of those fragrances were apparent to us. The shampoo itself is extremely thick; it takes twice the amount of time to rinse out as most other shampoos. It almost feels and acts like it has some conditioner in it. Our hair does seem thicker and fuller. I really cannot say that it is worth the extra price than most other shampoos, but it still is a good shampoo, just not necessarily a good dandruff shampoo.

review/summary: A comparison
review/text: I've been given the opportunity to review four different Clear products. The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007RTR9G0">CLEAR SCALP & HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Ultra Shea Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil, 3 Fluid Ounce</a>, is not a shampoo product so I've reviewed it separately. The other products are different formulations of a men's dandruff shampoo:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AGC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Cool Sport Mint, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449EC">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Complete Care 2in1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo & Conditioner, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full, 12.9 Fluid Ounce</a><br /><br />DH has fine, straight, fast-growing, oily hair and really flaky scalp. I have very fine, curly, dry hair with itchy but not as flaky scalp. (I'm trying to woo DH away from the Head and Shoulders, which has dyes and chemicals that the Clear shampoo does not.) The Clear shampoo appears to have the same active anti-dandruff ingredients as Head and Shoulders, but it also has some very nice scalp-nourishing oils and vitamins. In my comparisons below, I'm going to focus more on the different feel of the different types of shampoo and how they leave my hair feeling because the anti-dandruff effects are going to be cumulative across all of them.<br /><br />I tried the Cool Sport Mint first, and it's what I used to knock back the oilness of the Ultra Shea oil (see my review). The fragrance is for men, but it's not a strong fragrance. It smells just fine on a woman! The mintyness is mild. I lathered up and let the shampoo absorb into my scalp for a few minutes (it felt good!), then did what I typically do with my shampoo...spread as much of it over my upper body as I could scoop off my head to save on soap before rinsing. The mint shampoo felt quite invigorating on my skin, more so than on my head, but not as much as Dr. Bronner's Peppermint. I like the way this Cool Mint shampoo feels. After using it, my scalp felt a little less itchy. It didn't do much for my dry hair, however, but it did leave it pretty soft.<br /><br />The next formulation I tried was the 2-in-1 shampoo/conditioner. That worked with my own hair better but probably would not be as good for someone with oily hair (like DH). It has just enough softening power to untangle my curls and leave them soft without weighting them down like some conditioners do. After just three uses of these two Clear shampoos, my scalp feels a lot better.<br /><br />I am still waiting to receive the Strong & Full product, so I will chime in with how it compares to the others when/if it comes. It looks from the ingredients list that many of the ingredients are the same as the products I already have, but it seems to be designed more for oily hair. Maybe by the time it comes, DH's bottle of Head and Shoulders will be gone and I can get his opinion on it.<br /><br />Now, the last thing I'm going to say about these Clear shampoos is that I just love the packaging: a handsome designer-looking bottle. The design of the cap requires only a quick press of the thumb to flick open the lid to squirt/pour, and another quick flick to close it. You can, with some effort, remove the cap if you want to refill it with something when it's empty. (I don't like to buy anything in plastic unless I can reuse it for something, and this bottle is going to be perfect for filling up with dishwashing liquid that I buy in large containers at Costco plus other non-food liquids of shampoo-like consistency. Tempera paints, maybe.) The company even thoughtfully provided labels that stay on well but that you can fairly easily and cleanly remove just by getting them started and then peeling them off in one big piece&mdash;so when the shampoo is gone, you don't have an ugly "branded" or sticky bottle.<br /><br />The bottle is #7 plastic, however, which means the plastic was invented after 1987, and it's not recommended to put any foodstuffs into it. Like some other plastics, some #7 plastics release BPA; however, many medical and dental appliances are made of #7 plastic so I'm not going to worry about it if I'm using it for cleaning products.

review/text: My husband has been using Head & Shoulders shampoo and conditioner for about fifteen years, so he was a little reluctant when I offered this to him to try out, but he gave it a shot. One shower was all it took to switch over, but he used it for two weeks before I wrote this review.<br /><br />First off, it works on the dandruff, and at least as well as Head & Shoulders did. In two weeks, we haven't seen a single flake, which I personally think is a step above the other stuff.<br /><br />Secondly, unlike his old brand, this doesn't dry out his scalp. It's also a lot gentler on his hair, and we can both feel a huge difference in softness after each shower from what it was like before.<br /><br />And, finally, the smell. In my husband's words: "Both brands had a chemical smell, but Clear actually smells pretty good." As his wife, I wholeheartedly concur!<br /><br />We got the first bottle for free, but we will absolutely be buying this in the future!

review/summary: really like this shampoo
review/text: The dandruff shampoo market just got a lot more competitive with the release of CLEARN MEN SCALP THERAPY.  I really like this shampoo because works great and will rivals the quality of any other similar product I have tried.  Of the various CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY shampoos, I think this one has the best sent (although several do smell really good).  I would definitely recommend this product.

review/summary: Another good Clear product
review/text: The scent of this Clear Scalp Therapy shampoo is very pleasing to me.  It's subtly sweet but not overbearing, and it certainly doesn't smell very manly.  Which is good since I am not a man.  It doesn't smell anything like other dandruff shampoos do.<br /><br />The shampoo is a thick white cream that lathers quickly.  It leaves a nice softness in the hair, which makes the hair easy to comb through afterwards.  I gte no itchiness off of this product.<br /><br />This shampoo came double-wrapped in plastic and a small cardboard box.  This is the only Clear shampoo I received that came packaged this way.  I noticed no leakage.<br /><br />If only it weren't so expensive!

review/summary: Works well, smells great!
review/text: I use Head and Shoulders b/c I have moderate dandruff.  This shampoo works just as well against the dandruff.  It is thicker than Head and Shoulders, so I only had to use a small amount (about the size of a dime-I have a short haircut).  It smells less like soap/shampoo and more like cologne, which is nice.  It lathers VERY well and leaves my hair clean feeling, even a day after. Overall, I think I am going to switch from Head and Shoulders!<br /><br />Packaging Note: If you plan on ordering this on Amazon, be aware that it may leak in transit-Mine did leak a little bit, it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn't get all over the box/other items, but it was still messy and needed some rinsing off when I took it out of the box.

review/summary: Decent, similar to Head and Shoulders
review/text: I've got a bit of a dry scalp sometimes and have tried a number of products to help control the dandruff problem and this shampoo reminded me of Head and Shoulders. It does have a fragrance to it which I would rather it not but it is not over powering. If this shampoo stays on the lower side of the price range of head and shoulders I could see using this. If not I'll probably just stick with head and shoulders.<br /><br /> I did have the same issue a number of other people reported in shipping of the shampoo where it actually was leaking in the package. I hope that CLEAR or Amazon remedies this and pads the shampoo better to prevent leaking. I'll attach a picture to this product page so you can see the shipping issue.

review/summary: Great for my hair
review/text: This is the second Clear product I tried recently. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JT7AIK">Like the one before it</a>, my hair really feels stronger, and I no longer have a dandruff problem. (I went through many different brands, including specialty ones, but this one is the best so far).<br /><br />In addition to the basic dandruff shampoo ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc), it contains several natural oil and tea extracts, which actually seem to work for my hair. Do not get it wrong, there are a lot of generic brand shampoos that has pyrithione zinc in them at shelves for $3, but the other stuff that comes with it makes them ineffective for me.<br /><br />While this is more expensive than other brands (and the case is smaller, only 13oz), it still is worth the extra cost. If you have a dandruff problem, or feel like your scalp is dying due to your shampoo, I would recommend trying this at least one.

review/summary: Too Strong and Full for Son
review/text: I had my teenaged son try this out, since the claim on the bottle stated it was specially formulated for men.<br /><br />This shampoo left a film that made his hair somewhat stiff, since it's ALREADY thick-shafted. It even had his straight hair curling up a bit. My son didn't like the feeling, even after washing it off, it didn't immediately go away.<br /><br />The smell in the bottle had a strong "manly" scent, but on his head-I guess it didn't agree with his body chemistry...the smell wasn't as delightful.<br /><br />For fuller, already strong hair...we recommend another shampoo in the line (the cool mint by same maker worked great!)

review/text: I have seen the commercials for this shampoo, and I was excited to try it.  I have not ever really had a problem with dandruff, but I was searching for a new shampoo, and thought I would try this one.<br /><br />First of all, I really love the smell.  It is almost a sweet smell, but not too strong.  Many other men's shampoos I find to have a strong and almost medicinal smell.  I really like this one.<br /><br />Although I cannot comment so much on the dandruff side, it cleans and makes my hair and my scalp feel good!  I would buy this product again.

review/summary: Come Join Me In My Shower
review/text: Well don't REALLY join me in my shower - just virtually join me while I describe this shampoo. It's thick and rich enough that a little is all you need to use, and it stays in your palm until you smack it on your noggin and start scrubbing. I also give points for the bottle design, which is easy to grip, squeeze, and close with one hand.<br /><br />Despite being an anti-dandruff shampoo, it doesn't feel harsh - nor does it have a medicinal smell. In fact, despite some reviews mentioning the perfuming ingredients, I didn't really pick up a strong scent at all.<br /><br />As far as its ability to control dandruff and flaking, I'm not particularly knocked out. Perhaps it's effective if such flaking is only from dry skin, as the shampoo seems like more of a moisturizer than medication. But for that same reason, it leaves my hair feeling slightly greasy (albeit looking nice). Overall not a bad shampoo, but not my first choice for actual treatment of an active dandruff problem.

review/summary: Poofy hair, itchy skin, dry scalp
review/text: I'm not sure if I am having a minor allergic reaction to this shampoo or if this is really not a good shampoo.  It causes my scalp to itch for about an hour after I use it.  I also used it to wash my sideburns which was not a good idea as it dried out my face and caused me to itch there also.  While my hair did feel clean, it also cause it to become poofy and not lay flat.  I don't have terrible dandruff so I am not sure if it is more effective for a person with bad dandruff.  Overall, I would not recommend this product and I probably won't even end up finishing the bottle.

review/summary: I wore a black shirt today.
review/text: Unfortunately, I am one of those people with dry scalp and I have to use a dandruff shampoo. When I saw this one, I wanted to give it a try to see how it stood up to my normal Head and Shoulders.<br /><br />First, the bottle is a really cool design. The top is easy to open and close with wet or slick hands as you might normally have in the shower.  The shampoo pretty much has the same color and thickness of other dandruff shampoos, thicker and white.  It suds up very nicely, so a small amount will do fine. The smell is floral, but faint, so once you rinse, you don't smell like a girl.  Just nice and clean.<br /><br />It is difficult to really review shampoo that doesn't stand out for something, but this one just doesn't.  It's utilitarian, it just gets the job done.  If I could be critical of anything, it would be that I wouldn't mind it having more feel on the scalp. Just a little tingle to let me know it is working.<br /><br />Would I buy this, absolutely.  Over all, I think it has done a better job of keeping flakes down than my previous shampoo.<br /><br />Update: I've been using this shampoo for about a month now. I wore a black shirt today and haven't had any problems with dandruff. I will most definitely buy this again.

review/text: This shampoo is white instead of blue and smelly, and I like that. It cleaned my hair and made my scalp feel better, and the container can fit in a corner of my tub or stored upside down when it gets close to the end. I may need to grab my glasses to make sure it isn't conditioner, though. All in all, I'd say it's worth it.

review/summary: Seems to work OK
review/text: CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo contains the same active ingredient (Pyrithione Zinc) as found in Head & Shoulders and other popular dandruff shampoos.  It appears be reducing the flakes and itchiness of my scalp, and I appreciate that it does not have an obnoxious aroma as some other dandruff shampoos I've tried in the past.  (In fact this particular product has no scent that I can detect.)<br /><br />I can't vouch that the "Strong & Full" properties of this concoction made any appreciable difference to my hair - but I admit to being a skeptic about most claims made of hair products.<br /><br />But since this has the necessary ingredients to control dandruff and no off-putting scent, I'd suggest that it's worth a try if you are unhappy with your current dandruff control shampoo.

review/summary: Arrived Leaking... Product is just OK
review/text: My order arrived leaking, which was an annoyance. That in and of itself isn't a reflection of the product. I wish "Clear" brand made a shampoo for men NOT geared for dandruff since my guys don't actually have dandruff. My younger son has a lot of trouble with hair breakage and thus thinning hair, so I hoped a shampoo designed for a healthy scalp would benefit him. He's been using the product every day and his hair seems to be tangling more. It isn't long hair, by the way.<br /><br />While Clear Men Scalp Therapy may be advertised as a shampoo for a healthier scalp, the product doesn't appear to work any better than any other shampoo on actual hair. If anything, it seems to leave hair drier than Pantene or even Suave products. Bottom line? I suppose if one's hair is on the oily side with dandruff, this could be an OK shampoo. Personally? I'd think other products would work just as well or better.

review/summary: Clean and Refreshing
review/text: I have been using the CLEAR MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for about a week. It comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The ingredients include: ginseng, mint, and tea tree.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. The shampoo is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. Any odor is not apparent to me.  After one week of use, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.  However, this shampoo seems to flatten my curls.  You may or may not like that effect.  On the negative side, the shampoo is irritating if you get it in your eyes.  Maybe this is caused by the mint.  Altogether, I like this shampoo and plan to continue to use it.

As a man, that makes me a little suspicious (especially with "perfume" being so high up the list), but this CLEAR shampoo didn't smell too strong.

review/summary: Would be 5-star without the fragrance
review/text: This product works better than any other product I've tried in years.  Why not a 5-star review?  Many companies have figured out that fragrances can be a problem for many people.  I'm one of those.  Look in the laundry detergent and fabric softener aisles at grocery stores - almost any product there these days has a fragrance-free version. I truly wish I could continue using this product, and actually did continue to use it well beyond the "comfort level" just to make sure it works.  It really does.  But the added perfume is fairly strong, and causes my usual allergic reaction to it.  If the manufacturer ever comes out with a fragrance-free variety, I'm sold.  It not only stopped dandruff, but scaly patches I've at best been able to limit with current and previous brands.<br /><br />If fragrances don't bother you, and you've got dandruff and/or scaly patches, get it!  For you it should be a 5-star product.

review/summary: It Works--No More Dandruff
review/text: When it comes to shampoo I'm a bit fussy.  I have added this product to two others that are favorites of mine.  I like to use them alternately.  I love Paul Mitchell's Tea Tree Shampoo because it feels great (the Tea Tree oil in it is refreshing), and I like Fructius's anti-dandruff product.  The Clean Men Scalp Therapy really works well in reducing dandruff and leaves my hair really clean and manageable.  It has a luxurious feel to it.  My only negative is that the label claims that it has mint, but you wouldn't know it.  You can't smell it or feel it when shampooing. I'm not sure exactly what makes this a man's shampoo.  My wife likes it as much as I do. Of the bazillion shampoos on the market this is one that, in my opinion, stands out as one of the best.

So, it works well as an anti-dandruff and does seem to provide the "healthier" hair look and feel.<br /><br />But if you're hair is fairly short and simple, you might not notice much besides the lack of flakes.

review/summary: Good shampoo, terribly packaged for shipping...
review/text: The Clear Men Scalp Therapy anti-dandruff shampoo is a good choice for dandruff control. I normally use Nizoral for my dandruff woes (with excellent results), but after using Clear anti-dandruff shampoo exclusively for 10 days, my dandruff has remained in check, so it definitely works. When I run out of my normal brand and have to switch to normal shampoo, I'll usually start to see flakes within days, but that didn't happen using this.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is rather thick and leaves my hair feeling great. Spearmint and tea tree oil are listed in the ingredients, both of which have very distinct (and often overpowering) scents, but neither is particularly noticeable here. Every now and then I'll think that I've caught a whiff of the mint or tea tree oil, but in either case, it's not noticeable if you're trying to find it. The scent is fresh and not overly perfumed. It does seem strong at first, but it rinses away clean leaving your hair much more subtly-scented.<br /><br />One thing I will mention that I hope Amazon improves is the packaging for this product. It came wrapped in a plastic bag in a bubble mailer. The top basically came open during shipment, leaving a good bit of the product squeezed-out into the bag. A small seal (just a bit of tape) on the edge of the top would solve this issue, that or shipping it in a box. Shipping this (or any liquid product) in a bubble mailer is a bad idea, evidenced by the fact that the shampoo was wrapped in plastic.<br /><br />Overall, I like this shampoo. It's not going to replace Nizoral, but since I only use that a few days a week, I can see this being a go-to product in the interim. It smells good, leaves hair clean and soft and keeps the flakes away. If you're reading this, I'm pretty sure that's what you're looking for.

review/text: After using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo (Strong and Full), I can vouch that it cleans my hair and appears to be keeping the dandruff away.  I normally use Head and Shoulders, and this product appears to be just as good. Normally, I do not really care about the quality of my hair, as I am a middle-aged man and hopefully past my days of vanity, although I am trying to keep the quantity of my hair intact for as long as possible.  So, my ringing endorsement is that it works at least as well as Head and Shoulders.

And then Clear caught my eye.<br /><br />I feel like I have itchy scalp sometimes, so I've given Clear a shot because of the scalp therapy. I've been using it for a few weeks now and I like it. I think it's too early to tell if the shampoo is truly helping my scalp, but it's not hurting. The scent is pleasant and I was initially concerned since a lot of shampoos "for men" have strong scents. I don't care for that.<br /><br />My hair feels good, I'm hoping my scalp feels even better, and it should be interesting how my hair reacts as it grows.

review/summary: I am a woman and I love this shampoo!
review/text: It smells SOOOOOOOO good and it is so creamy!  I don't know if they sell CLEAR products in the store, but if I see them in the store I plan to buy them.  As for dandruff, I haven't seen any so it may be working.  I am not sure since I also use the CLEAR scalp oil which may be masking the dandruff.  I also have been using a new conditioner CREAM of NATURE Argan Oil so I don't know if this product improved the condition or what, but my hair is not shedding like it usually does.<br /><br />UPdate: Clears up dandruff problems, but STRIPS hair color immediately.  If you have a hair color, I would advise not using this shampoo too much.

review/summary: Frequent use has made me a believer.
review/text: When I plucked a bottle of the new Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo off the Amazon Vine recently I must admit that I was extremely skeptical and harbored rather low expectations. For the better part of my adult life I had not been very particular about the brand of shampoo I used. For the most part I grabbed whatever was on sale. However, over the past couple of years I have been using my wife's Aveda Rosemary Mint shampoo and had been very pleased with the results. Now I must confess that when I sampled Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for the first time just a couple of weeks ago I was not particularly impressed. But a funny thing happened along the way. After several uses I discovered that Clear Men Scalp Therapy is a product that actually does what it claims to do. It has virtually eliminated dandruff and flaking from my scalp. Truth be told I couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />According to the manufacturer Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is a unique blend of 10 nutrients including Ginseng, Tea Tree and Natural Mint. Whatever is in this product it is certainly working very well for me.  I cannot tell you how many shampoos I have tried over the years that left embarassing flakes on my scalp regardless of how long I rinsed. In fact, I firmly believe that a good many of these products actually contributed to the problem!  Unilever recommends using this product on a daily basis for best results. I have been using it about three times a week and find that this is just about right for me. This shampoo lathers up nicely and rinses out easily leaving my hair soft and manageable.  My only criticism of this product is the scent.  While it certainly is not disagreeable I much prefer the scent of the Aveda Rosemary Mint Shampoo that I had been using.<br /><br />For the time being I plan to continue using Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo. My complimentary bottle should last me a couple of months.  Perhaps my impressions will change over time but as of right now I am extremely pleased with this shampoo.  As such, this is a product I am happy to recommend.

review/summary: Clean scalp
review/text: I have a fairly severe case of dandruff which I have only minimally controlled over the years with an anti-dandruff shampoo.  It cleaned away the scales and conditioned my hair but the effect was only for a day or two before the dandruff reappeared.  So it was with anticipation that I tried CLEAR Anti-Dandruff shampoo for the first time.  I immediately saw the difference: my scalp was clean and remained so for days.  It is recommended that the product be used twice a week, but I have found that once every seven days, with use of another anti-dandruff shampoo once or twice in between, is sufficient to ward off scaling.  CLEAR is a thick white emulsion which results in a substantial lather.  When rinsed, hair and scalp are left free of residue.  I'm happy to recommend the product and intend continued use.

review/summary: An Outstanding Product !
review/text: Very few such products I've ever used have--regardless of formulation or cost--given such rapid and enduring relief to common scalp health problems. And only a very small amount--quarter-size, in fact--is needed to yield substantial results when used at least twice weekly. This one, even without the conditioner of its "sister" formulation is terrific.

review/summary: Better than most OTC shampoos.
review/text: I have a problem with dandruff and I don't know why. My doctor called it "cradle cap" and gave me a prescription shampoo that made it much worse. So I don't think he knows.<br /><br />I've tried a variety of over-the-counter shampoos that have a slight effect. This Clear shampoo does more to help me than any of them. It's not a cure, but it gives me relief from the itching. I've been using it once a day; maybe I should try twice a day.<br /><br />Amazon's packaging for shipping was poor. You need more than just a padded envelope to protect a bottle of liquid. The leakage was contained by the additional plastic bag Amazon wrapped the bottle in, but it needs to be shipped in a box.<br /><br />I see someone complained about the fragrance. I don't understand that--I can't even remember what this shampoo smells like, that's how mild the fragrance is.<br /><br />Overall, I'll keep using it until I stumble onto something better.

I currently use Anthonys shampoo in the green tea for dry hair.  My current shampoo never helps so my hopes were low for the Clear Men.<br />After one use pf Clear Men the dandruff was done and it has not returned.  The shampoo has a very strong green tea smell and the shampoo itself is thicker than my normal shampoo which creates alot of suds when you apply.<br /><br />This is a great Anti Dandruff Shampoo and works better than expected.

Like many, I'm a long time <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001F51RNI">Head & Shoulders Classic Clean Dandruff Shampoo 23.7 Fluid ounce (Pack of 2)</a> guy. But I'm always open to other solutions. For the time that I have been using the shampoo, it does seem to be doing a good job at handling my dandruff. At least as well as the old standby, H&S. The bottle says its scent is a mix of ginseng, tea, and mint. Its a good blend, pleasant - without being overpowering. With the product being relatively new, Amazon seems to be trying to price it competitively. The bottle itself has a convenient, self-contained flip top that dispenses the shampoo easily without spilling too much out at any one time. If I have any gripe, its that the bottle does seem to be smaller than those I am used to, so there's less product.

review/summary: Tea Tree Oil works!
review/text: A certain male member of our family has extreme difficulty with dandruff, so much so that ordinary shampoo is out of the question, and even normal dandruff shampoo does not work.<br /><br />For years now, we have favored the shampoos containing tea tree oil, as this particular substance is especially healing and soothing for skin problems, and that (naturally) includes scalps that need soothing.<br /><br />For a while, the only reliable product we could find was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010LIYNS">Paul Mitchell Tea Tree</a> Oil shampoo, which we first spotted in a SuperCuts store. It worked wonders, even without the conditioner. All it took was regular washing with this shampoo, and all was well. That product, however, does have one huge downside --- it's high cost.<br /><br />Next, we migrated to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LMBLTY">Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo</a>, which sells in our local store for about $4 a bottle. Much better cost-wise, and still far superior to the regular brand dandruff shampoos.<br /><br />We are pleasantly surprised, though, with this item as well. I think the only way to make <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007K449CE">Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, Strong & Full</a> work in an extremely cost-conscious home would be to order the item by regular subscription, at a reduced price, with a Super-Saver membership. We don't have the latter, however, and without $25 of goods in any given order, shipping would run extra.<br /><br />In the end, we may simply stick with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LMBLTY">Trader Joe's Tea Tree Tingle Shampoo</a>, which as I say, is available locally, at a very reasonable price.<br /><br />But one thing is certain. Tea Tree oil WORKS on hard-to-treat scalp problems, and it does not leave men feeling or smelling as if they had been bathed in lavender or roses.<br /><br />Very good product. It is one I would definitely buy again, at the right price.

review/summary: Sort of good for me
review/text: I have used the CLEAR brand MEN SCALP THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo several times and have the following impressions:<br /><br />It works at least as well as the expensive prescription shampoo my Dermatologist has advised to treat my old age related dry scalp.<br /><br />The shampoo gets my hair clean and it smells `manly' in my opinion.<br /><br />It goes a long way and works up a good lather with only a small amount of the product.<br /><br />I have tried a dozen or so popular dandruff control shampoos over the years and this CLEAR product seems to be the best of the bunch--no flakes, no itch and less dry scalp.<br /><br />I guess my hair is stronger, fuller and happier, but I am not sure about that--yet.<br /><br />Using the CLEAR Anti-Dandruff shampoo every day, as recommended, is probably a bit much.  I have been using it every couple of days and that seems to be about right for me.<br /><br />The shampoo is supposed to contain botanical actives, including ginseng, tea tree, natural mint, vitamins B5 & E, sunflower, soybean, almond & coconut oils.  I suppose that is good to know.<br /><br />The price is NOT out of line with other high end shampoos.<br /><br />I have NOT encountered any of the problems with this shampoo that other reviewers have complained about--filmy coating on hands, poorly packed for shipping, over powering fragrance or shampoo induced headaches.  None of this criticism applies to the experience I have had with the CLEAR shampoo.<br /><br />I can recommend the CLEAR Anti-Dandruff shampoo for men, but with one exception:<br /><br />The shampoo does get my hair clean and has helped with the dry scalp,but it leaves my hair hard to manage.  It is fly away and seems sort of dry.  The scalp good--the hair not so much.

review/summary: I'm Happy With It.
review/text: I have been using this shampoo for about a week now. I has been using Head and Shoulders Clinical Strength for about a year with good results. Hate the shape of the bottle, though. I have also used Selsun Blue (expensive) in the past for years with good results.<br /><br />First think I noticed was that less shampoo (compared to the above shampoos) was required to get a good lather going. That is good because this is slightly more expensive then Head & Shoulders Clinical-so the bottle should last longer. I would say a quarter sized dollop or even slightly less was all that was needed.<br /><br />Normally, since I have oily hair I  need to do two washings. One washing is enough with this shampoo.<br /><br />The smell is very light and very pleasant.<br /><br />So far I have had no itching or shedding. This was a problem when I used Regular Head & Shoulders Dandruff.<br /><br />The texture after washing is a bit heavier-almost like conditioner was in the shampoo, but the bottle does say "Strong & Full, so it is adding body to my hair. You may be able to buy a bottle with out the added heaviness<br /><br />The bottle is easy to store in an upside-down position so the liquid flows out when you squeeze it.<br /><br />I would say that, if you have dandruff, you should definitely give this product a try.

review/text: I'm with the people who have given this product 5-stars. I've used it for a week now and I'm very happy with the results. For the price, you can't go wrong. I have had more expensive shampoos that I was less happy with. I really do not understand the negative reviews.<br /><br />I like the scent. I agree with the reviewer who said there is no residue. I have none. My hair comes out feeling very clean and the scent is not overpowering. My hair also brushes easily and I have noticed a reduction in dandruff which was, after all, the whole point of this exercise. I will certainly continue using it.<br /><br />The bottle is shapely and easy to hold. If I had any complaint at all about this product it is that it was leaking when I received it. Though inside a plastic bag, it had somehow squirted out, thoroughly coating the bottle and necessitating a good wash. The box was in no way damaged so I don't know what led to the leakage unless perhaps it was temperature or simply bouncing about in the box. I agree that it should have been better packaged.<br /><br />If, as the description says, 100% dandruff protection equates with no visible dandruff on combing, then this product meets the claims made.

I rotate them.  I like my hair to look very nice and full.  This shampoo has a mild, muted pleasant scent.  I wouldn't say it was manly or feminine.  Just basic clean without being strong.  I did get a slight tingly feeling, but almost not noticeable.  I noticed a difference in the feel of my hair after I used it as well.  The hairs themselves felt thicker and when I brushed my hair, it was manageable and full.  I like this product very much and will stop using H&S and switch to this for good.

review/text: This shampoo has a very stylish and high end bottle the gives it the look of being expensive. The shampoo itself is very thick and rich and a small amount works up a very good lather so it should last a long time because you only need a small amount per shower. It has a very nice strong fresh delightful smell. I really enjoyed the product and it solved my slight dandruff problem.<br /><br />While the shampoo bottle arrived wrapped very tightly, and it was sealed about as well as it possibly could have been, there was a slight leak of shampoo on the cap inside the plastic wrap but it easily washed off in the shower and was really not a concern.<br /><br />I highly recommend this top notch quality shampoo.

review/text: New shampoos are always a roll of the dice. Some work well, but over time, your hair goes flat, you build up residue no matter how well you rinse, etc. I'm pleased to say that this shampoo scores high on all levels.<br /><br />First, it's fragrance free. Those who are seeking a mango herbal rainforest aromatherapy getaway to their happy place won't find it in this bottle. I prefer fragrance-free, so that was the first "plus" for me.<br /><br />Second, a very small amount produces a full head of lather. I use an amount about the size of a quarter.<br /><br />Third, after you rinse and towel off and brush your hair...no tangles!<br /><br />Fourth, it really does boost the body of your hair. I have a full head of hair but it is fine. This shampoo really does maximize body.<br /><br />Fifth, I've used it for a week with no loss in performance. It's not a shampoo that starts off strong and fizzles out...it's a consistent performer.<br /><br />And finally, my "regular" shampoo is Head and Shoulders, and this shampoo does a comparable job of eliminating dandruff. One of my favorite colors is black and I wear it often...I'd know immediately if it wasn't working.<br /><br />I encourage you to try it, and I'm confident that you'll be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

review/summary: Good German M&uuml;sli
review/text: Strawberry Delight flavor m&uuml;sli is a great flavor for m&uuml;sli lovers. There are probably enough freeze dried strawberries for most people, but I would have liked even more. Some Americans might find the flavor not sweet enough or a bit bland, but this is easily remedied by adding sweetener. The product description is very accurate and I found it to be a good value.<br /><br />My favorite way to prepare and eat m&uuml;sli is to soak it in kefir overnight. This adds flavor and, for me, eliminates the need to add sugar or artificial sweetener. I highly suggest soaking it in yoghurt, kefir, or milk for at least half an hour and as much as ten hours in order to soften the grains and make them more palatable. This also reconstitutes the dried fruit and gives them better texture.

Contrary to the name/label of the product, "loaded with Strawberries", it is actually loaded with raisins and only has a small amount of strawberries. Also the strawberries are rather sour. We have enjoyed excellent muesli (several flavors) in Europe so bought this for home in US but did not really like this. In my opinion, raisins are filler product, often over-used in fruity cereals.

review/summary: best dog treat-- great for training---  all dogs love them
review/text: Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%

Assuming traditional month-day-year dating, that's almost four months past. Even if it's day-month-year dating, it's still close. I would not have even questioned the age of the product if the sticker wasn't there, but why add a 'best by' sticker if it's not needed...and why send it out if it's out of it's freshness period? Because I'm not the one consuming the product, I can't say if the product is bad or not, but I did notice that so far only ONE out of three of the treats I've used actually fits in the Romp n Chomp bone that I bought it for. This totally defeats the purpose of challenging the dog and giving him a treat that takes time to consume when I leave. Instead he grabs the refill treat and wolfs it down. Disappointing since he otherwise likes the bone. I'd hoped to be able to use it as intended with a treat insert once in awhile.

review/text: I first encountered these crisps a couple of years ago when visiting my sister in California. Sadly, I was unable to obtain them locally when I returned home.<br /><br />I have a sulfite allergy and have a difficult time finding packaged fruit that I can safely eat, so the Brother's Crisps were an exciting treasure. When I recently found them on Amazon, I immediately ordered a combination pack <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001942GAI">Brothers-ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana, 24-Count  Bags</a>, which includes the Strawberry / Banana Crisps, which have become my very favorite!<br /><br />These are "freeze-dried fruit" - meaning they simply have all the moisture removed from them. They remind me of the "Space meals" that were popular during the space era, and which are still available at some locations.<br /><br />Since there is no added sugar, the strawberries are tart, and as expected, the bananas are sweet. Together, they remind me of a "freeze-dried smoothie."<br /><br />With only 45 calories, this is a great little snack that packs a big punch, and because it is freeze-dried, it weighs in at about 1/2 ounce - awesome for hiking or backpacking.<br /><br />Each package contains approx. 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries.<br /><br />These are Peanut/Tree Nut Free * Gluten Free * Soy Free * Dairy Free * Non GMO * Vegan * and Kosher. And, Did I mention they don't have sulfites?

These are freeze dried fruits (nothing else added) which rehydrate in your mouth and taste yummy.  The strawberry banana pack states it contains approximately 1 banana and four strawberries.  I am not thrilled that it says "Product of China".  US grown strawberries and Latin American Bananas would be preferable to us.

review/summary: Love them!
review/text: I bought a variety box of these at [...] and my family has fallen in love with them.  My husband and I find ourselves snacking on these late at night after the kids have gone to sleep when we normally would have broken out the junk food. Our box had 10 apple, 5 pear and 5 strawberry banana.  The whole box didn't last a week. I ordered a box of the peach and plain strawberries from the company website. They also have packages with Hannah Montana or Mickey and Friends if that would help your children eat them.

review/text: i must say that the brother's strawberry banana crisps are really good.  Of the 3 brother's freeze dried fruits that i ordered this one is the best.  i would put apple second on the list (as pretty good) and peach last (don't even bother. if you want tasty dried peaches try cripsy greens. they have great flavor compared to the brothers. the little bit of $ you save isn't wrth the compromise in flavor)

review/summary: Yeah Airplane Travel Food!!!
review/text: Five weeks into 2010 and I have 5 round trips on United Airlines. These past two months I've been delayed a at least 5 times. Stuck on a plane with nothing to munch on is just no fun at all. Brothers All Natural Crisps come to the rescue. These little bags weigh absolutely nothing; they are almost as light as air. They are TSA super friendly, you can't take whole fruit in carryon luggage any more. They taste great and they are a healthy snack. These are just the thing to help get over those darn inevitable delays.<br /><br />This is the first time I've had freeze dried fruit in a bag. It's a bit of a surprise the first time you open the bag. The strawberry and banana smell is intense and fresh. Each piece of fruit is big. The strawberries have a clean natural strawberry flavor. They dissolve quickly in your mouth and are not the least bit gummy. The bananas absorb the strawberry flavor and have a bit of mushy flavor to them. The bananas do not have as clean a taste as the strawberries. The banana still tastes very good.<br /><br />In fact the eating experience is a lot like eating a real piece of fruit. These are nothing at all like fruit leathers or fruit chews that are gummy and soft.<br /><br />Grandpa and Grandson loved these. They are going to be a treat in the 13 year old's lunch. In fact the first night I had these, my son tasted them said he liked them. Then a few minutes later I left the bag sitting around and he asked if he could eat the rest. My son is a fairly picky eater, and he just flat out liked these.<br /><br />They are a good choice for lunches and traveling. Oh, and camping food - just about the most perfect thing in the world.

review/text: I love this brand of freeze dried fruits.  They taste so good and really sweet with no other ingredients besides the fruit.  The package size is perfect for a serving.  My 2 year old son was addicted to the Gerber toddler finger food freeze dried strawberry banana mix, and now he eats Brothers All Natural and I feel like it is an adult food with nice large flat pieces rather than little cube pieces.

review/text: I love the Brothers-All-Natural Fruit Crisps... I'm deployed in Afghanistan and there is not much fruit, so these are perfect. I have had multiple boxes before but these strawberry banana ones I ordered were disgusting. I had to spit them out and rinse my mouth out with water for about an hour and I could still taste it, not sure if it was the banana or strawberry. I checked multiple other bags in the two cases and they were all shriveled/brown so I threw them all away. Pretty disappointing.

Perfect for that afternoon snack when you're feeling tired and sluggish. I keep a box at work for my convenience, but they are easy to pack in lunches. I love that fact that even when strawberries aren't in season, I always have them to snack on. Best part is, no spoilage. They also provide 1/2 cup of your daily fruit requirements.  Try them, you won't be sorry.

Your little one will be able to eat these as soon as they can have the fruit that's in the package.  Only negative is that they get rubbery once the package is left open- best to eat right away.

review/summary: Great Straberry\Banana Snacks - Highly Recommended!
review/text: A friend recommended these Brothers Crisps and I am very pleased that we took her advice! Being a type 2 diabetic and trying to watch my carbs and calories, these are good snacks that satisfy my sweet-tooth cravings without overly spiking up my blood sugar levels. The real test with any "good for you" snacks is if my teens will eat them, and they also love them!<br /><br />These are made from real fruit (and nothing else) that has been sliced and freeze dried, making them crispy (exactly like "Astronaut Ice Cream") but they will reconstitute in your mouth if you leave them in long enough. This process also makes them very flavorful.<br /><br />Each Pack contains -<br /><br />Strawberry Banana:<br />About 1 Banana and 4 Strawberries per pack<br />45 Calories<br />8 NET Carbs (6 from sugar)<br /><br />The strawberries can be a little tart which is different and not displeasing to me.<br /><br />We bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027IACXI">Brothers ALL-Natural Variety Pack Crisps, Fuji Apple, Asian Pear, Strawberry/Banana - 20 Count Bags</a> and I like the Asian Pears the best, but all of the flavors are really good.<br /><br />These are a good tasting healthy snack alternative that, if it wasn't for the fairly high cost, I would keep on hand all of the time!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Note: These are made in China<br /><br />CFH

review/text: When I opened my first bag of strawberry/banana crips I immediately thought they looked like they belonged in a box of cereal.  Since I'm used to eating this type of fruit with frosted flakes and milk, I was a bit apprehensive about eating them on their own.  They tasted ok, a bit tart for my tastes, but the texture left a little something to be desired.  I shared some with my husband and a friend of mine and not one of us could really decide whether we liked them or not.  Unfortunately the 2 boxes I purchased have a quickly approaching expiration date so I'll either need to eat them soon or throw the rest away.  I don't think I would purchase again.

I don't really have a choice but to keep eating these cus I bought two boxes of them.

review/text: I decided to try this based on two things...  First - I was intrigued by the name.  "Foglifter" implied that it might have a nice kick to it.  Second, the reviews I'd seen (forget if the reviews were here or another site) were encouraging.<br /><br />The flavor is good, but it's very weak.  I feel like if I could take two k-cups to brew one cup of coffee, then I might be happier.<br /><br />I like a more robust coffee - like a Jet Fuel or a Dark Magic... or an Italian Roast or sometimes even a French Roast.<br /><br />If you're looking for a milder brew, this is very good.  But for me, it isn't lifting the fog hard enough.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Sweet Sticks are a Winner
review/text: John Wm Macy's crunchy snack sticks are great.  I have loved John Wm Macy's sweet sticks for years, the chocolate sticks are my favorite along with the java cinnamon sticks. If you like a light slightly sweet snack or some crunchy nibbles with your coffee you can't go wrong - my suggestion is to order in bulk. The chocolate ones are not offered on Amazon yet. And the cheddar stick and snacks  are good as well.  But I love the lightly sweetened cinnamon and chocolate ones better.  They are great for snacking or with coffee and breakfast.  MOST OF ALL  I love the products because of the ingredients.  I'm intollerant to margarines and palm oil products (which are in most baked things) and these are made with real butter. All my kids love them too (ages grade school thru college)<br />Every time I get them I have to have a box for my mother, grandmother and all the kids. They are low in sugar content and low in fat too. If you can't find them on amazon go directly to their website... [...]  Order with confidence<br />~Phyllis
