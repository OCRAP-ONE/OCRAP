review/summary: Inconsistancy
review/text: We have been buying Senseo Dark Roast for years.  Lately the quality has been varying - in batchA599269100 with a date of 11-24-12 - the resulting cups vary from great to watery.  Having used the Senseo for so many years, we can recognize when the coffee is going to be weak by the color of the flow.  The color varies from very light to dark in the middle of the process.  With the above mentioned batch the majority of the outputs has been light tan throughtout the run.<br /><br />This has happened once before.  We maintain our Senseo so the quality is not affected by the condition of the Senseo Unit.  Since I also have another Senseo at work, I took the pods to work to test.  Same result - watery coffee.<br /><br />I just bought 18 packages of dark roast if I continue to see watery coffee, then I guess its time to change from Senseo into another process.

review/summary: The Best Senseo Pods? I love my senseo
review/text: I've had a Senseo now for, wow, six years. It's not as cool as a Keurig, but the Keurig is slower, pods cost a lot more (when I last looked, a while ago now) and don't produce a better cup.<br /><br />There is/was a Blue Mountain pod, but I never tried it. I would rate a cup of this pretty much on par with what you would get out of a mid-grade Sumatra bean in a drip pot; maybe even as good as a French press. Of course, it's smaller...<br /><br />Comparing this with the rest of the Senseo pods, it's somewhere between medium roast and dark roast (in flavor), but softer and richer. It's well worth the extra expense (minor cost difference between this and dark roast pods). One of my favorite products period. I start every day with at least one cup of this.

review/text: Dont know why the medium roasted is pricier than the dark roasted.... but I gave the dark one a try. It tasted a little bit too "burnt" to me. It's ok if you like dark, but for medium or breakfast blend lovers, it's too bitter.

review/text: Senseo Espresso pads make a decent cup of coffee but I wouldn't call it espresso.  I appreciate the fact the pods are strong enough to make a decent cup of regular coffee and I admit I did not expect the pods to make the thick, rich cup of espresso I'm used to making with an old stove top maker.  This is fine for what it is, but it's not espresso.

review/summary: Quality has now gone downhill
review/text: I've been buying these pods for years, and have a "Subscribe & Save" program for them through Amazon. I like strong coffee, and these are the strongest I've found. However, today I opened up the first bag of my latest shipment and noticed the pods were very thin; had much less coffee in them. Sure enough, they made a VERY weak cup of coffee. Unfortunately, I'd upped my order recently to three months at a time, so I now have another 107 weak cups of coffee to look forward to. But I'll be shopping for a new brand.

I like the flavor of this coffee very much and hope it continues to be available, even though a subscription is not.  During the Senseo hiatus, I tried several other pod brands, but every one was too weak for my taste.

review/summary: Love the Kona Coffee
review/text: Senseo was pulled from the shelves at all the local supermarkets.  Everything seems to be going K-Cup.  Thankfully Amazon continues to carry Senseo.  Still making this in our $20 Senseo one-cup brewer, and with the senseo pods we are paying $0.37 a cup compared to $0.94 a cup from a K-Cup.  That is less than half (almost a third) of what you have to pay for a cup from a Keurig.<br />Able to make a single cup at a time, at a very reasonable price, and really like the Kona.  Plus I know that when the pod ends up in the landfill it probably won't last the hundreds of years a K-Cup will..Could not be happier!

review/text: I purchased two Senseo machines-one for home and the other for a vacation home-in 2004.  The ease of preparation, excellent price point and wide availability of the pods sold me on Senseo.<br />Sadly, it's now impossible to purchase pods in a common grocery store.  Although the coffee is quite good, the hastle of mail ordering has made me regret my choice.  If I must order online I would prefer a true espresso machine.  I am purchasing 2 Nespresso machines soon.  Senseo really failed me.

review/text: I'm not a food critic, and I don't differentiate subtle differences in prime coffee, but still, Senseo is MUCH BETTER than K-Cup.  It is just a no brainer - foamy coffee with rich flavor equipped with convenience makes Senseo a second to none.  I was very disappointed to see that no stores carry Senseo any more, but Amazon brought it back.  Thank you so much!<br /><br />Last night my wife and I found Senseo medium roast makes a great iced coffee as well.  Just pour coffee into an ice-filled cup, then put it in the freezer for about 5 min.  You'll see all those foams frozen!  Very cool. :)

review/summary: Do not buy Keurig, you are only helping them
review/text: Apparently, I am unhappy with the price jolt of this coffee, which I use daily. I am even more unhappy with the discontinuation of the coffee makers and the fact that the coffee pods can only be found on Amazon or on the senseo website for this new higher price. However, I really believe that even though disappointed, we should not simply go and buy a Keurig system. This heavy impractical and not-tasting-so-well system that flooded the US market in the past 3-4 years should not benefit and celebrate the pushing away of its competitor. I kind of believe that the whole thing is a scheme done on purpose so that Keurig can monopolize the market. And if everybody who is frustrated with not finding the senseo pods, jumps to Keurig, that just fulfills their goal.<br />As a cheaper alternative, use the Melitta pods. I just ordered them, have not tasted them, but the reviews said they are pretty similar. Let us hope so. And let us hope that Senseo will find a way to stay in the US market and even reclaim some of its lost presence.

review/text: I have a Senseo single serve coffee maker that has been working beautifully for years.  It uses recyclable paper pods that are like tea bags -- so there is no metal or plastic waste associated with the coffee.  The Senseo Dark Roast coffee pods make a very good, hearty cup of coffee.  My only concern is that the Senseo coffee pods are no longer readily available.  Most supermarkets no longer stock the packages of pods -- they allocate their shelf space to Keurig products.  I am happy that Amazon still sells them but only in bulk (a box of six packages, 18 pods each).

review/summary: Dark Roast Production Problems
review/text: Having used the Senseo Dark Roast pods for years, I was happy when Amazon got them back in stock.  But the coffee is now undrinkable--it is incredibly bitter; I ended up throwing it out.  To make sure it was not just me, I made a cup for a friend who LOVES the Dark Roast, and she also said that it was very bitter.<br /><br />Called Senseo.  The rep said that he had gotten other complaints of a similar nature: that the new blend was bitter.  He said that it might have been a problem at the factory, since the new batches were supposed to taste the same as the older batches.  (The former factory has closed down, and they are manufacturing the new batches in a different factory.)  However, the new bags also say "French Roast' not just "Dark Roast" so this may account for the difference--but French roasted coffee should not be bitter.<br /><br />For those who are concerned that the pods no longer say "Senseo" on the top, they are not counterfeit.  I was told that Senseo decided to eliminate the printing, since it made the pod fractionally thicker and some customers had problems with the top of the pod tearing.  Removing the printing would hopefully do away with this problem.  However, this is the least of my worries, since these pods will have to be thrown out and I do not have any of the older Senseo Dark Roast pods remaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: The following day, having written the scathing review above, I decided to open another bag and see if those pods were as awful as those in the first bag before I threw out all remaining five bags of pods.<br /><br />To my surprise, these pods were fine and the coffee tasted just like the older version.  Clearly there is a problem in the production in the new factory.  I did not want to open the other four bags now, since they would lose their freshness, but it is still possible that the coffee in some of those is also horrible.  But at least I feel better knowing that Senseo did not change the formula for the Dark Roast.  Now they just have to get their production kinks worked out.<br /><br />Amazon, of course, was great in dealing with the problem.

review/summary: Hartz DANGEROUS smokey pork bones.
review/text: Please, please, all you pet lovers........do NOT buy this product. The Hartz smokey pork bones are hollow and splinter easily. I gave one to my Coton de Tulear this afternoon and a few minutes later I discovered the whole thing had splintered into small, sharp shards! I rushed him to the vet, had two x-rays taken (there were dozens of small pieces in his tummy) I received some medication and have to watch him for vomiting etc., for the next few days. If they are small enough to pass, it will be painful for him, but will prevent surgery.I've sworn off all treats, and feel just terrible.

review/text: i bought these for my shih-tzu and pom, the did ok with it, but they are rather flimsey, my pit bull got ahold of it and there were splinters every where, so if you have mixed dog sizes be careful of this one. Hartz has a nice big thick ribeye bone that walgreens sells for 2/$5.00 usually, these are thick enough that they do not splinter or break, and there is lots of yummy marrow in the middle that the small dogs can get to, try those.

review/text: Pastene Ground Peeled Tomatoes are always on my pantry shelf.  They are _fairly_ low in sodium (85 mg in 1/4 cup), have no peel as filler, and contain no nasty additives.  Having a rich taste, they are pulpy but still velvety smooth - ideal in traditional sauces or with a roast or stew in the crock-pot.  And no tinny taste, but then I always add a wee bit of brown sugar and cinnamon, and no one knows I used canned!

review/summary: Long lasting, and safer in my experience.
review/text: My dogs, and many of my client's dogs, inhale regular rawhides.  I was always worried about them swallowing big chunks.<br /><br />And I really hate flavored plastic bones, as well as veggie bones, since I've seen chunks of those being swallowed whole right in front of me a number of times.<br /><br />These have been by far the best solution for me.  It takes the dogs much longer to chew them, and they really have to work at it.  For all my medium to heavy chewers, these are my first choice.<br /><br />Having said that, nothing is 100% safe.  After chewing up most of the bone, a very food motivated chewer could the remaining hard chunk - which could be a serious problem.  That's why I tend to choose the bigger sizes (8" or 10") over the little ones (4"), and take the bone away when it gets to a swallow-able size.  I buy these in bulk.  The value compared to other types of rawhides is huge, even without a bulk discount.<br /><br />These come in flavors also.  This plain style, as well as the the chicken flavored ones, have not been messy at all.  The beef ones are not quite as tidy.

review/summary: Fantastic Low Carb Pasta! Highly Recommended!
review/text: This great teasting pasta is a diabetic's Godsend! Being a Type 2 Diabetic, I am always looking for ways to reduce my carb intake. Up till now that has meant avoiding pasta completely since a single serving of normal pasta has about 35 - 40 carbs. This has been one of the biggest impacts to my diet as we love Italian cooking. I was not sure about Dreamfields' claim to only have 5 carbs, but we gave it a try anyway.<br /><br />After having a full serving, my blood sugar levels only took a modest rise, about what I would have expected from 5 carbs (plus the 15 others from the rest of the meal)!<br /><br />It does cost more than regular pasta, but it is worth it to me to be able to eat pasta again.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!

If you're giving them out for a party be ready to deal with all the green ones.

review/summary: The HIT at Halloween !!!
review/text: I bought the fun dips and candy bars (100 to a pkg) among other candies for my trick or treaters last year. I usually have 300-400 trick or treaters. The fun dips were gone real quick. I let the kids pick out the candy they want and most were picking the fun dip over the candy bars.Delivery is as always ......very quick. Couldn't ask for better.

review/summary: Glenfarclas 25 is the sweet floral sherried heart of Speyside pushed to the limit in the wood.
review/text: When most people picture "scotch whiskey" as an archetype they are thinking of a malt sweet spirit with a floral sherried nose, a golden yellow color, and some oak in the finish.  Blends such as Johnny Walker and Chivas mix many malts (and varying amounts of spirit fillers to get at this ideal with clock-like consistency.  There are a number of pure single malts that embody this ideal, from Macallan to Glenlivet.  Most tend to be Speyside malts.  The limpid marble waters and sweet grain of the region exemplify scotch whiskey.  None, however nails the archetype's lightness, floral sweetness, and consistent mix of attributes more or more consistently than Glenfarclas.  Glenfarclas has an extensive line from moderately young to extremely old that are all clear kin and utterly archetypical Speyside scotch - every single one.  The sweet heart of the line are the 17 (perfect) and 21 (just a kiss older and richer than perfect) year old expressions.  Today I'm drinking the 25 year expression.  Is it gilding the lilly?  Does the extra age ruin the magic with too much wood or is it even a scooch better yet?<br /><br />Color: Light amber gold.  Just like "scotch" looks in the dictionary picture.<br /><br />Nose is Sweet vanilla sherry - simple "Scotch" - increasingly rich with time.  Toffee malt richness turns the aroma ambrosial with time (lots of time) in the glass.<br /><br />Light mouthfeel.  The entry is mostly sweet with straight malt sugars.  Expansion is broad but light and floral with vanilla from oak tannins which bring a pepperiness and a dryness in the texture.  Sherry and nougat and cake frosting flavors round into red fruits (cherry and red plum) as the midpalate blooms into honeyed splendor.  Finish is sweet turning tannin dry with a long tail of vanilla and honeysuckle and citrus (tangerine) that ends on a slightly bitter note.<br /><br />This is clearly kissing cousins with the 21 but there is a little more of everything... including that bitterness at the end.  Personally I'd stand pat with the 21, but I can see why the distiller pushed it.  There is definitely a perspective that the 25 delivers that is valid and delicious - just I feel the balance of attributes is best with the 21.  You might feel differently.  None of these Glenfarclases are big intense flavors.  All are gentle, sweet, and polite.  It's what Chivas dreams of when it dreams of scotch.

review/text: This baby is exceptionally cute for the 2003-2007 series.  She still has the magnet in her foot, so don't play with her on your hard drive =)  The hat is so cute too!  You can keep the plastic thing under the hat if you like.  I think it helps preserve the shape of the hat, but really, it's just part of the packaging.  I gave her a high educational value because somebody who owns this toy will probably be a My Little Pony fan, which teaches the value of friendship and cooperation, which I think is among the most important of things to learn early in life.

review/text: I'm vegetarian and prepare this soup with tofu instead of chicken, "Better than Bouillon" vegetarian broth and soymilk, and it is one of my comfort meals. I love the wild rice in this soup and the blend of herbs. My only complaint is that the soup arrives from Amazon completely pulvarized. When I buy it from other vendors, it's more intact. Nonetheless, this is a wonderful, creamy, sustaining soup and one I love and am glad I could purchase in bulk here.

review/text: I just received my order (Orbit Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 12) Sold by: Potential Dynamix LLC.  I was surprised to see the packaging which indicated "Limited Edition" with a bright green florescent sticker on each individual pack of gum.  I thought this promotion had ended months ago so the gum couldn't be very fresh.  I was totally correct.  The promotion was between 2/11 and 5/11, according to the writing on the pack; today is 7/25/11!  The gum was hugely stale; barely chewable. I will NOT order from these folks again.  This was blatantly bad business (selling an obviously stale product), like selling a "use by" date that is 1/2 year old!

review/summary: Why is the picture showing the 24 pack?????
review/text: Misleading.  The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack, whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $21.  Beware of misleading listings.<br /><br />Also, the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor.  Even fresh packs (I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run) can sometimes taste stale.  This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes.  Tasting all flavors, the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others.  I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001IZCY4Q">Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum, 14-Piece Packs (Pack of 24)</a>

review/summary: Fondant by Wilton
review/text: While getting started in the cake making business we thought with the brand Wilton we'd buy their fondant to use til we found a good recipe for our own and tweaked it.  This fondant works up well and looks great but the taste is nearly unbearable.  If it's for decoration only, it's as good as you'll use but for taste, absolutely the worst I've dealt with and everyone who tried to eat it said the same thing.  Duff's is probably the best store-bought I've used for taste and you'll actually crave eating it days after you've had a cake with it.  You can also get it from the original manufacturer as well for about half the cost.
