review/summary: Unique mix of crunchy dried fruit
review/text: Unlike the usual 'leathery' dried fruit, these freeze dried fruits are crispy.  All have excellent flavor, and are great for diabetic meal plans.  Some of the fruit is very fragile, and becomes powdery- however, the majority keep their shape.  Excellent, healthy snack :)<br /><br />Update:  For Pears...  (my review of the mixed fruit came up for this, so have to add, not do an individual review)<br /><br />The pears are good- but not as crispy as the other flavors. There are only 20 calories per package, so fit into a diabetic meal plan quite nicely.  They also have a gram of fiber per package (good for a 20 calorie item).  The pear flavor isn't really strong 'pear', but they're good. I can see reordering them again.

review/summary: Awesome healthy snack!
review/text: I like these so much I enrolled in the Subscribe & Save over a year ago.  It is not the cheapest snack, but I save money by ordering these in bulk through Amazon rather than buying these from my local grocery store.  There are no artificial ingredients or added sugars; this is just fruit.  Yet, this is a great portable snack that will not go bad sitting in your car, or your child's backpack.  I usually keep a supply in my car to satisfy my huger while driving home from work.<br /><br />I completely disagree with the serving size listed on the package.  It claims five servings per bag.  But, if you're eating these as a snack, you'll only get one serving out of a package, maybe two servings if it's for a child.  If you're using this on top of cereal or yogurt, then of course it will last much longer.  When the bag is empty, you'll find a bunch of fruit powder left at the bottom.  Don't throw it away, this makes a great topping for yogurt.<br /><br />This snack is not for everyone.  My kids and I love them, but my husband can't stand them.  These are not the consistency of other dried fruits, like raisins.  These are crunchy, just as the name implies.  You can happily crunch them like potato chips, or to make them last longer, eat one at a time, and let them slowly dissolve in your mouth, like a sugar cube.  Sweet without the guilt.

review/text: I've tried all of the Crunchies fruits, and these are even better than the strawberries -- which is what attracted me to the brand in the first place. No negatives (even the price is decent), though I'd love to see more fruits in their line-up, such as pears and peaches -- and citrus if they come out well from the process. Highly recommended.

review/text: These used to come as small cubes, they were delicious and the kids loved them. They now come as dry mango slices, the kids still love them. Ok, I eat them too. I think the previous formulation was slightly sweeter, and you could put it in cereal and the like, whereas the slices now are larger so you couldn't do that.<br /><br />Not quite sure why they reformulated them - they appear to have been out of stock for quite a while, and then when they were back in stock they are different. However, still good and still worth purchasing as a healthy snack.

Plus, buying them this way is far cheaper than a pack at a time from the convenience store!

review/summary: Freeze dried
review/text: I purchased these because I was curious to what all the different fruits would taste freeze-dried.  I realized that I'm not such a big fan of it because of the sudden transition from crunch to mush in the mouth.  I would rather have actual fruit that retain the crunchiness for me to enjoy as a snack.  However, I think these would be really good to mix into your morning cereal, both dry and with liquid, hot or cold.<br /><br />Half of these packages had a considerable amount of powder at the bottom...so I'm thinking I lost about 10% of the 1.5 oz of product.

Maybe I'll put in a recipe and hope it turns out better. If you can, I'd recommend try before you buy.

review/text: This has been our favorite coffee for years and have been ordering it online since it became unavailable in Seattle when purchased by Starbucks.  Although disappointed that the whole beans were no long available, we continued to enjoy the ground coffee until this last shipment.  This time the coffee tastes old and bitter.  Our automatic shipments are for three bags and we are now on our second bag, with no improvement over the first bag.  We will give it one more shipment before cancelling and finding a new brand, but do continue to hope for the best next time.  Please, Starbucks, don't ruin this flavor also.  You have great stores, but you tend to roast your coffee to death.

review/text: Decided to try ordering this to see what it was like buying food online from this company.  First, it took a long time to get to my house, longer than the expected day of arrival.  Secondly, when it did get to the house and I opened it, there were dents on some cans and one of them had opened from what seemed like being thrown around leaving meat inside and around.  It was really annoying.  I'll just stick to buying food at the market, it's a lot better since you actually get to see what you're getting.

review/text: This spice blend is my favorite. The spices blend superbly so there is no excessive pepper, garlic or "green" taste. I eat a low carb, low sodium diet and I find this seasoning is perfect for creating a crunchy, carb-free coating on baked (free ranged/hormone free) meats. It's also great in salad and egg dishes. I was a huge salt fan, but with this blend, I've  transitioned to a salt-free lifestyle pretty gracefully.

review/summary: Excellent spice.
review/text: This is an excellent salt-free spice. It has a really nice blend of flavors that go well with just about any dish. We used to use Mrs. Dash in a lot of our cooking, but while I like Mrs. Dash, it relied too much on pepper. I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LQO5RQ">Frontier Seasoning Blends Salt Free All-purpose Seasoning, 1.28 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)</a> and it is our primary all-purpose spice now. In fact, we've come to love it so much, we order it in bulk. I've also given this spice to several other people, and they have all loved it too.<br /><br />The spices in it are Onion, Parsley, Lemon, Basil, Thyme, Garlic, Celery, Red Bell Pepper, And Citric Acid. The spices are well-blended so that no one flavor dominates over the others. I also like this spice because it contains no oregano which I am allergic too. I highly recommend this to anyone who does a lot of cooking.

Not an amateur coffee drinker  I order 20 lbs. per month and frequent several area cafes.

review/summary: Tasty, high in sugar
review/text: These bars taste really good.  I doubt anyone would say they taste like a fiber bar.  They are chewy and flavorful without any hint of chalkiness.  You could easily pack these in a kid's lunchbox without them knowing it was anything other than the latest chewy snack bar.<br /><br />So: Pros: Fiber, Taste<br /><br />Cons: Don't confuse it with a health bar.  It's not.  It's sugary and mostly just a junk-food/snack bar that has been pumped with fiber.  But the peanut butter/sugar covers that up.<br /><br />Use it instead of your other junk food for a nice fiber boost.  The great thing is that it should satisfy your sweet tooth as much as whatever you're replacing.  But it's not an apple-alternative or anything.  It's junk food that has all the taste plus a little more merit, especially if you need the fiber.

Delicious and filling - the whole pizza is 420 calories.  That and a delicious salad with fat free dressing and I have a filling and quick dinner.  Love this stuff.  I must not be the only one - half the time when I go to Whole Foods for this particular Naan pizza, of the four varieties they carry, they are always out of or short on the Cilantro Pesto.  Why?

review/text: My 98-year-old mother isn't supposed to have much sugar but she needs to get a few extra nutritious calories and likes this. It costs more than the bulk drink mixes but she prefers the variety pack so she doesn't have to drink the same flavor every day and she prefers the packets because they are easy, convenient and she doesn't need to measure anything. I've pretty much tried them all and I like the flavors and mouth feel of Instant Breakfast better than the other drinks. The Instant Breakfast vanilla tastes more like vanilla to me than other brands.

review/text: I ordered this for my father, who is undergoing cancer treatment for throat cancer.  He is also diabetic.  In our area the stores either don't carry any sugar free or only the milk chocolate flavor.  he was getting sick of the chocolate flavor, as well as it being limiting in what could be made with it.  I looked online and all i could find were the big packages of this.  It was worth it, but keep in mind that you are getting a CASE of boxes of carnation instant breakfast, and not a box of packets like is pictured.

review/summary: Keeps Hubby Happy/Healthy!
review/text: Hubby grew up on this product and recently wanted retry it. I find it kind of ironic that it's indeed finding a resurgence lately.....Sunday newspaper coupons as well as TV commmercials for it. Since he's Diabetic, I buy the "no sugar added" Vanilla flavor [his favorite]. I tried a sip, and neither of us can detect an aftertaste, however we are both "no sugar added" junkies. Neither of us are ingredient experts so we don't know what gives it a sweet taste. But we do know it provides him with 21 essential vitamins and nutrients which he definitely needs for his very active job. I mix up a couple bottles @ a time [12oz bottles recycled from salad dressings], put in the fridge and he just grabs one in the morning on his way out the door to work. He can quickly dring a bottle on the run while working, and get some sustanence when he really needs it. The Subscribe/Save makes the price like $1.00 a box cheaper, no shipping costs, and we always have it on hand in the pantry. Love Amazon!

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: I used to live in Germany for many years. I miss the taste of good German cooking. Even if you don't read German, the directions are pretty easy to understand through the pictures. Mushrooms do not come in the packet. You will need to buy and slice about 1/4 pound of fresh or a small can. First, I fried some chicken. After removing the meat from the pan I added 1/2 stick butter. If I didn't have the drippings, I would have used a whole stick. In addition to mushrooms, I added sliced onions. Saute the vegetables in the butter. Add the water, then the sauce packet. Stir with a whisk or spatula until the sauce thickens, which is fairly quickly. Remove from the heat and let the sauce set for few minutes to continue thickening. I served this with Thai jasmine rice. I will try adding bell peppers the next time for a colorful variety. In German restaurants this is usually served with pan-fried pork cutlets. You can eat this with any meat cooked any way you like. Or, no meat at all, just rice or potatoes. If you are watching your fat intake, this may not be a good sauce for you unless you substitute the butter for a cholestrol-free margerine or spread. I prefer I Can't Believe It's Not Butter. Good luck and enjoy!

review/summary: This Stuff Is Amazing
review/text: I have been plagued with a biting red ant problem in a rocked area running the length of my driveway that actually started last summer.  I was reluctant to put poison down and hoped the Colorado winter would eliminate the issue.  The opposite happened and it has been impossible to walk down my driveway this summer without getting my legs swarmed by biting ants.  I covered the area twice with borax - which seemed to send them below ground just long enough to have Town Hall meetings and come out fighting mad.  In desperation I purchased 3 containers of this hoping to make the situation even a little better.  I sprinkled ONE container lightly over the area just to guage the effect.  I kid you not, ALL THE ANTS ARE GONE.  I keep checking to see if they will reappear with tanks and airplanes and cannons aimed at my garage, but they are GONE.  This stuff is amazing.

review/text: I used this product on a black carpenter ant colony I had living in a planter made of landscape timbers in the yard of a house I bought.  Every time you would mow around the planter, or trim around the planter swarms of carpenter ants would emerge from any cracks where the timbers came together.  I dusted the perimeter of the planter, taking care to dust in the cracks as well.  The next week when I was mowing/trimming, very few ants emerged, and the following week there was nothing.  I haven't seen any sign of ants since, so I assume it took care of them.  I have used several other Terro products, and I would definitely recommend them as something to try before calling the exterminator.

review/summary: an effective weapon in the arsenal...
review/text: In certain applications, Terro's Ant Dust can be an effective tool in attempting to control ants.  Contrary to what some have said, the dust does not kill ants on contact, but given some time, the dust does seem to be effective in combating ants, as they will generally avoid areas treated by the dust.  As the dust is white, it's usually easy to tell where the dust has been applied, unless the area happens to be white.<br /><br />After spreading the dust under bricks and various rocks where ants are nesting and egg cases are present, I found that there were no live ants in the area the next day.  When dust was sprayed into cracks in rock walls and sidewalks where ants were present, once again, no ants a day later.  The dust will keep them out of the area for a while, although how long depends on things like the weather.  The powder isn't quite `waterproof' as cIaimed, but it does resist watering or rain washing it away.  You may need to reapply occasionally.<br /><br />The thing about ants is that they are resourceful, determined, and relentless.  Unless the ants are killed, they almost never give up.  When this ant dust prevents them from taking a particular path, the ants will take an alternate route, if one is available.  Be prepared to either spread more dust, or kill the ants.  Unless they have no other options, they will probably keep coming.<br /><br />Of course, you always want to use this product in a safe and approved manner.  Do not apply it anywhere near where food is prepared, or where there is any possibility that children or pets might be exposed to it.  I only use it outdoors, and recommend wearing a surgical mask and safety glasses when applying, especially when there is wind.  Shaking the dust from the container works fine for some applications, but with the one pound can, you may not have a lot of control.  Applying the dust into a tiny hole or crack could be a problem.<br /><br />The dust is very fine, and can be applied as a spray, but the trick is that you will need to come up with a suitable spray container.  An empty nasal spray bottle, works well for me.  Enlarge the opening in the nozzle, and with a little practice, you should be able to apply the dust into nooks and cracks.  The dust isn't always easy to apply evenly, so I use an old toothbrush to spread it around when necessary.<br /><br />This dust probably won't wipe out the colony, but could be an effective tool for helping to control ants.  Ant colonies are generally sensitive to any kind of attack, and often will withdraw when they experience losses of life.  Good luck! :)

review/summary: My Terro cheer...Let's hear it for Terro, Terro, TERRO!!!!
review/text: This is the third Terro product we've tried this year.  The first, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HJBKMQ">Terro 300 Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits, 6-Pack</a>, proved successful in enticing carpenter ants to eat its tasty poison. You can see inside the 6-pack bait, and can tell instantly if the ants have been eating it. All 6 of ours were emptied within a day or two of the ants discovering its goodness.  So, we ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RNEVGY">Terro 1800 3-Ounce Outdoor Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Baits, 3-Pack</a> and were a bit dismayed that we couldn't see inside; however, we're confident our carpenter ants like it too.  But, every day, my hubby would say, "I don't like all these carpenter ants coming into the garage."  So we ordered Terro ant-killer in powder form. It works a bit differently than the liquid baits. The powder bait kills on contact, is waterproof and lasts for 8 months. Once the ants know how bad it is, they stay away from it. We have no more carpenter ants coming into the garage. We then put it around our home's foundation, and sprinkled some onto/into our railroad ties that the ants had taken up residence in...well, at least that's how it looked to us. The only problem we have is trying to remember to step over the poison, otherwise we track it into the garage...then into our home.  yikes! We must remember to clean our shoes off!  If you have pets or young children, well, any kids that play around the house, you might want to be careful where you put this powder.<br /><br />I like Terro ant killer enough to cheer about it!

review/summary: Kills... Bugs... Dead
review/text: I don't mind having lots of bugs in my yard as long as they stay out of my house and don't bite me.  I enjoyed a peaceful co-existence with the ants until they decided to break all the rules.  They attacked me while I was mowing the lawn, and invaded the house and helped themselves to the dog's food.<br /><br />This meant war.<br /><br />After doing my research, I decided to buy the Terro Ant Dust.  It was the cheapest, and had high marks from my fellow Amazonians.<br /><br />This stuff works.  I sprinkled it on the dirt ant hill, and watched the ants go crazy and die.  To speed things up, I poked their colony with a stick.  This made hundreds of them pile out of their ant hill and walk all over the white powder.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Terro Ant Dust works.  It doesn't look like the ants eat the stuff.  But, die they do.<br /><br />CAUTION:  Every single time I applied the Ant Dust, I took care to not get it on my hands, eyes, or to breath it in.  Still, I felt sick after each application.  Next time, I guess I'll wear a haz-mat suit so that I avoid all contact with the Ant Dust.<br /><br />UPDATE:  After 24 hours, most of the ant hills are without activity.  BUT - new ones have popped up.  Huge ones.  These ants are active.  I hit the new ant hills with more Terro.  Next step - Spray the entire yard with indiscriminate bug killer.  A man's got to do what a man's got to do!

review/summary: Works - recommended
review/text: I had ants tracking from outside the front door all the way to my kitchen.  This stuff took care of the outside ants within hours and there were no more intruders.  I also bought the inside liquid bait traps, but not a single ant got to those - this could be because it was late for the bait, or the outside stuff just demolished their track.  I did watch to see if they would continue to track, but after laying this powder down the ants all died or moved on.  I recommend this highly.<br /><br />One warning, this product is waterproof.  I went heavy on the application and that was a mistake - go light! - it will kill them!  I have some caked powder around my door that I have to clean up, but had I applied lighter, would not really be an issue.  This stuff works.  I bought it through Amazon and it arrived within a week.  Recommend.<br /><br />The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 is that it will not go away once applied, but as mentioned above I went heavy with the application - go light, and it will not be a problem.  Worthy of 5 stars for those who follow directions better than I.

review/summary: Does what it says: kills ants
review/text: If you're reading this, you're like me: you've got an ant problem. I've tried all the slow-acting poisons designed to "kill the entire colony" and met with varying degrees of success, but if you really want to keep ants out of your house to begin with, this is a great start. I'm a little wary of using it indoors, especially if you have pets, but trust me, it will kill almost instantly, and it will keep killing for a long time. Spread just a thin layer of this stuff around the perimeter of your house, and those ants will not be crossing that line of dust. It's just that simple. You may still need to take other measures if you have an infestation inside (I had decent success with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BQT5IG">Combat Ant Killing Gel 27grams</a>), but this product is a very good first step.

review/summary: Did not work for me
review/text: For almost twenty years we are in a power struggle with carpenter ant colonies that comes out of the woods and try to take over our log house. Until now I kept them at bay with borax and ajax scrubbing powder. While it does not kill the ants they really don't like to cross any treated areas. After reading all those glowing reviews I wanted to see if Terro would once and for all get rid of those pests. No such luck. I applied the 'killer' following instructions directly on a invading brigade and their surroundings. They did not even stop, flinch or otherwise acknowledge my attempt. Absolutely nothing, even hours later they were still advancing towards our home walking over this dust without any hesitation. When they finally came within critical distance to the house walls I got nervous. Out came the borax and the ajax and within minutes the ants were gone into hiding. They will like every year try to find another way to move in with us but I've got a stockpile and it is not THIS product. Sorry.

review/text: This stuff works great.  Place it anywhere you see ants and come back tomorrow, no ants.  I use this on the edges of my driveway and around the foundation of the house.  Don't want to be caught without it during the summer.  The only knock would be the 'waterproof' claim.  It will resist a shower but if it rains you will need to reapply.

review/summary: This has saved me a lot of money
review/text: I live in a wooded area and use Terro outdoors on the deck and the house and it has worked great since I started using it three months ago.  It seems everyone in this community pays a bundle for quarterly pest services but what we really only have trouble with are carpenter ants.  Why pay and spray all those poisons if you don't need to?  And, at Lowe's, I purchased a broom type device that's in the broom section and sprinkle the Terro on the furry end, it has a telescopic arm that extends quite long, that way I can reach the high parts of my house and spread the Terro powder way up there.  It's only $10 and you can identify it by the yellow furry top.  I hope this helps!

review/summary: Kills Ground Hornets
review/text: I read somewhere that Delta Dust (Deltamethrin) will kill hornets and that Terro Ant dust has this ingredient.  I purchased it and a plant duster.  Poured in the powder and dusted down the hole of the hornets.  It is killing them for sure.  I was seeing swarms before but in just 3 days of use, the population is definitely on the decline.  I used it on some ants too and it works on them very well.  The active ingredient is a cousin to permethrin, pyrethrin, etc., which are synthetics of the active ingredient found in Chrysanthemums.<br /><br />Delta dust has a long life on the ground as it is water proof so kills bugs for months.<br /><br />My problem is that in this summer drought (2011), wasps (hornets are of the same family) and other bugs / pests are drawn to our yard here in the country.  I have to spray new nests as they pop up.<br /><br />Cons: Can be hard to find.  I finally found some at a local hardware store for about 7 bucks (canister with sprinkler/pour spout).  The duster was found at a local seed and feed store.  It was about 10 bucks.

review/summary: WOW! What is this stuff??
review/text: Woke up one morning to a trail 15 feet long of sugar ants tracking from the patio into the kitchen. Every counter, cutting board, and every microscopic bit of fruit pulp was being swarmed by these tiny ants. We kept the problem at bay temporarily just by being very OCD about cleaning (above and beyond normal cleaning) every night and morning, but still the ants came in smaller numbers. The day I got this product I sprinkled it around the outside of the door that leads into the kitchen and then i used a paint brush to paint a very small amount of the product around the baseboard of the kitchen cabinets. Within MINUTES the ants started to disappear. I have not seen a SINGLE ant in the kitchen in 5 days. Its really amazing. In face it worked so fast that I am worried about how toxic it is or isnt! (It says safe for indoor use, and I applied a tiny amount using safety measures).

review/summary: This product kill ants instantly
review/text: I priorly ordered the TERRO LIQUID ANTS KILLER, ants digged the liquid. The first time I used the liquid, they were gone for 2 days, then they were back, even more than before. Then I added the liquid dose, a lot more came. This time they were here for over 48 hours, it was like ants invation. So I poured the TERRO POWDER over to the eating-the-liquid-the-moment ants. They were running away, however every single one of them was touched with the powder. 10 minutes later, only few of them were moving, half hour later, none was left. I felt terrible to do so, but there's no choice left for me, only by looking at them I feel itchy, not to mention when the time they crawl onto my skin.<br /><br />I am not sure liquid TERRO really kills the queen, because ants were coming back with more numbers. However the power does kill them, instantly, and other insects too. The minute when all ants were dead, I noticed a spider came from nowhere tried to grab the food, it couldn't reach them because the powder was too toxic for its kind.

review/summary: KILL! KILL!! KILL!!!!!!!!
review/text: I was very, very skeptical that this stuff would work, but after trying a number of 'eco-friendly' products which only seemed to create ever more thriving ant colonies on my lawn, I gave Terro a shot.<br /><br />It's quite easy to use: just shake it out of the canister directly onto the ant hill. If you can use a salt shaker to apply salt to your french fries, you have the ability to use Terro Ant Killer Dust.<br /><br />Ease of use is nice, but it would be nothing if the product wasn't effective... and that's where this stuff truly shines. All those dozens of little ant hills dotting my lawn, all those countless, busy little brown pests carrying food back to their colonies -- GONE, ERADICATED, ANNIHILATED -- THE VERY NEXT DAY!<br /><br />I am not at all wild about the vivid dots of bright white dust remaining on my lawn where I applied this, but it's preferable to the proliferating ant hills. The white dots are fading over time, and hopefully some effectiveness remains after they disappear. Next time I'll try to use less on each ant hill to see if I can minimize the appearance issues.

review/text: I hired a lawn care place to get rid of my ants but found out after $69 that it was only for those that happened to be on the surface. This product worked very quickly to either kill them or make them move on. It does only last for about a month though before they start showing up again. As other reviewers posted you need to dust carefully. It will stay white for a very long time if you just dump it out. I'd give it 5 except that the shaker does clog easily so you will have a hard time putting down an even dusting.

review/text: I tried Terro's liquid bait. While I saw ants drink it up and eventually die...and there seemed to be a decrease in the ant population...I still wanted a more aggressive solution.<br /><br />So I tried this power which is formulated with neurotoxin that only a mild irritant to humans and pets (except cats and fish).<br /><br />I gotta tell you...this REALLY WORKS. Unlike conventional pesticides which merely kill on contact, this kill and then keeps killing for weeks.<br /><br />I sprinkled it on a bustling ant community. Within seconds, it was like nuclear winter. Ants going to spasms. And then...complete stillness. Wipe out. Not an ant left alive. I came back after several days to that same spot. Complete and total victory.<br /><br />If you like instant gratification, try this stuff.

review/summary: Favorite "Annie's" Snack!
review/text: My kids and I have tasted several Annie's snacks, including the chocolate/vanilla bunny cookies and the cheesy bunnies, but these chocolate bunny grahams are our favorite by far!  They have a subtle chocolate flavor that isn't too sweet or overpowering, and the bunnies aren't crumbly or greasy.  My kids LOVE these (and I do too!).
