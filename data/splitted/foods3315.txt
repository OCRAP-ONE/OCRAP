review/summary: Definately culinary grade, but a decent buy
review/text: I bought this because I just couldn't see putting my good matcha into smoothies. To my surprise, it's not terrible to drink (and most of the organic matcha I've tried in the US has been). It's still mostly for smoothies and cookies, but also for off mornings when I won't appreciate the good stuff. (I certainly appreciate the good stuff more after one of those.)

review/summary: Strong Bitter Aftertaste
review/text: I bought this Culinary grade Matcha powder based on many good reviews but was very disappointed! I like to bake green tea cookies and cakes but unfortunately the bitter after taste just makes my baked goods very unpalatable (using 1-3 tsp per batch). I previously used a store bought Matcha from Japan which cost twice as much and was not specified "culinary grade" and compared the two. My store bought brand had a slightly lighter green color and a nice balance of flavor with no bitter after taste compared to SerendipiTea Matcha which blows you away. I will stick with the store bought brand in the future.

review/summary: Not My Cup of Tea
review/text: I didn't like this tea at all.  I prepared it according to package directions but it was very, very green and kind of thick.  I didn't like the taste but I will admit I didn't drink much of it.  I think I'll stick to the regular white, green and oolong tea.  I thought of making the tea "weaker" but didn't....I don't think I would have liked it any better :)

review/summary: Great gift
review/text: I purchased one of these for my girlfriend while I was in Afghanistan and she loved it.  She took pictures and sent them too me, It looks exactly as pictured.  she said everything inside was great. The yogurt pretzels were here favorite, she said they were outstanding.  however, the box she received did not have chocolate covered cherries in the top, instead they had been substituted with chocolate covered peanuts of a different kind than the others already included.  If you're away, you won't be disappointed sending this gift, it is very large and reasonably priced.  The only reason I give this four stars, instead of five, is that I feel as a substitute for chocolate covered cherries, she should have received something more akin to that category; perhaps a chocolate covered fruit of another kind.  Anyway, a great gift idea.

review/text: This product is a huge rip-off. The chocolate chip cookies were almost like astronaut food as far as consistency. I counted a total of 8 half-dollar size cookies in the package and 4 of which had only 1 chocolate chip each. The other food was of similar quality, appearing to be cheap processed junk food. For the price of this package and the amount of snacks received and quality, I say completely avoid this rip-off.

review/text: Like so many others, I had this tea on my first visit to Ireland.<br /><br />After my first cup, I thought, "this is pretty good!"<br /><br />After my second cup later, I thought, "this is pretty darn good."<br /><br />The next day I bought a box to take home.<br /><br />Then I started asking friends and co-workers to bring an extra suitcase on their trips to Ireland...<br /><br />Over the next 20 years I heard the same story from many others here, "I asked a friend to bring an extra suitcase..."<br /><br />I'm really happy that this tea is available here now, and my wife and I travel nowhere without bringing a sufficient supply of Barry's, as it really brightens our day in a way that is unmatched by any other tea (or coffee for that matter).<br /><br />This is the "tea bag" version, so some loose leaf tea drinkers may suspect that the bags are filled with floor sweepings, as seems to be the case with many other tea bags.<br /><br />Not so, this is the good stuff (although if you want the hassle, you can get this in loose-leaf).<br /><br />I prepare it in a Krups coffee maker (this and a few others have the correct water temperature), set a timer for 6 minutes in good water (Brita faucet filtered, which beats bottled Mountain Spring water for taste, really, and costs $0.10 per gallon).<br /><br />Don't follow my example and be led into a life-long addiction, stay away from this tea!<br /><br />:O)

review/text: We had some at home, but I don't know where it came from, but on a whim I tried it for making a quick glass of ice tea (instead of a Lipton bag).  In a rush, I made a mug of tea, let it cool a while then poured it into a big cup of ice.  I am overwhelmed at how good it was.  Not bitter at all (like the Lipton usually is) and a sort of natural sweetness (I take my ice tea unsweetened).  What a treat! I am going to get more of Barry's for my ice tea and will try it as a morning hot tea as well.

review/summary: Up Cork!
review/text: A pleasure to read the glowing reviews here for this truly fine brand of tay. On an average day stretched to include morning, noon and night I can honestly say I must drink upwards of fourteen or fifteen scalding hot mugs of Barry's Gold Blend and not a bit of a bother on me neither during the entire length of the duration. Milk and a lump of sugar too, of course, black tea being something of a Paddy Kavanagh-like penance for the homegrown likes of me. Barry's tea is blended in the fabled city of Cork, me old stomping ground as a matter of fact, having being blended meself as a fat wee babby in nearly the exact same whereabouts some two score and seven years ago. Cork incidentally is also home to The Butter Museum, a revered if not indeed wholly sacred institution whose existence is quite properly the pride of Shandon. It hardly needs repeating I suppose that Barry's tea and butter are big news in Ireland although to be honest I myself never ever tire of repeating it. Lookit now and this is no lie but there I was just the other day watching John Huston's The MacKintosh Man from 1973 and sure weren't bits of it filmed in the west of Ireland and anyway along comes this bus at one point and here's what was written in giant green letters along the full length of it: BUTTER IS THE CREAM. Begob but I froze that frame instamatically for to stand up and larf and hoot in a befitting manner. Ah memories! I heard tell of a relation of mine once, batty as a barm brack by all accounts, who on discovering he was out of milk one morning promptly dolloped a spoon of butter into his breakfast tea instead. Like I said nutty as a fruitcake but how's that for country cute, eh? Only in Eire although our Sasanach friends across the puddle do be drinking more tea than even us betimes and to prove it I'll leave yiz all with the following ditty from that very great Englishman Ray Davies, entitled appropriately enough:<br /><br />HAVE A CUPPA TEA<br /><br />Granny's always ravin' and rantin',<br />And she's always puffin' and pantin',<br />And she's always screaming and shouting,<br />And she's always brewing up tea.<br /><br />Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,<br />Cos he loves his leg of beef<br />And he washes it down with a brandy,<br />And a fresh made pot of tea.<br /><br />Chorus:<br />Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,<br />have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,<br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea<br />Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah, Rosie Lea.<br /><br />If you feel a bit under the weather,<br />If you feel a little bit peeved,<br />Take granny's stand-by potion<br />For any old cough or wheeze.<br />It's a cure for hepatitis, it's a cure for chronic insomnia,<br />It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper time,<br />You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing,<br />Tea when the weather's fine.<br />You get tea as a mid-day stimulant<br />You get tea with your afternoon tea<br />For any old ailment or disease<br />For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Whatever the situation, whatever the race or creed,<br />Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree<br />It knows no motivations, no sect or organisation,<br />It knows no one religion,<br />Nor political belief.<br /><br />Chorus<br /><br />Good that, innit? You should hear the rest of the album too that that smashing little song is on, Muswell Hillbillies, bleeding masterpiece so it is. The Kinks, wha'? Right then, I'm off to put the kettle on.

review/text: Acceptable tea, with a light gold colouring, and weighty single bags.  Despite the amount of tea per bag, the tea is not very strong, even with a long 5+min soaking. As such, it will not accept too much cream or sugar either. This is fine in itself, as the tea has a nice flavour, a blend of Assam and Kenyan teas. Its taste and strength are similar to PG Tips or more closely Typhoo.  Makes a pleasant, late evening tea, but was expecting more out of this popular Irish blend. For those preferring a much stronger, darker tea you may want to find another brand.

review/summary: I trust me Irish friends.
review/text: Having never heard of Barry's tea and learning it's an Irish tea, I decided to check it out with a friend who has visited his wife's aunts and uncles and cousins in Ireland very, very often.  Had he ever had Barry's tea?  Indeed, he had.  Every day, in fact, that he'd spent in Ireland.  And was the tea good?  Indeed, it was.  He always had some on hand back here in the states.<br /><br />And then he told me that he liked tea strong with nothing added. One of his wife's aunts didn't approve.  She gave him his cuppa and then offered him sugar and milk.  When he declined, she exclaimed, "No milk!  No sugar!  Never heard of such a thing.  Why, it's not Ash Wednesday, Lent, or Good Friday."<br /><br />I plan to buy Barry's when I find some shelf space to store it.  And, I will drink it with milk and sugar if it's not Ash Wednesday, Lent, or Good Friday.<br /><br />Amazon,  your reviewers are a hoot.

That said, my kitchen tea essentials are:  Tetley Classic, Tetley British Blend, PG Tips, and Barry's Gold Blend Tea.  Barry's may be similar to these other teas, but is definitely the very strongest of these teas.  The Irish Blend in the green box is even stronger.  Barry's is great tea in a generous 80 bag count box.

One tea bag of Barry's is much heavier and aromatic than what you are probably used to.  You can make two strong cups from a single bag.  Pickwick Finest English is my hands down favorite, but Barry's Gold Blend is a close second and a must have essential to my stock of tea.  If you are looking for a fine, heavy tea to get you started in the morning or to share a cozy Sunday morning with, give this traditional tea a try.  Barry's is a nice alternative to morning coffee.  Try it the English way with cream and sugar.

review/summary: The BEST bagged tea I've ever had
review/text: My friend brought me back a box of this stuff from Ireland. I loved it so much I actually switched from being a morning coffee drinker to a morning tea drinker (Barry's ONLY!).  Strong, but not bitter at all. Great flavor. A little milk & honey and I'm in heaven. I absolutely love it.

review/summary: Not The Same
review/text: While visiting Ireland we had the most delicious tea, Barrys Gold.<br />I ordered this tea thinking it was the same, but it is not.<br />The Barrys Gold in Ireland was a beautiful light golden color with a different taste.<br />Don't know if the word 'blend' on the box had anything to do with the difference??<br />This was a very good tea, but not what I had in Ireland. Are there different Barrys Gold teas??<br />The tea I ordered is better than what I've bought at the store so would recommend it to others.

review/summary: Lots of broken rice!
review/text: I was disappointed that Santo Tomas Paella Rice had a high percentage of broken rice pieces. Broken rice cooks faster than intact rice, so this offering of Santo Tomas Paella Rice resulted in a mushy consistency. At first Santo Tomas seems a bargain, but add in shipping costs and you'll get better for the same price. You can find alternative rice for Paella on Amazon for $2.95 (16 oz.). <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000ICLJA">C & F Arroz Valencia Short Grain Rice for Paella, 1 lb</a>. Or look at your supermarket for Arroz Valenciano or Arroz Perla from Iberia or Goya. Both offer a better quality of rice than Santo Tomas.

I paid about $7.00 for this box on sale at a local drug store chain.<br /><br />The box contains a variety of flavors and textures wrapped in milk chocolate.  The box is filled with rich caramel, hardy peanut butter, and fresh coconut cream centers.<br /><br />The variety includes roman nougat, caramel, coconut cream, raspberry caramel, strawberry cream, fruit & nut caramel, molasses chew, chocolate truffle, maple nut butter, pecan & english walnut cluster, maple nut cream, chocolate butter cream, coconut cluster, orange cream, vanilla cream, and peanut butter crunch.<br /><br />You won't be dissappointed!  If you want to make an impression with your female friends, take it from me, gift this particular variety of chocolates.

I gave it 5 stars because compared to the price at the local dollar store that average $3 per bag, so 6 bags would equal to $18, here on Amazon, it is 6 bags for only $12; so I saved an average $6 by purchasing from Amazon.  The snickers were fresh, not out-of-date, and I received order in a timely matter.  Very pleased and will order again.

review/summary: Himalayan Dark Pink Salt will keep you in the pink.
review/text: If you're looking for great value and great taste then this product is for you. I was skeptical about artisan salts and sea salts being different than regular salt until I accidentally ordered a case of sea salt from Portugal from our Co-op. Artisan salts and sea salts add flavor and zing to sea food, grilled foods and vegetables. I've never looked back and only use these special kinds of salts on everything. Be advised, though, if you put pink salt on something, it will turn that something slightly pink.<br /><br />Try this salt and then try salt from Hawaii, Portugal, France, prussian blue from Germany, salt from Japan, Mexico, etc ... You will be surprised at the diversity in taste.

The price of the product from this supplier made me suspicious of it's quality.  Happily though........it's as good as any I've found.  The packaging and shipping were both professional and I am quite pleased with the order and intend to be a repeat customer.

review/text: I really love this salt.  Not a strong taste and it doesn't overwhelm foods.  Just adds a nice, clean flavor.  Also a beautiful color.  Always a conversation starter when I put it on the table.<br /><br />Be advised that the pieces are rather large and the salt itself is "dense" rather than "crumbly" so you will need to have a good quality mill.  Our Oxo mill handles it fine, but I did try a lever-operated mill--no luck.<br /><br />Finally, the 2.2 pound bag (a kilo) costs the same as the two pound bag.  Why would anyone not buy the kilo package?

review/text: From all I have ever been able to learn, Lundberg is a first class operation.  I have tried (I think) every rice and rice blend that they offer, over the years that I have been buying their products.  While I didn't always care for a particular variety, it was never an issue of quality, just a matter of personal preference.<br /><br />There is one problem, which is not Lundberg's fault, but is worth noting.  Too often, in local grocery stores, the Lundberg product does not turn over fast enough to avoid a decline in quality.  I assume it is caused by a fermentation of the whole grain (not a problem with lesser rices because much of the "good stuff" is removed).  The symptoms are a bag which is swollen, and rice which tastes a bit like Play-Doh smells.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V64HZ2">Play-Doh 24 Pack of Colors</a>  In order to avoid this problem, I started ordering my Lundberg on-line, and storing the extra bags in my freezer or refrigerator until used.  So, buying it here (which is a little cheaper than Lundberg's on-line store) is a good way to go.  If you want to buy just one bag to try at your local grocery store, check the bag carefully, and if it tastes like Play-Doh when you get home with it, that bag was too old.<br /><br />Of all the Lundberg products, Countrywild is my absolute favorite.  It is a nice blend of flavors, and I sometimes eat a bowl of it for my entire meal.  It has a good flavor to it, but it is not as intense as some of the other varieties.<br /><br />One more thing.  For years I was frustrated with obtaining a good result when cooking whole grain rice.  I finally tried a pressure rice cooker instead of the more common non-pressure methods.  It really made a huge difference, and if you are a rice lover, you may want to try something like this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SNWJ3A">Sanyo ECJ-PX50S 5-Cup Micro-Computerized Pressure Rice Cooker and Steamer</a> or if your budget can stand it, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KVZZGW">Zojirushi NP-HTC18 Induction Heating 10-Cup Pressure Rice Cooker and Warmer</a><br /><br />(I use the Sanyo and like it pretty well.  A search on "pressure rice cooker" here, or a visit to any large Asian store, will reveal other makes and models, but there are no inexpensive pressure type rice cookers because of the substantial construction and safety requirements.)

I've made three cups at a time rather than the two-cup recipe so that my husband will have some left over for an evening treat or next day treat.  I use Tones Chicken or Beef Base along with some Orzo and Spice Classics vegetable flakes, thereby making my own Rice-A-Roni.  My cupboard is full of rice.  I also bought the 6-pack of Lundberg Wild Rice and Brown Rice Blend.  I'm not worried about expiration dates as long as the rice stays dry.  I think we will use up both boxes this year.  Good stuff.

review/summary: Good but Pricey
review/text: I bought this a few weeks ago and really like this product. This is my first time buying this product, and I find that it easy to cook (in a rice cooker!) and has a really nice chewy texture. The flavor is nutty and good too. If you like brown rice and/or wild rice, I think you will like this. The only downside for me is the price. I can buy a 20 lb (yes, that's right) bag of good white rice at an Asian market for $15.

review/text: I love to try foreign candies and this one doesn't disappoint. It brings to mind those strawberry wrapper candies with the gel in the center. I forget the name since I've never seen them in a package. Although they are colorless they are quite flavorful. After a moment you'll reach the sweet jam like center which is just as good as the outer candy. Since I was trying these for the first time I didn't want to go with a 6 pack, but since I like them it's all well and good.

review/summary: Fave dog food - Helps with allergies too!
review/text: We have a picky eater who has allergies.  A friend of our clued us in to the fact that dogs with allergies could have problems with grain in dog food.  Researched a little on the internet and turns out there's a lot of merit to that.  We selected Rachel Ray's because it had more meat than most (we just walked Wal-Mart and compared labels till we narrowed it down to two).  Our dog goes hungry before eating food she doesn't like and she gobbles this stuff up.  After 9 months we have noticed her allergies are completely cleared up as well.  Eye buggars and profuse feet licking (the vet said she's allergic to grass - really!)  So after 6 years, apparently we don't need the eye drops and the foot spray.  Just needed to change up her dog food.  Vet didn't mention that either... amazingly the guy who sells us the medicines - go figure!

My dogs seem to do well with Nutrish and are actually eating when I feed them.  Nice to watch after eight years of turning up their noses.

review/summary: Better than its low price suggests
review/text: My four year old Beagle's coat has improved by switching from Pedigree to Rachael Ray. His stool is much firmer now which should help reduce discomfort from impacted anal glands (I also give him ground organic flax seed as a supplement).<br /><br />By comparison, the primary ingredient in Pedigree is corn. With Rachael Ray, the primary ingredients are chicken and rice. It still contains some corn and animal fat but its further down on the list of ingredients. You can tell the difference in quality when you first open the bag -- it smells like proper food. Cheap dog foods tend to stink up the room.<br /><br />I even sampled a few kibbles for myself and found them to be reasonably tasty, like a snack food.<br /><br />I gave it four stars rather than five because it contains cheaper filler grains like corn meal and brewers rice. Among low-cost dog foods, this is arguably the best available option.

review/summary: Olde English Bulldogge Loves It
review/text: We recently rescued a 6 yr old Olde English Bulldogge and was given Kibbles N Bits by the previous owners. All they stated was that we should try to find a dog food that has some sort of meat as the first ingredients because these dogs tend to pass gas alot when they have alot of grain. We moved to Pierre, SD right after we got the dog and seriously, there is only a Walmart here where I can buy dog food. There might be one other place, but I'd have to go hunt. I searched and searched Walmart for a brand of dog food that has meat as its first ingredient and finally found Nutrish. The dog likes the Beef kind, but because of her corn row teeth in the front, we water it down, and she lets it soak for a good 30 min. and then she gobbles it up like there is no tomorrow. The price is good for the value. But I am buying here on Amazon because it is slightly cheaper.

review/summary: Horrible experience
review/text: When I was on a trip earlier this week my wife bought this food for our dogs from Walmart.  She didn't have access to a car and we had run out of our typical brand.  BIG MISTAKE!  Our 1 1/2 year old shepherd mix had a significant allergic reaction, presumably to either the cornmeal or soy additives (neither of which is in our other dog food).  After a day or two on the food he began to rub his face and head constantly on the floor.  By the third day we knew something was terribly wrong as his face began to look like a furry prune and his one eye looked like he had been punched or stung.  By the following morning the rest of his body had taken on the prickly character of hives.  He got some much needed relief from the vet in the form of some steroid shots and is now much better.<br /><br />Obviously it is never good to swap foods.  What's disappointing is that Ms. Ray would attach her name to something so obviously inferior. I see there is an option for a video review. if I had know that I would have documented my dog's poor appearance yesterday--maybe I could have gotten a refund on this "crap" that passes for "food" or at least some assistance with my sizable vet bill.<br /><br />Although this size of the food gets a respectable ranking I see that other sizes of the same stuff get reamed for their allergy-causing fillers.  I would say buyer beware, especially if you even suspect your dog is prone to food allergies.

It is easy to eat two at a time but with so much white flour and sugar they can add weight to you and raise blood sugar levels.<br />I recommend only eating on occasion and as a small treat or dessert in order to curb a sweet tooth.  It is not a good choice for a breakfast item.

review/summary: Lots of Sugar!
review/text: I saw this product in a local health foods store and had to buy it. I used to like "Pop Tarts" a long time ago, but have not been able to eat them because of all the artificial colors and flavors they contain. This organic version tastes great! And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic `pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol. I urge people to not eat such products that have so much sugar in them, because eating them will tax your pancreas and make you overweight. Please look for a more salubrious breakfast item.

For what they are, I suppose they are good, especially considering the healthy/organic angle.  However, honestly, I wouldn't bother purchasing these again.  They are a hard, piecrust-like wrap encasing a very thin smear of jam, with another very thin smear of "frosting" on the outside.  The flavor honestly is pretty much "sweet cardboard".  Just not really worth eating, in my opinion.  A piece of toast with jam is more appealing.

review/summary: A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.

It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.

review/text: Although my kids prefer Pop Tarts, this is a healthy alternative. Believe it or not, the Apple without the frosting is pretty decent. There is cinnamon on the top of it which adds a bit of spice...I don't really like too much frosting on mine. The cherry pomengrante is the most preferred in my home. They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much...

review/summary: Delicious toaster pastries...
review/text: All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)

review/summary: Incredible
review/text: These pastries are one of the most delicious I have ever eaten! The strawberry taste is incredible and the final appearance is excellent. It is appropriate for guests and private parties. The amount is quite a lot and you may indulge for a long time especially because it is organic and healthy. I am very, very pleased with this purchase.

review/summary: Kids Love 'Em!!
review/text: The kids love 'em and what could be better than that?  I bought one box at the local grocery and glad to see they are available here.  We tried the strawberry, frosted, and like other reviewers I agree:  not too sweet, right amount of frosting.  Can't wait to try the next flavor.

review/summary: Tasty
review/text: I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me.

review/summary: These are good pastries
review/text: I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes.

review/summary: Great alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: These are very good breakfast and snacks!  The only downside is they are pretty hard just cold.  So pop them in the toaster and makes a world of differance!

review/summary: Tastes great!
review/text: I have always been pretty picky about my poptarts, so I wasn't sure if these were going to taste like cardboard or not when I first got them.  They are great poptarts.  My kids love them.
