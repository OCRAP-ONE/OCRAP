review/summary: My kitty was sick after eating only ONE of these...
review/text: I bought these thinking they would be a slightly more productive treat for my 6yo, small, male cat. Usually I give him little pieces of plain fish or chicken, but was happy that there was something that might lessen how often I brush his teeth (since he hates it with a furry passion!).<br /><br />I gave him one thinking if he liked it I would give him more, but didn't want to confuse his system. After about 3 minutes, he threw up everywhere. More than once. I didn't want him to be sick, but he was so excited and had gobbled it up so fast I thought I would try the other flavor. Same thing after only one greenie. He's an EXTREMELY healthy cat, very active and has never had a single health problem, but these made him so sick. After he threw up he wouldn't eat for two days. I was going to take him to the vet, but he perked back up, and started eating normally (hasn't thrown up once since).<br /><br />Obviously it's not like this for every cat, but I looked into it further and if you read reviews from other major sellers there are many problems like this in perfectly healthy cats. Some reacted even worse than mine, so I was lucky.

review/summary: Lil'Goat loves em
review/text: My lil goat who was born a cat and eats grass fell in love with Greenies. None of my previous cats would touch them, so I bought them as an experiment when we were waiting for the next patch of oat grass seeds to sprout. He's so pleased with these that the organic Temptations Tuna nibbles have taken a back seat for now.<br /><br />This roly poly musclely cat-goat wakes up and waits very patiently for me to bring him his morning menu of:<br /><br />Grass sprouts<br />Pet Ease Paw Gel (stress & anxiety)-He licks it from the tube<br />and a couple of either tuna treats or Greenies<br /><br />A few minutes of patting his tummy and scratching him and his day begins...

review/summary: Great ....A Staple Treat For My Cat
review/text: I have been buying Greenies in various varieties for well over a year now.  They are one of two regular treats I give my cat on occasion, (the other being Whiskas Temptations, also available on Amazon).  These Greenies are a little bigger than Whiskas, but are easily broken up and chewed throughly by my 18 year old cat.  Although she doesn't seem to go genuinely crazy for any one flavor over another, I would have to say that the tuna, seafood varieties seem to be a favorite.  She never seems to tire of them, and they are good for her teeth.  Although the Whiskas are found locally quite easily in Walmarts and super markets, these Greenies only seem to be available here at either expensive pet stores, or at the local Tractor Supply Co. at a much more reasonable price.  If you don't live anywhere near a Tractor Supply store, the price on them here on Amazon is excellent with the free shipping thrown in.  (Just make sure you either bundle them or better yet, buy enough of them at once to get them shipped free).  My cat loves these treats and they are good for her teeth.  I occasionally give these out to neighbor cats that are passing by and have never found a cat yet that doesn't love them....Highly recommended...

review/summary: Fantastic Treats
review/text: There are only a few treats that are enjoyed by both my cats, Feline Greenies are one of them. One cat is very finicky and won't eat most treats, but then again, that is the nature of cats. They get a few as a treat and they LOVE them. They have an added benefit that they are good for their teeth, though it is not a replacement for teeth cleaning. For those that don't know, teeth cleaning is quite important for cats!<br /><br />These treats have several flavors and they are low in calories, so they are a good treat in my book. 5 stars for being an excellent product.

review/summary: A very picky cat's favorite treat!
review/text: My cat is VERY picky about what she will eat.  These are the only treats that gets her RUNNING.  Plus I love the fact that these are supposed to be good for her teeth too.  My dog also loves these treats but she'll only get one when I feel bad that she's doing tricks in front of me to get one while I'm treating the cat.<br /><br />I've tried a bunch of other cat treats with no success (turns up her nose at every one of them).  I bought the freeze-dried chicken treats and I thought I had another winner but after happily gulping up 4 or 5 over the course of a couple days my cat has had enough and now turns up her nose to them.  Not her greenies though, I've bought her the salmon, the chicken and the tuna and she loves all of them.  I've been giving her greenies for a couple of month now and she has yet to get sick of them, she's always jumping up begging for greenies and I have to hide the bags from her or it will be torn up and covered with teeth marks.<br /><br />Give these a try!  They're my cat's favorite!

review/summary: Great Feline Taste!
review/text: This is my favorite flavor greenie so far.  You can really taste the tuna, but it doesn't overpower the distinctive feline flavor.  I admit I was skeptical of these "soylent greenies" and wondered if they could really capture the great kitty taste in such small bite size morsels, but I could eat these all day long.  The best thing is that these are also good for your teeth!  My dentist was very impressed.

review/summary: Must Have Seasoning for Your Kitchen
review/text: I first tried Vegeta after hearing about it while visiting Eastern Europe in the late 90's.  It has since become a kitchen staple.  I use Vegeta when making soups, stews, Chicken or Veal Marsala or Piccata.  Vegeta can be used to season rice or pasta.  Since it is made from vegetables, I have used it to enrich the flavor of vegetarian Thanksgiving 'stuffing'.  Vegeta can also be used to enhance sauces and gravies.  If you haven't tried Vegeta, I urge you to do so.  I believe that it is widely used across Europe.

review/summary: Vegeta is ++Awesome
review/text: I use Vegeta all the time.  My local source for it closed (!), so I started buying it at Amazon.  A little goes a long way, and it really does make just about anything with a sauce or that is "wet" taste better.  I use it in place of salt.  You will have friends and family wondering how the simple things are so tasty!<br /><br />Note: it contains MSG.  I say this only to poke fun at people who are concerned about it; every time I mention Vegeta, anyone who knows what it is says, "Did you know it has MSG in it?"  Seriously folks, pay attention to Real Live Science.  The studies that have purported to show a link between it and some kind of allergic reaction or sensitivity have all been debunked.  Real scientific studies show no correlation.<br /><br />Oh, and most of your savory foods you love (including broccoli, cooked meats, soy sauce, Worcestershire, tomatoes, parmesan cheese) have naturally-occurring glutamates, including MSG.  If you eat any of these things and don't experience the "chinese food syndrome", realize any MSG sensitivity is all just the power of suggestion.  So stop being influenced by pop culture and enjoy!<br /><br />[...]

I add some of this to broth to boost the flavor when I make soups, rice, and cous-cous.  I like the vegetable flavor, it's much better than other vegetable boullions I've tried, and it's convenient to use.  I, too, wish it did not have msg, but you don't need to use much, so for me the amount of msg is tolerable.

review/summary: The 'missing' ingredient
review/text: In my younger days, I tried a dozen times to make authentic Cevapcici (pronounced: Che-VAP-chi-chi) and never succeeded until I learned that the 'best' recipes used this vegetable stock powder, 'Vegeta', as well as a fair bit of WHITE pepper, as important flavouring ingredients. I had 'Vegeta' in my pantry, but didn't have the good sense to add it to my failed attempts. [The name 'Cevapcici' is southern Slavic and is related to the word "kebab" which means, in simplest terms, a dish made from meat--but to most of the people who prepare and eat this dish, especially nowadays, it also implies generally that the meat is grilled.] Cevapcici are small, skinless sausages, usually made from a mixture of different minced meats. Mine are 75% pork and 25% beef, but there are 40-50 popular recipes out there, to cater to local customs and dietary observances.<br /><br />'Vegeta' is a multi-purpose seasoning made from dehydrated vegetables with a bit of sugar, salt, riboflavin, herbs and spices, plus MSG. It makes an excellent vegetable stock, which may be enriched with whatever meat, poultry or seafood that you might want to use for soups, sauces or gravy. It's also a very good addition to any stews, soups, pot roasts, meat pies and casseroles.<br /><br />The manufacturers suggest adding it to 'liquid' dishes about 5 minutes before the end of cooking. However, it may be added directly to meat dishes such as meatballs, stuffed cabbage, rissoles, hamburgers, stuffed peppers and so on. It works really well in almost every European, American or Asian cuisine, particularly in dishes where marinating or mixing meats, the day before cooking, is involved. 'Vegeta' could be just the 'magic touch' that everyone who makes their own sausages has been looking for. 'Vegeta' is not that well-known among my acquaintances, even the ones who do a lot of cooking. However it is, along with 'cajun seasoning', among my "special, secret ingredients"--or at least it WAS, until I wrote this review...<br /><br />Caveats: Recipes that demand 'Vegeta' usually don't specify any extra salt, as the 'Vegeta' is (usually) salty enough. The ingredients are all vegetarian and vegan friendly (as far as I can tell) but the manufacturers do not make a point of mentioning this on the package or accompanying recipes/literature. [Riboflavin? There are many sources...just so you know!]<br /><br />Happy cooking!

review/summary: Excellent Source of Protein for Snacking
review/text: As a Certified Personal Trainer, I am always looking for products to recommend to my clients.  Of course, I would never recommend anything that I have not tried for myself FIRST.  Free range turkey jerky is an excellent choice for snacking, and Shelton's is by far the BEST TASTING! The flavor is not too spicy, but certainly not bland either.  The jerky's texture is very chewable, not leather-like.  Even my elderly clients can chew it. Being turkey, not beef, it saves you calories and fat.  It is a great source of (antibiotic-free) protein that does not make you feel bloated, so it perfect for snacking.  No need to worry about refrigeration after opening, so you can carry it in your gym bag and have the perfect post-workout protein snack.  I also recommend my clients keep it at work so they can avoid being tempted by the vending machines.  Amazon has it at a GREAT price!!

review/text: I have been buying this turkey jerky for several years.  Love it!! Because it is turkey, it contains less fat than traditional beef jerky. Do not be fooled into thinking that because it it turkey is is without flavor!!  This peppered jerky will satisfy your craving with a kick of spice.  It is not sweet or barbecue flavored, just great peppered turkey taste.  The 12, one ounce packages are perfect for the gym bag as an after workout snack, or take them to work and eat them instead of something nasty out of the vending machine! You will not be disappointed.

review/summary: Thinest stale turkey jerky.
review/text: I have never had worst product.  It was extremely hard and tasteless.  I can't believe that I paid so much for it.  I gave it two stars instead of one so people will read this review.  Of course I couldn't return it because they call it food.  The package picture misrepresents the product.  Very little brown turkey,  I would never buy it at a store.  I will read the negative reviews first from now on, which were the truth, not the over abundance of five star.  I was going to say that I will never order food products again from Amazon but I have bought very good Stevia Chocolate before.

review/summary: Best natural jerkey
review/text: I tried this when I was in Southern California and cannot find it anywhere in northern California.  I like it because it is poultry and has natural ingredients with no preservatives.  I can eat it instead of a protein bar, I can take it camping, it doubles as "emergency earthquake supplies".  AND it's not full of fat or sugar.  I find the price a little high, but i make sure to have the bag last for several days.

review/summary: Terrible low quality pressed bits in tiny bags
review/text: This turkey jerky is really bad quality jerky. It comes as a bunch of tiny extremely thin pressed bits in tiny bags. The little pieces are dry, bad tasting and look like they are reconstituted without any texture to them at all. I have been getting jerky from a place called Mountain America Jerky which recently raised their prices and so I am trying Amazon.com merchants. This jerky is really really bad. The other Amazon.com merchant I have tried for turkey jerky is Golden Valley which is much much better than this jerky. Don't get this stuff at all. It is really bad. Try the Golden Valley jerky also here at amazon. That at least has some decent flavor and you can tell it once was a turkey! This stuff is just awful.

It's pretty much the only dry food that we give our senior German Shepherd.

review/summary: Amazing for our favorite !
review/text: We recently took in our friends dog due to a relocation issue. Boomer just turned 12 and we love him to pieces! Unfortunately, with all larger dogs, his hips have begun to fail him and with our wooden floors and stairs throughout the home, he was really struggling to get around without his hind legs giving out on him mid-walk. As fall is kicking in and the weather is damp and cold (we live in upstate NY) I was fearful of his hips just progressively getting worse over the winter. So we changed his food to Natural's Senior Dog food and not only does he love it, but it has been great on his digestive track and for his hips!! We are so happy to see the puppy in him again! He is such a lover and so incredibly happy now that he is no longer in the pain he was in. We are very impressed with this product, I just wish we could continue to find it at our local pet store- it seems like they are no longer carrying this product in stores and we truly hope we can find it for decent prices later in the future.

He is able to get up and down better, his mental attitude is remarkable. He went from sleeping most of the day, to being how active he was five years ago.

review/text: Chewy, nutty, crispy, soft and forgiving with little crisps (amaranth?) and big nut chunks (whole nuts in some bites!) - a perfect textural balance. And I simply adore the addictive all natural taste of these bars! They're sweetened with what I consider to be the perfect blend of honey and dates. A little more sugar than I like to have for breakfast (11g), but not bad compared to other bars and good for an afternoon treat. My husband and I can polish these off in seconds!

review/text: I was looking more for Ten Ren's Chrysanthemum tea flavor. This is VERY light in flavor and lacking any strong chrysanthemum taste. Over all the tea was pleasing, a smooth drink that would go well with a meal.<br />**Edit - the more I drink this tea the more I like it. The smell of it is a little odd but the taste is very smooth and it feels very cleansing. You can steep for as long as you like and it will not get bitter. Brews a very deep dark brown but the taste is extremely light.

review/text: There is simply no comparison between Nellie & Joe's and other lime juices available in stores or even most fresh lime juice.<br /><br />Great addition to BBQ marinades and dressings.  However, my favorite use is in a margarita - add 50 % - 80% lime juice to tequila and Contreau to taste, on the rocks and do not shake. Use with care.  Much less sugar than the traditional margarita and may be a little sour for some; but, it quickly becomes an acquired taste.<br /><br />The Nellie and Joes site has lots of recipes for sauces, marinades and such.<br /><br />Note that the Amazon vendor appears to have the prices switched on the products.

review/summary: several reviews are obviously confused...
review/text: The name of the fruit, key lime, simply designates a specific type of lime. There are 2 types of limes commonly available in the US. Persian limes, which are the "standard" larger types of limes that you find in most grocery stores and key limes, which are much smaller, generally very round, and often have a lighter skin color. Because of the smaller size, key limes require a larger number of to yield much juice. While they are often recognized as being grown in florida, key limes are also grown in texas as well as california. You can certainly juice your own key limes in order to make a fantastic key lime pie, but having the pre made product available here definitely save time and effort. I make 20-30 key lime pies every year. I have tried using both fresh limes and this bottled lime juice. There is ultimately no significant difference between the 2.

review/text: We buy a bottle of this monthly. I urge anyone who keeps bottles longer to try it other recipes.<br />We use it for limeade, baking, in whipped frostings for vanilla cakes, and my family's favorite use of it is when I make honey lime chicken. I'll bake or saut&eacute; a couple chicken breasts with onions, garlic, salt, pepper and parsley until almost done, then cover them in a honey-lime juice mix using this lime juice and a local produced honey and finish cooking the chicken. The excess juice gets spooned over vegetables, and everyone in my family really loves it when I make chicken this way.<br />Very recommended. It has a bright, clean lime taste, and adds a wonderful flavor to punches, limeade, shrimp, chicken and works wonderfully in salad dressings.

Both pies were gone before other desserts were even touched.  I tried this product one winter in New England when fresh key limes were simply not available (for less than $50 special order)- so to have found this was a pleasant surprise.  Make the recipe on the bottle- use a pre-made graham cracker crust if you must or make your own, which is so much better and easy enough to do, then top with homemade whipped cream.  People will LOVE it!  I live in California now and can easily get key limes but still use Nellie and Joes for pies because it's so easy.  Enjoy!

review/summary: Boring
review/text: My husband and I visit the Florida Keys quite often. We always make sure that we treat ourselves to some wonderful Key Lime Pie. In the past we have always brought home fresh Key lime fruit from some market in Key West. Due to flight regulations and restrictions, we were unable to bring it home this past December. So I decided to purchase some online and this is how we found this brand and used it. It was a real disappointment.The juice tasted like any ordinary lemon juice and lacked that floral bitter tang that Key Limes are famous for.I don't know how this brand can call themselves the famous and original.The juice is from concentrate and who knows what kind of process it went through but it definitely lacked freshness and I will never buy it again.

review/summary: I don't use anything else
review/text: I've been a full service restaurant cook for the past 10 years. Ever since I discovered this rub, I have not used anything else for my steaks at home. I coat both sides with a very thin layer of vegetable oil (which helps the flavor of the rub soak into the meat), then coat both sides with a very generous and EVEN layer of rub. Once you've done that, take the meat and thoroughly rub it in. Fire up the ol' charcoal grill, throw 'em on, and a couple minutes later, you have the finest top sirloin steaks that money can buy. The steak has so much flavor that it would be insulted if you ate it with steak sauce. I'm not kidding.

review/summary: Don't Eat Steak Without It
review/text: Emeril's Steak Rub is an excellent product. I love the way it makes steaks taste and I would be very disappointed if I had to broil a steak without first seasoning it with Emeril's Steak Rub.<br /><br />I can't figure out why this product isn't available in stores. The way I learned about the product is when I bought my brother a cute little steak kit. I bought the set for him and decided to buy one for me. I was hooked. But when I went to the store to buy more of the steak rub, I couldn't find it. Anywhere. I searched in different supermarkets, gourmet shops, kitchen stores, all to no avail.<br /><br />Finally it occurred to me that I should look for the product online. And when I found it -- where else, but on Amazon -- I bought it in bulk; i.e., a six pack. I just bought my second six pack.<br /><br />Delicious!

My dogs love taking them out into the yard and playing with them in the dirt.  Good bones and good for chewing.  As with all toys like this, please watch your dog carefully and make sure they don't eat the bone, just play with it and chew it.

review/summary: Great product, but our dogs are bored
review/text: I'd give this a 5, but the dogs would rate it a 3. They like other Nylabone shapes better, and this one is their last choice out of the toy box. Now that it has been worn down to about 1/3 it's starting size over one year it is time to throw it out. It has been replaced by shapes that our dogs find more fun. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ASMT4">Nylabone Dura Chew Ring Dog Chew Toy, Original Flavor, Giant</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010P0YSW">Nylabone Dura Chew Wishbone Chew Toy, Original Flavor, Wolf</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00201JENG">Nylabone Dura Chew Bone, Original Flavor, Souper</a>.<br /><br />The natural colored Nylabones have been great products for our dogs. They really do clean teeth. I wish I had before and after pictures of our jack russell. When we adopted him at 4 years old he had the worst breath and his rear teeth were literally green with buildup. Now he just has normal doggie breath and his teeth are super clean (no buildup). This was the bone he used most (because it was the smallest in the house) and helped him learn that chewing is a fun doggie thing to do.

review/summary: Original is the best flavor - according to my dogs :)
review/text: Not all dogs love nylabones, but two out of three of my dogs enjoy them on a regular basis. They have tried every flavor because I spoil them to death, but they seem to love the original one the best. I found a brownish/pink flavor once (I can't remember the flavor, I think it was pork) and they also loved that one, but I haven't seen that flavor in stores lately.<br /><br />Although these products are relatively safe, no chew is 100% safe. I'd watch any dogs that are just getting accustomed to these so you can get an idea as to how safe they are. One of my dogs broke his back tooth on the Galileo bone and the vet had to pull it. The way he angled his jaw on that particular product (it's very thick) was unsafe. It was TOO hard and a little too big for him. But I watch him with these and it is a good match. You can literally see all the tension just leave his body as he gets a good chew going.<br /><br />My only other advice is this: avoid stepping on them while barefoot. You'll see what I mean.

review/summary: My dog loves it, but it makes me nervous
review/text: I have an Australian Cattle Dog mix who is a year and a half old and a very heavy chewer.  She DESTROYS most toys.  I found this bone on sale at Target and decided to give it a try.  She had the Nylabone puppy key teether and enjoyed those.  I was surprised how hard this bone is - like a rock - but she LOVES LOVES LOVES it!  It sounds awful while she chews it and I constantly worry that she's going to crack or break a tooth while chewing.  I know it's supposed to help clean their teeth and gums, but I noticed that it ripped up the roof of her mouth pretty bad after a long chewing session - to the point where parts of the ridges on the top of her mouth were completely gone.<br /><br />I might try to see if I can find slightly softer bones of this nature for her to chew on - just for my own sanity.  I'd hate to think she could damage her mouth or ruin her teeth on this toy.  She gives this bone 5 stars, I give it 3 - so we're averaging a 4.

review/summary: Broke my dog's tooth; will not buy again
review/text: My adult German Shepherd destroys things quickly as all GSD like to do. My vet recommended the Nylabone as it was supposed to be good for her teeth, so I got one, but it ended up chipping off about half of one of her little front teeth. In addition, once some chewing has occurred, the bone gets a lot of hard, sharp jagged edges that can cut both the dog's gums and my hands.<br /><br />It is definitely durable and my dog loved to chew on it, but I'd rather spend more money and have her go through a bunch of softer chew toys than to find more broken teeth. Also worth noting is that a different reviewer also mentioned a broken tooth.

review/text: I have a very active and sweet Border Collie mix who loves chasing and chewing. I try hard to match his energy level, and for the most part succeed, but there are times when I just can't. This Nylabone is perfect for keeping him busy during those times when I can't be playing fetch or chasing him around the house or yard. My only slight concern is whether a hard chewer can crack or break their teeth, or damage their gums during excessively hard and long chewing sessions. Excellent product.

review/text: I have a 70 lb chow/terrier mix who loves to chew and loves toys. I recently got him a bone at a pet store and he loved it, so I figured that the Nylabone souper would be a hit. Well, it arrived today, and he does enjoy it, but maybe a little too much. In the span of a few hours, he's managed to get an entire chunk off the smaller end. He made about as much progress on the natural bone in this time, and it was a cheaper. I think I'll probably just stick with the natural bones from now on.  As a side note, I had a dachshund before this pup. I bought the dachshund the Nylabone variety pack and he destroyed them all pretty quickly as well. Maybe I have just been blessed with ultra-aggressive chewers?
