review/summary: Pretty Much Like The Regular
review/text: I like this product. It has a slightly fruity tinge to it but I did not find it overpowering.<br /><br />These packets feel more stiff because they are foil-lined instead of the standard paper packet that you find in restaurants.<br /><br />Splenda is my favorite sweetener. I tried this in some cappuccino and it did seem like I had to put more in to get the same taste that I get with regular Splenda.<br /><br />I can't offer too much more. Though this was a good product, there was not enough difference for me to write an essay worth.

review/summary: Tastes exactly the same in coffee
review/text: We use Splenda all the time in our morning cofffee. The Splenda with antioxidents tastes exactly the same to us, so that's not an issue at all.  The thing that concerns me with this product is that when I looked online to see what they say about what happens to the vitamins when heated, it says they do diminish some.  They say it's no more than what happens when you cook your vegetables, though. So, the only thing I'd consider if you plan on using this for coffee is if it's worth the price compared to regular Splenda.  If you are paying about the same - no problem.  But if you pay more for just the vitamins and if they are going to diminish - is it worth it?

review/summary: Good sugar substitute
review/text: Putting aside the debate as to whether or not splenda is good for you, we like this product.<br /><br />My wife and I are trying to reduce the amount of sugar in our diet (we're in our late 20's early 30's) because of health issues that run in our families. The problem is that the artificial sweeteners we've tried have all left a bad taste in our mouth (pun intended). This is the first time we've tried splenda, in spite of having been on the market for awhile, and quite honestly we were both shocked. It's sweeter than table sugar, so you don't use as much, and it doesn't have the strange aftertaste that is usually a hallmark of artificial sweeteners.<br /><br />We have not tried cooking with it yet, but for tea, fruit, cereal and general use it is really quite good.

review/summary: Different from regular Splenda
review/text: I am a regular Splenda user so I was eager to try Splenda Essentials with antioxidants. Perhaps this product works better in baking. It curdled in my coffee and was really too sweet, at least for my taste. I had two other people try it and it curdled their drinks as well. All reported it as overly sweet.

review/summary: Splenda is my favorite sweetener
review/text: I'm a hot tree drinker, no coffee.  I've tried most of the artifical sweeteners on the market.  Sweet N Low had a nasty after taste, Equal did too, but not as bad.  Eventually though, I had adapted my taste buds to both.  When Splenda first hit the market, I was skeptical, but quickly fell in love.  I didn't experience the after tastes like on the other sweeteners.  I switched over to the Splenda with Fiber, but was NOT a fan of the foil lined packets.  They're tougher to open and a pain in the neck to keep smacking/flicking them to get the product to the bottom so the packet can be ripped open.  This can be frustrating, and it's not an easy task.  I didn't notice any taste difference between the fiber or this antioxidant, but being that I'm a tea drinker, I might not notice any supposed fruity taste that someone else experienced.  These have the same foil lined packets, but for some reason, I found these even harder (than the Fiber packets) to flick down the sugar to the bottom of the packet.<br />5 stars for taste, 3 stars for the foil lined packets, 4 stars overall.

review/summary: Great Idea, Improved Packaging
review/text: Some products really catch my attention, and this is one of them. Antioxidants are nice but that's not the coolest part.<br /><br />The sweetener is more concentrated than the stuff you buy in the bag, and like its yellow package brother, a very nice alternative to sugar.<br /><br />The packaging is what I really like. The thicker foil packaging is great. It is vacuum sealed and water `resistant'. For camping, and other activities where you need to toss a couple packs in your bag, this is the ticket. I don't have to worry about them tearing open or getting soggy.<br /><br />The flavor is terrific and about the same as the regular stuff. I tried mixing them both in a cup of water for comparison. I couldn't tell any difference.<br /><br />What I like best about Splenda is that it does not give you the sugar-shock that high-fructose-corn-syrup gives me. No calories, great taste, antioxidants, works with any diet, and very portable.<br /><br />Buy this.

review/summary: Sweet Addition
review/text: Before trying this new sweetener in iced tea, I taste tested the Splenda right out of the packet. Aside from a very slight (and not unpleasant) citrus tang, it tastes just like regular Splenda. Since I drink so much tea and other sugar free drinks, this antioxidant enriched formula works well for me. It's an easy way to sneak more vitamin C into my diet. Each packet has the equivalent of 20% of the daily recommended amount.<br /><br />On a side note, the sweetener in these packets seems slightly more intense, so I find I don't have to use as many packets as I normally do, which adds value for me.

review/summary: Buy regular Spenda and take a vitamin and save yourself 300%
review/text: The trend of blending packaged foods with medicine is one of the driving forces in consumer products.  This product and its cousins are no exception.<br /><br />First off, the product tastes just like Spenda to me in my Iced Tea.  It is good to know that I might be getting some nutrition with my sweetener, then I looked at the economics of it.  Nutritionally enhanced Spenda costs ($0.09/packet) about three times more than regular Splenda ($0.03/packet).  Now that may not seem like much but if you put two packets in your coffee that is 12 cents a cup.  Many of us have multiple drinks in a day, adding to your routine. No so much to make you think twice as you get 'more' with Spenda Essentials, but it adds up and you may want to think again.<br /><br />I am a little concerned that the addition of the antioxidants requires putting the Spenda in a foil packet rather than the simple paper cover for regular Spenda.  The packaging kept reminding me that I was getting chemistry along with my sweetener.<br /><br />I am not saying that you should avoid this product and its better getting some vitamins rather than none.  But it seems to me that a more effective approach would be to use regular Spenda and take a multivitamin.  Not only is it less expensive, but the vitamin provides a broader range of nutrients than what is found in this product.<br /><br />So as a product, its great, tastes like regular Spenda, delivers antioxidants and mixes well in my drinks.  Economically, I think that you have a better alternative that is cheaper, better nutritionally and still gives you all of Spenda's taste.

review/summary: Try a teaspoon of Truvia and a vitamin for far less money.
review/text: I used to use Splenda a lot, from some packages to large bags.  I've gone over to Truvia for the taste, maybe a personal preference, but I'm allowed that.  What I really can't see is how adding a little vitamin E and C to the mix results in almost twice the price as the regular product, and far far more than just buying bulk product and popping a vitamin a day, which will also give you 100+% of your daily antioxidant recommendation as opposed to 5 packets of this.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm not falling for it.

That will be of definite benefit to my multiple personal health issues.

review/summary: Vitamins have a taste
review/text: OK, I consume a lot of Splenda every day.  I eat some in my morning Oatmeal, and I always make it a point to get the Diet Coke with Splenda in it, rather than the aspartame stuff.<br /><br />I have been getting the fiber splenda.  One gram of fiber per packet didn't seem to be much, but it was something to make the sweetener less empty, and it eliminated the gram of dextrose used to stretch the Splenda to make it measure. You occasionally see the tablets of Splenda, but they are rare, and they don't work on oatmeal.<br /><br />So I asked my wife, "Please surprise me by switching to the Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants some morning over the next week."  She agreed. On the third morning, I noted an odd taste in my cereal.  Not unpleasant, just odd.<br /><br />I asked her, and she confirmed, that was the first morning she had used the Antioxidant Splenda.<br /><br />So, unlike the fiber splenda, the antioxidant Splenda has a taste.<br /><br />Now, I normally only put sweetener in my coffee if it is nasty tasting.  But I don't have any nasty tasting coffee, so I put the antioxidant Splenda sweetener into regular coffee just to see if I can taste it.<br /><br />I am pretty sure I can taste it, but it is not a blind taste test.  I am going by what I taste in my oatmeal.<br /><br />As I've said, the taste is minor and not unpleasant.  It is hard to detect when I put one packet into 8 ounces of coffee.<br /><br />My opinion is that Splenda is the best artificial sweetener on the market.  The worst tasting is aspartame, then stevia because of the odd licorice overtone. Then saccharine, and that only when a small amount of saccarine is used.  I used to make ice tea with a half gallon of strong tea and one saccharine, and at that ratio, it was not bad.  It took the bitter edge off of the tea.<br /><br />If you can get cyclamates, they go here, and then, at the top, Splenda. Nothing tastes like sugar, especially not corn syrup, but splenda has the most neutral sweet taste of the artificials.  Now that it is available, I try not to use any of the other artificials, and I am not supposed to consume a lot of sugar.<br /><br />So plain splenda would get five stars as an artificial sweetener.  Essentials with fiber would get the same score. Antioxidant gets 4 stars because it has an off taste that is not a bad taste and because it is detectable other than sweetener. I believe that even with this off taste it tastes better than saccharine.  So it loses one star for the detectable taste, but not more.<br /><br />This sweetener comes in a heavy, stiff, hard to tear bag, that could probably survive being kept in a wallet in the rain without damage, and the bag is stiff and strong enough that someone with bad arthritis might not want or be able to use the sweetener in the bag.

review/summary: Tastes the SAME as regular SPLENDA, just BETTER for you ...
review/text: I am a HUGE FAN of Splenda.  I have been using it for years.  Many years ago, I used to ONLY use sugar (and a lot of it).  I have a real sweet tooth.  Anyway, I tried the pink and blue packet artificial sweeteners and did not like the weird after taste they left.  Once I tried Splenda, I was hooked.  I gradually weaned myself off of sugar and only use Splenda (and Jay Robb spoonable granulated Stevia).  I REALLY like Splenda to sweeten my tea and oatmeal.<br /><br />When I saw the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (basically Splenda with a BONUS, something good for you ... fiber, antioxidents or B vitamins), I decided to try ALL of them.  I really like the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS.  They all taste the same to me ... the same as regular SPLENDA.  The ONLY difference I noticed is the packaging.  It is not that THIN, yellow packaging.  It is a thicker (almost like a wet-n-dri wipe) package.  Other than that, I wouldn't have even noticed a difference.  I now use all three of the different SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (fiber, B vitamins and Antioxidents) to sweeten my tea so I can get the nutritional benefits of all three.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants
review/text: This new, enhanced Splenda has 0 calories per packet and provides 20% of the recommended daily intake of vitamins C and E (based on a 2,000 calorie diet).<br /><br />I have been using regular Splenda (both loose and in packets) for several years.  I don't notice any aftertaste (unlike the lingering taste of Sweet-n-Low which I can't stomach).<br /><br />I did taste tests with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, 400-Count Packets</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257C">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with Antioxidants, .41-Pounds (Pack of 4)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257M">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins, .41-Pounds (Pack of 4)</a>.  I tried all three with berries, tea and Greek yogurt.  I could not distinguish the difference between the three as far as taste or level of sweetness. They all dissolved easily in hot tea and mixed into the yogurt without any graininess.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the packaging for Splenda with Antioxidants and Splenda with B vitamins is different than the regular Splenda packets.  The enhanced Splenda products come in foil-lined packets while the regular Splenda comes in paper packets (similar to Equal and Sweet-n-Low).<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen information on the box about any potential side effects of consuming too much vitamin C and/or E per day. I suggest speaking with a doctor about whether vitamins C and E interact with any medication you may take and whether there are any concerns with taking too much on a daily basis.<br /><br />I drink at least 10 cups of tea per day and am not comfortable taking 200% of the recommended daily intake of vitamins C and E (especially since I also take a multivitamin daily).  I plan to rely mainly on the regular, non-enhanced Splenda (especially since it is significantly less expensive than either of the enhanced versions).<br /><br />*This is very similar to my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004OQ257M">Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins, .41-Pounds (Pack of 4)</a> as I tried both enhanced Splendas and compared them to the regular Splenda.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials - Splendid!
review/text: Okay, I admit it, I'm a subjective candidate from the get-go. I'm a big Splenda fan. If I had my choice between natural sugar and Splenda, Splenda wins hands down. (I don't even consider other sugar substitutes because of their chemical taste and aftertaste.) I think Splenda's taste is far more mild, and, well, less sugary, sweet. When I add the no-calorie sweetener into my coffee or cappuccino, it goes down smooth and easy.<br /><br />After trying Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with Antioxidants, I was curious to see if it tasted as good as the original Splenda. Sure enough, it did. If a packet gives an extra boost (20%) of antioxidant vitamins C&E, all the better. If the vitamins are destroyed in hot drinks or too minute to make a difference in the body, who cares, if taste is what you are after. Sure, the added vitamin perks makes this product more expensive than the original Splenda, but, whether it actually does anything as far as wellness goes or not, one would like to think so, so, in essence, the consumer is paying a little more in order to rub their psyche the right way!<br /><br />In terms of the foil packaging versus the original paper packaging, again, who cares, if you want an artificial sweetness without an artificial taste, Splenda - with or without the wellness claims, is a sweet deal.

review/summary: Same Great Splenda Taste
review/text: I've always been a fan of Splenda.  It's all I put in my tea.  I was concerned that the addition of the anti-oxidants would change the taste, but it didn't. It's the same great taste.  I take plenty of vitamins/antioxidants so I don't really need them added to  my sweetener - especially since I don't use sweetener all that often.  For someone who wants to add antioxidants to their diet, this would be an easy way to do so.  The packets do have a different feel to them than the packets without the antioxidants. But then, the same is true of the Splenda with Fiber.  It's just different packaging.  Splenda, like most sweeteners is more expensive than regular sugar.  However, Amazon's price is cheaper than most of my local grocers.  And I'm willing to pay a tad extra no-calorie sweetener that doesn't have a horrible after taste.  This product is worth a little extra.

review/text: I have been a Splenda user for many years now.  I even bake with it when appropriate.  When I found out I had the opportunity of trying and reviewing the new Spenda Essentials with Antioxidants I was excited.  The product comes in several sizes but the one I tried is the 80 individual packet size.  This had the same great taste as regular splenda with the same 0 calorie, 0 Sodium, 0 Fat but with added benefit of Vitamin C and E which are proven super antioxidants.  Granted the recommended daily value % is only 20% for each vitamin...I feel that if you can get any extra nutrition from a product (especially antioxidants!) by just using something you normally use than go for it!  I applaud Splenda for giving us a great product with even more healthful benefits.

I've found it amazingly versatile, and have devised many simple recipes where its use is a huge bonus.<br /><br />Whether the anti-oxidants have had an effect I cannot say - but it assuredly is a delicious way to consume these.

review/text: I love Splenda - it is the first artificial sweetener that I've tasted in my lifetime that doesn't disappoint.  The sweetner in Diet Coke disappoints, leaving that dreadful metallic-can taste.  Sweet 'n Low and Equal have those sketchy side effects that are so well known.  But Splenda provides a smooth, sugary taste to beverages without the side effects.<br /><br />And, bonus, this has antioxidants in it.<br /><br />Why only 4 stars?  Well, we don't know for SURE that there are no side effects.  Splenda has only been around since 1998, and maybe the long term effects have yet to be seen.

review/summary: Splenda Plus...
review/text: I am not sure what I was expecting when I ordered this Splenda with antioxidants. Something more exotic than what arrived, methinks. Don't get me wrong, I use Splenda a LOT, and love the individual packets. What you get here is Splenda with some ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and DL-alpha tocpheryl acetate (fancy name for Vitamin E). Yeah, these are two antioxidants all right. They are cheap and plentiful. The box states that each packet provides 20% of the daily value of antioxidants, yet each packet contains less than 2% of them. I am not sure how the math works on this. They add no appreciable taste change to the product, which is great. I'm not certain I would not buy this again, particularly if the price point were significantly higher than individual packets of generic sucralose powder. I am more interested in the Splenda with FIBER. I will have to do my homework on that one, so as not to be quite as disappointed. What I'd REALLY like is for someone to market LIQUID Splenda...any takers out there?

review/summary: Improving The Best No Calorie Sweetener
review/text: I drink a lot of coffee and tea everyday,both the hot and the iced varieties and I need them sweetened as well.<br /><br />I got away from the use of sugar decades ago for the sake of my teeth and I have gone through a series of colored packets over the past several decades and the taste or after taste has often been as issue in these sweeteners.<br /><br />Starting in the 70's with the foul tasting but sugar-free pink packets I used for several years,then changing to the slightly better tasting blue packets that I used for several more years but both the pink & blue packets had that foul after taste that drove me nuts.<br /><br />Finally,a few years ago they came up with the Yellow packets,Splenda and I suddenly had a great tasting sweetener without the foul after taste and I figured I was set for sweetener the rest of my life,but the people at Splenda have another trick up their sleeve...adding antioxidants to each packet.<br /><br />Now each packet contains 20% of the daily value of Antioxidants in Vitamins C & E within each little packet and Splenda still has the great taste and lack of aftertaste that I've enjoyed for years.<br /><br />I take a lot of vitamins each day and try to eat a healthy diet and I think this adds a little boost in the right direction of my enjoyable daily beverages and improves them in a positive way that tastes Great.<br /><br />I will be using several of these daily!

review/text: Personally I have always preferred splenda over equal or sweet n low.<br /><br />I do believe that using a sweetener as opposed to just regular cane sugar is healthier for you. Even though there are some people that would disagree with that.<br /><br />Regardless, I like it and like this product. However, I couldn't really taste any difference in it from my regular splenda. I like  that it has antioxidants though, so since I already like splenda to begin with and since this has no difference in taste, I will be buying this one from now on for it's a bit more healthier than the original.

review/summary: be aware: you may get multigrain, instead of corn and rice puffs
review/text: For years, I've ordered Chedd-Airs from Snyder's own website when my local grocery store stopped carrying them.  They were delicious, all natural, and gluten free.<br /><br />Snyder's discontinued the Chedd-Airs and started its EatSmart line of snacks instead.  I noticed that there were two kinds of puffs, "corn and rice" and "multigrain" on the Snyder's site and knew the Chedd-Airs had been corn and rice.  I was going to order directly from Snyder's, but noticed Amazon had them here and with free shipping.  Long story short, I ordered them from here, and got multigrain instead of corn and rice.  I could have returned them, but I had never tried the multigrain ones so I decided to keep them and try them.  The multigrain puffs are okay...but nowhere near as good as the corn and rice puffs.  I later ordered the corn and rice puffs directly from Snyder's and was happy to find that they're as good as the old Chedd-Airs were.<br /><br />I should note: a friend of mine has since ordered these puffs from Amazon and she DID, in fact, receive the corn and rice puffs depicted in this description. So...I say to anyone ordering: you may get corn and rice or you may get multigrain.  In my opinion, however, the corn and rice puffs are far superior to the multigrain.

review/summary: Yummy!
review/text: First let me state that the product is actually the MultiGrain Cheese Puffs, not the White Cheddar Puffs that are described/pictured.  I was aware of this when I ordered, and the MultiGrain Cheese Puffs are what I wanted, so I was not surprised...just want to be sure those reading this are aware.  With that said, I originally purchased a bag of these from the grocery store when I was researching gluten free snack options for my niece who had just been diagnosed with Celiac Disease the summer before going away to college.  We are both cheese puff lovers, so finding a gf option for her was a priority!  I actually found that I like these better than the normal cheese puffs on the market...not nearly as salty, and the texture is very nice (the multigrain, that is...the white cheddar puffs are like eating cotton balls).  My boyfriend agrees.  We ended up ordering a box of 12 bags for ourselves, and while we were initially concerned that they would hit the expiration date before we could eat them all, we are learning that will not be a problem...these things are addictive!  We will likely need to order more within 6 weeks of the original order!  I do recommend purchasing a single bag at your local grocery store before committing to a full order from Amazon, though.

review/summary: Great tasting medium roast, slight hint of chocolate
review/text: Years ago I hated coffee, now I'm an addict. But I can't drink any of it black. This is my favorite of the CBTL brew capsules. It is rich and not bitter. I normally add a little flavoring to ANY coffee I'm drinking, whether it's espresso or brewed, and most often it's chocolate or some form such as chocolate flavored stevia. I put a swirl of whipped cream on top and a packet of sugar substitute. With the Viennese Brew, I don't have to add anything but a packet of sugar substitute and a dollop of whipped cream (it tastes so good as is).  If you drink it plain you may pick up a VERY slight hint of chocolate, but if you are eating something chocolate along with your coffee, you won't notice the nuance of chocolate at the finish.

review/summary: Best CBTL capsule I have tried, one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had
review/text: We bought our CBTL machine, the Americano (currently sold at BBB and ShopNBC and CBTL stores) around 2 months ago. We could not be more pleased with our purchase. Unlike Keurig it has 2 different pressure settings so you can get a real espresso. It produces excellent espressos. We are primarily coffee drinkers though and I have tried a wide variety. So far all of them have been good with the exception of the Kona which is just too light for my taste. But of all the ones we have tried the Viennese is my favorite.<br /><br />It is incredibly smooth and non-bitter. I have never had a bitter CBTL but this is the smoothest of the lot. Yet you still get a rich coffee taste and just a hint of sweetness. The French is my second favorite and if you like strong coffee you might like the French better. But this is just a perfectly balanced cup of coffee. I use the 10 ounce setting and it comes out perfect for me. I haven't had a better cup of coffee from any machine and I really don't think I have had one at a coffee shop either. Highly recommended.

review/text: Requires 2 capsules to make a good cup of coffee over, 8 oz or more. If you follow the directions on your CBTL machine and use just 1 you will end up with watered down and weak coffee. Using 2 caps is just not economical and defeats the whole purpose of the design. K-Cups are better for coffee then these little cups that only hold 1/2 the coffee needed for the job. Making 10 or 12 oz coffee with this is really just hot water.

review/summary: good idea, but too costly
review/text: I love Splenda and have been using it since it first debuted on the market. Unlike other artificial sweeteners, it has no aspartame (which I am allergic too) and it dissolves easily in hot and cold drinks. When I saw the Splenda essentials, I decided to try all three kinds.  I drink a lot of hot tea to help curb my snack cravings, and figured some added vitamins couldn't hurt.  The Vitamin B (and the Fiber) tastes the same as regular Splenda, so that's a plus.  Also, I do not like taking vitamin pills, so this is an easy way to get more B in my diet added to something I already use regularly.<br /><br />However, this product also has some disadvantages that will keep me from buying it regularly. First, the packets are not simple paper. They are foil-lined to keep the vitamin additive from hardening the Splenda. While I understand the necessity, it is inconvenient. I often spill a little trying to open them because I can't shake the granules to the bottom first. Second, it does not dissolve as easily, especially in cold liquids. It will dissolve, you just need to add it more slowly and stir a lot. Finally, and most critically, Splenda essentials are a LOT more expensive. A 400 count box of regular Splenda is $11 on Amazon Subscribe & Save as of this writing. In contrast, the Splenda Essentials with B vitamin is almost $15 for 320 packets. I found a similar price differential in my local grocery store and at Wal Mart.<br /><br />Overall, if these were the same price as regular Splenda, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them. As it is, I won't buy them again unless I have a coupon that makes it worth while. It's a good idea, but it's not worth the price hike.

review/summary: Same great flavor!
review/text: I love Splenda! I use it every morning in my coffee. I have diabetes so I definitely cannot use regular plain old delicious sugar. However, Splenda is approved by my doctors because it does not raise my glucose levels.<br /><br />Using Splenda with added B vitamins gives me that little extra boost of nutrients while still using the same product I've been using. B1, B5, and B6 are added to this product to help support a healthy immune system as well as maintain healthy hair and skin. Splenda has added 20% of the daily value of the B vitamins to their sweetener.<br /><br />For me there was no difference in flavor from the original sweetener and I'm very pleased with this product. I usually use the fluffier Splenda so it was a little more difficult for me to gauge the same amount between the two products. I did not notice a different smell but I've never really been that close.<br /><br />I do like knowing that I'm gaining healthy nutrients while still being able to enjoy food and drinks without all the extra sugar. However, it is a little bit more expensive than the regular sweetener. Which is normal because vitamins themselves are pretty expensive. I personally, think it's worth it.<br /><br />I think the important thing to keep in mind is that adding vitamins to your regime is healthy it's not a replacement for not eating properly. It's a supplement.

review/text: I think, personally as a regular Splenda user, this is just a way to fancy up something to be able to charge more for it.  It is a sweetener and does a decent job of what it is designed to do. The packets are made of a thicker paper than the plain packets. Not sure what the reason is for that except to make it 'seem' more special. Perhaps the Vitamin B in this *will* make a difference in the lives of people who have a lot of it every day, but your normal user....take a vitamin for your supplemental B.  I am skeptical of it being worth the extra cost or of it being a good way to get your daily vitamin B.  To me it is just screaming out gimmick.

review/text: It seemed like a good idea to get your Vitamin B for the day in your sweetner (20% in one packet, 100% if you use 5)but this one has a distinct smell of a vitamin B capsule that is not very pleasant. I'd rather not smell it first thing in the morning with my morning coffee. Also the powder sticks a little to the aluminum lined packet and must be opened carefully. The paper packets can be tapped to shake the powder to the bottom but in this one it clings to the inner part so you have to open carefully to avoid spilling. The lining is due to needing more protective packaging due to the additives in the product. I'd rather just use regular Splenda and take my vitamins separately.

review/summary: B vitamin Splenda; discussion of caloric content
review/text: Splenda is Splenda. That's easy. It works to create an illusion of sweetness. It can be most helpful if staying away from regular sugar is necessary. I was thin, too thin, for many years but gradually that changed. I still didn't have to count calories, just stay away from ingesting too much or too fatty food, but even that changed. Now I am analyzing my intake to eliminate the empty calories of cane sugar, corn syrup and the ilk, even the fructose of 100% fruit juices in favor of consuming the whole fruit.<br /><br />What's not easy is choosing whether to use an artificial sweetener. First of all, some people mistrust them, suspect them of being carcinogens etc. and ask whether the cure might be worse than the disease. Some of the other artificial sweeteners, which shall remain nameless, might bear investigation.<br /><br />But Splenda, which has only been available in the US for a dozen years, is sucralose plus dextrose and/or maltodextrin. Sucralose is actually derived from sugar but has no calories. The fillers add calories but not nearly as many as sugar. In addition, Splenda is heat-stable to 450F and does not add an artificial flavor to baked goods. However it is questionable whether the vitamins survive the heat of cooking.<br /><br />I find Splenda especially helpful in making desserts sugar-free when necessary, everything from puddings to pies to betties. This Splenda claims no calories, as do their other varieties. The actual caloric content of a single-serving, 1-gram packet [which is the size of the packet reviewed here] is 3.36 calories, which is less than a third of the calories of a single-serving, 2.8-gram packet of granulated sugar. FDA regulations allow foods to be labelled zero calories, "if the food contains less than 5 calories per reference amount customarily consumed and per labeled serving". So that gets just a mite tricky. Regardless of FDA regs, I feel it is questionable to emblazon the packaging with a claim of "No Calorie Sweetener" when it actually does have them.<br /><br />Another packaging issue is the description "Net Wt 2.8-Ounces (Pack of 4)". That made me think I would receive four packages of 0.7 oz. each which I could use in baking. But in fact there are 80 tiny foil packages suitable for use in individual cups of whatever, and the box states "Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar." No problem; you just need to be aware of what you will be getting as this stuff is really expensive.

What in the world would I do without it? No aftertaste and rats were fed gargantuan amounts with virtually no side effects. I figure if I have twelve a day I won't grow a horn. Love it.

review/summary: Tastes ok but don't like how it's made.
review/text: While I don't mind the taste of Splenda, it is one of the better no calorie sweeteners for not giving you that horrible after taste, I do not like the way it is made. If you want to know how it's made, just do an internet search and find out what chemical is used in making this sweetener and the fact that it doesn't get broken down by your body and ends up in the water. For this fact I will not use Splenda very often.

review/summary: Like It Better Than Regular Splenda:  Tastes "Fresher"
review/text: I don't use Splenda, but my husband does & he thinks this tastes "fresher" than regular Splenda.<br /><br />I did a quick taste test with both and I agree--this DOES taste slightly better than regular Splenda and seems to have an added dimension of flavor with absolutely NO "vitaminy" notes or aftertaste.  It actually tastes good and seems to have a slightly higher moisture content than conventional Splenda.<br /><br />The secret may be in its foil-lined packets or it might be that the added B vitamins add that extra dimension of flavor I'm detecting (a more natural "sugar" taste, to my palate).  Either way, I'm glad my hubby gets the added benefit of a few extra B vitamins with his sugar replacement; we'll be buying more for him soon.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for those who must limit their sugar intake but have a negative reaction to stevia, like my husband.  Each packet is said to provide 20% of the RDA for B1, B5, and B6.<br /><br />UPDATE 10-8-11:  Re-reading the label, I thought I ought to make "carb watchers" and those with chemical sensitivity issues aware of the ingredient list (Splenda Essentials actually contains less than 2% sucralose, the ingredient most of us think of as "Splenda").<br /><br />Here is the labeled list of ingredients, FYI:  INGREDIENTS:  Dextrose, Maltodextrin, contains less than 2% of sucralose, calcium d-pantothenate (Vitamin B5), Pyridoxine Hydrocholoride (Vitamin B6), Thiamine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B1).

review/summary: Just like original Splenda but with an extra bonus for your health.
review/text: I'm pleased to find that Splenda Essentials with B vitamins tastes just like regular Splenda. No odd flavor or any aftertaste that I've notice.<br /><br />Splenda Essentials comes in foil packets instead of paper. No doubt it is to protect the B vitamins from getting moisture. The packet is a little harder to tear open, but not by too much.<br /><br />When you purposely smell an open packet of Splenda with B, you can actually smell the distinct scent of the B vitamins. (It's not overpowering - you can't smell it just casually using it.) This is how I can "confirm" for myself that there are B vitamins in there, otherwise the powder is the same white stuff we know as Splenda.<br /><br />Splenda Essentials with B Vitamins. Just like regular Splenda but with an extra boost of B vitamins for your well being. No flavor, no aftertaste, nothing to spoil the Splenda goodness we've all come to enjoy. I like it!

review/summary: Tastes the SAME as regular SPLENDA, just BETTER for you ...
review/text: I am a HUGE FAN of Splenda.  I have been using it for years.  Many years ago, I used to ONLY use sugar (and a lot of it).  I have a real sweet tooth.  Anyway, I tried the pink and blue packet artificial sweeteners and did not like the weird after taste they left.  Once I tried Splenda, I was hooked.  I gradually weaned myself off of sugar and only use Splenda (and Jay Robb spoonable granulated Stevia).  I REALLY like Splenda to sweeten my tea and oatmeal.<br /><br />When I saw the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (basically Splenda with a BONUS, something good for you ... fiber, antioxidents or B vitamins), I decided to try ALL of them.  I really like the SPLENDA ESSENTIALS.  They all taste the same to me ... the same as regular SPLENDA.  The ONLY difference I noticed is the packaging.  It is not that THIN, yellow packaging.  It is a thicker (almost like a wet-n-dri wipe) package.  Other than that, I wouldn't have even noticed a difference.  I now use all three of the different SPLENDA ESSENTIALS (fiber, B vitamins and Antioxidents) to sweeten my tea so I can get the nutritional benefits of all three.

review/text: Splenda came up with a good idea adding B vitamins to their product.<br /><br />We tried the sweetener in a variety of products including tea, cereal and to sweeten kool-aid.<br /><br />It tastes like Splenda. That said, if you like Splenda, you'll like this. If not, you probably won't.<br /><br />We normally purchase Splenda in the bulk pack at our local Sams. I hope that they will offer this product in a bulk size in the near future.

review/summary: Same Great Splenda
review/text: I love the idea of getting a B-vitamin boost with my Splenda.  I've used these in coffee and also sprinkled on fresh berries and notice no taste difference from the usual Splenda.  Yes, the packaging is new and the foil-lined packet (for freshness) is just a tad harder to open, but c'mon, it's not THAT much harder.  I seldom use a full packet; crimping over the top of these little foil-lined packets to save for the next morning's coffee works great.  The foil inside helps the packet remain closed.  Love this product.

review/summary: Sweet, but not too sweet
review/text: I've been a Splenda fan since it first came out.  I was excited, then, to get to be able to try Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins.  B Vitamins provide energy, something most of us need in this stressful, sleep deprived age we live in.  The consistency of Splenda with B Vitamins is the same as regular Splenda. It's almost like sifted powdered sugar.  It is very sweet by itself, but two Splendas in my tea turns out perfectly.  I don't taste any difference between Splenda and Splenda with B Vitamins.  The packaging of Splenda with B Vitamins is different, though.  The packets are foil lined and a lot thicker than the regular packets.  This means they hold up longer in your purse, but they are also a pain because you have to dump each one individually, rather than all at once.  I love Splenda with B Vitamins and highly recommend it.

review/summary: Not Too Crazy About This
review/text: I'm a long time Splenda user, so I took this opportunity to review the Splenda with the vitamins B in it. Frankly, I can't figure out the rationale for putting vitamins in the Splenda in the first place.<br /><br />I can tell you that this tastes no different to me than Splenda without the vitamins. That's the good part. The bad part is that, I would assume to keep the product fresh with the vitamins in it, they had to put it in a foil-lined packet. I feel this is an inconvenience. The packets are harder to open, and therefore harder to pour the contents of the packet into the cup.<br /><br />I would certainly not pay anything extra for the vitamins in my Splenda. As I said, makes no sense to me. (Nor do I want them to put "fiber" in my Splenda, which I've seen advertised).

review/summary: just like regular, but with vitamins
review/text: I use Splenda every day in my coffee, and some days in tea. I tried these B-vitamin-enhanced Splenda packets, and I feel they taste just like regular.<br />Strangely though, they are packeged in a more "robust" paper packet - thicker paper. I thought it was harder to open.<br />I liked these just as much as regular Splenda, but because I also take a multivitamin every day w/ plenty of B vitamins as well as others, I don't really think the extra B vitamins in the Splenda Essentials is worth the extra cost.<br />Basically, if I saw Splenda Essentials in the coffee shop, I'd definitely take one to use w/ my coffee purchase. But for at home use, probably I will stick to buying regular Splenda for myself.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials with B Vitamins
review/text: This new, enhanced Splenda has 0 calories per packet and provides 20% of the recommended daily intake of vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (based on a 2,000 calorie diet).<br /><br />I have been using regular Splenda (both loose and in packets) for several years.  I don't notice any aftertaste (unlike the lingering taste of Sweet-n-Low which I can't stomach).<br /><br />I did taste tests with Splenda, Splenda Essentials with B Vitamins and Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants.  I tried all three with berries, tea and Greek yogurt.  I could not distinguish the difference between the three as far as taste or level of sweetness. They all dissolved easily in hot tea and mixed into the yogurt without any graininess.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, the packaging for Splenda Essentials with B Vitamins and Splenda Essentials with Antioxidants is different than the regular Splenda packets.  The enhanced Splenda products come in foil-lined packets while the regular Splenda comes in paper packets (similar to Equal and Sweet-n-Low).<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen information on the box about any potential side effects of consuming too much vitamin B per day. I suggest speaking with a doctor about whether vitamin B interacts with any medication you may take and whether there are any concerns with taking too much on a daily basis.<br /><br />I drink at least 10 cups of tea per day and am not comfortable taking 200% of the recommended daily intake of vitamins B1, B5 and B6 (especially since I also take a multivitamin daily).  I plan to rely mainly on the regular, non-enhanced Splenda (especially since it is significantly less expensive than either of the enhanced versions).

review/summary: Popular sweetener with bonus
review/text: I'll start by saying I am a long time and frequent user of artificial sweeteners. I use them in coffee, tea, and cereal, at least once a day every day. I don't really care if it is Splenda, or Sweet and Low, or Equal, or Truvia, or a generic brand. As long as it gets whatever I'm eating or drinking sweet without adding calories, I'm happy to use it. So to me, this is a familiar product that I felt works as it should: it sweetened my stuff. With the added B vitamins, I guess that is something that may be attractive to someone, but I don't really see that as a good reason to purchase this over another product. This sweetener didn't taste or feel any different. The packet is foil lined, presumably because of the added-in vitamins, but it still opened with a simple tear, just like always. It looked the same, had the same pourable consistency, and tasted the same - sweet. In short, this is good sweetener with what are possibly some healthy additives, and because it does exactly what it is supposed to, effectively and easily, I give it a full five star rating.

review/summary: one packet adds just a little sweetness
review/text: I am a regular user of Splenda sweetner and I generally use the granulated kind in the yellow box with the pour spout. Splenda is a decent sugar substitute, but, of course it is not really sugar so it has a bit of an after-taste/artificial taste to it. I don't mind it because I really don't want sugar, and I only use small amounts of sweetener. If you are used to using small amounts of Splenda already, the new Splenda with B vitamins will probably suit you just fine. I did not experience an unpleasant vitamin smell/taste that some reviewers reported, but I only use one packet per bowl of [generic]cheerios or cup of tea. Just a hint of is perfect for me, and the little extra vitamins (20% MDR of B1, B5, and B6) is a welcome plus. The packets are tough; they are lines with foil for freshness, so they are good to carry with you in your purse or car.

review/text: I am not sure how to review this product.  From a taste and dissolvability perspective, it is identical to normal Splenda.  For me, that is a good thing, but if you did not like it before or have avoided it because of health concerns, you will not like it now.  It also comes in nice foil-lined packets, presumably to sustain the vitamin quality properly.  The vitamin B is definitely a nice perk and it is a fun way to remember to add it to my diet.  While I have become a convert to liquid Stevia in general, for some purposes, there is just nothing that works other than Splenda.

The Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamin enhances your desire for sweetening without the guilt, it is after all, calorie free and packed with B vitamins.

I highly recommend this product especially so that it now comes as a no calorie sweetener.

review/text: Splenda Essentials No Calorie Sweetener with B Vitamins offers and easy way to add B vitamins to your nutritional regimen. I do use Splenda, to keep my daily carb count down (I have type 1 diabetes, so any carbs that go in my mouth means more injected/bolused insulin), so I am used to and enjoy the taste. I typically use quite a bit in my tea (20oz cup of tea = 5 packets of regular Splenda).<br />Each packet of Splenda w/B has 20% of the adult RDA for the included B vitamins.<br /><br />The first time I tried this, I decided to skip my daily B Complex tablet so I sprinkled 5 packets of the B version in my tea.  The first thing I noticed was that as I raised the mug to my mouth, I was not greeted by the sweet and calming fragrance of my favorite tea (SerendipiTea's Colonille black tea with vanilla) but rather that nasty vitamin bottle smell.  In my mouth, the vitamin taste wasn't as strong as the smell before I drank it, and I could stomach it but it definitely monkeyed with the usual calm & comforting ritual of my afternoon tea.<br /><br />The next time I tried it, I used 4 packets of regular Splenda and only 1 packet of the Essentials w/B.  I still got a hint of that vitamin-y odor and taste, but with repetition I'll probably stop noticing it.  Maybe.<br /><br />I'll update if I get used to it...

review/text: My first observation is that I hate the packaging,or the small envelopes the Splenda comes in. Compared to regular Splenda the package is stiff and harder to open. A small complaint, but one none the less. It makes tearing several at one time slightly more difficult. The taste is essentially no different than regular packet Splenda, and the consistency is also the same. I prefer granulated Splenda over the packets anyway, but there us no difference. As far as the benefit of the B vitamins, I think it is great to have a fortified food but have no way of really know how much is really in the product and the body really uses. It is only several B vitamins and not all of them, and I certainly noticed nothing different after consuming this Splenda for over a week. Overall, a good product but if it is going to cost more for this Splenda I will stick with the original.

review/summary: Same old Spenda, but with added vitamins
review/text: I use Splenda in my drinks and coffee, as I am conscience about my caloric intake. I was interested in trying Splenda with B vitamins as I have been tested before and had low levels of B vitamins and had to supplement in the past.<br /><br />B vitamins offer a lot of health benefits and the B1, B5, and B6 included is known to aid in metabolism and strengthen the immune system. B5 reportedly also helps with depression and anxiety. The amount contained in the packet of Splenda is 20% of the daily value based on a 2,000 calorie diet.<br /><br />I do believe in the benefits of vitamins and think that supplementing my diet with them as much as I can is a benefit. With the Splenda B, I cannot taste the addition of the vitamins, which is a plus.<br /><br />One thing I notice every time I use this Spenda, is that it feels much denser in the packet than the regular Splenda. It's heavier and the package is fuller. It makes sense because they are adding vitamins, but it always throws me off when I grab for it. I can definitely tell a difference. I would buy this Splenda again instead of regular Splenda.

review/summary: Splenda Essentials
review/text: Since I decided to go low carb earlier this year, I've tried a variety of sweeteners including Equal, Truvia, Stevia, Ideal, and Splenda.<br /><br />This is actually the third variety of Splenda I've tried. I've used the regular variety and Splenda with a gram of fiber. (That one tends to clump and not mix easily with cold drinks, by the way.) This particular variety has 20 percent daily value of B1, B5, and B6 in each packet. I'm not big into vitamins. I take them but have never noticed any appreciable difference in my day to day life. So to me, the most important aspect of an artificial sweetener is its sweetness. This is as good as regular Splenda. It mixes easily.<br /><br />I gave it 3 stars because Splenda is a rather average sweetener. A co-worker I know loves it. So if you love the regular Splenda and just want to throw in some vitamins, this is perfect for you. I only started using artificial sweeteners earlier this year and I am still somewhat of a sugar addict. For example, my friend uses 2 packets in her coffee. I'm barely satisfied with 4. For best effect (max sweetness), I've been mixing it with Equal. I received this advice from my mother who has been a diabetic for a few decades. From all my sampling this year, I'd say many of the sweeteners are on equal footing. My preference is for Truvia, but personal opinions will, of course, differ.<br /><br />Ingredients: dextrose, maltodextrin, contains less than 2 percent of sucralose, calcium d-pantothenate (vitamin B5), pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), thiamine hydrochloride (vitamin B1)

Here are my observations:<br /><br />Pros -<br />+ Great Tasting; tastes very close to regular Splenda, with only a slight hint of the Vitamin B that is mostly noticeable in cold drinks, and not at all in hot drinks or cereals<br />+ Vitamins; a good way to get your B vitamins<br />+ Foil Packet; thicker than the regular Splenda packets, these travel well in the pocket<br /><br />Cons -<br />- Vitamin Smell; these do have a distinct vitamin odor, but it is not overpowering<br /><br />While I will not likely buy these for daily use, they will be taken with me on trips since they travel better than the regular Splenda packets.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: No Difference Between This And Regular Splenda In Taste
review/text: I've been using Splenda for years. I didn't think this new Splenda With B Vitamins tasted any different than regular Splenda.<br /><br />I guess it's nice to have the added benefit of B Vitamins.  This Splenda With B Vitamins to help support a healthy metobolism does supply 20% of B Vitamins B1, B5 and B6 per packet.  I wish it also included B12, but it doesn't. That is a fair amount of B Vitamins from one packet.  I guess you really can't ask for anymore from one packet of a no calorie sweetener.<br /><br />The box has 80 packets, which is kind of odd, because I buy the regular Splenda in a box of 100 packets.  Not sure why this variety only has 80 packets, as the packets aren't any larger than the regular Splenda.  Each packet sweetens like 2 teaspoons of sugar. I added one packet to one large cup of hot tea.  It was just sweet enough, not to sweet.<br /><br />The Splenda Essentials line also comes in a fiber variety, as well as an antioxidant variety. I do like that this comes in separate packets to take on the go, as some restaurants do not have Splenda.<br /><br />Iam trying to cut down on my sugar intake due to an increase in my glucose level.  I have to say that Splenda is the most natural tasting no calorie sweetener.  I have tried Stevia but it has a weird taste to me.<br /><br />I like that you can use Splenda in a hot or cold beverage, as regular sugar doesn't desolve in a cold beverage.<br /><br />I really don't eat cereal with milk or fruit with sugar, but Iam sure this Splenda would work for that too, and foods like that.<br /><br />If you are trying to cut down on your sugar intake for whatever reason this Splenda with B Vitamins might be a good sugar alternative for you.  Or try one of the other varieties of Splenda Essentials.

review/summary: Some B Vitamins Help
review/text: I have been using regular Splenda in my morning coffee for quite some time. I had been taking a daily dose of multi-vitamins as well. Recently I was prescribed a med which conflicted with some of the the contents in the multi-vitamins so I had to stop my daily intake. I chose this Splenda because it provides B vitamins which are compatible with my prescription. I do not notice any difference in the taste or the smell of my coffee. It is just as delicious and aromatic as ever. I have not noticed any effect from the B vitamins but maybe that will change with use. Splenda is my favorite sweetener and this version is a winner.

review/summary: Same Great Splenda Taste!
review/text: As someone who's trying to eliminate sugar from her diet, I absolutely loved this. It's every bit as sweet as regular Splenda, but with the added benefit of B vitamins that many of us don't get enough of. I didn't notice any vitamin taste or smell as other reviewers apparently experienced, not even when I sprinkled an entire packet over one sliced strawberry. (Sweet tooth attack.)<br /><br />That said, I think it's important to remember that each packet contains 20% of the RDA for vitamins B1, B5 and B6. If you're a hard-core Splenda user, you should probably only use a couple of these packets per day since it IS possible to overdose on B vitamins. While B vitamins are water soluble, and most people simply pee out any excess, people with liver problems (NAFL, fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis and various other conditions) and people with kidney problems don't eliminate excess vitamins as efficiently as others and should be careful when taking more than the recommended daily amount of ANY vitamin.

review/summary: same sweet taste but a vitamin smell
review/text: The first time I tried these, I was a little overwhelmed by the vitamin smell.  I used a couple to sweeten some cranberry/orange juice and the drink tasted a little odd.  Not to be put off, I sweetened my coffee the next day with the Splenda w/B vitamins and couldn't tell any difference in the taste of the coffee.  Also, the coffee covered up that vitamin smell you get with B vitamins.  As for the drink from the prior day, the orange juice is what gave it a strange taste so I fixed another cranberry/orange drink today.  I gave a glass of the drink to a family member and she didn't notice any strange taste or smell.  As for the amount of B vitamins, there are three added to the sweetener and only a small amount so you don't have to be too concerned that you'll OD on B vitamins.  The packets are made much heavier and thicker than the paper normally used so the vitamins aren't exposed to light and lose potency.  All in all, I like these and will be trying the antioxidant version next week.

review/summary: Expected Great Sweetener, Unexpected B-Vitamin Smell
review/text: I was surprised at the strong "B-vitamin" smell of this sweetener when opening the packets.  There was no noticeable difference in the taste of the sweetener from the regular Splenda.  The serving envelopes are a bit heavier and must be made from paper that prevents light from reaching the product, perhaps to protect the vitamin content.<br /><br />If one truly needs a B-vitamin supplement, why not get the vitamins if you are going to use a sweetener anyway.<br /><br />I probably would not buy this Splenda product over the regular Splenda, only because I use a daily multi-vitamin supplement, and I was somewhat put off by the smell.

review/summary: Mostly Splendarific.
review/text: I am a big fan of Splenda, and the version with fiber. So I was expecting for the Vitamin B version to be a hit. The first thing that struck me was the smell -- a subtle, but definite aroma reminiscent of children's multivitamins. Makes sense, no? However, the Splenda stirred in easily and was as delicious and sweet as always.<br /><br />After trying it out, I did a "smell test" with my mom. The B version definitely smells different than the original (they did *look* the same to me, though). If you've got a very sensitive nose, you might want to stay away. But for most people, it's probably not a big deal. However, I *do* eat my multivitamin every day, so while I'm quite happy with this product, I'll probably stick to the fiber Splenda after I use up this box.

review/summary: A Slight Aftertaste
review/text: It's a nice additive, the B vitamins, but for myself, I didn't really notice a big difference in taste from the regular Splenda, which is a good thing, in my opinion. Don't mess with a working formula. I did notice a slight aftertaste in my coffee from using this Splenda versus regular sugar or even versus regular Splenda. Can't really describe it, it wasn't a bitter taste, more of it made my mouth feel a little more drier than usual. It wouldn't be enough to keep me from using it, but I think people should know if they are sensitive to aftertastes.

review/summary: Great Product
review/text: Splenda has added another great product to their line of no calorie sweeteners. Already a fan of regular Splenda and Splenda Fiber, I have added Splenda with B Vitamins to my pantry.  Being diabetic, anemic and having low energy, I did notice a little pep in my step the second day I tried this product.<br /><br />Splenda with B Vitamins boasts 20% of B1 (Thiamin), 20% of B5 (Pantothenic Acid) and 20% B6 (Pyridoxine) on its packaging. Like other Splenda products, this product is calorie free.<br /><br />I usually use two packets of regular Splenda in a cup of coffee, but I found that Splenda with B vitamins is a tad bit sweeter than its regular counterpart, so I only use one packet of the B vitamin counterpart.<br /><br />Amazon offers a great deal on a bundle of Splenda products. You can get Splenda with B vitamins, Splenda with Antioxidants and Splenda with Fiber for $64.85. There are four boxes to a package and each package has 80+ packets for a total of 960+ packets.<br /><br />This is an excellent product for consumers who are diabetic or are just looking to lower their sugar intake.

review/summary: Why not?
review/text: In addition to the "normal" Splenda product, the Splenda Essentials line, as of this review, consists of three varieties ... added fiber, added antioxidants, and added B Vitamins.  This review is about the Splenda Essentials with B Vitamins.<br /><br />The box contains 80 packets of Splenda (as opposed to 100 packets in the "normal" variety).  However, the individual packets in the normal variety are made of paper only, while the ones in this one (with B Vitamins) are foil lined and a little bit bulkier, and the box they come in is also a little larger.  I suspect that the foil lining is needed to preserve the vitamins.<br /><br />With regards to taste, I couldn't tell the difference between the normal and vitamin fortified varieties.  Other reviewers have commented on smelling a slight "vitamin tablet" smell when opening a packet, and I do too, although I don't smell it once I mix the contents into a drink.  Each packet contains 20 percent of your daily requirement for B1, B5, and B6.<br /><br />This product is about 25 percent more expensive than the normal Splenda. Whether this is worth it to you or not depends on whether you think it important to add more B Vitamins to your diet.  For most people taking a daily multivitamin table, the answer may be no.  However, there are arguments that taking one vitamin tablet a day isn't the most effective way to get your vitamins.  I already use the splenda with fiber variety and will add this product into my routine ... my regular diet isn't the best, and I figure adding some more B Vitamins several hours after taking my daily multivitamin tablet can't hurt.<br /><br />While this product is pricier than normal Splenda, it may be worth your while to consider as a relatively pain free way to add some B Vitamins to your diet.

review/summary: Nice little tweek
review/text: Overall, I notice no change in the sweetness or flavor of this sugar substitute through the addition of the B vitamins. The usual slim paper packet has been replaced by a slightly more bulky thickened packet to preserve the nutrient content, but otherwise the product can be used in the same manner as the original item.<br /><br />The nutrient 'boost' is only 20% of the RDA value of B-1, B-5 and B-6, all water soluble vitamins, so there is little worry of toxic overdose of the vitamins in a healthy person (although, 1,000mg/day of B-6 has been cited as a toxic level, it is unlikely that you would ingest enough without recourse to multiple bottles of B supplement tablets). B vitamins are associated with healthy metabolism, hair, skin, immune and nervous systems.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not the full complement of B vitamins, neglecting several key members: riboflavin (B-2), niacin (B-3), folic acid (B-9) and cyanocobalamin (B-12). The addition of a few B vitamins is a nice little value-add to the product, but does not replace my B Complex supplement. Based upon Amazon prices, I can get roughly twice the count of normal individual packets for close to the same price. As an aside, the fiber supplement version might be more worthwhile. P-)

review/summary: Slenda with B Vitamins, a different idea to help market
review/text: This new idea Splenda has come up with seems to be more of a gimic than anything else but I guess adding "B" Vitamins or Fiber can't hurt. I did notice a slightly different flavior in my morning coffee but not enough to be turned off by it. Now this new Splenda with added vitamins is packaged in a foil/paper wraper, this keeps it fresher and less likely to become stale or wet. I'll keep using Splenda but not sure if this one is worth spending more than the standard product. I have used the generic Splenda and have to say it's hard to taste the difference.<br /><br />* One other big point, the Packets are hard to open given the new foil liner, I wish they added a pull tab or at the very least score the edges so you have a starting point to help open each packet, who wants to fight with your Splenda before your first cup of coffee?

I'd give it 5 stars for overall rating if it had a vacuum packaged bag. After opening the shipping box, I could smell the coffee flavor strongly and noticed that the bag was NOT vacuum sealed. I wonder if it's supposed to be in that way or not. But still, I believe it should be vacuum packed.<br />Highly recommend it and I will buy more after using this bag for sure.

review/summary: Coffee Bean Direct Dark Sumatran Gayoland
review/text: Mini-charcoal briquets:  This Sumatran whole-bean coffee is a good example of an environmentally and socially Green choice that bears no relation to the drinkability (is that a word??) of the coffee.  If you like how Starbucks' coffee used to be, say, 20 years ago, or the same for Peet's until both companies began offering medium and light roasts, you might like this.  Otherwise, be prepared for a mouthful of carbonized coffee.  The dark roast is beyond an espresso roast and is equivalent to a French roast (= carbonization).  If this bean had any character or complexity, it was burned out of it before it was offered to the consumer.  Simply put, this coffee in the 5-lbs. bag I got (yes, I am stuck with 5 lbs. of it) is an abject failure.  This is why buying coffees from Coffee Bean Direct you haven't tried before in 5-lbs. lots is literally rolling the dice in the back alley.  I have a subscription which I will cancel.

It is divided into two sections, one for the base broth and then another for the spicyness. This way you can get the spice level just right for your tastes. It is a great broth too, not overly salty like some of them can be.<br /><br />The final point of awesomeness of this noodle bowl is that the name transaltes to green raccoon, and thats just cute. :)

The mix is exactly as advertised -- big, fresh nuts with little/no nut segments at the bottom of the tin.  The nuts are perfectly salted.  We've now ordered the four-package option four times over three months.  If you love pistachios and cashews, this is the mix for you.  I'm not a huge fan of almonds, but they add a nice dimension to the taste.

review/summary: I think this is a scam
review/text: it's advertised as 21oz, but they sent me an 18oz container.  I don't think there are even 21oz containers.  They refunded part of the money, but still charged me the full shipping.  I'm contesting that too, but you have to watch what you get here... not sure if I'd try to buy the 21oz again, just stick to the 18oz since I know they exist... :)

review/summary: Delicious and nutritious
review/text: I picked up a package at my local gym. I wasn't expecting to like it  but it was delicious. I only bought it because I was starving before my workout and knew I wouldn't be able to finish if I didn't eat something. The package is only 60 calories with 10g protein.

review/summary: a different olive
review/text: Lucques olives are unlike any I've ever tasted. They are not as salty as most olives and this is why they appeal to me.

review/summary: mediocre
review/text: i've probably eaten hundreds of lucques olives and hate to say that these were my least favorite.  the olives themselves were fine but the brine that they were soaking in had a funny taste that was different than any other i've had before.  olives - good.  brine - bad.

review/summary: Surprisingly Refreshing and Very Good
review/text: Coconut water and me do not mix.  I have tried all of the brands out there and was very satisfied with this flavor mix.  I know all about the health benefits and try to drink one a day.  Much better for you than Sports drinks!  If you drink too much alcohol, try this the next morning, it will help with the recovery!  This flavor mix was very tasty and does not have a coconut after taste.  It has the Passion fruit taste throughout the whole experience.  I would recommend since the price is lower here on Amazon!
