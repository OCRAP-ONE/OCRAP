review/summary: what did I do before these?!!
review/text: I love these and so does my son. I have tasted them and they actually taste good. They are great for on the go and are mess free.  The ingredients are all natural and packed with good stuff which is why I buy them :)  The sugar is little high for my liking but not nearly as bad as some organic baby yogurt. I would love if they would offer a variety pack but my son didn't seem to get sick of the same one since we are just about on our last one out of 16 packets!

review/summary: Great on the go food!
review/text: Our 20 month twins love these.  They are very convenient and usually pretty neat!<br /><br />I called the company because our UPC # matched a voluntary recall number from January of 2010 and they were very helpful in explaining the three ways to tell that it was not from that batch (wagon wheel top, "Cheer Pack" on the back, and expiration that would expire no more than 15 months from May of 2010).  Further more, they were confident that the voluntary recall got back all the products with faulty packaging.<br /><br />Very satisfied with this product and the flavor is good!

review/summary: Amazing taste, great packaging, wish everyone made such wonderful things for moms!
review/text: You cannot ask for a better product to feed your little one.  It tastes great (just try it), it is clean, and has 100% of Vitamin A for the day.  My little guy eats at least three "nozzle" foods daily and they are so convenient, I can stash them anywhere and not worry about them getting crushed or going bad.  We get the HappyTot ones because of the Salba grains added and the omega-3s in that.  They are wonderful.  Buy many and your baby will be a HappyBaby or HappyTot.

review/summary: great for toddlers, too!
review/text: My toddler (nearly 2 now) has been enjoying Happy Baby's foods since his first Puffs at 7 months of age. While he's not in the baby food stage anymore, I keep these squeezable pouches around for quick snacks and on-the-go eating. I can't really think of a single bad thing to say about these pouches. They're organic. They're all-natural, without any additives, salt, sugar, etc. They're incredibly convenient to throw into my diaper bag to have handy whenever my little guy's looking for a snack, or to add on to a meal that's not as nutritionally-balanced as I'd like. They encourage independent eating - by this age, he slurps them up entirely on his own (once I twist off the cap, of course). They're a great way to get a little extra veggie content into his daily diet, especially on days when he's not in the mood for the vegetables on his plate at mealtimes. The "super grain" blended in makes this one a particularly healthy snack, with a little protein added to the fruit/veggie combination.<br /><br />The butternut squash/apple flavor was an instant hit, sweet and yummy. My little guy reaches for these again and again.<br /><br />The only improvement I can think of? Making the price lower - these are somewhat pricey. Though the Subscribe & Save option helps a bit - thanks, Amazon.

review/summary: Awesome for on the go
review/text: My 10-month-old loves these, and I do too.  With a little help holding the pouch she can drain one of these pretty quickly through the straw cap so we don't need to worry about bowls and spoons when we are out. Although if you want to use a spoon, the travel spoon tip that boon makes for plum organics fits the cap on these also.  These are a little expensive for everyday, but when we are going out I love that I can just throw a couple of them into the diaper bag.  Then there is the fact that they are organic, healthy, without added sugar, and in BPA-free packaging.  And my daughter really likes the taste.  If I could give them 10 stars I would.

review/summary: Excellent food for a highly independent tyke
review/text: These pouches are wonderful! My son has enjoyed the spinach-mango-pear and butternut-apple flavors since he was 11 months old. They are easy for him to feed himself with, and now that he is 18 months old and wants to do everything by himself, I don't have to worry too much about him making a big mess. They're also excellent for during church or on long trips in the car.<br /><br />The only problem I'm having with this product is that they've become very popular over the last couple of months and I'm having a hard time finding them in local stores lately. So, I suppose this is a good thing for the company, but not so good for when I run out.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product to other mothers needing a less-messy, healthy meal/snack for their young ones. And I hope that with the increasing popularity, it will be more widely available in stores.

review/text: My son LOVES the happy baby pouches, so I bought a box of these. I thought the only difference was the size, but these Happy tot pouches have Chia Seed and it REALLY affects the flavor. He used to suck down the happy baby ones, but when I gave him this one, he took a taste and then refused to eat the rest. I tasted it and was put off, too. I bought him another flavor that he ate a little more of, but still not much. I'm really sad I didn't realize the extra ingredient, I wish they would have just left them as fruit and veggie pouches.

review/summary: Great product, can get cheaper at Target - CHECK FOR RECALLED POUCHES!
review/text: We love Happy Tots food. My 12 month old has tried many varieties and loves them all. He has not had one sour face yet! I'm surprised at the price here, you can get this item at Target for $1.09 per pouch which is much less expensive. I guess buying it online is helpful for people who don't have access to a Target or Health food store, and in that case, is worth the price.<br /><br />*** as a special precaution ***<br /><br />A baby food recall just issued by the FDA (Jan. 2010) may have some of the most stomach-churning details I've read in awhile:<br /><br />"Swollen or leaking pouches may indicate problems with the product, including possible contamination by bacteria that can cause illness, or that the packaging has been compromised and is at risk of bacterial contamination."<br /><br />The recalled food is made by Happy Baby, and it's a mix of the baby and toddler lines that parents should be throwing out. The recall covers:<br /><br />* HAPPYTOT Green bean, pear & peas, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00127 9;<br />* HAPPYTOT Sweet potato, carrot, apple & cinnamon, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00128 6;<br />* HAPPYTOT Spinach, mango & pear, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00129 3;<br />* HAPPYTOT Butternut squash & apple, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00130 9;<br />* HAPPYTOT Banana, peach, coconut & prunes, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00131 6;<br />* HAPPYTOT Banana, peach & mango, NET WT. 4.22 OZ. (120g), UPC 8 52697 00132 3<br />* HAPPYBABY Mango, NET WT. 3.5 OZ. (99g), UPC 8 52697 00134 7<br />* HAPPYBABY Spinach Mango Pear, NET WT. 3.5 OZ. (99g), UPC 8 52697 00139 2<br />* HAPPYBABY Apricot Sweet Potato, NET WT. 3.5 OZ. (99g), UPC 8 52697 00136 1<br /><br />The foods are sold in plastic pouches with plastic caps, and none are set to expire until late this year or even next year, so check through the stuff way back on your shelf. No illnesses have been reported so far, and Happy Baby's CEO Shazi Isram said in a company statement that this is a voluntary precautionary recall.<br /><br />If your pouches are leaking or swollen, the FDA advises you keep them away not just from baby but from your pets as well and wash your hands if you've handled the packages.<br /><br />Happy Baby directs parents to return them to the store for a full refund or contact them at 718-852-7606 or info@happybabyfood.com

review/summary: kids love it
review/text: so my 1.5 year old eats this as a snack and my 3.5 year old daughter always sneaks in a few "sips". i long since stopped using a spoon to feed him out of these packs which is the MOST CONVENIENT thing! my kids just hold it and suck on the tip like a straw. whenever we go on a slew of errands i throw one into the diaper bag (nothing else needed) and feel better about giving him this as opposed to some kind of "empty calorie" cracker with GMOs. HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (spinach, mango, pears) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with green beans AND peas, you would think the color would be closer to a light green rather than just pear. but in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!

review/text: So my 3 year old son gulps these down like there's no tomorrow! He loves them. I LOVE them because he's getting spinach a long with a ton of other nutrition. I tried getting him to try some of the other brands' pouches but he didn't go for it. Plus Happy Tot is the only one that contains protein, through a grain called Salba. I googled it to find out more about it...holy moly! Check out the nutrition facts on Salba![...]<br />So I never even tried looking for an alternative after that. Plus I found other amazing uses for it like using it instead of jelly on sandwiches, adding it to cupcakes etc. and...are you ready for this? Happybaby partners with an organization called Project Peanut Butter where they feed a child in Malawi, Africa anytime you buy one of their products. Sweet! LOve this stuff!

review/summary: My 9 month old love this stuff
review/text: I'm a new convert to pre-packaged baby food. I typically make all my son's food but even with glass jars with lids its a little messy to tote my homemade stuff when we are out and about. I saw these at Target one day and decided to try them. I LOVE this stuff now :) I love the fact that it's all natural and the packaging is free of any of the gooky stuff I don't want to put in my kid. When we are out, I don't even take a spoon. My son just sucks it straight out of the package. He is breast fed and occasionally bottle fed and he had no trouble figuring out how to suck these out of the package right away.<br /><br />The flavors I've seen are all mostly fruits with some veggies snuck in. This one tastes mostly like apples (yes, I did taste it :) I taste all my son's food). I would like to see some more flavors that also taste of veggies so they don't get too stuck on the sweet stuff.<br /><br />I also like the fact that if he doesn't finish all of this in one sitting, I can put the cap back on and save it for later. One negative is that on some of the packages I found that the first little bit that comes out is a little nasty looking. The rest of the package looks good and my son has not had a negative reaction. I usually just squeeze that bit out first and let him eat it from there.<br /><br />The price here on amazon is the best I've seen. With subscribe and save I'm averaging $1 or less per package compared to in stores where they average about $1.50 per package.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone, whether you make your own food for your baby or consistently purchase baby food. It's a winner.

review/summary: Perfect.
review/text: You mean you didn't know about HappyTot Organic Superfoods for Tots?  Well, I can see how that's possible since it has taken *forever* for this company to keep these pouches in stock anywhere!  We ALWAYS have these "fruit squeezies" (as our two-year old calls them) on hand in our pantry and in the diaper bag for a quick, wholesome snack.  They're portable and easy.  We just pop off the cap and he eats straight out of the pouch.  I also love that they've added the supergrain so that the kiddo gets a dose of omega-3s.  If you compare the nutritional information on the back of the product with other organic fruit-pouch brands, you'll see that HappyTot pouches and the other HappyBaby brand pouches actually have nutritional value in them.  Some of the others (I'm looking at you, Revolution Mashups) hardly have any nutritional value at all--not even vitamin C in some flavors.  I gotta say that my son loves all of the HappyTot fruit-veggie combos, though my palate not so much.  Doesn't matter; as long as he likes them and he's getting something more nutritious than the plethora of junk food on grocery store shelves, I'm a HappyMom!

review/text: My daughter LOVES this baby food! She actually reaches out to grab the pouch if I am not feeding it to her fast enough. I wanted to see if I could buy it in bulk. I was shocked at the prices Amazon was selling it for! I went to Target and found them anywhere from $.89-1.49 a pouch. Way cheaper! Sure hope Amazon realizes this and does something about it. This is an amazing baby food. They have a wonderful variety of products and I intend to keep feeding them to my daughter. Love that they're organic, easy to take with you, have fiber (which babies often need when they start solids), and the flavors are delicious (my other two older children and myself tried them).

review/summary: Great Snack Item
review/text: My children (almost 3 & 1-1/2) love squeezable fruit & veggie pouches.  This product is a great way to sneak in veggies for picky eaters and a great way to have variety and meet your daily values when out and about; I also find them to be a great snack. However, it is very difficult to find pouches with veggies at the local stores; mostly fruit pouches are sold, not many organic ones.  So I went to Amazon.  While I was happy to find Happy Tots by Happy baby (one of my favorite brands) the price was not that great.  I later found it for substantially less ($2 less) at a local organic market.  As to taste, while i've tried all other flavors and levels/stages, I will say that there is a particular taste to the Happy Tots because of the addition of a particular grain (Salba).  Give this product a try and see if your kids like it.

review/summary: Good ingredients and taste
review/text: Our daughter is 9 months old and loves this food. She can sometimes eat a whole container at one sitting!<br /><br />In addition to it being organic and having interesting flavor combinations (without getting too bold with the spices, which can turn our daughter off), I like that the food contains salba seed. According to my research, salba is fibrous and absorbs water, so it helps with digestion. If your child tends toward constipation, as ours sometimes does, this can really help move things along without being harsh. I also like the combinations of fruit and veg used in these pouches, which keeps the food from being overly sweet yet makes some of the trickier vegs more appealing.<br /><br />We have tried four different kinds of the Happy Tot pouches and all of them, even the one with peas in it, have passed the test. She actually gets excited when she sees one of us coming with a pouch in our hands!<br /><br />I make it a point to taste everything that I am feeding to our daughter. I think these foods taste good and have no reservations about giving them to her.

HOWEVER, with this product and the other happybaby flavor i purchase (green beans, pears, and peas) i don't like how it appears on the front that the veggies are a predominant ingredient. the ingredient list on the back (and the color of the food itself) tells you that there isn't as much vegetable in there as there is pear. for something with spinach you would think the color would be closer to a green rather than just pear/mango. i've made tons of baby food at home and anything with a good amount of spinach (since they place it first and list it first on the FRONT, but the ingredients show otherwise) turns green! i suppose they keep it to a small amount to avoid deterring kids by the color.<br />in the end, if he's getting organic pear with a side of organic veggies and a dose of omega 3s, it's better than goldfish crackers any day!

review/summary: My kids love it but I can get it for less at Target
review/text: My kids love this.  The first time I fed it to them they asked for another pouch. One is very picky and both hate veggies. They are 3 yr old twins and eat big kid meals, but I love the portability of this pouch and it makes a great nutritious snack to take on the go. I especially love that it is Organic.<br />I want to note that I did NOT buy this product on Amazon. I found it at Target for 99 cents each. I thought I could find it on Amazon in bulk for less, but instead it cost almost 3 times more. I'll buy it at Target instead unless that changes.

review/text: I love all of these products.  This is my favorite "flavor" to give my 11 month old.  I use a spoon at home, but if we're out, I just hold it in his mouth and he sucks it all right up!  It has veggie, fruit, and grain (super grain Salba) all in one.  My older son never got the variety of veggies that this one is getting from these products!

review/summary: Tastiest Baby Food - Approved by Picky Baby
review/text: My little guy won't eat much of anything else, but Happy Tot pouch foods.  Besides being tasty and organic, he loves sucking the food straight out of the pouch!  He just doesn't seem to like being spoon fed, and although he likes feeding himself - he doesn't get much when he does it.  With my help, he can eat almost an entire pouch in one sitting!  One big problem is I can't seem to find them anywhere!

review/text: This is a great beginning food for infants and a great snack for toddlers!  My 2-year old son loves them and asks for one a couple times a day.  It's a good way to get extra fruits and vegetables in their diet during the picky eater years.  If you get them through Amazon subscription services, it's a big savings.  I also used them in baking instead of applesauce to replace oil or butter AND add extra nutrients.

I try not to use it as a replacement for my 10 month old experiencing real food textures - but it's hard b/c he loves them so!!  This is our favored flavor of all the pouches(plum organics, elles kitchen, etc).  It is sweet, but not any sweeter than a plain ol banana!!

review/summary: Great for toddlers! They are yummy, but don't completely mask the veggie flavor
review/text: My son is 16 months and, while he is a balanced and good eater, I still feel he needs more vegetables during the day.  I try to send portions of canned veggies to day care (which, sadly, are his favorite -- I think it's because they're soft and he only has 5 teeth -- I buy the "no salt added ones"), but I don't think they really worry about whether he eats the veggies as long as he eats SOMETHING.  WELL, with these pouches I don't have to worry as much that he isn't getting the nutrients and exposure to the flavor of the veggies.  He will drain these pouches in a second and then keep handing it back to me to so I can squeeze it to get the last drops to come out.  Sadly for him, he can already get the last drop out on his own so I have to tell him it's all gone.<br /><br />And, just in case you're worried they are mostly fruit, you're probably right.  Pear is listed as the first ingredient with peas and green beans listed after.  But, I did taste this one and it tastes exactly like pear sauce and pea puree mixed togehter.  It was pretty sweet, but so are actual peas. I was impressed that the pear flavor didn't completely mask the pea flavor, so he is still developing a taste for vegetables, not just fruit.  Bottom line -- he loves these and it is better than no veggies at all!<br /><br />I give it a 4 only because they are (too) pricey.  I get that they are organic, so maybe they have to be that expensive, and it's expensive packaing, but $1.50 per pouch is a bit much.  You can buy pouches like this from Motts and other companies (in boxes of 4) that are just apple sauce or apple/strawberry sauce for much, much cheaper.  Likewise, Beechnut makes some with sweet potato and pumpkin that are $.99.  The thing is, none of those products include any GREEN veggies, which is why I shell out the $ for these.  I suggest buying in bulk because it will save you a little $ and you're going to want to have one for every day.

review/summary: Only Fruit My 14-mo will Eat
review/text: My son is 14 months old now and has hyper sensitive gag reflex, making it difficult for him to eat any foods with texture. Add to it that he's not into fruit -- prefers veggies and more bitter (i.e., plain yogurt) and you have an extremely picky eater. I purchased a box of these hoping that he'd like the taste of the mango enough to mask the other fruits. He'd been getting constipated and I knew he needed more fiber, not to mention vitamin C. Well, he loves these. He loves the taste and he loves that he can feed himself (which is extremely important for a small guy like him with so many developmental delays). The fact that selba has omega-3 is an added bonus for brain health.

review/text: My daughter is picky 17 month old whom I have to battle when it comes time to eat.  She only will eat about 10 things so getting veggies introduced into her diet has been hard.  The pouch is a great concept since my daughter loves being able to feed herself. She loves the mango and spinach and gobbles it up within minutes.  Yes, you can find these cheaper in stores when on sale, but as a busy full time working mom the ease of ordering off Amazon and not having to go to the store is a lifesaver!

We've been using them for 3 months now, and my kid (now 12 mo) has since refused to eat jarred baby food, but will still suck these down without any complaints.  Try them and I hope they help make your life a little easier too.

This brand is my favorite of the various pouches out there, because it also has antioxidants, omega 3s, as well as fiber and protein. So on those days when he doesn't eat as much (due to teething or whatever), I feel like he's still getting a lot of nutrition from this one pouch. We stock our pantry with them!

review/summary: Very convenient
review/text: I have a confession to make: I eat baby food. I'm not a kid, and I'm not even a mother, so I can't make the excuse that I'm testing it to make sure it tastes okay for my baby. I'm a college student with no kids. It's just so easy! And baby food and dog food are so much healthier than adult human food most of the time (no, I don't eat dog food too!).<br /><br />These are the things I like about this particular item. It's super convenient with its little pouch that you can carry with you wherever you go and drink out of. It's mess-free. It's extremely healthy, with fruits, veggies, and chia seeds. It's also fairly low in sugar compared to a similar product I have also tried, the Peter Rabbit Organics pouches (11g compared to 12-23g). Plus it's cheaper.<br /><br />The only things I don't like about this product are the taste and texture, but if your baby doesn't know better, (s)he might not mind. The Peter Rabbit Organics brand has a better taste, although with twice the sugar in some varieties, it's not hard to imagine why. The texture of the chia seeds is also annoying, but I put up with it because a) I already paid for it and b) they have Omega 3s, which are very good for you.<br /><br />With subscribe & save, I paid about a dollar per pouch, which isn't too bad. It's not too filling for an adult, but when paired with a mini Clif bar, it makes a healthy snack for less than the Fillet O Fish I would otherwise get at McDonald's.

review/text: I love baby food pouches!  I am a mom of four children, all born with 5.5 years of one another.  I used pouches for the first time with my latest baby, now one year old at the time of this writing.  Anyhow, since the pouches can be somewhat pricey, I opted to buy a box off of Amazon.  I am pleased with the product and the price, which saved money through the Subscribe and Save program Amazon offers.  I especially like HappyTot because its organic, and the different combinations of fruit/veggies has proved to be appealing to my child.  In addition to this, the addition of salba seed offers some fiber and extra nutrition.  I feel good that I can trust the contents of what I am giving my little one.  Once a baby can hold a cup, I would recommend giving them a pouch too.  In time, it has proven helpful, as opposed to spoon feeding.

review/text: I picked this product because it's healthy and sounded yummy. It had lower sugar than most and a good amount of protein. I was hoping my toddler (as a quick smoothie-type snack) and my 7 month old (as a meal) would both enjoy it. I rated it a 3 since my baby seems to be ok with it...but my toddler won't touch it! Good thing they have a long shelf life!

review/summary: Taste not to my child's liking.
review/text: The pear, pea, and green bean flavor is not a winner in our house.  My 13 month old spit out the first taste. I've tried it several times with her, even chilled from the fridge. But she doesn't like it. I tasted it and the pea flavor is prominent.

review/summary: My picky eater (with food allergies) loves this!
review/text: My son loves this product - it is healthy, convenient (packaging) and since he refuses all other greens we've tried, this is a good way to encourage him to eat green veggies.  The one drawback is that the price is on the high side.  I am now wondering if it is worth the value, and will probably try other alternatives if price continues to go up.

review/summary: Happy Tot Squeeze Pouch: Apple & Butternut Squash
review/text: YUMMM! We found another yummy flavor from Happy Family Brands!  So my daughter whose three eats these like they are a smoothie and with them being so easy to put in your bag or her backpack, it's such a reassurance that she's enjoying a healthy snack even away from home and at school.  Withh their easy twist top, even if she doesn't finish the whole thing, it is a nice feature you can put the cap back on for later; though it is so rare that she doesn't finish it all up.<br /><br />This may be one of her new favorite flavors, she really likes seeing what is in her pouch each time and asks for this flavor a lot.  I think the size is great for a toddler, so glad they combine fruit AND a veggie; plus being organic, I'm a happy mom :)

review/text: I cannot say enough about these Happytot pouches!! My toddler loves them! I have to remind my daughter (who is in elementary school) that these are for her brother and I have other snacks for her! I love that it contains the salba. Anyway that I can get the Omega 3's in my picky toddler's diet I am all for it. I am also very happy anytime I can find healthy foods that are gluten/dairy free. I have actually tasted these myself and I think they are great too! When I compare the ingredients to other organic pouches they are by far the healthier choice.

review/summary: Versatile Pouch
review/text: All Mom's know how convenient these pouches are for snacking on-the-go and to encourage self-feeding. I also pack it in lunch bags. NO JAR, SO NICE! However, I also use it as a spread with cheese on a sandwich. It's a great way to hide the veggies for my younger son who is so picky about veggies. Another reason why I love Happy Tots is because they sweeten up the veggies with a fruit. This definitely appeals more to my younger son more than the pure vegetable pouches.

review/summary: Veggies on the go!
review/text: Organic green beans, pear, and peas, in a portable bpa free pouch? Yes please! Best idea ever. To be honest, I do not like green beans, therefore don't cook them at home. My kids do love peas though. So, when I saw this, I thought we would try it, since that's the only way my kids will get green beans from me. And to our surprise, this is really good. I love the fact that HappyFamily adds organic vegetables to their food, and not just fruit, like other companies. Also, I love how they add the super grain SALBA (from the white chia seed) to some of their foods. This is a great way to give my kids the protein, fiber, and omega 3's they need. Plus one of my kids is gluten free, and SALBA is a GF grain she can eat. Great job HappyFamily.

review/summary: Love The Flavor Combo
review/text: I love this baby pouch.  I feel like some of the baby food flavors aren't very creative.  I love to cook and plan on having my kids eat what I make for them each night instead of cooking them their own 'dinners'.  Having unique flavor combo's like Banana, Peach and Mango, helps my baby to develop his taste buds.  You don't see Mango everyday in baby foods.  I use it all the time in smoothies and as snacks for my toddler.  Sometimes I don't have the time to cut up fruit, sit him in the highchair and then clean up the inevitable mess that follows.  Giving him one of these pouches, I know he is getting all the goodness of organic fruits and veggies.  We kept them in our freezer this summer and used them as a treat in the afternoons.  Just let it defrost for about 10-15 minutes and it becomes easier to get out of the pouch, but is still icy and cold.

review/text: What can I say... most portable baby food, with a resealable screw top. Tasty organic fruits I trust and great nutrition in a pouch. My daughter has been loving these since she was 8 months old (she'll be two in two weeks). It travels very well and doesn't take much space in the diaper bag. If she doesn't finish it (which is extremely rare), I can always put the cap on and refrigerate for later.

review/text: My son is 16 months and loves this product! It's so difficult to get him to eat fruits and vegetables by themselves, but in this little pouch, which has both, he will eat it every time hands down. He loves it! And I have not found another company out there that can give your child what this one does - antioxidants, omega 3s, fiber, protein and Salba, this awesome super grain. Not to mention it's all organic. This particular one is a favorite of ours because of the cinnamon. Philip loves the taste of cinnamon. As a first time mom, it's great to know that I have an option out there for a tasty snack to give my son that is super healthy for him. Not to mention this on-the-go type pouch is really convenient. I highly recommend it.

review/summary: Gotta Love These Pouches
review/text: I started purchasing these for my daughter when she was about 9 months old.  We started with the Happy Baby pouches and she has been a fan ever since.  I'm a fan because these pouches allow her to self-feed without a lot of mess.  This is especially great when in the car.  I love the combos of the pouches too.  I even tried a few of them myself and they don't taste too bad!  Since my daughter's gotten older, I have started to be a little adventurous and add these pouches to things like pancakes and oatmeal in the morning!  She's getting an intake of fruits and veggies without even knowing!

My son takes them in his lunchbox, my husband sucks them down on his way out the door and I use them as a baking substitute all the time! (you can omit veg oil and use equal amount of this).

review/text: My 2-yr-old son has been eating HappyFamily products consistently for over 6 months now and this packet is one of his favorites by far. I'm so glad we can throw these in the car for last-minute snacks (my son has thankfully never seen a drive-thru thanks to HappyFamily packets). I appreciate that there are vegetables (sweet potato & carrot) in these while he loves the taste of the apple. I especially like the twist of adding cinnamon, probably why it's one of his favorites. He now knows how to squeeze every last drop out of these and often asks for more. They're also great for putting in his pack for school for an optional snack (because not all schools can afford 100% organic foods). Not to mention they have BPA free packaging and no GMOs. These also diminish the need to make and package your own food (I'm so over those days). Genius!

review/summary: Good for baby and easy for you!
review/text: Anything that is portable and easy is a great thing for a parent.  My son will happily eat these pouches over 'real' food even though he is way past the age of needing pureed food.  These come in real handy when you don't want to give a messy snack that is unhealthy as well.<br />The only downside, TSA is VERY inconsistent with the baby food allowance.  Sometimes we have been allowed through with these with no problems.  Other days (more often than not) we have either had to have each opened and tested or agree to the full body search (no thanks with a wily toddler).

review/summary: Great for kids, perfect for travel, what's not to like?
review/text: This is for HappyBaby Happy Tot fruit pouches. These are excellent for kids. My 2 year old loves it. She asks for it every morning and everytime she takes a bath. It's great - totally organic with all natural ingredients and no harmful chemicals, GMO's or preservatives! It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it.[...] Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website.  [...]) Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. (http://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch/SafetyInformation/SafetyAlertsforHumanMedicalProducts/ucm197570.htm). In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.

It does not need to be refridgerated so wont take up space in your fridge (although once it's opened it does, as do most products). It's great for kids at least half a year old and is recommended by the well known Dr. Sears, TV personality, author, and acclaimed professor at UC Irvine.<br /><br />The container is well made and does not flap around. It can stand up on its own as it has a base that is round and designed to stand up - other containers will lay flat and leak out when the child puts the pouch down. It also has a brighly colored plastic cap that, before opening for the first time, cannot be removed by a small child. You will need to open it for them. The cap is large enough that small 2 year old hands can manipulate it open and closed without much difficulty. The cap is also color coded to match the packaging design, so you can easily and quickly identify which one you want. Likewise, the packaging is colorful and well designed. It shows pictures of the fruit on the side and writing for the adults so you can choose your variety.<br /><br />The fruit variety is tasty. I have sampled some of it and found it to be pretty good for smoothies and adult meals! Regardless, it's a child's drink, so the focus is on how much the children enjoy it. I find that no child has objected to the flavor, although some flavors certainly get unique - who would want to eat broccoli and pear together? Butternut squash and apple is certainly a savory combination. Spinach and mango? Doesnt matter. My kids love all flavors. Sure, some have preferences, but these are great combinations and are supremely healthy.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I had no clue what Salba was, so I googled it. [...]Evidently it's a SUPER healthy grain that is an excellent source of Omega 3's, fiber, magnesium, calcium, antioxidants, folate, and dietary fiber. Evidently it's also better than Chia and Flax seeds as well. This all comes from the Salba website so it's obviously to be taken with a grain (no pun intended!) of salt, but still, that sounds fantastic to me. Surely this cant hurt a growing child's system!<br /><br />While other reviewers have noted that this product is available for cheaper at Target for $1.09 per pouch. I have not been to the Target store lately so I cannot verify that, but I did a price comparison on Target's online website. [...] Again, I did not go into the store - you might be able to find this in the store for cheaper. As of 6/7/12, the cheapest pack was $10.16 cents for Spinach, Mango and Pear, and Broccoli, Pear and Peas, or $20.32 for 16 of them. In my state, we have 6% sales tax ($1.22), which turns that total into $21.54 for a 16 pack, or $1.34 per drink. Compare that to Amazon's price, which is $19.20 (no sales tax) for SMP and $19.86 for BPP. You can also sign up with subscribe and save, which will yield a 15% discount, or a total of $16.32 for SMP, or $16.88 for BPP. That's a savings of $3.44 to $4 total, or over a quarter for each item. Green Beans, Pears and Peas sells for $19.52 or $16.59 for S&S on Amazon, vs. $24.25 at Target (online pricing, but I added sales tax), which is a $7.66 price difference! Again, these are NOT in-store prices, just online prices.<br /><br />You should be aware that there is a recall on some HappyBaby pouches. Pay attention to those expiring between November 2010 and January 2011. The press release indicates that nobody has been hurt and no harmful bacterias have been found. [...]. In fact, one of my pouches started swelling up, so I threw it out, but my daughter enjoyed the rest of the pouches from that batch (I sampled them to be sure) and was fine. I just assumed it was a bad pouch but now I know that there's a recall, so I will be keeping an eye out, as you should. Does not mean you should give these up - there have not been any harmful effects and it appears to be a bad batch which the company has corrected.

review/summary: perfect for on the go
review/text: I baby sit my brother's 2 and 3 year old kids occasionally on the weekends and this is the perfect go to snack when we're at the park. Since they're so use to eating indian food and never really had packaged baby food, I was scared to try this on them at first. Surprisingly they really liked it. I usually give this to them with whole wheat crackers or a granola to last them over till their next meal. My brother and sister in law are happy that I'm not giving them junk food!

review/summary: Yum, Yum, and Double Yum!
review/text: There's only one way to describe DeLallo Soft Torrone, "That's amore!" As the product of a very Italian family, I grew up thinking torrone was the greatest food ever created. At every holiday, my grandfather would bring out the torrone, and all the cousins would gobble it down--not that you could ever get enough to satisfy us. DeLallo Soft Torrone lives up to all those memories--and it may very well be the greatest food known to mankind. Nougat, almonds, edible paper--who could ask for anything more?

review/summary: Different from La Florentine, but equally as good
review/text: I usually buy the La Florentine brand of torrone around the holidays as stocking stuffers (OK, so I just possibly might sort of maybe eat one or two or three or so myself...). However, this year it was not sold by Amazon, and the shipping charge from the third party seller was a bit too steep. So, I tried the Delallo brand.<br /><br />It is different than La Florentine, but equally good. It seems to be a bit less sweet, but is very flavorful. The nuts are very fresh tasting, and there is an abundant number of them. The individual candies come very nicely packed as well, which is important for me for gift giving.<br /><br />I would certainly buy these again even if my usual brand was in stock. Highly recommend.

review/summary: Family did not care for this brand
review/text: We all were each trying to give away our boxes to the other, because we just didn't like this brand. There was no taker. We had previously purchased the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO615O">La Florentine Torrone, Lemon, Orange, Vanilla, 6.35-Ounce, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)</a> and we loved them (although the lemon was loved the least). I am not sure what it is and possibly it was because the Post Office delayed our box at a very hot location for days (thus I gave this two stars). Yes, they were dried, but they also just didn't have that something the La Florentines did.<br /><br />Also, maybe I had missed it on the product review, but I had thought that these came in just one flavor. They don't. They come in Vanilla, Classic, and Lemon. Hope that helps.

review/summary: Terrible Tea!!!
review/text: Sadly, this tea neither tastes nor smells of jasmine flowers. It is impossible to tell the difference between this tea and generic Lipton. This is an absolutely terrible tea!<br /><br />Having lived in Asia for many years, I genuinely enjoy the elegance and subtlety of fine jasmine flowers blended with green tea. Occasionally, I prefer the convenience of individual bags for those times I don't wish to brew an entire pot of loose leaf tea.<br /><br />I have been very happy purchasing Lucky Eight Jasmine Tea on Amazon and should have stayed with this wonderful product. Unfortunately, my attempt to try another brand of jasmine tea from China resulted in a very poor choice. I am returning the Golden product for a refund.

review/text: I totally believe that if you eat this product (without adding milk, honey, brown sugar or anything else) that you will lose at least 10% of your body weight after one month.  It has happened to me several times, so I believe it.  It tastes great, and is good for you.  What else do you need/want?

review/summary: Fabulous - but don't buy it here!
review/text: This stuff is fabulous.  The flavor is intense yet mellow, a nice true fig flavor and not too sweet.  The seeds are nice and crispy.  This brand is expensive - about 6 or 7 dollars at my local stores that carry it - but this price on Amazon is truly crazy.<br />Here's a good way to use this stuff:  Make a grilled sandwich with turkey breast and a little brie cheese, and on one side inside the sandwich spread a bit of fig spread.  Just need about a Tbsp...and on the other inside, a touch of mayo if you like.  Use big sourdough bread.  Lightly butter the outside of sandwich and grill or cook in panini press, if you have it.<br />OMFG it's GOOOOOOOOOD.

review/summary: Tasty!
review/text: They used to carry a large jar of this at a local store, but I never saw it again after a few years ago and was deeply saddened. It is delicious with brie on a cracker (though I found out I am allergic to dairy so no more for me!) but it can also be used as a glaze, eaten on french bread, toast or in spoonfuls from the jar! I love this stuff. I only wish it came in a big tub that would last you the rest of your life.
