review/summary: Impressed! But expensive
review/text: I am impressed with the taste. The first thing the "almond & cashew" bar reminded me of was pecan pie, yet it doesn't even have any pecans in it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Taste<br />* Good ingredients<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Expensive<br />* Not larger? Only 1.4oz<br /><br />Other:<br />* Bar says "Made in Australia"

When I openned the package this morning I was so confused if there was anything wrong... Instead of 12 fruit bars, there were only 8!!!! I shop at Amazon all the time and never complain or anything but this is so RIDICULOUS! I couldn't believe my eyes I just thought that I was wrong. But I keep counting over and over and there were just 8! Now I don't want to say anything but so mad!

review/summary: TO SWEET
review/text: May 15th, 2012 9:04 am<br />  I bought this product[KIND PLUS, Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio + Antioxidants Gluten Free] for my grandchildren for a healthy snack at school!<br />  When it came I tried it, it was very tasty, but very very sweet and it had something in it that was so hard to bite, that I thought it would chip my tooth! I told my daughter my concerns, but she said she would try it and let her children try it as well!<br />  They found nothing wrong with it!<br />  It was very tasty as I said, but I can not of good conscience recommend this as a healthy snack!  It is extremely sweet and children should be where they can brush their teeth after eating it! Which they would not be able to do at school!  I would not want whatever that tiny hard thing I bit on[maybe a hard grain] to chip a child's tooth. The adult should try it first to see if they want their child have this either as a for snack for school or for outside playing!<br />  As I said it was very tasty, but it was hard and just to to sweet! I first gave it 5 stars, but I felt I was not being honest when I am trying to eat as healthy as I can! I will not buy this product for my grandchildren nor for me again! And I love nuts/grains/fruits and all the Antioxidants this product offers, but it is just too sweet and that out weighs any nutritional value you gain! If The maker would not have it so sweet as it is, then I would try it again and then could give it a better review!  Not everything that sounds healthy is healthy! We see all the healthy stuff and then think wow this is good for us, but we neglect to notice the larger amounts of fats or salts or sugars that has been added and then it is not as healthy as we thought! It is the fats/ salts/ and sugars that is destroying our bodies from the inside out!<br />Polar2[Eya-Andrea]

review/summary: Why would anyone buy these?
review/text: I bought these to try out based on good Amazon reviews which made them sound like some kind of wonder bars that were healthy and would make you happy for eternity (or something). I bought two flavors of these kind bars to try out. One was borderline gross the other decent. Here's the thing though: these are overpriced and not healthy. Let me explain:<br /><br />These are marketed for people are paranoid about what they eat. It's marketed to the same people who buy organic milk, produce and always look for things like "gluten free" etc. Most of this product is marketing and selling an image. I'm sure this is free of whatever they think at the moment might harm you. You might get the impression then from their advertisements that these are healthy. They're not. They may be gluten free but they're high in sugar and calories. Despite having so much sugar and carbs you can't even taste it. One of these bars is ~200 calories and is almost completely carbs (and some fat).<br /><br />In addition, if you calculate it out, it's more than a dollar per bar. You could buy the ingredients for these bars and put them together without the sugar and it would be much more tasty and healthy. Just save yourself the money and buy the ingredients.<br /><br />Bottom line: These are just overpriced, unhealthy (but not tasty) snack bars whose strongest selling point is the attractive packaging and feel good marketing. It's amazing how much they cost too. I'm guessing it's mostly in the packaging and marketing.

review/text: These bars are great and truly a 5 star product. Some of the nuttier varieties from Kind are a little hard on your teeth, no worries like that with these. Nice soft, chewy, tasty. Best fruit/nut or granola bar I've found. Downside, a little on the pricey side and a little high in saturated fat. But the perfect sweet "healthy" natural treat, and gluten free, a wonderful plus. You can really taste the mangoes and the macadamia nuts. A nice balance of both. These bars have calcium added but you cannot taste it, they just taste delicious.

review/summary: price v. value: five stars, even with the peanuts
review/text: UPDATE: The five stars are for the almond-walnut-macadamia bars, peanuts and all. I gave the cashew-almond-omega3 bars a try later and was somewhat disappointed with them. Not as much flavor. Back to almond-walnut-macadamia bars.<br /><br />I've gone through a few boxes of the KIND bars named for their alleged content of almonds, walnuts, and macadamias. I haven't encountered any of the funny tastes, apparent staleness, or wrappers horribly stuck to the bars, that some reviewers have mentioned. As other reviewers point out, there are a lot of peanuts relative to the content of walnuts, macadamias, and walnuts. But it tastes good nonetheless, and for the price ($1.06 per bar if you buy on subscription) it  strikes me as a good value. This is a relatively high-calorie snack bar (almost 200 cal), but it's also high protein (10g), has extremely little saturated fat, and a relatively low amount of sugar. It's substantial enough that you can easily resist eating a second bar. The bars also contain some worthy vitamins and minerals in amounts sufficient to matter. So far, knock wood, the deliveries on Amazon's subscription have been fast and the product has arrived in excellent condition. I don't expect to get a gourmet no-peanuts bar for this price--it's a good product and good value at this price.

review/summary: One of the best KIND varieties
review/text: Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow me to review the different KIND flavors individually, so I have to do them all in this review.<br /><br />I picked up a box of Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio and Cranberry Almond a few weeks back when Amazon was doing another one of their KIND promotions. Among the varieties of KIND bars I've tried over the last few months, the Pomegranate Blueberry Pistachio ones are easily my favorite in the whole line. They aren't overly sweet, and the variety of flavors in this version is excellent. While the pomegranate doesn't stand out much, the pistachio is definitely there as a nice subtle aftertaste.<br /><br />The Cranberry Almond, while still enjoyable, is a bit lower on my list - with nothing else to balance the flavors out, the cranberry flavor comes across a but too strong and tangy (though some might actually appreciate this).<br /><br />While I don't think these are meant to be more than snack/dessert bars (as opposed to meal replacements like with Clif of Powerbars), they certainly tide me over for at least an hour or two until I can eat a proper meal.

review/text: I have tried a number of the Kind bars at this point because I have basically fallen in love with their line of products. It started with a Cranberry Almond one from Starbucks and since then, I have started buying several boxes every month. I don't like dark chocolate very much but thought I would give the Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate bar a try this time around.  I'm glad I did! Delicious and not at all bitter like I expected. It will be the perfect late afternoon snack for those days that I am craving sugar and/or chocolate at work.  Overall though, I like the Cranberry Almond the best and repeatedly go back to it as a staple for those times I skipped breakfast, need a snack, I'm on the road, etc. The Madagascar Vanilla is very good as is the Pomegranate Blueberry. Not so thrilled with the Mango and Apricot versions.  I've shopped around locally and online and Amazon seems to be the best place to buy them in terms of price, especially if you put them on Subscription. Kind's line of Grains is also good... The Maple Walnut is perfect heated in the microwave like oatmeal.  Strong excellent flavor and loaded with healthy grains, nuts, etc. Overall, I have been very pleased with Kind and will continue to buy their products as long as they remain available.

review/text: This review is for the DARK CHOCOLATE CHERRY CASHEW flavor only....these are so good that I had to quit buying them so often because I would eat the whole box in 2 days! These are as good as candy bars. They DO NOT taste like any sort of "healthy" snack bar or anything. Now, some of the other flavors do and I think some of them are gross but this flavor is like eating a dang Chunky candy bar or something. Seriously, they are so good. They are really crumbly though so don't eat them in your jammies watching TV late at night (guilty!) or you will wake up covered in chocolate. :) But if you like nutty chocolate bars you will love these and you won't feel as guilty as if you were eating chocolate candy...but you won't be able to tell that you aren't!

review/summary: New and NOT Improved
review/text: I saw people here complaining that the formula changed, but it seemed the same to me. Then recently I bought one that tasted awful. I figured it was me - maybe I had a cold coming on or something changed my taste buds for the day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the good news is I can now find them at airports and everywhere. The bad news is that I've thrown away most of them half eaten as they almost taste "off" like they've gone bad. Very disappointed - I used to travel with 5 or 6 of these in my suitcase at all times. Hopefully they do something to revive their previous quality. Sometimes growth is painful.<br /><br />Someone post a review if they get better - until then I'm not buying any overly expensive and inedible bars. :(

review/summary: Break out the Beano/Peanut Bar w/Protein Powder Aftertaste
review/text: On the plus side they do fill you up & are packed with protein, filling & gluten free. On the downside - unless your idea of tasty is protein powder, I'd choose a handful of nuts versus this bar. Also you may want to consider Beano before eating these bars!!!<br /><br />LOVE the Almond Coconut KIND bars. Love the dark chocolate peanut butter ones, though more peanut than actual peanut butter. Taste somewhat similar to a healthy Baby Ruth. These Macadamia, Almond, Walnut bars have an initial odd protein powder aftertaste (though I don't think there's any in them). Once you keep eating it the initial taste goes away. I question why they would incorporate an odd taste when full of nuts that are protein packed. What's been added to make my tastebuds cringe at the unsavory taste? Peanut flavor outweighs the any flavor of other nuts once past the Protein Powder flavor. Barely a hint of macadamia nut flavor exists, though a promise of macadamia is what swayed me to order. All in all - would have been fantastic if able to elmininate the offputting protein powder taste. Wanted a tasty replacement for unhealthier counterparts. Unfortunately these failed to do the trick for me.<br /><br />A fan of the Almond & Coconut ones cause those have a great taste. These are off my list of future items to order.

review/summary: SO CHEWY GREAT FLAVORS
review/text: I heard about this bars on QVC thought I could get a better price on Amazon & I did.  These taste so good, I like that they are all natural, they are so chewy.  While I was eating one,they were so fresh that they started bending in my hand.  I gave them to some of my co-workers to taste & they already want to order some.  Wouldn't hesitate to buy if you like a chewy, great tasting bar if you want something less chewy try the blueberry, pomagranite pistachio.  I'll be ordering more

review/summary: All natural and all fun!
review/text: Kind bars are not only all natural but gluten free as well! They are a great tasting snack (can be a meal replacement), that are filling and available in a variety of flavors. And yes - these are made in the US of A. So, you don't have to worry about contamination.<br /><br />I have a personal preference against peanuts and unfortunately that limits your selection but there are still quite a few options. The Almond Cashew + Omega 3 is my favorite since it not only is all healthy nuts (no peanuts!) but also includes a vegetarian source of Omega 3 - flax seeds.<br /><br />Our four year old loves these bars as well and that makes these truly special (as part of what I can assure you is a very small list of healthy foods!) Amazon's price on these is the best!

I also carry one bar in my purse for low blood sugar when I'm away from home.

review/summary: Not as good as the almond coconut
review/text: I love the Kind Almond coconut bars so I decided to try the peanut butter dark chocolate.  It arrived in a box of 12 and all appear fresh.  The bars are both gooey and crunchy.  It is tastey but not as good as the almond coconut.  Very peanutty with a little but of nice dark chocolate.  I like that it is higher protein and that I get to feel like a I had a candy bar but without the crash of eating way too much sugar.  This bar is good but not my favorite

review/summary: The best KIND bars!
review/text: This is far and away my favorite of the KIND bars. They aren't sticky like some of them, and they don't just seem like another combination of almonds and fruit, like many of them seem to be. The peanut butter taste makes these really different from the others, and the drizzled dark chocolate is such a great addition. These are prone to becoming melty, though, so I keep them in my desk instead of a backpack or pocket. These are also hard to find in stores around me, so being able to get a box at a time is nice.

review/summary: The Best Gluten Free Bars!
review/text: I bought a box of the Mango Macadamia KIND bars from Amazon, since I had not seen that flavor at the stores.  They have a really delicious fresh fruity tropical sort of taste.  You can actually recognize what you are eating.  There are whole macadamia nuts in the bar.  They really do not taste like any other gluten-free bars that I have tried.  The KIND bars are so much better!  My absolute favorite is the Dark Chocolate Cherry Cashew!  I buy several of those every time that I go to Kroger or Whole Foods.  I highly recommend these snack bars!

review/summary: Dark Choc is the dominant flavor; lots of crunch and chewiness
review/text: While the bar does contain a lot of peanuts, the peanuts are not the dominant flavor and neither are the cherries. Each ingredient is noticeable, but in the same way that one instrument is noticeable in an orchestra--they all play well together. What I like most about this bar is the dark chocolate and the texture. The bar is satisfyingly chewy with crunch from the peanuts and macadamia nuts, etc.  I was leery of this bar because I don't like chocolate covered cherries and thought it might have that flavor, but the cherry isn't overpowering and the bar isn't sickeningly sweet. It comes across like a somewhat healthy but flavor-rich treat for adults, not a bland granola bar or a kid's candy bar. Just ordered more on subscription.

review/summary: Not as good as they used to be
review/text: Agree with previous reviewer -- these used to be fantastic, now just OK. Still my favorite energy bar, but as with others they have added cheap peanuts to most of the flavors. For those of us with peanut allergies, that's a real problem. I used to be able to eat most of the flavors, now there are just a few without peanuts. Last few months bars taste much more cardboardy than before -- they used to taste like fresh nuts & dried fruit.

review/text: I was looking for a low carb bar that tasted good and had a higher protein content. This KIND bar was perfect with 10g protein/bar and only 15g of carbs and it tastes absolutely delicious! I like the fact that it has a lot of nuts (which their good fats) which helps it break down slower and more evenly so that you don't get hungry as quick and your body gets to absorb the nutrients more evenly. I bought the high protein KIND bard with the dark chocolate as well but this Almond Walnut Macadamia one tastes better. I highly recommend it!

review/summary: Good for you, tasty, but gooey
review/text: I really like these KIND bars. They're tasty, they're light, and they're good for you.<br /><br />The bars I'm reviewing are Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio. They really don't taste like any of those, they taste like an almond bar with various bits of indistinguishable fruit bits. Here are the ingredients, with the titled ingredients in all caps: Almonds, blueberry pieces (BLUEBERRY, apple, and plum puree), raw sugar, glycerol, citrus fiber, cashews, honey, raisins, glucose, POMEGRANATE, crisp rice, chicory fiber, PISTACHIOS, soy lecithin, natural flavors. The ingredients are always listed in descending order of how much is included, and KIND pulled a fast one by calling their "blueberry pieces" a separate ingredient, since it's really just apple puree. By my math guesstimate, there is less than 5% of Pomegranate, Blueberry, and Pistachio in the whole bar.<br /><br />Basically, this tasted like an almond bar. My advice is to read the ingredients, and expect it to taste like what's in the ingredients, and not go by what the title is on these bars.<br /><br />They're also really gooey. These are probably the stickiest bars I've ever had. I never pick them up with my hands, but I eat them out of the plastic.<br /><br />Also, I've ordered about ten of these boxes off of Amazon, and one box was rock hard. Not this one, but another kind. So if your box is hard as a rock, then just order another one, and odds are it will be okay.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Good for you<br />+Lots of natural ingredients<br />+One bar is a good snack (not too sweet, not too small, just right)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The ingredients on the title of the bar misrepresent the actual ingredients<br />-Very gooey and sticky. You won't be able to touch them with your hands<br />-From my experience, 10% of the boxes have bars that are hard as rocks

review/text: I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.

Refrigerating before eating may help, but may also lead to tooth loss.  These are my thoughts!

review/text: Tasted these bars in a health food store and grabbed several flavors ot Kind bars to try.  The chocolate cherry cashew ones are like crack -- totally addicting!  Amazing blend of tastes makes me feel like I'm sneaking a candy bar instead of a healthy, wholesome friut and nut bar.  These are soft and chewy with with wonderful nuts throughout.  Major indulgence and healthy snack in one.  FAB product!

review/text: The dark chocolate cherry cashew kind plus bar combines everything I enjoy. The dark chocolate is not too sweet and the cashews add the right amount of crunch. Also I like the fact that it is gluten and dairy free. My children also like the bar. It is good to eat when you need to postpone a meal for a couple of hours.

review/summary: Reminds me of Christmas time when I was a girl. . .
review/text: I couldn't believe my luck. This little nut bar was included in my variety pack of these yummy Kind bars that I had ordered from Amazon last month. The taste and texture of this nut bar is the exact same taste as the beloved "no bake fruit cake" that my Nana made us when I was a little girl back in the 50s and 60s. It must be the dates and the particular kind of nuts because it tickles my taste buds in just such a way as to send me back years ago. I thank you Kind bar makers as being genius in your combinations of ingredients. I love these things... Love, love, love. I have just recently made an order with Amazon for a box of 12 of these things... and just when I remembered a book I wanted and decided to add that to my order... gosh, well, I goofed up and I hope that Amazon figures it out for me just in time because if I get all 24 of these nut bars I am in real trouble. I will eat them till they're gone. So, please, cross my fingers Amazon does their usual magic and gets my order just right! I have been invited to "Like" them on my Facebook page, but then I don't go there often and... well, if I tell everyone, then they may become hard to find in the future... sorta like telling everyone where your favorite fishing hole is and then not being able to go there because it's so crowded.<br /><br />Computers are so picky!  I offered to write a review of a different flavor of this Kind bar and it told me that only one review per product per customer... but I could edit my review! So, here I am. Back again to further praise and describe what has become my favorite snack food. They are so filling though, you have to watch it because it becomes a meal substitute and then your friends think you're no fun cause you won't eat with them! You're already full! The protein in these bars make them ideal for trail food, however, if you don't have the teeth for nuts, stay away. This last bar I decided I'd praise is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TNANSO">KIND PLUS, Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate + Protein, Gluten Free Bars (Pack of 12)</a>. I found them in my local grocery store but they often run out and that's what sent me to Amazon for a check on their availability. Yum! Lucky me! So, I'm out. I ate all I ordered last month and I'm daydreaming of them right now. Should've ordered them a week ago so I wouldn't be out now. These dark chocolate bars are so delicious I can conjure up the taste and sensation right now because. . . now here's the heaven part of this daydream. . .they taste like Baby Ruth candy bars from when I would a youth!  Yum, yum, yum.<br /><br />Gotta love it, guilt free candy! But, wait, everyone, it is NOT guilt free if you make it an extra snack, but instead make it part of your meal planning day. The nutrition and calorie info is printed on each bar and if you buy them in the carton, then the info is even easier to read.

review/summary: Horrible to deal with, bad warranty, unpleasant, many are hard to chew
review/text: We ordered a large sampler of most of their products and some other items from this company's brochure. The cover says "Harvest Fresh taste". So we thought it was like fresh fruit. It wasn't, and, being middle aged, we could not chew it, it stuck in our teeth, and most was drenched in sugar. We tried it all. No one wanted to eat any of it. We were dissatisfied. They also did not send a free item their brochure promises for purchases above 79 dollars.<br /><br />No fear, the second page says "100% guarantee. All our products are unconditionally guaranteed. If you or your gift recipient are not satisfied, please contact us for an immediate replacement or refund. It's important to us that you are happy with your order."<br /><br />So I did and asked for a refund. So far, not on your life. So far they have had roadblocks and stalling, like requests for data on the bottoms of tins, when most items, and there are a lot, are in  small cellophane packages in a large sampler with no tins. A mess and a time consuming, aggravating horror to deal with.<br /><br />Unless you are addicted to candied type fruits, many heavily sugared and tough and hard to chew, and cannot do without, keep away from this firm or find what you like elsewhere. Especially if your teeth are not the youngest. These people do not honor their guarantees and are really no fun to deal with. I emailed many times and called. Both ways were unpleasant. I probably will have to contact my credit card for help.

review/summary: Great Strawberry Tea
review/text: I am what you might call a tea snob...mostly I make lose leaf tea in my expensive temperature controlled air pot with a timer and in fine bone china...because I am that obsessive about preparing perfect tea.<br /><br />Sometimes though I will try a new "tea bag" style tea, usually the tea bag teas are much lower quality than that of lose leaf tea and taste terrible. Most of the time I am not impressed by these types of tea, but this time I was VERY surprised. The tea is very strong, the strawberry flavor is not a chemical tasting flavor, it tastes like real strawberry with a strong malty Assam black tea. In my opinion this is the result of perfectly blended tea, I don't like weak tea with weak flavor "notes" unless it is a complex white tea, this tea was strong, stands up to milk and plenty of sugar and still is the dominating flavor in your cup, a constant battle of the beautiful malty Assam and the sweet aroma and flavor of strawberries. I share a lot of teas with my friends that are top notch, some very expensive blends even, but this is the tea they ask for more often than not, lol. Which is good for me as it is so inexpensive and easy to make, you really can toss this in the microwave with a cup of water for 2 minutes!<br /><br />Give this one a try if you are looking for a strong flavored, strong black tea.

review/summary: Fash n Fresh products FANTASTIC!!
review/text: My daughter was diagnosed with a wheat, egg and peaunt allergy at 2 years old.  Trying to find wheat free foods that a my child liked was a Challenge to say the least!  We threw away so many products that she wouldn't touch.  I didn't blame her!! I tried them too and they WERE nasty!! The Fast n Fresh line was such a wonderful discovery!  I now had a quick alternative for my daughters diet.  She LOVES the bread.  She begs me to make it so she can lick the bowl.  I have made grilled cheese out of it.  It turns out okay.  Becareful, It burns quick!!  She also really likes the pizza crust.<br />I agree with the other post.  If your expecting a bread like consistancy, you will be disappointed.  The bread is similar in consistancy to a pancake.  I think it is rather tasty and I will munch on a piece myself.  I has a pancake like flavor to it.<br />There is a review on the hamburger buns that has a rant on the sugar content.  my opinon is that, there are so few products on the market for Wheat, egg, and gluten free, If they have to add sugar to make a good tasting product so be it.  My daughter doesn't get much candy or sugar in her diet and I would rather not deprive her of a bread or pizza crust.  Her diet is mostly protein and Fruit since those items are naturally gluten free.

review/text: We tried this product for our son who is 7 and gluten intolerant.  It really is quick and easy to prepare.  The servings are individually measured and comes with a measuring cup for adding water.  The bread results are not really a whole lot like traditional sandwich bread.  The single serve slices turned out with consistency more along the lines of a pancake and seemed a bit thicker than a regular slice of white bread.  With that said, they worked out just fine for making PB&J and my son had no complaints about the taste.  (I didn't try the bread myself so can't comment on the taste personally).<br />I recommend trying this out for yourself if you haven't found happiness with any other GF breads.

review/text: Although I prefer foods and treats with meat as the first ingredient, This Milk-Bone offering is like a guilty pleasure for my girls. There's beef in them thar treats, but listed sixth in the ingredients after brown sugar. On a positive note the ingredients are all natural with NO artificial preservatives No corn, and No artificial flavors.<br /><br />Our pampered pooches have small mouths, especially Piper the shih tzu, and for them these diminutive treats are sized perfectly. The little bits are a mix of soft and crunchy, but not too hard or crunchy. Trail Mix passed the taste test from the first offering and Piper can be quite fussy when given something new. With their small size and taste appeal, these make great rewards or training treats. The inclusion of SWEET POTATO forced this Potato Head to give this product a try.

review/text: Kids love them - treats - hide them for them to search - main thing they like  and that is what I was looking for - soft small manageable for small dogs.

review/summary: Kudos  to Milk Bone on this idea!
review/text: My sweet Mini Schanuzer, Willie, just loves this doggie trail mix.  I love the itty bitty pieces, which are easy to feed, and they are great to get Willie to do his trick routine.  If I shake the bag he comes running!  The best part is that they are all natural so I feel good about giving him this product.  A big thanks to Milk Bone, and Amazon for making these available.<br /><br />I normally pick this product up at Walmart, but it is not always available.  The price is the same in both places, so I will be purchasing from Amazon from now on.

review/summary: Fantastic training treats!!
review/text: My dogs and I are huge fans of this stuff! My senior loves it because the pieces are soft enough for him to chew, and the others just love the taste. My favorite thing is that this mix contains healthy ingredients AND comes in small pieces that make perfect training rewards. The mix has regular crunchy milk bones, a chewy version, dehydrated sweet potato, and bits of jerky. Nothing to feel guilty about giving your furball!!!

review/summary: Our (fat) little dogs love them!
review/text: We originally received a free sample from Milk Bone, and just had to find them...Amazon was the only place.  We have 3 pugs and they love, love, love these treats.  The orange sweet potato bites are the favorites, but all are enjoyed.  They won't even take a second glance at their Beggin' Strips anymore.

review/summary: A great variety!
review/text: I've sampled five of these teas and I am very happy with them!  The packaging was really nice, and the variety is great.  I tried the genmaicha this morning; this was a new experience and I'm so glad they included it.  Overall, this is a lovely array of different types of quality tea!

review/summary: Not Bad
review/text: I've been drinking loose leaf tea for several years now and I appreciate the variety of this sampler but this is not high quality tea. Many of the teas have the same underlying smokey taste when they shouldn't.  It will do in a pinch but I don't think experienced tea drinkers will be pleased.  I moved from a large city to a rural area so I decided to try a different product since I no longer have access to the quality loose leaf tea a large city offers. I will not purchase again.
