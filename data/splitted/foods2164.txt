review/summary: Great for Dogs with Allergies!
review/text: We have a bichon frise, who is allergic to corn, soy, wheat, oats, chicken, beef, and lamb.  We got her when she was six months old, and she already had horrible breath and excessive tartar on her teeth.  We had her teeth cleaned by the vet, who told us her teeth would probably be a lifelong problem.  We were told to brush her teeth daily, but we couldn't even find a canine toothpaste that did not contain ingredients from the above list (beef liver being most common).  We also tried various "hypo-allergenic" treats for her, but most are very expensive, and she didn't even like them.  About three years ago, we started giving her one of these every day, alternating between the Vitality and Happy Hips varieties.  She liked them immediately and still goes crazy every evening at treat time.  She had her annual dental cleaning last month, and the vet told us that her teeth are in great shape.  We consider her improved dental health to be a result of giving her these treats each day.  I would definitely recommend this to families with dogs who have allergies!

review/summary: Made in China but my dogs love them!
review/text: I am looking for other sweet potato treats that are made in USA. I would feel more comfortable.  Having said that, my many little toy dogs do love these, even two older ones who have lost their teeth.  They just suck on them until they are real soft then swallow the soft parts. The treats themselves are rigid, some are bendable. I add a little water to a bag to  soften them first and it works. I worry about my little guys choking on them but they haven't.  Sure beats those awful rawhide treats I use to give them. I quit when one of my dogs almost choked to death on one.You have to be careful, if you do add water to refrigerate these so they don't get bacteria build up. Sweet Potato chews are just the best idea ever. Why did it take so long? Too bad we can't depend on things from China, but that is just the way it is.

review/summary: crispy chicken?
review/text: Having purchased this dog treat (my dog's absolute favorite treat) in the store, I was surprised to find the mail-order version was different--the chicken wrapped around the sweet potato is much browner than any I have seen in a store. My dog still will eat it, but isn't as interested as he was with the less-cooked chicken version. I will say, though, that buying in quantity makes this treat a lot more affordable.

review/text: I contacted Amazon to let them know that my previous order of this product just didn't look right to me and two of my dogs were throwing up and had to go to the vet's.  They were fine until they ate this product.  It was very dark and dry and seemed old or just plain bad.  I threw them away.  Amazon replaced the order but unfortunately, it looked the same so it was wasted money for me.  I am really concerned about the safety of these dog treats that are made in China.  Buyer beware.

review/summary: Excellent quality of spices in a handy collection
review/text: I'm an avid cook and spice mix experimenter, plus I've been a fan of Chef Prudhomme's delicious recipes for some time.<br /><br />This is a world-class selection of spice mixes, and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family.  (Or yourself, if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup.)<br /><br />Although Prudhomme is a well-known Cajun chef, don't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out.  The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic.  It's a chile-powder kind of burn straight-on, but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner.  (Note to those who might try this at home: open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors, this is a smoky dish!)<br /><br />Other standouts are the Chicken Magic, which is a strong, herbal-scented spice, and the gentler, more complex Seafood Magic, which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it.  And you won't go wrong with the remainder of the items, which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MSG.

The first time I tried it was after a fishing trip in the Gulf of Mexico. I caught so much snapper that when I got back I started running out of ways to cook it. I was in my local grocery store one day looking at spices for something else when Chef Paul's blackened seasoning caught my eye. I figured I'd give it a shot and man am I glad I did. I've cooked a lot of fish in my days and nothing has ever come out tasting better than my blackened fish.

review/summary: Wonderful for Low-Carbers!
review/text: I ordered several Stevita products and this was one of them. I had read many reviews where people described stevia products as having a bitter or weird after taste.<br /><br />So when I got this product I added a litte bit at a time and tasted it as I went... I made a normal sized Kool-Aid or juice type decanter and added a full teaspoon (not heaping) of the powder. It has a very nice subtle sweet and fruity flavor. You could add more for a much more pronounced sweetness and flavor but I think thats what happens when people complain of a bitter after-taste... they add too much.<br /><br />The Stevita drink mixes were not meant to have the bold flavors and sweetness of say.. Kool-Aid or grape juice.<br /><br />These products are wonderful for those who are avoiding sugar, diabetics (check with your doctor first), low-carbing, artificial sweeteners and are tired of drinking water, water, water all the time ;)<br /><br />When you receive the container you will be surprised about the size... it is smaller than it looks online but remember a little goes a LONG WAY!

review/summary: No artificial colors or sweeteners = happy mommy
review/text: I have a very, very, very, very, very hyper 4-yr old. He is particularly sensitive to artificial colors. Many of the "kid" drinks on the market are filled with hideously vibrant artificial colors. I needed an alternative for him.  The flavor isn't quite the same and the sweetness of this drink isn't the same type of sugary sweetness you find in the typical kid punch type drinks, but that's actually a good thing.  This tastes more like real cherry. My son loves this drink mix. I use it at less than half strength so the jar lasts even longer. The fact that it doesn't have sugar or artificial sweeteners is a plus. My son doesn't get that sugar high.  I also love to add this to water (although my favorite flavor is the strawberry while his is the cherry). This is definitely as good for adults as it is for the kids.

Well, this is the ticket!  It's really good!  And way healthier than those other brands out there because this brand uses stevia instead of aspartame.  It's very sweet, so I recommend using less than the recommended amount.  Enjoy!

review/text: The first thing that I noticed is that the jar is LITTLE.  There are 13 servings per jar.  The fragrance is like a good old cherry kid's drink, and the flavor is pretty good.  All stevia products have some aftertaste (IMO), but this is pretty good- I drink it with a lot of ice, and that helps.  I'm not sure I'd drink it daily, but for a nice reprieve from plain water (I can't drink artificial sweeteners, so most sugar-free drinks are out), it's nice.  I like the TrueLemon products better, but for a plain cherry flavor, this is OK.<br /><br />EDIT- 7/22/2012<br /><br />The aftertaste is significant....probably will not reorder.  :(

review/text: I purchased this product as a substitute for Crystal Light, as my weight loss diet does not permit artificial sweeteners.  Had high hopes for the Stevita products, and while the flavors I purchased (cherry, orange, lime) taste great with no stevia aftertaste, I was surprised to find Xylitol as the #1 ingredient.  From what I've read, Xylitol is considered a suger alcohol, and many people on diets can have the same weight loss resistance issues as with artifical sweeteners.  I've only used the product for a week, so I'm curious to see if long term this will be a problem for me.<br /><br />Note:  Some of the listing for this product say that it includes Xylitol, but most of them do not provide an ingredient list.

review/text: I was really mad when I got this because the jar is tiny.  I mean really tiny and it says 14 servings on the jar.  There was no way this was worth the $7 I paid for it but it wasn't worth sending back.<br /><br />Grudgingly I opened it and sprinkled a little in my water.  I hate water so I need something to help.  This was suprisingly good.  I didn't measure just dumped a little in to take the water taste away.  I always drink with a straw so I had no problems with settling which I think it would do.<br /><br />I would get this again but it's way too expensive as others have noted.  I just saw some liquid stevia drops so I'm going to try them when I finish this.<br /><br />I have just a jar of stevia from Stevita and it was 1 lb and cost less than this although it has a bitter aftertaste.  I don't know why this is so expensive.  Give me more for my money please.

review/summary: good product, but pricy
review/text: I was dissapointed with this product's retail price.  While the bitter taste known to accomplany stevia was reduced in this product, I felt that there just wasn't enough powder to make it worth the cash compared to other non-aspartame based powdered drinks out on the market.  The usage directions are abysmal on the bottle, so I went with what most people stated here and started with a small quantity of powder.  I blended it very well using a blendy bottle, which is a 28oz bottle that contains a coiled circular spring inside that slices through the water, stirring with every shake.  While I can't comment on how well it tastes if you mix and let settle for long periods of time, I never had an issue with clumping or not having enough flavor.<br /><br />As for flavors, all I bought were pretty tasty.  I ordered cherry, orange, lemon-lime, strawberry, and grape all at once when there was a decent sale going.  this was in september 2009.<br /><br />Even though you don't need much powder to get a good taste, the company doesn't give any estimation as to how much you should use or how much a bottle makes.  With that in mind at the price its at, I find it hard to give this product more than 3 stars.  If it was four dollars I'd think it was a steal and easily give another star, as I estimate each jar will make upwards of 2-3 gallons, maybe more if used sparingly. at $9.95, sorry, I just can't.  I'm back to my old ways of using a touch of stevia from packets to sweeten my water and topping it off with whichever citrus fruits are on sale (a squeeze of lemon, lime, or orange for flavor).

review/summary: This Product Made Me Sick....
review/text: I have been on the HCG Diet and was looking for a way to make the 2 liters of water that I have to drink everyday better tasting. I've had this product along with the strawberry and orange flavor for 2 weeks now. I must say that the flavors are great tasting but the side effects of gas, bloating and diarrhea were awful. I couldn't figure out what may be causing this in my diet till I realized that the only thing I was doing different was the drink mix. When I stopped taking it the symptoms lingered for a few days till the product was out of my system. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

review/summary: FYI....Strawberries are not Organic
review/text: I don't know if Erewhon listened to customers complaining about not enough strawberries or maybe it was just a glitch in the production but all the boxes I've opened have plenty of strawberries in them.  I find the strawberry bits on the tart side as strawberries can sometimes be.  The flakes are delicious.  This cereal has 6gms of sugar so it's sweeter than Erewhon's crispy brown rice cereal with less than 1 gm of sugar but it's not too sweet.  Perfect alone or mixed with Crispy Brown Rice which is how I like to eat them.<br /><br />This cereal tastes so good don't think it's just for people with Celiac disease.  It's also a good option for those like myself with mild wheat allergies or maybe you're just looking for a healthy breakfast cereal.  For certain it's better than Rice Krispies which is made from white rice and high fructose corn syrup.  I called Kelloggs to ask where the rice comes from.  I was told, "we don't know".  They have no idea what the conditions are where the rice is grown?  Doesn't sound like they care either.  That concerned me which is why I started to look for an organic version.<br /><br />I didn't notice this until the boxes were delivered but the strawberries are NOT ORGANIC.  Only the cereal part is.  That's why the box isn't labeled as Organic the way their Crispy Brown Rice is.  On the box you will see a different type of label..."With Organic Grains".  That's where they make the distinction.

review/summary: Finally found a great gluten free cereal!!!
review/text: My favorite meal of the day is breakfast and I absolutely love cereal.  I was diagnosed with Celiac disease 5 years ago and have been a on a gluten free diet ever since.  If you are one of the lucky folks on a gluten free diet you know that your cereal choices are very limited.  Many of the gluten free cereals tend to taste quite a bit like cardboard.  I have tried pretty much every gluten free cereal out there and I have not been satisfied with any of them.  This is by far the BEST cereal I have had in years.  It fills the breakfast void and it is also an adult cereal which is nice because I always felt weird buying cereals with gorillas and koalas on the boxes :)

review/summary: Strawberries are NOT Organic...pesticides?
review/text: If you want true organic (pesticide free), then you'll need to look elsewhere.  The title and description (as of today) are deceiving; this product is NOT Organic, it is only made with SOME organic ingredients.  If you read the ingredients, the strawberries are NOT organic, however the title and description lead one to believe the product is organic.  Strawberries are at the top of the list of pesticide containing fruits, and it is a shame that a company that prints on their cereal boxes "Since 1966, Erewhon has led the organic revolution and we remain passionately committed to providing the purest organic foods...", would cheap out and put NON-organic strawberries in their cereal.  If you don't care about eating organic, then enjoy; the taste is okay.  I only tried a couple of flakes and they had a slight odd flavor, but I cannot comment on the strawberries' flavor as I could not bring myself to eat non-organic strawberries.  My husband said the cereal tasted okay, but Natures Path Corn Flakes and Mesa Sunrise flakes are much better.

review/summary: my baby's favorite formula
review/text: When switching from breast milk to formula, my baby suddenly went from a happy easy going baby to a fussy constipated baby.  I tried almost every milk-based formula available at the grocery stores (with no success) before trying this one.  This one gave me my happy baby back, no more constipation.  It is labeled "low" iron, which means that it is fortified with about half as much iron as the excessive amount found in other formulas.  I found that I could mix this up to about half-and-half with other formulas before the constipation set in again.  I don't understand why this formula is not available through the stores; however, I found ordering it by the case through Amazon to be really convenient, with free fast delivery, and price slightly less per ounce than most of the formulas at the grocery store.

review/text: I wish I could give this 10 stars!  After I stopped breastfeeding my sweet happy baby became a screaming unhappy baby.  His poo became so pasty that he would scream and turn blood red in the face from trying to poop.  The doctor told me to try prune, apple, or pear juice to "help it along".  After a few days of giving him that every day he went back to screaming baby again.  Things were so bad that he gave himself a hemorrhoid before he was even 5 months old!  I tried EVERY formula that the stores sold and there was never any change.  A friend of mine told me about high iron concentrations causing constipation in one of her friends babies and maybe I might look into that.  After looking through every store in the towns around me I started searching online to see if this even existed.  Luckily I found this on Amazon!!  I started giving this to my baby a few weeks ago and the change is AMAZING!  I have my sweet baby back!!  The poo has gotten back to normal and this formula has made a WORLD of difference!!!  If your baby is constipated or having issues having a bowel movement you should really try this!!!  Really wish the typical stores carried this but Amazon is easy to order through and I have not had any issues and I have now ordered my 3rd case!

review/text: A couple of weeks ago I had to bring my then seven month old to the dentist because his only two teeth were turning black on the underside.  Turns out it was iron build up.  I have high iron and so apparently does my son.  I immediately logged online to find a low iron formula and much to my chagrin almost all baby foods and formulas are fortified with extra iron.  This was one of my very few options but luckily it turns out my son loves it!  We've had no problems since switching to this formula.

review/summary: OK; not as good as McCann's
review/text: I am a big fan of hearty oatmeal.  I use Quaker oats for baking, but for a winter's breakfast, I want substance and flavor.  I've been eating and loving McCann's Irish Oatmeal for years.  I have tried and liked, but not loved, other steel-cut oats such as those from Bob's Red Mill, but I wondered if McCann's was the best, so I added this to an order I was already making.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra shipping for it.  This was disappointing.  The oatmeal is blander in flavor and mushier in texture than steel-cut oats.  If you like a softer, more traditional oatmeal, you might like it.  The packaging is frustrating, with the liquid-to-oat ratio given in volume of water to weight of oats rather than a dry measure.  This product is labeled for the U.K. market in which every kitchen has a scale, apparently, so you are on your own to figure out the best water-oats ratio.  It cooks quickly, so it may be similar to McCann's quicker-cooking oats (in the box; I've never tried those).  This bag is not resealable, so you will need a separate container or self-sealing bag to store it.  Several months later, most of my package is in my freezer and I'll probably end up tossing it.  If you are interested, this package weighs 1 kg and here is a price comparison:  Alford Organic Pinhead Oatmeal $7.99/35.27 oz. = $0.227 per oz.  vs. McCann's Irish Oatmeal (in package of 4 handy cans) $25.07/112 oz. = $0.223/oz + free shipping.

The Oatmeal of Alford's Organic Pinhead Oats are almost as good. They cook way faster than McCann's and have more flavour and a better bite. I would recommend these oats if you like Haemlyn's and can't find it. I also like that the Alford's Oats are organic. I add flaxseed meal and nuts and berries and it's quite a delicious nutritious breakfast. I don't feel hungry until lunch and I've got plenty of energy.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q0ISDU">Organic Pinhead Oatmeal of Alford Stonecut Oatmeal by ChefShop.com</a>

review/summary: Precooked was not the way to go...
review/text: I really wanted to love this item. I have ordered from Burgers before. Their precooked smoked turkey is excellent. But I did not enjoy this prime rib. Why? I bought the 4-5 lb roast for Christmas dinner. I let it thaw in the refrigerator for 4 days and then set it on the counter for two hours to bring it up to room temperature so it would reheat evenly. I followed the instructions that came with the roast, preheated the oven and let it cook for about an hour at 350 degrees. As I was busy preparing the rest of the meal I felt confident the prime rib would turn out fine since it was already cooked. As I was finishing up the rest of the cooking in that last dash of chaos to get everything out on time I finally checked the temperature of the meat and was shocked to find it was only 80 degrees in the center!<br /><br />I know for a fact the entire prime rib was thawed so there is no way it was still cold in the middle before I put it in the oven. I didn't panic. Since my guests were waiting and everything else was finished I had to get this meat up to temperature quickly (to at least warm) in the center without ruining the perfect red color of medium rare. Unfortunately that meant putting this beautiful and EXPENSIVE piece of meat in the microwave. I had to run it on high for 1 minute intervals, constantly opening and closing the door until I got the center to 110 or so - at least so my guests thought it was warmed through. Because of how big the roast was, that process took about 10 extra minutes. Obviously it is impossible to cook a prime rib evenly in the microwave so I ended up with overcooked ends, well done second and third slices and a slightly pink center.<br /><br />As for the taste...what were they thinking? I tasted like it was injected with highly concentrated au jus. Each bite was too salty for my taste and there was a heavy flavor of beef broth and rosemary. I wanted to taste the beef, not the seasonings. It reminded me a little of carved roast beef you get in a cheaper chain buffet restaurant or cafeteria like Golden Corral.<br /><br />Are there any positives? Yes, I can't say I hated it outright. The meat itself was tender as a prime rib should be and the flavor while a bit overpowering, was edible. In fact, my in-laws said they liked it a lot (but maybe they were just being nice). Also, it was much bigger than I thought - that's a good thing. It easily fed 6 people and there was enough left for another 5 or 6 more slices.<br /><br />But for the $115 I paid I probably could have had the same results from my grocery store meat case. Sorry Burgers. I like your products but you blew it on this one. I won't be buying a precooked prime rib from you again.

Saffron is one important piece of the final product.<br /><br />Wasn't it Donovan who once sang that he was "wild about Saffron"? Well, when I cook risotto, so am I!

review/summary: Too pricey here for what you're getting.
review/text: The product itself is really good and I'll review that in a moment. First, I want to say that the price not worth its expense. I ended up deducting two stars for the serious price gouge. If the price were better, they would have gotten 5 stars and pay attention carefully. I have posted the prices I see today, so if they change then take that into consideration.<br /><br />PRICE COMPARISON<br /><br />I bought the Walmart brand three days ago and using my receipt, I'm going to compare it with today's Amazon price:<br /><br />Walmart Great Value Brand (16 oz.) container<br />$1.98 each/$23.76 for 12<br /><br />Amazon's Coffee Mate (16 oz) container at the 15% off subscription price<br />$2.85 each/$34.25 for 12<br /><br />Again, this is even using the subscription price and not Amazon's actual retail price. That is a significant price difference.<br /><br />No thanks!<br /><br />COFFEE MATE REVIEW<br /><br />Is Coffee Mate better than a store brand? A little bit, but not by that much. There is a slight difference in quality but it is so slight that it just is not worth the price difference. It is definitely tasty though. On that subject, the fat free type is much less creamy than the regular. That alone is a serious change. I easily got used to it though. My heart thanks me for it. ;)<br /><br />POWDERED VS REFRIGERATED<br /><br />There are benefits for using powdered over refrigerated creamer. The primary reasons I choose powdered are:<br /><br />* Keeping coffee hot. Refrigerator cools it too much for my liking.<br />* Better shelf life. I don't use much, so in my home the refrigerated kind gets wasted and goes bad, before I can use it.<br />* Price. Powdered is always cheaper than refrigerated.<br /><br />There is really only one con to buying powdered over refrigerated and that being there is no nutritional value to it. I don't care about that part though because I am a heavy milk drinker. I still get my daily dairy nutrition.<br /><br />Overall, I would not recommend this due to its price. If you don't mind the pricing, then the product is comparable to all others so there is no reason not to buy it.

review/summary: Fat-Free? Right!
review/text: For those on a low-fat/no-fat diet, watch out!  The second ingredient for this product is vegetable oil!  So you are getting fat when you use this "fat-free" product.  They claim a "trivial" amount for one teaspoon, but most people use more than a single teaspoon.  The taste is fine, but don't call something "fat-free" when its second ingredient by weight is oil!

review/text: This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of anything online.  I'll submit the same to French's as well.  It is disappointing that they have ruined a Holiday staple for the sake of saving money.  I hope their sales declines and forces the return of the original packaging.  The new plastic containers add a strong chemical or plastic taste.  It seems to burn off during cooking but those of us that love to eat straight from the container are left with a horrible after taste.  I also can't help but to feel like the product is poisoning us some how...if I can taste the chemical then it surely is going into my body.  I just hope it's not being absorbed.  Please bring back the original container.

review/text: In all the advertisements I've seen for the new canister, French's claims this packaging will help the product stay fresh.  I suppose that might be possible, IF they were fresh in the first place.  When I opened the can and tried one, they were already stale - no crunch to them.  I don't know if it's a problem with the way their seal binds to the plastic or what, but it isn't working.  I won't buy this container again.  I hope they don't phase out the old ones!

review/text: The new canister idea went a little too far, as there is also some thing different with the taste. They dont even taste like onion any more, very bland. Not the same French's that we have grown to know and love over the years. This is a true shame. Hopefully, some one will realize that and do some thing about it. If it isn't broken, don't fix it! Bring back the old caniser with the real original flavor please, my taste buds beg of you!! Thanksgiving this year will not be the same......:(

We thought it might be just Matty being fussy about the taste, but then I tried the product and I'll never do that again.  We all agreed, starting with my 2 year old grandaughter, that this candy is the very worse tasting candy any of us have ever had. I'm planning on returning the entire box. Do yourself a big favor and do not buy this product. There were no reviews when I purchased this candy, now I know why.

review/text: I call it the "4 P's of Vegetarianism" (Protein Price Per Pound) and if you have to mail order most of your veg protein products like I do, the Linketts 6 lb can is about the best it gets short of making your own.  If you order this through Amazon's Subscribe and Save program, it's an even better deal.  I have done the research, having been a vegetarian living in remote "veg head un-friendly" towns for most of my adult life.  Tip: open and drain these links and package well in freezer bags and they freeze up nicely.

review/text: The delivery of the product was quick and free.  The product came bubble wrapped, very securely, for shipment.  The product was of the same quality as the smaller 20 oz. sold in the stores, but don't expect 96 oz. to be 5 times or 50 Linketts.  It is packed with extra liquid, so there are only 40 Linketts, equivalent to 4 cans purchased in a store or market.  The price is still very good.  The taste of the Linkett is not as good as the Big Frank, which I originally wanted to order, but it was out of stock.

review/summary: The skinny one
review/text: The ABC book and foodstore nearby temporarily closed but My Dear AMAZON has always been prompt and reliable w/ my orders.THANK YOU ,AMAZON... Linketts is good but I prefer tasty LomaLinda Big Franks for fried/grilled hotdog in a bun with bbq sauce mix w/ ketchup. I use linketts BEST for Oriental stir fry because it is skinny and not as flavorful. When cooking, the sauce in the recipe will give it more taste esp.when sauteed w/ fresh ginger, red pepper, grape tomatoes with Concord Foods Stir Fry Mix Asian Style(comes in a packet).For church potlock I use the 96 oz. can Linkett(cut linkett in 2) and lightly stir mix w/ the above mentioned spices then mix in the half steamed veggies...lots of broccoli,some cauliflower,few carrots for color, and snap peas(do not steam- only add to the mixture because they taste good crunchy).WITH ALL OF THESE in the pot together,just LIGHTLY STIR for ABOUT 5 MIN. Now, don't make it too greasy nor watery.Only serve it occassionally because it is processed foods and seasoning mix has some preservatives and sugar. ENJOY !!!

review/summary: My favorite since childhood
review/text: I love Linketts, they have been a favorite since I was a kid. If you weren't raised eating them you might not like them but if you like trying new things and like other vegetarian foods you should try these. I use them just as meat eaters use regular hot dogs. They taste great fried with Worthington chili. You can also be creative with these and come up with some great recipes. One of my favorites uses brown rice, olive oil, onion powder, stewed tomatoes, canned black beans, and sliced Linketts and then putting it in tortillas. It is one of the greatest recipes ever just don't leave out any of the ingredients I once forgot to add the black beans and it wasn't even close to as amazing.<br /><br />Also since the Linketts are not meat based it not a problem to eat them straight from the can but DO NOT judge the taste based on that alone because they taste completely different when they are fried or grilled. Also I think most people would only like them fried or grilled especially people who are or were meat eaters.

review/summary: Definitely made for hors d'oeuvres
review/text: These crackers aren't meant to eat naked; they are too dry and aren't salted.  They are sturdy and rather thick, which is exactly what you need in an hors d'oeuvre cracker.  The rosemary taste is subtle, but still comes through with other toppings.  None of the crackers broke while I smeared stiff, cold, un-whipped cream cheese on the top, although a few were already broken in the box.  I prepared mine with a basil cream cheese and smoked salmon; I received rave reviews from my friends.  With 2 grams of protein in 3 crackers, they are quite filling.  Try some at your next gathering!

review/summary: Addictive!
review/text: Being a baker, I really don't like many prepackaged cookies with the exception of Nutter Butters and now these.  The cookie is delightful--deliciously smooth maple cream sandwiched between slightly sweet (with a hint of salt) wheat cookies. And they're pretty too! I could seriously eat the entire box in a day....which is why I only buy them one box at a time!

review/summary: YUM!
review/text: Do not buy these if you don't like the taste of maple.  Open the bag and the scent of maple wafts through the air.  The leaf shaped cookies are crisp, the cream filling moist, but more importantly, all are flavored with maple. Not scented,  flavored, it comes through and melts on your tongue in a most delicious experience.  You only need one or two to satisfy your sweet tooth.

review/text: I may be biased, being a relocated Canadian, but these cookies are wonderful.  They are always moist and flavourful, but not too sweet.  I highly recommend them!

review/summary: Peanut free; Tree nut free; DELICOUS
review/text: The DARE line of cookies that I have found so far are DELICOUS!  I have a child who is anaphylactic to peanuts, tree nuts, sesasme and shellfish.  These cookies are a GIFT!  I don't always have time to bake with a very busy household.  I learned of these Canadian cookies and decided to try them.  I purchased one bag at the supermarket before investing in a package of 12 Maple flavor from Amazon.  We all love them!  I wish there was a variety pack that I could purchase as they have many other flavors; lemon, fudge, coconut, cinamon.  DARE also has a brand called Bear Paws which are pre-packed in pairs and are great for the kids' lunches.  We also use the Bear Paws to make icecream sandwiches.  I wish Amazon carried DARE's Bear Paws.  Please always read the label if you live with food allergies!  These are a winner!
