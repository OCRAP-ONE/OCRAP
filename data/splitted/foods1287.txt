review/text: This is just to let you know there is another listing on Amazon for a 4 pack of these 1-pounders for only a few bucks more!  Much better value if you can put it to good use!<br /><br />Update: Just received my 4-pack, and baked some bread.  I am very happy with the results.  Good yeast!  I put it in a ziplock bag, and am refrigerating it so I can get more use out of it.  The bags are vacuum-packed, so they should stay fresh until they are opened (though the package has a "best if used by" for 2 years after the manufacture date).  I ordered this in March, and it was manufactured/produced in November, so it is pretty fresh.

review/text: SAF Yeast is great. I only gave it 4 stars to draw attention to how I ended up massively overpaying for it. I do recommend dividing it up into 2 or 4 oz. portions and vacuum packing and freezing them. They will remain active and you can use all of the product.<br />I have found it for sale at the Anderson's Chain in Ohio for $5/lb. I had forgotten they sold it.<br />I got burned when I didn't carefully track the amount of "eligible" Amazon free shipping items, and got hit with a $8 shipping charge. At least we all know how Amazon pays for the "free shipping," yes?<br />Live and learn.

review/summary: Does it rise!
review/text: We made 5 loaves of white bread the first week it arrived using a recipe from Julia Child.  It was the most wonderful bread ever.  However, I noticed that this yeast worked better than any of the yeast we bought in stores.  It started bubbling in minutes.  It doubled the loaf size in 45 minutes on the first rise and an hour on the second.<br /><br />We stored it in the fridge with paper around the outside of the jar.  We used it again about a week later.  Again the yeast bubbled in minutes.  However, it didn't rise as much because we used a different recipe that called for 1/4 of the original.  It still rose in an hour.  We are going back to the Julian Child recipe.  You can't get a better bargain for yeast that work twice as hard to make your bread for you.

review/summary: simply the best
review/text: I discovered this brand of yeast a few years back when troubleshooting issues with my first bread machine; I found that not only did it solve the problems of less than perfect results from the machine but it improved the results with my hand kneaded loaves as well. I bake in smaller quantities for a single person and only a few times a week so this size was more than I could use but still more economical than the smaller packages. I store it in the coldest part of my refrigerator in an airtight container. At the two year mark it was still "active" and producing good loaves, but I'd rather not discover the hard way when it is truly past its peak so I've purchased it again. Excellent results every time!

review/summary: My Little Girl is Heartbroken!
review/text: I bought Saf-Yeast Instant Yeast to be pets because I wanted to replace my daughter's hamster that had unfortunately passed away last Christmas when it crawled into the nativity scene and got stuck between the folds of a wiseman's tunic. Yeah. Holy Night indeed. Try calming down a seven year-old when her older brother mistook the hamster for a camel and started a play-fight between the "camel" and one of the sheep. Anyways, I misread the brand as Safe when it's Saf-Yeast. I thought the yeast would live longer than those annoying Sea Monkeys. Not. As another reviewer noted, my batch, too, tested DEAD! My daughter went into another tailspin while her brother mocked the baker on the package by pretending he was the baker killing the yeast as he put them in the mixing bowl. It took promising my little girl a bearded dragon for her birthday and grounding my son for a week before she finally quit crying. If you want household chaos and bread that won't rise, you'll take your chances on this yeast.

review/text: These seeds turn puffy and expand when they soak in water. Then, they can be added to drinks for texture. They have a very slight licorice flavor. The notable experience using these seeds is that they add texture to drinks. Some traditional Indian drinks use them. I have, however, used them in cold teas, juices, and other mixtures. It is said that they can cool the core temperature of the body. I have not experienced this.

review/summary: As a kitchen trash bag you MUST commit
review/text: As I am attempting to "green" up my lifestyle, I originally bought these to use for used cat litter and dirty diapers, but ended up replacing my seventh gen kitchen trash bags (temporarily) with these neat biodegradable bags.  I love the idea of them breaking down, allowing my trash a chance to biodegrade faster.<br /><br />  These are a "whisper of a trash bag" and I had the most challenging task of using these during the prime summer months (Jun-Aug).  My trash is picked up once a week (like most people's), and I experimented with these by emptying my cat's litter box (we use feline pine) in a bio bag.  The litter had to sit 5 days before pick up, and I even kept the bag in a cool place.  Wrong.  The bag broke down and I had the unfortunate task of double bagging (that's where these bags would become outrageously unaffordable).  Next, I changed my cat box changing schedule so that I would empty it on trash day (this experiment was in July).  Still no good.  My trash collectors come in the mid afternoon and the bag didn't make it through the hot humid day.  From my experiments (at least in the summer months), I could not use these bags individually for feline pine cat litter.<br /><br />  Next, I used these bags for my diaper pail (still summer).  I only have one toddler (almost 2) in diapers, and I found that the bag is fine if it is used for diapers (no wipes in the pail) and taken out weekly (which gets only halfway full in 7 days), but if I waited until I filled my diaper pail (which takes about 2 weeks), too much moisture got built up in the pail and the bag dissolved. Most people don't want stinky diapers kicking it in the house for 2 weeks, but it's unfortunate to use these expensive bags to half capacity, so either way, you lose.<br /><br />  Finally, I found a use for these bags, and that was as my main kitchen bag; but, you have to make significant changes in the way you throw out trash.  First off, I read up on these bags, and a previous reviewer stated that if you put your wet trash in, say, an empty bread bag you were going to discard anyway, that these bags will work.  I had saved a bunch of these kinds of bags for my cat's litter, so that's how I made these bio bags work.  I'd line my can with the bio bag, and on top of the closed can, I'd have an old bagel bag or deli lunch meat ziplock as my wet trash reserve, and if I came up on wet trash I'd put it in that bag, then once that filled up I put the bag of wet trash in the bio bag.  As long as the trash didn't get too heavy (or wet), my biobags would make it through a week.  If you put wet trash (kitchen scraps, baby wipes, etc) in a biobag, you're doomed.<br /><br />  From my experience using the biobags, they really make you cognizant of how you throw things away.  Sure, it seems pointless to put your trash in a bunch of basically plastic bags to put it in another bag, but at least you are taking one layer of plastic out of the equation.  Every plastic bag I used to hold wet trash was going to be in my trash, anyway.  You'd be surprised how many odd plastic bags you throw away (bread bags, empty chip bags, empty cereal bags, etc).  It also showed me just how much wet, compostable garbage I make (kitchen scraps), and it proved to me how I really make enough fruit and veggie scraps for composting.  But on the other hand, biobags turned me into a total neurotic over my trash can, as I played trash police with my family and friends.  If you can get everyone around you to get with the "system," these bags will work for you.  For me, honestly, it wasn't worth all the trouble.  I am still sticking with my seventh generation trash bags. :(

They don't fit in an average kitchen garbage bin and they also tear extremely easily. If you are using them strictly as compost bags and only putting scraps in them I'm sure they'd do fine, but they shouldn't be used for an average kitchen garbage bag.<br />Also, it only contains 12 bags. Add the price of shipping and this becomes very expensive for a bag only to be used in a compost pile.

review/summary: Far better than plastic
review/text: No, these are not indestructible hefty hefty hefty bags...yes they are thin, yes moisture builds up in your trash can if you let them sit full of food for more than a week - that's what makes them biodegradable folks!  With a little care in removal and disposal, and changing the bag every 5-7 days, these do the job perfectly (put most of your food waste in the compost and these can sit for even longer without too much moisture build up to weaken the bag).  If you want a steel toed, tear-proof bag, well it's going to sit in the landfill for the next thousand years. If you want something that will biodegrade and significantly reduce your eco-footprint, these are the real deal. Put a little effort into your "green" rather than complaining that these don't take out the trash and do the dishes on their own. Our planet goes to way more trouble taking care of us, so let's return the favor.

review/text: I have been using canvas grocery bags for a few years now, and it bothered me to still use standard plastic trash bags. These are great, though they aren't terribly strong. I find that the more recycyling and composting I do, the less trash I have anyway, though. My husband and I end up with about one bag of trash per 2 weeks. By the end of the 2 weeks, these bags are starting to weaken and you want to be careful when taking them out. Otherwise, it's worth it, knowing we're not adding more plastic to the landfills. Every little bit helps.

review/text: I have read other comments from good to bad and have to say, I'm cornfused as to the lament the other people may have with this product. I have been using these bags for almost a year and have yet to have a problem with them. They are sturdy enough for the trash we put in it. We recycle as much as possible, and no, you cannot pound the trash into these bags. If your expecting hefty hefty hefty, well then maybe your at the wrong place or you need to start recycling more. We mostly put kitchen trash and light un-recyclable stuff in to them, but they work and yes maybe they're a little more expensive but I feel better about my part in this throw away society. They have worked better than I anticipated and just placed another order for more.

review/summary: New, Improved
review/text: These bags were re-done at some point - Maybe 6-12 months ago.  Anyway, we used to have problems with them starting to compost in our garbage can (located under a heater vent of all places) but now they hold up well for the week it takes our family of five to fill one of these.  They are also a bit larger than they used to be which has meant they fit into our can better.  I might add that we don't put any wet waste into our kitchen garbage as that all goes to our chickens or in our separate compost container which is dumped more often.

review/summary: Good idea, but clammy !
review/text: I try to do my best with sustainable products and recycling, so bought these bags.  I love the idea of them, but after just a few days the garbage stinks, the bag turns wet and clammy and they are extremely thin and have ripped from just tossing a stalk of broccoli in the bag.  Sometimes I actually double bag these in my garbage can so they don't tear, but they're already pretty expensive so I'm basically paying twice as much.  Not sure if I'm going to continue with these bags - wish there was another biodegradable alternative....

review/text: i love biobags, and use the doggie bags religiously. however, the kitchen bags don't hold up to being stuffed or overstuffed. they stick, rip, leak, and have only worked for me (i use a simplehuman butterfly step can) when i double-bag. like the other reviewed said, they would work great if you are just putting compost in, or in my case i use it to line my bedroom trash and that works great. they can't be filled to the max with heavy trash.

review/summary: Not very strong
review/text: I had been using another type of eco friendly garbage bag, but they seem to be unavailable from all sources, so I ordered these instead.  They are not very strong.  They don't have handles, so they don't stay in place very well.  With the other brand of bags we were able to take out three full liners from the kitchen cans at a time.  With bio bags we are lucky to make it to the herbie with one...they need to be gently removed and then held on the top and from the bottom and walk fast and hope they don't leak.  These are less expensive than the previous brand used, but are definitely an inferior product.  I think I'll keep looking for a better eco option.

review/summary: Only Compostable Option
review/text: This seems to be the only option for readily available compostable tall kitchen bags.  Other similar bags listed here are biodegradable, but not compostable.  So, this appears to be the only legal option for residents of San Francisco, California.  The other bags contain plastic, these don't.<br /><br />That said, they are pretty good bags.  Sure, they are thin, and can get clammy when wet.  But, I've not yet had one break.  They only need to make it from the can to the curb, so that's not much to ask.  I just noticed that they claim to have been recently redesigned.  The size is also a bit different (they are now a bit taller and skinnier).  And, they come in a smaller box.  I haven't tried these new bags yet.<br /><br />My only complaint was that they were made in Norway, so they have to be shipped quite a distance.  How good for the environment can that be?  The new bags don't list a production country on the outside of the package.  Are they now made in the USA?

review/summary: Trash Doesn't Smell as Much
review/text: Looking for a kitchen trash bag that was biodegradeable, I just randomly selected these at Whole Foods one day and I can't be more pleased with my choice.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Biodegrable - obviously the main reason for buying these bags.  Reduces the amount of plastic that goes into the landfill.<br />2) Less Trash Odor (!)- This was completely a suprise benefit but my trash has actually barely smelled at all since I've started using these bags. When reading their website, apparently due to the "breathability" of the bags, which prevents odor build up. Whatever it is, its been great to open the trash can and not have to recoil at the disgusting smell, even when the trash can is almost full.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) No tie handles - Its a little harder to close these since I need to twist and tie a knot. Only minor inconvience though.<br />2) Flimsier than regular trash bags - this is obviously the biggest drawback since they are more likely to tear and probably an issue with any biodegradable bag.  However, I've gone through about 10 bags now without any tearing or any issues.  They recently strengthened the bottom of the bags to reduce tearing so it might have been more a problem before. Obviously you need to be a little cautious about what you throw away and not stuff a lot of sharp objects in your trash can like broken glass - these aren't the force flex bags. Overall, I've pretty much been throwing away the sames things as before with no issue.  Note: I have a smaller trash can that the 13 gallon bags fits well - I haven't tried using the 25 gallon bags so I can't say if they have any tearing problems.<br /><br />Overall, I'm extremely happy -  the pros defintely outweigh the cons.  Yes, you need to be a little careful what you throw in these bags but being green as well as the less trash odor makes these bags well worth it.

review/summary: Worst Bags Ever Made
review/text: Unlike the many high quality compostable products available today, Biobags are junk who's manufacturer clearly expects to be able to sell poor quality, almost unusable merchandise just because it is compostable. These bags are thin and fragile. You either have to double bag or put up with leaks. Even if you do double bag, you need an undersized trash can because these are not as big as a standard trash bag. Compostable bags should be made larger than conventional bags to allow tieing them off since you can't use twist ties, but these are actually 2" smaller than ordinary cheap trash bags!<br /><br />I'm committed to composting, so I'm still using these until I can find a quality alternative. I hope to try the Ecosafe bags soon, but so far have only seen them in the 3 gallon size.

review/summary: Reduce Non-Biodegradable Plastic
review/text: Great alternative to non-biodegradable plastic trash bags.  What we do is put one of these corn-based plastic trash bags inside a thicker recycled plastic trash bag (made from petroleum products) and throw away only the "green" bag when it's full.  Much kinder to the earth - and the heavier-weight outer bag supports the inner bag!  We also use a separate trash can for any non-stinky, dry trash - we keep this in our pantry - no need to throw away this plastic liner or clean this trash can very often.  This way you don't fill up your more expensive green bag (about $0.37 each) very quickly.  This method has worked awesome for at least a year.

They fit the can perfectly and actually stay in place unlike my old drawstring bags. I have chosen to amend my stuff everything you can fit into the bag philosophy and so far (1 box used) have had no breaks or leaks. I am surrounded by the ocean and I rarely forget that we are literally trashing our oceans daily. It feels good knowing I can do one less harmful thing and is certainly worth the change.

review/text: Expensive for how many you get, but its worth the price knowing I am not adding more to the trash heap.  Ironically, on the box it says its thicker and bigger, but I found it to be just a tad too small for easy use as a 13 gallon bag.  After applying it to the trash can, the first 4 or 5 things you put in pull the whole bag down with them.  So I am in the habit now when I have a new bag to gently place the first few objects in the bottom and be prepared to reset the bag anyway.  If the bag were about 4 inches longer I would give this 5 stars.

Do not let sharp edges touch directly to the bag.<br />And also somebody else wrote on the review, I think this bag is slightly smaller than the average tall kitchen bag. I snag this bag over my kitchen trash can and it comes off from the edge whenever I throw in something heavy. If manufacturer can make this bag a little bit bigger, at least as big as average tall kitchen bag size, I'll give 4 stars to this product.

review/summary: Not Tall Enough for Tall Kitchen Cans
review/text: These bags, in contrast to their description, are NOT tall. In my standard kitchen trash can, they only reach about three quarters the way down. Combined with the thin walls of the bags, this means that if you try to compress the trash even slightly you simply rip the bag. Likewise, if you put anything with any weight in the trash, the bag simply stretches and rips.<br /><br />Biodegradability is a wonderful idea, and if these bags were about one third again as long as their current length, they would be functional. With a little more tensile strength(in addition to the added length), they would be even better (thicker walls or stronger plastic). As it is, at this length they are barely usable.

review/summary: Don't waste your money.
review/text: I started composting this year and have been searching for several months for a bag that is compostable but sturdy at the same time.  This bag is definitely NOT what I have been looking for.  This bag begins to break down in the trash can as soon as it gets any moisture on it.  I was using it for all my food waste, and since most food is at least somewhat moist, it would get wet as soon as I put any kind of food in it and the trash can would get dirty and gross.  I only used three of the bags before I got sick of cleaning out my trash can every time I changed the bag.  It completely defeats the purpose of a trash liner if you have to clean yucky stuff out of your trash can between bag changes.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.

review/text: We love these!  We are weeding regular plastic out of our lives as much as humanly possible and these really fit he bill.  Only issue we have is if we don't change the bag often enough when these is wet/ veggie material in the bag it will start to decompose in the can and may tear/ leak when we pull it out.  This is generally not an issue as we fill the can up fairly quick - but sometimes we forget to take out the trash before we leave town for vacation or camping a few days.  Wish they were just a tad thicker for puncture resistance, but that isn't a problem too often either.

review/summary: Unacceptable for kitchen garbage
review/text: I purchased these to use as advertised, e.g., in the kitchen, but find them to be ridiculously worthless.  In fact, I purchased these bags nearly two years ago and am using it now only because I ran out of my regular garbage bags (Green Pride: strong, doesn't begin degrading in the kitchen garbage can in one day...).  I recalled these bags being weak, but had entirely forgotten how frustratingly weak.  I couldn't even get it around the bin liner!  It tore instantly when I gave it the slightest tug!  Not only did it instantly tear, the tear proceeded more than half way down the bag before I'd realized what had happened.  I then recalled that these bags began degrading after only a couple of days.  We compost a lot and use a full 13 gallon kitchen bin, but these bags are not meant for even half of that.  If you put food scraps or moist garbage into these bags, the bags will begin breaking down immediately.  Within a couple of days, the bag had disintegrated and we were left to wash out the bin.  These bags are only good as doggy poop bags for people with 3 foot long hands.

After more than a year, when I was turning the oldest compost into bins of humus, I found loads of unaffected plastic bags, this color.<br /><br />And there's another thing - the kitchen size does not fit the kitchen receptacle.  It has to stretch tightly to "fit", and they tear in the process, often as not, since they used extremely thin material.<br /><br />Don't buy these.  Say what they will, they are impervious to rot after more than a year in a warm, moist, heavily populated compost bin.

review/summary: Composting with Bio Bags
review/text: We have a curbside green waste can that is picked up every week for composting at a major regional facility. Recently we have been allowed to include food waste, dirty paper towels, coffee filters, meat scraps, and bones. The only plastic allowed in the can is BioBag. No other brand is approved. It is truly amazing how much of the garbage can be composted.<br /><br />I have been using the bags for several months with excellent results. Amazon sells a RevAShelf double garbage can slider that I installed under the sink.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Pull-Out-Waste-Container-Slides-Chrome/dp/B000Y1DJO4/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1328639422&sr=8-12<br /><br />One can holds the BioBag and the other a standard tall kitchen bag for the plastic and non biodegradable waste. The 35qt containers work pretty well with the 13gal BioBag which doesn't have a drawstring. I don't know if these bags will work in a standard kitchen can. Make sure to get the package labeled "longer and stronger" in the red triangle on the left.<br /><br />If your waste is going to a garbage dump it will be buried and produce methane which is 20 times worse than the co2 produced by composting. Look up aerobic/ anaerobic digestion. Not much point in using the BioBag in this case.<br /><br />Being green is tough. These bags manufactured, shipped, warehoused, shipped, and thrown away. Obviously it would be better to compost on site and use the humus in your own garden. Oh well, we do what we can.

review/summary: Great for composting scraps, coffee, paper towels, napkins
review/text: We've used these 13-gallon bags for a year now. It's been great. We line a tall white plastic can with it. It sits open on the floor where people drop in coffee grind, veggie and food scraps (no raw meat), used paper towels and napkins. For some reason it doesn't smell! I think it's because of the coffee grind, paper towels and napkins mixing with the food scraps. It also doesn't attract flies. In five or six days, this bag is usually full. The night before garbage day, we tie it up and put it in our green bin. No fuss, no mess. Ocassionally, we would have to rinse the plastic can with a hose b/c something fell in there. --  For our purpose, this bag never broke on us. You should put most of your other waste (boxes, packaging materials, cans, bottles, papers etc.) in your recycling can anyway! For what little garbage is left, we still rely on the white plastic liners (one per week) with the pink draw string until a good company comes up with sturdier, affordable biodegradable bags.

review/summary: Excellent bag alternative to plastic
review/text: I've been using this product for over 3 years and I've enjoyed knowing that I'm not contributing to the plastic problem every week. If you're looking at this product, you're probably looking at an alternative to using plastic trash bags and you've found the best that's out there as of 2011. I looked at all the other kinds and this one is fully compostable and safe for our environment. They've improved the "flimsiness" of the product since I started using them in '08; they're a little tougher than before. The one thing you want to be careful of is to not put overly wet material into the bottom of the bag, because if it sits for over a week, it may leak through. There are some pretty easy workaround solutions: 1) let the material dry-up before you place it in the bag or 2) make sure there's some other less soluble material at the bottom (like a cereal or bread bag) that will not let wet material leak through. For example, the only thing I have to be careful of is my coffee grounds from my french press; I simply let them dry overnight before I dump them into the trash -easy. I don't miss the draw string from the plastic bags (which would sometimes rip out anyways). And I don't miss the ties; I just leave enough room at the top to make sure I can tie it together.

review/summary: Nice idea, didn't work for us
review/text: I really like the idea of these bags, but for us, they didn't work...before these we used regular trash bags, which we always purchased the ones with the cinch ties. With these, we have to leave a lot extra bag out of the trash can so we can have enough to tie shut, which means we go through these twice as fast. The quality seems fine for what they are, but we won't be purchasing them again, as they just cause too much frustration for us.

review/text: I've been suing these for a couple years now.  I've given them as holiday gifts to start others in this good habit.  They hold up for a long time (two weeks easily) as long as I take care to put moist things in the middle and not along the edge of the bag.  It easy to do and they never break down, tear or leak with normal use.  Get them, you'll be glad you did!

review/summary: Tall Kitchen bags don't fit anything!
review/text: I got these bags to use in a regular tall kitchen bag and they don't work.  They don't fit any trash can that would be considered a "tall kitchen bag."  They aren't long enough to get to the bottom of the trash can and they aren't big enough around either.  Don't buy these if that's what you are going to use them for.  I use the 33 gallon bags for a larger trash can I have and they work great, but the tall kitchen size are pretty much worthless.

review/summary: Not very sturdy, but....
review/text: I suppose it depends on your needs.  There's only my wife and I, and we don't generate that much trash.  So we probably expect one of these bags to last about a full week - which is FAR too long.  If you're dumping anything moist into them (coffee grounds for instance), forget it.  They'll begin to break down almost immediately.  Every time we'd change out the bag - it had tears and was already falling apart.<br /><br />If you need to change your garbage bag every 2-3 days, you're probably alright.  But beyond that, count on some troubles.

I put paper in bottom before adding any wet garbage (just to be safe) & I take bag out to the garbage can in about 5 days.  I don't ask this bag to perform like my old plastic bags ...afterall it's meant to be biodegradable. So far no breakage or accidents.

review/summary: Too small for tall kitchen size
review/text: I love these bags, because I can finally compost kitchen scraps without a big mess.  But the 13 gallon size is a lot smaller than a polyethelene plastic bag of the same size.  It doesnt fit into my 13 gallon trash can, not even close.  I'd say the 13 gallon bags are more like 8 gallon bags.  Perfect for a 5 gallon bucket.

review/summary: NO more plastic clogging up landfills!!!!
review/text: I have been using this product for 2 years. I first purchased them at WHOLE PAYCHECK (I mean Whole Foods) so they were expensive. I can now afford them if I buy them in bulk of Amazon. I go thru one per week. One caveat is that if you put something acidic in them during the week (say lime rinds or chile pepper peelings) they may start to biodegrade a hole right out the bottom before they make it to the trash can. For this reason I take the entire trash can to the the outside bin and dump which almost defeats their purpose?!They are indeed entirely biodegradable-no bits of plastic remaining hence the corn cob on the label as clue to the consumer.

review/summary: Great Bags!
review/text: The bags work great!  First, I must say that they are not quite as strong as the standard black plastic kind.  But with no landfill waste, they're totally worth it.  Really, they're strong enough.<br /><br />I live in a house with 6 people so our garbage is a mess (people always try and cram in as much crap as they possibly can).  In this scenario the bags will rip due to overstuffing.  So I just take them out with the whole garbage can.  This way the bag keeps the can clean, and we dont toss shitloads of bags into the landfill.<br /><br />I recommend!

review/summary: good for specific uses
review/text: Here's how I use it, and why it's great. We have a composting toilet, and I need to empty those contents into a bag in order to put it into a bigger composting system. For me, the rather high cost (including double bagging) is negligible for our purposes. We don't use these up like normal refuse liners, rather they are specific for the compost process. Don't buy these expecting for them to be a cost effective (yet green) swap out for your normal trash bags. They are more expensive and they are not as strong. But if you have a lot of organic material and you want to keep everything moving smoothly, give these a shot.

review/text: The other bags I was using (perf go green),  I found out,  were not actuallly plastic free I consider myself pretty knowledgeable when it comes to green products so I felt tricked to say the least.  These are made of cornstarch so they are the ones to use if you wanna be really green.  I don't put alot of garbage in them so I can't say they would stand up to that,  and I think they could use handles since they are hard to tie,  a little thin as well, but worth it to avoid the plastic.  The price is great compared to stores hardly anyone carries these and if they do they are about 6.00 per box

I would definately recommend especially since they are hard to find in the reg. grocery stores.

review/summary: Better than expected
review/text: Thanks to all prior reviews to help me decide to give this a try and I'm hoping that my experience can encourage You!  It is not a no tear/poke trash bag.  My compromise to the poking or wetness issue is to use a newspaper lining for between the bag and the trash can along with a container of baking soda then one more sheet of newspaper inside the bag.  This helps with absorbing the condensation and prevent common tears.  I know, I'm wasting paper.  But, if I don't find a responsible routine or green item that is convenient, the Family will not be so eager to follow!  My theory is that I'm only being about 90% eco-conscious with a product that can be 100% good.  But, if I don't find a way, we will only be frustrated and falsely find these bags not working for us at all and going back to the mere 10% responsible minded citizens using recycled bags (which is still great for our kitchen recycling trash!).  The kitchen trash goes to the outside garbage 1/2 to 2/3 full every 3 to 4 days (the smell starts and we did not want to stuff it only to have it tear). These BioBags are more expensive than the traditional trash bags, but this routine works well with our family, and we feel better if our regular trash is going straight to the landfill w/o stopping off at the possible recycling sorting facility as our area have a great independent recycling system with lots of toxic/hazardous round up opportunities and locations.

review/summary: Too thin, too short, too bad.
review/text: I bought a couple of boxes of these at the local grocery store and figured I would give them a try. Bad decision.<br /><br />They look nice (not sure why that matters in a garbage bag), and the idea behind them is sound, but the functionality is terrible. They're FAR too thin, they rip through almost immediately, and they aren't even tall enough for a standard 13 gallon kitchen can. They're fairly expensive as well, so after the first 3 bags ripped and I ended up throwing the remaining 21 of them away, I'm extremely disappointed in them. BioBag has a long way to go before their product is ready for prime-time.

review/summary: Garbage all over the floor
review/text: I was hoping for a ecological solution to the plastic garbage bags used in our community and decided to try these bags, even though they cost nearly 6 times more than Costco's conventional plastic bags. Sorry but these bags are not the solution. They are not only too thin for the job, but also not large enough for the average garbage can, and lack a convenient way to secure them. Admittedly, perhaps if you only fill them half full you probably could make them work, but then you are making twice as many trips to your main garbage can and the price differential increases to NEARLY 12 TIMES THE COST OF A CONVENTIONAL BAG. You are never going to convince many people to be more environmentally friendly with this product.

review/summary: 3.5* snack for a non-chocophile
review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: not as good as the 100-calorie Oreos
review/text: With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.

review/summary: THESE ARE TRUE 'MAINSTREAM' DIET SNACKS --
review/text: FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, "100 calorie packs" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + "ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS" & "ARTIFICIAL COLORS" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.

review/summary: Chocolate Wafers in an Identity Crisis as Oreos...But If Deception Helps Monitor Calories, Why Not?
review/text: I hate to admit I miss the lard. I was the one in your 4th-grade class who unscrewed the Oreo, ate all the white middle, licked the wafers clean and then ate the hardened chocolate wafers. That's the image I have of this cookie. Even Barbra Streisand coyly named her singing trio at the beginning of "A Star Is Born" the Oreos because she had two back-up singers who were black. That's why the idea of an Oreo Thin Crisp is rather lost on me.<br /><br />It is a single, nickel-sized baked chocolate wafer that more resembles a bleached Wheat Thin than the original Oreo. It does have some dusting of a white fructose sprinkle as perhaps a nostalgic tribute. Don't get me wrong, as the Oreo Thin Crisps are perfectly fine as low-calorie chocolate wafer alternatives go. They simply lack the lip-smacking satisfaction of a disassembled Oreo digested in pieces. The whole point of the 0.81-ounce bag of wafers is to tout that they are "100 Calorie Packs", a fine idea for Weight Watchers advocates and the rest of us who should be watching our weight. It's just that I don't feel very satisfied after finishing just one pack.

review/summary: Oreo Crisps
review/text: Nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets, we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs, die an early death and no longer be able to give Nabisco money.<br /><br />Kidding aside, these are loveable. The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth.

review/text: I don't usually like really crispy cookies, but the taste of these changed my mind.  I like that you get quite a few for only 100 calories.  I often go for "quantity" over "quality" so I would rather have a few thin crisp cookies than one regular cookie.
