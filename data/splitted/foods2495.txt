review/summary: Food from the plant gods
review/text: I got a not-so-lucky bamboo that was trying to survive, but I have not really seen it  thriving -- it's not drying up but there aren't any noticeable changes, either. I had another stalk that had the top half died and I had to cut off that portion to try to salvage the bottom stalk as the roots still seem healthy. I read the reviews of this product, and they seem promising, so I decided to get it and see what happens, because I really wanted to prove that I have some green thumb in me.<br /><br />So far my bamboo are starting to show some positive results. The little stalk that I salvaged is now sprouting new roots, and it's now got a leaf stalk growing within a few weeks of the food solution, which I never thought would happen (I was almost ready to give up on that piece). I see the leaf stalk growing every day. The other stalk didn't have much progress, though, at least on its existing leaves, but I am noticing a little leaf bump on one of its sections (plus a set of new roots) so I still think it's surviving.<br /><br />I'll take pictures when it starts looking less sad (when it's leafed up a bit more). I can't really say I still have a green thumb in me, but I am happy that at least I can keep my lucky bamboo alive (considering it's one of the more resilient and easy-to-care plants, it would be embarrassing if I still manage to kill it).

review/summary: Dense European-style bread, sort of
review/text: I bought this bread to try as a cheaper alternative to Mestemacher's -- the sort of dense, moist rye bread commonly sold in packets in Europe, especially Germany.  Lowell seems to be an importer of various European foods, so I was hoping for quality similar to that of Mestemacher.  But this bread is definitely less flavorful and falls apart more easily.  Moreover, it's not truly whole rye, but "whole grain rye" -- i.e., contains wheat, which noticeably dilutes the rye goodness.  Unfortunately Amazon doesn't show the ingredients list.  Packaging suggests it's a product of Poland.

review/summary: This is the real deal
review/text: Be careful!  After trying this wonderful blend of spices, with great complexity of flavor, that they say is made with 35 ingredients, I found ras el hanout in my local grocery store.  When I tried it alongside this one, there was no comparison.  Then I checked the label--the local one had only 8 ingredients!  It went into the trash and another order was placed to Zamouri.<br /><br />Ras el hanout can be used in a number of Moroccan dishes that are fabulous, although they tend to be complex to prepare--although if you're in the mood they are worth the effort.  But I also use it in tomato soup to give an amazing richness of flavor to it, transforming an everyday dish to a company dish.  Today I'm braising short ribs, and when I've cooked down the braising liquid I'll add ras el hanout to provide a symphony of flavor to it.  I haven't tried it with tomatoes and cheese on an omelet, but it's the sort of thing that's likely to be fabulous.  With a little experimentation, you'll find your own favorite uses for it.

review/summary: Excellent ras-el-hanout
review/text: About ten years ago a friend made amazing Algerian couscous for us in which she used a bottle of ras-el-hanout purchased in France under the Ducros brand name.  It was fabulous and for years I tried finding the same spice/flavor/scent in hopes of duplicating our unforgettable feast - with repeated disappointments.  I read the reviews for the Zamouri ras-el-hanout and decided to take a chance, even though I was about to give up hope. And what do you know, this IS the real thing - just incredible. Do yourself a favor and saute some crushed garlic and onion in olive oil, add some diced assorted vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, zucchini, eggplant etc.), throw in some raisins, garbanzo beans, 1T cumin and 3T of this wonderful ras-el-hanout... serve over couscous and you're off to a very happy evening!

review/text: This spice blend means we give you the best we got.  Zamouri is one of the most reliable and expert of shops on the web.  I usually try to make my own blends, but for tagine, I let these folks do the work.  My job is not letting it get stale.  Four ounces is plenty.  But I am a somewhat heavy user.  Go with two ounces.  The shelf life is about six months in the cool and dark before the power starts to fall off.<br /><br />They have cute little spice tagines like the one pictured, and many more in a variety of colors and styles.  But I am not good at presentation and I am happy with the jar it comes in.  Fish, chicken, cauliflower, turnip -- all good!  And you can go to the red side as well.  But I could not resist their large tagine, charcoal burner and bellows to do some outdoors.  High quality, tasty and fragrant.  I cannot find or produce the equal. Surrender.

review/summary: Great Middle Eastern Spice
review/text: This Ras El Hanout is a wonderful, authentic  spice that is difficult to recreate yourself.  It's hard to find and really enhances Middle Eastern cuisine.  This blend  includes lavender and roses, as well as more common cinnamon and cumin. Ras El Hanout gives a distinctive Middle Eastern flavor to a dish.  I use it in my Moroccan chicken, which I prepare in a crock pot.  A tagine would of course be even better!  For my recipe, I use organic  boneless chicken, a few tablespoons of high quality extra virgin olive oil,  potatoes or sweet potatoes,  quartered onions, lots of "baby" carrots, chick peas, cans of whole or diced tomatoes, diced garlic, honey, diced/chopped dried fruit such as apricots and/or prunes, chopped preserved lemon (you can buy or very easy to make), and then some  additional cinnamon and cumin, plus black pepper in addition to Ras Al Hanout to taste.  You do want to add enough to really flavor the "stew."  Moroccan chicken is very healthy and  fantastic served over whole wheat couscous.  For a lower carb version, you can omit the potatoes and serve over greens.  My kids love it, but it's also special enough for company.  If you enjoy Moroccan food or experimenting with spices, it's a great addition to your pantry!

review/text: I love Morrocan chicken and a good Ras El Hanout spice is essential for this dish.  I was suprised at this blend, it differs significantly in the balance of flavors from the one I was originally introduced to.  This is a much more savory - curry-like spice than the more sweetly cinammon-heavy original I started with.  I'll have to try others to understand better if there is a 'standard' for Ras El Hanout!

review/summary: Genuine Ras El Hanout
review/text: 'Ras El Hanout' means 'top of the shop', indicating a blend of many spices (in some instances, more than 100) as favoured by whatever spice merchant happens to be selling it to you.  Thus, it varies greatly in composition from one merchant to another.  Some are more 'traditional' blends than others, and some are just lazy Westernised versions about as exotic as K-Mart Curry Powder.<br /><br />This is not a 'lazy' Ras El Hanout.<br /><br />Coming in at a reasonable 35 spices (including Rose Powder, Lavender Powder, Grains Of Paradise, and 32 others), this lovely blend strikes just the right balance of spicy, sweet, floral, and savoury.  I use it with Couscous, Hummus, Tabouli, Kebabs, Chicken Bastila - really anything North African or Middle Eastern.  Hell, I'll even dust some Naan lightly with it prior to heating in my oven; I'm not some xenophobic Food Purist!<br /><br />Try it, you'll like it...

review/summary: A very authentic Moroccan spice blend
review/text: As with many ethnic spice mixtures, there is no one recipe for Ras el Hanout.  Each family and spice merchant has their own, highly treasured and guarded version of this traditional blend.  This particular product is of high quality and arrived fresh (which isn't always the case with spices that I have purchased on-line).<br /><br />Ras el Hanout starts off with strong, curry-like flavors that betrays it's Indian origins followed by subtle, traditional African flavors such as nigella and rosebuds.  Although I was very pleased with this blend I do think that it is over-priced.  I shop for most of my spices at ethnic markets (mostly Indian and Middle Eastern) and find their mixtures to be not only fresh but REALLY affordable.  I am using this mixture with my new tagine and if I use it often enough I will seek out an African grocery store that has a similar product at a price that Moroccan expatriates will be willing to pay. If you don't live near a city that is large enough to have that type of store, then I think that this is the best Ras el Hanout available on-line.  As a matter of fact, a tangine cookbook that I bought recently singled out Zamouri as THE source for this delicious, exotic blend.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845979486">Tagines & Couscous: Delicious Recipes for Moroccan One-pot Cooking</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CBT7TC">Emile Henry Flame Top 2.6-Quart Tagine Red</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AQDCPA">Harissa Paste 8.0 Oz By Zamouri Spices</a>

review/text: I opened the bag assuming there would be three different types of candy, however in my bag, there were four. There was one which had a green package, the candy was green, too...this one fizzed from the inside out and tasted like Ramune. There was another, blue packaged one, it tasted minutely menthol-like but not...it was a very odd taste...and it tasted like blue rasberry at the same time...VERY odd...then there was one with a yellow package (not see-through) and it tasted like ramune with a hint of bubble gum...very slight hint of bubblegum...it's hard to put a flavor to the taste, though. The fourth, it had a clear package, and looked a little odd with sugar all over it...very bumpy...(the candy itself was green and white in color) and that candy tasted entirely like melon. None of them were very sour... the one that tasted entirely like ramune was the one that tasted the most sour, the rest of them were hardly sour at all (at least to me) [I hope this helped, since the package didn't come with a key to the flavors.]<br /><br />I thought they were good, I didn't really like the bubblegum one though...but that's just because I don't like the flavor 'bubblegum'...Enjoy your candy... :)

review/text: I used to buy these from FYE all the time, but have been unable to find them there for a while (although they still carry Ramune sodas).<br />This time, I purchased this bag for my boyfriend.  I noticed that they changed one of the flavors..  I remember a peach and pink one that tasted like sweet apples, but I think his bag had strawberry flavor instead.<br />Previously, I had purchased a bag for my brother (apple version) and he really liked it as well.<br />My favorite was the apple kind and I don't like strawberry so I was a little disappointed about that, but it wasn't bought for me and the recipient really enjoyed it, so I can't really complain.<br />The flavors are unique, though..  Some are fizzy, minty, sweet, a bit sour.  It's good candy and it is a bit overpriced, but it's hard to find so it's worth it.

I switched to this for the higher protein and fat content, and within about 2 months, their coats seem glossier. I can't say anything about if they shed less,but the quality of the coat feels better. Warning- because of the higher fat and protein content, you only feed about half as much food as you would on a normal diet. For example, my 3 cats got 2 cups of the science diet total a day, and now they get 1 cup a day of the professional to maintain the same weight (all my guys are a good weight).

review/summary: Just the right chewiness
review/text: There are five flavors of Tootsie roll candies:<br /><br />Vanilla - a hint of vanilla<br />Cherry - tastes like pink bubblegum<br />Lemon, Lime, Orange - a touch of citric acid powder (I can't tell the separate flavors apart. They're distinguished by different food dyes).<br /><br />My favorite thing about this candy is its texture: the chewiness is just right: not jaw-breakingly stiff and not too gummy. I imagine Silly Putty would have the same chewiness as Tootsie roll candies, although I haven't tested this hypothesis for myself. The next time my sister comes up for a visit, I'll ask one of my nieces for her input.

review/text: I love this stuff. I tried the original and went through the bottle in a week, so I decided to try the XXXtra hot. Its not scary hot, but it does have a deep lingering warmth that lasts about 20 minutes. Perfect flavor, with heat that doesn't ruin your taco or whatever. I put it on everything, even a spoon. Too much will give you "Firehea" (I coined that word) but its so good you won't care about the next morning.

review/summary: Great to have on hand: they keep for ever and are very tasty!
review/text: I grew up up in a family that loved mushrooms, so I love using them in my cooking. Dried mushrooms are convenient because they keep so well! I like the flavor of Oyster mushrooms and JR Mushrooms brand has an excellent quality.<br /><br />To reconstitute them I put them in water and then put them into the microwave for 4 minutes to get the water boiling. Then let them cool. If some of them are still hard to cut I repeat the process on the ones that are still not soft. Then I cook with them like I would with fresh mushrooms.<br /><br />They are easy to use in many different ways. They taste great sauteed in butter. I like adding them to stews or as ingredient for any sauce I make for cooking chicken. I also found they go great with any Indian sauce, like Pataks: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JMAVPS">Pataks Vindaloo Curry Paste 10 Oz</a><br /><br />Mushrooms, what do they taste like:<br /><br />* OYSTER - mild, slightly nutty<br />* PORCINI - sweet, nutty flavor reminds me of hazelnut<br />* CHANTERELLES - sweet mushrooms with flavors that make me think of corn<br />* BLACK TRYMPETS - smokey flavor<br />* CREMENI - more flavorful than button mushrooms, but not as strong as shiitake or portobellos<br />* ENOKI - very delicate flavor, slightly crunchy if fried<br />* PORTOBELLOS - meaty flavor<br />* SHIITAKES - rich, almost beefy flavor<br /><br />JR Mushrooms offer great quality at reasonable price. I recommend them!<br /><br />Ali Julia review

review/text: I got hooked on Japanese Curry when I was on my mission in Japan.  I love the stuff, but I have always had a hard time finding a place to buy it.  I don't like paying more for the small boxes at the super market, and there aren't any markets that carry this close to me.  I'd looked on Amazon before, but they didn't carry it then.  I hope they continue to carry this Curry now.  I love that they ship it right too me, and it still costs about the same per box as when I would go to the Asian Market back in my home town of Eugene.

review/text: We like this mix when time is shorter or I don't have everything I need for chicken curry made from scratch.  It is a hot mix, but with Shan spice mixes you can use what you like, so if you're leery of the heat, I would suggest just using 1/4-1/2 a packet first. If you want it hotter next time, increase the amount.  I'm surprised at the price for this - we get these mixes locally for 99 cents a box.  Might want to check with the seller what quantity this price is for.

review/text: Hey all-<br />This is probably the best espresso to come out of a Tassimo. That being said- NO T-Disk is worth more than 60 cents a pop, so this is overpriced. When you review an item and give it 1 star, you are rating the product as bad and it gives the wrong impression when you are simply upset about being ripped off. I agree with you though, this is currently outrageously overpriced considering I was getting three packs for something like 50 cents per serving.

After I discovered this coffee, I not only have the most delicious coffee at home at my disposal, but I am also able to save some money!<br />My only complaints is that its not available everywhere, and the prices keep fluctuating! I use up at least 1 and half or 2 cans a week, and I need a minimum of 8 cans a week. It can get expensive if the subscribe and save offer is not available. Unfortunately, Amazon cancelled the subscribe and save offer right after I got the first delivery at an amazing price. I do not get these at the local super markets in NYC and my only option of buying them is online.

review/text: It's incredibly tasty.  I'd recommend that any hot/spice lover give it a try.  I'll attempt to give an objective description, but well, it's a spice.  You'll really have to taste it yourself.<br /><br />Hotness: mild or roughly like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 12 oz.</a><br /><br />Saltyness: none!  It's just pepper.<br /><br />Absorption: v.high, v.finely ground; unable to observe any small flecks after cooking into my standard spice test: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004SIZK5K">Top Ramen Variety Pack 48ct (24-3oz Beef-24-3oz Chicken)</a><br /><br />It has a very clean smooth taste, almost like adding pure "hotness" to food without the smoky overtone of Tobasco, the roughness of black pepper, or the cumin of chili sauces.  It has a very slight "cling" or "linger"; ie. as with habanero peppers, where the more you eat, the hotter it gets.<br /><br />One or two sips of water will wash it clean.  I haven't tried it with mixed spiced and milder dishes, but due to how easy it is to sip the hotness away, it should work very well there.

It makes a good strong cup of tea. These teabags are a bit much for a 6oz tea cup but are perfect for a large mug (16oz maybe) or small teapot. It had a delicious smooth taste, I still take mine with cream and sugar like I always take my black tea.<br /><br />I cannot emphasis how much I dislike the taste of Lipton and the like.... so if you too cannot stand Lipton... but want a decent tea that still comes in tea bags this might be a tea you will want to give a try. This just might be the tea for you.

It's best with milk and sugar, and indeed may be somewhat overpowering without adding milk to balance the tannins, which are not overtly in your face but definitely a palpable note that adds to the complex character of this tea.<br /><br />If you like strong black tea with mild and sugar, you will love London Cuppa. I can now see why they drink more tea back in Dear Old Blighty than anywhere else in the world.

Kosher OU</a> and it's soooo tasty! I mean, tie me to an anthill and fill my ears with jam, this stuff is TASTY!!! It's french and it's sweet, it's rich and it's robust. YUM YUM!

review/summary: LOVE THIS SAUCE!
review/text: I first discovered this sauce in the grocery store and decided to give it a try.  I am now addicted to it!  It's the only wing sauce that I LOVE.  Then one day, I noticed they were out of stock at the grocery store. Of course, I went into panic mode. But I sat back and knew that there are various grocery store chains in my area so I would look elsewhere.  I really freaked out when I couldn't find this sauce anywhere!  Thank goodness for Amazon!  I was able to find it here and order it by the 6 pack.  I treat this stuff like gold (only close friends and family are allowed to have any) and love it on just about anything.  When I have something with other wing sauces, it just doesn't compare.  If you haven't had it, you must give it a try. If you don't like it, send me the rest of your bottles!  (note: you have to get the HOT version--cleans your sinuses out!)

review/text: Caribou Daybreak Morning Blend coffee is one of my favorite blends.  I don't like a strong coffee, and this one is a little less than medium strength but has a really smooth rich coffee taste, it's excellent.  If you are a lover of the Starbucks strength coffee, this probably would not be one you would enjoy.

review/text: I just LOVE this coffee!  It's just so light, not heavy and "burned" like a lot of morning coffees, but it has all the caffeine that you're accustomed to for morning.  I have always loved Caribou's coffees WAY over Starbuck's (Starbuck's is AWESOME for growing roses, however), and this one is just perfect for us.  It's not overdone, just a smooth, rich blend of some of the most awesome beans available.  If you put your nose close enough to your Keurig, this one is a delight to smell after you pull down the handle and it pierces the top. Ahhhhh!  SO LOVE this stuff, highly highly recommend!

review/summary: I don't have to travel to Minnesota
review/text: The best coffeehouse in the USA is Caribou Coffee. That's just an opinion, but an opinion I'd challenge anyone to test. When I go to the Mall of the Americas in Minnesota, the first place I stop is the Caribou Coffee shop. I don't like Starbucks coffee at all, and usually look for any alternative.<br />Buying these Caribou coffee pods aren't up to the in house experience, but still enjoyable (not as good as grinding and brewing your own with their blend either). This coffee pod is filled (possibly overfilled) so it's not a wimpy coffee at all. If you're looking for a great strong coffee on the mild side Daybreak may be a good option for you. My best advice is to wait till it's shipped and sold by Amazon for the best price, but if that isn't an option, you may want to get your caffeine fix with an alternative seller.

review/summary: Just when I thought it couldn't get any better than Caribou's signature blend, along comes Daybreak!
review/text: When I picked up a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>, I really thought I'd found the best good-cuppa-coffee to please everyone in our household.  Caribou is a coffee company that is very popular in Chicago and are known for producing great quality coffee.  With their reputation, I've always been eager to try the other blends that are available in k cup form, but they are often hard to come by.<br /><br />I ordered a 5 k cup sampler size of this blend directly for Keurig because I was so happy with the Caribou Blend that I couldn't wait to try the company's other offerings.  I'm so thankful I did, because the Daybreak Morning Blend just hit the original blend out the park!<br /><br />I enjoy a medium roast with a kick.  Just because I don't like a dark, bitter cup of coffee doesn't mean I want to skimp on flavor or aroma.  And Caribou Daybreak really delivers in both of those departments.  This tastes like a fresh brewed cup that you'd pick up at a coffee shop.  It goes great with a little skim milk, too.  A perfect compliment to breakfast with a caffeine kick to get you going in the morning.<br /><br />The only downside to this blend is that I haven't been able to find it in store near us.  So we have to order it online, which seems a little pricier (surprisingly).  Oh well, I still think this blend is completely worth it.  It's my new go-to k cup!

review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for almost 2 years now. I've tried tons of k-cups from companies including Green Mountain, Timothy's, Folgers's, Coffee People, Gloria Jean's, etc. This is by far the best coffee I've found. I normally brew on the larger cup size (9.25 oz) and it is the ideal cup of coffee. Not too strong, not too weak. The aftertaste is pleasant and not bitter. I would definitely recommend this coffee to anyone and everyone.

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup coffee
review/text: Taste is a personal choice and I prefer light roast coffees. My favorite brand is Peets, but until Peets gets into the K-Cup market this will have to do. This brew is light and not bitter, however I do detect a slight, stale flavor. However this stale flavor is common in nearly all ground coffee, including the tail end of a bag of my beloved Peets coffee. I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk. This has happened when I run out of milk (cow, soy or almond) and I just don't feel like using aspartame (Nutrasweet).

review/text: My current preference in coffees is more towards milder brews...especially at the start of a day. Daybreak morning blend gives me what I need in that first morning coffee: a definitive coffee taste, the caffeine kickstart, and the reassuring coffee smell that lets you know another day has started...<br /><br />It does so without being overpowering or bitter. I also enjoy this in the evening while reading, watching TV or sitting around and talking. You get what you need from a cup, but in moderation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for your K-Cup rotation of flavors...
