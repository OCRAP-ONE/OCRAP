review/summary: Made and packaged in USA...
review/text: I purchased these as an alternative to the duck jerky (made in China) that I no longer wanted to feed to my small/medium dogs.  Since one is allergic to chicken my choices are limited.  These arrived today and my 3 dogs sniffed them suspiciously.  I broke them in half for them and they decided to give them a try.  They seemed to like them...they are different then I thought they would be.  They are almost the texture of a soft granola bar and not like jerky at all.  They are about 2" by .5" and the  contents of the bag were not crumbly like some have described.  All in all, I think these will work to replace the  jerky and since they are made and packaged in the US, I feel better about giving them treats.... Oh, and the  cost is pretty good too...

review/summary: Excellent treats and made in the USA
review/text: I've tried all three (and yes, the Salmon is fishy smelling and a bit greasy) and the dogs love them all. It is hard to find dog treats worth buying that are made in the USA that don't cost a fortune. These are reasonable. Don't be fooled by companies that are based in the US but the actual manufacture is in a country not to be named. I also will buy treats made in Canada. I think most pet stores, including ones like Petsmart and Petco are charging way too much for DOG TREATS. I found mine at a human health food store (Fruitful Yield) and was surprised at the cost. Now I see I can order all three from Amazon, shipped for a comparable price. Just wish I could order items in the US and have them shipped from Amazon to say England or Australia. Would love to easily send these to my friends' dogs.

review/summary: very good value for organic treats-good for your pupper
review/text: These are very inexpensive at this site because they are usually twice the price in all the typical pet stores you usually go to.  They are an awesome deal for organic.  I try to feed my dog only organic food and treats as close to all organic as I can.  I had a dog that was very young, 2 1/2, and he died from cancer and ever since then, I have been very cautious of what I feed my dog now.  Organic does make the difference and these treats are low in calories so they are a good treat to give your dog if you are trying to control his weight.  You don't have to feel guility giving him/her these treats, they are small and as I mentioned low calorie.  I would reccomend these to any dog owner and I have also purchased the chicken, duck and salmon treats made by Plato, all good choices.  The Salmon ones are very very stinky though, beware of those, good for your dog though, lots of Omega 3's in them.

review/summary: My Chihuahuas HATE This Product
review/text: My two Chihuahuas loved "Cadet Gourmet Pet Treats Duck Breast Fillets", the 32-Ounce package I had been buying at Costco.  However, I discovered it was made in China and feared this product could make them sick or cause death.  So I started searching for a company in the USA that made dog jerky treats.  I found Plato Natural Duck Strips and ordered a bag.  This product does not look like or smell like duck jerky strips.  My Chihuahuas sniffed it and just walked away.  It doesn't even smell like duck.  Rather, it smells somewhat fishy.  A waste of my money!

review/summary: These are duck chunks not strips
review/text: My darling dog can only eat duck snacks, she is allergic to everything else. I had ordered Plato duck strips before and they are excellent. (Seriously, is there anything a dog won't eat?) But these are CHUNKS, thus the FOUR stars instead of five. They are about 2 inches long and an inch wide, preformed snacks. The Plato strips I bought before were duck strips, not preformed. Of course she loved these but they are covered in a bit of "duck dust" for lack of a better term, so I didn't like to handle them as well as strips. Shipping was quick. The packaging says that these are made in America, important to me. If I am going to pay premium prices for dog snacks, I don't want to kill her with Chinese products! If you asked her, she would give them FIVE stars, because they smell "duckier".

review/text: These are expensive (I would guess the 24 oz pkg contains maybe 20 sticks), but you can cut or break them in half (harder to break smaller pieces off) to make them last longer.  They're a huge hit with our two big guys - have to admit I was shocked at how quickly our big dog consumed one when we first opened the package!  I like varying protein source, so they split one each morning along with a mix of other snacks - it's a real treat for them, and Made in USA is a BIG plus for me as "Mom."

review/text: I got these from my local pet store, where they carry quality items (made in USA, no grain fillers, etc.).  I brought my pooch in one day for his regular food and the shop owner gave the pooch two of these.  Needless to say, I am a sucker for my pooch so of course I bought them.  After my dog had one of his legs amputated due to bone cancer, I switched from the common store brands to higher quality items like this.  I have noticed a marked improvement in my dog's overall recovery.  Even if your dog isn't suffering any kind of terminal illness, I recommend that you consider these sticks.

review/summary: Never again buy in this unstable glass bottle
review/text: The oil was fine but the glass bottle not stable due to small bottom surface with rounded edges. Thus it slipped off its shelf and shattered on the floor. Big waste, big mess. Luckily I like the odor because it soaked in. Big job to clean up with broken glass. Baking soda, I hope, will absorb the bulk of that which remains, staining my floor. And I can go out and buy a product that garages use in oil spill clean up. In the future I will buy only plastic-bottled sesame oil. And hope I remember to check the bottle's bottom for common-sense stability.<br /><br />UPDATE: Now, in August of 2012, I want to reiterate my observation of how unstable this glass bottle is. I wound up with a second bottle of this brand - it was given to me - and the same thing happened. It is simply not stable on the shelf or in the door of a refrigerator where I keep such oils due to their potential to become rancid at higher temperatures; nor would it be stable on a cupboard shelf. There are several other brands of sesame oil available.

review/text: Ohhhhh.... this is fabulous.  There's a recipe inside the wrapper for some sort of lovely-looking rice salad dish using this tapenade, but we may never get to it -- because the tapenade is so delightful all by itself with just crackers or crusty fresh bread.  I love it with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FSK58S">LU Herbes De Provence Flatbread Crackers, 4.25-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Great to have both the tapenade and the crackers in the house for an instant appetizer when guests drop by unexpectedly for a meal or a drink.  These little green jars are almost worth their weight in gold (okay, that's an exaggeration, but not by much), and you'll be very glad to have them on your shelf.  Beware:  they won't last long!<br /><br />Shelf-stable until opened; then refrigerate if you're lucky enough to have any leftovers.  :)  Caution:  quite salty, because of the olives -- not appropriate for people medically advised to drastically reduce sodium, but probably acceptable in moderation for most people in combination with something such as the recommended flatbread crackers, which will help offset the salty olives and make the average sodium in the combined appetizer more reasonable.

review/summary: Marvelous Olive Tapenade
review/text: This product is the best Olive Tapenade in the world, according to my wife, an olive Tapenade tasting expert.  It comes in several different styles and they are all marvelous.  The containers are small so it stays fresh.  If you like olives and a simple smear of this Tapenade on a cracker or toast, this is a treat.  Cat Cora knows her olives.

review/summary: Flavored? What flavor?
review/text: My mistake for not spotting the word, "flavored," but this is really awful! I was expecting Blue Mountain coffee and instead got this foul tasting coffee-like brew that has no coffee taste at all. Is it hazelnut? I hope not - I have nut allergies. Whatever it is, it overpowers any weak coffee flavor that may have been present at the beginning!<br /><br />Checking the ingredients on the package, we learn that it includes Arabica coffee and "natural and/or artificial flavors." Digging around the Wolfgang Puck website, we first learn that it's "Light flavored coffee with the essence of the islands (Flavored)" and finally, "Coconut Infusion Flavored Coffee."<br /><br />I never would have guessed coconut.

review/text: I love this coffee from Wolfgang Puck, it is always fresh, tasty and provides a consistent cup of java, one cup at a time.<br /><br />Best of all, you can taste the flavors that make Jamaica Blue Mountain coffee so famous. Of course, it is not 100% Blue Mountain, but a respectable blend of arabica beans that includes enough of that treasured bean to justify its name. And it is neither under nor over roasted, just done to the point where the flavors are best.

review/summary: Our new favorite Keurig pods.
review/text: This has become one of our favorite Keurig flavors. The taste is very smooth and the coconut flavor is not over-powering. We drink our coffee black, and some of the flavored coffees have a strong, almost bitter after-taste when cream and sugar aren't used. This one doesn't have that after-taste. I'm on my 4th reorder, and have started buying the larger boxes so I don't have to do without it.

review/text: I received a new coffee maker and  it has the option to use these coffee pods in the single serving side of the machine..Well decided to try a few varieties to see what might be good and what my guests might enjoy.<br /> Well I am blown away at HOW GOOD this variety, Jamaica Me Crazy tastes... I am not usually a fan of flavored coffee's but this is just enough of a light coconut flavor and scent to make it a nice variation .. This is particularly pleasant as a after dinner dessert coffee with a light amt of cream.. No sugar is really need.. I like the light sweet smell  that my cup of coffee give me . Such a pleasant experience..<br />  I will definitely be getting more of this variety and it also inspires me to want to try some others that Wolfgang Puck has as well..

review/text: This is a tasty orange sauce. We buy frozen orange-flavored chicken. The sauce pack included barely coats the meat, with nothing leftover to flavor the rice we serve with it. We used to buy a large size at Costco, but they don't seem to carry it any more. We are happier with the 20.75 ounce size, even though it costs a little more. You don't have a huge bottle open in the fridge for months, and the flavor is fresher. It took a long time to find an orange sauce we liked, and we hope Panda Express keeps making it.

I can now skip the step of breading/deep-frying the meat, as the sauce gives it plenty of flavor and lets you save on the fat and calories of the finished dish.  Definitely recommended!

review/summary: european pleasure in a tea cup
review/text: This is the best tea brand I have ever drank!! WOW..I tried some samples that were given to me as well. I did not think that the tea would taste so fresh and amazing. This tea has no after taste..NO AFTER TASTE..I have had many teas that after you drink them leave a bad taste in your mouth..this is what tea should all taste like. I will for now on only serve the best teas to my guests, and that means Gorreana teas..the smell = EXCELLENT..What a pleasure to know that this tea has been family owned for since the 1800's. I hope that more stores start carrying this tea in retails stores in San Jose, Calif. mmmmm

review/summary: Salmon Treats could be better
review/text: I've seen people offering these to their cats at cat shows, so I thought I'd try them on my cats.  I learned right away that I have several issues with them:  (1) They have kind of an off-odor, almost like turpentine.  (2) My cats weren't impressed.  They sniffed the treats, sort of chewed on them, then walked away. (3) The treats must be refrigerated after opening, which is not a huge problem but can be inconvenient at times. Try the chicken flavor instead -- the cats love it!

review/text: My cat adores these.  I crumble some over his (Halo salmon) dry food and he is in cat heaven.  He loves the chicken version, too.  These can also be "reconstituted" by adding a little water, as an alternative to wet food.  I love that the ingredient list contains a single item:  Freeze-dried wild salmon.  Simple and perfect.

review/summary: Delicious
review/text: My dog goes crazy for these treats!  Also, I noticed that the price fluxates, so if you are on a budget, you can check daily to see if the price goes up and down. When the price lowers, I usually order a few, as this dehydrated light-weight yummy treat does not get hard.  My dog is very old, and only has a few teeth.  Even when this product isn't fresh, my dog has no problem eating them.  This is one of the few treats that she loves.  I even keep them in the car so that she gets a treat when she's riding.  That's how fresh they stay.<br />I haven't been able to find these in the store. Only similar items, but nothing comes close. Also, if your dog is picky, don't be discouraged if you try different flavors and your dog only likes one flavor. My dog kind of goes back and forth, but always comes back to the beef.  The chicken flavor is very messy, but the beef flavor is easy to even break parts smaller without any crumbs dropping on your clothese.<br /><br />Excellent products.  Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: Cat Love These
review/text: I bought these as treats for my cat, and he absolutely loves them. In fact he likes them soo much I don't know where the container is as he has stolen it and hidden it somewhere.<br /><br />I should also mention not to give too many of these to a cat at once, they seem to expand in the stomach, and after I gave him 5 in a short period, he threw up a HUGE amount of the stuff. But I have never had a problem with one or two treats at a time.<br /><br />They also do not have much of an smell, I've had some dehydrated fish in the past that smelled horrible, that is not an issue with these.

review/summary: Kitties need their fix-- Like crack for cats
review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSWKBW">Halo Liv-a-Littles Whole Beef Treats</a><br /><br />We have purchased the beef, chicken and salmon for our kitty.  She goes crazy over all of the flavors.  I personally prefer the beef as they are easier to break/tear into smaller pieces.  The chicken tended to crumble slightly and leave some powder when broken.  The salmon is harder to break and tear which may mean too large of pieces for some cats.<br /><br />These do need to be refrigerated after opening so our kitty does tend to want to beg and explore at the refridgerator when we open it.

review/summary: Big name, mediocre product
review/text: Another reviewer summed it up nicely:  "The ingredients of Godiva are far from top notch. At the prices they charge, it's a crime that Godiva uses artificial vanilla (vanillin), palm kernel oil, lecithin, preservatives, and artificial flavors made in some factory off the New Jersey Turnpike."  Additionally, the company itself is not customer friendly.  Don't expect much help if there's a problem with the order or delivery.

Although, I will say that it took over a week to get to them. Took 2 or 3 days to ship it from wherever it came from and then, of course, UPS just took their sweet time to get it there. I just despise UPS!! USPS Priority is by far the better choice..for less money!

review/summary: A third of the box is simple squares of dark chocolate.
review/text: I have purchased this box once for myself and I was not impressed. I purchased it because I only eat dark chocolate.  I was sad to find that a third of the chocolate is plain squares of dark chocolate. They include a little manual showing pictures and descriptions of all of their chocolates and I was dissapointed to find that there were dark chocolates in the godiva line that were not included in the box. I found this especially upsetting because there were at least 5 or 6 spaces in the box where they could have replaced the plain chocolate pieces for these fancier dark chocolate pieces that weren't included.<br /><br />I have also received this as a Valentine's Day gift from my husband. He purchased it at Macy's and he was really embaressed when i opened it and all the pieces had a white film over them. We each tried a piece and they had that cracker like consistency and they wouldn't dissolve easily. They were obviously ruined by heat or they were just old. We tried to find a date on the box but Godiva doesn't date their candy. AND WHY NOT?? That is just careless. We went back to Macy's and got a refund. Luckily, there was a See's at the mall too, so we saved about $20 and just went there where I could pick out the few candies I like there.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Godiva for many years, but the quality is inconsistent and their ingredient list is anything but natural. I will just stick to local chocolate candy makers.
