review/summary: Decorating Made Easy
review/text: I bake and decorate more cookies than the Cookie Monster can eat at holiday time.  Although I can make and use my own products, I can't do it with the ease of this one.  It is more costly than a do-it-yourself variety, but oh, the convenience.<br /><br />I buy several colors.  The white can be used alone, to soften the shades of other colors, or even to create custom designs.  To do that, allow the white color to flow onto your cookie, spreading it with a toothpick.  Now, you can put just one, or several small drops of color onto the white icing.  Gently draw the colored icing drops through the white icing to create designs, swirls, even initials.<br /><br />Initially, I warm the bottles up (remove the caps first) in the microwave.  If you are doing a lot of designing, the icing will not flow easily as it cools.  To solve that problem, put your icing bottles into a rectangular, plastic container that has a few inches of very warm water in it.  Meanwhile, keep your four-cup, glass measuring container filled and simmering in the microwave.  As soon as the water for your icing bottles, chills, remove the cold water and put in the warmer water.<br /><br />Be cautious to not heat the bottles too much.  If you do, the color will run out and not in a small flow.<br /><br />Sometimes I use Wilton's sparkly colored sugars.  Apply them while the icing is still wet.  When doing that, you will get a pastel shade by using the white icing, but if you want an intense color, use the same color Wilton icing as that of the sugar.<br /><br />This is an excellent product for children and adults.  The results will make you proud of your baked goods.

review/summary: So easy!
review/text: This icing is so easy to use and just a quick time in the microwave lasts for an hour plus. It definitely lasts for longer than one-two dozen cookies if you use it as decoration icing, as opposed to covering the whole cookie. I make my own glacee icing to cover the cookie and then use this to do letters, outlines, designs, etc. so I don't have to bother with an icing bag and to ensure cleaner piping. Knocked it down one star because it is pricey, but you're paying to save time and effort.

review/summary: Make your own!
review/text: I bought this in white and black.<br />It was $10 for both when I got them. Ran off the sides of the cookies and looked horrible.<br />Then I made my own royal icing. Less than $10 with plenty of product to spare for a later date.<br />1 cup powdered sugar<br />1/4 tsp almond extract<br />2 tsp light corn syrup<br />2 tsp milk<br />Mix sugar and milk. Then beat in the others. Add more corn syrup or a splash of milk if its too thick. More sugar if its too thin.<br /><br />I put it in a ziplock bag and cut off a tip for piping. It dried hard. MUCH better than wasting money on the Wilton. Worked very well too :)<br /><br />I can't think of anything I will be able to use my opened bottles of this for. I wish I could return them. The homemade icing is easy and works MUCH better. Use food coloring and get it different colors. I love the Wilton gel ones! So vibrant!

review/summary: awful and runny
review/text: I bought several colors of this and they were all awful. They were very runny. No need to heat, as directions said. We tried to draw decorations and they just ran off the sides. The cookies were even a little cold from being in the fridge. We tried cooling the icing too for a couple hours and that didn't help.The blue icing looked a little greesy and separated, after shaking it for serveral minutes.

review/summary: Very runny, tip too large for outlines or writing
review/text: I bought this product hoping it would be useful for outlining and decorating cookies but the dispenser is too big and there's very little control in how much icing comes out and the end result is a very sloppy design. It's actually great for flooding (filling in the already outlined space). The frosting is also very runny and that's without microwaving it as the directions say. I will stick to my homemade royal icing with a white coloring for a much better outcome.

review/summary: Not for cookies
review/text: This is very misleading. If you read up on it the Wilton website admits this is will not harden and is not recommended for cookies that you will stack. Why call it cookie icing? It is runny and very difficult to work with. I have heard that Royal Icing is the best because it hardens and is easy for piping, decorating, and using as a 'glue' for candies.

review/summary: Great work and on the go tea
review/text: I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.

review/text: The packaging is great for a gift.  The teabags are pyramidal in shape.  As far as taste, if you're just looking for a tea that tastes like vanilla, then this Tazo brand will do it for you. If you're looking for rooibos tea with the pure rooibos taste, then the addition of vanilla at least in this brand of tea, Tazo, will disappoint you.  The raw rooibos taste, without these "improvements" such as vanilla, is full-bodied and has its own unique taste.  I found myself being drawn more to the pure rooibos teas from Twinings, Republic of Tea, and Numi.

To my dissapointment I thought this tea was disgusting!<br /><br /> Luckily, I didn't give up and tried other brands (Numi and Yogi are great) of rooibos and they were all fantastic.  This tea has a stale vanilla taste that completely covers up the natural flavor of rooibos.  Stay away from this tea.  Plain rooibos without added flavors is perfect on it's own.

Normally I buy the Rishi brand since I can find it locally (for a very hefty price), but when I saw the Numi Jasmine Pearls on Amazon I had to try it, especially with the substantial price difference ($21 for 6oz Rishi, $28 for 16oz Numi).<br /><br />This tea is wonderful. It's aroma both pre-and post-steeping is delightful, the flavor is very nice and smooth.<br /><br />I don't think this is the best jasmine pearl tea available, but for the price, it's one that I will buy again.

The tea is very light and subtile yet strongly jasmine. Then there's the flowering effect. This is my favorite bloom of them all. All these tiny little tea balls slowly unwind, dancing under water, swimming and growing until the pot is full of delightful little flowers. Absolute perfection.\<br /><br />And it's good for your body and the planet. :o)

review/text: After much experimenting, I'm a totally devoted fan of Rishi Teas but I make one exception and Numi's Jasmine Pearls is it.  Jasmine pearl tea is my favorite tea, hands down, but as any jasmine pearl lover knows, it ain't cheap!  This tea is a great value AND tastes good.  I defy anyone to find a better deal on GOOD jasmine pearl tea!<br /><br />9-30-09<br />I'm dropping my rating to 3-4 stars.  I've been drinking Rishi Tea's version of jasmine pearls recently.  I just opened a new bag of Numi's jasmine pearls when the Rishi ran out.  The difference in fragrance is dramatic!  I can barely discern any jasmine aroma if any when I opened the Numi bag.  The Numi tea tastes good, even sweet (did they sneak in a hint of sweetener??) but this is jasmine tea after all.  I think I'll bite the bullet and pay the extra $$ in the future for Rishi's jasmine pearl.

I enjoy having a genuine jasmine experience  at a more affordable price.  My first order came with individually wrapped servings (about a teaspoon in each plastic package, which you have to cut open to put the loose tea in your cup).  This is no longer the case.  I drink this tea iced (sorry, authentic tea lovers).  It is just healthier and more soothing for me than other drinks.  It is affordable enough to share with friends, who are always amazed.  I wouldn't be without it.  Excellent value for the price.

review/text: I have loved this tea for years but the most recent purchase has been somewhat disappointing.  The tea leaves are bigger and more ragged, not the young leaves that used to be used.  The jasmine aroma is still there and a few flower petals still appear but now after I steep a tablespoon of pearls maybe one or two petals are floating when there used to be more.  Overall the tea is less fragrant and less delicate.  It's still good, just not what it once was.  I've moved on to a different brand, and that's sad because this was always my favorite.

review/summary: I drink this tea all the time
review/text: I love this tea.  It has a delicate flavor and fabulous aroma.  It is VERY economical, but you have to be careful how you steep it.  Many people like to put in 20 or more pearls, so as to get a strong aroma, but that makes a bitter tea.  All you need are 4-6 pearls per large mug, and the pearls can be re-used about 4 times before needing to be refreshed.  Many green teas which are bagged and made from broken or crushed leaves can get bitter very quickly, and have to be watched during steeping so as not to over steep, but with these whole leaf pearls you can leave them in the water for a good amount of time, I'd say they only really get bitter after about 1/2 hour or so, which is amazing because green tea bags can only be steeped about one minute before they get bitter.  My whole family loves this tea.  And because they are pearls you get the advantage of having loose tea without the disadvantage of needing paraphernalia to steep it.

review/text: First, this tea smells like synthetic jasmine. Purely chemical induced. Secondly, once you let the tea sit and become room temperature, it begins to change its smell to something like urine. I hate to leave such a poor rating, especially saying that it smells like urine, but what else can I do? I love jasmine and drink it solely, everyday, but this is probably the worst tea I have purchased. I guess you have to look at it this way. If you're going to pay such a small price, compared to a pound of tea elsewhere, then you can assume that the saying you get what you pay for is going probably be true. In my opinion, it is in this case.

review/summary: Great value
review/text: Not the best tea that I have had, but much better than any other one that I have been able to find in the US.  This tea has a lot of Jasmine scent that continues to give through multiple steeps.  When the pearls unfurl you can see that the leaves are very fresh. Also the tea is powerful enough that you do not need very many beads per cup.<br /><br />One issue I have is that when steeping there will be little particles that come off. It is not a terribly large amount, however it is more than the better teas.  The other issue I have is that when opening and closing this bag to get the tea, you're letting in and out a lot of air, reducing the potency. You should put a certain amount for your daily use into an airtight container to reduce the # of times you open the bag.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very good value and I do recommend it to anyone, and everyone, that enjoys tea.  Since it is in bulk, spread the joy by sharing with friends and family.

review/text: I would recommend it. Quality pearls and a few make a strong, tasty tea. I have bought the Numi Loose Leaf ones which is cheaper, but it's not worth the saving. Buy this one and you will have quality, aromatic tea.

review/summary: Perfect Start to Each Day
review/text: After living in Beijing where I could find enough amazing quality loose leaf tea to drown myself in, I returned to the US to be sorely disappointed at the lack of diversity and quality in my area.  After searching through Amazon, I found one brand (that shall remain nameless), that was rated, and priced, above the rest.  Then I stumbled upon Numi Jasmine Pearls Tea! For the price, I thought I would give it a go, and I must say the tea exceeds my expectations.  First of all, a whole pound for the price is very reasonable.  As soon as the bag is opened, the wonderful smell of Jasmine wafts up towards you. Unlike the 1T that Numi recommends, I use half that for my 10oz tea mug ([....]) and can steep it twice.  The taste is smooth and very enjoyable.  Would highly recommend!

review/text: This tea is fresh and tastes great. It's right on par with quality of Jasmine Pearls found at specialty stores. Bonus: At $43, nearly half the price of what you'll find in those stores. Sample the style first at your local store and if you like the flavor, buy it here in bulk. That pound goes a long way.

review/text: This tea is amazing. Look no further for high-quality jasmine pearl tea. I bought mine from Amazon in December of 2007 and I'm less than 75% of the way through the bag now, over two years later. I am extremely surprised that the tea has stayed fresh this long. Will order again later this year once it runs out. I just throw half a dozen or so balls in a cup of water and it opens up and sinks to the bottom. So no need for bags here! Highly recommended!

review/text: We discovered this seasoning around 1999 when we moved to Pensacola. Hard to find in northern grocery stores but happy to see it available thru Amazon!  Since moving back up north, every time we visit the south, we buy at least a half dozen cans of this stuff to hold us for a while ;-)  Forget the regular version - you have to use "More Spice" to really get good seasoning without too much salt. Great on just about everything - meats, veggies, pizza, eggs, burgers, soups, and on and on (not sure about ice cream although I can't say I've tried it - yet ;-)  If you're only going to have one seasoning on the table or by the stove, it's got to be Tony's More Spice!<br />Peace & blessings,<br />Donn

review/summary: Hot & Salty
review/text: This is my ideal popcorn seasoning.  I love the spicey pepper mix, but be aware that this stuff is also incredibly salty.<br /><br />Hotness: very mild; (for comparison I consider <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0004LZSYS">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red 12 oz.</a> to be mild)<br /><br />Saltyness: very salty; treat this like pure salt and you won't be surprised.<br /><br />My standard spice test is to put some in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004CP74Z8">Top Ramen Noodles Chicken 3 oz. (12-Pack)</a>.  The pepper side of this spice works great there, but the extra salt piled on top of Ramen's already salty flavor packet makes for a VERY salty dish.<br /><br />Definitely try this first to help you gauge it's effect before serving.  The saltiness will likely be surprising.  Once you know about the salt, though, it's pretty easy to use this tasty spice to good effect.<br /><br />If you don't want any salt, try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KRUEO0">Slap Ya Mama Cajun Seasoning White Pepper Blend 8 oz</a>.  It's not the same pepper taste, but it's similar.

review/text: I like spicy food and find this is not very spicy. A nice cayenne bite, I'd like it to be a bit more hot. This version has less salt than the original, but it's still very salty, which means you can't keep shaking it on to make it hotter or you'll end up with your food way to salty. While I like the product, I think using two different spices, one salty and one hot, will allow you to better flavor your food.

For me, if it's "seasoned to perfection", the salt is absolutely choking.  If I sprinkle it with the right amount of salt, I can't taste the seasoning flavors.<br /><br />If this is supposed to be lower in salt, just imagine what the regular stuff will be!<br /><br />I won't be buying this again.

review/text: I agree with Taysha. They advertise these as "Ultra-strength" when they actually have significantly less ginger taste than the original ginger chews. The texture kind of reminded me of a hard candy that sat in my grandparents candy bowl for years until it was soft. But, as already mentioned, the lower rating is simply because they have a very mild ginger taste. If you like ginger chews for the taste of ginger, definitely get the regular kinds.

review/summary: Good
review/text: The Ginger People brand is among the best I have tried. This variety is not very hot/spicy compared to the crystallized ginger they sell. Small candies individually wrapped are like taffy, with a little punch from some bits of ginger. Not my favorite, as I like a strong ginger effect, but good for those who want more of a candy. Start off a little harder to chew, but soon start to warm up and dissolve in your mouth, so they go quicker than the chews, which have a stronger ginger flavor than these. The Crystallized is the strongest, but is more of a jelly-like consistency. Advertised as The Traveler's Candy, but the wrapper is a bit harder to open than I would like, especially when driving.

They have the Ginger Chews gelly type if that is what you are looking for you can order them here.  I've been looking for these for ages, as they work so well for nausea.  They are not so intense that they cause stomach issues, like heart burn, or bothersome to an ulcer.  They just have the right amount of ginger to be medicinal and not overwhelming.  I am a huge fan, and just wish they weren't so expensive and hard to find locally.

review/text: The Melitta pods fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002XK0CU8">Melitta One:One</a> (single shot maker) and also the Juan Valdez. The pods are slightly smaller in size than the Senseo (made by Douwe Egbert) but similar in size.<br /><br />The coffee is a somewhat acidic, Central American blend and is flavored with a very nice hazelnut aroma. I am not a huge fan of flavored coffee, but this is by far one of their best and actually improves the coffee, overriding the acidity of the coffee itself with the sweetness of hazelnut. I find it doesn't need sugar (it isn't actually sweet, just smells sweet) but you may prefer some cream or sugar in yours.<br /><br />The Melitta is not as prevalent a brand as the Senseo but I purchased one on sale for my office to offer coffee to guests, and it's been very useful. You can run water through it with no pod (make some herb tea or cocoa) and there are tea pods for the unit that make good tea. The hazelnut is really great and we like keeping it on hand for our guests.

review/summary: Coffee is fine, unfortunately 4 of 18 pods were ripped
review/text: The coffee is nice in my hamilton beach senseo machine here in the office.  Unfortunately, in the first box of 18 individual pods, 4 were torn at the seam and were unusable.  I will see how the second box of 18 looks but if it has the same problems I will canceled by subscription order.  Stay tuned for an update.

review/summary: Not recommended for Senseo coffee makers
review/text: The pods work with my Senseo coffee maker but not as well as I had hoped. If you only want a tiny cup of coffee, it is great, but one cannot add two pods at one time in the Senseo and great a today's normal sized cup of coffee.<br />The taste is not that good either.

review/summary: Great Hazelnut Coffee by the single cup!
review/text: Haxelnut Creme is the same great coffee that Melitta sold as Go Hazelnuts! for years.  It makes a great single cup, or you can use the coffe in two pods in a regular filter to make a great 10-cup pot of coffee.

The current picture (brown box) does not accurately represent the actual coffee that is now being made by Melitta.  This coffee is much stronger than the previous blend.

review/text: First of all the shipping charges are ridiculous.  $10+ to ship something that is 1.5 lbs?  Give me a break.  Second they shipped me the wrong thing, they gave me the flourescent colors, and there is 2 of each color.  I mean why would I want small bottles of 2 of each color?  It would be more cost effective just to buy a big bottle of each.  I am trying the americolors because they seem to get such rave reviews, and I wanted a small sample pack before I went out and blew a ton of money on them.<br /><br />I will be sending them back, and asking them to send me the correct ones that I ordered.  I will check back and let you know how it goes...

review/summary: Perfect for mochas and hot chocolates
review/text: I use this chocolate powder with my Mr. Coffee Latte machine to make near coffee-shop quality mochas at home. I've tried several different chocolates, both sweetened and unsweetened (with sugar or Splenda), and this stuff produces by far the best-tasting result I've found so far. I like that it's already sweetened perfectly, so that I have one less ingredient to try to get just right in the morning.<br /><br />It also makes exceptional hot chocolates - be sure to use steamed or frothed milk as the base, not water.<br /><br />Buying this powder from the manufacturer's website in a tiny canister with a tinier sealed 9 oz bag stuffed inside is a complete ripoff and joke (I did that only once to simply try it out first), but this 3-lb bag is convenient and lasts a while, plus the pricing on Amazon very affordable. I plan to use the "subscribe & save" feature as soon as my first bag is gone and I figure out the ideal frequency for my needs.

review/summary: It's Fondarific!
review/text: Love this stuff, very easy to work with and reasonably priced. The Wilton stuff is like rubber and hard to roll out thin enough. I had no trouble with this. It also was not too sticky which was the problem I ran into when I used the Duff stuff. So far this is the best fondant I have used. It really doesn't dry out so if you want your pieces to stiffen up quickly or become completely hard you will need to mix in gumtex or gumpaste to accomplish that. I love this stuff. The black color was truely jet black too.

review/text: I only gave this 3 stars because I used this fondant for my daughters birthday cake and though it's very easy to roll out it was almost tooo pliable. I made a decorative bow for the top and wouldn't hold up in the heat. Kept falling down and loosing it's shape. It's great though for making flat shapes to stick on a cake, cupcakes, etc.

review/text: This was my first go at fondant.  It turned out to be really easy with Fondarific and tasted great.  I made black cow spots and a black bow for my son's birthday cake.  Loved it.  I also love that it has a 1 year shelf life.  I was having trouble rolling out the fondant at first, but I realized I was working with fondant that was too warm.  Once I cut down microwave time to 4-5 seconds, it worked much better.

review/summary: Fondarific.......I agree!!!!!
review/text: I will preface this review with the fact that I'm a novice when it comes to fondant.<br /><br />With that being said, my husband and I resorted to doing cupcakes for our son's birthday party after we realized that no bakery around us made Pokemon themed anything.  After watching "Cake Boss" and "Ace of Cakes" a couple of times, I have to admit I was a little hesitant to even try working with fondant.  However, my husband and I found working with Fondarific relatively easy.  The coloring was exactly as it shown on the site.  It came with additional information with directions for working with hardened fondant, storage and shelf life after being opened.  I will say just a couple of seconds in the microwave does wonders for fondant.  Though it makes it a little bit sticky for a short period of time.<br /><br />End result......everything turned out great.  Everyone at the party thought they were professionally done. (Even had a couple of people ask my husband and I for our business card).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this fondant to anyone!!! Easy to work with and tastes great!!!

review/text: I am a professional baker and will make my own "plain" fondant.  It's actually pretty easy, like making a dough.<br />I, however, hate mixing black as it takes so many colors to get it to be a true black color.  So, I always buy the black fondant.  Trust me - it will save you a lot of aggravation! I found this brand to be very easy to work with too.

review/summary: Birthday cakes
review/text: Having made specialty cakes throught the years for family events this was my first time using fondant frosting. My oldest granddaughter and her best friend turned 16 on the same day, and planned a big party, 125+ people were invited. The theme was black and white with silver accents. I made two full sheet cakes designed for each girl. My granddaughters was frosted with white fondant with black ribbon trim and silver beaded accenting, and her friends was black overall fondant with white ribbon trim with black sugar as the accent. I made a rememberance bouquet for each girl using the theme colors, accented with flowers in each girls favorite colors. These were the main decoration on each cake. It was quite an experience, but fun. It was nice to be able to purchase the frosting in this large quantity for such a good price.

review/summary: Not the 70's Kind
review/text: Whether you like this candy or not depends a lot on why you are buying it.<br /><br />If you are older like me and looking for the red licorice that was once sold in Department Store Candy Counters and Candy stores by the bunch in the sixties and seventies then you will be disappointed. This is not even remotely similar to that candy.<br /><br />Until eight years ago our Mall Candy Store sold the original red licorice laces but they replaced it with the kind that tastes like Twizzlers in the form of a string. I have been looking to no avail for the original variety ever since. This order was my last hope and it seems the kind many of us grew up with simply isn't being made anymore.<br /><br />Personally I did not really care for the taste but that means nothing since I was looking for the kind they use to sell and this wasn't it.<br /><br />If anyone does know who sells the original type I wish they would tell me.
