review/summary: Engineered for Runners, Cyclists and Athletes of all types...
review/text: As a distance runner, I have been a dedicated user of Cytomax since 1994. It's smooth, tastes great and delivers an even dose of the right blend of carbohydrates to help sustain energy levels. More importantly, it doesn't leave me with a "sugar crash" the way that some other popular name brands do.<br /><br />The effect of Cytomax and reduction of perceived exertion/lactic acid buildup is evident anytime; however, it is most pronounced during summertime, when the body is working harder during longer training sessions. I would recommend following the product's directions to consume this before, during and after the training periods to obtain maximum effect.<br /><br />Before the advent of the Internet and E-Commerce, I had tried others that were popular and commercially available, when I could not obtain Cytomax. Even recently, I obtained a sample of the EAS equivalent, which was highly touted. The bottom line is that all else pales in comparison to this product.

review/summary: Cytomax, a runners best friend.
review/text: I have been using Cytomax regularly for about six years now.  I cannot preach the benefits of this product enough.  It really does beat the burn.  The percieved exertion levels, the lowering of lactic acid levels in muscle and the subsequent enhanced recovery are all truly part of the package.  I frequently use it before bed when I know I will only have a limited time to sleep (i.e. 3-5 hrs) and have found that I will have deep restful sleep and awake feeling invigorated.  It is also a handy hangover drink according to some of my past roomates.  I have been encouraging other fellow runners, triathletes, cyclist, backpackers, mountaineers, etc to try the product and have recieved similiar feedback.  Many nice climbing/outdoor gear shops have the individual packets available if you wanted to demo the product.

review/summary: Bring back Cytomax Classic!!!
review/text: Remember when Coke came out with their new formula. It was a disaster for them. The company finally relented and brought back the original formula after losing significant market share. This is the same situation. I have been using this drink for years (Cool Citrus and Tropical Fruit) and I have been very happy with it. I am even subscribed to these mixes through Amazon's subscription program. I am ending those subscriptions and I'm not getting this stuff anymore. I recently received 4.5 pounds of Cool Citrus through the subscription program and didn't know that they changed the formula until I went on my ride and took my first few sips -- YUK!!! An excellent description another reviewer used to describe this stuff. The graphics on the packaging has changed with a small caption "Now with Stevia". I mixed 2 scoops with 24 ounces of water just like I used to except now this stuff with Stevia tastes like a rotten grapefruit. Maybe I'm mixing it too strong, but this is the amount stated on the label. I don't know the reason the old formula was abandoned. Did it contain potentially banned substances or dangerous ingredients? I hope not, but I know I can't stand the new formula. I would give the old formula 5 stars, but this stuff isn't worthy.

review/summary: Not an improvement
review/text: I'm not sure when Cytomax changed their formula, but in regards to taste it was a huge step backwards. The old Tangy Orange was smooth and satisfying with no aftertaste. The newer version leaves a sharp aftertaste in the back of the throat long after is is consumed. Not sure if the addition of Stevia is the cause. I just can't drink it like I used to and now choke it down like all the other nasty sports drinks that are so common. Also the addition of caffeine to Tangy Orange was a surprise. I don't like to consume added stimulants as they just don't work for me and lead to GI distress on the trail. Also what's up with all the foam after shaking it up in the water bottle? Cytomax has been so good to me over the years and I'm disappointed that this version has become more unpalatable. I used to give Cytomax 5 stars, now just 2 stars.

review/summary: New formula - Yuk!
review/text: Unbeknownst to me, the new formula was shipped to me. I used to love this stuff. It worked great and tasted palatable. I usually use less powder than what they recommend since I need a lot more water than other people. Now they've used stevia as the sweetening agent and the product is bitter and nasty tasting. It was so bad I thought the batch was off and was going to return it as defective! Then I saw the mention of stevia on the label. Oh...that explains it.  That stuff doesn't taste sweet at all. It's worse than old school saccharin. Also they lowered the amount of calcium and changed other ingredients. It sounds like they reformulated to reduce costs. I can't use this rubbish. I want my money back and I'll have to try something else.

review/summary: Definitely reduces cramping while giving you energy
review/text: I've been using Cytomax while bicycling for about 10 years and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Before Cytomax, I mainly used Gatorade and I would often get very painful leg cramps on long rides, especially on hot days. Since switching to Cytomax, I get cramps only occasionally, usually when I'm not drinking enough.<br /><br />I mix 1.5 measures of Cytomax in a 24 ounce water bottle, which is less than the recommended amount. Some of the reviewers have mentioned that Cytomax doesn't dissolve easily, but if you should not have a problem if you add the Cytomax to a bottle that is half filled with water so that it doesn't clump, then shake the bottle vigorously, and then add water to fill the bottle. Before drinking give the bottle a few shakes to distribute anything that's settled to the bottom.<br /><br />Taste is the most important thing when selecting an energy drink. Whatever your choice, it doesn't have to taste great, but it does have to be acceptable. If you don't like the taste, then you probably won't be drinking enough and your performance will definitely suffer as a result. I use the Cool Citrus flavor. Over the years, I've gotten samples of other flavors, some of which were OK and some that I did like at all. So if you're unsure about the flavor, try to get a sample from someone before you buy a 1.5 or 4.5 pound container.<br /><br />On long rides, I carry two bottles on my bike. For very long rides, I'll also carry zip lock bags with measured amounts of Cytomax so I can refuel as needed.<br /><br />In Summary: A great product.

review/summary: Easy on the stomach, tastes great
review/text: I bought Cytomax as fuel for a 50K (31 mile) run I went on.  Gatorade is rough on my stomach, even when I dilute it, but I had no problem with the Cytomax full strength.  It's thicker than most sports drinks, a lot more like drinking juice.  I thought it tasted great, but the important thing was being able to stomach it on the long haul.<br /><br />It was noticeably helpful.  I did one six mile loop without a drink along from miles 15-21, and I crashed for the last 2 miles of that loop.  Some Cytomax and Oreos and I was recovered and ready to pick the pace back up in 15 min.

review/text: I've been using a tub of the tangy orange flavor for the last 6 months and its been great. Pretty good flavor, no bad aftertaste, seems to have performance and recovery benefits.<br /><br />I ordered tropical fruit the other day and I'm not sure what to think. I read a review that said some flavors taste like soap. I didn't believe this, but here I sit, with a soapy aftertaste in my mouth. I'm not sure I want my mouth to taste like soap 50 miles into a bike ride.<br /><br />This new batch is CytoSport's new formula with Stevia. I don't know if the tropical fruit flavor tastes bad, or if the new formula tastes bad, but its certainly terrible. I don't think stevia tastes like soap, so I'm confused about the flavor.<br /><br />Please fix this CytoSport, I wanted to be a fan.

review/summary: Great until they added Stevia
review/text: As a marathoner, century cyclist, and half-ironman triathlete, I've used my fair share of sports mixes.  I've been a faithful Cytomax user for several years and find that it helps me feel less sore after hard training and is easy on my stomach.  However, I noticed that my most recent bottle of Cytomax states that it includes "Stevia".  Stevia has only recently been approved by the FDA and is still not approved in Europe, and is not, as it is frequently marketed, always a natural product.  The plant itself is natural, but when used as a sweetener it needs to be treated and "messed with" to make it sweet and mask it's bitterness.  It's safety has also been debated, and given the large quantities of sports drink that I consume, that's enough for me to switch products.

review/summary: Best Flavor, little Salt
review/text: There is a misunderstanding of what drinks should include and that can be best answered by choosing the drink that best suits your sport.  Long distance, high intensity sports need calories, salts and proteins. Weekenders rarely need calories and salts, unless they live in a high humidity area and sweat considerably.  Salts should include potassium, calcium but little sodium.  Sugars in the form of glucose or sucrose should be added but not to excess.  Stay away from corn syrups and corn additives. Having said all that, most drinks that are low in sodium salts, and neutral on calories (sugars/proteins) will provide enough nutritive additions to you while you exercise.  Keep in mind that one of the reasons you exercise is to loose weight.  If you add a bunch of calories while your exercising, your weight loss will be for naught. Stay away from sugar bars and  caffeine unless your a long distance runner and or cyclist. This CytoSport drink is a good choice for the average sportive  who does not need to supplement their diet on a routine basis.  It is also good for the high intensity sportive when they also supplement their diets with high energy food while they exercise.

review/summary: THE sports drink
review/text: I have been using this product for several years since I discovered it on Amazon.  I have GERD (esophageal reflux disease) and I can't drink formulations that either have too much sugar or too much acid.  This drink does not set me off like some of the other flavors do.  I has a very pleasant apple flavor, that you swear is real apple juice.  I usually mix two measuring cups (included) into a 70oz Camelback and place it into the fridge for my next day's ride.  The drink will stay cool for two hours.  This product does have sugars, although not much.  It has about 90 calories per measure, which is enough for a good ride around town.  If you are a marathoner, then you will need more calories and may need to suppliment your drink with power bars.  But this is enough for us casual riders.  If you don't want the calories, then you can decrease your measurements accordingly.  This is the only drink for me and I hope they never take it off the market.

review/summary: How To Not Cramp
review/text: PROS:<br />- Works to prevent cramps from lactic acid.<br />- Tastes good.<br />- Dissolves easily.<br />- Lower sodium than other electrolyte products.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- More expensive than water.<br />- Heavier to carry than electrolyte pills.<br /><br />As an avid athlete for the past 30 years (mountain biker, long distance trail runner, backpacker), I didn't need an electrolyte replacement supplement until I was diagnosed with congenital hypertension and had to take a diuretic along with BP meds. The diuretic did me in on hot, sunny days during a long run or long mountain bike ride. U suffered cramps from built-up lactic acid in my muscles, a new experience for me. I could no longer run 10 miles or mountain bike 20-25 miles without replenishing my electrolytes. Even eating every half hour with water didn't cut it.<br /><br />Enter CytoMax, which I initially received as a freebie at triathlons and races. What a difference! It works great! During the summer, I'll bring along a water bottle filled with CytoMax. Its sodium content is lower than other electrolyte drinks. Its taste is easy to swallow and refreshing, unlike some of the others, too. I haven't suffered another cramp since I started using CytoMax. As recommended by the manufacturer, I drink it 30 min into my activity, and then sip it every so often till it's gone.<br /><br />I've not have a single problem with dissolving or clumping using this technique. The night before, I add about 1/4 cup of chilled water to my water bottle. I add 2 scoops Cytomax. I add more chilled water to make 14 oz fluid. Shake ~30 sec. Refrigerate overnight. The CytoMax granules completely dissolve, leaving no residue using this method. The next morning, if it's hot & sunny, I might add a few ice cubes before I hit the trails.<br /><br />BOTTOMLINE: It works. It tastes good. I'd buy it again.

Every 32oz of water I use 3 scoops of cytomax and then I ad 1 TBSP of sugar (2 if you want it super sweet).  Hope it helps you too.

review/summary: Terrible new version of what was a good product
review/text: It is always a huge disappointment when a product that you have relied on for years destroys its merits in search of a new image. Cytomax has ruined a good product with the "remake" it has imposed on its product line. It is now made with an artificial sweetener (Stevia) and has a quite different taste and different nutritional values. I will not buy this new version.

review/summary: New formula includes caffeine
review/text: I bought 2 jugs of the 'new' Grape Cytomax. I read the ingredients information on the Amazon site, but when I went to use the product I now notice that it has a different formula and includes CAFFEINE. Some people like that. Others do not. Regardless, this should be clearly disclosed by Amazon. It is not. I can't comment on the taste as with caffeine I have dumped out the product - I don't want that for myself or my family.

Only drawback is that I notice it clumps if you use too much ice.

review/summary: Really helps me - 42 year old weekend warrior
review/text: I'm a bit out of shape and getting back into shape hasn't been easy with all the soreness. A friend recommended Cytomax and it has really helped. While exercising I can do more reps than in the past and when I get 6 or 7 sets deep into my workout my reps only fall off slightly compared to before I was trying Cytomax. The other day I did a workout that I'd done 2 weeks before but this time I did not use Cytomax and the soreness that I am experiencing today is unpleasant to say the least. My experiment showed me that without using Cytomax I get considerable soreness the following day(s) whereas when I did use Cytomax I had relatively little soreness. Until I get back in shape I think I'm going to need this crutch. I'm 42 years old so that means that I experience a lot more soreness than a younger athlete. Someone younger and in better shape may not notice such a difference.

review/summary: Does what it's supposed to do, and does it effectively.
review/text: I'm not an endurance cyclist/runner, but I was pointed to this by one. I was looking for a carbohydrate/electrolyte product more effective than Gatorade, mainly for lifting, and occasionally cardio-intensive sports.<br /><br />I don't have any grand insight to offer, but can vouch that it does what it's supposed to do. I'm able to work out longer (~2 hours on a consistent basis) without experiencing symptoms of dehydration now, than when I didn't take this and either drank only water, or water and Gatorade (feeling mild nausea + dizziness past ~1.5 hours).<br /><br />It should also be noted that there's drastically less sugar/sodium per gram of carbs in this than Gatorade. This might not be important to everybody, but another of the reasons I wanted an alternative to Gatorade is that sodium is a migraine trigger for me.<br /><br />Cool Citrus tastes like soap, Tropical Fruit tastes like shampoo. Both of these tastes are mild, and between them I prefer the Tropical Fruit.

review/summary: Great Product ... poor followthrough by Seller
review/text: I have used several energy/recovery/hydration drinks in the past (Gatorade, Heed, etc.), and Cytomax seems to provide the best solution for me.  I play soccer regularly and am older (in my 50's).  Since moving to Phoenix I have found that I am pretty much nutrient starved and dehydrated by the end of play and suffer from lactic acid build up.  The night I play and the next day take their toll on me.  I've found that these effects are greatly reduced if I drink Cytomax during and shortly after play.  For post recovery I usually take in 30 to 40 grams of protein (muscle milk or protein powders) and find this definitely reduces post-exercise "pain."  I believe in this product. It also keeps my energy level up as I play.<br /><br />However, I recently purchased Cytomax from Direct Supercenter.  I made the purchase on May 2.  On May 9, I received a note from Amazon that no shipment had yet been made.  I contacted the seller through Amazon asking about shipment and an expected delivery date, only to get a request asking about my experience in purchasing the product.  Okay ... two-and-a-half  weeks later, still no word from the seller about shipping, so I finally cancelled the order (May 18). This is a common product.  I am greatly dissatisfied with the seller and will no longer conduct business with them.  As for Cytomax, I think it's a great product.

Been using it for over a month now on a regular basis and really love it.<br />Have tried the GoGrape and Tangy Orange (I think that's the name) and the orange one has a stronger flavor in that the flavor is more present.  The GoGrape is a little less present.  They're both tasty though.  With the orange I use 1 scoop for training and the recommended 2 scoops for races and flavor is great - 1 scoop doesn't taste weak or watered down (despite actually being watered down).  With grape, unless I use 2 scoops it tastes weak.

review/text: I use this every time I go to the gym. It's one of the better tasting powders and it allows me to drink coffee (which I like), for caffeine, and then rely on this Cytomax for energy throughout the workout, plus ease the acid build-up in the muscles that can make you want to puke. Make leg and intense workouts easier. I don't see the point in having the caffeine in the drink when the caffeine will not really get into the system until your workout is almost done. I tend to drink some caffeine half an hour before the workout and then use the Cytomax during the workout.

review/summary: Taste Good, Not Filling
review/text: The one thing that I look for in a drink is that it tastes good.  I know you take that for granted when you buy anything that has flavor, but I have purchased some drinks that taste like swamp water, or worse.  All of the Cytomax drinks that I have tried taste good.  Now some exercise aficionado's will swear that you need this ingredient or that protein in your drinks.  For most weekend warriors and part-time athletes all you need is a good replacement drink without a lot of salt.  Being a heart patient, I need to restrict salt in my diet. While there is still quite a bit of sodium in this drink, it is not overpowering and doesn't stay with you when you stop exercising. A little bit of salt in your drinks goes a long ways.  The Cytomax company may not be as famous as some of the big boy's, but I have used they're products for 20 years and swear by them.  And I think you will too. The other great flavor is apple.  I really like that one.

I suspected it was do to acidification of the muscles moving into the blood stream. I did some research and found cytomax. I don't think it tastes very bad at all, if you don't like it, try a different flavor. I start drinking it about 30 minutes before workout on an empty stomach, and it seems to assimilate into the blood quickly.<br /><br />I've definitely noticed that workouts are less painful, more productive and I don't get sick to my stomach anymore. This is one product that delivers on it's promises and then some.

review/summary: Cytomax is very misleading in stating and not stating ingredients
review/text: I just canceled an order for Cytomax because after researching it more on various sites, including their own, I find Cytomax to be very misleading concerning ingredients in their product.  I contacted their customer service department and the words "herbal lift" mean caffeine.  Why don't they just say what it is....caffeine?  Why do they hide the fact that certain flavors have caffeine in them?  Reason:  Some people won't buy sports drinks with caffeine in them.....me being one of those people.  Some flavors contain guarana extract.  Look it up...it has a very high caffeine content.  In summary, I simply don't trust Cytomax as a company.  If I have to search for the truth, it's the same as them not telling the truth to me.  To try to bring my impressions to conclusion, I called Cytomax on the number listed on their website and their customer service people are very evasive or not able to address my questions about what is in their product to back up their anecdotal evidence listed on their website.  They transferred me to their sales manager who is an "avid cyclist", got voicemail and no return phone call.  If you want to know what you're really putting in your body, don't buy Cytomax.

Liked recent changes in formula, which made product more citrus tasting, less sweet, a common complaint among fellow cyclists who don't use Cytomax.  Well, that changed when the manufacturers decided to add ACS along with an amino acid peptide blend containing whey.  For whatever reason, the product is much more sweet than the prior formula, perhaps to offset the dairy flavor imparted by the whey.  Who knows?<br /><br />I'm considering trying something else and would encourage the manufacturer to go back to the previous formula.  As I result, I'm cancelling my Amazon order subscription, not to mention the CA sales tax now added to the cost of buying this product from Amazon.

review/summary: Great Grape!
review/text: First I have to say that I have tried many products before Cytomax. But coming out of the gate, it was hands down a good value and a product that could keep me going for hours on my bicycle. I ride around 3500-4000 miles a year, and that isn't always easy at my age. I found this product kept me going throughout the ride and also helps with leg pains more than any other product I have tried. This summer I went on a 100 mile charity ride in 90 degree southern US temperatures and I was amazed at how well I felt at the end of the ride. My long quest for an energy supplement is done. I am about to order my third 4.5 pd jug of Cytomax. I prefer the grape above the other two I have tried (Lemonade, Tropical). I smell the grape before I drink and it makes me smile I think. I certainly drink more water because I enjoy the flavor and anything that helps to remind you to drink more while on the road is a good thing. One last thing that makes Cytomax a good value is that you can dilute the product on the not so hot days, like below 80, when you do not sweat as much. Thereby saving 50% costs of the product and still feel energized. Hope this helps!

review/summary: Love Cytomax
review/text: I've been using Cytomax for a very long time now and still love it.  I mainly use it for weightlifting and it keeps my hydrated and reducing lactic acid burn to allow for a better workout.  The taste of the different flavors is good enough since you're not using this for taste.  By no means is it bad or just tolerable, but if you want taste go for the more mainstream products out there (Gatorade).  I highly recommend this for weight training as it makes a significant different for me.

I've tried many flavors and like the Pomegranate Berry the best, not too sweet.

review/summary: Just try it- you'll never work out agian with out it!!
review/text: I tried this stuff oh 15 years ago when I was hiking, biking, climbing, anything outdoors all the time. I thought it was a great way to stay hydrated and avoid the soreness the day after a good work out.<br /><br />But now that I am in my mid 30's and 5 kids later...I HAVE TO HAVE it!! I make a bowl of oatmeal (using water) before my rides 3 x's a week and instead of adding more water or milk I just put a squirt of the lime citrus in with my water bottle (that is going with me on my ride) and enjoy my pre work out snack. Then I drink it on my 20 mile ride and I have yet to be sore. Not that my muscles aren't "tight" I can tell that I took on some hills, but not sore so I can't use my legs the next day.<br /><br />Just try it. You can always send it back, but if you are serious about working out, sweating, pushing past the burn and tired of FEELING the burn the next day. Just get some. YOu'll be a lifer like me!<br /><br />I ran a relay race last year with 11 other woman who I have hooked on the stuff. Yeah. 11 new Cytomax groupies:)<br /><br />I mix up two scoops in my 24 oz water bottle every ride. I don't like it cold, but my sister (who like the pomegrante something) likes it chilled. To each their own.  Read up on it. It's gooooood stuff and this is the best price I've found for the 4.5 lbs size!<br /><br />Enjoy your work out!!

review/summary: Contains SPLENDA - yuck
review/text: The product description claims "It contains no high-fructose corn syrup in regular flavors and no aspartame in diet flavors." This is true - instead ALL of the 12 sample flavors we got with our machine contain SPLENDA (sucralose), whether "diet" or not! You have to read the fine print to discover this. Prior to reading the fine print, we tried the root beer: hmm, tastes like root beer but with an artificial after-taste. Then the "Dr. Pepper": hmm, tastes like Dr. Pepper but with an artificial after-taste. Checked the fine print: sugar, PLUS SPLENDA. Who would have thought the NON-diet flavors would contain SPLENDA? We threw the remaining 10 sample packs out and will look elsewhere for flavorings that don't sneak artificial sweeteners in - Monin syrups come to mind.

review/text: First, I LOVE the sodastream machines. They work great for sparkly water anytime you need it.<br />The syrups taste good--just like store bought sodas. But, the price for the syrup is insane! Each bottle makes the equilalent of 6 2L bottles of soda. Every supermarket I go to has 2L bottles of soda for $1 regularly--so the store bought equilent is only $6.

If you suffer from migrains (as I do) the artificial sweetener used in the soda syrups will only cause more pain and surprisingly quickly.  There truely needs to be an alternative to the artificial sweetner for this to be a soda substitute.

review/summary: I won't buy it again
review/text: The regular Cola is OK at best.  I bought the Sodastream and was unaware that most of the flavors have acesulfame potassium.  The Cola has a chemical taste which I think is coming from the acesulfame potassium.  I'm not a health food nut but I try to avoid artificial sweeteners.  The sample pack had some good tasting flavors such as Orange, Dr. Pepper, and Root Bear which all tasted as good as anything you buy in the store.  However I'm a cola drinker and the regular cola won't cut it for me.  The Diet Cola is even worse.  I'd like to try the Tonic but the reviews are terrible.  I'm planning on trying the All Natural Cola.  If the Natural Cola does not work I will be selling the Sodastream.  Sodastream is a ingenious idea, but unless they can come up with better cola's I think it will be a passing fad.

review/summary: SULFITES!!!! NOT MENTIONED BUT INCLUDED!!!!
review/text: I have worked for a major retailer for the past 20 years, we sell Soda Stream and all its accessories.  I even performed ALL the product samplings this past 4th quarter.  I bought one for myself.  I like it okay but slowly came to realize that every time I drank the diet cola my face would erupt with cysts that were huge and raw.  I thought it was stress or something else.  I went to an allergist and tested with very strong reaction to "sulfites".  everyone, I mean EVERYONE look at your bottles of syrup and despite all the "healthy" mumbo jumbo find the small print "contains sulfites".  My Dr. told me to stop drinking the soda stream diet cola (I believe all the flavors have sulfites, but I could be wrong) for several weeks.  I complied and stuck with good old Diet Coke.  My face cleared up within a few days and was cyst free.  Them my Dr. instructed me to make a batch of the diet cola in the 1 liter bottle and drink it throughout 1 day.  The next day the cysts were forming again and then progresively got worse.  Stopped using soda stream products completely and have had NO flair ups since.  I would be very careful as sulfites have many bad side effects.  I truly loved the product, its simplicity and sold tons of it because I thought it was great.  Little did I know I was selling something tainted with sulfites.  If you have noticed any strange blisters, cysts or acne do as I did with my Dr.s instructions and see for yourself.  I am male so don't insinuate it was a "monthly menstrual cycle".  BEWARE.

review/text: My family LOVES the sodaStream fizzy water,  and HATES the flavors SodaStream makes-  there is a definite aftertaste of Not-Sugar (sucralose) in the concentrates,  which can trigger migraines in sensitive people (like us).  However,  we have found that mixing the fizzy water with half juice (real cranberry is a favorite, and even the V8 V-Fusion juice blends)  gets us drinking more water and less juice without sacrificing taste. For lightly-flavored waters we do use a small amount of natural flavor extracts (we like McNess- no propylene glycol)  rather than the fruit flavors offered by SodaStream.  Definitely get an extra 2-pack of bottles,  though,  to keep chilled water ready for fizzing in the fridge. The gas cartridge refills  are quite easily found, as well.

Had this firm read my recent reviews they would have seen that I dislike being asked to leave feedback and reviews.  It is unprofessional.<br /><br />The product is just ok, but being hounded to leave reviews/feedback prevents even a three star review.  If I were to buy this product again, and that is very doubtful, I'd go back to buying from a brick and mortar retail store, pay a higher price and sales tax.

review/text: I love the product so far - I think it's a great idea, saves money and saves me from carrying heavy bottles up 3 flights of stairs... but the syrup tastes "off". I would compare the regular flavors to off-brand, diet soda, and I haven't tried the diet flavors yet because I can't imagine that they would taste any better. I can tell that they use Splenda (or something other than real sugar) because the "sweet" taste that's found in most sodas is just not there.<br /><br />All of that aside, most of the flavors DO taste similar their counterparts (Fountain Mist = Mountain Dew, Lemon Lime = Sprite, etc.) I would recommend getting the Variety Pack to find which things you like before you buy a bottle that makes 12 liters.

review/text: I purchased the Soda Stream (Starter Kit)  as a Father's Day gift for my husband. We both enjoy soda water, but there are only a few brands we've found which do not taste "soapy."<br /><br />We've only had it for a week, but this little gadget works as advertised. It is easy and quick  and effective to use, and we all like that we can control the level of "fizz."  I like more, the kids like less. I bought extra bottles and flavorings (for the kids) so everyone could do their own. We use it mostly with filtered water, although the tap water works perfectly well too, as long as you have good tap water.<br /><br />The flavorings will be used  not as much around here, although they seem good and the kids like them.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product. The only caveat I would give at this point, is make sure you want more "gas" in your life.  My entire family is doing a lot more belching and burping than we ever have before, but we like this machine!

review/text: They advertise that they contain 'no aspartame in diet flavors' and boldly state 'no high fructose corn syrup', but the regular flavors contain sucralose artificial sweetners making it taste awful. No disclaimer on the front of the bottle. How can they legally NOT call it DIET if it has artificial sweetners? Anyway, unless you like and can drink diet drinks you will not like 'regular' flavors either.

review/summary: Not ecological
review/text: Sodastream bills itself as an ecological alternative to disposable bottles.  However, if you look at the fine print on the bottles, the syrups are made in Israel.  An item that's mainly water is being shipped half way around the world.  I think that cancels out any eco benefit on this end.

review/summary: Unhealthy ingredients for a healthy drink
review/text: I love my SodaStream seltzer maker.  I purchased the syrup mixes to give my drinks a little flavor.  I was very disappointed with the ingredient list: artificial flavors, sodium benzoate, acesulfame potassium, and Red #40 and Yellow #6.<br /><br />I drink seltzer instead of soda because I want to avoid these artificial ingredients.  These syrup mixes were not worth the money.

review/summary: After taste from nutraSweet Aspartame
review/text: I'm sorry to say even the non diet syrup uses nutrasweet as a sweetener, sadly this makes for a poor taste. I use the original Coke cola Syrup but now having trouble finding it.<br />From the looks of it all SodaStream syrup has Nutrasweet so be warned if you don't enjoy the taste.

review/summary: Tried Many, Some Great, Some Not
review/text: We have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KYT6CS">Sodastream Fountain Jet Soda Maker Starter Kit</a> and picked up a bunch of the flavor syrups to try out. Here are my opinions:<br /><br />Caffeine Free Orange - **** (4/5 Stars) Good flavor, my son likes this one the best<br />Caffeine Free Root Beer - *** (3/5 Stars) Just OK, not our favorite<br />Cola - ** (2/5 Stars) Not very good at all, looking for an alternative<br />Cranberry Raspberry - ***** (5/5 Stars) Great tasting, my daughter and my wife both love this one<br />Diet Ginger Ale - **** (4/5 Stars) Good flavor<br />Diet Lemon Lime - ***** (5/5 Stars) Great tasting<br />Dr. Pete - ***** (5/5 Stars) Great tasting<br />Energy Drink - ***** (5/5 Stars) Great tasting, good energy boost as well<br />Ginger Ale - **** (4/5 Stars) Good flavor<br /><br />These syrups are generally good and the ability to make small amounts of our favorite flavors at home is a real luxury!<br /><br />Recommended, with exception of the disappointing "Cola" flavor.<br /><br />CFH

review/summary: As a Red Bull Enthusiast, I Highly Recommend This!
review/text: This is an excellent, cost-effective alternative to Red Bull.  The flavor is spot on--even though a purist may be able to notice the difference, I was very pleased with how close this comes to the real deal!<br /><br />For the price, two cans of the real stuff almost pays for 12 liters of this.  Also, with this syrup, you have the option to how strong or weak you'd like to make each serving.  I find that I can add less than the recommended amount and make this mix go even further.<br /><br />I think you would be hard-pressed to find a cheaper alternative that tastes so close to the original.

review/summary: Diet Lemon Lime- flavor
review/text: I have tried this flavor and it tastes a lot like Sprite. I like that it has no aspartame. The price on Amazon is Double what you can get these syrups for elsewhere, so I will not buy it here.

review/summary: What Every Consumer Should Know - NOT Economical
review/text: The taste of SodaStream diet cola does not match that of mainstream brands.  This becomes especially noticeable for frequent drinkers of Diet Coke or Diet Pepsi.  Yet that isn't the main problem with the SodaStream offering.  The truth is simply that consumers are paying way too much for C02 refills -- sixteen times (16x) too much.<br /><br />While the general idea of at-home carbonation is solid, consumers should understand that they are grossly overpaying for SodaStream carbon dioxide refills. In fact, the prices charged are sixteen times (16x) wholesale costs or many, many times more expensive than the prices a restaurant would pay. In Europe, frugal consumers are aware of such markups and actually purchase their own restaurant-sized CO2 refills. In the US, we aren't so frugal.<br /><br />Other than the outrageous costs for the CO2 refills, there are other issues with the SodaStream Fountain Jet. One is the construction quality is quite low with very thin molded plastic and little weight. Additionally, the taste of generic soda flavors do not match that of the brand name products.<br /><br />Below is the calculated cost per two liter for the output of SodaStream soda. This includes the cost of the consumables AND the equipment costs. I have used very generous assumptions, including a low discount rate (i.e. cost of money).<br /><br />Transportation costs were not factored because 1) purchases of typical groceries should more or less overlap with soft drink purchases 2) grocery delivery has long been available in many areas 3) most people live closer to a grocery store than to a home furnishings store (I walk 100 ft. for groceries and drive one mile for BB&B) 4) the reverse logistics for the CO2 refills is an extra expense for the retailer that has to be factored into its profit margin and will ultimately be borne by the consumer.<br /><br />One of the reasons Bed Bath & Beyond, Macy's and Crate and Barrel choose to carry SodaStream is that they want the consumer to make MORE FREQUENT trips to their establishments for consumables. Instead of going to such establishments once every 3 to 6 months, customers will now visit once every 1 to 2 months. That makes an enormous difference for generating impulse purchases at such retailers. One could argue then that transportation costs could increase for the individual consumer.<br /><br />Total Costs = $1.73 per Two Liter -- More Expensive Than Retail<br /><br />*Concentrate<br />Flavor cost bottle of concentrate $4.99<br />Liters of product per container 12<br />Flavor/l $0.42<br /><br />*Carbonator<br />Volume of CO2 130<br />Cost of CO2 per refill (130 liters) 29.99<br />CO2 cost per liter $0.23<br /><br />*Sodastream Equipment Costs - Amortization Per Liter<br />Equipment cost $89.00<br />Equipment life (years) 5<br />Discount rate (cost of money) 8%<br />Liters per month 10.00<br />Monthly amortized cost $1.80<br />Cost of equipment per liter $0.18<br /><br />*Water Cost with Brita Filtration<br />Municipal water costs per liter in US $0.0004<br />Brita filter three pack (454 liters of water output) $16.95<br />Brita cost per liter $0.0373<br />Water and filter costs per liter $0.0377<br />(assumes you already own Brita Pitcher so no equipment costs, just incremental filtration)<br /><br />***TOTAL COSTS PER TWO LITER = (Flavor + CO2 + Equipment + Filtered Water) * 2<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.73<br /><br />Without filtered water:<br />SodaStream Total Cost Per Two Liter = $1.65<br /><br />*****What does CO2 Really Cost????<br /><br />THE MATH BELOW IS WHAT SODASTREAM DOESN'T WANT THE CONSUMER TO KNOW<br /><br />*Restaurant Carbonation (note distributor prices, so there is still a distributor profit)<br />weight of CO2 contents of large restaurant CO2 tank: 50 lbs<br />weight in grams: 22,680 grams of CO2<br />cost to refill - Summer 2011: $35<br /><br />CO2 grams/liter of carbonated water: 7 grams<br /><br />*Efficiency of Restaurant CO2 Carbonation<br />losses: 10%<br />available CO2 in tank (residual is required for pressure): 85%<br />net accessible CO2 of total: 77%<br />usable grams of CO2: 17,350 grams<br /><br />*Output<br />carbonated liters of water: 2,479<br />cost per liter in USD$: $0.014<br /><br />*SodaStream Output<br />SodaStream Refill: 130 liters (quoted end product)<br />Cost per refill: $30.00<br />cost per SodaStream carbonated water: $0.231<br /><br />*SodaStream Markup Economics<br />ratio of SodaStream to Restaurant prices: 16.3x<br />SodaStream inflation price over restaurant pricing: 1534%<br />math: [y/x-x] to give increase over base case restaurant pricing<br /><br />This is an incredible 1500% markup<br /><br />Pros<br />Saves plastic<br />Allows flexible mixture of flavors<br /><br />Cons<br />Cost of output is not compelling<br />Grossly inflated CO2 refill costs<br />Another store trip required for refills separate from grocery store visit<br /><br />***Disclaimer: I am an investor who has used the product multiple times. At the time of this review, I did NOT have an investment in SodaStream either short or long. In the past, I have both owned the stock and shorted it (bet against it). I may be on either side of the trade by the time you read this -- I am not very sentimental.
