review/summary: Chemical taste, ultra sweet
review/text: Unfortunately I found the Cafe Escapes excessively sweet and had a strange aftertaste,  I actually threw them out after my husband and I tried them, particularly after reviewing the ingredient list.  I recommend the Green Mountain "Hot Cocoa" K cups as they taste  much, much better in my opinion.

review/text: I was so excited to get the Keurig Brewer for my staff (They have been hinting for months). I ran out and bought an assortment of K-Cups to surprise them in the morning.  I just tried the Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa, milk chocolate.  It was awful, watered down, too sweet, and left a terrible artificial sweetener after taste.<br />I hope to have better luck with the coffee.

review/text: Palatable for kids but that's about the best I can say about them.  On par with the more mediocre generic instant hot chocolates, but at the cost per cup for these should be much better.  Making a 4oz cup and bolstering the flavor with 2% milk is required even to get a child to drink them.  My advice is to pick up an alternative brand's seasonal premium hot chocolate for the K-cup makers and skip this Green Mountain/Cafe Escapes variety- as these are disappointing at best.<br /><br />Avoid if possible, but not a total waste.  Consider my 2 stars as "generous."

review/text: The key to enjoyment with these:  Use a keurig that has a small/large cup setting. Microwave/stove-top heat a 3rd of what you want to drink of milk to a boil. Put the milk in the mug, and brew the hot chocolate directly into it. Top with whipped cream.<br /><br />IF you drink it this way, its perfect, otherwise there's a slight after taste(just like every other cocoa mix if you ask me).

review/summary: Great Milk Choclate, Hot Cocoa
review/text: I love chocolate everything and have purchased and used three brands of hot cocoa, from Amazon, in our Keurig K-cup brewer which was a 2011 Christmas gift. The best milk chocolate flavor consumed was Cafe Escapes followed by Grove Square and totally unacceptable Green Mountain Coffee, Hot cocoa, which went to our local refuse hauler. I feel that you get what you pay for as Cafe Escapes was the highest cost and Green Mountain the cheapest and worst. I noticed that both Cafe Escapes and Grove Square were labeled Milk chocolate flavor,Hot Cocoa, Green Mountain was not which may account for it's strange flavor. I wish there was a means of securing product samples rather than purchasing two boxes of some products like green Mountain.

review/summary: Flavor is ok, but watch out for the aluminum!
review/text: We have only had the Keurig coffee maker for a couple of months (yes, it was a Christmas gift) and my wife is the main user.  So, it's possible that the problem I'm having is common to other coffee/hot chocolate cups in addition to these Cafe Escapes.  At any rate, unlike many of the other reviewers, I think the hot chocolate flavor is pretty good.  My problem is that at least half the time I find a tiny piece of aluminum -- sometimes two tiny pieces -- floating on top of the chocolate in the cup.  The Keurig works, of course, by punching a small hole in the chocolate/coffee container.  I assume the tiny piece of aluminum is from the whole punched in the container.  I would guess that if the cups were properly designed, this wouldn't happen.<br /><br />I would also guess that there are times when the aluminum drops below the surface and I swallow it.  Probably not a major health risk ... but it can't be good!  At any rate, I won't be buying this brand of hot chocolate again.<br /><br />Edited on May 26:  Since I wrote this review, we have used a number of other brands of chocolate and coffee k-cups without encountering this problem.  Another user in commenting on this review notes that he or she has not had this problem with Cafe Escapes.  So perhaps it was just a defective batch.

review/summary: Horrible Chemical Taste
review/text: New to the world of Keurig, I bought these K-cups in a large package for my husband and I to share.  Unfortunately we were very disappointed.  Hot chocolate K-cups are designed to quick-dissolve (compared to the regular hot chocolate packages you buy from the store) and it tastes like chemicals.  The milk chocolate is no different than the dark chocolate when it comes to chemical taste.  After playing with different water level settings, I eventually just had to throw them out.  Now we buy normal hot chocolate packets instead.

review/text: These may be the best pretzels I've ever had. They're tasty AND healthy (bonus: They're organic). Good alone or with salsa, guacamole or a non-fat dips. Or add some apple or pear slices, a dollop of yogurt or some fresh veggies for a quick and healthy at-home or on the go snack.<br /><br />I first came across them in a desperate attempt to wean myself from baked white cheddar chips. Looking for something crunchy yet non-fattening wasn't easy. You get 15 pretzel sticks at only 130 calories and no saturated or trans fats. Works for me!<br /><br />Best of all, there's 4% dietary fiber in a serving. (About 8 servings to an 8-ounce bags, so we're talking about a week's worth of healthy snacks.)<br /><br />The honey wheat flavor is great and best of all, it's a satisfying snack, too.<br /><br />If you buy in bulk, be sure to hide away those other bags and count out portions. Otherwise, it's way too easy to overeat these pretzels.

review/summary: Good pretzel, if slightly sweet.
review/text: The problem with most pretzels is that they are white-flour bombs.  Lots of carbohydrate and not much else (other than a ton of salt).  Consequently, I have been looking for a good whole-grain pretzel.  These are pretty good.  The multiple grains add a variety and depth of flavor not found in plain pretzels, and you sure don't miss the extra salt.  Although they have a crunch, they are not so hard that my wife won't eat them.  They have only three flaws.  First, they are slightly sweet.  Although it is a subtle sweetness (which I suppose some folks like), I could do without it.  Second, white flour remains the number one ingredient, notwithstanding the multiplicity of whole grains.  Third, although they are low fat, they are not fat-free.  I am not sure why the bakers find it necessary to add oil to a pretzel.  Despite these shortcomings, these are a good--and healthier--alternative to standard prtezels, and much, much healthier than most other salty snacks.

review/text: BEWARE of the warehouse deals - many of the products are near end of shelf life and often there is no way to ask about that, so you end up with a case of food items that you might have hoped would last a few months that require being consumed in a month or less.<br /><br />The case I ordered was near its shelf life expiration and the product is moderately tasty.

review/summary: Good tasting Organic Pretzel sticks by SNYDER"S
review/text: This was a great tasting organic snack food, buying it through Amazon in bulk, it costs less, stays fresh and delivered to my door. It is priced a lot better than in the stores, if you can even find it in a store! It is a good product that myself and husband enjoy. If you like pretzels want organic and are looking for a slightly salty/sweet taste, then this is one you will enjoy too!<br /> This is an edit of my review as my last shippment of this product was not very good... the pretzels in this latest shipment have an odd taste to them...sad as they were so good tasting in prior shipments...I also see that you can not get this organic Pretzel anymore as it show as unavailable, this maybe is due to the problem I am having, perhaps someone else found this odd taste that wasn't there before so<br />I'd change my rating on this product now after the problem w/ this shippment I hope they fix the problem.

review/text: I'm making some healthier lifestyle choices.  I ordered these pretzels because they were multigrain and I want to add more fiber to my diet.

review/text: Snyder did it all right. (you used to be able to get these in the big pretzel size in my grocery store, but they are no longer available where I live) The pumpernickel is delish, the onion is very faint, but distinguishible, and the salt is just enough to get you all excited, but not too much to overpower the pumpernickel. The sticks are a fun shape to munch, and if you have company that likes to dip things these are a good size for that (no double dipping). Sticks are about 3 inches long.

review/text: it's not your typical pretzel. I don't eat much pumpernickel, so it took me half a bag to get used to. after that, I liked it. I don't like that it comes in a pack of 12; these are regular sized packs. I was hoping for snack size packs. Anyway, the best thing about this is that it is good fer ya and has a different flavor; it's always good to play with the palette a little. world peace!

review/text: I've used this product for years.  If only the salt content were lower...it would be a perfect side dish.  I love that it has sooooo much flavor and is so simple to prepare.  Pour contents into a large bowl, add 2 to 2 1/4 cups of purified water and a tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.  Cook on high for 10 minutes in the microwave and you've got a delicious meal companion.  The flavor is always outstanding.  Quality control with this product is fabulous!  I've tried other pre-packaged pasta mixes but I always come back to this one.  It's just DELICIOUS!!  Now if only they would use sea salt!!  Of course, it's pasta so nutrition is not like a fresh salad or a bowl of broccoli but it really does taste great!

review/text: Warning, they DO NOT taste like hot dogs. They are merely shaped like hot dogs. I grew up with these and hear they are a bit of an acquired taste. (One of my friends didn't like them at first but I stubbornly kept feeding them to her. Finally she admitted, "They grow on you...like mold." And now she wants Big Franks whenever we see each other.) Wonderful cut up, fried, and added to omelets, diced potatoes, or macaroni. Shred them, mix with mayo, and have a tuna sandwich substitute. Or just eat them like hot dogs.<br /><br />I just about had a happygasm when I found Loma Linda products on Amazon. I live overseas with the military and, as you can guess, it's difficult to find my childhood foods here.

review/text: I have eaten Big Franks for years. They are lower in fat and more digestable than beef weiners.  The flavor is pleasant, the texture is very meat-like.  They are precooked so they can be warmed in the mocrowave for about 2 minutes for four franks.  They are very versatile and can be carried without refrigerated if they have not been opened.  Soy is the major ingredient and it is the only plant protien which is a complete protein by itself.  Patricia Neely-Mississippi

review/text: I grew up on Loma Linda products and was excited to see them available on Amazon.  The bad news is that these low fat big franks are way different than the normal ones.  I was excited to have my newly vegetarian girlfriend try them out, but then I was embarrassed because they weren't nearly as good.  They actually made us both a little sick.  They're just too dense and strange.<br /><br />Stick with the linketts or find normal big franks somewhere else.  I don't think they are on Amazon.

review/summary: Good alternative to Big Franks
review/text: I was very excited to find Worthington/Loma Linda now being sold on Amazon.  We live about 40 miles outside Loma Linda (or La Sierra) and stores around here either don't carry the brand or they are just plain too expensive.  We've always like buying the cases to save a bit of money, and because we don't get up there that often so we like to stock up.<br /><br />The prices here on Amazon using their Subscribe & Save feature, can be quite competitive with these stores, however, Big Franks are a VERY expensive even with S&S (I can get them for fifty cents less at my local Stater Bros a can at a time and La Sierra had them for four thirty nine a can), so I decided to try the Low Fat Big Franks which are much more reasonably priced.<br /><br />That being said, this review is coming from someone who's not a big fan of Big Franks (I like the Diced Chik and Vegetable Steaks), however, as far as Big Franks go these are just as good as the regular (full fat) ones.  My son and wife really like Big Franks and they really couldn't tell the difference.<br /><br />EDIT:  Amazon's price on all Worthington foods has skyrocketed!  Nearly SIX dollar a can is ridiculous.  Check your local supermarket and ask if they have a case discount or check with your local SDA church and ask when they're having their next campmeeting.  Campmeeting time is a perfect time to stock up because they normally have huge sales on veggie food.  For example, 2010 Phoenix area campmeeting sale had regular BigFranks for FORTY dollars a case.

I cooked them on the stove with green peppers and onions (like Polish sausages) in some of the broth from the can and they turned out great! The appearance would be better if you brown or grill them, but the taste and texture is great. Also, I was very pleased with the nutritional facts - not too much sodium or fat, a good-sized serving and some fiber. I like that they are shelf-stable and will keep for a long time. It is too bad that these are not more widely available.

review/text: I first ran across this while working on a TV show - it was on the craft service (snack) table.  I had tried other flavors before, but this version was new to me--LOVED IT!<br /><br />Easily on-par with what you might find at a local bistro, at a fraction of the price. This flavor is top-notch,and truly takes just 1.5 minutes to make.<br /><br />The sip-cup is quite handy for a quick pick-me-up or lunch, or you can put the heated contents into a mug or bowl, and perhaps add in a grilled cheese sand made on any number of contact grills ( George Foreman, Wolfgang Puck's Pannini grill...) to truly make this a hearty meal, in a matter of minutes. (like, maybe 5-- thats MY kind of cooking!)<br /><br />For reasons unknown, this particular flavor can sometimes be hard to find, both in regular stores or at Amazon. Seems to sell out frequently.  I like the auto-ship from Amazon, rather than buying single cans at the supermarket.<br /><br />It is also kind of a nice product to send along to college kids and seniors, as well - two groups NOT well known to always eat well.  They would appreciate something like this, trust me.  And, yup, it is available on motion picture and television shoot's, with some VERY picky eater's!<br /><br />This is truly a five star item, and one that I will never be without.  Yum!

review/text: I was a bit skeptical about this soup being any good but when I prepared it I found it quite enjoyable and easy.  Perfect for a quick lunch on the go, or with a nice toasty grilled cheese sandwich. It's got a lovely Parmesan flavor to it and the soup itself is creamy and not too acidic.  I plan to order more!!

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I've never been a big fan of tomato soup but this flavor is delicious. I really like the creamy texture. Adding cheese crackers makes it even more tasty. The microwave container and serving size makes for a convenient meal when you want something quick, delicious, and not too heavy.<br /><br />Lately, I haven't been able to find it in my neighborhood supermarket. So I'm glad that I can purchase it here.

review/summary: Sone Ugly Added Spice That Looks Like Mouse Droppings
review/text: I ended up throwing this one away mid-way because I kept picking brown mouse like droppings out of my mouth. I inspected it to see what it could be, likely just a spice they added, but the chunks were big, and seeing that they looked just like mouse poop, I could not continue on and finish it.<br /><br />Its a shame because the soup itself tastes great... however I cannot get past the spice things they added. They looked far too much like rodent droppings.

review/summary: Good mid morning pick me up
review/text: This is my favorite mid morning snack. I set the whole container inside a coffee cup because I have had them flip over in the microwave. I nuke mine for 90 seconds,stir and go. I especially love the flavor of this brand. I also have had a hard time finding this product in the stores so I started ordering it from Amazon and have regularly scheduled shipments. Now I don't have to run to all the stores around town looking for it.

review/summary: Cheap thrills and convenience
review/text: I've been buying these soups as a matter of cheap thrills and convenience. They are probably best used as a no-fuss and light lunch st work and school. Not all of the flavors are created equal, however. I rank the ones I've tried as follows:<br /><br />1. Tomato Parmesan<br />2. Cream of broccoli<br />3. New England clam chowder.<br /><br />The first two are very tasty. The third is a bit bland but still pretty decent.<br /><br />I can think of three advantages of going with this product:<br /><br />1. Cost. Bloom charges me $1.89 a can for this soup. Amazon's subscription plans often make the soup significantly less expensive.<br /><br />2. Ease of preparation. Just shake, microwave for 90 seconds, and you're ready to go. No other cooking utensils or preparation is required. The metal rims on the containers do not cause sparking. Pretty neat.<br /><br />3. Ease of consumption. Just sip from the container, which seems to be a foam material or plastic that doesn't conduct much heat and is easy to hold. It fits easily into car cup holders. No spoons or bowls are required.<br /><br />Anyone on a low-salt diet should think twice. The soups have 30+ percent of the RDA. The fat content is a bit elevated. These things are to maintain the flavor. Calories don't go above 220 or so.<br /><br />All in all, these soups have turned out to be an unexpected winner. I expect to be buying more.

review/text: This is a must-have to keep in your office desks for those quick-grab lunches, snacks, or even breakfast on a cold morning.  This particular flavor, the Creamy Tomato Parmesan Bisque, is high in sugar - be aware of that.  Most of the flavors are lower in carbs and calories.  This one is worth it, as long as you are aware!

review/text: Hatch brand sauces and chilies are the best in my opinion. Whenever I can find them, I will buy the Hatch brand over any other. The medium heat in the Tomatoes Diced with Green Chilies is about right for me, has a hot kick to it but not so hot you cannot enjoy the flavor.

review/summary: The Best!
review/text: I have to say that as far as Louisiana hot sauce goes, this is THE ONE. Not too hot and not too mild. The flavor of it is so clean and nice.<br />As for price, it is cheaper at Shop Rite, but you have to get it in a huge bottle. If you want the small one that fits in the fridge, Amazon is the cheapest way to go. I keep both on hand and go through it faster than any other condiment in the house.

review/summary: The label says "Extra hot" - and it's right!
review/text: One wide-nostriled whiff of this stuff and you'll know how it felt to be gassed in the trenches during World War I, so when it arrives, use the same technique as chemists do which is to waft it towards your nose. (If you want to play a very horrible practical joke on someone, ask them to smell it without telling them what it is).<br /><br />Once it's inside your mouth, the vapors immediately travel up your nostrils and down your lungs and sting like hell. As you gasp for breath, it only serves to draw more vapors in, compounding the problem. My wife and kids, who refused to go near it, were in fits of laughter the first day I tried it. I'd periodically convulse at the dinner table as the fumes burned the lining of my respiratory system, unable to speak.<br /><br />If you enjoy the burning sensation if spicy foods you will love this. Obviously horseradish/wasabi are a different kind of heat to a chili pepper, but it adds a bit of variety.<br /><br />My favorite meal with this is to mix the sauce with sour cream, then serve over grilled steak, cherry tomatoes and arugula in warmed up French bread.  Delicious!  Don't forget the gas mask for your dining companions, and the video camera.

We came running fearing, something bad had happened, only to be greeted by her teary eyed, coughing and leaking from nose and mouth. Nuff said.

review/summary: Favorite Tea
review/text: Honestly the best herbal tea I've had.  I love tea, and have spent years trying new teas from all over the world.  I used to live near a store that carried this tea, but when I moved away I thought I could find a replacement.  After four years searching, I have finally given up and bought the six-pack on amazon.  It's just as wonderful as I remember.  Very aromatic, and tastes just as delicious and strong as it smells.  Great mint flavor with just enough sweetness to make it the perfect anytime herbal tea - it's just as great with breakfast as it is as a sweet treat before bed.<br /><br />Each individual box is separately wrapped, which helps keep the tea fresh as you work your way through the boxes.  Even once the box is unwrapped, the tea bags stay flavorful for a long time (I was so reluctant to run out, I spaced my last box out, ending up using the final tea bag 3 years after purchase, and it was still delicious).

review/summary: Satisfying Delectable Brew
review/text: .<br /><br />As one who loves coffee, I have been testing various coffees for many months.  Although I enjoyed light and medium roast coffees, I learned that dark roasts were much better for my tastes.  I learned that dark brews are more gentle on the digestive system as the increased roasting removes some oils that do not interact well with the stomach.  Additionally, dark roasts tend to have a richer, more full bodied flavor.<br /><br />So, I have tested many dark roasts.  My favorites have consistently been French roasts and Italian roast coffees.  I have been using Italian roast for some time.  Recently I noticed that Boyers Coffee decided to feature "Boyer's Select",  a brew that is the favorite of their employees.<br /><br />Boyer's Select features coffee beans that are grown at high altitudes and includes only quality Arabica beans.  The company advertises this coffee as a blend of Costa Rican, Samatra Mendeheling, and Colombian Suprimo beans, and claims it has a full bodied flavor.  This coffee tantalizes my taste buds and calms my soul.  This is my new favorite.  Boyer's Select is quality coffee.  It Is rich and flavorful.<br /><br />I am a person who enjoys my time in the mountains regardless of the season.  Having a cup of this coffee is like awakening to a refreshing warm breeze while camping on a remote snow filled mountain meadow.  I highly recommend this coffee.
