review/summary: Things you need to know
review/text: Yes, they are good. However, they are absolutely inundated with the flavoring stuff, which is initially satisfying then becomes "too much". And certainly isn't good for the waistline or general nutritional issues.<br /><br />AND the package can't be opened without a sharp implement. I couldn't pull it apart at the top as I am used to doing. I don't normally carry a knife or scissors and don't have rodent teeth. Well, I was hungry and was able to rip the bag using my car key. Even then, the bag was *wow* thick and tough.<br /><br />On the package it says these are "Krinkle Cut" chips. Turns out that means the corrugated kind, not what I wanted. I don't eat ripple/ridged style chips any more because they take the skin off the roof of my mouth. So this information is important.<br /><br />These are good but so are other brands with which I don't have these problems.

review/summary: I made a mistake.....
review/text: This may sound rediculous, but I actually ordered the wrong brand of potato chips when I ordered these Kettle-brand jalapeno chips.  At the time I placed my order, I couldn't remember the name of the jalapeno chips that I had recently discovered and liked, and the Kettle-brand chips were packaged in a similarly-colored bag.  But, it all worked out for the best because I do really like the Kettle-brand of jalapeno chips, and will happily munch away on them during upcoming TV football games.  When I run out (probably sometime next year!), I will likey purchase Miss Vicky brand of jalapeno chips, and I plan to try the other flavors of Kettle-brand chips.  Imho, Kettle-brand chips are excellent and I recommend them to all potato chip 'affection-ados'.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  � homiedog �

review/summary: Do they have to "bite back"?
review/text: I want to like Kettle because they contain no corn oil or soybean oil (which are both GMO, and also my kids are allergic to corn and soy), but darnit, these things bite back! On the plus side, the sharpness of them may keep you from mindlessly enjoying too many. On the minus side, a mouthful of cuts and scratches is not worth it. Do they have to be SO hard and crunchy? What's wrong with simply light and crispy? I vastly prefer Lay's texture, but suffer with Kettle due to the absense of GMOs and corn/soy. I wish they'd come out with something less harsh on the mouth, though.

review/summary: These chips are awesome if not best but....
review/text: I think these chips are awesome if not the best along with Poor Brothers Salt and Vinager chips. But if you buy these Spicy Thai chips in a smaller bag it might have too much of the flavor (at the bottom of the bag) in it then the larger bag at least that was my experience last time I bought these off amazon but that was like in 2010. So I would suggest trying Spicy Thai in a bag bigger then 5 ounces.

It was good, but too sweet for my taste. I scoup this into a bowl, add a little vanilla, a little milk and a drizzle of honey, then stir it all together. It makes a spread with just the right sweetness for my taste.  I finally have something to replace the nut butters that I used to enjoy.

review/summary: Excellent elbows!
review/text: This is by far the best GF macaroni I've found.  A friend bought me a bag at a local healthfood store ($4.99!) and I didn't think I'd like it..but wow, it is just like the "real" thing!  Comparable to Muellers elbows.  I've used it for both hot dishes (excellent for mac & cheese) and cold salads, and it does not loose its shape or texture during cooking.  I truly dislike rice-based pasta because of the white goo that is in the water after cooking.  And I hate having to rinse the pasta before adding sauce - you will not have either of these issues with this pasta.<br /><br />I know it's expensive, but honestly - it is worth the price.  And, anything less than $4.99 a bag seems like a good deal to me!  Our local stores really gouge for GF items.

He and I were both socked.  It not only has the taste of gluten pasta but the texture as well.  I have had both the spaghetti and elbow mac and would recommend both.  I have not bought it here so can not a test to the shipping just the product<br /><br />Update:<br />Since I wrote this review I have bought it through Amazon and found it to be a much better deal. I have also made a number of meals with it and even used it in a dish to pass. No one could tell the difference, they all thought it was traditional pasta not gluten free. I just with Bionaturae would come out with a gluten free lasagna noodles so I could make that from scratch too.

review/text: Since realizing that my son is gluten sensitive/celiac, I have tried a lot of different GF pastas, so was excited to try this based on the great reviews. While I would agree that it is the best rice/potato based GF pastas I have had, I would not say it is the best GF pasta out there. It is still quite chewy and there is a lot of starchiness in the water when it's done cooking...like glue. Taste and texture improve when it's reheated and liquid is added for absorption. If you are looking for a GF pasta that's better than regular pasta, try the Quinoa/Corn pasta by Ancient Harvest. That is the best GF pasta in my family's opinion.

review/text: I am personally trying to eat gluten free. I purchased this product in hopes that I could still eat things like Macaroni and cheese, as long as I could find a suitable alternative for my wheat pasta. This product does exactly that. I have cooked about 6 bags of this stuff so far, and nobody can tell the difference between it and regular pasta. I have noticed that it takes about 15 minutes to cook, which is longer than normal pasta, but other than that, its perfect. If you are looking for a healthy alternative to pasta.....I would recommend that you give this product a try.

review/summary: Very good. Worth paying a little more for.
review/text: Gluten-free foods are pretty expensive, especially for a single mom. But pasta the teen will love, and that doesn't have what seems like a 60-second window on timing for being edible, is a big deal. I have overcooked and undercooked this, and while it was apparent, it was no worse than it would be with doing the same with ordinary pasta. It makes great real mac&cheese and chicken pesto pasta and the bulk buy means I never have an excuse to eat gluten and take gluten-ease and "hope to live to do better another day" -- because I have something better at hand. I think the elbows seem ever so slightly thicker than the cheap gluten-ish stuff in the store but not enough to consciously notice unless you're looking for some difference. I wish this was cheaper but I'm willing to pay it.

review/summary: No good with tomato sauce or mac & cheese sauce
review/text: I tried this many years ago (same ingredients as they have now) and I really did want to like it because I know how bad regular wheat pasta if for me and I've been loving elbow macaroni since I was a kid and  hoped I could make my own mac and cheese out of this. But white rice also gives me tummy trouble and this is made mostly of white rice. But that's not the only reason I gave it just 2 stars. As I've said in my other bionaturae pasta reviews, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. All of their pastas are made from the same "formula" (that's what they call it). And no matter how many times I've tried it, different types of pastas, different cooking times, they all taste chewy and sticky. The taste is not horrible but texture just ruins the entire eating experience.<br /><br />My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally. But if you do choose to buy this and can't get it locally, Amazon Prime is the way to go.

Like I said, sticky, chewy, tacky.<br /><br />> It felt like wet cement in my stomach. It made me constipated because it is not made from whole grains. And smothering it with my special melted cheese sauce didn't help any. It just made it heavier in my tummy.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But as I've mentioned in other reviews, poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.

review/summary: Disappointing
review/text: I was eager to try these after I heard about them, but ended up being rather disappointed.  I love chocolate and marshmallows and thought this mix looked delicious, so I picked it over the other varieties available.  Unfortunately, the mini marshmallows are nothing like marshmallows -- I was expecting them to be like those found packaged with hot chocolate or in cereals, but they're solid little sugar pellets that are way too hard to chew comfortably.  The graham cracker pieces are also overly crunchy and unpleasant.  The coconut flakes, which I would generally imagine are hard to mess up, seem to be more sugar than coconut...they pretty much melt in your mouth, but not in the good way.  The milk chocolate candies are good (mine did not contain peanut butter as another reviewer mentioned), as are the cocoa roast almonds and honey roasted peanuts.<br /><br />I had been wanting to try the Chocolate Cherry mix, but after this experience, I'm not so sure.  Emerald had a good idea that was, unfortunately, shoddily executed and left me with the opinion that they should stick with what they know...nuts.

review/text: These are alright, but I really don't like candy peanut butter (even though I do like the stuff you get in a brand-name jar).  I've also never heard of making smores with peanut butter, but for some reason these have a bunch of little M&M-sized peanut butter candy things inside.  Also, the marshmallow-like extrusions are pretty hard to crunch up.  Overall, I liked this reasonably well (the graham chunks are good, as are the cocoa almonds and honey-roasted peanuts - and even the hard marshmallows), but the peanut butter really turns me off.  If you, however, enjoy the way the peanut butter-like filling in a generic Reeces peanut butter cup tastes, and you think you would like that taste on smores, you may also like this. :)

review/summary: Nice mix of crunch and soft, salty and sweet
review/text: Overall this product tastes amazing.  Its crunch is a bit hard.  The graham cracker cubes are tasty but take a bit to get through.  Even the marshmallows are dry and crunch.  Most of the chewy soft comes from large coconut flakes and the soft centers of candy covered chocolate pieces (think M&M's).  The nuts are typical, good crunch Emerald quality.  I am a big fan of their Cocoa Roasted Almonds so when I saw this mix on sale at my grocery store I had to give it a try.  It would be very difficult to not eat the entire bag in one sitting.  I measured mine into one ounce servings and then put them where I could not see them so that I have to think of it to find it.  Yes, it is that tasty.  If I see it I will want it and will therefore eat it.  I typically have respectable self control around food, but sweetened nuts seem to be a weakness of mine.

review/summary: Delicious mountain jasmine green tea
review/text: Organic Spring Jasmine is a nice light to medium tea with a calming scent of jasmine coming from the cup. The jasmine part isn't overwhelming like other blends can be, but it's more like a delicate floral aroma behind the main taste of the China green tea in the bag. The green tea itself tastes fairly delicate yet still green, without being very vegetal or fishy, like some greens can be. The ingredients are of high quality, and it has a medium to heavy body, or "mouth" feel, for a tea. Combined, the flower & tea work in perfect tandem; when sipping the cup you first get the floral of jasmine, then you get the beautiful flavor of green tea. So yummy! I would call it a perfect pairing.<br /><br />When I serve this to anybody, they immediately say "Oooh I LIKE this!" (or some iteration of that), and then ask from where do I get the tea. Then, they either start the same scouring high and low for the tea that I once did, or they plain out ask me to buy some for them because they can't stop thinking about it once they've had it.<br /><br />Note: Mighty Leaf teas are the best bagged teas; they have quality handcrafted silk-like tea pouches that let the leaves (yes, LEAVES) inside fully steep & expand without adding any additional "bag" flavor, as some paper bags do. This creates an exceptional cup of tea for the individual. They just scream "quality". Once you see one of the bags, you will probably want to get some for yourself, too. I'd say Mighty Leaf teas would make great gifts for tea lovers.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon, Organic Spring Jasmine is now a staple in my home - through the subscribe & save, you can get a 3-pack for around $15 at the time of this writing, which is quite a deal considering the quality of tea you get for a comparable price to supermarket brands. I hope they continue to supply it forever since I now drink it every day.

review/summary: More jasmine smell than flavor
review/text: This is a nice green tea, but while it has a nice hint of jasmine in the bag it really gets lost in brewing so that this really just tastes more like a good green tea.  If that's what you're after I'd recommend this tea, but if you're after a more jasmine fragrance and flavor experience I find this one a little weak.  The Adagio Jasmine I used to order (now I guess listed as an Oolong by them) was much more to my liking, but it also was a bit overpowering to some so like everything it comes down to personal taste.

review/text: Actually I was looking for 'jasmine mist', which I was hooked after staying in a lovely hotel.  Instead, I decided to try the organic spring jasmine:it still had that lovely fragrant and taste of the jasmine mist, but a tad less strong.  it was just peeerrrfect.  One bag held its flavor for a large teapot, if you want it stronger then just use it with a good size mug.  I normally like my tea strong, so this tea held its own in terms of flavor and strength.  Sometimes, I just allow the tea to go cold and there is no lost in fragrant and flavor.  So glad that amazon is supporting this brand.

I immediately fell in love.  Definitely a step above brands like Twinings (my wife doesn't think so, but the difference is marked).  You can taste the difference in the whole leaf in the bag.  The floral flavor is pronounced yet doesn't overpower the tea.  Lovely cup.

review/text: I am a huge tea fan. I drink hot tea more than I drink cold water throughout the day. So, it is easy to say that I am very picky when it comes to my tea. I have tried tons of different flavors and tons of different brands. My friend recommended Mighty Leaf and I decided to give it a try. The second that the three-minute brew time was up, I immediately smelled one of the greatest scents I have experienced. The jasmine is not too strong and not too weak. While drinking the first cup that I made for myself, it actually made me feel very relaxed. There is a perfect ratio of herbs to 1 tea-bag. I am very glad that my friend gave me the recommendation and hope to buy a case of other flavors to try.

I do have to remove some of the larger bones, but all good anchovies are like that. I did notice that the oil they're packed in gets a little thick when kept in the refrigerator, but we just blotted it off before adding them to our salad. Try them on buttered saltines - delicious!

I bought a sample pack, one that was called "Mahale Highlands" (not this brand however) was in the sample pack and I really liked it.  I found this particular brand (Wolfgang Puck) and it was cheaper and I got a larger quantity.  It is a very good coffee; not bitter and I feel that the product is of high quality.  The taste is evenly balanced and has a fresh taste the Keurig pods were lacking.  I have made this coffee for other people and they agreed:  it was a very good cup of coffee.

review/summary: Superb rub for pork and lamb...
review/text: As a spice mix fan, I have to give a strong thumbs-up for Chef Tom's Pork Rub.  The dominant notes in this mix are cumin, coriander, and chile.  This isn't a hot mix per se - if you want to kick things up a notch, I'd recommend adding a dash of cayenne - but it is excellent.  Only the two standout mixes that Chef Tom sells: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTHI">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Salmon Rub</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5TTL4">Chef Tom Douglas Rub With Love Chicken Rub</a> are better.<br /><br />This is best on baby back ribs, lamb chops, and pork roast.  I only remove a star because the mix isn't that versatile: it's not particularly suited for spicing up soup, chicken, or fish.

review/text: I applied this rub onto a pork shoulder and let it sit overnight in the fridge. I smoked it for 10 hours the next day and the meat turned out fabulously. The rub gave a definite spice to the shoulder but I found it heavy on the paprika and somewhat sour with an after-taste. The ingredients were very straightforward and pretty much what you find in almost all of the rub recipes online but I think I'd prefer a little sweetness to complement the meat.  Next time I'll try mixing my own spices but it'd be handier to have everything pre-mixed.

review/summary: Not exceptional
review/text: After reading the many glowing reviews of MightyLeaf Tea, I thought that I would splurge for a real treat.  Unfortunately, my first cup was not at all tasty.  I do not normally use a sweetener in my tea.  However, I tried a second cup with a sweetener and it was fine but not exceptional for the price. Since the MightyLeaf tea bags have leaves of many plants, it is not clear how consistency is maintained.  Maybe, I just got a bad tea bag.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: I wanted to have a more healthy type of mushroom on hand for cooking other than the canned variety so tried these.  I let them "reconstitute" for quite a while (a couple of hours...though package says half an hour...) based on reviews of other dried mushrooms.  Though they're mushroom caps, there still was a small stem portion on a few and even after all that soaking, they were still rather tough so I cut them off before cooking.  They cooked well (used them in beef stroganoff and also sauteed them with butter on their own) and they tasted good. Only issue was the odor they gave off when soaking - very strong/not pleasant - but this didn't affect taste at all. Will definitely use again/keep on hand for when I can't get fresh mushrooms.

review/text: Look elsewhere for a better DEAL on Amazon by buying bulk than this ripoff OVERPRICED item.<br />Besides, these contain stems/partial stems, which not only cheapens the price but wounds up uneven done-ness. If you want best quality, your best bet would be to look for stem-free (caps only) variety even though they tend to cost more. From one gourmet chef to another, hope it helps.

Granted, as with any other GF pasta, it takes about twice as long to cook as non-GF pasta, but at least this Tinkyada pasta doesn't fall apart as soon as it's cooked. Tinkyada pasta holds up for reheating.

Or, toss some of the Tinkyada penne with some Purdue Italian Grilled Chicken Strips, a little seasoned olive oil, some presliced onion+peppers, some Parmesan cheese... Throw some Udi's GF dinner rolls on the side, a bottle of wine... just sayin'  :-)<br /><br />Tinkyada pastas of all varieties are a staple in our pantry:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63SS">Tinkyada Brown Rice Lasagne with Rice Bran, 10-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK7PQW">Tinkyada Brown Rice Elbows with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63IS">Tinkyada Brown Rice Spaghetti with Rice Bran, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK8VHE">Tinkyada Brown Rice Spirals with Rice Bran,  Gluten Free, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKAYO2">Tinkyada Brown Rice Fusilli, 16-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FK63QA">Tinkyada Brown Rice Fettuccini Style with Rice Bran, 14-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)</a><br /><br />Tinkyada does it ALL gluten free, and they do it ALL VERY WELL!!  :-)

review/summary: Pass It Up...Tasteless
review/text: I recently picked up a couple of packs of this mix at a local dollar store.  Like most people I am familiar with Marie Callender's products and I figured for a dollar, how bad could it be.  Well now that I have sampled it I am afraid that I have to agree with the other reviewer here that says its taste is downright weird, and honestly speaking, not like cornbread at all.  I followed the directions by adding an egg, milk, and oil, (1/4 cup of each) as directed, and even though it said it could be cooked in the microwave in a couple of minutes, I opted for the oven figuring it would come out better.  It cooked up easy and fast enough but that is where the pleasure of this mix ended its virtues.  Unlike most cornbread I have baked it rises really high in the cup and is very light and fluffy.  And it's is not crumbly like most good corn bread is either.  As for it's taste, there is next to none in my opinion.  I was taking big bites of the muffins with a generous amount of butter on them and still couldn't get a hint of corn bread flavor. And trust me when I say I have tried many different corn bread mixes in the past.  Everything from Jiffy to Larry The Cable guys brand. What taste I did sense was truly downright strange.  Not really awful, but as tasteless a cornbread I have ever had. It reminded me more of a cheap cake mix in texture and taste than a cornbread. I'm not even going to bake the other pouch I have. In conclusion, I would not recommend this mix to anyone, at any price I'm afraid... : (

I buy 2-pound (32-ounce) containers of dates, very much like illustrated here and put out by the same company. I found them at my local warehouse club. The ones I buy are Fancy Medjool Dates with pits. The ones listed here are unspecified pitted dates. I'm sure either would work, perhaps equally well. In any case, these dates make a wonderful sweet treat for people who are trying to stay away from manufactured sweets. Plus they offer a good source of dietary fiber.

I use it daily for my coffee (Hagen organic freeze dried) and no longer add stevia. It reminds me of oat milk and does not have a nutty flavor, more of a slight caramel flavor to me. I'm perplexed another reviewer did not like it in their coffee although I guess if one is used to diary and has not experimented w/ other "milks" it might be too different. I hope they will make an organic version in the future.

review/text: I LIKE THE PRODUCT VERY MUCH BUT BE AWARE THAT THE "BEST BY" DATE IS FEBRUARY 5, 2012. I MAY NOT HAVE ORDERED IT HAD I KNOWN THE DATE, BUT THE PRICE THAT I PAID WAS VERY LOW COMPARED TO THE CURRENT LIST PRICE. THE CURRENT LIST PRICE COULD REFLECT FRESHER PRODUCT....

review/summary: Gross in coffee -- maybe for other cream uses but NOT for coffee!
review/text: Bought this because it's advertized as good as a coffee creamer too.  I found the taste pretty bad for use in coffee.  Avoid! Get the stuff that actually says coffee creamer on the box itself. I'm giving one star because of poor advertising. Maybe this works okay as a substitute for other cream uses. Not sure yet.

review/text: Lab, Golden, and even my Yorkie love these. 4 of 5 stars--- only because they do not smell very good to me. The package must remain tightly sealed, otherwise the cupboard smells terrible.

review/text: My senior dog just loves these. I try to buy 2 packages at a time, so we don't run out. The only down side is when she brings it to bed, I wake up with little shards in the sheets.  Oh well.  They seem to keep her teeth tarter free. I trust this product, there is nothing but beef ligament, no additives, no perservatives, nothing but lig.  I highy recommend this product.
