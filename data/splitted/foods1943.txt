review/summary: My cats love this food
review/text: We have two cats, one of which is 16 years old and had lost quite a bit of weight.  She looked like she was ready to die any minute.  I purchased this food for her in a local store and she loved it.  She has trouble chewing and this food is easy for her to chew, plus it has juice that she licks up every drop of.  This food has made her start eating again and she has put back on some of her weight and is looking really healthy.  Although we have dry food out all the time, the cats run to the kitchen every time we are in there hoping they will get a serving of Whiskas.  I now buy it on Amazon's subscribe and save program - we never run out and it saves me money.

review/summary: Kittties Liked at first, Then Turned Up Nose
review/text: When I initially ordered this Whiskas Perfectly Chicken for my cats, they liked it OK. They did not wolf it down, but they would eat it without complaint.<br /><br />THE FELINE EEDING SCENARIO AT MY HOME:<br /><br />My Kitties always have kibble out and eat that freely. In the moring the two of them share one can of wet food and in the evening, each cat gets his own can or pouch.<br /><br />I rotate their wet food meals so that they do not have a constant diet of any one flavor of Product. I have had cats all my life and if there is one thing I deal poorly with, it is "THE LOOK FROM THE CAT which says "Are you out of your mind? Have you lost your senses? Were you born yesterday? Do YOU NOT RECALL that I Do Not Care for That?" It can, of course, be that this attitude has developed onvernight and I am to be a cat whisperer/mind reader and know this ahead of time. But I hate that whole scenario. In my opinion, I have two overly spoiled cats who live in the lap of luxury with cat trees, cat condos, cat toys, and dry and wet cat food! Water too! Their buddy, whom I feed also, is a feral kitty and he dang well eats what there is. There is no THE LOOK from him. So I try, at all costs, to avoid THE LOOK!<br />To that end, the cats are offered a variety of wet foods. Kibble is a constant, but I try to make the wet food a treat and a time of relaxation and enjoyment. So, the Purfectly Chicken was offered about two times a week. Other varieties and other flavors were offerred at other times.<br />I put the Purfectly Chicken on "Subscibe and Save" and had it delivered every three months, so I know they were not overwhelmed with this food. But after 6 months, the noses went up and I got THE LOOK. So, I took the Chicken off "Subscribe and Save" for a year or more. Then, I was looking for something "different" to order and saw the Chicken on my old list and decided to try it again. No dice. One pouch of the plain chicken and I got THE LOOK. A couple of weeks later, I sneaked in the Chicken and Beef:  THE LOOK. Well, the feral cat really, really likes the Chicken and Duck, but I can't be buying special stuff just to keep him happy. He will have to stick with the large cans of Friskies (except of course when I feel sorry for him and sneak in the Purfectly Chicken after a run to the local grocery store).<br />So, I gave The Purfectly Chicken a fair shot with my kitties. It just isn't something they like. No accounting for taste! But, since they seem to live in their own happy, finicky world, they have told me to give Purfectly Chicken only three stars. They say they would eat it if they were truly Starving, but, hopefully, we won't have that happen and will just continue to accommodate their wishes with other wet foods.<br /><br />On the positive side, Mr. Feral Kitty has been living in my back yard for four years. (It is his choice to remain outdoors and living the wild life. But, he has progressed to the point that he appears at the back door at 5:00 PM and patiently waits until 5:30. Past that time, he begins to cry and let me know that he IS HUNGRY!) He eats once a day. His vote for Purfectly Chicken is 5 Stars. (He likes it because of the great amount of gravy and the large chunks of real meat.)<br /><br />So I have split the difference and given the product 4 Stars. Two cats give me THE LOOK. One cat really enjoys this product. If your cat is a true Chicken Lover, I believe he or she will like it quite well.<br /><br />Just FYI: My two spoiled kitties have decided that they prefer ProPlan which has Some Gravy and Small Chunks of food. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003R0LLYY">Pro Plan Canned Cat Food, Adult Salmon and Rice Entr&eacute;e In Sauce (Pack of 24 3 Ounce Cans)</a> I am well trained enough to realize that they do not care for Pate!<br /><br />I happens to be December 2011 as I am writing this, so I wish each of you a Blessed Holiday Season and and a Happy New Year! (Even if the economy tanks and things go to pieces, we can all rest assured that Amazon will continue to thrive and let us pass our thoughts on to complete strangers for many years to come)! Thank you for your attention to my review.

review/summary: My cat loves it
review/text: My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better.

review/text: My cats are on a diet of super high quality dry food, but once a day I split up a pouch of Whiskas Purrfectly Fish or Chicken between them.<br /><br />They love it.  I haven't been able to find much nutritional value of this particular wet food, but there are real bits of fish and chicken in the pouch.  Sometimes, the chicken pouches almost make me want to taste them.  The rich gravy and flaky bits of white meat smell like Thanksgiving.  I haven't tasted it yet, but if I do I'll update my review.

review/text: But i wont be buying any more variety packs from Amazon anymore, as they raised the price by $10. Too bad. I can get it local for much cheaper now.<br /><br />Tip for the people who have problems with the packages. Grab the package firmly above tear line, shake the package back and forth a few times until all the food and juices get pushed down to the bottom. Then open, hardly ever have the "squirt" or "dribble" anymore, after giving it the shakes.

review/summary: My picky cats love Purrfectly Fish
review/text: Having owned cats for about 4 years now, I know that they all have their likes and dislikes, just like any animal. With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over. I was glad to find that Amazon carries the tuna entree, so I know that my cats will eat it. Add in Subscribe & Save, and you have a winner.

review/summary: Great product for older cat
review/text: We found this product when we were looking for something to supplement my elderly cat's diet.  She had gotten pretty thin, had lost interest in eating, and had problems with keeping food down.  She went crazy for the chicken, and we started feeding her three times a day.  We had problems finding it locally until we located it on Amazon.  We liked the autoship option and signed up.  My little old lady has put on weight and is clearly feeling a lot better now that she has something that she likes to eat.

review/summary: My cats LOVE all 3 of the chicken flavors
review/text: I have four cats who all love any flavor in the purrfectly chicken multipack.  I always leave dry food out for them and only feed them the wet food twice a day, before I go to work and as soon as I get home.  Whenever they smell the food them come running to me, purr, and rug against my leg.  It is super cute.<br /><br />Although I agree with previous reviews it is a little annoying to open.  I cut the pouch open, empty the food onto a shallow bowl, and then spoon the rest of it out (definitly worth it, there is always ALOT left within the pouch), I then add a pouch full of water.<br /><br />Adding the water seemed to really help alot.  Adding the water made the wet cat food smell much less noticeable and helped to get the last pieces of chicken out of the pouch ( I add a tiny bit of water and shake it really good). My vet stressed that my cats needed to drink more water he was the one who suggested adding the water.

review/summary: Four Paws up
review/text: I have owned cats all my life, and over the years we have tried a variety of canned, dry and frozen foods with mixed results. So I feel fairly confident to provide a review of the Whiskas Purrfectly Fish line.  Here are my observations:<br />1.) ALL the cats I've given this to seemed to like it. Even my picky eater quickly devours the food, and now that we've switched back to this he will remind me if I am running late with dinner.<br />2.) From my point of view the image on the package is slightly misleading. Yes, there is obviously fish in there, but do not it expect it to be all slices. I say this because some of the newer cat food products out there, such as Fancy Feast Appetizers, do look like chicken or fish chunks. Rather it is a combination of mush food, fish slices and jelly.<br />3.) On the nice side, while it is fish based the smell is not over powering (I hate fish), so dishing it up is not overly offensive.<br />4.) It has also been my experience, that unlike most wet cat food that contains fish, I have yet to find the small bones.<br />5.) While my cats seem to like the Fancy Feast Appetizers much better, I like the price of these much better.  I can buy two of these for the price of one of those.<br />6.) Storage.  If you buy it in the packs or boxes, they are easy to store and it is compact.  If you buy them by the package in the store, you will need something to keep them from sliding around (they don't stack well like can do.)<br />7.) Easy to open for most.  For most people they will easily tear open.  However, I suspect some people with arthritis might have some difficulties gripping the package enough to tear.  The bonus about them being pouches is that there is no aluminum lid to cut yourself on.

review/text: This shelter kitty had tried it all but since being fed Whiskas Purrfectly chicken he won't consider anything else.  He prepares to eat if I offer somthing else but stops short of the bowl like he's sniffing his food and turns his head and walks away.  He won't eat any other of this brands products nor any other brand no matter how expensive. The pouch is not convenient but the fact that I know he will eat and enjoy his food makes up for it.

review/summary: Cats LOVE the food, I hate the mess of packaging...cats win.
review/text: I've had them try every type of Whiskas. . .this is hands down the best (this, meaning the Purrfectly Chicken, Chicken/Duck, Chicken/Beef). The purple packages don't even resemble meat so even though my cats will eat it, I didn't feel comfortable feeding it to them. The Purrfectly Fish makes a couple of my kitties violently ill (hence the neon pink vomit everywhere) but the Purrfectly chicken varieties seem to agree with all of them. No vomit, they eat a majority of the meat after lapping up all of the juices and grain free. My diabetic cat is no longer diabetic, and the fact that there is now a food in my home that everyone will eat is pretty amazing.<br /><br />My complaint - the packaging. I've tried the tip mentioned by others (storing them upside down) but there is just no way to get the pack open without a) having the juice squirt out on to one of the eager diners (though they don't let that slow them down), b) having the juice squirt and ooze all over my hands c) the juice splattering the wall d) me having to squeeze the package for the remaining bits of meat and juice as if I am milking a cow. I HATE feeding them because I always end up covered in chicken juice and bits and I know there is more in the package that I didn't successfully squeeze out. This in turn means that all of the pets will be trying to go through the trash when they are hungry looking for a few half squeezed packs so they can get another fix. There must be another interior material they could use for the packaging that would allow an easier 'release' of the food. . .Whiskas, you listening?

review/summary: Cats seem to prefer this brand
review/text: My 4 cats seem to prefer the "Whiskas Purrfectly" brand to any other wet food I've tried.  These fish flavors are not sliced; there are big blocks of pate in each sack that I have to break up with a knife so they can eat it.  My cats like this flavor set for a change, but really like the same brand in "Chicken" flavor, which is sliced.  If you have trouble with it splashing when you unzip each sack, try keeping a pair of scissors by your cat food area and cutting the bags; it's less messy and you can get more of the food into the cat bowl.

review/summary: great cat food
review/text: Whiska's Purrfectly Fish is a good quality food and our cat seems to really like it.  It is mostly fish with very little grain filler.  This is healthier for a cat as they are carnivores.  Some of the fish varieties have chunks of actual fish and others have a more mashed tuna-fish like appearance.  We found that the pouch is convenient - you can just tear it open and squeeze it out without using a fork.  It kinda pops out in a big  lump so it's not too messy.  Thankfully, even though it's fish, the smell is not too obnoxious.

review/summary: Not the best for your cat's long term health
review/text: I started buying these after another brand discontinued. I refuse to buy by-products for my cat so of course I was drawn to Puurfectly because it has real meat. The downside, 2 "magical" ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />Both useless to your cat and in my case eventually cause my cat to develop an allergy to corn and wheat. After a few months of her loving this food, she now refuses to touch it after throwing up repeatedly from it and having severe diarrhea.<br /><br />So now being more informed that corn and wheat aren't great for cats I've move on to natural cat foods. No more throwing up and a happy cat. Hooray! I suggest you do the same if you want to avoid vet bills and chronic health conditions in the long run.

review/text: We bought 2 packets (49 pouches in total) a few weeks ago for my 3 cats. One of the cats ignored this food completely to start with but the remaining two ate it. Anyways, a few days later we realized that both our cats who ate this food began throwing up in agony. Initially we didn't take it too seriously but they did this repeatedly two days in a row right after they ate this food. Hence, we have now switched back to the food we used to give them before and they are doing much better now.<br /><br />We also found that this food is NOT made in the USA but imported from Thailand, which they have not mentioned on this website.

review/summary: Purrfectly Chicken NOT!  Purrfectly Mystery Meat is better
review/text: Once upon a time Whiskas Purrfectly items were not too bad, our 3 cats loved them.  But the product has gone down hill, WAY DOWN HILL!<br /><br />The cats like an evening snack, and Whiskas was at the top of the list.  I used to go 3 days on, 1 day off (no treats).  This kept them eager.<br /><br />But today I failed to purchase any more.  Why?<br /><br />Here's why:  First, look at the picture on the pack,,,, see all that lovely white meat?  I DARE you to find even one package out of the whole box that matches that picture.  You will not find one.  Now all you find are bits and pieces of red / brown mystery meat, with perhaps, if you are REALLY lucky, 2 or 3 small slivers of white meat.<br /><br />The last box I tried was a total failure, the cats would look, sniff,,, tentatively lick the sauce and maybe nibble a piece of white meat if they could find it, and walk away, allowing me the pleasure of throwing it away.<br /><br />No more.  They need to take a serious look at this product.  DO NOT BUY!!

review/text: That's what my cat would say. This is the best food that I've found for my cat, and the extra cost shows it, but my cat's worth it! I was suprised to see the big chunks of real fish. I agree with other comments about the packaging, so it didn't take me long to figure out that if you use scissors to cut the top off instead of tearing it, you avoid all the mess. Just squeeze the contents away from the top first before you cut it. I actually prefer this package over a can, because since I give her half in the morning and half in the evening, I can just fold over the top and put the rest in the fridge. I have always bought the cheaper Whiska's pouches because, well, I'm a cheapskate. But at this point in both of our lives, I figure it's time to enjoy ourselves, and treat us both to the good stuff! Steak for me, Purffectly Fish/Chicken for her!

I am on subscribe & save for the FFG, but have been looking for a good wet cat food to provide some variety. The real meat in a pouch idea appeals to me. Got the 10-pack box today at local Petsmart for $5.99. My cat usually favors the chicken flavor so I opened the chicken packet first. Lots of juice and soft meat and smells more like human food(to human nose). My cat finished it in record time. Success!! We are going to try out other flavors like Seafood next. It did draw my attention that this product was made in Thailand. I am not sure if that should be a concern (?). And if your cat is like mine, who sometimes cannot finish the 3oz portion in a meal, just store it upright in a ziplock bag and put it in the fridge for the next meal.<br />-----<br />Follow up: After two boxes, my cat is not so enthusiastic about it anymore. He would lick all the juice up and leave the content (especially the red color meat) in his dish...:-( He also doesn't like the chicken & duck flavor. If they sell only the chicken soup for cats, my cat would love it. The seafood (especially) tuna was a success for the first and second time and then he just doesn't like it any more. But he still likes his fancy feast grilled. So I guess I have to keep searching for alternatives...

review/summary: Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Beef Pouches
review/text: My cats love this.  The meat does not look like chicken or beef to me. However the Whiskas "Cat Chefs" know what the kitty cats like.  My picky bunch love to pig down on it. I was even able to sneak in their monthly flea meds with it with no problem.  A first ! The only down side is the juice runs out on the top of the package when you open it. So I just snip the top a tiny bit first then, hold a second and pull open. No mess to clean up then.<br />Will purchase again.

review/text: I hope Whiskas never stops making Purrfectly Fish Tuna Entree.  It is the only wet food that I can get my cat to eat.  I've tried just about every other brand and flavor of wet cat food, and he refuses everything else.  But these pouches of tuna are different for some reason.  And Amazon's subscription service gives me a discount, and saves me a trip to the store!

I'd buy it again if there was no other choice. But if there is tuna, I'd go for that instead.

review/summary: Whiskas Tuna Entree for Cats
review/text: After Wal-mart discontinued the tuna packets product from Whiskas I turned to Amazon and found that I could purchase this product by the case (24).  This has been the best wet food our cat has ever had, and this is how we deliver his medicine, pulverized into the tuna!  He is a picky eater and has rejected every other wet product we have found.  So, I am very happy with this product and by subscribing for an automatic monthly delivery, using Amazon Prime, I am saving money and paying less than I did at Wal-mart.  Amazon Prime takes care of the postage and the automatic subscription saved me even more.  I know I sound like a shill, but I am a happy cat owner.

review/summary: my cat prefers this over the other Whiskas brands
review/text: My cat is a fussy eater.  I have to cycle between two or three different varieties of cat food in order to keep her happy - and eating!  She'd much rather yowl all day long, than eat the same meal twice in a row.<br /><br />So, when I discovered that she actually likes all three flavors of this Whiskas Purrfectly Fish variety pack, I was very pleased.  (Incidentally, she doesn't like two of the flavors in the other Purrfectly fish variety pack, but oh well...)  Also, this is a pretty good price for 4 packs of 10 pouches.<br /><br />I would have been happy to give this food five stars, except for a few minor issues.  For starters, pouches are always difficult to open and the food inside tends to often be messy to serve.  I've often gotten my hands splattered in juice, whilst I'm trying to feed a hungry cat.<br /><br />The major issue I have with the food is that it comes in one big piece.  When you open the pouch, it kinda slithers out - which is a bit less messy than feeding chunks (and at least all of the meat does come out of the pouch) but my cat won't eat this stuff until I chop it up for her.  Usually, that's not easy when she likes to shove her head in the bowl and start licking up the juice.<br /><br />She'll probably tire of this brand given a few more months, but for now, she definitely really likes it and I appreciate that I have three varieties of flavor to offer her.

review/text: Cats can be very finicky when they want to be, my cat will not eat 9 lives, friskies and only a few flavors of Fancy Feast so I have one spoiled cat!! But it seems to love Whiskas Chicken and Duck. Cats are very smart and have good hearing when he heard the UPS truck and saw me bring in this big box he knew his favorite Chicken and Duck was in the box. When I mixed the Whiskas Chicken and Duck with his Whiskas dry about 10 minutes later he licked his plate clean. So instead of wasting money on food he does not like I am sticking with his Chicken and Duck.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NIJ4A">Whiskas Purrfectly Chicken & Duck in Natural Juices Food for Cats, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>

review/text: I was interested in this food and so was my cat until she got ill from two magical ingredients:<br /><br />Corn Starch-Modified, Wheat Gluten<br /><br />They do absolutely nothing for your cat but can cause health issues. She did a lot of throwing up and had the runs so I immediately switched to a natural canned cat food, all back to normal - no more sickness.<br /><br />My even greater concern with these flavors is the tuna/salmon - not only are you feeding them things they can't really process{wheat/corn} but your also feeding them a daily dose of mercury. Worth it?? You tell me when you get the vet bills that could have rather been spent on good food.

They watch me prepare each of their dishes with great interest. They follow me as I place their dishes out for them, and then dive in with great gusto. They did not do this when I served competing National Brands. My Cats also love Wiskas dry Cat Food which I make available to them 24 hours a day in a special serving bowl for that. My Cats enjoy good health, abundant energy, and a happy spirit. I am glad that I am able to serve them food that they enjoy and provides nutritional benefits they need.

We were getting down to the wire and the kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away. I tried several kittens formulas and KMR-  and they wouldn't eat anything because they preferred nursing.  However,  when I brought this flavor of Whiskas out all 8 of them gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving.  I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require  but there must be something to this formula for the kittens to take to it that well!

review/text: Okay, so I admit I spoil my cat.  These Whiskas Purrfectly Tuna pouches are hit with my furry kiddos. The pouches are easily to open, just simply grasp at the notch and twist.  The food is relatively easy to get out of the package.  I found it easier to massage the bags first before opening to mix the filling up, otherwise you'll end up with one blob of congealed cat food.  Sometimes I'll still need to use a fork to separate and clean out the pouch.<br /><br />These pouches per ounce maybe more expensive than some of the other canned food, but the convenience of not using a can opener and easy at putting the food in the bowl are worth the extra nickel or two you might save.<br /><br />Truth wise, my cats love the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00283K02K">Fancy Feast Appetizers for Cats, Chicken & Beef, 2-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 12)</a> and if given a taste test would probably prefer, but at about $1.46 per tub, they don't get to eat it very often.

review/text: I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.

review/summary: what one should expect at the price
review/text: there is nothing spectacular going on here-  there is precious little of even truffle going on here.  these will not adequately "truffle" eggs or appropriately spike beef wellington.  but goddamned, the jar is tasty to dip into for snacks.<br /><br />the bottom line is that this is the bottom line for truffles.  there are no truffles available for less that are even worth considering, and if you want to explore their culinary possibilities you're wasting your time looking for deals.<br /><br />if you are occasionally as fiscally irresponsible as i am, you might buy a bottle of these things to munch on.  if you want truffles for their true magnificence and their viability in culinary application, you'll spend more elsewhere.

review/summary: Some Aroma, Very Little Taste
review/text: The Urbani Summer Truffle Carpaccio in a 2.5 ounce jar was going  to be a special gourmet treat for me and my wife to top a little bit of bread as a snack or alongside a meal.  Instead, I ended up with a bland mushroom-like topping that does little other than look appealing.  The texture of the carpaccio is pleasing and there is some definite truffle aroma if you take a big whiff from the jar.  The packing oil seems pleasant enough as well.  Really, the only thing lacking is the main event.  Sadly, I cannot recommend this product at all.  I would recommend checking out some truffle salt instead.

review/summary: Not that tasty alone, but with add-ins it's useful to keep around
review/text: There's an after-taste I can't quite recognize and don't quite like when I try to heat just a plate of this Vegetable Pulao by itself, but when I heat it up with additional vegetables (especially nice green frozen peas, since the peas in any of these ready-to-eat entrees are inevitably faded to gray by the time they're re-heated, and it's the work of a few minutes to chop up fresh carrots, bell peppers, garlic, broccoli, or whatever else you have on hand, to mix in before microwaving) and throw in a few additional cashews, it's much better.  It's better still with a nice, spicy stir-fry or heat-and-eat curry served over top.<br /><br />I might not re-order, but I won't have trouble using up what I have of this product.

review/summary: coffee mate creamer pump malfunctions
review/text: i love coffeemate in the pump. i've been using it for yrs.  drinking coffee is my only vice... however the last two creamers i bought, @ sam's clum, the pumps malfunctioned... they simply stopped pumping... they lost compression and were pushing out air. the 1st time i only had 1/4 of the creamer remaining and just poked a hole in the container and poured in another container;  however, this morning 2/19/11 my current container, 3/4 full, totally stopped working UGH!! so my 'mac gyver' husband pulled the pump apart (he loves fixing stuff, he finds great satifaction repairing things)and was able to jerry rig it so it would compress and pump again. halleluia!! hoping it w/continue working until it's empty!!

review/summary: Product is Perfect But Delivery System (Pump) Needs Work
review/text: I work from home and traditional 'home' products don't work for me.  They are also more expensive and wasteful.<br /><br />My coffee solution is a plumed-in Bunn commercial coffee-maker, air-pot and this creamer.  I've experienced eventual clogging of the pump before each bottle is empty and resorted to another container to pour it from.<br />Nestle should source a STAINLESS, commercial grade pump that can be disassembled for cleaning periodically and re-utilized.  This will decrease product cost and also cut down on plastic waste.<br />Here's something that works for the pump:  When installing a new pump: 1. Hold the top part of the shaft (just under the cap) in one hand while using the other to turn the pump so that it pops up.  2.DO NOT tighten the cap more than about 1 turn.  This will give the pump enough stability to use, but I've found that this process prevents the pump from plugging up.  It may be due to air flowing in from the cap vs. through the pump, gradually thickening & drying the product and plugging the pump up.

review/text: Like most people, I was very skeptical about purchasing baklava online. From my experience, if one leaves out baklava out for a long time, it tends to get extremely hard and the honey drips all over the place. Not the case with this baklava. I received it in the mail a few days ago (I live in University housing and the mail system here takes a couple days to process) and the baklava tastes fantastic. Fresher baklava of course tastes slightly better, but I don't think it could get all that much better than this in terms of mail-order baklava. Highly recommended.

review/text: A small guilty please I got on sale. I received it about a week and a half ago. I was surprised at the size of the box and tray the thirty pieces were packaged in. Very, very generous sized pieces.<br /><br />So, I'm trying to save it by eating a piece or two at a time. Savor the flavor, since it has been quite some time since I've had any baklava. And, oh my, is this ever good baklava!<br /><br />My suggestion is to put the box in the refrigerator. Take it out at least 20 - 30 minutes before you indulge. That way it brings these wonderful pieces to room temperature and the flavor comes back to full richness.<br /><br />So, as I said, I'm trying to save it but ... the last fifteen pieces keep calling out to me.<br /><br />DO try this baklava. It is really quite special.

review/summary: Good, but not what I was hoping for.
review/text: I have long been a fan of Baklava.  Of course, everyone has their own idea of what constitues good baklava, and there are regional differences.  The best baklava I've had was when I was in Athens. Athens baklava was moist (not crispy) with plenty of dripping syrup and a hint of honey; there were 3 layers of nuts which were firm but not crunchy and there were subtle overtones of cinnamon and allspice (I think) and a hint of citrus zest. Fabulous!<br />This Shatila Mediterranean-Mideast baklava is disappointing: the single nut layer is moist, but the philo layers are crispy and mostly dry but have a strong butter-like flavor, and a greasy consistency (a-la butter flavored crisco?) There is a single layer of nuts which lacks spice or complex flavors...mostly just nutty; it is mildly sweet, less so than most baklava; no real syrup to speak of...just tastes sweet without even a hint of honey.  It tastes ok, but not what I was hoping for.  Seems fresh, and delivery was quick. Just my 2 cents.

review/text: I purchased this product for my husband as a birthday gift in early in December 1910 because he loves baklawa.and I don't bake.  We were very pleased, it was delicious, my first purchase was the whole sheet walnut based flavor and the second was a 1/2 sheet of the walnut and 1/2 sheet of the pistachio.  Both were excellent but we prefer walnuts.  I have since placed three more orders and intend to continue ordering from time to time each order was of AONE quality.  The price is right and the pieces are the perfect size for a little snack of sweets.  The only complaint (?) I have is that it was so good it went too fast and I never had to refrigerate it.<br /><br />Try it as Martha Stewart would say "It's a good thing"!

review/text: For a Mediterranean who tried almost EVERY single brand in at least 7 different countries, I can say this IS the best so far. The size of the pieces is small compared to the other brands, but it's medium compared to the original ones we have back home. The package says they last 2 weeks unrefrigerated, ours stayed perfect for 6 weeks BUT we kept them well tied inside a plastic bag. They taste delicious, we already tried the Baklawa (Baklava) and the Burma (Mabroome), both were great and I'm ordering different things to try them all. My husband surprised his students with a big box of Baklawa, they all loved it. Don't miss it and don't let the negative reviews effect on your decision, and treat yourself with a piece of Baklawa & a cup of coffee! :)

review/text: The service was terrific.  Fast, efficient, and communicative.  The price was reasonable.  And the baklava itself was good, but not great or terrific.  Unlike some baklavas that are highly spiced or 90% phyllo, this one has a nice thick layer of nuts and has a nice flavor.  However, since it doesn't have honey, it misses the mark for me.  I just love the gooey sweetness of honeyed baklava.  So for me, it was okay, but for 170 calories per small piece, not worth it.<br /><br />I am torn between 3 and 4 stars, but will give 4 for the service.

review/summary: Doesn't taste like authentic Greek Baklava
review/text: I just spent time in Greece last month, one of many places I visited along the Mediterranean and Aegean Sea.  I was also in the Middle East (Israel).  And I can tell you, this does NOT even compare to the real stuff.<br /><br />This Baklava is very, very dry and very conservative on the quantity and quality of ingredients.  It lacks flavor big time!  And the pieces are so small they are bite size.  The nuts are minced so fine you can't even tell they are nuts.  Instead it's like a dry, pasty filling with little flavor.<br /><br />In Greece, the pieces are large (huge compared to what you get with this), overflowing with the moist, nutty filling, very flavorful, with lots of honey, spices, and phyllo.  I had Baklava purchased at a bakery on Patmos Island, Greece that blows this Baklava out of the water by far.<br /><br />I won't be buying from here again.  I'll keep looking elsewhere.<br /><br />I gave two stars for packaging and speed.  If I only had to rate the product itself, it would've gotten zero stars.

review/text: Local grocery and convenience stores sell Reese's peanut butter cups for about $1 for a two-pack. So when I saw that they were on sale here on Amazon for less than $1 each for packs of four, I was thrilled. However, the feeling has since eroded after noticing a couple of issues:<br /><br />1) Another reviewer said that the candy comes nearly stale, and I have to agree partially. The packages are almost expired (in just 6 months), but from what I can tell, the taste still seems OK (for me).<br /><br />2) There is weird condensation on each peanut butter cup. This is strange because where I am now there is super low humidity (just 26% with fire watches). So I am not sure where the condensation came from but the box does say to store in a cool DRY place.<br /><br />Other than those two things, I cautiously tried a taste test and they do seem OK. If you are looking for ultra-fresh, you may be better off shopping somewhere local. But if you'll give these away or your family goes through them fast, then maybe it's worth the low price. I don't think I will buy again, though.

review/text: I had ordered this product before and found it very fresh.  But this shipment included bars loosely packed in a box other than the one supplied by the manufacturer, and included bars that had reached their expiration date.

review/text: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F9Z1WS">Planters Peanut Butter Cookie Crisps 100 Calorie Packs, 6-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  These cookies are so tasty!  I love the peanut taste and the crispness.  A one-hundred calorie pack is just enough to get started having fun eating them, but then the limitation of the size of the package helps me put the brakes on.  Probably the most important part of weight control is portion control.<br /><br />The cookies have 3 grams fat, 0 mg Cholesterol, and 2 Weight Watchers points.

review/summary: 3.5* snack for a non-chocophile
review/text: It's very nice that the company put 100 calories packages out--great marketing idea.  They taste okay to me.  A bit subtle on the chocolate IHMO.  Mostly they're lightly-flavored, chocolate, wheat crackers.  They have very little nutritional value but over 39% sugar.  The 100 calories is achieved by a very light product--it doesn't weigh much.  So, 100 calories sounds great--but only if you eat but one package.  Not easy to do if you're hungry.  Still, it's a convenient snack to put in a backpack, lunch box, carry-on (now that they don't feed you much when you fly), etc. with less calories than most alternatives.  Could also tide you over between meals.  Still, I'd personally prefer something a bit healthier.  But that's why there's chocolate & vanilla--oops, they left out the vanilla!

review/text: I enjoy them a lot and so does my son. I have to say that this kind is one of my favorites. It is full of peanut butter flavor that you forget that it is only 100 cals. As for the amount you get in the bag, it is more than I expecting so I was very happy.

review/summary: The portable and edible Oreo
review/text: One reviewer writes that these are Oreo crackers without the creme--and they are right! These thin Oreo crisp wafer type cookies by Nabisco are easy to pack for when you're on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion. They also make for snacking anytime of the day--or night--and they give you that great Oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient.<br /><br />These crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free--hooray!  There are only 100 calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat. They are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy French fries. These crackers somehow manage to give you the full Oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories, too. Excellent!<br /><br />These Oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy. This makes them even more portable for both children and adults. Another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre-measured to contain only 100 calories. This way you can't accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have.<br /><br />I notice that these crackers are made with cocoa. Please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine. Chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that.<br /><br />I recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack. They should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy. They make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and/or cholesterol.<br /><br />Buy some and enjoy them today!

review/text: I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack.

review/summary: Flavor in, Calories Down, Fat Nearly Out
review/text: As I get older and fatter, I seek opportunities to eat snacks that at least make a nominal attempt to be healthy.  Oreo cookies fail to reach very high on my list of healthy foods.  However, Oreo cookies are delicious beyond belief.  Not only are Oreo cookies delicious, but I sometimes think I hear Oreo cookies calling my name as I walk by them.  Honest.  I am unable to buy Oreo cookies because if I do I know I will eat them; generally in a few days.  Not a good idea.<br /><br />Nabisco, realizing that many of us are making some nominal attempt at eating more healthy foods, have created a brand-identified snack eliminates all the bad fats and most of the fat, creating a yummy and crunchy chocolate wafer snack that is like a chocolate cracker.  To this point no one has ever created a truly healthy snack that is like a cookie.  However, this wafer snack, which Nabisco has decided not to call a cookie, perhaps because cookie sounds fattening, is reasonably yummy.  I have eaten these things several times and still eat them.  I actually eat them more than regular Oreos, which I count as quite a nod to health.<br /><br />You may be tempted to add icing to this baked cookie.  If you are going to add the fat and calories in icing, perhaps you should just skip in pretense at reducing calories and fat and go straight to regular Oreo cookies.  In fact, just revel in the calories and go for the Double Stuff Oreos.<br /><br />Oreos have been around since 1912, and remain the best-selling cookie brand in history.  According to our friends at Kraft, which owns Nabisco, and which is owned by the Altria Group (renamed from Philip Morris, presumably for marketing reasons), more then 450 billion Oreo cookies were sold in the first 90 years of their existence.  Though Oreo Thin Crisps fall quite a bit short of the real thing, they are high quality and have sufficient flavor that allows these baked chocolate wafers to have the Oreo name.<br /><br />Of course, you could just stick with rabbit food and be truly healthy, but where is the fun in that?  For those of us that find a constant diet of veggies to be just too healthy to be fun, and yet the thought of pigging out on a pound of Oreos smacks of chunks of fat floating through our circulatory system, Oreo Thin Crisps are a lovely alternative.  Or course, you probably should avoid eating pounds of these, even with the reduced fat.  Food is food and too much low fat food still is not good for you, even if it tastes good.  At least Oreo Thin Crisps do not talk to me when I walk by.<br /><br />Enjoy!

review/summary: Now we have the Oreo transformed into a baked chocolate wafer snack
review/text: We are still six years away from the centennial for the Oreo cookie, which was first manufactured by Nabisco in 1912 as something more exciting for people to dip in their tea than the biscuits the English tend to use (it was copyrighted as the "Oreo Biscuit").  The sandwich cookie was quite similar to the Hydrox cookie produced by Sunshine, but Oreo dominated the market to such an extent that they stopped making Hydrox back in 1996. What would be considered the "modern" Oreo cookie was developed in 1952 (originally they were mound shaped, which is why some think the name comes from the Greek word for "hill"), with the two circular chocolate wafers with the sweet white filling commonly called the "cream" in between.<br /><br />Of course today consumers do not have to restrict themselves to just the tradition Oreo cookie.  There are Oreos with chocolate-flavored cream instead of the traditional white, as well as orange colored cream at Halloween and red at Christmas.  You can get Oreos with a double portion of filling, not to mention mixing and matching two flavors of filling (carmel and chocolate, coffee and cream, peanut butter and chocolate, etc.).  You want the original cookie with a coating of chocolate fudge?  They have that, or with white chocolate fudge in winter, and then there is the Uh-Oh! Oreo with the flavors of the cookie reversed.<br /><br />But what if you are interested in watching your weight because once you open a bag of which ever type of Oreos are your personal preference they are just sitting them beginning to be eating?  After all, once they are open they could go stale, and putting them in a cookie jar just makes them more accessible even if it allays fears about freshness.  Nabisco has taken a three-prong approach for weight watching Oreo lovers.  You can go with the Reduced Fat Oreo, which is identical to the size of the original but has less fat per serving.  Then there are the Mini Oreos, bite-sized versions packaged in snack packs rather than in really think wrapped trays.  Now we can add to that short list the Oreo Thin Crisps.<br /><br />These are baked chocolate six-sided wafer snacks, almost 20 to a pack, that are lightly sprinkled with white specks that are to take the place of the aforementioned cream.  Now, I am someone who likes the cream more than the wafer, so I was wary because I thought scarffing down a bunch of these would be like eating the chocolate wafers without the white cream, but they are lighter in taste than that, even without having the glass of milk handy that I considered essentially when eating the more traditional Oreo cookies.  Since they do have the Oreo taste I can round up on these.  These come in 100 Calorie Packs, to help you draw the line at a nice round number when it comes to caloric intake.  You can six 0.81 oz (23g) packs in a 4.86 oz box.  Each pack contains 0 grams of trans-fat, 2 grams of fat, and 0 milligrams of cholesterol.  You will also find one of 100 Healthy Living Tips on the front of the pack (e.g., #56: "Make a meal out of appetizers or side dishes instead of larger main entrees").  Of course, I was thinking of putting some of these in a bowl of vanilla ice cream, but that would really mess up the whole healthy living bit.

review/summary: not as good as the 100-calorie Oreos
review/text: With any low fat or low calorie food, you're going to sacrifice taste of portion size.  With this product, you sacrifice both.<br /><br />It's a good idea, which was done well with the Oreos and others in this series of "100 calorie" snacks, but I think you're better off with a single cookie from the regular Chips Ahoy box than a whole bag of these.
