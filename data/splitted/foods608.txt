review/summary: Truely the best
review/text: These really work amazing!!! The ink showed up perfect on the chocolate I was trying to write on! Before I bought these, I bought another brand that did not show up at all and cost the same price. I looked up the best kind of edible ink pens there was and these won everytime! I would never buy anything else; these were worth every penny!!!

review/summary: Worked Perfect for Marshmallow Pops!
review/text: I got these pens to use on candy coated marshmallows.  We made minifigure heads for a Lego themed party.  They worked perfectly!  We rarely needed to wipe the pens off between use.  I do think the key though was the fact that the coating had plenty of time to dry and harden before we tried drawing on them.  I used melted colored candy bark for the coating.  After they were chilled thoroughly, I decorated with the pens without any problems.  The kids had fun creating their own designs.

review/text: this Markers are great, they smoothly write in fondant, gum paste and even chocolate! they arrived on time and the only reason why they did not get the 5 stars is because they need to be cleaned often while working with chocolate, the tip scrapes the chocolate a bit when you write and if left without cleaning, it won't write.<br />These are great for details on cake pops, they work wonderfully on candy melts.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: A few weeks ago I managed to snag a Capri Sun variety pack with different flavors at a local grocery store and liked some more than others. I was not very happy with Cherry, Pacific Cooler, or Lemomade. This Red Berry went on sale here on Amazon a few days ago so I bought some and once I received it I immediately threw a box in the fridge. After they got cold I tried one and it is delicious! Compared to the cherry flavor this Red Berry flavor is excellent. I didn't notice any bad aftertaste and I was satisfied with less than a pouch, which is rare for me. I'll definitely be ordering more as at least for now this is my favorite.

review/summary: Saved a lot of money by switching to Amazon
review/text: We usually by this at the grocery store for about 3.50 a bottle when it is on sale.  I saw this deal when looking to add some items to my cart so I would hit the free super saver shipping but wasn't sure if it was a 6 pack like the title states or a 2 pack like the picture states.  I figured that since it was in the title I would take a chance on it, and I'm glad I did.  I paid 13.90 for 6, which is only 2.31 a piece.<br />My main reason to write a review was for the good price.  Though, as for the spice itself, if you have never used it you have to start using it.  It works on anything, and I mean that.  While I have never used it on something like ice cream or cereal, I can't imagine that it would make it worse.  The spice is made from poblano peppers, so if you have ever had them you know that it isn't hot spicy, just enough to add a hint of spice.  But what it does add is a lot of flavor.  Try using in a dry rub for wings, or in an asian dish.  I've been using is a lot on our strombolis as of late, and I probably won't ever stop.<br /><br />Don't go with a non-brand name on this spice either, it isn't worth the lower quality.

review/summary: Not weathertight as I hoped, but works great
review/text: I picked this to replaced another brand charger that had gotten wet and shorted out when the enclosure it was in developed a leak.  I chose this charger because the manufacture's website says "...terminals have been moved to the bottom of the unit for added protection against direct rain."  I understood this to mean that the unit was weather-tight, and could be out in the rain.  Not true.  The instructions with the charger specify mounting it someplace protected from the weather.  Sigh...  I built a box for it to protect it from the rain and it seems to work great.  I only wish someone made a water-tight unit I can just mount outside!

review/text: Used it for about 2 months now.  Use it to keep away animals out of the vegetable garden.  Didn't want to mess with weaker chargers so I got this charger for medium size garden and it does an excellent job keeping animals away.  More powerful than I need but just what I needed to ensure some of the weeds don't short the fence.  3 lights show how much energy is going through the wires which is convenient.  The charger also clicks when it discharges to the line.  It's not very loud but noticeable. Recommended product.

review/summary: Crunchy Cookie with a Hint of Chocolate and Orange
review/text: Pepperidge Farm is one of the few national companies that mass markets distinctive cookies.  One of those cookies is the marvelous Orange Milano cookie.  When you bite into this crunchy cookie you get a hint of chocolate as you reach the center, and as you chew the orange flavor spreads throughout your mouth.  Yet, none of the flavors is overwhelming.  The problem with Orange Milano cookies is that it is hard to stop after eating only one.<br /><br />These cookies are relatively expensive compared to other brands.  However, one of the hallmarks of Pepperidge Farm from the beginning of the company in the 1930s is quality.  For an alternative to the sweeter cookies typically available in the cookie isle, try Pepperidge Farm's cookies.  If you are looking for a good cookie to try first, this one is a winner.

review/summary: The name says it all
review/text: Kuding translates to "bitter nail" and honestly that really tells you a lot about the taste.  I drink this tea really from the perspective that you don't drink this tea for the taste, but the health benefits.  My knowledge on traditional medicine is really limited so I'll not go into it so that I'm not misleading anyone - but effectively this tea is supposed to help with too much body heat which manifests in a few different ways.  Drinking this tea tends to "cool" your body down and is supposed to help balance the fact that most people's diets do not include much that is bitter.  I found personally that after drinking this tea I tend to sweat less, and it helps me feel better.  The taste is something that will throw off most people, so I wouldn't advise this to most, it's incredibly bitter, but if you start with one nail and work your way up, you won't be overpowered.  The other thing is drink this tea while it's hot, it makes it much more bearable.

review/summary: Chinese food at home
review/text: This seasoning is just like my favorite Chinese takeout dish: hot and spicy shrimp, which is usually served with a ton of chopped onion and hot rice. Delicious. It's sort of reminiscent of sweet and sour sauce but with a spicy kick.<br /><br />Very easy to make. I made mine with onion (just like the restaurants). For it to be really, really tasty, be sure NOT to overcrowd the shrimp. They have a lot of water, and you don't want that water to get into the sauce and dilute it to soup. I cooked mine in a very hot wok seasoned with oil...got a bit of char on a few of the shrimp which added to the flavor...then removed the shrimp and added some diced onions and when that was cooked, popped the shrimp back in and added the seasoning and thickener per instructions.<br /><br />There wasn't a bite leftover; it was that good.

review/summary: a tasty topping for your popped treat
review/text: I've been buying Hawaiian Hurrican Toppings since I discovered it about two years ago. It really adds a nice taste to your own popped corn.<br /><br />The envelopes include:<br /><br />-plastic shaking bag<br />-mochi crunch (nori pieces, japanese crackers, sesame seeds)<br />-butter-flavored topping<br /><br />The preparation couldn't be simpler! While your bagged popcorn is popping in the microwave (or you can also use stove-top, air, or machine popped plain corn), open the kit. Take the plastic shaking bag out and unfurl it. Pour in the mochi crunch. Once your popcorn is done popping, allow it to cool for a minute. Then transfer it into the plastic shaking bag. Shake to mix the mochi crunch into the popcorn. Then open the shaking bag and add the butter-flavored topping. The butter-flavored topping is sufficient for buttery topping lovers, however I only use half to three-quarters of it at most.<br /><br />Then shake the bag again to coat the butter-flavored topping onto the dry popcorn and mochi crunch mix.<br /><br />Pour out into a bowl or eat straight from the bag.<br /><br />Yum yum yum!

I think I assumed I'd be getting a good deal since I bought it on Amazon, but it's easily 2x the cost of competitors and since you're only getting 12 cans, it works out to more than $2 a can. I wish I hadn't bought this on an impulse even though my cat loves it. It would have been significantly less expensive for me to patronize the pet food shop down the street. Just goes to show Amazon doesn't always offer the best deal.

review/text: Although the flowers were delivered in a very timely manner, they looked nothing like picture. I was expecting the roses to be very full and instead they arrived looking like a bouquet I could've bought at 7-11. For the price I paid for roses and delivery I was kinda expecting perfection....

review/summary: Excellent organic soy-free chocolate chips but find another vendor.
review/text: These are the best organic chocolate chips I can find without soy. Strange because Sunspire puts soy in their semi-sweet chips but not their bittersweet chips. DO NOT buy from Vitacost. They offer free shipping after $49 but their inventory is very old and close to expiration dates on every single thing I have ever ordered from them. Which pretty much defeats the point of stocking up. I cancelled my account with Vitacost and was not pleased to see them showing up on Amazon as the only vendor for many of my favorite items. I think Bangella is better but more expensive. Best to buy in local stores if you can. That way you are assured of the expiration dates.

review/text: Why, oh why, oh WHY?! Don't we have such great tasting crisp like these in the USA!!! Walkers produce AMAZING crisps! 'Lays' can't stand up to the deliciousness that is Walkers. Please Walkers, start importing these into America! At least teach your parent company PepsiCo how to make great snacks so they can in turn teach the Americans how to make a great crisps!<br /><br />Half my life has been in the UK the other half is in America.. I have NEVER eaten a crisp so tasty as these, and I have NEVER eaten anything similar! Makes me wanna fly to London just to get a bag just looking at the picture lol!

review/text: I've been craving this flavor during my pregnancy, so I was very excited to see these crisps on here for such a great price!  I ordered two sets of six (12 total packets) and they arrived within a week.  They were well packaged and protected for shipping, so the actual crisps were not broken into dust.  My only complaint was the price of the shipping - I think I would order them again if it weren't for the extra cost.

I thought that the package had been lost and contacted the seller, got an immediate response and offer to re-send, no questions asked, no additional shipping!? I was gobsmacked! Anyway, the original package had showed up on time, my mate as too busy stuffing her face with Walkers Prawn cocktaily deliciousness to let me know so I didnt need the re-send, but so nice to deal with a seller that wants to please the customer! Will definitely buy from them again!

review/summary: Excellent tea, but iced tea instructions are suspect
review/text: For some odd reason, the instructions on the inside flap of the box say to make iced tea at HALF the strength (1 tea bag per 16 ounces of water) of hot tea.  This is backwards from all other teas (that recommend making iced tea at the same strength as, or at double the strength of, hot tea) that I normally encounter.<br /><br />For my first experiment, I tried making unsweetened tea (as per other reviews) using only 4 bags (as per the box).  It was OK, but not much better than unsweetened tea made with the Stash peach black tea that I can get locally.<br /><br />For my second experiment, I tried using 6 tea bags, a 5 minute steeping time, 1/3 cup of sugar (more than I normally use), and plenty of pre-chilled water and ice.  The resulting tea was absolutely delicious.  If my calculations are correct, it had 32 calories per 8 ounces, and yet it tasted just about as sweet (and maybe even more flavorful) than commercial sweet peach teas weighing in at three times the calorie count.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of this tea (other than the instructions), it's the total price.  When you add in shipping, you almost double the effective price of a single box.  I suspect that if you want to enjoy this tea on a regular basis, the most cost-effective way to do so is to purchase multiple boxes at a time so that the shipping cost can be spread out over them.

review/summary: When it's a macadamia...brand name matters!
review/text: I bought the Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macs with sea salt in Hawaii. They were so darn good, I wanted more, but they were very expensive in the supermarket. So, I ordered the 6-pack through Amazon.<br /><br />Not sure why, but the estimated ship time was a few weeks off and I had a hankering for macs. So, I bought a cheaper brand at the supermarket. They were awful; absolutely no flavor. I tried again with a mid-priced brand -- same problem. These I returned to the market.<br /><br />Then, I test-tasted one at Whole Foods. Awful.<br /><br />I started to think that maybe I wasn't remembering it right. Maybe these Mauna Loa macs weren't all that good. Then, finally, they arrived. Oh, my goodness! This is what a mac is supposed to taste like! Fresh, flavorful, just the right amount of salt.<br /><br />These are absolutely the best and, to date, I have not found a substitute. Store brand peanuts...sure. Store-brand -- or any other brand -- macadamia nut? Heck no!

review/text: Macadamias are my favourite nuts. They are not easy to found. Costa Rica is producing macadamian nuts by the Britt Coffee Company and is sold in the USA and in many Duty Free Shops at airports. There are macadamian nuts from Australia too. They are, in general, nice and well presented. But the Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with sea salt are the utmost. They are perfect. They should be used as a benchmark to assess quality.<br />Enjoy Mauna Loa Macadamias

review/summary: Go Nuts Trying To Find These!
review/text: Mauna Loa has excellent name recognition in the snack nut market for decades. However, it is always challenging to insure that their products are fresh because Mauna Loa still insists on placing cryptic embossed alphanumeric codes on the bottom of each can which makes it nearly impossible to insure you are receiving fresh product (despite Mauna Loa's insistence to the contrary). I would contact Mauna Loa (now owned by Hershey Foods), register your vote for making an easy to read "fresh through" or better still, "Produced on" date MANDATORY for all food products. While on the phone, ask them to decipher your can codes and provide you with a code deciphering" sheet until they do the right thing. You can find their toll free number listed on each can or package they sell. These cans are nearly impossible to find on grocer's shelves in the U.S. mainland,due to shelf space limitations and competitive slotting fees in the supermarkets. Nevertheless, they are still in my opinion, the best quality macadamia nuts on the market if you are a nut aficionado like myself. I now only purchase them through Amazon via subscription to insure a continuous supply and avoid "macadamia nut withdrawal"! Enjoy!

I am not planning to use it every day, so I pour from the bottle, which drips a little without having one of those internal dripless plastic inserts.  The flavor is great.  The aroma is fairly mild.  I probably won't buy again as it is $23 for 33 tablespoons of olive oil, a little out of my comfort range for how much to spend on food items for me.  But it was nice to try, and many people rave about this olive oil.

review/text: Maybe I got a bad or old batch, but this tea does not taste good to me. It has a strange color like it was added to the tea and the tea leaves don't plump up like most oolong/wulong teas I've had. I've been drinking wulong teas for years, but it's pretty expensive. I tried going cheaper this time and it didn't work out for me.

review/summary: I'm just a tad worried...
review/text: I'm a bit hesitant to actually use them as they did not come in a sealed package. They came in a unmarked small plastic jar with a piece of sloppily cut paper listing the ingredients. I would have like to have know this before purchasing the item. BUT I guess I'm a risk taker...I'm going to taste test them and if I wake up in the morning, they'll be on cupcakes at my son's birthday party next month because they are VERY CUTE!

review/summary: Item is great but very concerned. . . .
review/text: First I want to say that this company has fabulous customer service!  My item was originally lost/delayed in the mail due to no fault of the seller's.  They were quick to respond to my concern, and sent another item to ensure that the sprinkles would make it in time for my daughter's birthday.  But here is my concern (and it is a big one!) - the sprinkles came in an unsealed, unlabeled jar that just had a slip of paper with the ingredients hastily scotch taped to the bottle.  I now see that this was also the case with another reviewer's item.  I will not be willing to use these sprinkles - even though they are exactly what I was expecting and wanted - because I have no idea where they came from or who has had contact with them!  I am not willing to give these to a group of toddlers and their parents.  So basically I paid for something that I will not be using.  And if I attempt to return them to the seller, will they just resell them to another person without knowing if I could have opened the item and touched them?  This is just nasty.  I am very disappointed, especially since it is too late to order something similar to this for my daughter's party.

review/text: After many years of not being able to find Atora suet in our rural area of Australia I finally looked on the Internet to see if I could find suppliers of this product anywhere in this area.<br /><br />What I did discover was that it could be purchased through Amazon!!!!  As I use Amazon a lot for my ebooks, I decided to  try ordering the Atora through them.  Would it work - Amazon in America - the Atora required in Australia!!!<br /><br />Just over a week later I had 4 pack of Atora suet!!!!  The product is as good as it has always been - and I have a very happy husband who now is getting a Steak and Kidney Pudding every couple of weeks, which he loves and had missed for so long!!!<br /><br />Thank you Atora and thank you Amazon !!!!!

review/summary: Not the same
review/text: OK, I love the Szeged Paprika, hot or sweet.<br />However, in the last ten (10)years these tins are NOT real Hungarian Parkika!<br />It's tastless and most cases it's OLD stock, or Chinese mixed with Hungarian. They caught some of the firms in Hungary doing just that. Mixing Chinese product that's not even close to what it should be.<br />Am not saying that all of them are like that, but this brand gone from 5 star plus to 0 (ZERO).<br /><br />These tins are possibly filled by Chinese or some other country. If it says on the package: Distributed by: (whoever) then it's NOT MADE in the USA or neither was IMPORTED from Hungary.<br />If it was imported from Hungary it would say so on the package!<br /><br />I'd pass on this purchase if you know what real Hungarian Paprika is.<br />I know.<br />These are tasteless red powder.<br /><br />Suggestion: SAFEWAY supermarket had the best selection in the past but now it's the same as this seller's.

review/text: I was delighted to see Amazon carries this - I bought a tin a few years ago from a ethnic foods store that has since closed down; it was a large tin which lasted quite a while, but finally ran out.  All I've been able to find since is the "Sweet" Szeged version, which isn't bad but lacks the snap of the hot powder.  Much more flavorful than grocery store offerings; a little goes a long way. Not just red coloring!

review/summary: Great Tuna! But Packing some Heat!
review/text: I ordered a case of all three flavors Amazon offers. All were wonderful! It's about the same liquid to fish ratio as standard tuna, except instead of water you pour down the sink, you get very well seasoned sauces. The "Spicy Chili" flavor features a wonderful tasting sauce with chunks of chili, but be warned this stuff packs some heat. I have a fairly high tolerance for spicy foods and this was just right for me. 170-calories (give or take)per can. Throw in some mini carrote and a few crackers, and you have a very satisfying meal for very few calories. (.....)!

review/text: This is lower quality than what we get at Wal-Mart.  What flavor it has is akin to cat food.  The small, red, elongated peppers it contains have none of the distinctive flavor of chipotle, for the simple reason that they are serrano peppers.  G'Day Gourmet is incomparably better than this.

review/summary: Great Tuna
review/text: It is spicy, but if you like spicy food you will love this tuna. It is good quality tuna especially considering the price. There are better tunas out there, but they cost 3 to 4 times as much, however this tuna is a vast improvement over the major brands you see in grocery stores, which I can't stand to eat anymore they seem less like tuna and more like something scraped out of a tuna's colon. BTW, Chipotle isn't a species of pepper its a way of preparing any type of peppers. Really handy meal when you need something quick and simple, you don't need to add anything to it, often I eat it right out of the can.

I do like safcol's lemon pepper, which is very good.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon just refunded for 10 cans because I was dissatisfied. Way to go, Amazon!

Don't buy this product here, see if you can find it locally or at another Amazon seller or website entirely.

review/summary: Vino Italiano - A Quality Economy Wine Kit
review/text: This is my third Vino Italiano kit and I made a double batch of this Tuscany Rosso Magnifico to fill a 40 liter oak barrel I have ... I want to give this kit every opportunity to shine.  It's going to be my "house table wine" to enjoy with everyday meals while I wait for some of my upper end wine kits to fully mature.<br /><br />A couple of hints to better appreciate these Vino Italiano wine kits:<br /><br />1. Have realistic expectations.  These kits make a nice light to medium-bodied wine.  Beautifully red and brilliant in the glass, they are light and food friendy wines (and not necessarily great representations of their varietal).  But if you're expecting something full-bodied and inky dark like a Napa Cabernet, you're setting yourself up to be disappointed.  Keep in mind, this bottle of wine cost you $1.50 to make.  (The cost of bottles doesn't count ... you can reuse them over and over - stay green!)<br /><br />2. These wines will improve with time in the bottle.  While it's hard to resist dipping into your supply for weekly tastings, six months to a year in the bottle will make for a much nicer, less green-tasting wine.<br /><br />I'll add more to this review after I bottle this wine, but I will say that it is drinking better than the Valpolicella did at this early stage.  Less dry than the Valpolicella with a nice balance of both fruit and tannins.  I think I'll be proud to call this Rosso Magnifico my "house red."

I saw that a couple people were saying that some of these wines are a little weak.. What I do is make 5 gallon instead of 6. You get 25 bottles, I's still under $2.00 per bottle and the flavor is excellent.
