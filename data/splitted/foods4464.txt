review/summary: It's 3am and I'm wrinting this review and drinking this awesome coffee!
review/text: I'm a walmart coffee kinda guy.  Recently bought a fancy espresso maker and wanted to try a fancy coffee to taste the difference.  Tried this out, its' got excellent taste.  Don't know how to describe it, but in some way, it definitely tasts better.  Hopefully it's not my mind playing games on me cause I paid twice as much for it, but definitely give this a try if you drink coffee at least once a week.

review/summary: Consistently the best coffee around
review/text: There's no question - if you want a delightful espresso, get illy coffee. There's no comparsion. Its what many of the very good cafes use in Italy and its what you should use at home.<br /><br />Perfectly ground coffee. Excellent canister that seals effectively to maintain freshness. All around wonderful coffee experience.

review/text: Love illy coffee. The fine grain grounds, packaging, and taste are all quality. The delivery time was great *prime* and getting a two-for-one helps a ton. Tip: keep it in the freezer for longer lasting flavor. I was stuck in my condo for a solid week due to snow, Illy kept me going...

review/text: Great coffee. Makes excellent espresso. Lots of crema, nice aroma, well-balanced flavor.<br /><br />This stuff sells for $11 a can at my neighborhood (California) grocery store, so I think Amazon is over-charging a bit. If you can't find it elsewhere for less, though, at least Amazon has free shipping...

review/text: Illy medium roast is one the best ground coffees around. I brew it drip-style with a Melitta 102 filter cone and get a perfect brew every time. This is one of the rare coffees that can be brewed very strong and still taste smooth. I pay about 6 euro a can locally but is well worth it. Illy medium roast is a great coffee that I highly recommend.

review/text: Anyone who has spent any time in Italy will tell you this is authentic Italian espresso. Not only is it authentic, it is delicious. I was first turned on to Illy when I moved to North Beach, a little Italian neighborhood in San Francisco. I have not been able to find anything better. It is expensive, and my everyday espresso is Cafe Bustelo, but for true rich espresso with minimal bitterness, this is the bean for me.

review/summary: Ummm........over hyped???????
review/text: The title says it all  "over-hyped".<br /><br />Obviously, with the price of this coffee going at $14 bucks a can, you would expect "the best coffee I ever made/drank!"..........wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I've tried premium Starbucks, Lavazza, and a few select asian and german brands.....and all made from my awesome Italian moka pot.<br /><br />So what does this coffee compare to???  It tastes very similiar to Lavazza Expresso (black can).<br /><br />The body of the coffee does taste stronger and bolder than Lavazza......but not necessarily better.<br /><br />I hate to say this, but the taste of this Illy coffee tastes very close to Starbucks "Houseblend"...but minus the bitterness of Starbucks.<br /><br />The Lavazza Expresso tastes better.  It tastes nuttier, smoother, with more of a "mocha" taste.  Plus, the aroma from Lavazza itself is intoxicating alone......with the Illy brewing, well....let's just say "smells like regular coffee".<br /><br />Is this Illy coffee smooth - yes<br />Is it bitter - no<br />Does it taste good - yes<br /><br />BUT......Does it have character??? ------- ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!!!!!!<br /><br />The Lavazza Expresso (black can) has a distinctive taste (and smell) all to it's own.......the Illy does not.<br /><br />To sum it up, it's all over-hyped on Illy Expresso coffee.  For $14 a can, it's not worth it.<br /><br />Save your money and buy Lavazza Expresso for half the price and for more "character" and taste!!!!<br /><br />BTW.....I have no affiliation with Lavazza......just an avid coffee drinker.<br /><br />Happy Coffee Drinking!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: i was not impressed
review/text: all reviews which compared illy cofee to lavazza were much in favor of illy. I tried both coffee made in Bialetti Moka Express Stovetop Espresso Maker.<br />My opinion - they definetely have different taste but no difference in quality. Lavazza tastes stronger, while Illy tastes softer. Thus, I cannot justify such significant difference in price - $13 per 8oz. for Illy and $5 per 8oz. for Lavazza. I personally liked Lavazza taste better.<br /><br />Illy makes grind especially for Stovetop Moka Maker which I used. Apparently it is designed to be completely filtered out  - so there is no tiny bits of grounded coffee in the final product and no powder left in cup when it is empty. For some reason I do like these little pieces in the mouth (probably it is not good for teeth). Lavazza makes just one standard ground coffee which in finer than Illy's Moka version.

review/summary: Nothing crunches like pretzels
review/text: Pretzels are just about the best salty snack you can have.  They lack the fat of popcorn (except for the air popped corn which is not worth the effort).  They have a certain richness from baking, a taste which ties it right back to the beer from which it derived its malty goodness.<br />These pretzels are great in another way: you can only eat so much at any one sitting.  They take a certain effort to eat, unlike chips, so there's no danger you will eat the whole box.<br />My recommendation before eating is to part-open the bag and then break all the pretzels.  The reason is two fold: you get a variety of shapes and sizes, plus they are much easier to eat.  If you chomp into a whole pretzel, you will discover that you had dental problems that you never knew you had.  So, better not 'test' yourself and just give them a satisfying and productive bash in the bag before eating.  Enjoy...

review/text: I usually buy Snyders pretzels in different shapes and flavors.  This is one of my favorite.  I do break them up into pieces before I eat them since I know a few people that have broken teeth on them (due to their teeth, not the pretzels).  But I don't want to take any chances, so break them up first.  I love the taste of them and had been buying them one box at a time at the grocery store.  They are cheaper as a big box of the boxes, and I will order them again, if I don't have them on Subscribe and Save (can't remember).

review/summary: Pretzel's Choice -- My favorite Afternoon Snack
review/text: "You are indeed, a twisted pretzel of a man!" croaked my lovely, at least in my own eyes anyway, wife Dorothy D. Pretzel. After that it was love at first bite. Even though wifey strictly watches my diet for me, I like to sneak a snack of these delicious pretzels when she's not looking. I'm a rebel, what can I say? In fact, I've added these to my wishlist, along with a few other items you can pick up for if should you so desire. Now if you don't mind, Dorothy's calling for me, she needs pumiced again. Life is good.

review/summary: Hardly any salt on pretzels.
review/text: I like the pretzels, but there is hardly any salt on the pretzels. I've eaten several boxes with the same result. The salt is 90% in the bottom of the bag. I would rate the product a 5 if the salt was on the pretzels. I don't know if is a quality control problem or if some one is shaking the box a LOT. I hope they can fix the problem. I won't buy them again. Other products are better for the salt. The baked pretzels have a special quality to them, but they need the salt for me. Good Luck!

We sent him this for his birthday & he's in Nutella heaven...even hosted a Nutella party! It is delicious & the Nutella from Italy actually tastes better than the Nutella we can get here in the states...don't know why though. It is so GOOD, don't know why its not more popular in the US cause its everywhere in Italy.

review/summary: Dog rejected it. Threw up. Expensive.
review/text: My lab is getting older (9+) so we decided to "upgrade" her to a nicer (aka more expensive, fancier?) variety. We have had good luck with Nature's Variety so we stuck with it. We tried a much smaller bag of this food, which lasted about 2 weeks, and our dog seemed to love it.  Bought the larger bag, dog had first serving, then threw up.  Second serving; threw up. After that she refused to eat it. Perhaps a bad batch?<br /><br />I switched back to the previous variety (at less cost) and the dog is happy.<br /><br />I'd avoid this variety in the large, expensive bag until you've spent 4 weeks using it from smaller bags.  You don't want to get stuck with a $85+ bag of dog food that your dog rejects.

review/summary: Very good ... save money without sacrificing flavor!
review/text: I've always like Tully's coffee and this one is no exception.<br /><br />This was my first attempt of substituting ground coffee in my Keurig machine by using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers</a>. I previously bought K-cups on a regular basis, but due to constant price increases that luxury has ended for me.<br /><br />What I discovered:<br />- this twin pack lasted me 5 weeks (equal to 105 K-cups at 3 cups per day X 35 days)<br />- I paid $13.99 (K-cup boxes would have cost me $59.98 at $29.99 per box X 2)<br />- the flavor was fabulous, just like the K-cups<br />- you can control strength by choosing more or less coffee in the Ekobrew (I fill to the max)<br /><br />I'm very happy now! I can still use my Keurig, get a great cup of coffee, for 1/4th of the k-cup price.<br />Sure, it takes me a little longer to make coffee, then rinse out the Ekobrew, but this is still much quicker than using the old auto-drip type coffee maker.<br /><br />Price notes:<br />- NEVER ever pay more than $8.99 per 12oz bag!<br />- I paid $6.99 for "Starbucks Italian Roast" at Kroger (on sale)(my favorite coffee!)<br />- I paid $4.50 for "Caribou Mahogany" at Publix (buy one, get one free deal)<br />- Dunkin' Donuts coffee costs LESS at Dunkin' Donuts than Amazon<br /><br />In our struggling economy, there are ways to save money with only minor sacrifices.<br />I hope my review has helped,<br />Jeff

review/text: I love chocolate, and these Guylian chocolates are awesome, the hazelnuts are so finely ground and it's a heavenly flavor when combined with the soft marbled chocolate.  These chocolates are best consumed by nibbling away at them.  I've moved on to the Guylian Praline Twists, they're the same thing as the seashells but in individually wrapped form.  At my local store, the twists are less expensive than the boxed seashells, between 30-50% cheaper when looking at the price per ounce.  Since they're for me, I don't need the fancy gift packaging that the seashells have.  :)

review/summary: These are my favorite "in States" chocolate goodies.
review/text: I never was much of a chocolate person. I grew up preferring Strawberry, then Vanilla, and, lastly, chocolate.<br /><br />Then when I was 35, my husband took me with him on a business trip to Switzerland. What a treat that was! Lining the main boulevards were small confectionery shops filled with cocholates the likes of which I had never, ever laid eyes upon. A tiny box of chocolates that would be about 5 inches square and hold 12 pieces of candy cost around $30. But I had no idea that Chocolate could taste so exquistely good or look so beautiful. Little candies with 3 layers of chocolate in various flavors topped with small green candy looking twigs, or hearts, or diamond shapes.<br />Truffles made with plain chocolate or all different types of liquors. If I could have afforded it, I would have eaten myself into the size of a blimp. And the sales people were so delightful, always reminding me that this box was made Today and was meant to be eaten TODAY or it would get stale. I thought about our boxes of chocolate that sit on the shelves for weeks or months and winced. Thankfully, lots of walking was required to see the sights and I was able to eat what I could afford and still not gain! It was like Heaven.<br /><br />But then, back to the States we came. Hersheys just didn't cut it anymore. So I began taste testing what I could find locally always recalling the vendors' words "that chocolate was made today and is to be eatenn today." I tried Truffles, I tried mixed boxes whose photos made them LOOK LIKE the insides of the tiny little boxes in Switzerland. But nothing measured up.<br /><br />One day, I was in a local store and sighted these Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. It was my turn to bring treats to a group I go to on Thursdays. The chocolates were on sale and I had noted that the Belgian chocolates I had tried did seem fresher than the others, and tasted better than other brands shipped in Stateside. So I bought two boxes and trooped off to my meeting.<br /><br />As Soon as I had put the chocolate out, I checked to make sure that no one else had brought chocolate as a treat. Nope. Then I took one and ambled away to give them a taste. I wanted to make certain I hadn't bought something awful. So with my back turned to the group, I tried out a piece. I popped the whole thing in my mouth and went through my usualy routine for checking chocolate. I let the piece of candy just lay on my tongue for about 25 seconds until it had softened up and then began lightly and politely sucking on the chocolate. Oh my. It was fresh and had a delightful sweet chocolate taste very similar to the Swiss Chocolate I so loved. In fact, this was just a bit creamier. With little time to spare, I went ahead and bit into the piece expecting solid chocolate. But no, there was a soft inner core of ever sweeter, softer, creamier, fresher, chocolate in the center. I was Delightfully Surprised. Hating to hurry, I went ahead and chewed the piece up so that I could join the group.<br /><br />But my what an experience. I found myself going back to the counter several times during the afternoon, to get another piece of that chocolate I had brought. I urged the others to try it and each one was also very impressed with this chocolate. Where DID you get these? Were they terribly expensive? How long do they keep? Can I put them in my candy jar or will they melt? The SeaShells were an overwhelming success. I shared that I got them at the local pharmacy on the corner, that they were currently on sale, best to eat them as soon as possible, but they will keep in the freezer without problem for a year, and, yes you should be able to keep them in the candy jar as it was then winter here in Arizona, but I would not put them in a jar during the summer. I have found that even with air conditioning, delicate chocolate does not hold up well out of its box when it is hot. Somehow the candies sense the outside heat and their insides get really old and stale and melt. Ugh. Best to keep them in the fridge in the summer. If you buy them on sale as a gift, stick them in the freezer to preserve them like new.<br /><br />I am amazed at how good these are and I do pick them up on sale and pop them in the freezer for gifts, and keep them hidden in the fridge as a treat for myself. They are indeed, the best "other country, Stateside Product" I have found. Whatever theis company does is amazing because these tender candies stay fresh and edible for those of us here. So, I highly Recommend them as they are my favorites. I would NOT order them in the summer or when it starts to get warmish at all as they will probably melt in transit unless they are shipped in dry ice, which I do not know. But I only have them shipped in the dead of winter because it can get so warm here at any time.<br /><br />So, If you are a candy eater, and love foreighn chocolates, then get some of these. They are a wonderful treat. I hope you like them as well as I do.!

review/summary: T__H__E.......B E S T............B E C A U S E...
review/text: When these delightful GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA SHELLS, were on sale at my local department store, many years ago, my mom bought them -- because they were on sale.  But after TASTING these yummy morsels, we knew that these were the BEST chocolate ANYWHERE -- on sale, or not!<br /><br />A few years later, my sister came to visit.  We bought some more Gulian Belgian Chocolate Sea Shells. (don't remember if they were on sale then or not), in honour of her visit.  She took ONE bite of one....and summed up what my mom and I had thought ever since WE had first tasted them:<br /><br />  "...I can't believe how good they are!"<br /><br />.......................................................<br /><br />THE REAL REASONS WHY THESE CHOCOLATES ARE S_O GOOD Dept.<br /><br />Many years after her visit, I was watching The History Channel, and they mentioned Belgian chocolate, and showing how it was made.  I remember the voice-over saying that Belgian chocolate is even better than French chocolate -- and giving the reasons for this.<br />1) Belgian chocolates are made from the freshest of the most fresh ingredients.  2) Belgian chocolates are made by people who take IMMENSE PRIDE in their profession, and want to make sure everything is JUST right!<br /><br />.....................................................<br /><br />FALSE ECONOMY.....DON'T GET STUCK LIKE I DID!! Dept.<br /><br />I recently made the mistake of trying to find a "Belgian Chocolate Bargain" on Amazon.  Believe it or not, it was an 11-pound BLOCK of Dark Belgian chocolate.  WORST culinary mistake I ever bought, (I won't mention my home-made kitchen disasters here.) The greater the cocoa content, the harder the chocolate, you see.  I don't know if it was mentioned or not....but I probably would have bought this anyway, so delighted am I with BELGIAN chocolate.  I wound up with something SO huge, and SO hard, that I was lucky a friend of mine's husband was able to break it into twelve smaller blocks -- with his home-workshop SAW!  He didn't dare break it into slices, because this could have BROKEN his saw!  So I am left with 12 blocks of approximately 1 1/2" x 2" x 3", that I will probaby have to grate, then powder in my blender.  IF, that is, I don't get disgusted enough to throw the whole thing out.  Sadly, these hard BLOCKS of Belgian chocolate are no longer fresh....or that tasty, either..........<br /><br />...................................................<br /><br />THE ( YUMMY! ) BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />So, for a treat, DON'T look for a super-bargain....even in Belgian Chocolates.  Save money by fore-swearing pizza for a few months, or other such economies.  GUYLIAN BELGIAN CHOCOLATE SEA-SHELLS, (here in the 8.82 ounce "REGULAR economy" pack), offers bite-size morsels of true confectionary ART!  They are better than ANY chocolate you have ever tasted -- unless you have tasted Guylian Belgian Chocolate Sea-Shells before!  Give them to anyone you appreciate and admire....including yourself.  And you, (or whomever you give them to), will surely echo my sister's words:<br /><br />  ".....I can't believe how good they are!"

review/text: These are my absolute favorite chocolates!  Although I usually prefer dark chocolate, nothing beats the unique taste of Guylian.  These are actually more like a truffle, as each chocolate has a smooth, creamy hazelnut praline filling.  I guarantee that the taste is like no other chocolate that you have ever tried, yet you will be blown away by how absolutely melt-in-your-mouth delicious these are!  And the best part is that these are readily available and VERY affordable; I buy them for myself when I need a special treat.  Highly recommended!

review/summary: Buy from Walmart
review/text: First of all, I'd get these from Walmart, as they're hugely cheaper there - even paying shipping I think they were about half the price.<br /><br />In terms of the chocolate quality - I thought it was good.  Guylian shells are definitely not something you'll confuse with fresh Belgian pralines.  I'm assuming the freshness issue accounts for the difference in taste between these and something like Corne Toison D'Or in Brussels, or any one of the really good Belgian chocolate-makers whose products are flown here from Belgium and sold immediately or disposed of so that customers only get freshly-made chocolates.<br /><br />Providing one understands these are made economically to survive on the shelf, and are not to be compared to the amazing, delectable but quickly-spoiled types for which one either goes to Brussels or pays a fortune in shipping, I think these make a great, relatively inexpensive chocolate.

OK for grating to provide a nice color contrast, or just cut a wedge and leave it in a window for a quality display.  Also available are 16 month aged Beemster cheese which is not quite as sharp, nor as deep an orange color.

review/text: My girlfriend loves aged gouda and I'm a fan too. I bought this as part of her Valentine's Day present, but I think I eat just as much of it as she does. She thanks me profusely every time she breaks it out and has some (so long as she doesn't notice I've been nibbling). It is so rich and flavorful that if you like gouda at all, you owe it to yourself to try this at least once.<br /><br />P.S. The [...] service was excellent as well, truly a pleasure!

review/summary: Contains Chlorophyll for Hair & Skin
review/text: I'm sure this is great for cooking but I have purchased because it is great alone or mixed w/olive or coconut oils for my hair.  I am African American w/relaxed hair and the chlorophyll in the avocado oil stimulates healthy skin, scalp and hair.  Oil is not to heavy for 4a/b type hair. I would recommend looking up the benefits of avocado oil & chlorophyll for your hair & skin if that is of special interest.  This is the first brand of avocado oil I've found that has a concentrated level of chlorophyll as most oils are refined for cooking purposes.

review/summary: Not the taste of Hass
review/text: I want to return my recent purchase of Olivado Avocado oil. The oil is not at all like the seller/manufacturer had described it to be. Doesn't smell or tastes like Hass avocados. Hardly. Tastes more like cooked leafy greens. I am beginning to believe that buying avocado oil online is probably not the best way to go. This is the second brand of avocado oil (also tried San Pietro Chilean Organic avocado oil) I've purchased and both have been horrible. Maybe manufacturers of these oils should be more honest in describing the tastes of these oils so that the consumer would know what to expect. If they say it should taste mild and buttery than that's what one expects. Not citrus-like or herbaceous like described by others consumers. Also, I've read that avocado oil can go rancid despite the date on the bottle. That if it smells and tastes odd then probably it's rancid or on its way there. I've come across lots of oils in my lifetime and never the tought of it being rancid has ever entered my mind. Probably because I've never really come across any until now. Maybe avocado oil is a far to delicate of an oil that needs to be stored and handled in a special manner which too many sellers don't know how to. Anyway, I think I would give some other oil a try.<br /><br />Note: This is a follow up to my review. I wouldn't do business with this company ever again. Besides selling me a bad product, they make me responsible for shipping costs. So that means that instead of the $21.97 reimbursement,  I will only be credited $11.99 and they would not do so unless I ship them back the product which I had to pay $5.  to get it back to them. "Natural Zing you ripped me off". I am out $15.  and am very upset.<br />Sincerely,

review/summary: I adore it but I'm pretty sure it has some olive oil mixed in
review/text: First of all, this will change how you cook if you are anything like me.  I have no idea why I didn't hop on this avocado oil train long ago but I just discovered it at Whole Foods.  This takes salads and meals to a whole other taste level.<br /><br />I try to have a monounsaturated fat at every meal due to the health benefits and the scores of studies as well as personal experience showing they assist in weight loss when combined with a regular proper calorie diet. (These are the good fats) so I include lots of avocados and olive oil in my diet naturally....I'll make salads, pastas, hummus, tapanades for sandwiches, combine beans and corn with avocados etc, make a california veggie burger cooked in olive oil and topped with avocados, red peppers, etc in a pita...so replacing my olive oil with avocado oil has brought on wonderful new flavors.<br /><br />That said, with culinary training under my belt, I'm exceptional at picking out individual flavors in foods and I taste olive oil as a component here as well.  This is made by olivado which I'm assuming is likely an olive oil company by the name so it could simply be they are using the same presses to press out the avocados.  It isn't something that bothers me as I love olive oil, but it gives the avocado flavor a milder taste so I'm anxious to try some other brands as well.<br /><br />I personally feel this is an oil everyone should have on hand.  The flavor is a whole new depth when using oil that is unique and unexpected and I'll always have some, no matter what brand, in my own cabinet. I find myself reaching for this to replace other oils in recipes very often.

review/summary: Aromatic
review/text: I purchased these fresh curry leaves to make a South Indian Stew and it was a wonderful (and needed) addition. Once added to the tarka (tempering)along with a few other spices, these leaves immediately give off a strong yet aromatic citrus like aroma. Although most commonly used in curries, leaves from the curry tree can be used in many other dishes to add flavor. In Cambodia, Khmer toast the leaves in open flame or roasted it to a crunch and crushed it into a soured soup dish called Maju Krueng. These leaves are NOT related to curry powder and you should purchase these fresh not dried for the best flavor for your dishes. Although it is nit advised to store these in the refrigerator, I have found that if wrapped properly in several paper towels then placed in a ziploc bag, they do last for a few days and up to a week. Discard the leaves that are black.

review/summary: Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend, Better Than Most
review/text: I'm not a coffee snob, but I do appreciate a good cup of robust, freshly brewed, French roast coffee.  Occasionally I just don't have time to fire-up a  brewed cup, so I'm always on the lookout for a good instant at a fair price.  I'd heard positive things about Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend, so I decided to purchase the Amazon 4-pack and give it a try.  The box arrived in good shape with the bottles individually bubble-wrapped and protected. The bottle itself has a beautifully designed logo in appealing colors....Now for the taste test.  I did not hold the illusion that this coffee would rival drip, and it did not.  It was however, a good instant, more flavorful than most, and infinitely better than Folger's (one of the worst).  It reminded me of Taster's Choice, another good instant, but extremely over-priced.  Bottom line: This is a good instant at a fair price.  If you like instant coffee and don't expect "as good as fresh-brewed", you won't be disappointed.  Skip the Taster's Choice and give Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend a try.

review/summary: Smooth & Mellow
review/text: I have been looking for an instant coffee that I could make at work so as not to violate the office policy of not having coffee makers at the desk.  I tried some of the cheaper instant coffees at the grocery store and they were all terrible.  Some were very acidic, others I could not bear the taste.  This coffee is not bitter at all (as stated in one of the negative reviews) and is quite smooth and low in acid for those of us who are sensitive to acidic foods.  I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not taste like brewed coffee but has a smooth nutty coffee taste.  Once I realized this was not going to taste like brewed coffee, it became quite enjoyable and I do look forward to drinking it as part of my morning routine.

review/summary: buying neocate infant formula
review/text: Amazon price was comparable to wholesale direct from the manufacturer and is reliable and speedy in shipping.  Price is high and 1 can lasts only 4 days.  Manufactured in England.  Comparable American made product called Elecare, just as good, slightly better price, but if you go to the Neocate manufacterer website and call their customer service you can request your first sample can free.  Good product for infants with milk protien allergies.  We were concerned about strange colored soiled diaper and pediatrician tested it and came up positive for blood in stool.  Doc started us on elemental formulas first.  Two are widely available.  Similac Alimentum and Enfamil Nutramigen.  Enfamil adds DHA to their formula in an attempt to make it more comparable to breast milk but our infant couldn't digest it and passed it as a thick yellow paste.  If you sign up at Similac website they will mail you samples of their other formulas but also several coupons for $5 off any of their formulas which really helped offset the cost.  Be prepared though.  All of these smell horrid and taste nasty as a powder, not as bad once mixed with water.  Fortunately infant tastebuds are not as developed. Baby still had a lot of reflux and gas even when we tried adding every colic remedy/gripe water on the market, which also drove up our feeding costs.  Pediatrician warned these rememdies are good for occassinal not chronic use.  So we stepped up to the Neocate.  After making my first purchase on Amazon, I got bolder and started poking around ebay.  Occasionally finding a better price but be sure to check shipping charges.  Some people make it look like they are selling it cheaper and jack up their shipping charges .  And there is all the drama, bidding wars and you can get sucked in just like in gambling so set your price point and stick to it.  A newer better offer is born daily. Sellers are not as reliable as Amazon and don't always package product well enough to prevent cans from denting.  And keep in mind, most infants will only need this product for the first 9 months to one year and then you can switch to soy or less expensive alternatives.  Good luck and good nights.

If you cook and use apple cider vinegar, you at least owe to yourself to use the good stuff, especially since this one's not that much more price-wise.

review/summary: Farro
review/text: Farro is a wonderful nutty grain that is a great alternative to rice for people with Diabetes.  You can eat it for breakfast cold by adding some fruit and some yogurt, or you can have it for dinner as an alternative to rice.

review/summary: One of the best care package items EVER.
review/text: I was deployed to Iraq last year with the US Marine Corps. My wife sent me some of these which I put into the mini fridge that my hut had. After a 12 hour combat resupply mission, coming back to the hut and having one of these made me feel almost human again. I actually started saving them for the hottest/longest days. The taste is a little different, if you are used to gatorade or coke, but it is nice. Drink it cold.

review/summary: Really peachy
review/text: I've tired almost all of the vita cocos besides the tangerine and grape fruit and I can say this is the really not that bad. The peach flavor kinda balances it out with the coconut water. The nutrition is equal to the pineapple but not the acai(acai is still better). here is the nutrition for the peach<br /><br />Sodium 40mg = 2%<br />Potassium 660mg = 19%<br />Total Carb 20g<br />Protein 0g<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Dietary fiber 0g<br />Sugars 20g<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Calcium 5%<br />Phosphorous 5%<br />Vitamin C 230%<br />Iron 0%<br />Magnesium 10%<br />Natural Coconut Water,<br />Mango Puree, Peach Puree,<br />Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)<br /><br />Over all this is one of my favorite flavors. Still got two other flavors to try.

review/summary: Mango Slushee
review/text: Wow you either love or hate this product...I love it...but I had to play with it to find the right way to drink it, you may wonder what that means. Well I love peach & mango drinks & love coconut water anyway....but this product has to be VERY VERY cold to be at its best or it taste like a pasty product. I find that if you let it get just a bit frozen like a soft slurpee/slushee it is really good or just very very cold will work. I have seen some ppl post very negative remarks on here & think some may be exaggerating just a bit & some may not really know what to expect from a drink like this...nothing wrong with that just dont be so dramatic about it really. One thing I have found a GREAT use for this with is Jamba Juice now sells frozen packs of it tops selling smoothies in stores now, so I like to buy my favorite Mango a go go & use the mango/peach coconut juice to blend the smoothie instead of using the apple juice that it calls for...you could use any of the vita water favors to mix with any of the flavors. Instead of hating something try mixing it with something else & finding ways to create a healthy drink. Bottom line I love it.

review/summary: More like fruit juice than water
review/text: To me, this is good but nowhere near as good as the pineapple flavor.  I think the mango just does not compliment the peach, BUT, it's still good and appears to be healthy and has a reasonable amount of calories.  It was between a 3 and 4 for me so I rounded up to 4.<br /><br />It's light and refreshing, like water with mango, peach, and coconut flavor added. It doesn't taste phony either. It is 100% natural and it tastes natural. Too good to be just flavored water. It tastes more like a light fruit juice.  I had mine chilled. It is imported from Brazil. A plastic twist-off cap allows you to stick in a straw easily, without hammering the package to punch it through. A single package is about 6 inches high, with 3 inch diagonal square shape.<br /><br />One paper coated package contains 17 fluid ounces, marked as 2 servings. Per serving stats are 60 calories (so 120 calories total per package), 0 fat, 0 cholesterol, 30mg sodium, 500 mg potassium, 15g sugar, 4 % calcium, 4 % phosphorus, 175 % vitamin C, 8 % magnesium. Ingredients, as listed in order on package are: natural coconut water, mango puree, peach puree, ascorbic acid (vitamin C). The package states it is 100 % natural, has more electrolytes than leading sports drinks with 15 times the potassium, and has more potassium than 2 bananas.<br /><br />So--- it is good, refreshing, healthy, easily packable, and easily openable. (It's ok. I can make up words. I work for the government.) I really like the high potassium content, too. (Note--I am NOT a doctor.) As the sweltering East Coast heat and humidity approaches, potassium helps with the fluid you lose. Whether you are on fluid pills, or working outside in the eat, or running and jogging for your health, or hiking, or your children are playing and running in the heat, it's a real good idea to keep those potassium levels up. Low potassium levels, as I understand it, can be harmful, leading to cramps in your legs or worse--maybe even making you pass out. Anyway, this is good and it sure tastes a lot better to me than Gatoraid (yuk). So, check it out, and read up on "potassium" before the heat gets here.

review/summary: Best Coconut Water Ever
review/text: I have tried just about every coconut water on the market, but VitaCoco is hands-down THE BEST.  It does not have any added sugar \ cane juice (like O.N.E.), flavor (natural or otherwise like ZICO) or preservatives.  They use real fruit puree to add flavor and sweetness.  It's a great way to hydrate and get your daily dose of Vitamin C.  The taste is delicious.

review/summary: Tastes a bit like V8
review/text: I purchased this item through Amazon's subscription option.  My 11 year-old daughter was running cross-country for her school, and I didn't want her drinking sugary sports drinks to assist in replenishing fluids lost during her runs.  She loved it.  She said it tastes like V8, and it does!

review/summary: Great Stuff
review/text: I've tried other coconut waters and Vita Coco is the best. There flavors taste fantastic and it is a healthier alternative to sugary sports drinks. I was working 12 hour days in a hot building all summer and no issues with cramping when I drank one of these a day. The peach and mango is my favorite.
