review/summary: Zuke's mini treats
review/text: These are an excellent treat for training as they are nice and small. My chihuahuas will turn their noses up at most dog biscuits but love these. They are a softer treat so wouldn't give any crunch factor. I have been buying these for a long time but the price is much better here on Amazon than at my pet store.

review/summary: Our dog loves these!
review/text: These little treats are excellent for training.  We have a small 7lb Shorkie (Shih Tzu/Yorkie mix) and he loves these things.  I have been able to teach him tricks and have him obey commands by using these treats.  They are one of the better treats out there for dogs as they do not contain corn.  The treats are very easy to break in half also for smaller servings.  They have other flavors as well, Salmon & Peanut butter but our dog seems to love the chicken ones.  We also put these in a food cube and make our dog work for them as well.  I definitely would recommend these.

review/text: I purchased the Zuke's mini salmon treats from other pet stores before. They come in 6 oz. bag for almost $6.  I can't believe when I found the 1 lb. bag for $9 on Amazon and I ordered it as my Shih Tzu loves these salmon treats.  We used them to train her.  It uses all natural ingredients which is very important to us.  However, it can be kind of smelly since it is made of fish(salmon).

review/text: Bought these treats to use when training my dog and they have worked perfectly.  The treats are small, low-calorie and can be broken into even smaller pieces.  They have a very strong odor, when makes them impossible for my dog to resist and an excellent reward for obedience training.  I highly recommend these treats.  **You should note that these treats will dry out quickly if you carry them in your pocket or leave them lying out.  They need to be keep in a container or baggie when you carry them so they will stay moist.

review/summary: Don't hold Dog's attention, Gas
review/text: I bought the chicken flavored treats for my dog. She'd eat them if I handed them to her, but they definitely weren't good enough for her to come running to me on a recall. That makes them kind of useless as training treats, which they're perfectly sized for.<br /><br />She also got serious gas from these treats.. which suggests they're probably lower quality food. Maybe your dog will like them, but if he/she's picky, don't bother.<br /><br />I just buy franks at the store and cut them up small. It's cheaper by far, and I can eat them as well. I usually microwave them long enough on high so they dry up, then they make perfect treats that don't make your hands sticky, but my dog likes them fresh a little better. Just a heads up.

review/summary: not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys
review/text: as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over.  Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.<br /><br />i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with "caviar tastes" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs).

review/text: I have a 10 month old Boston Terrier and I use these treats when we go to puppy class and when we do exercises at home. He absolutely loves them and they are the perfect size for training. And since they are only 2 calories each, I don't feel too bad about giving him a handful. My only complaints are that they are kind of stinky (probably because of the fish oil) but it's nothing unbearable, and that because they are moist treats, they can dry out easily if you forget to seal the bag completely. Other than that, we both love these treats and I would recommend them to anyone.

review/text: My two ECS eat salmon dog food and it's hard to find a salmon treat and one that is affordable when you do find them.  These are PERFECT for agility, obedience, conformation-- you name it.  They do smell strong of Salmon (which, my boys love) and like the other reviewer, they will dry out pretty quickly if not kept sealed.  That being said, my boys will not hesitate to eat them if they do get dried out from leaving them in the bait bag.  At the 4-for-3 promotion price, you can't go wrong!

review/summary: My sheltie love these treats (and so does my sister's cat)
review/text: My 30 lb shetland sheepdog is picky.  She's fed a high-quality food, and she only gets the best treats.  No "doggie junk food" to be had in our household, no corn, no by-products, no treats pressed and colored to look like mini T-bone steaks (unfortunately, I don't eat as well as she does.... Doritos can pass as a meal for me).  She's been known to spit out treats that didn't meet her standards.<br /><br />Not so with these Zuke's Mini Naturals.  These really get her attention, and they were vital in training her to go potty as soon as I let her out into the backyard, to let me brush her teeth, and to walk nicely on a leash (nothing on our walks is more interesting than Mama or Daddy in possession of Zuke's Minis).  My little sheltie comes running at the crinkle of the bag.<br /><br />She loves all three flavors: Peanut Butter, Salmon, & Chicken.  It's amazing to find a product like this, where the flavor of the treat, salmon, comes from salmon being the first ingredient on the ingredient list.  The texture is soft, not crunchy, and they don't fall apart in your pocket, nor are they greasy or stinky.<br /><br />Also, we've found that my sister's cat goes nuts for these Zuke's in the salmon flavor.  They're not intended for cats, but my sister's cat apparently didn't read the package when she found and inhaled these.<br /><br />These Zuke's Mini Natural treats are the best, I'll continue to buy them again and again.

review/summary: Why dogs won't eat them.
review/text: My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over.

review/summary: Great Size for Small Dogs!!! AND MINE LOVES IT!
review/text: The problem with treats for me was finding one I didn't have to keep breaking into little pieces when I was training.  Not only that, it seems my little Morkie really enjoys these.  She's only 6lbs so the size and the taste of these treats make training go much faster.  I'm starting to run out and I got these October 3,2010 so I'm about to buy some more again!

review/summary: Salmon and Peanut Butter
review/text: My dog LOVES these, especially the peanut butter ones.  He goes insane when i open the bag, and they are perfect for training. Id recommend cutting them in half for puppies, smaller dogs. they are already small, but it makes them easier to swallow and continue with rapid training. Dont listen to people about how bad they smell, sure they don;t smell like roses, but the smell is more than tolerable. The people say it is unbearable must have the most sensitive olfactory in the world. Just rinse your hands with water after, and the smell is gone. I prefer the smell of the peanut butter ones, and my dog loves them. gets reaaly excited, which is what i need when training him

review/summary: My dog loves these Zukes!
review/text: I got these treats because we needed chewy treats that our soft-coated wheaten terrier puppy could eat quickly during training. We had a lot of the cookie type treats earlier but it took too long for him to break apart the dry treats and lick up the crumbs. He'd also run around having only half-swallowed the treat and I worried about him choking. These treats were recommended to me by a friend and they have solved these problems.<br /><br />PROS<br />-- Our dog loves these treats. LOVES them. Mostly because they are so moist and chewy.<br />-- Even though they are chewy, the treats don't leave any residue on your hands or anything-- they are very clean.<br />-- quick and easy to chew. Seems to be a lot less unhealthy than many other treats out there.<br />-- definitely gets him to pay attention!<br /><br />CONS<br />-- you have to be careful of leaving the bag open as the treats can dry out, although I think you can put a damp napkin in and re-hydrate the treats.<br />-- These are a little too expensive for regular use, especially if you have a bigger dog.<br /><br />Our dog is medium sized and it is easy to go through these treats pretty quickly. Then again, you really need treats that a dog will go wild for, and these do the trick. Overall, these are great treats that we'd recommend to anyone that is looking for high quality dog treats. When he finishes his training for the day we toss a small handful of these around he floor and let him hunt them all down (he is a terrier so he loves it!).

review/summary: Love the idea, can't stand the smell!
review/text: My dog and I both love Zuke's.  The mini naturals are great for training because they are small but super flavorful.  This means that you don't have to cut them up or break them into little pieces (I'm looking at you, Buddy Biscuits), but your dog will still go the distance to earn them.  The small size makes them super convenient.  I have used the peanut butter, chicken, and salmon flavors.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the salmon flavor has an awful stench.  I am used to reeking like dog treats, but the salmon odor is too much.  Upon opening the bag for the first time, I gagged.  Even now, several months after purchasing the 1lb bag, I am still trying to get rid of these treats.  I tried passing them off on my mother, but she wouldn't take them because of the smell.  Yesterday I decided I would just bite the bullet and use them for training for a few days, but after just a couple minutes in the bag I use for treats, I gave up.  I just couldn't take it.  I stuck them back in the bag they came in.  I think I will mix the remaining treats with a giant glob of peanut butter to try to get rid of them in one stinky fell swoop.<br /><br />So Zuke's: we love you.  You have a great mission that both my dog and I both appreciate in our own ways.  The salmon mini naturals, however, definitely miss the mark.  We'll stick to the chicken and peanut butter flavors.

review/summary: Great treat!
review/text: This is a great treat to put inside the Premier Busy Buddy Tug-a-Jug Treat Dispensing Dog Toy.  My 60 pound 6 year old "puppy" goes nuts whenever she gets this treat/toy combo.  It is one of her favorite treats, it has a (moist treat) smell to it (which I think is tolerable and is what makes the dogs smell it from a mile away).  This bag barley lasts a month and I don't even give it to her every day.  One you open the seal, your dog will keep asking for more. Bag is resealable to help treats fresh.  Great for training too!

review/text: These treats are nice and small (about 1cm diameter, 1cm tall), making them excellent for training, and they're still popular after 6 bags! In addition, although the pricing is a little odd, they're much cheaper than at the local Petco. As others have stated they can dry out a little, but that hasn't been a problem for me.

review/summary: Wonderful Treats for training
review/text: Just have to say that the treats are great for training. They are small enough that they don't fill up your small - medium sized dog and allow for enough time to work on a couple of tricks or actions each day. I choose peanut butter just because I know my dog loves it and we don't have to get really messy with something like a kong or anything. The overall training has been going really well with these as I can take a handful and have more than enough left for each training session. I will say that the one thing is that they are small enough that you sometimes worry that the dog is going to bite your hand and not the treat so make sure to palm feed your dog and not try to pinch the food between two fingers.

review/summary: Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth
review/text: My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks.  I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay.  After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled.  I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training.

review/summary: Perfet bite sized treats!
review/text: These treats are wonderful. They are healthy and you can tell they are full of EFA's. They do smell to high heaven of fish, so if you can't stand that smell, you won't like these. My dog won't eat fish, but she LOVES these. My dog does not drool, except when you open these up! These are her favorite treats, and she is a 45lb medium mutt. They are perfect for training rewards. She hates having her nails clipped, so when we clip her nails, I have my fiance pinch one of these in his fingers and she tries to get it from him and she's totally distracted from me clipping her nails. The price is right especially if you have prime!

review/text: I tried Zukes Minis after they were suggested by a vet tech as a great treat for training my new puppy.  They are soft and easy to cut into even smaller pieces so you can use a lot of them during training sessions.  The price through Amazon beats the pet and feed store prices by a long way, so I bought 3 large bags of different flavors.  The bags zip shut, so the treats stay fresh.  I just take out a handful and cut them in quarters, and keep them in another ZipLoc bag, enough for a few training sessions.  I cut them using both a pill cutter and a knife; I think using a knife is easier.  In their whole uncut size, they are only 4 calories each, so they are not a fattening treat either.  A great product I feel good about using.

review/text: I bought these treats for the size. We go through a lot of treats on walks with our dog, who has some leash issues. I get frustrated with crumbs in my pockets and breaking up treats during walks. He is a picky fellow when it comes to treats. These are, in fact, a great size, but they dry out quickly as others have commented. I can live with that, but I think they may also lose flavor. My dog has become less and less interested in them, and it's to the point now where he seems to eat them as a favor to me. For the price, I can find more appealing treats elsewhere and live with permanent crumbs in my pocket.

And for those of you label-readers, these things are made with all-natural ingredients that are great for your dog.

I highly recommend these if your dog is a "dainty" eater (I've never had one before) and even if they will swallow a hot dog whole (like my last dog, a Lab) these Mini naturals will be loved.<br />Bob

review/summary: Perfect training treat!!
review/text: This treat amazing for training!<br /><br />I'm writing this in regards to my 5 month old puppy, somewhat food motivated, and my 12 year old lab mix, extremely food motivated.  I can't say how the treats would do for a very fussy dog.<br /><br />It never crumbles in your pocket but splits easily for giving small training rewards.  It's tiny enough to use a bunch without filling up your dog.  It has good ingredients.  It doesn't mess with the puppy's digestion.<br /><br />The only possible drawback is that it's smelly.  Not gross, just smells like fish.  They love the treats and I'm sure the odor has something to do with it, but they also can smell it on you, so you can't surprise them with a treat.<br /><br />Overall, the go-to treat for training, rewarding, and stuffing in toys to prevent separation anxiety.

review/summary: Perfect size but smells less than perfect
review/text: My 5 month old Lab mix enjoys these treats (but he seems to enjoy any food) and I love the small size since we're still training him.  The smell isn't so great so you can't just stash a handful in your pocket unless you want your pocket to smell like them.  I knocked off 1 star in my rating just because of the smell, but if you keep the bag sealed at all times, you won't smell anything and it will keep the treats fresh.  I found the same item at my local pet store in NYC (Tribeca area) for $1 less than Amazon so I was a bit shocked that it's cheaper there than Amazon.

review/summary: Excellent Training Tidbits
review/text: I purchased these based on other great reviews, and I'm glad I did! Our newly adopted 40 lb, 9 month old Amstaff/Lab mix is very food motivated and I feel great using these for training without worrying about their health factor. Plus they are absolutely tiny (pencil eraser size). I am surprised other people cut them up, when they are so small already! I also prep and freeze a Kong for her overnight to have while we're at work, and these are the perfect size to plug up the smaller hole in a Large sized kong!<br />We have only tried the chicken flavor so far, and she loves them! They do dry out if left out, but that doesn't seem to decrease their delicious-ness factor with her. Finally, Amazon does have the best price around on them, so if you're looking for healthy, dog approved treats, go for Zuke's minis!

review/text: I have a 7 week old APBT/Golden Retriever mix who is very tiny and not so good with crunchy treats. Even small crunchies are too big and I have to break them in half an it gets pretty messy! They're also a bit too hard for her baby teeth.<br />Zuke's mini naturals are awesome because they are so small, and they are soft enough without being mushy or greasy. The ingredients are great and my puppy (and other dogs I've given them to) loves them! I bought the salmon and peanut butter ones, so far we've only tried salmon, but she goes crazy for them! Highly recommended!

review/text: We picked up a 6oz bag at petco at first (for like $7), but since our puppy loved them we committed to a bigger bag, and this was the best price around (amazon prime wins every time).<br /><br />Highly recommended for training, but remember that hotdogs are better than pretty much anything (though gross...).  These treats will dry out if left unsealed for a pretty long period of time (many days, a week?), so don't take out too many at once, but even dried she still loves them.<br /><br />If you're on the fence, definitely get them :)

review/text: He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind.

review/summary: A Great Training Treat
review/text: My dog has agility training two days a week, so we are always trying new treats for her to assit in motivating.  We use the Zukes on a semi regular basis.  I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last.  The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.<br /><br />The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats.  She does like the Zukes but  she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store.

review/text: The ingredients in these treats are healthy and natural and Horton, my Tibetan Terrier loves them.  So far we've only tried the chicken flavor.<br /><br />I like them for training because they are small and soft and have only a few calories so you don't have to worry about giving lots of them while teaching your dog to behave.  (I'm a puppy spoiler, so I could easily end up with a plump pup, if I'm not careful).  I couldn't find any other treats that even had the calories listed.<br /><br />The only downside to these treats is that they smell really bad. (to me, that is.)

review/text: My dog does agility so we give her Zuke's when we train. The treat is pretty smelly which is why we use them (a smelly treat will keep her attention).  She will pefrorm for Zuke's they dont seem to be her favorite treat (she performs best for bellyrybs a freezed dried liver which is too big to give as a regular treat)however in training she may eat 10 -15 treats so perhaps she gets tired of them.  The reason for the 4 stars is the treat is semi moist they do tend to dry out if left exposed for too long or if you improperly seal the bag.  Also my rating is based on my dogs preference for several other types of treats (on treats she will love she will knock our other dog down to get the treat).

My dog loves it, and I give it to her as a reward for staying while being groomed, or pooping and peeing outside. She always wants more. Of course I only give her 2 at a time. These would last forever since there are so many in a bag. Amazon has these for like $3 something, great for getting up to $25 free shipping thresh hold too. My dog loves these and they do not irratate her stomach in any way as the ingredients are natural, meaty, no filler and healthy for her. The treats themselvesa re moist and smells like meat. Dogs do love moist treats more than dry treats, so the yare great for training. Highly recommend it.
