review/text: I realize this is healthy food for a baby, but the smell alone is bad enough to make any adult sick to their stomach.  After half a spoonful, my daughter started making these gagging noises and proceeded to projectile vomit three times.  I would not recommend this.  We ended up throwing out the remaining jars.  This is the only Gerber food we have ever had this type of problem with.

review/summary: Totally Tasty and Relaxing, But Not a Snoozer!
review/text: I have been trying herbal tea mixtures in tea bags for years. Whenever I go into any ethnic market I always look for them. Overall this is the very best for taste and almost more importantly for reliability and predictability. Unlike green tea which will stay good in the little bags seemingly for years, a lot of herbal teas turn sour or dusty in no time. So if the merchant has had them on the shelf for a while what you are actually buying is flavorless dust. This mixture is always very fresh tasting and super delicious. I add it to green tea all the time. Recently when my brother-in-law visited us he tasted my green tea with this mixture and raved saying: "This is like a meal!" It is so rich and upfront with this mixture that it is really complex and so tasty. The herbs relax you a bit, which if mixed with green tea and its caffeine is sort of robbing Peter to pay Paul in terms of energy. I drink it in the morning all the time, and it has never made me sleepy. I recommend it on the basis of taste, I sort of doubt it would work to induce sleep. It has a generally balancing effect, and its absolutely gourmet mouth feel and taste makes it seem very refined, which is great combined with a lot of the cheaper green teas I buy.

review/text: These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck.

review/text: I subscribed to this litter because I thought that it would be great, and it claims it does the same thing as the litter we were using before. I couldn't find our current litter on subscription, but I figured it would be okay to go ahead and make the switch.  No big deal, its Arm & Hammer, it will be good, it does the same thing.  WRONG!  We clean the litter box every day, once at 9am, and again at 9pm, so the odors coming from that thing are inexcusable.  Within a matter of days I've had to completely air out upstairs in the middle of winter because I cannot take the smell.  With our other litter, it always smelled like fresh scented detergent or something pleasant, even while we cleaned it.  With this litter its as if there isn't even any litter in the box.<br /><br />We will be switching back to Fresh Step Premium Scoopable Scented Clumping Cat Litter Multiple Cat Strength time NOW!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006H6F1LE">We Want It All</a>

review/summary: Mixed Feelings
review/text: I have mixed feelings about this cat litter.<br /><br />When my cat first poops, the litter mixes with the smell of the feces and creates a horrid porta-potty smell. However, after about 5 minutes, the odor is COMPLETELY gone. It clumps poop very well, but if you have multiple cats, this litter does what all litter does- makes the "wet sand" consistency at the bottom of the pan (and it smells like ammonia when you scrape it out.)<br />Get A&H Super Scoop if you are sensitive to perfume (it works the same as Double Duty, just a bit less feces odor control.) Get double duty if you would rather smell chemicals for 5 minutes than poop all day.<br /><br />This litter also has the tendency to stick to paws. If you get it, keep the box on a non-carpet surface so you can easily sweep the granules that your cat may track out.<br /><br />Overall, good product, just be prepared for a nasty smell for 5 minutes when your cat takes a dump.

review/text: I was excited to try this cat litter hoping to eliminate the feces odor other litters have failed to do.  The litter does help with the odor but my gosh, the dust is horrible.  I clean the box twice a day and each time the dust envelopes my head and I start coughing.  I'd rather smell the poopy than breath whatever is in this product.....bad, bad, bad.  The cat box is covered so the poor cat must also be suffering.  I'm going to try a corn based product next.  I've been told some people use horse bedding or chicken crumbles which make fine cat litter and are very inexpensive.

review/text: I originally gave this item one star because the box was busted open and I only received about half of the box worth of product. I tried the return link but it indicated that the product was non-returnable and that I should use the "help" link instead. I went to the help section and reported that the shipment was damaged and in my opinion should be replaced. After I submitted that, I received confirmation that the message was sent and that I would receive a reply within 12 hours. A couple of hours later I went to check on the shipment status of another item and noticed that a replacement box of cat litter was being shipped. I checked the invoice for it and it showed a total cost of $0. Once again, Amazon made things right.

review/text: It is hard for me to assign stars to the cat litter.  I like the product and so do my cats. From that standpoint it is 5 stars.  But the litter was exactly twice as expensive as Target (but they will not ship it) and Petco (who will) which brings me to my final problem - having a 40# box of KL in a larger cardboard box is scarey.  I must say that there was no leakage in the Amazon box or the 2 Petco boxes.  I will probably go back to buying KL from Target and schelp it up the stairs.

It takes about 5 minutes to cook in the microwave and you have to make sure to use a good size bowl or it will boil over and make a huge mess.  As for the taste, only one of my kids likes it.  For the rest of us, it's just a very strange flavor for oatmeal.

review/summary: Good quality, affordable food.
review/text: It's really important to me to feed my pets quality food.  My first dog had severe allergies to food, and all of the vets we took her to caught that.  She had terrible skin rashes, raw hot spots, and constant ear infections--all of which are indications that she had food allergies.  I wish I had had the Internet back then so I could have saved her life.  She eventually ended up getting stomach cancer and dying at the very young age of five.  I truly believe that if we had switched her to a quality food, she could have lived a longer, happier life. It was an important lesson for me to learn, and I will never feed any of my animals sub-par food ever again.<br /><br />I have had my current dog on Natural Balance Ultra Premium as well as Solid Gold Hund n Flocken.  Both of those foods are of good quality, but are also very pricey.  If you would like to do your own research on different food options and brands, [...]and [...]are great sites.<br /><br />Natural Balance, Solid Gold, and Premium Edge have all received 4-star ratings at dog food analysis.  The biggest issue with Premium Edge (and all of Diamond foods--including NB and SG) was the fact that there weren't any written guarantees that they did not use Ethoxyuin as a preservative.  I emailed Diamond foods, and received an email stating that they and their suppliers no longer use Ethoxyquin as a preservative.<br /><br />I'm really impressed with Premium Edge.  It is a good quality food and it comes at a much better price for me (on top of being significantly cheaper, the bags are 35lbs as opposed to NB and SG's 33lb. bags).  The final selling point for me is that my dog really LOVES her food now.  With both previous brands, she would eat half of her food and then walk away and eat the rest of it later when she got hungry enough.  With Premium Edge Skin and Coat, she scarfs everything down right away.  She even BEGS me to feed her in the morning and evening now.<br /><br />All in all, I'm really happy with my choice to switch to Premium Edge.  It's an affordable, good quality dog food, and my dog LOVES it!  I highly recommend giving it a try.  :)

His skin and coat were back to normal once he had been on this dog food for two weeks. I've been feeding it to all my dogs ever since. I have four dogs now and so the price  on Amazon is really appreciated...Along with the quick delivery. As an aside: My dogs love the taste so much that I have used the kibble as their behavioral treat as well (e.g., sit, stay, etc.) Can't get a better taste review than that!

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: We did a LOT of research before settling on this brand. It is some of the best and highest quality dog food for the price. My wife was concerned that it would not be good for our small dogs (2 pugs), but the pieces are plenty small for them and they both chow down on it.

review/summary: Made my dog's coat shine
review/text: I have been impressed with this dog food, that I started using when I saw it at a local feed store.  It was cheaper than the other foods with similar premium ingredients, so that was a plus.  My senior dog's coat had gone from black to a brownish color on Avoderm, indicating that something was off.  Since I've been feeding Premium Edge, her coat has gone back to a very shiny black.  I have to conclude that this food has had something to do with that.  I checked it out on a dog food review site, and they give it 4 stars, which is pretty good, on their 6-star system.  (Their 6-star foods are very expensive and I can't afford them.  I also don't think my house pets need them) Their major qualm was that there was no statement about whether the fish in the food contained ethoxyquin, which is apparently a bad thing.  I wrote the company and received a response saying their food was ethoxyquin-free, even though there was no statement to that effect on the sack.  Good enough for me.  Too bad Amazon appears not to plan to carry this brand any longer.

review/summary: Best dog food I've found
review/text: I rescued a Pitbull from deplorable conditions when she was 5 months old and she was a mess!  She had allergies and mange and her immume system was very compromised.  I put her on this food and it cleared her skin up in less than a month!  I've researched a lot of food online and at the Pet stores and this I believe is the best!  It is a tad pricey but if you love your dog like I do then it's worth it.  I hope Amazon will continue to carry this for a very long time.

review/summary: Premium Edge Dry food for adult dogs, skin & coat Salmon
review/text: Decided to purchase the 35 pound bag for my 12 year old dog who have skin allergy base on the positive reviews I've read on line.  Very happy with shipping & Packaging service from Amazon.  But very dissapointed in Premium Edge.  Not only did the food not help him, it seemed to made him worst the first couple of days! Also, the product says for adult dogs but on the package it also says from age 1 to 10 years of age???? My dog is 12.  I don't understand all the positive feed back for this product?  and I so regret for buying such a large bag or the product for that matter.

review/summary: Great value product that is full of protein
review/text: We recently started eating more healthy in our household. We switched to pasture raised chickens and eggs with no antibiotics, no corn feed, no hormones. We also switched to pasture raised beef and hogs. Once again, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no corn feed. What a difference in ease of weight control. Not to mention a lot healthier all the way around. So, it did not take us long to decide to provide a better dog food for our two blue ticked beagles. Since we can not insure that the beef or chickens used in dog food are of the same quality as what we eat, salmon and potatoes are a better choice. Our female has lost 5 pounds from a hefty 40 lbs to 35lbs and has leveled out beautifully. The male has lost 8 pounds and has also leveled out to the vets praise. She was impressed with their progress at 9 years old. My geriatric children love the taste and no longer hesitate around the food bowl. The internet is a wonderful thing and I am so glad we found Premium Edge. It is a high quality dry dog food that is reasonably priced. You can pay more, but you return on investment will be marginal. We have started topping it off with Dogswell canned dog food just to add an extra bit of flavor and our dogs have never been happier.

review/summary: Very good food.
review/text: I've spent years reading labels on dog food bags, trying to establish a balance between good food and a reasonable price. Premium Edge is the answer to this quandary. I confess, I recently strayed to another brand in search of a food that I didn't have to drive thirty miles out of my way to get. On the surface the other food seemed to fit the bill (no wheat or corn). But after a few weeks on the other food, my old hound began shaking his head a lot and two hot spots appeared. I learned the hard way that this particular dog is allergic to soy products.<br /><br />So we've returned to our tried and true Premium Edge and, after two weeks, not only is hound better, but the other dogs' are glowing again (and I didn't even notice the loss of sheen). What a relief to find it on Amazon at a reasonable price and even more reasonable shipping charges.

At any rate, she eats it all immediately.  She looks better, her hair is shinier, and she seems to feel better.  So if she were voting I think she'd give it a paws-up.

review/text: My German Wirehaired Pointer had bad doggy BO.  It would return shortly after she was bathed.  My vet thought that it might be due to a food allergy, and suggested we try a food containing ingredients she had not been exposed to previously.  This Premium Edge food filled the bill, and it has reduced the doggy BO to normal levels.  The Amazon price for the food was friendly, and UPS delivered the heavy sack right to my door.  What's not to like?

review/summary: Seems to Be Good Food - Dogs Like It.  Does have an Odor While Other Premium Foods Do Not.
review/text: We have been through 3 brands of dog food over the past 3 years because of price/availability on Amazon.  This is the last (Amazon delivered) brand we tried because our regular brand became unavailable.<br /><br />The Premium Edge Salmon seems to have a quality list of ingredients & seems comparable to the Costco Salmon brand (Costco is slightly cheaper but Costco requires an annual membership fee & Amazon delivers to your doorstep).  The food does have an odor that we didn't find in our other premium foods, and I do not know the source of the odor (we previously have feed our dogs <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCWAFY">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Large Breed Adult Canine Formula Dry Dog Food, 30-Pound Bag</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NZPFB0">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken & Oats Dry Dog Food, 22.5-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The dogs do not seem to mind the odor & happily chow down on this food (they are slightly picky and, when I was in a food pinch, turned their noses up at Iams).  Their stools are firm & their coats are good & healthy.<br /><br />Because we go through so much dog food (120lbs/month), and because of availability issues that I've had with Amazon in the past, we will be switching to the Costco/Kirkland food.  However, if this is less of a concern for you & if you want your dog food delivered to your doorstep (a real plus), then this is a premium food that is worth trying. Both this brand & the Costco brand is manufactured by Diamond Pet Foods, a company that has had a lot of recalls in the past (in fact, both this food & the Costco food were subject to recall in early 2012).

review/text: The ingredients+price almost seem too good to be true.  That's my main thing lol...<br /><br />But basically I tried this food out because I am a vegetarian...because I do not like the way livestock is raised and what not.  It may seem stupid but switching to a fish based dog food is much more appealing to me than random parts of abused lamb, chickens, etc...not that my dog cares.<br /><br />When I opened the bag the biggest thing I noticed was the smell.  Not overly appetizing for me but it smelled like...food!  Burnt toast mostly...but it didn't smell like greasy crap like most dog foods do.  My dog also noticed this and was reluctant to eat it the first day.  She has warmed up to it a bit.  She still eats smaller portions but I believe that is because it is probably higher quality and she might feel full sooner.

review/summary: Dogs love the food - Premium Edge Skin & Coat Salmon, Pot & Veg
review/text: I have 2 large breeds; a Tibetan Mastiff 2 years old and a Newfie 8 years old. I used to buy the old Sam's brand Lamb and Rice formula - which is a good food, but I always had to add something to it, like milk, broth, treats to make it palatable to the pups. This formula doesn't require anything but the kibble, and so treats remain treats instead of part of the meal.<br /><br />They both eat it up without any issues; no digestive problems.<br /><br />I originally found out about it through our dog trainer. She suggested it because my Newfie is a senior and is starting to have allergies - itchy skin. We live in the South and have 2 long haired large dogs who are prone to allergies. This has helped some, but I keep them on it because they do eat it and the ingredients are high quality.<br /><br />I started giving them Omega 3,6,9s and Biotin again. I used to do this over a year ago and they both had beautiful hair and skin. My TM has some itching, but not bad - gorgeous coat. The Newfie is miserable and I hope putting her back on the Omega's and Biotin will reverse the issues. Her hair and skin was great when she was on them before, I just wasn't 100% sure it was the vitamins that helped. I will know soon enough and post my findings. Just put them back on them, so it may take me 2 months to update. I have also tried other holistic approaches to helping her with her skin as well as Benadryl - they help some, but not enough.<br /><br />Won't be disappointed and you can't beat that delivery is free, no tax and it comes straight to your door - I enjoy that I do not have to lug the large bags around Sam's. :)

review/summary: My dogs eat it. Ingredients are better than anything at the grocery store.
review/text: I didn't plan on writing a review for this product. I mean, it's dog food. I don't eat it! But I read a review or two that complained about dogs getting gas after eating this. I have three dogs: 11.0 pounds, 33 pounds and 96 pounds. I tried to mix like is always suggested, but my dogs just made a mess and picked out the new stuff like they always do. I held out and hoped they'd finish of the old brand, but they didn't, which is par for course with my dogs. (I'm weak.) So I just threw out what little was left of the old stuff and didn't bother mixing anymore. My two smaller dogs had no issues. My larger dog got some horrible gas, like she always does when we go through with food changes, and she seemed a bit bloated and crampy. That lasted about a day or two and she's been fine ever since. Well, old Sadie still has gas from time to time, but that's not uncommon for her size. At any rate, she's always gotten a case of the gas from time to time, just like her daddy (me). My bottom line: My dogs like it, my wife is satisfied with the ingredients, and the price isn't insane. I intend to buy it for awhile and see...

review/text: I got this bag just today. It arrived promptly in a giant box. Opened the box & the bag had no tears, scuffs, or any damage. Perfect condition. I dumped the dry food into my storage box & liked the fact there's no artificial colors. I also liked the small kibble size. It's perfect for any size dog to eat. I mix canned food into the dry & it mixes so much easier with the smaller bites. I add canned tuna or salmon cat food to the dry food. The fish oils seem to be good & healthy for them. Also makes their fur soft & shiney. But, do that only on your own accord, I'm NOT a vet!  My 3 big Labs went bonkers over this stuff. They scarfed it down like it was a hamburger. I got a kick out of them wagging their tails & chowing down on their food so happily. After dinner they drank their water, & went outside as usual. Came back in & were much obliged happy campers. There was no usual rolling around, itching, & scratching all over the place. They were calm, cool, and extremely satisfied & so am I. So I give this a positive 5 STARS!<br />I believe my dogs to have food allergies to the cheap dog foods out there, & will try to keep buying this fantastic food for them.

review/summary: Only Brand I now Recommend
review/text: I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called "premium" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.  "Lamb meal" contains ground bone and other waste as well as the meat itself; this manufacturer uses only the Meat.

They will not eat eat it!<br />The pieces are all the same size and color...Not appealing, and there is not even a smell that says "eat me, I am food".  Could be cardboard, judging by<br />the dog's reaction.<br /><br />Kind of hard to return, since it is opened and is 18 pounds of dog food.<br />I have a feeling it is either because the food is so old, or it is tainted.  Dogs can sense when there is a problem with food!<br /><br />Sorry about the bad review...But, This was money that will just end up getting poured into the rubbish.<br />Maybe I was only the unlucky one...Check the last sale dates on your package if any of your dogs wont eat it!<br /><br />I will stick to Pedigree and Mighty Dog..less expensive, not as healthy, but both my dogs love it.<br />I cannot recommend this brand..I have two large dogs, mixed breed and are not usually choosy about what they eat.<br />Except for the Premium Edge, which they give  a paws down to!

review/summary: Perfect sample pack for all levels of heat
review/text: I was always a fan of Dave's, so I bought this at a local store to try Blair's and I'm glad I did.  The jalepeno sause is very mild (for me) but one of the most delicious condiments I've ever tasted.  The Afterdeath is a bit painful, but still very tasty on rice & beans, burritos, or any chicken dish I've tried it on.  The Sudden Death kicked my ass when I underestimated it, but now a few drops in a dish or pot are just right if I want heat without changing flavor much.

What I got were two.<br /><br />The green and the red were so boring that I could be more impressed with average supermarket hot sauce, the sudden death and after death however had me sweating and breathing heavy.<br /><br />These also come with 2 cool keychain skulls that have blairs stamped on their heads.

Upon further inspection I noticed that they look a lot like larva and then I was horrified as I saw larger bugs in my coffee grounds.<br /><br />I am very upset about this, I use to love coffee from my brewer but have had a very hard time trying to drink a cup now, knowing that I could be drinking another cup of bug juice, makes me want to gag really. I do not understand how this was allowed to happen. You would think The Green Mountain Coffee Company would have a quality control department?

review/text: Ive been trying a few different brands and blends of k-cups recently and this one is by far my least favorite. To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me-i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste- long time coffee drinkers know this taste-ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other brands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation-i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this brand, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each.

I didn't order gift wrap but I did mark it as a gift and the vendor put the marked box they usually use inside a plain box so that it was a surprise.  Our order even included buttered popcorn Jelly Bellys, a favorite flavor!  I am always looking for $ 25.00-30.00 items to use as care packages. I suppose that if you added up all the great food it would be a little less than the price but the packaging is really fun and my daughter and I definitely feel that we got our money's worth.

I didn't even need to lift the package up to my nose, the fragrance is so strong and so authentically hazelnut.  I could feel my mouth starting to water at the prospect of enjoying delicious hazelnuts - one of my favorite nuts!  (It better be, I'm from the Northwest!)<br /><br />The flavor of the hazelnut is strong here, but, I'm glad it is.  It tastes so wonderful!  I can taste the vegetative sweetness of the Matcha, not so much of the bittersweet but more of the sweet here, hints of the bitterness are in the background though, and offer a nice contrast.<br /><br />Very deliciously nutty ... all that's missing is a nutty crunch!

She loved it, but it was more of an expensive treat.<br /><br />With a puppy, I needed something to satisfy her chewing urge. The treat fractured into small bits all over the floor but our dog was willing to pick those up. The pieces looked rather sharp and that was a concern. Others mentioned it was made in China and I would like to add the first ingredient is corn.  It might last longer for very small dogs.

review/summary: Safer than rawhide, don't last as long but also cleans teeth
review/text: I picked these up from my local pet shop for a bit cheaper than what they are on offer for from Amazon, so you might wish to shop around.<br /><br />Over all I am quite satisfied with these "bones." They are much safer than raw hide chews given they are made from dried chicken, which means unlike raw hide you know these are actually digestible. This is the biggest reason I bought them. My vet recommended not giving my Sheltie raw hide as they aren't properly digestible. Whether this is true or not, I've heeded her advice.<br /><br />Baird, my Sheltie, really seems to enjoy them. When he sees one coming out of the bag, his tail is wagging like crazy. He enjoys these as much as our old family Sheltie McGyver enjoyed raw hide. The only difference I see between these and raw hide is that raw hide lasted roughly 30 minutes longer in chew time than these. I'd say Baird can chew through one of these in about 30 or so minutes, while our old Sheltie could chew on a single raw hide for an hour, at which point we would throw away the little nub. There is nothing left of these bones after 30 minutes.<br /><br />As far as the dental application goes, it does smell of mint, so I assume it should, if nothing else, help with doggy breath, though to be fair Baird has never really had "doggy breath." I also use some dog mouth foam so I don't know what really keeps his breath "fresh" between the two.<br /><br />If you aren't too sure about raw hide for your dog and want something you know can be digested, these are definitely worth it.<br /><br />For those that try to keep track of where the things they give their dog come from, these are made in China. I've tried finding something similar not made in China, but it seems such a thing doesn't exist or I just can't find them.

review/summary: Addictive..in a good way!
review/text: My dogs just love these and the chews are safe for them. Their breath benefits from the mint and their dental exams show much less plaque . I must keep bags on hand; they expect them.

review/summary: picture of the package of the dog chew is not what I recieved
review/text: If you open the link to the Smartbones you will see that it shows a picture of a package containing a 3-pack of dog chews.  I did not get this bag, I recieved a single dog chew.  I was under the impression by looking at the description on the bag I was getting a single pkg of 3, Not just 1 dog chew.  This made these quite expensive and I ordered two :-(

A rich wonderful chocolate flavor! I told my husband I am going to need a constant supply of this stuff, I am addicted already! Definately a treat worth buying!

review/summary: underrated, give it credit, nothing compares to the original!!
review/text: You can't fully appreciate the packaged frozen hot chocolate until you've had the REAL frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3 in NYC. While it doesn't come close to the homemade kind you get there, it's a GREAT alternative for when you're really craving some or you miss it or you're just far away and can't have it, etc. It's all about adding your personal touch with the ice, maybe some whipped cream and cocoa shavings like they do at the restaurant. So no, it's not the chocolate dessert to end all chocolate desserts, because that's the ORIGINAL frozne hot chocolate, but this is a delicious, inexpensive, fast, substitute and makes a fabulous gift when paired with a mug or other coffee/sweet goodies. So that's the point, it's not to replace the original, it's just to satisfy some cravings, so if you've never had the original it might not be the best thing in the world to you but after you've had the original you'll find these packets will satisfy many, many cravings taht will follow! Hope that helps!  --Fellow chocolate love and frozen hot chocolate expert!

review/text: Saw this advertised on Oprah, and I must say she was 100% on the money when she said "it's the best" you can't go wrong with this one & now that I found out I can order from Amazon I not only save on the cost and I won't have to ration the packs.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: Really delicious and sooooo chocolately! Just like the real thing. I adjust the ratios of milk and mix to my liking and ignore the instructions on the back. You can also get alot more than 1 drink per package if you drink a normal sized glass (I get 3 shakes per pack at about 16 oz. per shake). Really good! A must try at least once in your life!

review/summary: Just "o.k " if you want a "Frosty" or a rich shake
review/text: Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix.
