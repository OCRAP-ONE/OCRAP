I will snack on it plain, but it is especially delicious with a dab of peanut butter. I like the peanut butter enhancement so much that I hardly even it it in milk anymore. Good stuff; I will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Great Cereal at a great price!
review/text: The savings on this cereal is over $1.00/box at the subscription price vs. my local Publix or Winn Dixie.  Wal-Mart price is close but I still would have to drive there and face the crowd and still pay a little more, but with Amazon I just have to open the door and walk it into the house and save money to boot.  Some have said they pay less than the price offered here at some stores but I haven't seen this particular cereal for less anywhere in my area and the generic's aren't the same even if they are little cheaper. Figure out how much you need and order accordingly, you don't have to get it every month, you can get the interval that works best for you.  I get it every other month.  the only issue that I just had was that they were out and there was a slight delay but that just tells me that I'm not the only one that thinks this is a great deal.

The new package is deceptive as it says "original" but once you taste the new ones, you will know that they are as far from original as you can get.  I have found that Keebler Zesta saltines are really good and I have switched to them after eating Nabisco saltines for 46 years.  It is ashamed that American manufacturers just can't leave a classic product alone and have ruined it.

review/text: These crackers are pretty good BUT Preppers be aware that after 6 months in a controlled temp, sealed with oxygen absorbers, dark pantry storage, the shortening or oil that is used in the baking process goes rancid. We tried this several times, thinking it was just a bad lot of crackers. After 3 tries over a 18 month period, the results were the same. They are very good crackers for every day use, but don't seem to hold up in storage, resulting in some rather expensive chicken food.<br /><br />We started making hardtack from a Civil War recipe that has a rather long shelf life.

review/text: I have been shopping for Nabisco Premium Saltines and have found them on the shelves but are not the original as the box claims every box that I find proclaims them to be original but stamped on the box it indicates that they are with sea salt (not original). I would like to know if they are still made with salt containing iodine which is a required ingredient for a healthy diet. Dietations have indicated that the American (United States of America) diet is iodine deficient, therefore, the crackers with sea salt is less healthy for us.  Where can I find them with Iodized salt if they are still made. If they are no longer available shame on you for producing a less healthy food product.

review/text: I order a wide variety of items from Amazon constantly.  However until now I have never been disappointed.  Having purchased real mexican vanilla for the past 19 years in trips to the Caribbean I've been amazed by the Xel-Ha brand that I always get.  The vanilla smell is incredible and when used in ice cream and baked goods it provides the best vanilla taste I've ever experienced.  This year I did not get back with enough vanilla that I had intended to give family and friends.  When ordering a few more bottles I was concerned about getting bad or mediocre vanilla so I made sure to order from Amazon.  This Golden Pure vanilla has almost no vanilla smell ... just a  strong alcohol smell.  When used in cookies it provided no discernible vanilla taste. Also there is no information about whether it does or does not contain cumarin (a natural substance that would be dangerous for someone on blood thinner).  Now I understand that I am simply out $25+ as the vanilla apparentlycannot be returned.  I'm surprised and disappointed.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474C7VU">Golden Pure Natural Mexican Vanilla, 8-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>

review/summary: Save your money
review/text: I have been searching for the perfect mocha K-cup ever since I bought my machine.  I thought I'd found it with Green Mountain Cafe Escapes, but was sorely disappointed.  Not only does it fail me with flavor, but it contains instant coffee and chemical cow.  I, foolishly, purchased the 96 count offering, so now I have about 91 cups of coffee that I will not enjoy to the the fullest.  It was a very costly mistake.<br /><br />Save your money on this item and go out and purchase a bottle of good chocolate milk (not the 1% stuff).  Use it with your favorite blend, such as Nantucket, and enjoy.

I found that these were not much different in flavor, or indeed not as good in flavor. They were broken pieces with a lot of bitter dark skin on them and twice as expensive as the Trader Joe's walnuts. I would not recommend these to anyone over the Trader Joe's walnuts.

review/text: I usually buy orange and lemon zest for cooking, when I don't make my own. I decided to get this for a new toothpaste recipe I picked up. Yeah, that sounds strange, but if you make your own toothpaste you don't have to worry about how much fluoride you are getting in it, and it is probably one-eighth the cost of commercially prepared products.<br />I decided if I was getting fluoride in tap water, I didn't need it in my toothpaste also. And now I am not sure I need it at all. It sure didn't seem to prevent cavities for me. So, since I can't find non-fluoridated toothpaste under $6 a tube at the store, I am going to be going for the Zesty life. Their lemon zest is great also!

review/text: I feel like this K-cup variety has been unnecessarily & harshly criticized both on Amazon and the Keurig site. It's kind of like a sweetened caffeinated hot chocolate. It's like what you'd expect a kid to order in a coffee shop or like a decaf starbuck's speciality drink. If you like those sorts of sweet drinks from coffee stores then you'll like this. The coffee flavour is weak, if you prefer starbucks drinks with 2 shots of espresso... you're not gonna like this. I think it's something you can drink in the afternoon or at night that isn't going to keep you up. If you prefer a bolder coffee taste go for some of the cappuccino k-cups.

Why use both?<br /><br />Also, I agree with another reviewer who said it really just tastes like hot chocolate. I could hardly taste any coffee flavor at all.<br /><br />Very disappointing. :(

review/text: Cafe mocha, I mean who doesn't enjoy a sweet cup of coffee with a delicious chocolate overtone. I sure do. I dream of them and looked forward to trying this. This was a nightmare :P  &lt;--- that was exactly what my face looked liked.<br /><br />I wish companies would be at least label their products that have artificial sweetener... as in this case sucralose. Sucralose has a nasty after and beginning taste in my opinion. I don't ever buy products intentionally that have this in it. If you don't mind sucralose, then it probably wouldn't bother you.<br /><br />However, if you dare to continue and try your own cup. Let me warn you. It doesn't have a coffee flavor. Or maybe a mild one.I couldn't get passed the sucralose taste. It is instant coffee as well. (no grinds in the filter left)<br /><br />As suggested by others stick to the reg. coffee and add some Andes mints or your own favorite hot chocolate to it.

review/summary: Not Coffee
review/text: This is really good stuff if its cocoa you want. I didnt really taste coffee at all..I found that if I make a 6oz cup of regular coffee first then add a 6oz cup of this stuff it makes the perfect 12oz cup of mocha coffee. still good as cocoa in the evening too.....Its dual purpose!!!!

review/summary: chemical taste
review/text: I just brewed the coffee and thought it smelled and tasted awful. There is sucralose on top of sugar so it is extremely sweet and it leaves an aftertaste. To me, it was like a coffee mixed with a cheap chocolate syrup. Very disappointing...

review/summary: Very Tasty
review/text: I purchased the Cafe Mocha when Amazon was having a sale on the pack of 3, otherwise, the regular price is much to expensive and not worth it.  The mocha was good, but a bit too sweet for my taste, so I mixed it with a small (espresso shot) k-cup of regular coffee, which made it taste like a mocha from Starbucks. You can also get the same taste if you use a k-cup of hot chocolate and combine it with a k-cup of regular or decaf coffee... and it will still be less costly than the Cafe Escapes at regular price.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy with the product and would continue to buy, if only the price was better.

review/summary: Really pretty good stuff.
review/text: I know people have knocked this in other reviews, but I actually think its pretty good stuff. Yes, if you can accept that it really is a powdered drink (There isn't real coffee in this, the cup is just filled with powder that dissolves in the hot water), you'll love it!. I have no idea if it really has caffeine, but I think its got a great taste. I keep a box around for people that don't like regular coffee, and everyone has loved it. I'll even have one from time to time if I want a sugar fix.

review/summary: Funny after taste
review/text: I couldn't wait to receive these Cafe Mocha flavored K-cups and try them. I was sadly disappointed in the first sip, there was a funny after taste. I tried it again, funny after taste was still present. Just to make sure it wasn't just me I had other co-workers try it too and they also thought it tasted funny. Don't waste your money.

review/summary: Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha for Keurig
review/text: When I purchased this product, I was under the impression that it was real coffee with mocha and not instant coffee with mocha.  This is quite a rip-off and I am taking the remainder of what I purchased back to the store or sending back to the manufacturer.  Finally, the taste is awful.  It is easier to make a cup of instant and add a little Swiss Miss hot chocolate and it would taste better.

review/summary: Not my favourite
review/text: I think these must be instant coffee b/c the cups feel empty when they're done, unlike the coffee ones which feel a little heavier b/c of the grounds and filter inside. Anyway, they taste like instant coffee and hot chocolate - not the greatest combination. I would also like it to be a bit creamier. With some creamer added they are tolerable. I won't buy them again, too bad I bought 24.

review/summary: Yum!
review/text: I love Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha but it seems to sell-out at the stores quicker then they can stock it.  I'm used to buying the 18-Count Packs which is what they sell in the stores and when I ordered these I didn't realize they were 12-Count Packs.  The 18-Count Packs run about $11-$12 per Pack in stores so you're not saving any money here by buying 3 12-Count Packs but on the other hand, they always seem to be out of stock in my local stores so the convenience of being able to order it through Amazon was a plus and delivery was very quick!

review/text: I am not a coffee drinker but when I do drink coffee, I like it sweetened. This Cafe Mocha K-cup is a *perfect* blend. It's chocolatey-sweet coffee! And best thing is I don't need to add any sweetener or creamer. It's perfect as it is.<br /><br />Don't buy this if you expect it to be a more bitter coffee taste. This is more like the mocha blends you get at a coffee shop.

review/text: I actually love this product, just not by itself.  I make a large coffee, by adding 6oz of a bold coffee Emeril's Big Easy Bold coffee then 8oz of Cafe Mocha.  It is now my favorite Mocha.  I have tried it with Hot chocolate, and it just doesn't do the trick.  For a little extra flavor I add in some Andes chocolate mint pieces to make a Mint Mocha.  It is worth getting up in the morning for.
