review/summary: Great Cat Food!
review/text: My cats love this cat food.  They enjoy the shredded meat and chunks of potatoes and vegetables.  This is a great supplement to commercial wet food, which I use when higher quality cat food is not available.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I think they have changed some of their recipes.  My cats used to love the Steak Frites, but they don't like the new version at all.  I still think the food is good and very high quality, though.

review/text: I'm a big fan of Weruva cat food, but my cats weren't thrilled with this particular flavor. They ate most of it, but didn't "dig in" like they usually do - just kind of picked at it. The dog, on the other hand, was more than happy to finish it off for them. I must admit that I was kind of glad when they didn't wolf it down, because it definitely smells very fishy and I was happy that I wouldn't have to buy it again! :)

review/text: I have two cats that are very picky eaters, sometime ago I found out about weruvia and they seemed to really enjoy it. So, in order to keep my furry friends happy and save some money I purchased weruvia online, and to my my surprise one of them would not eat it at all. I discovered that the food I purchased online unlike the one I was buying at the pet store was made in Thailand. I found a can from a previous purchase which had been made in the USA and the cat ate it without a problem. So, I wondering if anyone has had the same problems???

review/summary: Weruva Paw Lickin' Chicken wet cat food
review/text: I have two diabetic senior cats in my brood and I try to make sure I feel them all the best quality food I can fit into my budget.  The cats do love this food and I feel good feeding it to them because it is high quality.  The ingredients read like human-food, there are virtually no preservatives and it doesn't have that "cat food" smell.  The cats always lick off all of the "broth" it's packed in before moving on to the shreds of chicken breast itself.<br /><br />My only caveat is the cost.  Yes, I know you pay more for good quality cat food but I have read that even a lower quality wet food is better for your cats than a diet consisting of only dry food, even if it's the best dry food.  I feed my cats wet food once daily and they have "grazing priviledges" with a bowl of high quality dry food (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C1WE5O">Solid Gold Indigo Moon Holistic Cat Food</a>) that I typically have to fill once a day.  I may buy this once in a while as a treat but they seem to enjoy the less expensive leading brand just as much.

review/summary: rich and refreshing, if slightly mellow: very reliable quality
review/text: In terms of richness, this makes a good strong cup of tea with just one bag.  A "yummy" effect, similar to Yorkshire Gold, but with a bit more straw/honey note, less wood.  It will stand up to a little milk, not much.  Halfway between breakfast (toasty/straw-mellow) and afternoon (fresh-wood/brisk/bitter) tea.  If you don't use milk and are watching your budget, one bag of this would match two bags of common US tea and come out smoother.  A perfect tea to go with a big lunch...makes other things taste rich too.  I enjoy it a lot, although I need a more barky afternoon flavor sometimes.  Don't let it chill: bitters sneak in.  Consume hot.  Teabag doesn't muffle it much, compared to open brewing. A solid daily black tea.<br />I almost forgot: I've had better teas, but they were very inconsistent, buy-to-buy.  This is very repeatable in quality.

review/text: I love Amazon, I buy nearly everything I can manage to buy through Amazon, and as these waters are pretty expensive at the nearest local grocery store ($4.50/12 pack of cans (this item)), I thought I would try to buy some from Amazon. I read the description, but I really thought I was buying several boxes of these - Especially considering that they cost about $20.<br /><br />You can imagine my shock and dismay when the UPS man showed up, with a twelve pack. One box of twelve cans.<br /><br />I tried to return it, I could have bought four of these for what I paid here. I've never been so disappointed with Amazon.<br /><br />I love Amazon, I truly do, but the fact that they charged me an astronomical rate for this is most unfair, and the no-returns policy is bunk. I didn 't open the box, I still haven't opened the box. Most expensive cans of water I have ever bought.

review/summary: Quality White Tea at a Great Price
review/text: For those of you unfamiliar with white tea, it comes from the same plant as green tea, and has all the health benefits.  White tea is picked during a small period of the year, before the buds and leaves have opened.  This gives it a much more delicate flavor (read: doesn't taste like cabbage the way green tea does).<br /><br />For those of you who are tea snobs, this is Bai Mu Dan (aka white peony), which is picked from March 15-April 10 of each year.  It is not quite as rare as silver needle, and has a bit more flavor.<br /><br />I was looking for some white tea for a regular morning cup, and I came across this bag, with a very low cost per ounce.  I'd ordered Numi before and liked it so I took a chance and was not disappointed.  Mine came in a large black, resealable bag, rather than the paper one pictured.  It is quite a bit of tea for the price.  The leaves and buds are in good condition, large and mostly unbroken (see my user image for an example), and dried to a nice green color like they should be.<br /><br />The tea has a great flavor, more substantial than silver needle, but still very light and drinkable.  I'd definitely order this again, but I'll be a while going through the 1lb bag.

Because the flavors are so light and delicate, you must use good-quality water and very clean brewing equipment to avoid imparting any off-flavors. This is a relatively low grade of white tea, but it's still an excellent bargain at this price and a great introduction for white tea newbies.

review/summary: Too Sweet. Too Fatty. Too Little.
review/text: I bought this bacon jerky after having been delighted with the bacon jerky available at Walgreens. This bacon jerky was about twice as expensive, but I thought that it might be worth it due to delicious sweet maple flavor. I was wrong. First of all, the maple flavor is overwhelming. Instead of complimenting the smokiness of the bacon, the two flavors seem to be in direct competition. Further, the bacon jerky was incredibly fatty and sticky from the maple syrup. It made it incredibly difficult to eat without constantly wanting some kind of moist towelette.<br /><br />For the small amount of bacon jerky you get, it's simply not worth the price. As sad as it sounds, I'll be going back to Walgreens for their "Nice" brand bacon jerky.

review/summary: One of the three best coffee candies & one of the worst
review/text: These are a semi hard candy--not hard like a Lifesaver, but like a hard toffee that will soften somewhat in your mouth. The flavor, when it's good, is that of a medium bodied coffee; not nearly as piquant or as strong as the Bali or Kopiko brands but pleasant. However, I have found that from one case to the next the flavor can be wildly different, varying from a nice full bodied coffee flavor to what I imagine coffee would taste like if you boiled it for a while with an old leather belt in the pot. So some cases rate 5 stars and some rate 1. It's a gamble at best.<br /><br />The pieces are larger than the Bali, smaller than the Kopiko and I doubt most folks would find them uncomfortably large. They are not nearly as large as the Coffee Nips brand, which are annoyingly big on size and disappointingly small on flavor.<br /><br />The unwrap easily, which is a plus if you like them.<br /><br />_______________Coffee Flavor_____________Texture<br />Bali...........piquant/rich/strong.............hard sugar<br />Rio............moderate-varies by batch......hard toffee<br />United.........moderate.......................hard sugar<br />Kopiko.........piquant/rich strong............hard sugar<br />Coffee Nips....weak/bland.....................hard toffee

review/summary: WOW! will be a regular in my candy jar from now on
review/text: Coffee Rio Original Roast is a dark brown, tube-shaped, firmly chewy candy. When you first put it in your mouth, it almost feels like a hard candy. But as it remains in your mouth a while it begins to get a little softer; not enough softer to stop being a danger to loose fillings and crowns. It too is not overly sweet, I might like it a little sweeter. Since coffee is the #6 ingredient on a list of 8, it seems strange that Coffee Rio Original has as much strong tasting coffee flavor as United and Kopiko, but it does. Be sure and have your dentist's phone # handy.<br />8 out of 10<br />  FYI- United, Kopiko and Coffee Rio were the top finishing coffee candies in my taste test.<br />  God bless. Mike

review/summary: Very Nice Medium Roast Flavor
review/text: To cut to the chase, this produces a very good MEDIUM roast style cup of coffee...period. Some folks tend to compare all coffees to one another no matter what the bean is and how it's roasted. I do roast my own green beans (home roaster) when I brew a pot of coffee every morning and use the K-Cups when only a single cup is needed. If you don't like that 'in your face' dark roast, dense, heavy style of coffee in the morning (or any time for that matter) this is definitely the coffee for you. It's not bitter, a bit floral, with a true pure coffee taste. Does it match Dunkin Donuts style coffee in taste? I'd say YES to that when using the middle cup size setting on the Keurig brewer....which I use for folks that take milk in their cup, I use the larger cup setting because I drink my coffee black and like that taste profile. The new packaging is OK (you get 2 extra K-Cups for the $$) as long as you have the room in your kitchen to store the larger single box....as opposed to storing the two 24 cartridge boxes.<br /><br />NOTE: The description of this coffee uses the words "Medium Extra Bold" in it's packaging as opposed to the two 24 boxes version which lead me to think there was now two DIFFERENT varieties of this Donut Shop coffee....so I ordered both (wanted 98/100 anyway) but it turns out that both were the same. Amazon should correct that description  and take out 'Extra Bold' so they match each other.

review/summary: My Favorite by a Landslide so Far
review/text: I must admit that I have gone a little overboard with my k-cup sampling.  So far I must have tried about 50 different blends.  OVerall I must say that the vast majority of them have been pleasant, better than what I used to make in my coffee brewer.  Then I tried the Donut Shop brand.  When I first tried this I was not expecting much, it sounds bland, plain, everyday type of coffee.  Don't get me wrong, I have had some pretty good cups of coffee in donut shops but nothing to write home about.  When I took my first sip, I thought wow, this is amazing.  Smooth, not much of an acid taste, about as close to perfect as I could describe.  My love for this k-cup continued and continues to this day.  Many times you find a k-cup which at first is very good, but after a couple of cups you get a little sick of them; not with this one.  It has been and continues to be my absolute favorite.  I will still search for something better, but I doubt I will find it.  I hope you like -- no strike that -- I hope you love this coffee as much as I do.

review/summary: Great Coffee--competetive price!
review/text: I've had my Keurig brewer for 5 months and have tried a lot of brands and the Coffee People Donut Shop regular is among my favorites. Green Mountain Nantucket Blend and Timothy's Italian Blend are also favorites.<br /><br />One reviewer remarked about Subscribe & Save costing less. It's only a dollar and a few pennies cheaper than this packaging and Subscribe and Save does not offer Donut Shop "regular" but instead has "Extra Bold". Also, this packaging gives you 50 k-cups as opposed to 48 (2) 24 count packages in Subscribe & Save.<br /><br />Another reviewer complained about not having the standard boxes to dispense the coffee. I purchased a K-Cup carousel, available on Amazon for $19.95 that holds 26 k-cups; it looks nicer by my Keurig than cardboard boxes.

review/summary: Wake Up To Caffienated Perfection!
review/text: We purchased a Keurig brewing system early this year, so we've been trying out as many different varieties of coffee as possible. This coffee is -- BAR NONE -- the best of the bunch. It is rich, syrupy and just a bit sweet. My experience, thus far, has been that the K-Cups listed as "extra bold" produce the best cups of coffee, but many of those are only available in dark roasts, while I prefer a medium roast. If you're a fan of a good, old fashioned diner-style cup of coffee (like what you can get if you go to Dunkin Donuts or somewhere like that), then this is the brew for you. We love it and make sure we always have some on hand.

review/summary: Great taste - poor packaging wastes k-cups
review/text: I love the taste of this coffee.  But apparently they have poor quality control.  These K-cups come too full and they tend to not brew properly.  You can always tell when you got a bad cup, because the grounds are so packed in the cup that the water doesn't come out completely and your cup of coffee will have less liquid than you are used to.  Sure enough, when you go to lift the K-cup out of the Keurig for disposal, you will find it is very heavy compared to others. We also know this is a problem with Coffee People DOnut Shop k-cups only, because my husband drinks a different brand and never has this problem.<br /><br />It doesn't happen all the time, and I have found if I shake the k-cup before putting it in the Keurig, it happens less frequently, but it still happens.<br /><br />I've tried ordering from Coffee People multiple times to see if it was a one time manufacturing glitch, but it appears every time I buy a box of their K-cups I have a problem with 10-15% of them.<br /><br />Fortunately, another brand is offering a donut shop coffee which I tried with this last order and I find it just as pleasing.

review/text: My husband and I are crazy about Coffee People k-cups.  A friend gave us a box of the "Donut Shop" cups and they are spectacular.  Very rich and bold, not bitter, but packs a nice punch.  Reminds me of coffee from an old-fashioned percolator.  A good, strong cup of coffee is hard to come by when you are using some of these newer brewing machines, but the Keurig system is definitely the exception and this variety of k-cup is the best we have ever tasted.

review/summary: A perfect "Anytime" coffee that is sure to please.
review/text: I have tried many, many brands and blends in my Keurig coffee maker and this is definetely one of my favorites.  The type of coffe I drink depends on my mood.  Sometimes I want a strong, bold cup like, Newman's Own Extra-bold Special Blend K-cups, 80 Pk for Keurig Brewers and sometimes I want something more mild like, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NP30XQ">Green Mountain K-Cup Single-Serving Coffee 108-ct.- Nantucket Blend</a>  But ever since I have had my Keurig I have been looking for one of my favorite coffees.  The Dunkin Donut brand.<br /><br />This coffee is superb and very much like the Dunkin Donut brand.  Not bold or bitter.  Not weak or under flavored.  It is smooth and very flavorful.  It is the perfect crowd pleasing blend for any time of day or night.<br /><br />I have shopped all over and you can't beat the variety or the price here on Amazon when you join their club.  A great value.<br /><br />I do wish that Amazon would change the name by removing "Extra Bold".  It is not.  It is, at most, a medium roast.  Even when brewed with the smallest setting of the Keurig I would not concider it bold.  It comes out great on the medium size setting.  Very remanicent of that great cup of Joe you would get in the old days at your favorite diner.

review/summary: Quality control needed ASAP!
review/text: Just left packaging feedback, but upon review, the issue appears to be quality control.  I ordered 2 boxes, 50 count each.  In both boxes, the foil lids were not positioned correctly and the seal was not 100%, causing coffee grounds to coat every K-Cup, the frustration free boxes and the box they were shipped in.  Worse, about 20% of the K-Cups no longer have the full amount of coffee in them.  Additionally, I am not sure that these loose grounds won't impact the Keurig.  I hope the folk at Coffee People can rectify this situation, as this is my favorite coffee, but I will not order this product again without some resolve on their side.

review/summary: Poor Quality - Extremely Disappointed
review/text: I purchased 5 pounds of this product directly from Barry Farms for my grandmother's recipe fruitcakes.  I was so disappointed in the quality of what I received.  Of the 5 pounds, 2 pounds was of yellow pineapple that was inedible and had to be discarded.  The pith of the pineapple was used rather than the good part of the fruit.  There was no way I was going to use that in these high quality expensive cakes.  Also, there was a lot of syrup in each tub, so I definitely did not get a pound of fruit. I ended up having to replace the bad pineapple at a local grocery store for twice the cost.  I guess I got what I paid for.  I will not purchase from them again.  I just went to their web-site and there is nothing there.  Maybe they have gone out of business.  If this is an example of their product, I'm not surprised.

review/text: Nutritionists recommend that you get a serving of vegetables with every meal, but how to accomplish that with a breakfast has always been a tough one for me since I don't like starchy vegetables like potatoes, and aside from cutting up a tomato, few other things go well with yogurt, egg whites, oatmeal, or any of the other stuff I like in the morning. A simple glass of V8 works perfectly. I've always loved V8 juice for that reason, but found it just a tad too salty. The low sodium version has made V8 perfect in my opinion. It has more flavor than most tomato juices, with a nice hint of celery seed. (It also makes a mean Bloody Mary!).<br /><br />I've only given this particular version 3 stars because the shipping costs are not worth it. With the many PRIME eligible options available for V8, save yourself some cash and get one that ships for free.

review/summary: Healthy food for your furry babies
review/text: I started really reading labels on our foods last year when my husband started culinary school.<br />I was appalled at some of the things stuck in our everyday foods so they'll still have taste after<br />being over-processed, fillers to stretch them and chemicals to make them last for a couple years<br />on the shelf.<br /><br />Then I moved on to our cat food.  Same scenario!<br />Cats are carnivores.  Despite how great it sounds to see "balanced diet" on the front of<br />our cat food packages, cats do not need the SAME diet that humans do!  They do NOT need grains,<br />especially corn and corn fillers. Yet, you'll see package after package with the main ingredient<br />being corn meal or wheat by products. No wonder our kitties get itchy skin, dull coats and<br />get chubby (fillers fatten them up, just like it does to people!)<br /><br />I thought I'd try this food, because of the fiber content. Our oldest cat was having some problems<br />with constipation. Since he really didn't appreciate the petroleum jelly on a Q-tip to help him out,<br />I started looking for foods or treats that might help. Then I found this food.<br /><br />I would have never imagined a cat would like pumpkin, but they do! This has sort of a pumpkin soup<br />base, with real shredded chicken meat. (I took a photo, but it didn't turn out too great. I'll try<br />again next time I serve it.) Both cats seemed to really take to it, and our littlest cat didn't leave a speck<br />of pumpkin in the bowl. Neither one really seemed to finish off the chicken for some reason.<br /><br />I can't serve this brand all the time, simply because of the cost. I know quality costs more, but it is still<br />a little hard on my budget right now. But, I'll keep getting it when I can, and treating them whenever possible.<br />I'd definitely recommend it.

review/summary: Finding Soulistic is like hitting the kitty jackpot!
review/text: If you have a furry feline who deserves nothing but the best, especially if she/he has a renal (kidney) issue, Soulistic is like a 7-7-7 at the slots. Since watching my cat's phosphorus, magnesium, sodium and protein levels like a hawk, I've been lucky to have this tasty, quality, human-grade food to supply my baby with the moisture and yummy taste that he deserves. Any cat would welcome similar spoiling--and this food prolongs his life and awards him a happy demeanor at the same time. Like many others on this board, I take the time to read labels and decide for myself whether or not something is of real quality. With Soulistic, I pull out the magic bullet blender and combine pouch flavors (blue + grey OR red + green), then add some extra tablespoons of water, and produce a nice shake to dole out in his daily feedings. This process makes it easy to add in his L-Lysine powder (from grinding the tablets in a mortar and pestle) and glucosamine to mix everything up and mask any remaining aftertaste. A recent trip to the vet proves that his creatinine levels have dropped considerably, and that even though he will need to be checked regularly for his kidney issues, that we are on the right path. Clearly you don't have to go to the lengths I do for your pet to love these creations. But don't underestimate how much you and your cat will love this food! Finally, the pouches make for the easiest disposal and less volume in the garbage. Only Petco and Amazon carry this food. Great job, Soulistic!

review/summary: My cats love it!
review/text: I have 1 female & 2 male 10 year old tabby cats. Both of my males have had a problem with constipation. My vet suggested to regulary give pumpkin and hairball jelly to help them. I want to give my cats only good healthy food so I researched different foods and this brand seemed to be the best. I bought the pouches & the cans. All 3 cats love it! I mix it with their vet food a few times a week and they gobble it up. I also give them the hairball jelly every morning as a preventitive and they haven't had any more constipation problems. I am very happy with this food and will continue to buy it.

review/summary: Literally Just What I Asked For
review/text: I should have named my Yellow Lab Thief because he seeks only to kill and destroy. (Gospel of John 10:10). He ate the outlets off the back of my house. He ate part of my car...You get the idea. The only toys  he can play with are the solid Nylabone (no rubber , no matter how hard). He even breaks through bones and figured out how to chew the top off a Kong to get the treat inside. But he loves hidden treats. So I begged Nylabone to make a hollow Nylabone and sure enough they did. My Lab absolutely LOVES it. He carries it around and the only thing that comes close is his Frisbee. Can't recommend this enough. There are plenty of teeth marks on the trunk but it's still great and keeps him busy trying to get treats out of the "log." I even tweeted Nylabone a photo. This is literally just what I asked for? You'll love how your furry friend will love it!

review/summary: Something for the super chewy dog
review/text: I have purchased many nylabones and have had success with dogs that love to chew toys.<br /><br />I got a new dog who doesn't like chew toys but does like food, a lot. And at the same time, if he does chew something he could easily destroy it.  I thought that if I put peanut butter or something like that in this hollow part of the dura chew he'd enjoy working at getting the food and not destroy the nylabone in the process. In addition it has 'branches' for him to help hold the chew bone in place.<br /><br />It didn't work out the way I expected.  It's too heavy for him to want to carry around and he can't get his tongue very far in the hole so he gets frustrated. I'd almost say it's a little too indestructable. Once he gets the food that is accessable to him out he puts it aside.<br /><br />It's a good toy for dogs that like nylabones. The hollowed out part didn't work like I thought it would.

It wasn't until I found the toy outside a few days later and picked it up, realizing that it's not solid.  Makes me wonder what other toys are not solid from NB.  We still love the brand, but I would examine new toys carefully before buying them to see if I can tell if they are solid or not.

review/summary: Our dog totally adored this, but destroyed it in about 48 hours
review/text: We picked up one of these bones at a local pet store last week. Our dog picked it out herself; I held out two different shaped bones for her to sniff to see if she had a preference, and she actually grabbed this one's package out of my hand. She's never shown that much interest in something in the distracting environment of a store, so it came home with us. For two days, it was her constant companion, she absolutely LOVED this bone. She'd grab the whole thing around the middle and chew it on her back teeth with her head tilted back, so that she was chewing the red part more than the nubs. This might account for it's early demise... at the end of the second day I found it on her dog bed in three pieces, including one that was just the right size for an intestinal obstruction, and I quietly made it disappear while she wasn't watching. She's still looking for it two days later, sadly, and I thought about trying another one in the largest size available, but I don't think I want to risk it. We got the wolf-size the first time, and our dog is a 48 lb. Boykin Spaniel/Pit Bull mix. She is is a pretty serious chewer - she's the only dog I've ever had chew a Nylabone Galileo down to a nub that had to be thrown away and replaced - so this might not be a problem for most dogs.

review/text: I have a 70 lb lab/hound mix who loves to chew, so I always buy her the Nylabone Durachew toys. This is my first time buying this one for her and it arrived today. She's had it for about 4 hours and is already destroying it and I literally just saw her eating pieces of it as I'm typing this. It's going in the trash. Summary: My dog absolutely loves it and I don't. I should have ordered her another Galileo; it might shed little white flecks on the floor or injure my children when she flings it across the floor, but it's a lot more durable and safer for her to chew on than this one (and she loves it).

So I bought one for her to play with here at home.  That was yesterday, and she has barely touched her other toys since she received this.  She is a powerful chewer, despite being only 21 lbs. and she has already done a bit of damage to the ends, but nothing that would require my taking it away.<br /><br />One thing I noticed, is that this toy is made in China while other Nylabone toys say, "Made in USA."  Well, either way, I will keep this one until she destroys it, but I think I will take it away from her when I'm not around.  I don't want her playing with this one unsupervised.<br /><br />Nylabone is great, my dog always has to have at least one or two around at all times!

Beagles on the small end up to 50-65 pounds.<br /><br />The giant size (souper) is for very large dogs over 65 pounds.

review/text: Our six year old 92 pound Old English Bulldog and his partner in crime our 6 month old puppy of the same breed - are the certified kings when it comes to destroying even the toughest toys. A long time fan of Nylabone products - because they design toys with the dog in mind and not humans, and have been producing some of the finest, most durable dog toys here in the United States for over 50 years.<br /><br />A rarity among dog toys that beg for our attention with an army of adorable kitty cats, bunnies and an endless parade of cute toys.<br />With the majority of them resembling road kill in a very short time.That said, we had a feeling this particular toy being  made of the so rock solid Dura Chew material and scented like Bacon - they would be a huge hit.And boy, were they ever. Our Bulldogs simply LOVE this toy!<br /><br />Our oldest  Bulldog "Harley" is finicky about toys and loses interest after a hours, but kept this chew bone in his mouth for hours - even walking around the house with it looking like he was puffing on a big fat ole' stogie.Elvis, our 6 month old Godzilla chewer couldn't leave it alone for one second - and managed to do some serious damage.<br /><br />This toy is just Great.<br /><br />1) Huge size makes it fun for any medium - giant size dog.<br /><br />2) Can be carried around (or dragged)  if your pooch is strong to lift it.<br /><br />3) Holds up very well, the material is surprisingly strong and resilient.<br /><br />4) Quality construction means no seams - no pulling the top cover off.<br /><br />5) Bacon flavor is very subtle and adds to cranking up the crazy. Making this toy even more fun for your dog.<br /><br />6) Wood texture is molded into toy<br /><br />7) Thick but Hollow so adding a treat to crank up the crazy is effortless to do.<br /><br />If you're looking for an excellent toy, that can stand up to big time chewers - you can't go wrong with huge stick from Nylabone.<br />Like any dog toy supervision is key and an effort should be made to enjoy this toy along with your pooch under a watchful eye.<br /><br />5 PAWS UP!

review/summary: Loves but didn't last
review/text: We have a golden doodle who is a strong chewer. His nylabones usually last but he chewed this one in half in about a week. He absolutely loves this toy though. It is his favorite even a month later when he only has a part of it left. If he wasn't such a strong chewer I would definitely get this toy again.

review/summary: Best Dog Bone
review/text: We have an American Bulldog, that loves to chew and play with her toys.  Usually toys last hours, never days. Her Nylabone has lasted months.  I'm buying her another, just so she can have a second one.  Of all her toys, it is her favorite.  The bacon flavor is a PLUS.  After a while it does look chewed up but it's long lasting, by far.  These and Tuffy's are our favorites.  I will not by anything else.

review/summary: My Dog Likes It
review/text: I have tried giving my dog, a heavy chewer that can demolish large reindeer antlers within a day, a variety of different Nylabone products.  The problem with many Nylabone products is that they are plastic or rubber and their flavor is not particularly attractive to the dog.  As a result, my dog is often quick to abandon them for the furniture, my sneakers or any of the other things that we buy them these products to prevent them from chewing.  I tried giving this Nylabone DuraChew Hollow Stick Dog Chew to my dog because 1) it is bacon flavored so I hoped my dog would like the taste and 2) it looked a little bit different from the other Nylabones.  So far my dog has spent more time working over this particular Nylabone than he has almost any other plastic or rubber chewing toy that I have given him.  I am not sure whether it is the flavor or texture that he likes.  But I am thrilled to give him something other than rawhide that he likes to chew on.  Like other Nylabone products, the DuraChew Hollow Dog Chew is extremely tough.  I believe it was designed specifically for heavy chewers.  While my dog has definitely made some dents in it, it is still in pretty good shape and I expect it to last two or three months.  Every dog is different and you never know exactly what they will like.  But if your dog is a heavy chewer and you want to try something a little different from most Nylabones you might want to give this a try.

review/text: The Roland assorted entertainment collection are very good crackers.  A well rounded assortment to use for parties or simply for personal enjoyment.  I like them with peanut butter or a nice slice of cheese .

review/summary: OK, not great.
review/text: If you want to bake a fruit cake and it's nowhere near Christmas, sources of candied peel are few and far between.  This was OK, but not great.  The fruit part was fine, but it was mixed in with food coloring, high fructose corn syrup, and other chemical preservatives.

review/summary: Best Madeleines Ever! Yum! Lovely and tasty gift!
review/text: I sent these to a true Madeleine afficionada (loved 'em for decades) & she proclaimed that they were truly wonderful. I think it is great that they are wrapped in groups of 3 to preserve freshness & limit over-eating.  Well done! Best Madeleine cookies ever!!!<br /><br />Update: 6 months later. These have been kept in the freezer. Thaw a few minutes-they are terrific. Had the opportunity to taste-test this. Light, lemony, buttery-beautiful aroma, taste and texture. This is the new standard in Madeleines! Fresh from bakery tasted alongside-good, but no comparison!<br /><br />Update: Repeat buyer-these are the best. The hint of lemon adds an extra zing, but they ere smooth and elegant. Great gift!  A really fine treat.

review/summary: Good
review/text: My daughter just loves it. However it is a bit lumpier than the rice cereal, you have to add more water because it becomes too thick. Anyway, it is a great product!
