review/summary: Golden Valley Natural Beef Jerky, Peppereed
review/text: It's a good snack.  Beef a little chewy, but not as bad as others.<br />Sucks that you can't just open the bag and slowly snack on it.<br />The packaging says that it must be consumed within 3 days!<br />I stretched it out to 2 weeks.  Minus 1 star because i had to rush my snacks.

review/summary: icky
review/text: hard to explain why this was so gross, the texture of it was like it had a sticky film of tripe or something on it. tasted ok but felt icky in my mouth  . it also wasnt the best smelling jerky either. alot of the peices had really rough texture like there was still cartilige in it or something -and you literally could not chew it. some peices were better than others within the same package, but compared to most others beef jerky ive had, ill only give it one star.

review/summary: Amazing
review/text: I saw a lot of reviews that say this jerky is not good. I hate to say it but if you aren't from the Pacific NW then you probably won't like flavors from that area. My husband and I are from Idaho which is where this jerky is made, so we love it. We don't live in Idaho now but this is the only jerky my husband wants me to send him (he is deployed). Great jerky!

review/summary: Good stuff, but not super chewy
review/text: I tend to like very chewy jerky.  I'm looking for a lowfat, high-protein snack but if I'm going to add something like jerky to my diet I can't have all the usual chemicals and such.  So, this product is an excellent price and as far as I'm concerned it tastes great, but it's a softer jerky, almost exactly like Pemmican.  Part of the fun with jerky, and why it's such a good snack, as far as I'm concerned, is that it takes awhile to eat it.  THis is easier to eat, but that's not a huge deal, really.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  The "consume within 3 days of opening" seems a little odd to me, considering it's a 1 lb. bag.  I keep it in the fridge and it's lasted several weeks without an issue.  Tastes great without all the bad stuff and it doesn't cost an arm & a leg, which is what I was looking for.

review/summary: So good
review/text: I'm not sure why people here review this brand and flavor so poorly here.  A good part of me thinks it's because they're so used to the chemical taste and artificial flavorings of the big brands (MSG laden jerkys, or loaded with flavorings and preservatives).<br /><br />Anyway, back to the jerky...<br /><br />I work out, run, and teach cardio kickbox classes weekly and without lots of serious, natural protein, I will feel it within a few days.  Without exception, every other brand of jerky I've tried either uses MSG or contains so many preservatives I feel sick after eating enough to fit my needs.  Stay away from World Kitchens -- tasty but MSG loaded.<br /><br />So if you're eating real amounts of jerky, give ANY of the Golden Valley jerky products a spin for a few weeks and you'll feel a night and day difference.  Also check out my other review for more.

review/text: This brand is properly cut across the grain, so it's fairly easy to eat, and the flavor is distributed through the cuts, rather than sprayed on. It made a pretty good stew meat after long cooking as well, though it had to be broken into small pieces to rehydrate.

review/text: The meat was poor quality. It was very chewy--not tender at all--and many pieces were gristly, so we'd wind up having to spit wads out since no matter how much you chewed, they'd never break up. The taste was okay, but a bit too sweet for our liking.

review/text: I didn't like this jerky at all.  I read other reviews and decided to try it.  However, the bag I received was very soft and sweet.  I realize that it's called "sweet" n' spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all.  The sweetness was overpowering.  I prefer at dryer jerky also.  This was so soft that you could bite right through it.  I'm used to jerky that is tougher.<br /><br />I know I'll never purchase this brand again.

review/text: I made a mistake on the other review, I mixed it up with a differnt brand.  I received a bag of this jerky today,  I have just ordered another package.<br />This is the best beef jerky that I have bought off the market  However, the Hi-Country brand from Montana is just as good, only that brand has preservatives.<br />This natural beef jerky, in my opinion, could not be made any better. This jerky has a sweet and a mild spicy flavor with the right amount of bite.<br />The beef has the right chewability.  I like this jerky so much, that it is hard to explain in a written review.  You have to know JERKY to concept,<br />what I am saying.  I would give this product and the company 10 stars if I could.  That should explain it. I ordered this jerky one day and received<br />it the next day.  Order yourself a package, then you will see what I mean.................

review/text: Like other reviewers on here, I was looking for beef jerky under $20/lb. I was also quite impressed by this product's claim that it lacks MSG, artificial flavorings, nitrates, and preservatives. I decided to give the sweet n' spicy variety a go, and I was quite impressed despite the lackluster reviews. The texture, I must admit, lacked consistency; some bites were tougher than others. Overall, however, the flavor tasted great and the quality of the beef was apparent. If you're looking for inexpensive, natural beef jerky, you can stop your hunt right here.

review/text: This jerky is the soft, chewy style.  Though it is listed as Sweet'N'Spicy, it's quite a bit more sweet than spicy.  I doubt even the most sensitive to spice would consider this spicy jerky.  It's tasty, it doesn't have any nitrites, MSG, high fructose corn syrup or anything else that's terrible for you.  It's also affordable.  The only reason it didn't get five stars is that it's not an outstanding and amazing, one-of-a-kind flavor worthy of five stars.

review/text: No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4ARBE">Sweet N' Spicy</a> flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again.

The instructions say "for best taste use within 3 days." It is good, it is tender, but again the down fall is keeping it in a refrigerator. You are better off going to your nearest Wal-mart or Target, etc. and pick up one of the brands they carry and forget about refrigerating and eating it in a hurry. I hope this helps some of you from ordering to much like I did, I order 2 lbs, and sorry I did.

We love our chili and people are passionate as to which sauces and salsas they prefer.

review/text: I have to say that these beans are as good as my mom's home made.  At first I wasn't sure how freeze dried beans would taste, no regrets.  These are the best I've had and I've had them all!  My recipe for them is:  I heat up the water, add a tablespoon of olive oil or maybe bacon drippings, then add ground cumin to taste, garlic powder to taste, chili powder to taste, and onion powder to taste.  Once it's all boiling I add the beans and mix until I get the consistency I like.  Take it from someone who grew up on Mexican food... these suckers are good! Don't skip the oil part because the oil carries the flavors better.  Also, no need for salt.<br />I don't get the southwestern because they have partially hydrogenated oil or something like that.

review/summary: another happy Santa Fe Bean Company's customer
review/text: I bought this product for backpacking and camping purpose and did get to try it the past weekend in Yosemite.<br /><br />Once it was cooked (I added some chicken stock powder, 1 minced Roma tomatoe, and 1 half head of minced red onion), it was creamy and tasty.  It was great to eat with grilled sausages and meats wrapped in tortilla flat bread.<br /><br />I can use half a cup of this product and half cup of TVP by Bob's Red Mill to make a healthy dinner when I backpack.  It can be a fast party bean dip mixed with pico de gallo and minced avocado.<br /><br />At home I saute chopped onion and add half a can of diced green chiles into the pot with the beans.  I also use chicken stock instead of water.  The result is FANTASTIC!  No need to add more salt because chicken stock and canned chile pack salt already.  I'd eat it with roasted chicken breast.  The drier white meat tastes super delicious eaten with the embelished black beans.<br /><br />It takes no time rehydrate, offers healthy calories, and is filling.  Every cupboard should have a bag or two of this product.

review/summary: So easy and so tasty!
review/text: These refried black beans are delicious, I could eat the whole bag in one sitting if I let myself. As a previous reviewer stated, these take 5 minutes to make. The package is resealable so you can make a small portion and save the rest for later. Unlike when you open a whole can, you don't have to eat it within about a week. I think the flavor is a lot better than canned beans as well. They taste salty to me but in a good way. I usually mix refried beans with salsa but with these I didn't have to, they are good on their own. The one thing I miss is a few occasional whole beans in the mix but there are some bigger chunks in the package (it's not like a puree). I felt silly buying dried beans in bulk but I will probably do it again and sample other Santa Fe products. Thumbs up!

There are two ingredients in these dehydrated beans and they are extra tasty with a little cheese or salsa stirred in while making. The package makes three meals worth for two people, but there is no instructions on the package for making less at one time. I just use a little under 2:1 water to beans and it turns out pretty good.

review/text: My husband and I have purchased Santa Fee vegetarian refried beans at the store, but we had never tried the black refried beans. All of a sudden the store we were purchasing the vegetarian refried beans from stop selling them. So my husband found them at amazon. com  and on amazon.com they offered two kinds of refried beans so we decided to try both the vegetarian & black refried beans and we are so glad we did because now the black refried beans are our favorite.

Great for a single burrito with rice, lettuce and guacamole, nice for bean dip, goes well with greek yogurt or sour cream.

We have bought numerous boxes and we actually include them in our emergency food storage.<br /><br />They are quick and easy to prepare, taste great, and are less expensive on Amazon then in the local grocier.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: I bought these on clearance at my local grocery store and fell in love. They still carry the pinto beans but no longer the black beans. I love the black beans to make a delish black bean soup or chili. All of the Sante Fe Beans are great to make dips with beacause you can alter the consistancy so much easier. I too have tried a ton of beans and prefer natural beans or dried. These are at the top of my list. I seriously can't say enough good things about these. They are super fast, great to take to work, hiking, anything. Also wanted to add that the fiber is higher in these than in most canned beans, which is a super bonus worth noting.

review/summary: As Good as Home-Made if not better.
review/text: I have been using these beans, refried and black beans for several years. The company split into two seperate companies but the products are virtually the same. My wife was born and raised in Mexico and she and her brothers and sisters have tried these beans and they thought they were home made. They are light years better than the terrible canned refried beans. I can recommend the fat-free beans becasue you cannot tell the difference between the fat-free and regualar.<br /><br />They could not be easier to make. You bring 2 1/4 cups water to a boil. (More or less water depending on whether you like your beans thicker or thinner).Dump entire package into boiling water and lower heat to a simmer. Cook for 5-7 minutes according to your preferred consistency. Serve. That's it. I can promise you that you will like these as much or more than home-made refried beans from any good Mexican restaurant.

Some time ago, Kraft finally relented and brought back the 'classic' Catalina after lots of negative commentary about its "New Taste" Catalina formula.<br /><br />My Previous Entry:<br />I purchased a bottle of 'new' Catalina dressing at our local supermarket to try it out.

review/text: Well, I hate to be the "Lone Ranger" here, but we actually like this dressing.  I had completely forsaken the old traditional Catalina because it contained high fructose corn syrup.  I was THRILLED to be able to buy Catalina again and not have to make my own (which while good, wasn't exactly the same).  What a drag when you eat taco salads as often as we do.  To be truthfully and brutally honest, I can't tell much difference between the old and the new.  I think there had been some "formula" changes down the road because in later years, the Catalina didn't taste the same as I remembered in my earlier days.  Sorry if this offends all of you bashers out there!  I was very pleased to be able to purchase this conveniently through the Amazon Subscribe and Save program.

review/text: The original Catalina is the only dressing I loved. I have carried it to restaurants who did not offer it! The new Catalina is so digusting I threw it away . (I offered to give it away but one taste and everyone said no thanks) I can only hope Kraft realizes they have made the same mistake as Coke did when they came out with New Coke. This dressing is not OK, it is horrible. I would only eat it if I were starving. I contacted Kraft and got the usual line. (taste tested, consumers like it, blah, blah) I cannot imagine anyone liking this. It tastes like vinegar and white pepper.If you loved the old Catalina PLEASE contact Kraft to let them know your feelings. It's our only hope. This is supposed to be healthier....well it can't be healthier if you can't stand to eat it. They could have extended the original line and given consumers a choice. Really I just cannot imagine that anyone at Kraft could think this is even palatable. Thinking of the taste makes me sick. Thinking about never having my favorite dressing again makes me furious.

The fact that they are sticking with it shows that it must be WAY cheaper to manufacture -and they are so arrogant - and think that they are so big-  that they can dictate to the consumer and not the other way around.

review/summary: Catalina "Classic" Is Back!
review/text: We just found "Classic Catalina" at Walmart!  Seems they realized their horrible mistake and brought the old formula back in August 2009.  I just got off the phone with them about this.  Get this - They say the only change is that they went back to artificial preservatives.  They said the change in taste is entirely due to the preservatives used.  What a bunch of bull.  Coke used the same kind of bogus explanation when they brought back "Classic Coke".  Hopefully Kraft has learned its lesson.  The babyfaced marketing MBA's at Kraft were probably still in pre-school when Coke screwed up.  Apparently this was not covered in their business classes.

review/summary: What a waste...
review/text: Once the most popular salad dressing in America Kraft's Catalina brand dressing, once an icon, is no more. From the fake red dyed color to the off and slightly spoiled, rotten smell this "new" version of America's favorite should be avoided. I am certain some 24 year old MBA probably got a nice promotion out of wringing a few cents of expense per bottle this receipe probably saves Kraft. Frankly, and thankfully, there are a number of receipes available that let you make a fine home made version of the original. Try those instead of this product.

review/summary: Vile & Nasty stuff!
review/text: Here is my rant on the "new" Kraft Catalina dressing. It is the vilest and nastiest stuff I've ever put in my mouth!!! I HATE it! I called to complain on their 800 number and the minimum-wage phone jerk told me how they put all their products under taste testing samples and market research. Well, those people they tested must not have any taste buds. Regardless, we don't have Catalina dressing anymore and I don't believe that Kraft is going to listen to us. While this decision is similar to the Coca-Cola disaster in 1985, it doesn't have the same economic impact that the Coke had. Millions of people don't consume Catalina every second of every day like Coke does, so while Kraft might notice some sales declines, I think their stubborn, marketing-minded mentality will keep the new product on the shelves. Too many corporations these days are more concerned with dollars and "new and improved" products than maintaining tried-and-true products with loyal customers. These corporations are being infiltrated with young college graduates who don't know, nor care, about value and time-honored traditions. For them, everything is about dumping the old simply because it's old and not relevant anymore. This is happening in all areas of our lives. Anyway, in my refund check from Kraft, they thanked me for being a loyal Kraft customer and looked forward to my continued support. They are so large that they don't have a clue as to what's going on. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing. I told that phone jerk that I was boycotting ALL products that Kraft makes. I am very angry that they messed with this dressing. I have found an alternative at Wal-Mart. They have their Great Value brand dressing in Honey French and Homestyle French flavors. The better of the two is the Honey French; however, if you combine the two dressings in equal amounts you have a nice tasting French dressing very similar to Catalina. Of course, if you go with the Honey French by itself, it is very similar to the Catalina taste. All that said, the old Catalina had the best balance of flavors and zinginess that I liked. It's so sad!

review/summary: The best chocolate I have ever experienced
review/text: My mother and I just had our own mini chocolate tasting party.  Each of the bars has its own distinct flavor, and we had a wonderful time identifying all of the different subtle flavors present in the chocolate bars -- Amano chocolate bars are rich, strong, chocolate.  Not too sweet and not too bitter.  The perfect dark chocolate. Worth every penny.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: I found Amano at a chocolate event, and they blew everything else out of the water.  It can be difficult to find single origin chocolate, but they have several options.  The processing is just right, the darks are dark and rich, not too sweet or bitter, and not overly filled with waxes and cocoa butter the way many others are.  The natural profiles of the chocolate shine through, gently supported by the minimal addition of sugar and vanilla.  My favorite is the Dos Rios, it's fruity with just a little spice, but earthy enough without being dirty or musky.  Because the chocolate is so rich I eat it very slowly--half a square is plenty in one sitting, and I usually only want it once or twice a week.  A bar is worth every cent, even when I find myself giving much of it away (because really, you have to try this...)

review/text: Amano chocolate is chocolate nirvana.  If I'm having a bad day, half of a square, slowly melted on my tongue, completely changes my paradigm.  I love chocolate.  I would even consider myself a chocolate connoisseur, and this is the best.  Hands down, no doubts, the best.  The flavors are subtle and delicious, and experiencing them is almost orgasmic. The hand care they take in selecting every nib, in determining the roast, in making it in small batches on old fashioned chocolate equipment shows in every bite. It's worth every cent.

review/summary: Really fine chocolate
review/text: I'm not a connoisseur (to call myself that, I feel I'd have to experience the width and breadth of what's out there, and I haven't done that, I really can't be bothered) however I've known for decades the difference between good chocolate and the junk they usually make in America. Once I'd enjoyed fine European chocolates, I had a hard time finding American made chocolate that I would particularly enjoy. I like a lot of the chocolates made by See's Candies, definitely. Guittard Gourmet Bittersweet (also American made) can be bought in bulk, and it's excellent bang for the buck. Not a top quality chocolate, but very decent, completely worth buying and I always have it on hand.<br /><br />The reviews here got me curious to try Amano, and I'm informed that they are an American made chocolate company dedicated to maintaining high quality over quantity production techniques. I've tried this sampler, and for me the Ocumare stands out head and shoulders above the others. It's truly exquisite. I'm going to get more for sure. Ocumare is currently not available here, I signed up for notification. Hopefully, when I do get more it will be as good as the bar I'm working on. What I've read suggests that batch to batch it could differ, maybe a lot, depending on the growing season, the quality of the particular cocoa bean crop.

review/summary: Hard to find Deli-Rye Triscuits now available on Amazon.com
review/text: I really enjoyed the Deli-rye Triscuits when they were offered in the Evansville, IN<br />market many years ago.  Unfortunately they no longer carry this product in our grocery<br />stores. On visiting a friend in Cincinnati, OH I discovered them on the shelves at a<br />Kroger store. Naturally I was elated with joy. I bought several boxes to take home.  This was the closest area that<br />I could find that carries them.<br /><br />  I did a search on the Internet for the Deli-rye Triscuits and to my surprise found<br />them available on Amazon.com. Now I don't have to drive four hours to get them.  Amazon.com can have them<br />delivered right to your front door.  They come 12 to a box so I can share them with<br />my friends and relatives. They can't wait until my shipment comes in.<br /><br />  The Deli-rye Triscuits have a great rye taste that makes for a great compliment to any<br />kind of spread or topping.  I like them with shaved ham and swiss cheese.  I also like to melt<br />Monterey Jack cheese on them for a hot snack. For a special treat, try them with smoked salmon, cream cheese, and<br />fresh dill.<br /><br />  Thanks Amazon.com for making them available so that everyone can enjoy them.<br />  Duane in Evansville, IN

review/text: The Napolitains are wonderful for people who enjoy chocolate on its own.  The pure chocolate pieces are great as an expression of high-quality chocolate.  People who enjoy the pleasant bitterness of pure cocoa will be especially impressed by the Sao Tome.  The flavored pieces stick with classic combinations and provide some nice variety and contrast.  The product descripton's suggestion of offering the assortment after dinner is good, especially with coffee. I find they are very nice to set out at parties or just for everyday guests, too.  It's so nice to just have a taste as I run out the door.  The best part is that none of these disappoint because they're all chocolate with no mystery fillings.<br /><br />Leonidas' packaging for shipping will protect the box and ensure it arrives safely.  You should get them in 3 days and eat them fresh, although the Napolitains store well, too.  They're best if enjoyed at room temperature.

review/text: The crunchy chocolate squares in this box were a real surprise and I love how delicate the crunch is when encased in a burst of delicious chocolate.<br /><br />You may also enjoy the Mint chocolates. They are delicious after dinner or anytime you want to wake up your taste buds. The mint flavor bursts from these chocolates as if it was encased in little sugar crystals. It is quite perfect and refreshing.<br /><br />I also love the Cinnamon and Orange. If you have been dreaming of the most delicious orange flavored chocolates in the world, you have to try the Orange Napolitains. I love both equally, although the cinnamon flavor has me completely seduced.<br /><br />I prefer to savor each piece of chocolate with a cup of coffee, tea or hot chocolate. The warmth of the beverage creates an entirely different experience than if you were to simply taste a square of chocolate on its own.<br /><br />Once your mouth is warmed, take a small bite of the chocolate square and enter Mint Chocolate Oblivion. The world stops for minutes at a time as you savor a mingling of the best cinnamon you have ever tasted with the silkiest creamiest Belgian chocolate in the world.<br /><br />My chocolates arrived fast and were as fresh as if I had purchased them in Belgium. They were carefully packaged in the famous gold boxes with signature wrapping and a ribbon. The boxes were then placed in protective Styrofoam containers to protect the chocolates during shipping. The expedited shipping is recommended from May to early September.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

The sampler box came inside of a foam container, which I assume they used to keep the temperature stable.<br />After taking the sampler box out of the foam container and opening it, my nose was greeted with the most heavenly scent of chocolates.<br />The box is divided into two compartments by a white cardboard sheet.  The bottom compartment is packed full of different chocolates, and the top compartment holds the rest in order to make it 1 pound.<br />I took all the chocolate out and organized them into flavors and was quite dissapointed that there weren't any Cinnamon flavored ones in my sampler.  That's the reason I gave this sampler only four stars.  I also got a whole bunch of Nibs, and barely any Dark, Milk, and White.<br />Nonetheless, the choclates are mighty tasty.  They seem very fresh.  My favorite so far is the 72% pure origin Sao Tome and the white chocolate.

review/text: Beautiful packaging, gorgeous little squares of chocolate, but disappointing texture and flavor.<br /><br />Leonidas did an amazing job packaging this little box of gold, there was no way the final gift package was going to be harmed in any way. The cloth ribbon and beautiful wrapping paper covered a wonderful gold cardboard box. Inside was arranged the prettiest little squares of chocolate. The romance ended after I ate this chocolate.<br /><br />The box contains a somewhat random assortment of seven different chocolates. Each piece of chocolate is six grams, and the box should contain exactly the same number of each variety. For reasons that are impossible to understand, there were only five orange and three Feuilletine chocolates; but over a dozen dark chocolates.<br /><br />Why I was disappointed with these chocolates - the flavor and texture.<br /><br />The nibs are dark 55% cocoa chocolate with little tiny bits of crunchy chocolate particles. The chocolate is slightly sweet, the texture is coarse, and it does not melt evenly. The nib particles seem like bits of coffee bean or sand in the chocolate - not a very pleasant texture.<br /><br />The Dark chocolate is also 55% cocoa but much lighter in color than the nibs. Several bars in my box had bloomed - the texture was extremely hard, melt was very slow and uneven in my mouth. Overall the flavor was not great. I love dark chocolate. These squares were just not to my liking at all.<br /><br />White chocolate is fabulous in the hands of expert chocolate makers. The version we are used to is almost all sugar and a really bad substitute. Great white chocolate is somewhat sweet, but typically has a very pure clean chocolate flavor and aroma; along with a smooth melt. This white chocolate should have been like the great version, instead it was exactly in the middle - a bit too sweet, and dull chocolate flavor. Fortunately, these seemed to be much fresher than the other chocolates in the box.<br /><br />Feuilletine is a 32% cocoa milk chocolate with bits of wafer in the square. The wafers contain gluten. The chocolate is too sweet and left an oily film on the roof of my mouth. The melt was uneven. The wafers were a distraction, not enough crunch like a Kit Kat, but just enough to annoy the melting and leave tiny crunchy bits in my mouth.<br /><br />Milk chocolate is 32% cocoa product. Like the Feuilletine, the chocolate is too sweet and left an oily film in my mouth. It also had a slightly bitter aftertaste.<br /><br />Orange is a mix of dark 55% cocoa chocolate with natural orange flavoring. The orange is subtle, not overpowering. But the base chocolate is just not a good example of particle size, texture, and flavor. It had the same problems as the nibs and dark squares.<br /><br />The best for the last, there was one decent chocolate in the whole box - Pure Origin Sao Tome - 72% cocoa. This variety is good, but does not rescue the rest of the box. At this cocoa level, the chocolate has to be really good; there isn't enough sugar to mask problems. Compared to some of the better high percentage cocoas, this is about the middle of the pack. Melt is pretty good, not perfectly even but not coarse. There is an initial good tart flavor that slowly goes away. The aftertaste is the biggest problem, a kind of dry powder and bitterness left in my mouth.<br /><br />The molding on all of these chocolates was not good. Every square had bubbles or imperfections on the back of the square. If the chocolate is the correct temperature at molding and tempered properly, the back of a bar will be perfectly smooth.<br /><br />I was truly expecting a box full of heaven from Leonidas, smooth, sweet, lovely chocolates that I could enjoy slowly. The packaging was beautiful; the contents were just not outstanding. Although not packaged as beautifully, but at the same price point I prefer Valrhona, Cote D'Or, Milka, Lindt, or imported Nestle.
