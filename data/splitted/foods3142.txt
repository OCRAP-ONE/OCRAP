review/summary: My cat's favorite
review/text: My cat is prone to Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease, and needed a good quality canned cat food to prevent blockages. Newman's was the first I tried, and he loves all of the flavors except the Beef and Beef and Liver.<br /><br />I recently tried to switch him to Wellness, which is grain-free, and smells much better. But instead of cleaning his plate like he does with Newman's, half the can of food was left untouched. So I'm now subscribing to Newman's because I think it's a great deal for organic cat food (which Wellness is not) even if it has grains. I guess my cat just likes grains!<br /><br />I recommend this food, but keep in mind that cats are finicky (well, most cats anyway). Buy one or two trial cans before committing to a 24-pack!

review/summary: 3 for chicken& brown rice- 0 for beef flavor
review/text: Both of my cats like the chicken & brown rice and Newman's dry food flavors which I buy when they are heavily discounted. Neither of them would touch the beef flavor I bought on a gold box special. It has a faded milky slightly greenish pale brown hue, not medium brown as one would expect and oddly not much of an odor (I know why complain about that, but my point is is should have some type of aroma or odor to it.) Because of the color I did not donate it or feed it to the strays as I think it may be a bad batch. The reason for the 3 stars is for chicken & rice is at the price point there are better organic cat food values that do not contain so much brown rice. I like Organix and By Nature ingredients and my cats do too. Sometimes I'll buy Natural Value or Natural Balance canned foods since they offer more variety of flavors.

review/summary: Good quality food, but Amazon's ingredient listing is incorrect
review/text: We have a cat with a liver problem who needs a low-purine diet.  As a result, we are trying to switch her off of her Wellness food and find poultry alternatives that do not contain any organ meat.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the site are accurate except that they exclude "chicken liver" as the second ingredient in the chicken and brown rice food and "turkey liver" as the second ingredient in the turkey and vegetable food.  Thus, I just bought two cases of food that will not meet my cat's needs at all!<br /><br />Other than that, it seems to be a high quality food.  It is a pate-style food with a meaty, but not unpleasant odor.  Cats ate it right away when offered.  Will be donating ours to the local animal shelter, where I am sure it will be loved!

No wated food left sticking to the sides to scrape out.

review/summary: Super high quality for the ones you love
review/text: Besides the fact that it's the only food my fussy bunch of four agree they like...there are other reasons why I love Newman's Own. Check the label.  The first, and most abundant ingredient is organic turkey.  In fact, ALL of the ingredients are organic.  When others pets were sadly dying from contaminated food connected to China, I could rest assured my cats were OK.  Again, check the label...Newman's Own meets the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO...a factor my vet cautioned me on when I went looking for a high quality food. Finally, I buy it because Paul & Nell Newman produce a great line of products.  If you want to treat yourself, pick up a package of Newman's Own Organic Cookies.  It doesn't matter if you go for the Newman O's or the Orange Chocolate Chip Cookies...they're all terrific.

review/summary: My cat wouldn't eat the beef
review/text: This is the first catfood I've had in a can that didn't smell strong of aromas when I opened it, and perhaps that is why the cat wouldn't eat it.  Catfood is notorious for having artificial aromas added to attract finicky cats.  This stuff is all organic and even when hungry, the cat just walked away from it.<br /><br />So the case I bought for the cat literally went to the dogs, who all gave this stuff two paws up.  The dogs saw the small cans as special treats and would woolf it down fast.

review/text: Great product.  Even my very picky kitty (has digestive problems)liked this flavor.  She always loves salmon-flavored wet food but not usually chicken-flavored wet food, so I was apprehensive about her reaction.  It took her a few days, but she got to like it (not love it).  It looks different from the wet food we're used to, but that's apparently due to the lack of artificial preservatives.  Also, I feel good about buying it since proceeds go to charity.

review/summary: Chicken and Salmon
review/text: My six month old kitty (Tinker) loves the Newman's Chicken and Salmon moist food. I was buying another commercial brand and even though he would eat some most would be left to dry up and most of the can was being wasted. So paying a little more for a quality organic diet and not a bunch of by-products is well worth it.  Plus the Newman's organic brand certifies that ingredients have been grown on farms that have not used artificial fertilizers or pesticides. I have bought two other flavors of the food but this one is his favorite.

review/summary: great high quality food
review/text: Pros: organic, grain free and a reputable company that gives back to the community<br />cons: my cats needed a few days to get used to this. yes the meat looks grey. but that is because it is all natural.<br />What I do is mix a 3 ounce can with half a can of Wellnes Beef and Chicken. (so its 3/4 meat and only 1/4 chicken) This seems to work. They love this combo. If I just give them the newman's, they eat but don't finish it. Out of all of the grain free beef canned cat foods, I've had the most success with this. My cats didn't like Nature's Variety Instinct or by nature organic. (Both great brands) But its really important to rotate protein sources so that my cats don't develop allergies (my six year old cat recently developed a seafood allergy after only eating seafood for 5 years...) so I push the beef on them.<br />Give it a shot. It might take some work or creativity but eventually you should win. Both my cats are v finicky and I found a way to make it work. Organic beef! I don't even eat organic beef all the time! LOL! ITs a bit pricey but its worth it. Healthy food = healthy cats=longer life=less disease/health problems.

review/summary: Cat won't eat it
review/text: I feel really bad writing this review since I am a big fan of the Newman's Own brand for human food. Their salad dressings are amazing. However, my cat would not eat this product. I purchased the beef flavor because she loves her beef flavored cat treats. I give her organic dry food most of the time, but after talking to some other cat owners, they informed me that I should be mixing some wet food into her diet because wild cats get most of their moisture from their food in nature and don't drink a lot of water. I thought it couldn't hurt to give this to the cat as a treat a couple times a week, but she won't even touch it. I tried mixing her regular dry food into it to give it some texture, and she just ate the dry food around it. I am not sure if this is just a textual preference for my cat or if it is this particular cat food.

review/summary: The best
review/text: I have tried every "good" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.  YYYEEEEAAAHHHH!

review/summary: Great food, Great price, and no more food allergies!!!
review/text: My cat had the worst food allergies. The way she dealt with it was by vomiting on an almost daily basis. Getting special foods (i.e. Science Diet or Purina from the veterinarian) didn't help at all. Finally I tried Newman's Own dry food figuring it couldn't be any worse. It worked like a miracle! No more allergies and no more carpet cleaning except the occasional hairball. When my cat got older I started supplementing her dry food with the Newman's Own wet food and she loves it. She's been eating this for several years, same flavor and everything, and she still comes running when she hears the food being prepped. If you want a healthy pet don't look any further than this! It's organic and there isn't a single ingredient that I can't pronounce. That's definitely something I want when I'm feeding my cat.<br /><br />The price through Amazon.com is cheaper than buying in the stores and the cans come well packaged and undamaged. I won't be going to the store for this again. Thanks Amazon!

review/summary: the proof in truly in the pudding (Newman's Own- Chriken formula)
review/text: "Only my hair dresser knows for sure,"  Well I don't know about that, but the folks at Amazon know how much cat food I order (on account), both dry & wet foods.  Before I even offered Newman's Own Organic Chicken & Brown Rice formula to my five cats, I could see the difference.  Upon openind the first can, I was so pleased to see real chicken broth (organic of course). It was clear broth just like boiling chicken on stove top. It was really fresh looking too., So then the real test when offering to the three indoor cats.  All three approved.  I given only small portions at one time, yet my kitties cleaned the bowl, eating right up!  Never, ever do I recall when my kitties have been so accepting of their wet food. I've owned and cared for cats for over 25 years, and this food really impresses me! I now order it via "Subscribe & Save" (Amazon program) and it will be delivered at regular intervals.  The first case was damaged in shipment (3 or 4 cans were damaged so bad that the contents were running and dripping from the carton. I contacted Amazon and they were gracious as usual and are sending a new case for my accomodation. The only concern I have at this time is that this particular formula is "out of stock" and currently not available from Amazon, though it can be purchased from WAG.com.  I also make purchases from WAG.com and though their prices are slightly higher (most of the time), they are also a great company and have a good variety of foods for both Cats & Dogs, as well as other pet items.<br /><br />If you've never read Newman's Own QA report and product description, be sure to do so. I think you'll be impressed. I was.

review/text: I have been feeding my cats dry food that is supposed to be minimally processed. I have found that they have been much healthier. Recently I took in my moms cats that are geriatric. I was looking for something minus all the by product and fillers that was a soft food for them. Newmans seemed to be it but at Wal-Mart it was 1.35 a can. I was able to get it here for about 1.00 a can with free shipping with Prime which made a small savings buying by the 24. The cats like it and as I have found with the other dry food they tend to eat less and go longer between feedings before they get hungry again. I am happy with the product and will definately continue to buy in the future.

review/summary: Why the fillers and guar gum? Sigh
review/text: Unfortunately, I can't afford a raw food diet for my cats and they want nothing to do with Felidae, the only affordable truly healthy food that has an ingredients list that makes me feel comfortable. My cats love both turkey formulas of Newman's brand. I always have dry food available which they like but they become vocal to be feed this stuff, they are Siamese so I must do their bidding or the racket doesn't end. I always smell the open product and for six months now, no irregular smells or coloring.<br /><br />Concerns are the fillers that I see in the ingredients, brown rice and oat bran are better than wheat and corn I agree, but it still irks me that a company makes such a commitment to be organic and then uses fillers. Also, Guar Gum makes me a little nervous, though guar gum is one of those fibers that are everywhere, it is basically a thickening agent (think cornstarch) and like any fiber it has its positives along with its negatives. A plus for this brand is that its carried in my local supermarket which is very practical and the price I find reasonable for an organic brand.<br /><br />Since I don't want them to become dependent on any single brand I also feed them Natural Life (same filler issues) which they like but don't love as much as Newman's Turkey flavors. To balance my concern that perhaps there are too many carbs in their diet, I insure that the dry food I purchase is low in carbs such as Before Grain dry food.

It's a fabulous idea and saves running to the bodega in the scary 'hood at midnight when I realize that my princely master (I have learned that the adage -- 'people have dogs and cats have people' is all-too-true, though I am struggling to remain in charge) is out of food. I also seem to really love parenthetical asides, but that's beside the point.<br /><br />Anywho,(here's *that* thing) when I received my first shipment and realized that this was far more than my cat (this is my first cat, a stray whom I had no choice but to take in -- so I am new at cat-ism, previously being a dog person) would eat in a month, I immediately logged in to change the frequency and/or amount of the auto-ship order and it seems my only option is to cancel. This is pesky and bothersome because that leaves me with two choices, as I see it; cancel the auto-ship, or, let the cat food pile up till I have enough cat food to last a year and then cancel. So I give the product 5 stars because my finicky little Prince Wonderfluff loves it and it is healthy and free of the chemicals which are all-too-present in food in this country, but I think Amazon needs to fix the auto-ship options so that when you click on the impending subsequent shipment, you can make such changes to frequency and amount. There may be an existing way to do this but I can't figure it out and I make web sites for a living so I can generally figure out how to do such things.<br /><br />I suppose a third option is to contact Amazon Customer Service but that's not a quick and easy task and I am busy trying to maintain order and earn a living.

review/text: Nice to know my 15 year old cat is eating healthy organic food (and has done for years) AND he is crazy about the taste. He is very picky and wont even touch the other flavours. But we found this one, and he has been crazy about it for years! Why though is there a limit on how many times you can buy this? :/

review/summary: one cat loves it, the other...not so much
review/text: I bought this as a gold-box deal, so I got a good price for this cat food; I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise, since it's a tad bit on the expensive side. I try to buy healthier food for my cats. Since they both liked the liver and beef food from science diet, I figured they'd like this too. It turns out that only one of my cats like it, but the other won't touch it. I'm glad that at least one of them will eat it, otherwise, this would've been a waste of money. Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.

review/summary: Kitty approved
review/text: I have a senior cat (18 years old) and her teeth are not in great shape.  I switched her to an all wet food diet about 2 years ago, and Newman's is the best wet food that I've found on the market.  She is also fairly finicky, and LOVES the Chicken and Brown Rice formula.  I've tried a lot of other high-end cat foods, some more costly than Newman's, and several of them she has had problems digesting.  Not Newman's!  She really seems to enjoy this food and I don't have to worry that it is upsetting to her delicate stomach.  I've also found that it doesn't have that stench that some other wet cat foods seem to have.  The food is a lot cheaper here on Amazon than in my local store.  Shipping and delivery was fast and pain-free, the box was well packed and none of the cans were dented.  I highly recommend this product.

review/text: Following a year with my adopted 8 year old Persian mix and his incredibly loose stool, three weeks after adding Mr. Newman's to his diet he has a firm stool. We tried Science Diet IM and WD a combination of wet  and dry.  I continue to  feed him the WD dry with a 1/3 of a can Newman's twice a day. Not that this cat is a picky eater but he cleans the bowl with Newmans and he always left a bit behind with ID. My cat is happier and I am  so happy that his obligatory butt cleaning scoots have ended.

review/summary: all three cats love it
review/text: My cats think this food is the cat's meow.  I think that cats who have been fed grocery-store-type foods that have added ingredients, some completely artificial, might need some time to adjust to the natural taste.  But my cats have only been fed higher quality food--most recently before trying Newman's Own they were exclusively eating Doctors Foster and Smith foods.  Even though Foster's is completely natural, it is not organic which is why I've switched.  It's a good feeling to know that I'm doing everything I can to give my cats health and long lives (my Siamese is 21).

review/text: We have 6 cats and 2 dogs presently and they all get Newman's Own Organics.  The only one we have had our cats walk away from is the 3 oz can of Turkey Formula for cats.  They love the 5.5 oz. can of Turkey and the other two selections.  They also love the 3 oz. chicken and salmon.  The only difference besides the size of the cans is that in the middle of the turkey formula 3 oz. cans there is now a dark pink or reddish colored spot(that was not there originally) that is not in the 5.5 oz can.  All the other dry and can food varieties are very nutritious and are eaten very quickly.

review/text: I ordered this product knowing that my cat loves Newman's Organic Turkey formula.  However, he refuses to eat it, and I am concerned that there is something wrong with this batch. I have offered it to him over a several week period thinking he would change his mind, but no luck.  I usualy have good luck ordering from Amazon, but this time I am totally frustrated not being able to speak to anyone.  I would donate the case to an animal shelter, but I am afraid that it could hurt the animals.  You see....I unknowingly fed another pet bad canned food a number of years ago, and there was eventually a recall.  Later she had health problems, and I believe it damaged her kidneys.  It was, in fact, a high quality pet food, so one never knows.

review/summary: Newman's Own
review/text: My cat eats well and has good digestion.  Last spirng I switched her from Science Diet to Orijen, which had been recommended to me by the owner of one of those fancy pet stores in downtown LA.  He said the it was low in carbohidrates and all natural. Within months she began bleeding.  I took her to the vet who recommended that I start feeding her plain canned turkey cat food until they could find out what was going on, which I did.  That episode costs me $600.00.  After a course of antibiotics I went back to Orijen and she immediately started bleeding again so I threw the Orijen out.  I started with Newman's Own six months ago and have never looked back.  My cat is happy with the food and there is no sign of blood anywhere.  I recommend Newman's Own.

review/text: The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.

When we opened this new one from Amazon, it didn't smell the same as the last batch, this one smelled like rotten fish and the last one smelled good. We have tried to give this new one to our cat and he refused to eat it (when he would beg for the other one and finish it promptly). I inspected both a can from this new batch and a can from the old batch and everything is the same including all ingredients. The only difference I could find was the older batch had a 2014 date on the bottom printed a little differently from the 2015 best by date the the new one....? I don't understand why this product has such inconsistent quality or maybe Newman's is not making the same quality product as they used to. Too bad since I would like to find a organic cat food that is not super expensive cause I'm not going to buy this one again.

review/summary: I wish this worked with our little darlings!
review/text: I do all the research before buying pet food.  I had high hopes that this one would work with out kibble eating cats as one of them needed to eat food containing more moisture as well as healthy ingredients.  When I opened the first can it smelled and looked good.  I was confident our cats would scarf it up and beg for more.  No way.  They made dainty little burying movements and then walked away.  All I could think of was how much I had spent for such puny results.  Now we are back to using the top grade of kibble and Fancy Feast, which our cats will eat.  However, the good news is that everyone we gave some to from the first case reported back that their cats loved it and they were going to keep using it.  Fancy Feast is cheaper so that is good, but I have no idea what is in the product.  I just trust that our cats are getting enough moisture.  I do regret that we are not using  Newman's Own product since I like their philosophy.

review/summary: Almost a 5
review/text: I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.

You can see bits of the ingredients (rice?) in the food, and the texture is not too firm, but certainly more firm than a pate-style food. I have already ordered my second case, and plan to order more in the future. These 5.5 oz cans fit the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000084E66">Petmate Kitty-Kap Can Cover</a> quite well.

review/text: I purchased the Chicken & Salmon formula with the notion that- Hey! I watch what I eat, My kitty should too! Needless to say, my cat Mia was less than thrilled. In fact, she took two wiffs and walked away :( Granted I was feeding her Fancy Feast before- which I recently found out is like feeding your cat Mcdonald's every day! Super tasty but void of any nutritional benefits whats-soever... So after a few unsuccessful meal times, I tried spiking her meal with a dash of Fancy Feast? No dice. She ate the Fancy Feast and I swear gave me this look like- 'Nice Try Bucco- and you thought you were SOOO sneaky...'<br /><br />So to the previous Fancy Feast feeders- I say maybe try something else to slowly get your cat onto the health track? Or you might end up like me with 20 cans of food I can't use :( I've been trying other brands that have more gravy- with slightly more success! (Emphasis on the slightly-she drinks up all the liquid and I'm left with chicken strips!) Maybe I have a oober picky cat? But I'm thinking I will keep on trying and probably give this one another run once I've detoxed her from her fast food craves..

The kitties love it and their hairless ape of a dad loves it to... loves to watch them love it, I don't eat it myself... not yet.

review/summary: Best Choice for my Cats
review/text: I tried literally everything, from high end to low end, before settling on Newman's Own.  The reason?  All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.

review/summary: Super Finicky Cat Loves It!
review/text: This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.

review/summary: Good product, great deal!
review/text: Product Basics: My cat loves this stuff, although I only serve it once a week.  It's fairly consistent from can to can; to date, I've only opened one can that was "watery"-ish.  The texture is usually very thick and solid.<br /><br />Product Received, including Packaging & Delivery: Since a case will last several months, I was pleased to see the expiration date was well in the future.  The product arrived in a small box, packed with airbags to protect the item - not glamorous, but efficient.  The box was slightly dinged on one corner; one of the airbags had broken from the impact, but the product was protected.  No cans were damaged.  Delivery was quicker than I anticipated (took about a week).<br /><br />Amazon Experience: Amazon makes it easy to order this stuff; I've even arranged for automatic shipping (you can speed up or delay the next shipment, if you're worried about timing).  This is the best price I've found for this product.  Overall, I would buy this product from Amazon, again.

review/summary: Totally disgusting!
review/text: I went back and forth on getting my girls some of the beef flavored Newmans because 2 of the 3 can't eat chicken.  I am always looking for a good quality food to add to their rotation.  There was a pretty good sale on the beef flavored a few days ago so I bought it.  I opened a can to give them for their dinner and I absolutely could not give that to my girls!  It had an awful grey color to it and was the consistency of wall paper paste.  My cats like to chew their food not lick it up so I knew they would have an awful time with this one.  Newman's has changed.  I have tried most of the flavors over the years and I have noticed that the cans are underweight and seem to have almost as much rice as pate in them.  Will not be buying again but thank heaven for Amazon that always makes it right without any hassles.

review/summary: Not their best
review/text: This particular blend isn't the best that Douwe Egbert's has to offer, though it certainly isn't bad. To me, it tastes a bit bland and without any of the delicious flavors usually associated with their coffee. It isn't.bitter though, and doesn't taste bad, per se, it just doesn't taste particularly good. Everyones taste is and preferences are different though, so while it doesn't taste good to me, it could be the best cup of coffee for you. You can't really go wrong with this brand though, their standards are quite high.

review/summary: Festival doesn't tell us what they mean by "Fresh Pack"
review/text: Your guess is as good as mine regarding what Festival means when they claim that their canned shiitake slices are "Fresh Pack."  On a separate subject:  Unlike MW Polar brand of canned sliced shiitake, Festival brand does not add sesame oil, which would make the mushrooms taste better but at the expense of adding unwanted calories from the "bad" polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (omega-6), which is the only kind of polyunsaturated fat contained in sesame oil.

review/text: This is a very full flavored coconut black tea, and it's VERY coconut-y!  You can even see chunks of the coconut in the tea.<br /><br />This makes a very decent cup of hot tea, although I thought it benefitted from some sweetening.  It packs a little too much coconut flavor for my tastes...I was hoping for something a little more subtle.  As an iced tea, I found this to be almost undrinkable...it's amazing how different hot teas are vs. cold.  The coconut aftertaste was overpowering and not pleasant.<br /><br />If you really love coconut and are looking for hot teas, then this is worth a try.

review/summary: Discovered these, unfortunately in their decline
review/text: These are about the closest thing many have found to the Carnation breakfast bar of the 70s, 80s and, I believe, the early 90s.  That classic Carnation bar (particularly the chocolate chip variety) had a flavor and consistency unmatched by any snack around.  The old "you can't eat just one" cliche was true for many, and these things were pretty substantial.  Thousands have signed a petition to get them back, but it's unlikely to do any good.  Anyway, back to the Quaker Chewy Dipps chocolate chip variety - they're a better substitute than most, but on their way down in quality.  The chocolate chips have become nearly non-existent, and I just noticed the "chocolatey" covered granola bar designation.  "Chocolatey" is a term food companies use when they want to consumers to believe a product contains genuine chocolate, when it actually does not.  They're still pretty tasty, but with more and more corners being cut (yes, I know chocolate is becoming more scarce and expensive), they are probably on the way out.

review/summary: Quaker Dipps taste great, but other factors reduce the rating
review/text: Quaker Chewy Dipps peanut butter bars are a tasty snack that is sure to satisfy anyone who loves the flavors of granola and chocolate. This snack food product takes an ordinary granola bar and coats it with a layer of milk chocolate to create a snack that is more chocolaty and sweeter than the average granola bar.<br /><br />I eat granola bars almost every day and Quaker Dipps are certainly high- ranking in the taste department. Granola with added milk chocolate- who wouldn't love such a combination? However, as much as I love the taste of Quaker Chew Dipps, I cannot overlook some of the negative qualities of these granola bars. First, there are some questionable ingredients such as high fructose corn syrup, cottonseed oil, artificial colors, etc. Other granola bar brands and flavors contain similar less- than- healthy ingredients, but their lists are not as long as the list for Quaker Chew Dipps. The ingredient list for this product includes multiple lines, which cannot be a good thing. Second, these granola bars are quite small. Other granola bars are larger and/or chewier and take more time to eat. These bars are only slightly chewy and their small size makes them disappear in seconds.<br /><br />The added milk chocolate on a Quaker Dipps bar makes them seem like candy bars. And compared to a candy bar, Quaker Chewy Dipps are certainly better. They do contain some wholesome ingredients and actually make a good choice when you have a sweet craving and need a fix. There are many questionable ingredients and the nutritional content is nothing to brag about, but at least you get a little bit of nutritional value and it is still better than that of most candy bars.<br /><br />Granola is a favorite snack food and Quaker Chewy Dipps are a good tasting snack that rate highly based on taste but much lower based on ingredients, nutrition, size, and other factors. I consider them an average snack overall and while I certainly won't turn one away, they include enough negative qualities that I don't seek these out when I shop. They taste great, but the negative qualities mentioned above are enough to make them average overall.

review/summary: Shipped Fast! Bought as Gift for Family Bereavement
review/text: One family I know has had a very stressful time of it, loosing a loved one last year, and having another loved one pass away at the same time another family member was getting married earlier this week.<br /><br />Having looked over flower arrangements at various florist websites online, I realized there'd still be flowers from the wedding, and frankly too many flowers after a death in the family can become overwhelming. For roughly the same price as a sympathy floral arrangement, this living sweet bay tree can be planted in a pot for the porch or deck and will provide a lasting memory of "Grammy".<br /><br />I ordered the plant yesterday, and received notice that it shipped this morning! How nice it will be for the family to plant it in honor of someone dearly loved. For those who aren't aware, Bay Laurel (sweet bay) is a symbol of strength and endurance.<br /><br />Update on April 27, 2012: The family planted this in a large pot on their deck, and it has now doubled in size from when it arrived. They live on the VA coast, and simply moved the pot closer to the house during cold weather nights. It's thrived outdoors in their mild climate and they're very, very happy with it.

review/summary: Wonderful!!
review/text: I'm usually a very skeptical person who tends to assume that when a seller has such rave reviews, it might be their employees shilling or something like that, so I wasn't expecting much when I ordered my plant. Boy was I surprised!!<br /><br />Not only the plant is wonderful, but it was the BEST packaging I've ever seen for a plant, ever. It was so perfect that when I pulled it out of the box, it looked as happy and refreshed as a plant that you just picked up at a nursery, and not at all like a plant that has spent time traveling in the mail.<br /><br />I've bought plants shipped by other places before, and they usually arrive in a variety of miserable states, but this plant looked like it had just been in its pot in my garden all this time, and not traveling around. I was amazed! No messy soil everywhere, no broken branches, no crushed leaves, not a single harm to the plant. Everything was perfect, and that was only possible thanks to their awesome packaging.<br /><br />It's also delicious! I have it sitting by the window in my kitchen, and have already made three different dishes using the leaves. :)<br /><br />I'll happily order more plants from them, if they're all of such quality and shipped as well!!

When I was a kid living in Grand Junction, Colorado (the home also of Enstrem's) my parents used to get a box of this every year at Christmas.  Needless to say the box would not last very long.  This is thick, rich, and buttery toffee at its finest.  Whole almonds inside this delicious toffee make for the excellent crunch and the crushed almonds and milk chocolate on the top is beyond yummy!  After you eat this awesomeness, there is the crushed almonds, bits of the toffee and chocolate, at the bottom of the box.  You literally have to shake the box of these delicious crumbs in your mouth!  Enstrems has become world famous not only for their toffee but for their chocolate, hard candy, and so much other delicious candy.  They have shops in Colorado from Grand Junciton to Colorado Springs.  It is now easy to order Enstrem's off the internet and their website is outstanding!  I order at least a pound of this delicious toffee every Christmas and have to be careful not to order it every month of the year!  But, I just torture myself and wait to Christmas to order this.  I can't recommend this delicious candy enough!  5 stars and more!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED DELICIOUSNESS!

review/summary: Eat this and you will find God
review/text: I remember about 30+ years ago my brother in law (then my sister's boyfriend) came home from a trip with his folks. He brought over a 3 lb box of this funny looking, broken up bits of chocolate-covered something, dusted in powdered sugar and crushed almonds. I grabbed a small piece and popped it in my mouth. At that point and time I heard the sound of singing angels, cherubs buzzed around my head and I was transported to a large golden gate that opened before me. Behind it was a beautiful old man with a long white beard who stood there with his arms folded and a smirk on his face.<br /><br />"Well," he said, "whudja think?"<br /><br />"Decadent," I said.<br /><br />He laughed, "yeah, I know."

review/text: About half this box of toffee had such a burnt flavor it had to be thrown out.  Very disappointing.  I cannot recommend this product.

review/summary: Best canned fish ever
review/text: I was a little surprised to find myself buying canned fish on Amazon. And now I'm even more surprised to find myself inspired to write a review of it. But this fish is so good I can't help myself. Hands down, Bar Harbor has the highest quality canned fish I've ever had, and it's also the least expensive. What a find! I've had the Smoked Kippers, the Herring in Mustard, and the Smoked Mackerel: all stellar. I expect to be ordering these again and again. My only wish for the Mustard variety is that it were more mustardy. It's called "Stone Ground mustard," which I usually associate with a mustard that is strong with a coarse texture. This is a thin, lightly-flavored mustard sauce. Good, but could be better, IMO. Still, with fish this good, 5 stars!

review/summary: A nice, mild fish -- beware of freezing
review/text: I like my canned fish with a bit of spice, and mustard sounded like it would fit the bill.  The only reason this product did not get five stars is because my box arrived frozen.<br /><br />When the cans of herring are frozen, the mustard separates into a sad mess of watery fluid and lumpy yellow mustard bits.  Stirring doesn't seem to reconstitute the sauce in a satisfactory fashion.  I've had to resort to scraping the mustard off and adding my own spices to the fish.<br /><br />Otherwise, a very nice fish.  A good, mild, flavor and a great change from tinned sardines.  These are hefty cans, about double the size of a sardine can, with enough fish in them for two people (or one very hearty eater).  Herring and sardines typically contain very little mercury while being high in essential fatty acids, which makes them good for regular eating.<br /><br />I'm saddened that I have not been able to try Bar Harbor's mustard sauce in its intended form.  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered the herring in December!

review/summary: I like these fishies
review/text: Great for a snack or meal on the go.<br /><br />The stone ground mustard is good with the herrings fillets; however, its mild, so I think most people can eat them fine.<br /><br />I like my mustard very vinergry/mustardy/spice, so I tend to add spicey dill mustards. These fish shouldn't be blended with salad, but are good in a sandwich or on their own.

review/text: The stone ground mustard really compliments the taste of the herring well. It's worth the extra few bucks to try this flavor at least once.

review/summary: California garlic
review/text: It is almost impossible to find garlic that doesn't come from China. I did a lot of research to find California garlic. When you open the container the aroma hits you immediately. You will be pleasantly surprised in the difference in quality. Whenever i am looking for something I go to Amazon for the best price and convenience.

review/summary: Happy to get granulated garlic grown in U.S.A.!!!
review/text: Very good product.  So glad to get garlic grown in U.S.A.  Even in Gilroy, California, which I thought was the garlic-growing capital of the world, they now sell (fresh) garlic grown in China.  Hard to believe, but true.  Whatever garlic powder you're buying off the supermarket shelf is also probably grown in China.

review/summary: Great stuff - much better than Chinese crud
review/text: 95% of the garlic powder out there is made in China, which I wouldn't feed to a dog because I don't condone cannibalism.  However, this garlic powder is fantastic - tastes far better than the chinese stuff and the price isn't bad either.  Great buy!

review/summary: Green Tea, Yet Not Green Tea Too--Different!
review/text: *****<br />I have tasted lots and lots of green teas, and this Gen Mai Cha is so different from any other one I've ever tried! It says on the package that it is nutty and savory and smooth---this is all true. I would add that it has a flavor that does indeed taste like toasted rice, and feels like a "comfort food" too---just so unique and yummy! It looks just like regular tea, and you can't discern anything that is rice-like about it, except in the taste. The package says that it is a "medium caffeine" tea.<br /><br />The only ingredients in this tea are organic Sencha Green tea and toasted rice, but the flavors are complex and interesting and exotic. I have only had a few cups but I can tell that I will order this tea again and again.<br /><br />This is worth a try for everyone really, for those like me who love green tea, or for those who don't like it and would like to try something different.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****
