review/summary: Good But No Great
review/text: I purchased this product because of some of my southern friends advice. I used the first quart in many different dishes and they were all good but I did not think it was any better then the Hellmann's I've used for years. The use by date was very good and that was important because of the quantity I purchased. I did save on the overall cost by purchasing 4 quarts and did receive free shipping which was fast as always with Amazon. Would I purchase this product again? Yes but only if I was planning on using a lot of mayonnaise which I rarely do. Overall I would say it's a very good product but so is what I usually buy.

review/summary: maui I love,your coffee a winner
review/text: Maui Coffee Co. 20% blend Maui Chocolate Macadamia nut coffee rates 5 stars as the coffee is mellow without being bland;that chocolately nutty flavor literally is like icing on cake.  In this case not too sweet like some of its competion but rich and mature and certainly full flavored.  This compares favourably with some of the nice Kona flavored blends.  Some would classify this as dessert coffee but I sip this coffee both AM or PM.  This coffee is not bitter at all, even after several hours after brewing.  This shocked me because after an hour most coffee needs to go down the drain.  The price at Amazon is also very smooth.

review/summary: pretty good flavor balance, nice chewy texture, could have more licorice flavor
review/text: I like these a lot. They are only slightly salty, with a bit of molasses sweetness, balanced against a mild licorice flavor. They are medium-hard and very chewy, although they must be kept in an airtight container or they get too hard. Personally I would prefer a stronger licorice flavor, but these are still among my favorites.<br /><br />Salty licorice is indeed a strange thing for those who haven't tried it before. If you've never had it before, don't start with a case (like what's sold here). And definitely stay away from Double Salt licorice until you've learned whether you like the saltiness.<br /><br />If you want black licorice but don't want the salty flavor, try "Haribo licorice wheels". Those have more licorice flavor than these coins, and less other flavor. They're a bit sweet and a bit softer.<br /><br />Note that these coins also come in plastic containers. Buying them that way is slightly less cost-effective, but the little tubs might be a little more airtight.

review/summary: Very stale but normally excellent real Licorice
review/text: This licorice is excellent.  This licorice is not soft.  It takes some time to chew through it.  You get "bursts" of pure licorice flavoring the whole time.  It is very satisfying.  If you love real licorice, you will love this one.  HOWEVER, THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING IT FROM AMAZON!  I bought two boxes - 24 packages - they were very stale which made them dry and exceptionally hard, almost brittle.  I think they must have been warehoused too long.  The packages do not contain a sell by date.  I know the difference because I buy the exact same product locally and it is softer and much better.

review/summary: Don't get if you have a sensitive nose!
review/text: I love licorice, and figured these would be good.  They are--the texture is right, the saltiness and sweetness were right on.  However, when you eat these, you get a very strong ammonia smell in your nose, due to the ammonium chloride.  I wish they would salt them with something else, because this smell is a bit overwhelming, and makes the product a little unpleasant.  It makes me wonder, too, how healthy it is to be consuming something that has an obvious amount of ammonia in it...If ammonia doesn't bother you, then I would recommend these on initial flavor and texture.

review/summary: Gustaf's Licorice Coins
review/text: These coins are just as great as the licorice cats.  The coins are a bit saltier and the texture may even be a bit smoother than that of the cats.  I purchased both, the cats and coins, and can compare them side by side.  Both will be my work companions for a long time.  This style of licorice is unlike the American type of licorice with an intense licorice flavor that can be eaten almost like hard candy. The saltiness mingles wonderfully with the sweetness. If you ever had European style licorice and fell in love with it - this product is it!  Great, fast shipping, too!

review/summary: Not the taste I was looking for
review/text: If you have never had these before they do not taste like twizzlers or good and plenty.  They are a bit salty and seem to be an acquired taste.  I've enjoyed this brand before.  I usually get different shapes like penguins or seals.  I thought the shape is not a big deal it is just what was available locally. Now I guess the shapes do count because I just do not find the "coins" to have enough licorice flavor.  They are not overly salty or anything just less flavorful then the other shapes I've had.  Even though the price is low, remeber you are getting a huge amount of licorice.

Still have some of the Season left and eat them merely as a health food, like nasty medicine so good for you.  But eat after slathering with a tablespoon of barbecue sauce, and maybe good cornchips on the side.

review/summary: A terrific staple pantry item and in my hurricane preparation kit
review/text: I really like that we can buy organic canned white meat chicken. This is one of my pantry staples (to add to soups, to make chicken salad sandwiches, to dump on top of salads for protein.) Living in South Florida, this is also part of my hurricane prep--ready to eat, lowfat, organic protein, easy as opening a can.<br /><br />For those of us too lazy to cook our own chicken for lunch, this is a great help.<br /><br />And for those who can't eat tuna (like me, due to seafood allergy), mixing this with traditional tuna fish salad ingredients (relish, mayo, onions, carrots, celery) almost feels like I'm having tuna like in ye olde non-allergic days. :)<br /><br />I tend to rinse this with water before using due to the saltiness.<br /><br />I'm glad amazon has it, as my local supermarket sometimes runs out. The expiration date on my last two orders here were in late 2011 for the first and mid 2012 for the second, so these are not "ready to go bad any day" type of sale items.

review/text: O.K.  I must first admit I haven't purchased this item - I almost did and was about to click to order then I did the math.  Even at the lowest price with Subscribe and Save it works out to .38 cents an ounce x 16 ounces = $6.08 per pound.  Now we all know even the best quality canned chicken is nowhere near a good tasting as a freshly roasted chicken.  My local supermarket sell Full Circle Organic Whole Chicken costs $3.00 a pound.  It is so easy to put a whole chicken in a baking pan and roast it for 40 minutes.  Plus you can boil down the bones for soup stock and get more value out of it with bone broth - very nutrient dense and great tasting - good for your bones if you eat the yummy warm gelatin broth.<br /><br />So just consider this a consumer advisory.  I couldn't find anywhere in the product info what agencies certifies this as "organic".  I have been eating organic food 100% of my diet since 1969 and I never heard of Valley Fresh brand.<br /><br />If I have my choice of paying $6.08 a pound for chicken in a can which sat in a warehouse for how knows long and $3.00 a pound for a fresh roasting chicken to make homemade chicken, I'll choose homemade anytime.<br /><br />BTW - Subscribe and Save on Amazon has terrific deals for organic food.  Especially on hemp foods and Nutiva and Nativa brand which is very expensive in natural food store but low priced on Amazon Subscribe and Save.

My 15 year old Cornish Rex has been on it for three weeks and her insulin has been reduced by almost half. The vet is extremely pleased and has OK'ed me switching from the Royal Canin diabetic chow to this great cat food.<br /><br />Her energy is way up (she's a Rex, so that's really saying something), her curly-furred coat is thicker and more lustrous, and her eyes have cleared up (leaving me wondering whether she had developed a sensitivity to the grains used in the dry Royal Canin chow).<br /><br />Usuri recommends this food highly! Especially at o'dark-thirty in the morning when she begins pestering me to give her some.

review/text: The EVO 95% canned cat food is great for my epileptic cat.  He had seizures consistently enough for me to go to the vet and get him on seizure meds.  After five days on the meds he stopped eating and couldn't walk.  Hes over weight so not eating is a death sentence for him.  I took him off the seizure meds and at the same time took him off dry food.  Know hes on a 100% wet EVO diet and holistic seizure drops.  He didn't have any seizures for a couple weeks, but my gf accidentally left the other cats Natural Balance dry food out and he got into it.  Sure enough a couple hours later he started having seizures because of the dry food.  The best bang for your buck is EVO 95% Chicken and Turkey, he hates the pasty 95% Beef, he also loves the Duck but the Duck is costly.  This diet also give him more energy, softer fur, and hes has no more diarrhea.  Diarrhea and a 28lb cat is a bad combo trust me! The litter boxes are really clean and less smelly with this food!

They won't eat the Venison, it's a harder consistency than the other ones.  I ended up donating those to the animal shelter.  But, I do recommend the duck flavor and will be purchasing a case of just this flavor.

review/summary: IT WORKS!
review/text: The EVO 95 has been the one thing that has stopped my cat from bleeding when he uses his litterbox...in other words, it stopped his colitis/internal allergies and he's been a healthy, active, loving cat since.  I couldn't get over the difference simply changing from a diet of hard/soft mix...which I was first on Royal Canin for him and then tried SD z/d...then went to this.  It worked...period.  To those bashing the company, quit the hysteria!  IT WORKS...and now both my cats are on it and doing well.  I lost two cats last year, and mine are doing well on this diet...and I'm thankful to have it!

review/summary: Good food...questionable company
review/text: I ordered some of the duck and venison food for my cat who recently developed a chicken allergy.  After reading mixed reviews and feeling a little desperate, I decided to give it a try.  Turns out all 3 of my cats loved both flavors, but the duck one gave my allergic kitty the same flaky skin.  The venison was a hit with all 3 as well but I'm not sure if I will continue to buy it.  It is so frustrating to have to deal with these companies selling out!  I don't understand why they don't keep the quality the same and just raise the price if they have to.  Seems like a much smarter move than to let the quality go down and let people and pets feel the brunt of that.  It does seem like a good food for now though along with the Natural Balance venison and several of the Natures Variety Instinct flavors. I also ordered some of the California Natural venison and have hopes that even though they were in the big buy out last spring, they will keep up quality for the sake of pets and their parents who have come to depend on them.

review/summary: Great for tube feeding! Kidney disease too
review/text: My cat has a feeding tube, so we need a wet food that blenderizes well and has an extremely smooth consistency (the tube diameter is about 2 mm). Normally the vet instructs you to use Hill's Prescription Diet a/d which is high calorie. I've been using the EVO 95% Duck and it's just PERFECT for this.<br /><br />Compared to the Hill's a/d it is superior. First, it's higher calorie (217/can vs 156/can) so we can give him fewer feedings in a day. Second, it's MUCH lower in phosphorus (0.35% vs 1.00%) which is important because my cat also has kidney disease. Finally, the quality of ingredients is superior. In general I think Hill's products are garbage, and the Prescription line is no different. a/d contains meat by-products. EVO 95% duck is high quality food -- no by-products or meals, just pure meat and broth.<br /><br />I can't comment on palatability, but for tube feeds it's great! My cat is doing very well on it too, he's happy and nourished.

review/summary: Diarrhea
review/text: I purchased this as it was recommended to my cat for 2 reasons. #1, he is diabetic and this is low-carb. #2, he has Irritable Bowel Syndrome, and being duck it is part of a "novel protein diet" meant to avoid any potential food allergies he may have had. My cat LOVES this food, unfortunately it gives him CONSTANT liquid poop. After further questioning, I found out from others that EVO frequently gives cats the runs. This is a most unpleasant side effect. I wish I did not purchase this case of food. If I feed it to my cat, his butt is running nonstop and he cant keep clean :(

review/summary: Class action lawsuit 2008 - July 2011
review/text: I went to their website yesterday, where I found information about a settlement for a class action lawsuit against this company.  You can read about it on their own website.  Apparently, since then, they have cleaned up their act and their food.  I bought four cans of the duck out of desperation because the shipment of Blue Buffalo Wilderness Wild Duck that I usually feed my cats hasn't arrived yet and I'm all out. I can't find it anywhere locally, so I gave in and bought four cans of EVO at a local pet supply store.  My cats ate it up immediately.  It smells ok, looks fresh, but I notice that the phosphorus level is three times higher than Blue's wild duck.  So as soon as Blue arrives, my cats will be going back to that.

review/summary: Not recommended by this cat breeder
review/text: We breed and raise cats who are typically not picky eaters. We purchased a case each of the large cans of Venison, Beef and Duck. The cats wont eat any of the three varieties. The food is very solid with a paste consistency. It also smells unpleasant. It is an expensive product with supposedly higher/better nutritional value. But, if the cats wont eat it, it has no value at all. When I called to talk with the manufacturer, they said they'd let some one know my complaint. Since they didn't take my name or contact info, I doubt they'll do anything. If you are wanting to try this food, go to the pet store and buy one can to try it out. Dont get stuck with 3 cases as we did.

review/summary: Love the product. Alert! Nagging question ahead.
review/text: I'm grateful to Lakewood for their Noni Juice. But I'm mystified as to why the change in serving size. First, let me tell you why I like the product.<br /><br />In the fall of last year I was, inadvertently, causing heart palpitations due to the fact that I was doing shoulder stands as part of my Yoga routine. I stopped the shoulder stands, and my heart returned to normal in about a week. But I was rundown and tired from two months of heart palpitations. So I picked up a bottle of Noni. I took the recommended serving, 1 tsp. per day. I felt nothing for two weeks. And then the Noni kicked in. I felt noticeably better every single day. Today (and for months now) I feel great. Now, here's where things get interesting.<br /><br />The bottle I bought six months ago says Serving Size is 1 tsp. (5 mL); Servings Per Container is listed as 190. Obviously, shelling out $25 every six months or so is no big deal for most of us.<br /><br />Now, if you look at the label on the newer shipment of Noni, you'll see a change in the Serving Size - 2 fl oz (4 TBSP); Servings Per Container 16.<br /><br />Yikes! Twenty-five dollars for a 16-day supply.<br /><br />So I contacted the  company on June 9 with my question - why the change in serving size?<br /><br />I'm still waiting for a reply.

review/text: I have a fairly large bird feeder at the front of the porch, and while the location is perfect, my local nuthatches were dropping a hundred seeds a day beneath the feeder into the garden below.  I spent hours this summer weeding sprouting seeds and removing molding piles of shells.  However, ater three weeks of using the seed hoop (30 inch--I wanted to be sure nearly all the seeds were caught), I've not had to weed once.  What's more, the birds have started using it as a second feeding station, especially larger birds who found the perches too small on the original feeder.  Excellent product!

review/text: Splenda Minis are a very convenient way to carry Splenda with you when traveling.<br /><br />I mostly use Splenda since the other non-sugar sweeteners have never tasted "right" to me, but not every restaurant or person I'm visiting serves it. I had started to carry the little packets (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6JPQQ">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granular, Individual Packets, 700-Count Box</a>) with me, but they get grungy if left in the pocket too long and do take up a good bit of space.<br /><br />The 200 Splenda Minis in the hard plastic dispenser are equal to 100 packets, so these will last a good long time. Note: Be sure to give the tablets time to dissolve and stir well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

You just squeeze the little tab and a tiny "pill" pops out. It's about the size of a baby aspirin maybe? But even though it's small, you don't need much - making it last a long time. I use two in my morning coffee and it's about the same as using two packets of loose Splenda. Also, it's nice to have in your purse at parties where people usually only have regular sugar. You can click it into your hand inside your purse and it's so discreet nobody will know what you're doing.

review/text: I have been ordering South River Miso for about 15 years. Before that I bought miso and Tamari from health stores and the occasional supermarket in a casual way, unaware of the quality issue. When I got my first order from South River my eyes (and taste buds) were opened and I know I was experiencing greatness! Everything this company makes is done with skill, integrity and care. I actually visited their location in Massachusetts some years ago and it was as beautiful and serene and authentic as I had hoped.  They make quite a few different "flavors" of miso and each one is superb. If you use miso only occasionally you can keep it in the fridge and it lasts a really long time without any deterioration. In fact the Tamari seems to age like fine wine. I've had some for over a year (again, refrigerated) and it just gets better. This miso is good for beginners too--if your only experience with miso has been a broth in a Japanese restaurant, you're in for a surprise treat. And of course for people who make miso and Tamari a major part of their diet, South River is the way to go. It's just the best there is.

I could not taste the rum like I do with other mixers!  And while this may be good for me, all guys know that a drink has to have good flavor for the girls!  Also, I can take this mix overseas and pack it in my suitcase because it is in powder form.  And lastly, it is a great idea for those of us on the Atkins or low carb diet.

review/summary: The best sugar free margarita mix out there
review/text: Every summer I buy at least $100 worth of this stuff.<br />Tequila has about 100cal per oz, so if you mix it with the regular mix you buy in the store you are getting 300-500 calories a drink!<br /><br />This mix and some 100% agave tequila and a splash of lime juice, (maybe a splash of triple sec too) is perfect and about 200-250 calories if you use 2oz of tequila per drink

review/text: We dilute the mix a little more than the recipe, add some Cointreau to the tequila, and they're wonderful. Even if you're not watching your calorie intake the sugar-free mixer will lessen any hangover effects the next day!

review/text: We opened the box to find the jelly beans sitting directly in the box.  No bag, no plastic container (as the description states)...just literally a cardboard box full of jelly beans.  How clean are cardboard shipping boxes?  The box was taped on top to seal it but air, bugs could easily get through the unsealed edges.  The jelly beans were good and still tasted fresh but we were very disappointed in the packaging.

review/summary: Pretty Spicy
review/text: These are good if you like spicy.  They made my tongue burn a little too much, so I'm sticking with the mint lacha- but the rest of my family likes these very much, because they like really hot food.  The expiration date on these was 5.2010- so that gives us a few months to eat them.  These are also very crunchy.  I liked them a lot- I just wish they had a less spicy version for people like me.

review/summary: Inedible and hard as a rock...literally!
review/text: I would normally give anyone (the seller in this case, not the maker) the benefit of the doubt on products, but these were awful!  They had to have been several years old at least!  The caramels were hard as a rock and inedible.  Unfortunately, I had already given a bag (they came pre-bagged) as a gift before I tried them.  I immediately called and apologized to the recipient after tasting.  The remaining four bags I unwrapped and fed to the wildlife.  They didn't even melt out in the rain if that gives you any idea how stale they were.  I definitely will NEVER buy from this dealer again.  They had to know how old they were before mailing.  And these candies were a favorite before this purchase. (Goetze Caramel Creams - 1 lb. divided into 5 bags)  I had to select a "star" for the rating since there isn't a catagory for being disatisfied.

He was up to 7 cups a day of food now down to 5.<br /><br />Your dog may eat less on this too since it it better quality food.
