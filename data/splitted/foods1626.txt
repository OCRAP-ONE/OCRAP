review/summary: I love these things!
review/text: I am really glad that I found the Ostrim snacks.  They have a nice meaty texture and are not oily like some of the other beef sticks out there.  I haven't tried the other flavors, but the natural is quite good.  I particularly like that they have 14 grams of protein.  Honestly, one stick and piece of fruit is a substantial "snack" that keeps you full for a while.  It's great that Amazon offers them on ship and save - - makes the price really affordable, too!  Try them, you'll like them!

review/summary: minimum calories ...maximum protein benefit and taste
review/text: Great quality meat sticks for a good price. These cost no more than a comarable size slim Jim and taste as good or better. The best part is the nutritional aspect. 80 calories, 1.5 grams of fat, 14 grams protein and 300 grams of sodium. Great snack option to bump your protein intake.

review/summary: Addictive, healthy beef jerky
review/text: As I become more aware of the nutritional values in foods, I try to find a good balance between taste and nutrition.  Ostrim has done it with this product.  I love regular beef jerky, but wanted a lower fat/sodium snack.  At 60 calories per pack with 1.5 grams of fat and only 290 grams of sodium, I found the nutrition I wanted in my jerky.  The taste actually exceeded my expectations, yes it is lower in sugar and sodium, but it still has a good meaty flavor and is much like a lean cut of meat.  The pepper flavor is light, but compliments the meat instead of overpowering it. I have now been eating this jerky for over a year and still think it is a good "healthy" snack for when I have to have some jerky.

review/summary: High protein snack
review/text: Finally, a high protein snack which really is just that- high protein, without excess fat or carbohydrate. VERY good for almost any diet, but especially for a low carb OR low fat diet. Require no refrigeration, easy to carry around, fairly easy to open. These sticks, at 1.5 oz., are larger than many similar products out there. One consideration- these are a bit higher in sodium than I would really like to see, though no higher than other similar products. The only problem I have had with these is eating too many! I have tried another flavor of these, and found the teriyaki flavor to be better.

review/text: Unlike protein bars that are trying to be a candy bar, and unlike most meat sticks, Ostrim is low in fat AND carbs (especially sugar). It has also got a good amount of potassium, which I really appreciate. If your are not a vegan or vegetarian, you will find that these are a good tasting and uncompromising way to get high quality protein as a snack instead of some garbage at the convenience store. Despite delivering only 80 calories I find this snack to be a satisfying way to hold myself over between meals.

review/summary: Best Jerky Ever
review/text: I purchased an Ostrim High Protein Snack at a juice bar after the gym one day, because of its high protein/low carb/low fat properties, expecting it to taste like a stick of cardboard, and was surprised at how good it was. I purchased a second snack as a novelty item (Ostrich meat) for my teenager, who loves beef jerky, and was stunned when he thought it was delicious. I immediately ordered two cases of Ostrim from Amazon (MUCH cheaper than buying them retail), and now my son takes one to school everyday for a midday snack. Who knew there could be healthy beef jerky that tastes great? Ostrim is AWESOME!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CU0N36">Ostrim High Protein Snack, Beef & Ostrich, Natural Flavor, 1.5-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 20)</a>

review/text: I bought the Ostrim while looking for a lower fat alternative to a Slim Jim. This is one of the best beef sticks that I have tasted. It is not oily or greasy like a Slim Jim.  It is low calorie (80 per stick), low fat (1.5g and only 15 fat calories) and high protein (14g).  If you like beef sticks try this and you'll probably like it.  I've tried the Pepper and the Natural flavors. Both were good, but I liked the pepper just a little better. The pepper flavor is not overwhelming, just a little spice to it.

review/summary: OK Tasting "Protein" Snack
review/text: I bought these as an alternative to protein shakes, tuna, or cold cuts when I wanted a quick protein-based snack.<br /><br />I have only tried the Natural flavor.  They're a bit salty and taste very similar to slim jims, but they are less greasy and MUCH larger.<br />Packaging is easy to open and not messy.<br /><br />The problem is the protein content: Just 14g/42g according to the nutritional info.<br />For reference, a standard can of tuna has two servings of 14g/58g protein.  A scoop of protein powder is about 28g of protein.<br />Also, despite what the product description states, it has 1.5g grams of total fat per stick.<br /><br />In short, a decent, but expensive, product if you are looking for a slim-jim style snack.<br /><br />I think I'll stick to protein powder for cheap protein, cold cuts/tuna when I want a protein-based snack, and some nice specialty Jerky when I want splurge on something chewy and flavorful.

review/summary: Major Ostrim Fan gets Major Food Poisoning - Timeline of Events
review/text: As someone who has been a fan of Ostrim products for the past five years, I have probably eaten 300-400 of these high protein snacks without incident.  Unfortunately, this was not the case with my purchase in February of 2011. In an attempt to shave costs off of my high protein diet that can over 1,000 dollars per month for one person, I decided to purchase 60 Ostrim sticks (3 x 20) in regular, barbecue and teriyaki flavors. Since the expiration dates of these are generally a year into the future, I assumed that I could store the sticks for several weeks.  I was dead wrong.<br /><br />After about four weeks of storing the sticks at room temperature, several of the shrink-wrapped air-tight sticks started inflating like balloons. This is a sign CO2 and methane being generated during decomposition. The inflated sticks were discarded and the few remaining that were still in their normal shrink-wrapped state were placed in a refrigerator.<br /><br />About a week later, I ate three refrigerated sticks just before heading to a venue for which I purchased tickets.  This enabled me to get an exact timeline of the events, which are chronicled below.  Suffice it to say, about four hours after eating three of the refrigerated sticks, I became deathly ill.  I am 99% certain the Ostrim sticks were the source of the food poisoning due to the highly controlled, high protein diet at the time where every food, calorie, and gram of protein was being monitored.<br /><br />The symptoms were so severe, I thought about going to the hospital. My girlfriend at the time was a physician who was able to provide some assurance that the issue was not life threatening. It took about three days to recover, which meant three days of zero productivity. In the end, a regular Ostrim consumer became someone who cringes at the very sight of the Ostrim display at my health club.<br /><br />Timeline of Ostrim Food Poisoning<br /><br />Event..........Date..........Time<br />Order from Amazon..........2/11/2011<br />Package Arrived ..........2/16/2011<br />Discard of inflated (decomposed) ..........

review/text: High in protein, low in fat, not greasy but you know you're eating a meat snack.  Smoky flavor is pretty good but I find that about 3/4 of the way through I'm about done with it, it starts getting just a bit too dry and a bit too bbqy.  I've been breaking them in half and eating the other half later.  My dog was quite thrilled with it when I left it on the table.  After reading that it was the #1 sports nutrition meat snack on the label, my 7 year old son started requesting them for his school snack, then began asking for extras for his friends.  I wonder if there is a #2 sports nutrition meat snack?<br /><br />I use these and several similar products to boost my protein intake on days when I'm running a bit low.  Perfect as one of a handful of tools suitable for that purpose.

Luckily I like them enough and the nutritional stats are great, so I'm going to stick with them. My only other complaint is I just got my second order and the outside of the stick is SO tough, like it's stale. I'm hoping it's just a fluke with the one box, but if it continues, I may have to cancel my order, as it was pretty bad.

I keep them stored in my freezer to ward off any mold problem that I've seen claimed (I do appreciate those comments for giving me a "heads up").  These are a great product that I recommend.

review/summary: Too Salty to Enjoy
review/text: I just received these a few days ago. Had my first one only minutes ago. Now I need to drink a gallon of water. a sing 42gram serving has 300mg of sodium . Texture and beef/ostrich flavor is fine but is hidden by the heavy handed use of salt. I wish I could return the product.

review/summary: Not too great
review/text: These protein sticks have a very strong "gamy" flavor. It's hard to describe -- it's not sickening, but it is weird. Also, they are extremely dry. Having purchased them, I'll finish them, but I doubt I will buy them again.<br /><br />*Update* On second thought, I may have to throw these out. I've eaten them twice, and both times they caused me some moderate gastrointestinal distress.

review/summary: Great Tasting and Satisfying!
review/text: I've been looking into finding more high protein snacks with low carbs and calories and this snack fits the bill.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the high sodium content.  I'd really like to see a lower sodium version of these sticks, even if it's just removing 100mg of sodium would be great.<br /><br />But it tastes great, everyone in the family likes them.  I've tried the spicy pepper from a local store and loved it, but it would have been too spicy for the kids so I purchased the 2 boxes of terriyaki from Amazon.  I'll probably buy the spicy again and just horde it for myself while getting bbq as well so the kids can have those.

review/text: I love the taste of these sticks and their high protein content, no issues there. My problem with this product is that it creates, for me, a case of explosive, deadly, gas. And I mean deadly as in clearing the family room during prime time deadly! Not sure if it's the milk content (I am lactose intolerant), or what other ingredient may be causing it, but I now only eat one or two of these a week. Again, could just be me, but wanted to warn others of this benign, but potentially humiliating, side effect.

review/summary: Jerkee not jerky
review/text: Maybe I should have picked up on the name "Jerkee" but this is not even close to regular jerky. I don't actually mind the label on front that says "nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist "jerkee."  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky. I used to buy the Wild West brand of jerky here on amazon. It's flavorful and not very sinewey or tough, yet it's real jerky. I'll force myself to finish this stuff and then go back to that or try another brand.

review/text: I was excited to get a healthy protein treat and I was hugely disappointed.  I opened the first one and was appalled by the smell. I managed to choke down three bites and the only good thing I can say about this stuff is that it didn't make me sick immediately. I threw the rest away. Later I went back in the kitchen and thought I smelled where my little dog had an accident but it was only the open package reeking from the trash.  I have eaten homemade  ostrich jerky but this tastes nothing like it. It is hard to believe it is ostrich. Do not buy this product. Even my cats and dog couldn't eat it.

review/summary: Picky eaters like it
review/text: I have a Bichon and a Maltese that get picky with their food occasionally.  They both have food sensitivities, so I give them as much natural ingredients as possible.  Their dry food is about 3/4 or more of their meal (Venison/Sweet potato or Bison/Sweet potato Natural Balance brand) and their wet food is canned food.<br /><br />My Maltese is much pickier than my Bichon, though my Bichon has more allergies.  Since giving them this combination of dry and canned food, the dark spots on their skin have cleared up.  Neither have had a problem with the reddish eye staining that you see with a lot of dogs (due to food additives).  My Maltese used to turn her nose up at most canned food, but she is anxious to eat this.  And since I have been feeding my Maltese this combination, she has become more regular.

review/summary: Great Way To Buy These Biscuits! My Dog Loves Them.
review/text: My dog is medium in size, but he doesn't like large bones or treats. These are tiny, and I think he thinks he's getting more, because he gets them more often. They are easier for him to eat though and he doesn't need large ones because I don't want him to overeat.<br /><br />He also has a sensitive stomach and these don't bother him.<br /><br />Good choice for us and SO convenient to have them delivered right to the door. I'm hoping my dog will come to think of the UPS delivery man as a friend, but so far it isn't happening.<br /><br />EDITED to say that this order contains a lot of dog biscuits! I think I bought too much for one dog. It's going to take a long time to finish all those boxes. I probably should have bought less or added more dogs.  :)

review/summary: My dogs love them!
review/text: Up until recently I have had 4 dogs. Sadly, one passed away from old age this past July. Anyway, all four of my dogs love these Iams biscuits. My finickiest dog never turns them down although she has turned down other brands of biscuits. The only thing that puzzles me is that the biscuits are now thinner than they used to be. They must still taste the same since my dogs still gobble them up. I had brought up this inconsistency to an Iams rep at a dog show about a year ago. His only answer was that they had 2 manufacturing companies and one must be making them thinner than the other company. I would think that their standards on this would be fairly strict so that the 2 companies would be manufacturing identical products, but apparently not. Oh well, it's not really a problem as long as my dogs remain elated with them, and since they are sold by weight there's nothing sneaky going on as far as I can tell. I love that I can order a pack of 6 on Amazon.com. Many times the stores do not have that many, so the 6-pack is really convenient since my dogs go through these pretty quickly.

The older dog has few teeth left (she was abused and we rescued her). A lot of treats we buy are to hard for her to eat but these are the right texture and hardness. She can chew them up and she loves them as well. Perfect for giving to the dogs after they use the bathroom.<br /><br />The value is great. I didn't really think about how many boxes 6 of these were but the deal is that much better when you actually see how many treats you have. It's an amazing amount and I'm set with treats for a few months at least!<br /><br />Great deal, I will be placing a new order when I start running low.... But that will be a long time!!<br /><br />I uploaded a picture so you can see how much the little dog loves these thing!

review/text: I live in an isolated town, and you cannot purchase Iams dog biscuits within a four hour radius.  Unfortunately, Iams small biscuits are all my parents' spoiled dogs will eat for a snack.  Like another reviewer's dog, these dogs will not eat large biscuits, even though one is a Great Dane and the other is a lab mix.<br /><br />When I found the monthly subscription on Amazon and found they were slightly cheaper than in the stores (where I can no longer buy them; thank you, over-sized "super" stores that carry fewer and fewer products since you feel the consumer is at your mercy), I immediately ordered them.  They arrived a week later with free shipping.<br /><br />The packaging was neat and tight; very few biscuits were broken in the opened box.  They were also very fresh.  The expiration date was June 15, 2012.  Traditionally, the ones I've purchased in stores were only good for six months or less.  I subscribed for two six packs a month, and it's very satisfying to know I don't have to worry about my mother haranguing me to drive to Mississippi to pick up dog biscuits.  They come to the PO box once a month: No fuss, no muss, no bother.  And the dogs are infinitely happier. :)

review/summary: Texas Transplant
review/text: I grew up in Little Italy in NYC. I have eaten biscotti (quaresimale) since I was a kid. It is impossible to purchase these specialty cookies at any bakeries here in Texas.  However, I discovered this particular brand (La Dolce Vita) at Costco a couple of months ago. I found the price to be irresistible, since the bakeries in NYC charge about $12/pound. I found that the flavor and crisp consistency of this particular brand was very comparable to that to which I was accustomed.  In addition, these biscotti stay fresh when left in their container.  The almonds are always crisp, and never rancid.  The anisette flavor is ideal and not overdone.  Since it is never certain whether Costco will continue to carry this brand, I have researched this company, so that I might continue to purchase their exquisite product. I noticed that previous buyers have noticed that their cookies have arrived damaged. I am certain that the company will correct this problem.  Any company that took such pains to create this outstanding product will certainly improve their shipping problem. Buon Appetitto!!

review/text: The service was fast and as promised. Unfortunately, the Biscotti was broken into very small pieces, with very few pieces intact.The product was padded at both ENDS of the box, but not the sides, and had obviously been mishandled. Sorry, but I would not risk buying this product by mail order again.

review/text: Well deserving of their long standing reputation for quality, Carr's Table Water Crackers are very satisfying. Especially enjoy the cracked pepper because, while the flavor is subtle, it is distinctly a fresh ground flavor.<br /><br />My only criticism has to do with packaging. Not sure the extra outer cellophane is really necessary ... but I'll leave that to the experts who have been successfully making these crackers for ages.

review/text: I discovered Carr's Table Water Crackers one year during the holidays, and I fell in love. I often make a meal of cheese and crackers with a cup of coffee. The added zip of the cracked pepper in this version of the crackers inspired me to come up with toppings to equal the cracker itself. Cream cheese with diced tomatoes. Deli-thin slices of baked ham or roast beef with Swiss cheese, or sliced roast turkey with Muenster cheese. Super-thin slices of salami or pepperoni with sliced Mozzarella. Delicious!

review/text: No, I love these crackers.  I buy 'em all the time and they're pretty plain, but high quality and that cracked pepper gives a nice bit of zip to the taste that just makes it that much better.<br /><br />This SHOULD be a 5 star review; packaging was great, no crackers broken in the couple of boxes I've opened as of yet.  Just not too bad at all<br /><br />EXCEPT<br /><br />The order that I placed on May 8, 2007 came packed with 12 boxes of crackers that all expire on June 30, 2007.<br /><br />I've yet to see a single box of these crackers in the local stores with such an early expiration date.<br /><br />The nice price and the free shipping was quickly compromised by Amazon taking a batch of crackers with a short shelf life and pushing them on special.  In the end, the loser is me.  When calling Amazon with the hopes of a fair exchange or something a little reasonable, there was no flexibility.<br /><br />Lesson learned by me and a forewarning to others:  Take caution purchasing perishables from Amazon.<br /><br />Shame on you, Amazon.

review/summary: A nice 'get acquainted' variety pack
review/text: I have been trying to replace my former supplier of single-origin coffee (which raised its shipping prices five fold!) here on Amazon, without too much luck up until now.  Can't say I didn't try.  I have 20 lbs of coffee; sinlge origin beans I love, BUT the roaster has maybe gone to roasting more than they can handle?  The beans taste burnt, leave a bitter after taste.<br />I had some qualms about ordering from coffee masters given the number of flavored coffees they carry, which generally indicates either inferior beans, or that they are producing for a clientele which does not know coffee.  Because of this I was wary of ordering and got this sampler, *hoping*, as noone had yet described the contents, that it would not contain any flavored coffee.  and, I am happy to report, it does not.<br />For those of you as baffled as I as to what is in the box, here it is:<br />Brazilian Santos<br />Columbian Huila<br />Costa rican Terrazu<br />Ethiopian (Mocha) Harrar<br />"euro Espresso" blend<br />French roast blend<br />Guatamalan "Amatitlan"<br />Hawaiian blend<br />Kenya AA<br />Louisiana blend<br />Mexican "Coatepec"<br />Sumatra Mandheeling<br /><br />Thus far i have only tried 2; the Ethiopian and thr Brazillian Santos, and, overall i am impressed,  It is beyond the shadow of a doubt the best of what I have purchased on Amazon, and I have read dozens and dozens of reviews to avoid getting another 5,10, 15 pound of mediocre burned coffee.<br />While the Ethiopian was not the very best I have had, it is right up there.<br />The Brazilian really surprised me.  I basically never buy light roast, do not like "weak" coffee, but this was most excellent; not weak but smooth, full, well rounded.  I am off to change my subscriptions.  I think I have found myself a roaster here at last!<br />and, now that I know what they can do will be ordering the whole bean., which I expect to be better still. (if it is the same, I will still be very happy)

The variety ranges from Kenya AA to Hawaiian to Louisiana Blend, etc.  If you appreciate good coffee you won't regret buying this.

review/summary: Delicious coffee that's fun to try
review/text: I started drinking coffee only a few months ago, so before trying these I had absolutely no idea what types of coffee I liked. I bought this so that I could experiment with a variety of different coffees in a short period of time without having to invest in much larger bags of coffee, that I may or may not enjoy, over many months. I've gone through nine out of the twelve coffees in the box in less than a month and I already know what I'll be buying again - the Euro Espresso Blend.<br /><br />Each bag makes 8-10 cups of coffee, but because I have a very large coffee cup (about 16 ounces), I get anywhere from 4-5 cups of coffee. Just the right amount. In each bag the grounds are very dark and loosely packed. They're not coarse or dry like instant coffee. The smell is fantastic.<br /><br />I haven't tasted a coffee yet that I don't like, although some are better than others. And that's the fun part!<br /><br />Don't buy this if you're just looking to stock your pantry with coffee. The packages are small and inconvenient to store if you're not using all the grounds in one shot. Obviously, in terms of quantity, the coffee is overpriced. The real value is in the variety, not the amount.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with my decision and I'll be buying from Coffee Masters again.

review/text: Okay, they're Dentastix, not much to say about them except that it's handy not to have to run to the store for dog treats and with Subscribe and Save, they were even less than Target or Petsmart.<br /><br />Our rat terrier is a rescue with not-so-great teeth. We had his teeth cleaned when we brought him home, but he's not fond of really hard bones.

At his 14 pound weight, he can have 1 or 2 a day, but I usually just break one in half so he can have them more often.<br /><br />Beware of the SMALL size, they are for dogs over 25 pounds.

He hates having his teeth cleaned, and his breath will literally knock you over on a bad day. : )<br /><br />So I started giving these treats to him 2-3 times daily and everyone who was aware of his atrocious breath agrees its 100% better! I have even noticed a difference in the coloring of his teeth...which suggests to me that this product's claims of removing tartar buildup are actually true!<br /><br />Although these treats claim to be for a toy/small dog, they work well for him and me...he's 65 lbs. and has a tendency to make big messes with larger treats!

They will also "leave it" until I tell them to "go".  They are so well trained to "leave it" that I have to insist to get them to grab it.  Sometimes my little male gets himself so excited to get one of these, I swear if he had pants on, he'd pee in them.  I put one in front of him and one in front of my female and he'll be looking at hers and his - back and forth - trying to figure out how he can get both of them before she gets hers.  She seems to be deaf when I say "go", so I have to hand hers to her so he won't grab it out from under her.  Pretty comical and entertaining to watch.  Guess I should shoot a video of it so you can enjoy watching them as much as I do.

review/summary: Made in the USA/or poss Canada - but these perfect for an old Dawgie
review/text: Have always relied on Pedigree* for all 'special' Animal treats.  This cost of these Mini sized has been escalating at Big Box stores. Bought the case here and the expiration is a year away - October 2013 - a bonus as now the Old Dawg can have one daily

review/summary: Time tested favorite treat
review/text: I have an 11 year old Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier. I've been giving her Dentastix for over 9 years. She absolutely loves them. I started giving her these for oral care. I can't brush her teeth because I've got a chronic pain condition that effects my dexterity. I gave her "Beggin Strips" for a treat. After a few months, she stopped wanting the "Strips" and only wants the Dentastix. I checked with her Veterinarian and she said they are safe to give her more than 1 or 2 a day.<br /> I was hospitalized 9 years ago for 3 weeks and she stayed with relatives. When we both got home, her bathroom habits were all messed up. To fix things, I started to give her half a Dentastix when she went where she was suppose to. After a couple of weeks, her bathroom habits were corrected. The only problem was now, instead of going to the bathroom 2 to 3 times a day, she either pees a little or defecates the size of a penny whenever she wants a Dentastix.<br /> As far as their effectiveness as a tooth cleaner, she has never needed her teeth cleaned. They are in perfect health. I should know, I was a Dentist before I became ill.<br /> I get them sent every 2 months to make sure the are fresh. Having them sent automatically also saves a few dollars.
