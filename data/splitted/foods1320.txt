review/summary: All India Tree products are great, this is no exception
review/text: I love using India Tree sugars because they have perfect flavor and consistency.  This caster sugar dissolves instantly in liquids, perfect for sweetening everything from margaritas to whipping cream.  It quickly sweetens iced drinks without the grit on the bottom of the glass that you get with regular sugar.  Perfect for baking and creme brulee too. The 3 pound jar is a wonderful value and nice size to have in your pantry to insure you always have some on hand. Free shipping on 6 pounds is a great deal with Amazon!<br /><br />PS> India Tree Muscavado sugar is amazing, the best dark sugar on the market!

review/text: I am very satisfied with the Caster Sugar I received on Amazon.  I could not find it anywhere in any of the large grocery stores I shop at.  The jars came in sealed tight packaging (which is very important to me).  The containers are a nice size (3 lb. jars) in a convenient 2-pack.  Jars are plastic (I prefer glass, but you know fussy me, as usual) and the plastic is just fine.  The shipment arrived faster then expected, wow...so overall I am a very satisfied customer with the product and the service.  Will buy from again.

We broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste.  But they are too much work to purchase again.

review/text: This is a great sauce but be warned it is extremely hot.  It uses the world's hottest pepper, the Bhut Jolokia.  Unfortunately, unlike some sites that actually sell sauces online, you don't know the ingredients to the sauce and so for those that like to know before you buy, here it is: Bhut Jolokia pepper, carrots, papayas, lime juice, vinegar, onion, passion fruit juice, citric acid, garlic, salt and xanthan gum.

review/text: Seriously, anyone who says this is hot must have very low heat tolerance.  This is a 4/10 on a heat scale at the most.  Within 3 days of my receiving this bottle of hot sauce, it was already half finished (went with rice, fries and a burger).  My wife's cayenne pepper chicken is hotter than this.  Seriously, you can use this in place of ketchup on your fries.  Supposedly has naga jolokia inside but i did not feel the heat.  Probably has more cayenne and habanero than jolokia. Chilli-padi has more kick than this.

review/summary: All Natural
review/text: I ordered this product and received it three days after I had place the order. First off let me start off by saying this is not a sauce that is designed to melt your face off. You will read other reviews saying that this sauce is not hot. The Bhut Jolokia is cooled down immensly for the benefit of it's great taste. In this sauce you can taste the carrots and onions which compliment the mild sting you get from the Bhut Jolokia. It it definately not close to 1,000,000 SHU. I would say it is somewhere around 400,000 SHU from the amount of heat it will produce but it that isn't a bad thing. This is a wonderful tasting sauce that you can enjoy with a bowl of chili or a some pasta.<br /><br />If you want something that produces enough heat that will make you feel like your face is be gulged out by a red hot shovel, then this is not it. If you want a great tasting sauce that you can enjoy with a meal then this is a good one to try.

review/summary: ONE OF THE BEST!!!
review/text: After trying this one on everything from a chimichanga to a calzone, I feel that it compliments fish and seafood the best! But latley I've been using it on my hot chicken cutlet w/muenster hero. I would like to thank Mocha for listing the ingredients. The papaya, passion fruit and lime juice could explain why it works so well with fish, not so good with beef or pork. As for the "burn", it is truly one of the hottest sauces but with a great flavor. Instead of scorching your throat, it offers a slowly creeping, long lasting "heat" that will surely clear your sinuses and correct your vision!!!<br /><br />Note: My second bottle wasn't as good as the first. It had a sort of "burnt" taste that dominated the flavor and the heat was more "harsh" and didn't last. I intend to write the company and suggest they watch thier QC more closely.

review/text: EXTRACT FREE!! I am not a fan of the metallic taste of extract based sauces, so this more natural approach is similar to the super-hot sauces I make at home. I usually use Bhut, Trinidad, and 7 pot, so this sauce is right on par with my home sauce. I am guessing somewhere in the realm of 200k SHU, sweat inducing, good mouthburn, but usable as a condiment and not only as a torture test. Recommended.

review/text: I love just about anything boysenberry, and I have tasted quite a few syrups, jams etc.  I used to use Smucker's mostly, but I noticed that the flavor of their syrups had diminished so I quit buying them.  I thought I'd try Pioneer Valley "Gourmet" Boysenberry Syrup even though it cost me about $12 for an 11.5 oz bottle after shipping.  It was not what I expected.  It lacked the same rich boysenberry flavor I had missed in other syrups.  Don't get me wrong,  the ingredients are wholesome.... no water or corn syrup, and boysenberry juice is listed first on the bottle.  In my opinion, the juice gets too diluted with the other ingredients, and a juice concentrate should be used instead.

When you order, it is for a single and they are about the size of a small fist. My dogs did like them, however they have been at it for about 15 minutes and they are already half gone. So they don't last too long. With the price you pay for shipping I don't think this product is worth it. I have gotten treats by this brand before though and my dogs really liked them.

review/text: I have three dogs and they all like different flavors. One of them has to be on allergy free diet and I tried different brands. They would eat it, but then it was so plain flavor wise, so I had to add wet food as well, so they would eat it. It was getting old..And then we got a third dog, and he used to eat chicken meal, and it's a big NO NO for my allergy doggy. So I tried to get a brand that everybody would enjoy, and I mean from 17 pounds Shih Tzu to 98 pounds Golden Doodle. And Oh my God, it's a miracle, they all gobbled this food, I feed them venison only. It's very flavorful, mid size bites, and I do not have to mix it with wet food, that's how good this food is! Trust me, if three dogs could agree on one kind of food and they eat it ,like they were on starvation for weeks, it's says a lot! And it's limited ingredient food , so it's good for maintaining allergy free feeding.

review/summary: Great product
review/text: My dog has had some skin issues (about a month after we adopted him we found out that he has mange), and his coat wasn't looking very nice. After getting him some medicine and switching his food to Natural Choice he looks like a new dog. His fur is soft, smooth and shiny now as opposed to how coarse and dull it used to be. He is kind of picky about his food as well, and he really loves this. Great product!

review/summary: Nice tasting with a minimum of caffeine
review/text: If you are like me & don't like to drink caffeine, then this is the drink for you. One packet of this has about 80 mg* of caffeine, so it's enough to get you going but not enough to make you crash later unless you are extremely sensitive. If you normally drink lots of caffeine, this probably won't affect you at all & I would recommend trying the wild strawberry flavor which has far more caffeine in it. It doesn't have the extra stuff that focus does, but it will give you more of a "buzz".<br /><br />Now for flavor. If you are a fan of orange/citrus drinks, odds are that you'll like this. The flavor reminds me of a mix between a McDonald's orange drink & a sports drink. I have to admit that it took about 2 packets for the flavor to grow on me, though.<br /><br />*The box says 40 mg per serving, but the packet contents are actually for TWO servings, not one. If you are extremely caffeine sensitive or can't have caffeine then you may want to skip this drink entirely.

review/summary: Excellent Product
review/text: So I've ordered this product many times as a result of the subscriptions and boy have I not regretted it. The flavor is excellent with hints of lime and orange and its not too sweet. The added plus is the fact it has mental stimulants to help you. I will say that I am NOT caffeine sensitive so as a result the added plus here has little effect on me which causes this product to be a 4 star rather than a 5 star. However, its best trait is the flavor. Definitely one of the best flavors crystal light has created.

review/text: I came across this flavor by chance when looking to order Red Tea. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I'm so glad I did! It is now my favorite flavor. I have never found a store that carries it where I live, so I order online all the time. I'm a coffee drinker, and my tolerance is pretty high, so the "energy" part is not that prevalent, but still 5-stars in my book!

review/text: This one is better than the Lipton Citrus drink mix. But then just about anything is better than that. I have tried several of these beverage mixes over the last couple of months and this is one of the few that I will be buying  again, It has a clean crisp flavor that the other citrus flavored mixes miss.<br />  Of all the different brands that I've tried the Crystal Light is the one that's the best. Some of them are a bit on the sweet side and used in a 20 oz bottle instead of a sixteen is better.<br />  Overall I prefer the Rassberry or Cherry flavors over the Citrus but for something different I'd choose this one.

review/summary: Not as sour as they used to be.
review/text: These gumballs, back in the day when they were marketed as "Tear Jerkers," were really sour. They lived up to their name, in spades. After looking all over the Internet for them, I got the message that they were now called "Cry Baby" instead, so I very happily plunked my money down, looking forward to the eye-wincing sourness that made the old "Tear Jerkers" so magnificent. But these seem sweet rather than sour; the sourness lasts only for a moment or two and it is not the wonderful bone-shaking, salivary-gland-aching, grapefruit-in-the-eye-squinting sourness that I remembered. So, yeah, they're good. They're just not great. I miss "Tear Jerkers".  :`(

review/summary: Toned-down version of a classic
review/text: I am a lover of bold flavors, especially spicy and sour. I was psyched to find a few Tear Jerkers gumballs, individually wrapped, in mixed bags of candy we were handing out to kids in a parade this weekend.  I tried all three "flavors" that I found in the bag (red, green, and blue), and found all of them to be disappointing when held up against my memories of being able to barely tolerate them when I was in high school.<br /><br />They are sour, but not "lock your jaw up" sour like they used to be. I remember them almost rivaling the sour power of Warheads... and while I still find Warheads to be ridiculous for the first few seconds, these gumballs just don't compare to the ones I remember. Good, not great.<br /><br />The only caveat I would add is that it was not "Cry Baby" gumballs, but "Tear Jerkers Sour Bubble Gum" printed on the wrappers. They're both manufactured by Tootsie Roll Industries, so they're pretty likely to be the same thing, but I haven't done a side-by-side comparison.

review/text: These are great to eat as a low-cost, low-calorie snack. I often find that by eating Cry Babies, I can go a long time without eating sweets. They are not as sour as Warheads, and I really enjoy the taste. It would be nice if the flavor lasted longer, though. Also, the ones toward the bottom get harder to chew than the ones near the top. In my experience, one container lasts several months, and I do eat them regularly.

review/text: The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.  I had really hoped for more flavor from the meat, being grass fed and high quality, however, all I could taste was salt, and lots of it.  The jerky was extremely salty and that's pretty much all you could taste.<br />I think that perhaps next time I will order one of their other flavors and see if it fares better.<br /><br />Overall good jerky, just a little too salty for my taste.

review/text: the other ingredients are not so healthy and unfortunately I'm unable to review the flavor as I forgot I can't have beef anymore (due to health issues).<br /><br />Ingredients:  beef, flavoring supplement (salt, dextrose, corn syrup solids, maltodextrin, spices, spice extractives, soybean oil), vinegar, brown sugar, liquid smoke, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, spices<br /><br />Here is some info found on the internet:<br /><br />Maltodextrin ~ maltodextrin from corn or soy can be very unsafe/poison for anyone. As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!

review/summary: Not what I expected!
review/text: I purchased this product because I wanted to get a bulk price (5 pack) for camping this fall, and I was actually looking for Black Label, but could only find Tyson.  If you love Black Label, I can assure you will not love Tyson's fully-cooked bacon.  The appearance is similar, but the smoke flavor is quite different (obviously different wood) and it's much saltier.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it a 3 star rating is that the stiff plastic packaging opens very quickly (I was testing it today while making an omelet and needed to get it open in a hurry) as opposed to the Hormel product, which is in a cardboard box that is wasteful and doesn't really reclose, and its internal bag is very flimsy and doesn't protect the bacon well.  But unfortunately for me, flavor is even more important than packaging, and if I had not liked the packaging, I would have given this product a 1.  Black Label lovers beware.

review/text: Generally like the Guiltless Gourmet chips - these were too spicy though.  Just didn't like the flavor - too intense.  I am sure if someone wanted chips with this much spice they would probably like them better than I did.

review/summary: Awesome and Healthy!
review/text: These chips were so yummy and super healthy.  I work in the fitness industry and I don't mind having a few of these chips with my sandwich for lunch or telling our clients about this great alternative to other "snacks" that are unhealthy.  This flavor is awesome and I can't wait to try more.  Thanks for filling my "salty" craving with something healthy!

review/summary: What a find!!!
review/text: These chips are next to impossible to find in supermarkets.  They're made with excellent ingredients including organic corn.  They're spicy and are delicious alone, with salsa or piled with nacho goodies.  They're low in fat and calories...3g fat and 120 calories for 18 sizable chips.  You can't go wrong with this product.

review/summary: Truly AWESOME flavor in a "good for you" tortilla chip!
review/text: I originally heard about these chips through Hungrygirl.com and went all the way to Pittsburgh, PA (4 hours from my home) in order to pick up a bag because no stores carry the product in WV.  I'm glad I could mail order a case, but if I couldn't, I'm here to tell you it would be worth the trip back up to Pittsburgh to stock up.  I am particularly fond of the chili lime flavor . . . lots of zip and perfect with fresh salsa!!  Beware!  Once you try them, you're sure to be hooked!

review/summary: Rice and Beans 'til I die
review/text: So I know this guy, and he's been eating these things at least 3 times a week for over, like, 10 years or more. Well I thought that was sort weird, ya know, at first...  But then I found myself stranded at his house one day, forced to join him in a meal of Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans.  And my life has never been the same since.  Seriously.  Ask any of my friends.  A mushrooming explosion of zestful flavor (not actual mushrooms) in your mouth belies the simple and inexpensive 6.4-Ounce package.  Did I mention it's Zesty?<br /><br />But the problem was, Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans, 6.4-Ounce Packages weren't available in any local stores.  My friend (who I didn't think was so weird anymore) had to travel four hours north by motor vehicle just to buy them, year after year.  But today we can celebrate our good friends at Amazon.com for making this hidden culinary nugget readily available to all (and for saving my friend a lot of gas money).<br /><br />And can you guess how I'm going to celebrate??

review/summary: A new favorite
review/text: I bought this product based largely on the review by the crazy guy below who eats this on a daily basis.  After eating about 10 packages of the rice, I've got to say that he knows what he is talking about.  This really is a meal in itself.  It is easy to prepare- though it does take me longer than 7 minutes (maybe closer to 15 minutes) to prepare.<br /><br />The rice and beans have just the right amount of spice- somewhat mild- and provide an easy base to add whatever you want to it.  I've added chicken and recently ham.<br /><br />One packet makes enough for two small bowls worth of rice and beans.  I've tried making two packets at once, but it didn't come out too well.<br /><br />Overall, I think it's worth a try.  You may become hooked on rice and beans, like I did.

review/text: Since I haven't seen many new reviews, I decide to make this one for a few comments.<br />It's quick to make, it fills you up  which is fine.<br />It lacks a little bit more spices, it seems bland to me. I usually cook it in the microwave, so I'd just add what ever I want to it.<br />Other than that, its a great product for a college student.

review/summary: Deeeelishis!
review/text: I came across this rice by accident while looking for Lipton soups. I saw it had a great rating, but some of the reviewers mentioned and compared it to a few other similar products by different brands. I had a really hard time on deciding which brand to go with. I finally went with this one and I'm sooo glad I did! Once I received this 12 pack, it's literally all I ate over the next few days until it was gone.<br /><br />This stuff is delicious! One bag (if you don't add anything else) makes exactly one full (to the top) regular size bowl. It takes about 8 minutes total to cook and requires only water. I don't like my rice really moist, so I put a little less water than what's suggested. The taste is great and it's pretty strong without adding anything else. On my 2nd bag I added some of my beloved taco seasoning to it (the Taco Bell seasoning bags you can find anywhere), which really enhanced the flavor and took it over the top.<br /><br />If you want something quick, simple, cheap and delicious, you will not go wrong with this. I came back for two more 12 packs.<br /><br />UPDATE: I still love these and usually eat one per day until I run out, trying to pace myself. :) I've been buying these regularly every couple of weeks.

review/text: The Lipton/Knorr Cajun Sides Red Beans & Rice is excellent! We love cooking up some Jimmy Dean's spicey or regular sausage and mixing it in and man is it excellent. You can make a wonderful quick and easy meal out of it. Simple enough that your kids or even your husband can make it and delicious! We live overseas and it is getting harder and harder to find these in stores. They have some, but not the Cajun Red Beans & Rice, so when I found them on Amazon.com we were so excited. Then we had to have some friends bring them back from a trip to the USA in their luggage. But we are so happy because man are they sooo good. If you have not tried them before try it with some sausage and you will be impressed.

review/summary: Zero to yummy in 8 minutes flat!
review/text: If you haven't had the 6.4oz Package of Lipton Cajun Sides, Rice & Beans, you have no idea of the goodness you are missing.  My grandma gave me her "special" recipe for the proper preparation of this tasty dish, with a couple of little "twists".  Now pay close attention.<br /><br />You will need the following:<br /><br />1 Cooktop<br /><br />1 Large Skillet<br /><br />1 standard tablespoon<br /><br />1 Tablespoon Butter<br /><br />3 Cups of warm water<br /><br />1 Bottle of tabasco (containing at minimum 15 dashes of tabasco)<br /><br />1 "good sized" handful of toasted almond slivers<br /><br />Several slices of frozen chicken breast<br /><br />An icemaker with "crush" feature (or a hammer)<br /><br />1 large bowl<br /><br />First, turn the cooktop on high, put the skillet on the cooktop.<br /><br />Next, in no particular order, dump the contents of the 6.4 oz packet, the water, the chicken, the nuts, 15 shakes of tabasco, and 1 tablespoon of butter (use the aforementioned tablespoon, but don't wash it yet) into the skillet,<br /><br />Then, walk away for 8 minutes.  Here is the beauty of this meal.  So far, you should have a sum total of about 60 seconds of labor invested in this meal.  You don't even need to stir, it does it for you, stirring totally optional, unnecessary even.<br /><br />Now, get the bowl, put it under the icemaker and let 'er rip until 5 cubes have been crushed into your bowl.  Take the bowl to the sink, take the skillet off of the cooktop over to the sink, use your unwashed spoon to scoop the mixture out of the skillet and into the bowl with the 5 crushed cubes of ice in it.<br /><br />Rinse the skillet, it works best while the rice/beans residue is still hot, and it gives the ice a chance to melt.<br /><br />Go to the bowl, now using your trusty tablespoon, stir the mixture and eat!  It should be at a perfect temperature, hot, but not so hot you can't eat it.

review/summary: Red beans and rice from scratch is just as easy to make.
review/text: I absolutely do not get why anyone would make red beans and rice from this package instead of from scratch. It is just as easy to make your own. Read the ingredients list on this--what is some of that stuff?<br /><br />The home made version tastes so much better. You just take a cup of long grain rice, add two and a quarter cups of water, a quarter teaspoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of cayenne pepper, stir until combined, bring all this to a boil over medium heat stirring once then turn heat down to low and simmer for 20 minutes.<br /><br />While it is simmering, cut up a polish kielbasa sausage and heat it in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of sizzling hot saved bacon grease or olive oil or peanut oil or whatever you like. When the rice is done simmering, add the sausage and two cans of well rinsed kidney beans. Stir it all and cover the lid over it for a couple minutes to let it rest.

review/text: The beef jerky was pretty good, I really like the texture and the dryness of it.  I prefer a dry jerky that can be broken apart pretty easily and this was what I got from this jerky.  I had really hoped for more flavor from the meat, being grass fed and high quality, however, all I could taste was salt, and lots of it.  The jerky was extremely salty and that's pretty much all you could taste.<br />I think that perhaps next time I will order one of their other flavors and see if it fares better.<br /><br />Overall good jerky, just a little too salty for my taste.

As all GMO products like corn and soy are genetically engineered from the monsanto company. they insert a bacteria in all GMO products, and this changes the natural organic developing of corn or soy. do not buy anything that contains maltodextrin or titanium for your own health.<br /><br />Maltodextrin made in the US is made from corn.<br />Corn in the US is a GMO food so Maltodextrin as derived from a Gmo is extremely unsafe.<br /><br />Soy ~ this particular info from:<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />. . .fermented soy products such as natto, tempeh, miso and soy sauce, and enjoying the health benefits. Fermented soy does not wreak havoc on your body like unfermented soy products do.<br /><br />Here is just a sampling of the health effects that have been linked to unfermented soy consumption:<br /><br />*Breast cancer<br />*Brain damage<br />*Infant abnormalities<br />*Thyroid disorders<br />*Kidney stones<br />*Immune system impairment<br />*Severe, potentially fatal food allergies<br />*Impaired fertility<br />*Danger during pregnancy and nursing<br /><br />and for all ~<br /><br />Jesus Christ (Yahushua HaMashiach) is coming back. Don't leave this world without Him...<br /><br />Gift of God<br /><br />With all the bad going on in the world, God wants us to tell everyone about His good news.<br /><br />It's so fascinating always watching everything unfold just like the Bible predicts. I am often sent emails saying to forward it to everyone on my list if I am not ashamed of Yahweh (God) and His Messiah Yahushua HaMashiach (Jesus Christ). I do not forward those emails cuz I don't trust them (I'm not computer literate either), so I am sending this to everyone on my list (along with everyone else), as God does command us (no matter what the consequence to us) to share His good news with every one of His Messiah providing us with the only good way out of this world.<br /><br />Yep, just like it says it's going to happen in the Holy Bible (no matter which version is chosen to be believed or not believed), it's gonna get beyond tragically ugly here. If we think that there's been bad stuff already happening, we ain't seen nothin yet. Pretty much (if I remember correctly, but it's in the Bible), God unleashes 7 plagues the likes of which the world has never seen nor will see again (remember Sodom and Gomorrah, Noah's Ark and the great flood, etc., etc.); God abhors sin of which we are all guilty; no matter how big or how small (even the little white lie); sin is sin to God, and the penalty for sin is eternal death and separation from God.<br /><br />The Bible also tells of the Mark of the Beast that the coming world leader (the anti-Christ) will force everyone to take (either on their right hand or forehead). If you don't take the mark you will die. The thing about that is that we are all going to die. If you take the mark though, you will be damned eternally to hell and without God.<br /><br />The good news is that God loves us so much that He provided a way for us to be with Him eternally in heaven instead of eternally dead in our sins. For those who choose to believe, repent (turn back to God), receive and follow His command (not request) to accept His only holy blood covering for our sins, Yahushua Ha Mashiach (Jesus the Christ), we will be allowed to join Him in the new heaven and new earth that God says He will replace after all that is destroyed during this tribulation period of utter horrible death and destruction.<br /><br />Whether we believe in God or not, heaven and hell or not, we all believe that we are all going to die, just like we all believe that we need air to breath even if we can't see the air, along with if we jump off a tall building, we will fall cuz of gravity, which we also can't see, etc., etc.<br /><br />The question is, will we die only once with and for God if we repented, received and followed the sin covering that God provided for us through the perfect shed blood sacrifice of His Messiah Yahushua, who beat death and hell when He rose again and thus through His shed blood covering our sins, we will be able to enter into heaven with God forever?<br /><br />Is our choice instead to reject God's Messiah and take the easy way out while we still have to live in this world along with accepting the mark of the Beast from the antiChrist that's coming (or already here) that will lead this war against Israel? God says that we cannot serve two masters; that we have to choose to live and die once for Him or live and die forever without Him. It's just sad that people would rather have the temporary comfort leading to the eternal torment of satan than the temporary trouble leading to the eternal freedom and blessings of God.<br /><br />God's Word, whether we choose to believe is real (like Him) or not (and which has been proven true and continues to do so); I believe is as true as it was yesterday, is today and will be forever (just like Him with His swift terrible justice and His immeasurable love for us all because He provided our eTicket to heaven, the sacrificed and risen Yahushua the Messiah). Will you die with God or without Him? Will you die for Him or against Him? Will you accept the bail (Yahushua HaMashiach) that He paid on your behalf to get out of satan's hell so that you can enter into His heaven?<br /><br />My prayer is that all will ask Jesus Christ (Yeshua or Yahushua the Messiah) into their heart and follow Him so that all may know God's plan for our eternal salvation (rescue from our sins and eternal separation from God in hell) through His perfect sinless sacrificial substitute for our sins, Yahushua, and know His boundless, unconditional love, light, ultimate peace, power, strength, comfort, mercy, grace, beauty, healing, hope, joy and blessings, for you are so very precious in His sight!<br /><br />It's God's way (that He says in His Holy Word is only through His Holy Son Yahushua) or the highway (straight to hell). May God have mercy on us all on our way to finding (or rejecting) and then serving Him!<br /><br />Jesus is my hope in life and my life in death.<br /><br />Please take very good care, shalom and may you find healing and eternal life in the holy name of Jesus Christ!<br /><br />Yahushua loves you!

review/summary: Delightful surprise at the airport store!
review/text: Was waiting for our airplane & wanted something healthy to snack on - to my delightful surprise, I found your product (Multigrain one), looked at all the numbers on the back of the package & was amazed how good they were; then was further amazed how good tasting they were.  To my further delight, I have now found them in my local market (Vons in California)and want to try all flavors - then I shall order from you via the internet for more savings.  Thank you so much for the people who developed this product!!  Tina in CA

review/summary: Too salty
review/text: Buffalo Chips from FoodShouldTasteGood are crispy and spicy, but they're too salty for me.  I wouldn't have ordered them if the description had included their salt content.

review/text: Oh my gosh!  Who knew a "chocolate" chip would taste so good.  The only bad part is I ate much more ice cream so I could dip them then before.

review/summary: Best Chips EVER!...and they're GOOD for you!
review/text: We found these at Costco and fell in love with them.  They're SO GOOD...and they're actually good for you.  Since I couldn't find them at Costco the past couple of times I went there, I searched online and found them on Amazon.  Funny...after I ordered them I now see them at my local grocery store chain (Ralph's)...and even on the flight I took across the country last month (United Airlines).  However, I'm still glad I ordered a big box of them because we go through them pretty fast.  :)

review/summary: Really enjoyed these!
review/text: These tortilla chips are delicious!  And they don't contain any bad oils or artificial ingredients.  I am following the Perfect 10 diet (with good success) and these fit on the diet nicely (in moderation of course... it is a starch).  Only way this could be better would be if ingredients were all organic.

review/summary: Great Multigrain Chips
review/text: It is nice to find good tasting snacks that are not loaded with salt and fat.  The multigrain are the only kind I eat regularly, but taste is a personal thing.  The price from Amazon is guite a bit lower than the grocery store too.

review/summary: OMG!!!!  Solves that craving!!
review/text: Oh, YUMMM!!<br />These are THE best chips I have tasted in years.  I am allergic to lactose, gluten, soy, mint and grapes, which has made it hard to go through these past several years craving soda crackers or something akin to them, and even trying (unsuccessfully) to come up with a workable recipe I can make for myself.  Now I have found them!  These are my newest comfort food.  Wonderful with a chilled glass of Diamond Almond Milk, and I am that little kid back in the kitchen sitting with my milk and crackers.  The texture and tender-crisp "bite-factor" (to me) is so close to that of good, old fashioned crackers - - and the flavor is just deeply satisfying.  I will be up in the middle of the night snacking on these for sure.  I cannot rave enough about them, but I see that others agree with me in the quality and "yummy-ness" quotient of these wonderful chips!  To me they taste closer to crackers than tortilla chips and that is SOOOO yummy!<br />Thank you AMZ for putting these on S&S!!!  Come next payday I will need to be getting a whole case, maybe 2!!  (Can't be running out of them.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YSRK7E">FoodShouldTasteGood Tortilla Chips, Olive, An All Natural Recipe, 6-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a><br />&<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012L8E7M">Olive Tortilla Chips</a>

review/summary: The Best Chips Ever!
review/text: I stumbled on the Multigrain chips at the little store where I work.  I love them and buy them by the box from Amazon now!  The ingredients are all words you would expect and no long chemical names you can't pronounce.  The Sweet Potato is very good too, but I did not like the Olive flavor.

review/summary: Delicious and Nutritious!
review/text: My two year old son and I have Celiac Disease. We can't have gluten, because it makes us very sick. We also both happen to have issues with dairy too. It is very nice that there are AFFORDABLE, delicious snacks like this that we can eat and enjoy. My son loves them, and so do I. The multi-grain are the only flavor we have tried, and we are sold! They are so good. I am so happy to have found these!<br /><br />Most gluten free food is very expensive. Like, Betty Crocker's (albeit delicious) gluten free chocolate cake mix is $3.50 a box, and you get half the amount of a regular Betty Crocker cake mix at 98 cents! It is nice when I find great products that taste good and are inexpensive that we can eat. I am so happy that more companies are finally making gluten free foods!
