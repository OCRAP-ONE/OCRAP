review/summary: Our new favorite breakfast food...
review/text: These are our new favorite breakfast food.  FANTASTIC!!!!  We love them, and that's even after we're on our second set of 12 boxes.  The strawberry flavoring tastes real, not fake like regular pop tarts.  Overall, the taste is sweet but not overly so.  This flavor is better than the apple cinnamon, which we have also tried.  Definitely one of our best Amazon purchases ever.

review/summary: A tasty, kosher, healthier alternative to Pop Tarts
review/text: First and foremost, these toaster pastries taste great! You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy.

review/summary: The best flavor of all!
review/text: I have tried all of the frosted flavors and by far, strawberry is the best.It has a strong strawberry flavor with a light frosting that has the perfect sweetness. And this is coming from a non-Pop Tart fan. My order of flavor preference is strawberry, maple sugar cinnamon, cherry/pomegranate, blueberry, apple cinnamon, and surprisingly last is chocolate which I thought would be my favorite.

review/summary: Guiltless Tarts
review/text: These Frosted Wildberry Acai Toaster Pastries are very tasty.  They have a strong berry flavor and a delicate crust that is slightly cruncy.<br /><br />The pinky-purple frosting is a hit with the kids.  They call them "Purple Flurp" tarts.  (From Jimmy Neutron on Nikelodeon)  And they like them!<br /><br />Real fruit, whole grains, no high fructose corn syrup and reasonably priced.  Guilt free treats for my kids (mom and dad too).

review/summary: Just Tried The Cherry Pomegranate
review/text: I've tried the Apple, Strawberry, and now the Cherry Pomegranate.  All of them are pretty good. The Cherry Pomegranate doesn't taste that much different than the strawberry.  It might have more of a berry flavor to it.  Compared to a pop tart they're not as flavorful, but they're a step in the healthy direction.  They've got enough sweet to get the job done. Make sure whichever one you buy, that you get the frosted and not the plain.  The plain is too dull without the frosting complimenting it. The only fruit flavor left for me to try now is the blueberry.

They don't last as long as opposed to the blueberry...Strawberry is delicious too. They travel pretty well too. Don't crumble too much...

The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)

review/text: I was never a pop tart fan, but on a lark and due to the coupon, I tried these. I was pleasantly surprised at how good they tasted. I would prefer more filling as you can barely taste it. The frosting is very light and adds a perfect sweetness. One package w/ coffee is a perfect quick breakfast. Since AMZ is now out of stock for this flavor, I ordered the apple frosted ones.I think the unfrosted might be too flavorless for me.

review/text: I went out and bought the frosted Strawberry.  I must say I really like them.  The first time I tried this product was in the Apple Cinnamon flavor that was not frosted.  Like some of the other posters have stated, go for the frosted.  The plain ones are ok, but the frosted ones hits the spot.<br /><br />For me it is hard to decide which is better, the Strawberry or the Apple Cinnamon.  I haven't tried the Blueberry yet, but I'm tempted to see how it tastes.

review/text: Two out of my three boys love these toaster pastries.  They are pretty healthy for them and are a great snack to throw in my bag when we are on the go.  My only suggestion would be to wrap them individually, because I only let them have one at a time, which is plenty.  Or, to eliminate unnecessary packaging, pack them without the individual wrappers in the box.

I've started to buy more and more organic products and find that many of them meet or exceed my expectations for flavor and quality.<br /><br />Nature's Path Organic Apple Cinnamon Toaster Pastries do taste "slightly" healthy, but they remind me of some nutmeg cookies I make that are also made with whole-wheat flour.<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic apple cinnamon filling (organic evaporated cane juice, organic apple juice concentrate, water, organic evaporated apples, vegetable glycerin, organic apple powder, organic corn startch, organic cinnamon, locust bean gum), organic whole-wheat flour, organic white flour, water, organic evaporated cane juice, organic palm oil, powdered organic eveaporated cane juice, organic invert syrup, salt, leavening, natural flavor, agar, tocopherols (for freshness).<br /><br />Unfortunately these do contain palm oil, although I don't seem to be as allergic to organic palm oil. Makes me wonder what I'm really allergic to, as in what is in the additional element in the non-organic Palm Kernel Oil. Could it simply be that this is the non-hydrogenated version.

review/summary: BEST TOASTER PASTRY
review/text: These are the very best of any organic or non-organic toaster pastry we have ever tried.  Cherry Pomegran is the favorite flavor in our house.  It has a real fruit taste and a real pastry taste, not like regular brand & store brands that have always left me with indigestion and a lingering unpleasant taste.  Plus they have healthier ingredients than regular brands so I can feel good about giving these one or two times a week for really quick breakfasts or on the go breakfast when necessary.  We have embraced organic foods since the mid 1990's and these are among the best.  Amazon offers a better deal  than the ones we got at retail store.  By the way, strawberry frosted is our family's second favorite flavor.  Recommend trying them.  Five stars for sure.

review/text: Every one of my children love these toaster pastries...which is hard to accomplish in this house!  I had originally purchased them from our local health food store($3.89/box) because my pickiest eater begged for them.  Obviously, I'm not going to continuously pay that much for a box of 6 toaster pastries.  So, I went on the hunt for the best price.  I purchased these through Subscribe & Save on Amazon and I get them for $2.29/box with free shipping.  That means I don't even have to go TO the store.  What a deal!  We're going to try the Wildberry Acai next...I'll let you know what we think of those!

review/text: These are a great alternative to PopTarts. I've only tried the strawberry. Crust, icing, filling - all are delicious. My only change would be to make the filling thicker. The outer edges of the crust can be a little dry without a bit of the filling to go with it so I find myself breaking off the outside edges to get to the yummy middle. Maybe I'm just picky. But otherwise, I love them!

review/summary: A Sinful Treat... With A Little Less Sin
review/text: Okay, in the grand scheme of things, if you're closely watching your calorie intake... these aren't for you. Yes, they are organic! LOVE that they are organic! But they have similar stats to their non-organic counterpart (one of these toaster pastries has 210 calories and 5g fat while the other non-organic brand's toaster pastries average the same - 210 calories and 5g fat). However, it's nice to see that the first ingredient in Nature's Path Frosted Raspberry toaster pastries is Organic Wheat Flour, while the other brand's first ingredient is enriched flour). At any rate, I picked up two different flavors of Nature's Path toaster pastries from my local Whole Foods and I haven't been able to stop eating them since. I bought the Wildberry Acai on Amazon without having tried them first, since I had yet to be disappointed by a flavor of theirs to date. While they are not my favorite flavor (the iced Raspberry and Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are beyond amazing), they definitely leave my tastebuds satisfied. I wouldn't say these are guilt-free, but I do feel less guilty knowing that they are organic!

review/summary: Not health food, but far, far better than Pop-Tarts
review/text: Making the change from a typical American diet to a healthier organic and more whole-grain centered diet is no mean feat with my 6-year-old.  I have to work hard to find products that she really likes as, with most children her age, she is hooked on the artificial, high fructose-laden junk that is aggressively marketed to kids.  I refuse to buy anything with high fructose corn syrup in it so, needless to say, Pop-Tarts are not known in my house.  When I saw these at Whole Foods, I thought we'd give them a try.<br /><br />Now, a big caveat here: this review is not meant to endorse this as a healthy breakfast.  Organic or no, it is still a treat.  That said, it is something I will allow my daughter once a week, and it is something that she really enjoys.  I'm a former chocolate Pop-Tart addict and I can honestly say that I like these even better.  The more I train my palate, the more I realize that all those foods that are chock full of artificial ingredients are actually quite disgusting.  These pastries are sweet, but not cloying so, and the chocolate in them actually tastes like chocolate.  What a concept.<br /><br />I also want to note that purchasing them through subscribe and save is a considerable savings over buying them in the grocery store.  When all is said and done, I'll have paid about a dollar a box less by ordering these through Amazon rather than buying them at Whole Foods.  I not only like to eat healthier, I also like to trim the fat from my wallet.

My husband about died when he saw I ordered a case of "Pop Tarts", but he was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the more healthful ingredients.  I will definitely keep these on my shopping list, and recommend them to anyone, especially families with children who want a quick and tasty snack that's a little more "fun" than a piece of toast and more wholesome than a donut or (most) cookies.

review/summary: Delicious toaster pastries...
review/text: All of the Nature's Path organic toaster pastries are delicious, and actually good for you, to the extent that a carb filled toaster pastry can be. The frosting amount is just right, not too little, and not too overpowering.<br /><br />As for flavor preference, here's where I stand:<br /><br />strawberry > apple cinnamon > blueberry<br /><br />(hence 4 stars for this flavor, rather than 5)

review/text: It is very hard to find organic products where I live.  I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them.  I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon.  We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next.  Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!

review/summary: A healthier version of the popular breakfast pastry...
review/text: We've been on a pomegranate kick lately and my wife saw these Organic `Toaster Pastries' (don't call them Pop-Tarts) and snatched them up the other day.  She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it.

These taste better and are better for you!They are made with REAL INGREDIENTS and I feel sorry for those who have never tried these and continue to eat the other brands. YOU ARE MISSING OUT! Its a win win situation with these. It'd be nice to buy them here, but keep in mind, other than grocery stores and health food stores I've found them at Walmart too. You can find them many places. Natures Path is one of the best organic companies too on top of that. Great to support.

review/summary: Tastes great, still like nearly candy but at least natural
review/text: I saw these at Big Lots for two bucks a box of six so I bought a few.  I'm not one to buy stuff and eat this type of sugary snack on a regular basis (or at least I refuse to see myself as someone who does), but the organic label was interesting so I gave it a try.  I suppose it helps me rationalize eating them if they are organic, because the more unhealthy and unnatural contents of the mainstream competitive products, in combination to the calories and sugar for this type of "food," is generally enough to dissuade me from buying them.<br /><br />I have eaten Pop Tarts before, and these are every bit as good and tasty or better.  I haven't eaten enough Pop Tarts to be really familar with the varieties and all that, but I think these Nature's Path Organic Toaster Pastries are not lacking in any way at all compared to my recollection of the artificial and non-organic/natural conventional products.  These were not dry or bland or stale or anything like that.  The only drawback at all I could find with them is the calories and sugar content.<br /><br />The one that I tried is the strawberry frosted style.  If I see more at Big Lots, I'll be picking up some more.

review/summary: Chocolate is excellent
review/text: First, I'd agree with everyone here who says this isn't a "healthy" food.  Because it's really not.  Lots of sugar in this.  But as a snack, it sure beats a lot of the other sugary treats out there, and it tastes good enough, that your kids won't feel deprived if you give them this instead of a twinky.  We also like that it's organic, since we have some issues with GMO foods- allergy type issues, not philosophical issues (not that there's anything wrong with philosophical issues, but ours is a true allergy).<br /><br />And if you want to be really decadent, when you go camping, you can toast marshmallows, and toast these (or not toast them) and use them to make a pretty darn good smore-like creation.

review/summary: Toaster Patries a Winner!
review/text: I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial "icks". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D

This is still plenty though.<br />Also, the expiration date was for only 5 months after I received them. So if you're ordering these, make sure they'll be eaten somewhat quickly.

review/summary: Incredibly Good; Puts Pop-Tarts to Shame
review/text: I never really ate Pop-Tarts until I was an adult.  When I tried them, I liked them well enough, I suppose, but thought they were nothing to write home about.  I bought some of these, along with the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon flavor in a combo pack, on a whim and was pleasantly surprised.  These are excellent.  Think organic, good-tasting Pop-Tarts.  Health food?  Maybe.  More healthy than the "original"?  Definitely.  But more importantly, they taste way better.<br /><br />I like this flavor better than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon.  The Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon are good, I'd give them a 4 stars even, but these are really, really good.  I like the brightness and slight tartness of these better.  I think it works better with the pastry than the Frosted Brown Sugar Maple Cinnamon which is simply rich and sugary.  I am about to get a big box of the Frosted Blueberry to try those out.<br /><br />As an aside, one of the other reviewers commented on wanting some of the sugar replaced with "natural" artificial sweetener.  I think this would be a big mistake.  They would taste terrible, and, I think, would go against the idea of having a natural version of a processed product.  I would stop buying them if that happened.  If you want less sugar, just eat one of them in a sitting. :)

I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them.  They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them.  Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big.  Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic.

review/summary: Pop Tarts - Eat your heart out!!!
review/text: I purchased a case of 12 boxes (72 delicious little treats) - of these for $15.00.  I thought that, at that price, it would be worth it, even if they weren't any better than the high fructose corn syrup filled name brand Poptarts.  And I do not regret the decision one bit!<br /><br />The calories/fat/etc are very similar to those of regular Poptarts, but the ingredients are different - sweetened with cane juice, molasses, honey, etc.  They still are pink & covered with sprinkles, in case that's what you're into.<br /><br />The taste & consistency are really what you're interested in though, right?  Well - we've got a win-win situation.  The pastry itself is quite good, similiar to the consistency of a traditional toaster pastry - (in my experience, some foods made with whole wheat flour end up being sort of like paste in my mouth when I'm chewing - but that doesn't happen at all with these) - and the filling is DIVINE - it doesn't taste like a liquified fruit roll up (which is what I think of the cherry filling in a regular poptart) - you primarily taste the cherry - but the pomegranite (or "pomegran" as it says on the box) comes through as well.<br /><br />That being said - these are definitely worth the super low price I paid for them, and in the future, I'll most likely be willing to pay more if I have to - definitely superior to the ones you'll find in my local grocery store!!

A case is a lot of toaster pastries, but we are not getting sick of them, and you can also use these for groups of kids, like after soccer games, etc.  The price is less than the local health food store, and now I don't have to make a special stop to pick them up.

review/text: So, I'm trying to be a responsible parent.  I buy these and give my kids the "It's these or nothing- no more pop-tarts" speech.<br /><br />Result- my kids eat a lot more cereal.  Even my 2 year old, who eats anything, won't eat them.<br /><br />Personally, I think they're pretty good toasted, not so hot (pun!) un-toasted.  I took 5 boxes to work, and the opinions were universally the same.<br /><br />So, if your satisfaction in eating somewhat healthier outweighs your taste buds, have at 'em!

review/summary: Delicious!  Turn Toast Into A Gourmet Treat.
review/text: It's been a very long time since I got excited about a jar of preserves, and those were always homemade, but I would put Elizabethan Pantry Cherry Preserves with Brandy up against the finest homemade preserves I've ever eaten.  I'm totally hooked on this product.<br /><br />These preserves have full cherry taste with just the right amount of tartness and the distinctive but not overpowering flavor of brandy.  If you are looking for just the right topping for your homemade scones or those warm biscuits straight out of the oven or just an ordinary slice of toast, try these cherry preserves.  It will not disappoint. Use as a topping on an ordinary bagel with cream cheese and turn a weekday breakfast into a treat.  Use it to create a glaze for a fresh berry tart. Create a fabulous pan sauce for pork chops by adding a few tablespoonfuls and a little water or chicken broth to the skillet when the chops are done and out of the pan.  Pour the sauce over the chops and, voil&agrave;, an entr&eacute;e fit for a foodie.  Once you taste Elizabethan Pantry Cherry Preserves with Brandy you'll think of dozens of ways to use it.<br /><br />On toast, with crackers and your favorite soft cheese, warmed as a topping for ice cream, turned into a pan sauce or pastry filling, Elizabethan Pantry Cherry Preserves is a genuine taste treat.

review/summary: Nice compromise of quality and cost
review/text: Rachael Ray speaks of extra virgin olive oil as EVOO. Well, EVOO is an important part of my family's diet. We use olive oil for cooking and also for salad dressing. Cento? A nice compromise between quality of the product and cost.<br /><br />For one thing, olive oil is pretty good for people. Whether as the basis for cooking or for salads, this is a nutritional asset.<br /><br />For another, it serves pretty well when you sautee meats, poultry, and fish. It doesn't smoke at reasonable cooking temperatures and it is, again, healthier than some other fats used to cook with.<br /><br />Third, Cento EVOO is a fine product--but less costly than top notch olive oils. In a very real sense, it is a nice compromise.<br /><br />Bottom line? I have been purchasing this for years and expect to continue to do so for normal cooking. On special occasions, I am willing to go for higher quality olive oil, but--for normal cooking purposes--this is perfectly fine!

review/text: Yes, I know that Coca Cola already makes a cherry product, but it's not cherry enough for me so I augment the cherry cokes I buy (2-liters) with a splash of this cherry syrup. It is great tasting, but the manufacturer has a problem with spillage. It is unusual to find a bottle that doesn't have some sticky residue on it (as if from an extra drip or two when filled). So, it's a really tasty syrup, but be prepared to wipe down every bottle to remove the stickiness.

review/summary: Great taste and Rainforest Alliance certified as a bonus!
review/text: It's been a long time since I've tried the Yuban line of coffees. I have a tendency to try a lot of different brands just because I enjoy trying new things, and the Yuban coffees haven't caught my eye in quite some time. Yuban is a "high-end" Kraft brand coffee offering, and it's always been made with 100% Arabica beans. As of mid-2006, though, Yuban is offering a new wrinkle to help recommend it to coffee consumers, Rainforest Alliance Certification.<br /><br />That's important because coffee is the world's second largest commodity after oil, worth $60 billion annually, with 25 million people growing it in 50 countries on some 30 million acres, many of them in fragile, tropical ecosystems such as rainforests. Kraft is the largest United States coffee roaster, so their commitment to this certification is a big deal. Rainforest Alliance certification requires farmers to adopt best practices and meet very rigorous criteria for conserving wildlife and improving the lives of the people who grow and harvest the beans. The Yuban line guarantees that at least 30% of the coffees that it packages come from Rainforest Alliance Certified producers.<br /><br />All very interesting and commendable, but the bottom line is "How does the coffee taste?" Well, I've made a number of pots since I've rediscovered the brand, and I must say that it performs pretty well. The grind is a little fine for my taste, but it does ok in the coffeemaker. The color is rich and dark, the aroma is inviting, and the taste is very smooth and robust. It's a good value at the price point, and I'll probably find myself buying it again. It makes a fine "everyday" wake-up call, and the environmental benefits make it even sweeter to drink. Enjoy!

I know, a fool and his money are soon parted, but this coffee can easily be found for much less. For example, I just purchased a 44oz can of Yuban last week at a well known discount clearance store for $8. I won't say the name of the store, but I will say it's a BIG store that sells LOTS of stuff. Sorry, I digress. Anyway, point is.. shop around before you buy.

review/summary: Consistently Delicious (with wide price range)
review/text: Have you ever had a great-cup-of-joe from a freshly opened can of gourmet coffee, only to wonder what happened to that 'fresh' taste as you dig deeper into the can? I have experienced this with other main stream brands but not with 'Yuban Original' coffee! I usually go through a 33oz (refrigerated) can in about 2 weeks time. For me, the last pot of coffee has always tasted as good as the first one.  There is also a unique quality to this coffee that I have a fondness for. Of course, there will always be something 'better' out there, but it's usually at a higher price. Although the coffee is consistent, it is the wide price range of this coffee that keeps me at bay with a more cautious 3 stars.<br /><br />PRICE UPDATE:<br />Having previously used "Subscribe & Save" option, I have paid as little as $11.64 (less than $0.18 / oz) and as much as $21.64 (almost $0.33 / oz) - that was before the subscription was discontinued - by Amazon. Now it's back! With the return of "Subscribe & Save" for the Yuban Original 33 oz cans, the price has dipped back into that range at $19.21 ($0.29 / oz). The price may vary but this is still a great cup, so I'm back on board . . . for now.

review/summary: For ground coffee, Yuban is one of the best
review/text: I learned of Yuban working in a fine dining restaurant in San Diego in the late 90's. We served it freshly ground and I couldn't count how many times people asked what brand it was and how they were amazed when I said, "Yuban!" Since then, I've been drinking it and have introduced it to family and friends who continue drinking it today, too. Though I have not been able to find the whole-bean version, this is the next best thing. Give it a try and I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised, especially if you happen to get it on sale for as little as about $7 (Amazon seems to have the best "regular" price that I have found, especially if you use their "Subscribe & Save" option). Bottoms up!

But, honestly, who the heck would pay the prices listed by these sellers? $75 for two 33oz cans of Yuban... seriously?! Locally, I buy the 44oz can of Yuban for $10.49 at a discount grocery or, if I'm hard up, just a litter more than $12 for a 33oz can at any of the corporate grocery stores. When I read one review stating that the price on Amazon.com was good, I thought to myself that this person either has money to burn or is just plain clueless about the cost of goods.

For years now Kraft's website FAQ specifically states that they no longer use beans from columbia in their Yuban but claim the flavor remains the same.  I personally like the flavor of columbian over any other coffee.  It is unfortunate that Kraft chose to go the go green route at the expense of flavor.  It must have been a profit lead marketing decision.  The coffee still tastes ok but is not as good as it used to be when it was 100% columbian.  I wish Amazon would correct their website.  Better yet, I wish Kraft would once again start using columbian beans in Yuban.

review/text: I love this coffee and am not always able to find it in our area.  With Amazon, I can have it shipped to my door at the same cost or less than the grocery stores.

review/summary: A good cup of coffee...everyday.
review/text: I've been on an Amazon subscription for Yuban coffee for a long time now, and I always know I can count on getting a satisfying, full-bodied, rich cup of coffee. The bonus is that I can get it for a reasonable price, as well.

review/text: I have been enjoying this coffee for 40 years. Tried others but always went back to YUBAN WHEN I could find it. Thanks to amazon  I will never have to go to another brand again because stores discontinue YUBAN. Try this coffee and you will be sold+

review/summary: It'd Be More Stars If I Could
review/text: Best coffee out there! Not sure I should be saying that because it's hard enough to find it as it is without all you savvy shoppers snapping it all up on me... but maybe if I can generate enough interest my local stores will actually start stocking it again! Smooth, very full flavor, but not overpowering like a French Roast can be sometimes.  You know you're drinking coffee tho and not some watered down crap.  Try it.
