review/text: I use this Pink Himalayan course grain salt in salt grinders because it looks great, but also I make my own homemade Herbal Salt using Rosemary, Lemon Thyme and Pink Himalayan course grain salt...tastes great and look great in the grinders and shakers.  I've very satisfied.  I plan on making up some more Herbal Salts for Christmas gifts using this Pink Himalayan salt.  Very satisfied!

review/text: The Spice Lab is a completely wonderful company!!!<br />I received my order promptly. The salt is very high quality and a beautiful pink color.<br />Due to my miscalculation, I ordered crystals that were too big for my grinder.<br />I sent a note and asked if I could exchange it for smaller crystals.<br />Customer service answered quickly and said "They were sending me a bag of smaller crystals" completely free.<br />How wonderful of them!!!<br />You don't see that very often these days. I commend Spice Lab for having such wonderful "customer service!" I am now a dedicated customer!!! Thank you Spice Lab for my quality salt!! I am going to make "Sole" and cook with it every day!!!

review/summary: SALT OF THE EARTH - Himalayan Style
review/text: Silly me, I didn't even know there was such a thing as pink Himalayan salt.  A friend actually mentioned it to me as we were discussing moving into a vegetarian life style.  So now, it's like buying a red, Ford Mustang.  It's all you see on the road or, in this case, on the shelves of the stores.<br /><br />I'm actually glad I purchased this and have stopped using regular old white salt almost totally.  The salt does seem to have a milder taste but I don't find myself using any more of it than I did with the good old "when it rains it pours" variety.<br /><br />Since ordering this from Amazon, I've managed to find some here in my little town but it is way expensive.  When you purchase this you will also need a salt grinder unless you like throwing big chunks of salt at your food.  Worth getting the two together, however, especially if you purchase a grinder with a glass container as the salt really looks attractive in a pretty, transparent grinder.  And, of course, it tastes good, too.  About it's nutritional value I admit to knowing zip.  Does salt HAVE nutritional value?  In the meantime, I give this four stars.  If I find out more about the actual food value I'll update this review.

review/summary: Another great protein drink from Mix1!
review/text: I am in love with the Mix 1 line of protein drinks.  As someone with a sensitive stomach, it has always been a challenge for me to find protein drinks that don't irritate my stomach and also taste great and have a good nutritional profile.  Mix 1 is the only brand I've found that meets all of these requirements.<br /><br />I ordered the Vanilla shake as soon as I saw that it was available on Amazon.  I really enjoy it!<br /><br />It has a very natural vanilla flavour and does not taste artificial like most vanilla-flavoured protein drinks.  It tastes like a delicious vanilla milkshake but without the heaviness of a real milkshake.  The consistency of this shake is a little bit thinner than the regular Mix 1 protein drinks that I am used to, but it is definitely not watery.  I really like it for breakfast, because in the morning I don't usually feel like downing a whole one of the regular Mix 1 protein drinks with the slightly thicker consistency...I prefer those in the afternoon.

review/text: I think this is one of the best protein shakes on the market. All natural with 15 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber, Mix 1 is light tasting and almost 'refreshing'. Great for pre or post work outs or just inbetween meals for a protein boost. Great for vegetarians and those who are soy/lacrtose intolerant. I love the vanilla one and I am a chocolate person.

review/text: Mix1 is my favorite post-recovery drink after a long run or bike ride.  I especially like the Vanilla mix1.  It goes down easy and smooth and is very refreshing.  It is a great recovery/protein drink with lots of extra vitamins, minerals & nutrients thrown in. Some protein drinks are too thick or chalky or just don't taste very good.  Mix1 is my favorite.  I know it is replenishing my body after a hard workout.

review/text: mix 1 vanilla is really great and versatile stuff.  For starters, I love that the protein source is whey and not soy.  They also use real ingredients and are locally made in Boulder, CO.  mix 1 is great as a meal replacement, meal supplement, snack, recovery drink.  Since they don't require refridgeration, I keep on in my ski bag as a apres-ski drink (I get hungry on the drive back into town and mix 1 works great).  I also do triathlons and find that mix 1 is great as a pre-race meal and doesn't upset my stomach later on while I'm racing.  Finally, mix 1 is a perfect recovery drink after a long workout.

review/summary: nutrition value, taste worth the calories
review/text: Unlike some other faux milk sports drink, Mix1 is worth the calories.<br />Pros: *Easily digestible with a good mouth feel (not sour or slimy)<br />  *The nutritional value (vitamins and minerals) makes it worth the calorie expenditure<br />  *Unlike some rival products, tastes like vanilla, not overly sweet or fake.<br />  *Haven't tried it but would probably make a good smoothie w/fresh or frozen fruit<br />Cons: *Can be pricey and hard to find<br />  *Not a vegan product because it contains milk solids--can't recommend to vegan friends<br />  *Unlike the recyclable plastic bottles the fruit Mix1 flavors come in, the tetrapaks used for the chocolate and vanilla flavors are hard to drink without a straw.<br /><br />But overall, I recommend Vanilla Mix1, especially since recently my favorite Mix1 flavor, blueberry vanilla has disappeared from the shelves.

review/summary: Very palatable and healthy food!
review/text: Right now I own 3 cats that I found outside, a good eight years ago, and I found another cat which I adopted also.  I have always fed them Eukanuba Adult Lamb&Rice dry cat food, and they truly LOVE IT!  When you first open the bag you can smell the savory aroma!  Of the 3 cats that I found outdoor and adopted, one turned out to be a Turkish Angora and the other has markings similar to that of a snow leopard, and the third cat I found out is part Egyptian mau.  I also feed a feral cat who has been living in my back yard for 10 years.  They all love this food, and even when they changed the formula of this food a few years ago, they still eat it and love it!  If you read the ingredients, it is excellently made, and a real plus for their diet!  They've been eating it for years now, and I have yet to see any of my cats turn up their nose to this food.<br /><br />The other dry foods that my cats love is Fancy Feast Gourmet Filet Mignon Flavor with Real Seafood & Shrimp Dry Cat Food and they've just started eating Eagle Pack Natural Pet Food, Indoor Formula for Cats and a cat food brand called 'Artemis'.  I haven't any problems with them eating any of these dry foods, and I've been rescuing cats for over 30 years now, and have owned as many as 7 cats at one time.  One set of kittens were born outdoor and I brought them indoors with their mother and kept them all until the day they passed on(they all lived to be close to 20 years of age) and they too ate Eukanuba lamb&rice and loved it!<br /><br />I have had foods that they turned up their nose with like 'Chicken Soup' and 'Taste of the Wild'.  The same way we humans have our likes and dislikes is the same way that these cats have their likes and dislikes.  What's good for one cat might not be good for another.  You just have to learn your cat, and see what they like and just give it to them.  While my cats are in love with Eukanuba lamb&rice, maybe your cat will also or maybe not, but it isn't fair to not try this food because of a review where the owner says that their cat doesn't like it. As previously stated, maybe your cat will not like it or maybe your cat will love it!  I've tried cat foods based on good reviews figuring that the food will automatically be a hit and sometimes it was and sometimes it wasn't!  It's all up to the cat!

review/text: This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.<br /><br />Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!

It's full of electrolytes and it does indeed have very few calories especially when you consider how it helps you rehydrate at the same time. You can drink this either cold from the refrigerator or warm from the shelf; I like it either way and actually when I drink it warm the flavor tastes even better.<br /><br />This pack comes in three flavors: fruit punch, lemon-lime and grape.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that this does have sugar (and carbs) in it; if you have concerns about sugar in your diet you should talk to your physician before drinking this.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

In fact, after a couple of pots, I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are, this is not a tea company.

review/summary: 181 Years Old, And Still The Best!
review/text: I love steak, although I don't eat it all that often anymore. When I do have a steak, though, I absolutely love the taste of A1, which brings out the best in any cut of meat. Although I am not too enthusiastic about putting it on seafood (which the label suggests as a good idea), I think it goes well with any kind of beef, and works well on chicken and turkey as well. It is an essential ingredient in many marinades, and is generally one of the most used items for meat preparation in my refrigerator.<br /><br />What many people don't realize is the long and noble history of A1, which dates to 1824. In 1824, when a king's palate reigned supreme, Henderson William Brand, chef to England's King George IV, created a sauce for King George for use on meats. King George was so impressed with it that he proclaimed it "A1," and that's how the sauce got its name.<br /><br />Beyond the history lesson, though, I think King George was correct in his gustatory proclamation: this sauce really is "A1"!

review/text: I can't believe I'm reviewing steak sauce here. But here goes. The best steaks don't need any sauce. But when you are dining on something below the sirloin cut, A1 is a mealsaver. Nothing beats it. It's also good on tenderloin, ribeye, or filet mignon,  but if the meat is top quality, you want to taste the meat, not the sauce.<br /><br />A1 is very good on hamburgers when you want a little zip. I especially like it on 95% lean ground sirloin burgers. The leaner the meat, the more you need a little something else to give it some zip. Ketchup gets the job done, but A1 is a nice detour from the ordinary.

review/summary: Outstanding Service and Quality!
review/text: I live overseas and bought this for a friend living in the USA who just had a baby recently. I wanted to make an impression by sending her and her husband a nice present but not the usual (clothing, toys, etc). I decided to go with flowers but wanted to make sure they were the very best. I reviewed other roses suppliers and found out that Spring In The Air actually cuts the roses directly from the farm in Colombia and ships them right away via FedEx, while others are just waiting for orders to come in and their inventory is sitting in a warehouse somewhere in the USA.<br /><br />With that said I was sure that my roses were going to live even longer. Probably a week or two more, compared to other roses bought at Amazon. In addition, for the price my bet was that they were going to be top quality. So I gave them a try.<br /><br />The results: they exceeded my expectations and raised the bar. Firstly their communication goes far beyond usual Amazon sellers, they keep you posted on how your order is doing (received, being processed and sent) plus they give you instructions in order to guarantee long life of the flowers (nice) and also advise on how to proceed if nobody is available to receive the roses when FedEx first attempts to do so.<br /><br />I wrote to the seller to see if I could have a change in the from-to card I initially sent in my order and they answered promptly and nicely upon my request, even on a weekend.<br /><br />Roses arrived when promised and an hour later I was receiving a phone call from my friend and her entire family saying how beautiful there roses were, how fresh they look and that they had never seen roses with that outstanding quality. I was relieved. The plan worked perfectly!<br /><br />Thank you Spring In The Air. I will surely buy from you again. Please keep up the good job, great service and outstanding roses you have.

review/text: Hypoallergenic formula was necessary for our daughter's acid reflux.<br /><br />We found out from a friend that most insurance companies will completely cover the cost of hypoallergenic formula, either by reimbursing you what you've spent on it, or if you get it as a prescription through your pediatrician. Ours did!<br /><br />Many doctors don't know this, so they don't know to give a prescription for the formula. Call your insurance company today!

When i pour it on my waffles i only need to pour it in the middle and thats enough for 1 whole waffle. So if you think this little bottle wont work for big families you would be mistaken, i use half as much as i would with the fructose added syrups.

review/text: These are the same product as the Bite-Size in the smaller blue bag except that they're longer links and vary in length.<br /><br />The ingredient list is somewhat gross as it lists specific parts of the pig.  If you can get past that, the taste is unmatched!<br /><br />The Slim-Jim ingredient list was similarly disturbing to me as Slim-Jim has, as separate ingredients "chicken" and "mechanically-separated chicken."  I don't understand why one or the other doesn't cover both.

Goes well with pasta and other spanish, italian or french dishes. Best with crackers and cheese, rice, or even eaten alone. Matches well with soda, beer, wine or any beverage for that matter. Perfect to take along during trips. They are so good, I panic whenever I run out of stock!

review/text: When we first bought these we tried to eat one and couldn't.  Looked at the ingredients and found its mostly pig hearts.  Taste is awful.  Our dog however thinks they are great so we cut them up in small pieces and hide them around for him or forage out by smell.  After about a week the contents of the bag start to mold.  Since they are for the dog, we washed them off and then store in the fridge.  Too bad we had hoped these would be good snacks for football parties etc.  Not recommended for people food.

review/summary: These used to be so much better
review/text: Oberto Cocktail Pep used to be so much better than this. I had been buying them direct from the Oberto online store for many years and I couldn't get enough. No matter what size I ordered they were always excellent.<br /><br />However, in the past few years the quality of their cocktail pep has sure gone down. They used to be very tight and snappy when you would bite into them, the outer casing of each sausage was almost totally smooth because they were packed so tightly, and they had a superior spicy flavor.<br /><br />Nowadays they are all soft and mushy with bland, often stale, flavor. I get the impression that they are cutting corners to save a buck by not stuffing each sausage casing as tightly as they once did. I believe this allows more air to permeate the meat and causes the bad flavor that many people are complaining about.<br /><br />Every year or so I get to craving those old style cocktail pep that I loved so much and I order a package hoping that they will have changed. I keep thinking, maybe I just got a bad batch last time, but every time I am disappointed all over again.

I knew something wasn't right as soon as I opened up the first bag and got a whiff. Then I read the ingredients and was shocked when I saw that they actually use pork hearts as the top ingredient. To eliminate any doubt, I tasted one.. we've been using them as expensive doggy treats ever since.

review/summary: 3 out of 4 Paws
review/text: First Impression: The friendly folks over at "Exclusively Dog" heard about my website and sent me 5 of their products to test.<br />Let me just start off by saying that I Love how sweet all of these treats taste. Dad was/is considering trying one because they look and smell so much like human cookies. Plus the ingredients are very straight forward, they are probably healthier than most the stuff Mom eats... But there in lies the problem. Dad thinks that they are too sweet for a puppy of any age. The second ingredient in almost all of them is sugar. As we all know puppies have a hard time processing sugar, and just like humans can develop diabetes.<br /><br />Conclusion: Your puppy is nearly guaranteed to LOVE the taste. However these should only be used as an occasional treat! If you were to feed your puppies these sugary sweet morsels every day, they would soon plump up. If you puppy is already overweight or does not exercise regularly, you may want to think twice. On the PRO side they are all natural, with no animal bi-products! 3 out of 4 paws, because Dad made me! If we were judging on taste alone they would be a 4.

review/summary: A perfect ghee!
review/text: This organic, grass-fed ghee embodies everything that a modern, healthful food should be. It is tasty, healthful, fresh, and lovingly produced by hand in small batches and according to ages-old methods and principles.<br /><br />I began using this ghee as a part of a transition to eating more healthy, home-cooked foods. More recently, I participated in an Ayurvedic cleanse that required that I take 1/4 cup of plain, warm ghee for several mornings straight! Though this can be an unpleasant experience with ghee of lower quality, the Pure Indian Foods ghee was truly delicious. The flavor is clean and sweet, without any of the harshness or overbearing unctuousness of other ghees (even those labelled as organic). And not a hint of rancidity, to which I'm very sensitive.<br /><br />Only unhomogenized milk is used for this ghee, which is unusual and extremely beneficial. Homogenization alters the structure of milkfats and adversely impacts their bioavailability and handling in the blood. This attention to the quality of raw materials is just one example of this company's dedication to their customers' health.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

review/summary: Tastes amazing, but a bit expensive
review/text: I tried both this brand and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand of ghee because as far as I can tell these are the two brands that are from completely grass fed cows, which I was elated to see because of the health and flavor benefits.<br /><br />I'll say that this one takes the slight edge in the taste and aroma department. It has a rich buttery smell, and it seems like they clarify it a little less because it's slightly grainy when you taste it at room temperature.<br /><br />That said, I find myself buying the Purity Farm ghee because this brand is almost twice as expensive and while it has the edge in taste, it is very very slight and not worth the big premium to me. It might be worth it if I was primarily using this at room temperature like on bread, but I usually use regular butter for that, and for cooking you really cannot tell any difference in flavor. There is also a chance I am getting ghee from different times of the year for each brand which does affect the flavor.<br /><br />So in short, amazing high quality ghee, but a bit overshadowed by the much cheaper and also amazing high quality <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046IIPMW">Purity Farm Organic Ghee, Clarified Butter, 13-Ounce</a> brand ghee.

review/summary: Sweetest I tried
review/text: I have made my own ghee and purchased various brands of ghee. I have also tried traditional Moroccan ghee "Smen" and it can be strong and tangy. I found a review of this brand on an organic/vegan website and it commented on the fresh sweetness of this ghees scent.  That review was right. This is bar none the sweetest scented butter product I have tried. Absolutely delightful. It is more expensive than other brands I have tried.  I am not sure how they process it to get this fresh sweet butter scent but I will use it in my baking when the sweet buttery scent is most noticeable. In sauteing, this delicate scent is covered by meat and or vegatable scents. If you like a "tangy" butter scent to cut through with an oregano tinge try "Smen." Zamouri spices carries it.

review/summary: If Dallas and Melissa approve - then it MUST be good!
review/text: Since shifting to a Paleo diet, I've been limiting my butter intake to nearly none at all... and to be honest, I miss it from time to time.  When I saw that the Whole9 approved this particular ghee for their Whole30 program, I was ecstatic.  I immediately ordered it and have been thrilled ever since.  The texture, the flavor, the smell - it is all so incredible!  A little bitty bit goes a very long way.  I love cooking with this, eating it on sweet potatoes, mixing it with mashed cauliflower... anywhere I would've used butter, I use this ghee instead.  It is so buttery rich delicious, I highly recommend giving it a try.  It doesn't leave my counter, it adds such great flavor to all the meals that get cooked in it.

review/summary: Very high quality ghee and a great value
review/text: Ghee is more than an indulgence. Ghee can be viewed as an essential vitamin supplement (albeit, one that tastes really good). Ghee is especially necessary in a vegetarian diet in my opinion, but it can be a healthy addition to any diet.<br /><br />Some research shows that ghee can even lower cholesterol.<br /><br />I performed an extensive survey of the top ghee products available. I compared quality and value. Ghee is so important as an addition to the diet that quality should not be sacrificed -- especially because only a very small amount of ghee needs to be used.<br /><br />The ghee comparison table can be found at this blog: [see link in comment]<br /><br />When I started this ghee comparison, I was primarily interested in finding the best value in organic ghee products. However, I learned that several of the products go well beyond just organic standards. It was a very pleasant surprise to find out that such high quality ghee products are available. It is also great to see that my two top picks are both available on Amazon.com. (Grass Fed Organic ghee is one of those top picks.)<br /><br />Because such high quality ghees are available, I focused on understanding which product is the most authentic. Some of the ghees are much more authentic than others. The information in the table (link above) reflects that fact.<br /><br />The focus of my evaluation was not gourmet cooking. It was optimum health. Therefore, I was concerned first with which ghee product is the healthiest.<br /><br />I rank Grass Fed Organic ghee as one of the very best products. Grass Fed Organic ghee is made in accord with the ancient traditions (such as phase of the moon, chanting, etc.). It is a great quality, great tasting product. And the good price makes it a great value. I highly recommend this ghee.

review/summary: Best Ghee available
review/text: This ghee is the best available -- the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful, due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass-fed butter during the spring and fall season, when the cows are eating fast-growing green grass. That last part is important -- that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth-building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables -- it can only be gotten from animal fats, organ meats, or some kinds of fermented vegetables.<br /><br />Also, apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive "butter oil" that I used to buy.<br /><br />Finally, I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day. We use it like a supplement.<br /><br />Thank you for a high quality product!

review/text: Halfway through my first jar and even though this is only the 2nd brand of ghee I've ever used, I do much prefer it to the last one which had a strange flavor.  Grass-fed is the way to go (the new buzz word for healthy,) and I am willing to pay extra for what I believe to be high quality, I just wished they offered their larger sizes via Amazon as well since that would be a better value.

review/summary: Various kinds of Ghee by Pure Foods
review/text: This company's ghee was highly recommened in a book called Cure Tooth Decay- Heal & Prevent Cavities with Nutrition, The Author, Ramiel Nagel, referred to ghee as one of the nature foods that contains a healthy and natural fat to help us rebuild tooth enamel and keep gums strong and healthy.  I purchased the ghee because I observed a cavity starting..and wanted to fix it without going to the denist & using harmful drugs.  Since I have been following a few simple suggestions in this book, the tooth enamel is rebuilding.  This book also contains other recipes and foods that can help cure and prevent cavities.<br /><br />Getting back to the ghee.  When I visited Pure Foods website, I was very pleased that they had several kinds of ghee including the regular.  For example, they have digestive ghee..which includes spices (helpful for digestion) some of which are also traditionally used to make chai tea. I love this digestive ghee because I can make regular black tea and add the digestive ghee & a little sweetner and it makes a nice chai tea.  It warms me up during the cold and dampness and another added benefit..my stools come out much smoother..and constipation is usually eiliminated completely when I use it consistently. They also have ghees for recipes with chicken, fish and stake.  I've used these other ghees in a few receipes for chicken soup, on salmon and of course, lamb stew..I enjoy it very much.  Yes, they are sold separately from the regular ghee. Oh, they also have very small sample sizes to try before purchasing a large size.

Not sure if there is a taste difference from my previous ghee but the grass-fed component does make it seem better. 4 golden brown french toasts out of 5.

review/summary: Can't live without Pure Ghee
review/text: Pure Ghee is a staple in our home. Although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without. I have tried many 'health food' store commercial brands and I have tried to make my own, but they pale in comparison. My 14yo son loves to cook eggs in ghee and is quite disappointed when we are running low and usually adds ghee to our Amazon cart. It is essential for those who follow a GAPS diet, Wise Tradition, or other 'healthy fat' lifestyle. If not, no matter. Pure Ghee tastes great on toast, popcorn and ANY Indian/Indonesian recipe and great for traveling/camping/pack-backing because it doesn't require refrigeration. Some spend on expensive coffee, great wines or cheeses, or other gourmet products, but if we had to choose Pure Ghee always comes first in our home.

With that I have given up dairy (the bane of our healthcare problems) and it was suggested I try Ghee which is virtually lactose free. I brush this on chicken breasts that I bake and sprinkle crushed raw sunflower seeds on top of and bake for an hour and thirty minutes or so. The taste of this ghee is wonderful after baking and the chicken crisps up just right. I have not used it for anything else, but I am sure I will.

This milk would then be boiled, the cream saved for buttermilk culture- then churned to extract butter and eventually boiled to make ghee! That is the only way I know authentic ghee can be made and that is exactly how this product tastes!<br />I will come back for more.... and more often!

This Ghee definitely fits both of those requirements. I had seen this specific brand receive high marks on Amazon as well as a few other sites in addition to the fact that it is produced in the US made it only better. With all of this said, this stuff is absolutely delicious. It has a wonderful nutty-butter like flavor and cooks in an excellent fashion.

review/text: Grass Fed Ghee by Pure Indian Foods is the best Ghee on the market, in my opinion. It tastes better than the rest, and is wonderful to cook with because of it's high heat capability without burning. Tastes like the butter it is made from, without the heavy milk solids.

review/summary: Ok for cooking, do NOT USE for preventing cavities
review/text: I've recently been researching the work of Dr. Price and the X-factor that high vitamin butter, combined with fermented cod liver oil, will cause teeth to re-mineralize and stop tooth decay. If this is why you want to purchase this product, DO NOT. I'm sure it's fine for ghee, but when I switched from the pricey butter oil to this, I found cavities were growing. When I switched back, they stopped growing. Again, this is great for ghee, but don't use as part of preventing/curing tooth decay as Dr. Price's research recommends.

review/summary: Amazingly yummy!
review/text: I ordered this ghee after reading Ramiel Nagel's "Cure Tooth Decay". He claims regular use of high vitamin butter oil from grass fed cows feeding on fast growing summer grass not only adds much needed vitamin A to the diet, but also adds something he calls the "Activator X Factor" or something like that, which is supposed to cause your body to remineralize your teeth. Nagel recommends a $40 jar of the oil, but this ghee seems just as good. It's organic, high in fat soluble vitamin A, and delicious. It's also from cows fed on that fast growing grass, and it has the warm yellow coloring to prove its vitamin content. It feels good to eat. Unlike regular butter, this stuff reminds my tummy of a kind of nutrition it has wanted for years but didn't know how to ask for. This is the kind of nutrition the healthy rural Swiss praised the lord for. 20 points from me! And it is way less than $40.

review/summary: One of the best Ghee products available...
review/text: I'm the kind of person who eats to live rather than living to eat.  So I give a lot of thought to what I'm eating and why.  I eat a little Ghee daily with Organic Honey, Bee Pollen, Propolis, and Royal Jelly.  I used to use the Purity Farms brand Organic Ghee, but find that this one has a much better flavor and texture.  I think this is due to it being pasture fed and non-homogenized which is probably not true for the other product.  It is a bit more expensive, but the benefits of grass fed cannot be overstated when it comes to Ghee.  The only other Ghee I would recommend is Ancient Organics which is also prepared in the traditional way, but it is a bit more expensive than this brand.  Ghee is also one of the only oils I would recommend using for cooking as it does not change its composition when heated.  A little every day can make a big difference in health over time.

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: We have been following Primal Blueprint for almost two months, and it was recommended by Mark to get grass-fed butter and ghee.  My husband and I had never had ghee, and are extremely pleased with this product!  Smells and tastes delicious, like move theater butter, and is so good for us too.  Only problem is we ran out  too fast...great product.

review/summary: Exactly as described
review/text: I originally ordered this product because of a Dr. Oz episode in which a naturalist stated Ghee could be used to cure dry noses. I know it sounds funny, but its true. Before I ordered it I did not realize what Ghee actually was. Once we received are VERY TIMELY shipment of Ghee, I put it in the kitchen cabinet and waited for a first use. My husband had run out of coconut oil, which we do most of our cooking with and so he turned to the Ghee. And we haven't turned back! The flavor is amazing and it is good for you. Particularly, I really like this seller of Ghee because it is natural and grassfed. Good work!
