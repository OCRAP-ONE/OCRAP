review/summary: Love this tea!
review/text: I usually make iced tea using the teabags and the microwave and don't add sugar. BUT, once in a while I like sweet iced tea and the Southern Sweet Tea is perfect. Not too sweet. This is the only tea I use with my Keurig.

review/summary: Good Taste for a quick brew
review/text: I was shocked how good this tea is. Now for individuals expecting sweet almost thick tea, this is not for you. The sweetness is subtle compared to homemade sweet tea, but it is definitely good enough to hit the spot. Plus if you consider the calorie count of only 70 calories, I think it is worth it. I will be purchasing this again.

review/text: The key to making and enjoying this tea is the amount of water and ice you use.I fill a 16 oz cup with ice,then I put 6 oz of water in the keurig.I have a min keurig so I have to use a coffee mug to catch the hot tea then pour it over the ice.It is worth it for a wonderful glass of iced tea.My only thing is,one cup is never enough!!lol My 10 year old daughter makes this on her own,loves it,as does my 14 year old son.If you like it a bit sweeter put a packet of pure via or splenda in the hot tea before adding to the ice.

review/text: I love Iced Tea and Sweet Tea. Unfortunately I live in Utah and its not really a popular item and most places have a pretty poor brew. Luckily I can new have some at home! I love the taste. Some of my friends from Tenessee say its not near sweet enough to be called Sweet tea, but its a quality tea taste and just the right amount of sweetness for me. I wouldnt have it any other way. I would love to see this become a subscribe and save product and be around for a long while!

review/text: I love Sweet Tea.  The Sweeter, the better for me.  This is good, it is sweet, it is drinkable...it does not have artificial sweeteners so it doesn't leave a bad aftertaste.  It doesn't have a strong lemon flavor like some teas have, which is a plus in my book.  If you want a sweetened tea, this is it.  But, if you want a super sweet tea, keep looking.

review/summary: Delicious, but prices are way off.
review/text: This is a tasty product, but not quite sweet enough for me as it comes. A spoonful of sugar makes it right, but the prices for this stuff are ridiculous.<br />The tea supply was not (to my knowledge) affected by the recent coffee shortage which raised prices across the board. This price comes out to almost 60 cents a cup and I pay less than that for Kona blend k-cups, even with the shortage. I will not be buying this product just because of that. Profit is ok, obscene profit is not. Shame on you Green Mountain!

review/text: This is not what I would call Southern sweet tea. I was raised on sweet tea and this is simply iced tea. If you are looking for something that is as sweet and sugar laden as your grandmother's tea, this is not it. It is great iced tea, put some sugar in the bottom of the cup before you brew it and it can make delicious sweet tea as well. It is a great alternative to making an entire pitcher when no one else will drink it.

review/summary: Tony the Tiger's Flakes-Always Have What it Takes!
review/text: Tony the Tiger is an iconic image toward which many people of my age (49) gravitate, as our memories are peppered with visions of  childhood mornings, lingering over bowls of Sugar Frosted Flakes.  The boisterous, jovial tiger could be seen during any cartoon show invading some child's home and declaring that "THEY"RE GREAT!" to the young innocent and his well-groomsd chums.  This particular item is an exact taste match from those days packaged in modern, vacuum sealed, plastic  "bowls."  I have initiated my third order of a pack (96 bowls) of these little marvels, as my last "stash" is rapidly diminishing.<br /><br />Each small squared-off delight contains enough precious, fresh little flakes to satiate the immediate urge for cereal without the temptation to consume more than is inherent with those big boxes and their requisite large openings. Like rectangular, lip-less mouths, those open-topped, time-tested, colorful containers silently beckon the customer to ingest more, even if to just satisfy a slight, lingering want.  The portions in these little bowls are a rational alternative to that sort of intake and the attendant  weight gain risks.<br /><br />My wife also enjoys partaking of this product, and I  warrant that her mood has been all the more positively effected by our shared slurping and gulping of said product.  I might well have reported favorably upon this food were there no other benefits than a smiling spouse and happy house, so the added benefits of good taste doubly validates my analysis.<br /><br />I would also note in conclusion that I've yet to witness one of the bowls to rupture or for the cereal to other-wise suffer contamination.  We have on at least two occasions fought off assaults  of marching legions of voracious ants bent upon wholesale raiding of provisions and generally establishing permanent bases in our kitchen.  Our counterattacks were inevitably always successful, but not without severe losses of valuable, vulnerable foods.  The Frosted Flakes in each case remained sealed and untouched.  Even mice would seem to have bypassed these little mini-safes and moved on to crack easier stores of goodies (and always to trigger that "snap" in the night that brings a primordial peace of mind in knowing, as in days of yore when pioneers stalked the woods, that the night's hunt was good).  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSCP2G">Kellogg's Frosted Flakes Bowls, 1-Ounce Bowls (Pack of 96)</a>

review/text: I read labels. I was really happy to see a dog food free of 'poultry by products' and other questionable items. The pieces are small, the taste must be good as our dog gobbles this up like candy. Since switching from another 'vet sold' pet food, our pooch's health, looks, sleep, demeanor and well everything is much much better. He is an extremely active dog and this food provides easily accessible nutrients and bulk. We live in the backwoods of Montana and now we will have to mail order it in. Even with the added expense, it's worth every dime. Simply...... THE BEST.

review/summary: Best GF Flour on Market!!
review/text: I've tested a lot of flours, including mixing my own.  Bob's tastes like lentils because he uses garbanzo bean flour in his mix (seriously, everything will end up tasting like beans).  Pamela's is okay, but a little gritty.  Most flours end up gritty because of the rice flour in them.  Beth's Flour by Gluten-Free Pantry is the BEST!  I can make any recipe from any cookbook by substituting her flour for gluten ones.  It is not gritty and actually tastes like "real" flour!  The only problem is that GF Pantry may be discontinuing it because it is becoming more difficult to find on the market.  Sad.  Please try this flour!  You won't be disappointed!

review/text: My doctor ordered me to eat heart-healthy food, saying that raisin bran is one of the best for bulk count.  He said it's a good idea to not only eat it for breakfast, but to also eat a small bowl before dinner, especially for those over the age of fifty who might tend towards constipation.  It sure beats the "prunes" of my mother's day!<br /><br />I have always liked raisin bran, and this packet of 70 individual boxes will last me a little over a month ... if I follow my doctor's advice.<br /><br />I also enjoy the convenience of Amazon's new store for staple groceries.  The only drawback I see is finding the extra storage space if I order everything to last a month.

review/summary: Raisin Bran in Small Bundles: A FRESH TREAT
review/text: I was hesitant about buying 70 (yikes!) small boxes of RAISIN BRAN because I really don't have the space for storing them.  However, I couldn't resist the AMAZON lure (thanks, AMAZON, for the shopping ease that feeds my addiction to online purchasing!).  Why, for pity's sake, would I buy itty-bitty boxes when I could get a couple of BIG boxes?<br /><br />Well, here's the reason:  FRESHNESS.  The raisins are succulent, and the flakes are crisp.  Raisin Bran has never tasted so good.<br /><br />If you struggle to get through a box of cereal before it starts to go stale, then try these little boxes of FRESH TASTE.<br /><br />I warn you, though... 70 little boxes take up a lot of space.<br /><br />And... if you're into recycling, then the over-packaging is an issue. Sorry about that.  The up-side, though, is that you won't be throwing away stale cereal anymore.

The cereal in a whole big box gets stale before he can finish it, but the only single serving size he can find in the grocery store comes in a VARIETY pack with other cereals he doesn't want.  It was a great discovery to learn that Amazon will deliver exactly what he wants right to his door.

review/summary: Warm, Fragrant and Soothing
review/text: I really like this tea.  It has a naturally sweet taste without the use of any added sweeteners.  (There are no artifical sweeteners added to this tea.  Check out the complete ingredients list shown in the Label Information area.)<br /><br />I don't find the licorice flavor to be overly strong, but you will need to like the flavor of licorice to enjoy this blend.  The hint of cinnamon, ginger and pepper adds a touch of warmth to the blend, while the orange, clove and cardamom boost the spicy sweetness of the tea.  This is now my favorite organic herbal tea and I can't wait to try the Egyptian Licorice Mint tea too.

review/summary: Great blend and not too strong
review/text: Yogi is a wonderful brand for herbal teas. I've just started working my way through their tea product line but, so far, all have been well thought out blends.<br /><br />Egyptian Licorice is comprised of licorice root, cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, cardamon seed, black pepper, and clove bud. This is not like having licorice candy so even if you don't normally like licorice flavor, I think you would like this tea as it is a blend of flavors as you can see and is very mild.<br /><br />However, box contains a warning that it is not for use while pregnant or while nursing. Licorice root does have some considerations as to over consumption in general so be sure and read up on it and be aware.<br /><br />EDIT: Nov 2010 - The Dr. OZ TV show has recently recommended Licorice Tea specifically as a great way to soothe sore throats.

review/summary: If you like black licorice....
review/text: I discovered black licorice tea several years ago and have been an addict ever since!  When my local store stopped stocking it recently, I panicked briefly but relaxed when I found it at Amazon and subscribed to it.  My first box arrived yesterday and I had to try it out right away.  It is a different brand than I am used to, but the tea is just as delicious.  Buying a case of six at a time means I can keep some at home and some at work so I will never be without.  My only complaint is that each box contains only 16 bags, but overall the price is very affordable - less than I was used to paying - so I'll just have to get used to going through a box a little faster.

My mother who is a huge tea drinker does not care for licorice but agreed to try it after I raved about it.  She did not like it at all, so I would say that you do have to like licorice to enjoy this tea.

review/summary: Nice mild exotic taste, no sweetener required...
review/text: Received my first Yogi Egyptian Licorice Herbal tea as a sample from Yogi Teas, and just loved it so had to have more.<br /><br />Found it from the local natural food store for a little while but then they said it was discontinued, and they only carried the Egyptian Mint Licorice which, in my opinion, was not nearly as good - the mint simply overpowered the licorice (although, to be fair to that product, I am not a mint-lover).  Was so very extremely pleased to find YELHT here at Amazon at such an affordable price (as long as ordering bulk and Super Saver Shipping discount applied).  Worked out to be less than Yogi tea at the big box store, and it was delivered to my door.<br /><br />This tea definitely tastes of black licorice to me, which I personally love - reminds me of fennel seed from my garden, not sure why as fennel is not one of the ingredients - only licorice root, cinnamon bark, orange peel, ginger root, cardamom seed, black pepper, and clove bud (all organic) along with tangerine flavor and cinnamon oil (all natural).  It is also already sweet - adding sweetener makes it too sweet.  I like this combination, and hope Yogi has not actually discontinued it.  If so, sad day.<br /><br />My adult daughter loves it too... she had to wait to enjoy it until after her pregnancy and after she was done breastfeeding as there is a specific warning on the box about not drinking this tea during pregnancy or while nursing.

review/summary: Great, a little warning though
review/text: I really enjoy the flavor of this tea. It's very soothing. I decided to look up the ingredients used just as precaution and found out that licorice root can be toxic if taken in large amounts, such as: stomach pain, headache, and joint stiffness. The recommended dosage that I found was no more than 2-4 grams a day. I think this tea has about 2 grams in each bag, so if you have more than two tea bags a day, you might experience some of the side effects. Other than that, this tea is great! Just remember to look up the ingredients to find recommended dosages and possible side effects.

review/text: I am so glad my market had this on sale and I tried it.  And, I love that I can order 6 boxes at once.  It is naturally sweet, so no sweeteners are needed at all and the flavor is wonderful.  For me, this is the best gift that anyone can buy me.  I just wish my local market could carry the Egyptian Licorice with Mint so that I could taste it before jumping onto Amazon and ordering 6 boxes.  I will keep looking.  For another recommendation though (especially for those of us who like our caffeine), try the Yogi green tea with blueberry (they call it "Slim Life", but I bought it for the caffeine and blueberry).

review/summary: Tasty without sugar
review/text: I first had this tea at least 6-7 years ago; it was in my friend's mom's tea collection. I was intrigued by the name and the old box--the packaging looked way cooler back then. Well, I had one cup, and then another--maybe even three while we were hanging out. I liked it a lot, obviously, but I forgot about it until a few months ago when I started getting into drinking tea instead of coffee--it just popped into my head--"hey, THAT was some REALLY good tea!"  Luckily I remembered the name and was happy to find it and ordered a 6-pack. I was even more delighted to find that it was sweet enough without any sugar or stevia or anything, thanks to the licorice--and I have a sweet tooth.  It as a nice, full flavor--certainly not just that of licorice, which sort of hits your palate as the last note. The other herbs, spices and orange flavor complement it beautifully. Highly recommended, by someone who (like most people) HATES black jelly beans--those are a poor excuse for a representation of what licorice should taste like. Enjoy this instead.

I strongly recommend that you let this tea steepe for 10 minutes to allow it to fully release the flavor and I find it is best without any food which can overwhelm its delicate taste.

review/summary: A good licorice taste, tad on the sweet side
review/text: I love licorice. I miss licorice - the candy is generally made with wheat starch, and that's verboten on my gluten-free diet. I find this tea is a wonderful substitute. It is fragrant, warming and has that thick, deep taste you expect from good licorice. The tea is high enough quality that I can get two 12 oz cups out of one bag.<br /><br />I should caveat that, while the tea itself is caffeine free, I've found licorice has a mild stimulatory effect. If you have a sensitivity to caffeine it may bother you, in which case I'd suggest one of Yogi's rooibus teas, which have a deep and robust flavor but are not stimulating.

review/summary: Product mistake made on Subscription
review/text: I received the wrong Yogi tea on my Subscribe & Save.  I received the Yogi Egyptian Licorice Mint (green box) instead of the plain Yogi Egyptian Licorice (purple box).  I used it--but please be cognizant in the future of not allowing this mistake to occur. Thanks.

review/text: Yogi brand teas are my favorite. I was excited to see this blend locally so I bought a box.  If I drink more than one cup, I feel nauseated. The taste is great, I just can't drink as much of it as I would like to.

review/summary: Egyptian Tea is not for everyone.
review/text: I wanted to write this review in response to all the other product reviews placed on this item (since it was those reviews that brought me to purchase this tea).  At the time that I ordered this tea, I never tried Egyptian licorice tea.<br />Overall, the notes and spices of the tea are enjoyable.  I love Cinnamon and that is what this tea mainly taste like.  Egyptian tea is a very sweet tea.  But it is not a sweet like sugar sweetness.  It is a very powerful artificial sweetener sweetness.  The type of sweetness that leaves that terrible aftertaste in your mouth and on the back of your throat. It is so powerful, that neither myself or my girlfriend can enjoy it.<br /><br />Due to this sweetness, my attempts to give my remaining 5 boxes away to friends have failed.  I love Yogi tea though and I suggest that if you do not enjoy artificial sweeteners, to look at other Yogi teas.  Or just buy a single box at a local grocery store to find out for yourself if you like this tea before placing an order of 6 boxes.

review/summary: Color enhancing? You've got to be kidding!
review/text: A steady diet of this caused my goldfish to lose color.  And I don't mean a little.  I mean she went from being a gorgeous red and orange to shock white.  Other goldfish in my tank also started losing colors.  After inspecting the ingredients, trying to figure out the problem, I discovered it's full of fillers, and more importantly lake colors.  A lake color will only disperse in oil, sucrose, or alcohol.  It's also the same stuff you find in your makeup.  What do you think that does to a poor fish's digestive system?  I will never buy this again.  Oh, and that color change issue with my goldfish? 1 year later, on a good frozen pure food diet, the white goldfish is still white, and the ones who lost some of their color, never did regain it.

review/summary: Fine Fish Food
review/text: The fish love it, stay healthy, live long and prosper. We have two ponds with approximately 90 total goldfish, 2" to 8" long, some plain, some fancy. We sure haven't seen any problems with "air bubbles trapped within their bodies." The fish have been living on it for over five years, so I think it's pretty good stuff.

review/summary: Good food for growing big fish
review/text: I've been feeding my goldfish TetraFin flakes for about a year.  My goldfish are not very picky eaters, but I like the fish flakes because they are colorful.  I hate to admit it, but it's true.  The flakes are large, not little crumbs, so my fish can grab a mouthful with each bite.  It makes me feel like they're satiated when done.  I live through my fish, silly me.<br /><br />The container has a little slide opening up top, which makes just a tad more convenient for feeding the fish.  It's funny how much nanoseconds count, but it's the little things in life.<br /><br />True to Tetra's claim, their fish food doesn't cloud the fish tank.  I've never had a problem with that, so I'm not sure if fish food ever clouds the tank, as long as we don't overfeed.<br /><br />My goldfish are over two years old, and they're getting big and fat.  Pretty soon, I'll need a new fish tank or maybe have to give away some fish.  I didn't think they'd ever get this big.  Thank you, Tetra.

review/summary: Let them eat lobster
review/text: Hmm, my outdoor pond goldfish like it, as well they should as this comes out to $36/lb, more than lobster.<br /><br />So, what to do? Buy and grind up fish and wheat germ and whatever else is on the label?  Nothing motivates my fish like mosquito larvae, but living amongst those evil bloodsuckers is more than I want to do.<br /><br />Oh, well, I'll just get whatever seems to be the best deal at the time and maybe the herons and egrets and racoons  will live a better life near the top of the food chain. They seem to like fish that have been fed expensive food.

review/text: I bought this injector as it looked like a good design.  However, the needle hub and syringe hub are plastic.  The needle hub cracked.  I returned the injector for a like replacement.  Today, the hub on the needle cracked again. Most discouraging when you are in the middle of the injection process.  Until needle hub and syringe are manufactured in other than plastic, I would not recommend this product.

review/summary: Santa Fe Posole Dinner Kit
review/text: Bored with our diet, we decided to try the Santa Fe Posole Dinner Kits. WOW! Delicious and simple to prepare:<br />Soak the corn overnight in a Dutch Oven pot. The following day, drain. Refill with fresh water then cook at a hard simmer for about an hour. Drain again.<br />Refill with fresh water, add boneless pork (pork butt or pork sirloin), the contents of the spice mixture packet, and the packet of chili peppers. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer for about 3 hours.<br /><br />YOUR HOME WILL SMELL HEAVENLY!<br /><br />Note: If you have children, you may want to remove the pork after cooking, shred it, then return to the pot. The chili peppers do add a "kick", but not bad. Total cost including the kit and 2 lbs. of pork; $7.00 -- will feed four very hungry adults. We enjoyed this so much, my husband told me to purchase the last six box (pack) on Amazon. Restaurant flavor... I believe you will love it too!

review/summary: Excellent Quality, Even Better Price
review/text: I had never had vanilla sugar until my wife bought me some at a very famous and very over-priced mall kitchen goods store a year or so ago.  It was great -- a very nice addition to my afternoon or evening tea.  Only problem was that it was about $16 for 8 ounces AND you had to buy three other flavors of sugar with it, making it even more ridiculously expensive.<br /><br />That's why, when I found this 3 pound jar of India Tree Vanilla Sugar here for only $26.15, I ordered it immediately.  I have never regretted it.  I'm now on my second jar, in fact.  I'm also an Amazon Prime member, so I didn't have to pay shipping, but the real advantage is that while the other vanilla sugar would have cost me around $96 for 3 pounds, this one is clearly significantly less.  And -- NOW HEAR THIS -- it really is just as good.  It's the exact same thing, just a different brand.<br /><br />Get it now!  You never know when they 'll wise up and raise the price.

review/text: I know now why this vanilla sugar was so much less money then most, the vanilla beans are not ground. There are two, whole beans in the container and if you want them ground, guess who does it? You will need a very fine spice grater, luckily I had one. I will probably need to buy even more beans because I like the vanilla flavor intense! I was quite dissapointed. :(

review/text: I had been buying a finer version of this at Penzey's but the price was prohibitive and it was almost too fine. Along comes this version. Reasonable price, great flavor, fast delivery. I read some reviews where buyers said that it didn't seem vanilla-y enough but it was plenty good enough for me and I love all things vanilla. Made vanilla ice cream with it (custard had regular vanilla added but I used this sugar instead of regular sugar) and it added the extra punch that made the ice cream above and beyond. Buy it.

review/summary: Awesome stuff!!
review/text: I just ordered my second jar of this...I'm addicted.  It's so so good.  Nice vanilla taste and just enough crunchy texture because it's crystallized sugar.  I use it on top of cereal, in my coffee and tea, on top of plain yogurt...and when I'm bad...sprinkled on buttered toast.  It would be good on cookies or lightly dusted on frosted cake or cupcakes.  So many uses for this.  I used to but similar sugar from Spices Etc. for a much higher price but they stopped using the crystallized sugar so I stopped ordering but kept looking to see if they ever brought it back. Eventually, they just dropped the item from their catalog.  Now I can buy this big jar of yummy vanilla sweet decadence.  The price may seem steep but the jar is big - it goes a long way (unless you are as addicted as I am - and really sugar isn't that high in calories if you don''t add it to fatty foods)

review/text: I bought this for Halloween and the office and I can't stop sampling.  I really didn't expect this to be as good as it is.  If you like hard candies, the assortment is just plain amazing.  There are no duds or filler candy.  Many of the more prevalent candies(like the Starlight mints) have several different flavors.  The only thing you may want to watch for is the food allergy info given on the package states:  contains Milk, Soybeans, Walnuts, and Peanuts. And, the package equipment also packages products that contain wheat and eggs.  Highly recommended!
