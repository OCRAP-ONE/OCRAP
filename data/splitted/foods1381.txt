review/summary: Busy dogs, happy owner.
review/text: I noticed some people were saying that their dogs were getting the treat out in 10 min. Make sure you put one of the hard treats in both sides of the treat ball, this makes it harder for the dog to manipulate the ball to get the treat out.

review/summary: Not everlasting
review/text: My dog, a 5 month old Irish setter/golden mix, LOVES it.  From the moment we took it out of the packing, he went to town.  I, however, am not very sold.  We decided that the treat ball would only be given to him during "special" times when he needs to be entertained.  That being said, he's only had it for 4 days during certain times and he is almost through both sides of the treat.  It isn't lasting long at all!!  Also, he was able to get the treat out once, which made me nervous, but hasn't done it since.  I'm not sure if we will keep buying the treats or not.  They aren't cheap enough to justify him going through them in less than a week.  I'm disappointed to say the least.

review/text: A friend got the Everlasting Treat ball and 2 extra refills for my 17lb. dog.  My dog is not a destructive chewer but he had chunks of the blue part torn out within 20 min. It makes me mad when I think of how much it and the replacement treats cost and now it is trash.  That is why I am writing this review.

review/text: This is a high quality coconut milk. It's smooth, maybe a little thinner than some of the canned products but I like it for that reason: it's very easy to measure for recipes without having to reblend the solid and liquid back together again. Additionally, I can't tolerate the bisulphites and gums that are often added to coconut milk in cans so Aroy-D is my preferred since they have both this pack and some cans that have no additives. Bonus: these packs are BPA-free.

review/summary: Better Stevia vs. Sweet Leaf
review/text: I bought this product for the first time 3 months ago.  I bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8WIAS">Sweet Leaf Vanilla Creme Flavored Liquid Stevia, 2-Ounce Bottle</a> 7 months ago.  My motive was to compare these products and see which one is best for me.<br /><br />I will try to be as detailed as possible.  So again I am evaluating "Now Foods: Better Stevia Original" and "Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme".<br /><br />At first, I expected Better Stevia to be what the packaging described, a better alternative to Stevia drinkers.  I expected it to be exactly what they advertised in its packaging:<br /><br />-Better tasting<br />-Just as healthy<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />To compare them, I alternated an average of 6 drops into my morning coffee everyday.<br /><br />==Taste Evaluation==<br /><br />After everyday usage of these two products and after testing them extensively; I see no -significant- difference between the two in taste.  Please do take into consideration that I did not test these by serving suggestion amount (see Suggested Serving below).<br /><br />==Ingredients==<br /><br />Now let's talk about the ingredients.  Both products claim to be made with natural ingredients.  "Now Foods Better Stevia Original" lists "water", "certified Organic Stevia extract" and "11% alcohol".  "Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"  lists "natural flavors" apart from "Stevia extract".<br /><br />Sweet Leaf has quite an advantage, since it does not list alcohol as an ingredient.<br /><br />I wanted more evidence about ingredients.  I thought that Sweet Leaf was trying to pull as fast one, by passing alcohol as a "natural flavor"; like many companies have done.<br /><br />So I visited the Sweet Leaf website and found this: "SweetLeaf Steviaï¿½ Sweetener does not use chemicals, alcohols, solvents or enzymes at any stage of the extraction and purification process."<br /><br />Bingo.  Sweet Leaf has -no alcohol-.<br /><br />==Suggested Serving and Packaging==<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" serving suggestion is 1 to 4 drops and has a split-open cap that it's very messy.  You can't count by drops, usually it spills to the body of the container.  It is very difficult to measure exactly how much you're administering.  I found that many times the bitterness was noticeable due to not knowing how much I was using.<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" serving suggestion is 5 to 8 drops and contains a dropper for easier administration of the product.  You can count exactly how many drops you're serving.  As long as you don't go beyond 7-8 drops; it should not be bitter at all.<br /><br />Final evaluation from 1 to 5.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 5<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 4<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />Suggested Serving and Packaging:<br /><br />"Now Foods Better Stevia Original" = 2<br /><br />"Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme" = 5<br /><br />All in all Sweet Leaf wins, for several reasons.  The packaging makes it very easy to serve the product properly. When I used the Sweet Leaf dropper with the Better Stevia I found that 4 drops weren't bitter.  But adding 8 drops of Better Stevia started to make my drink bitter.  So Better Stevia claims it tastes better, as long as you follow their serving suggestion.  Sweet Leaf tastes better otherwise.<br /><br />And to folks who really care about their alcohol intake for whatever reason; Sweet Leaf claims to have none.<br /><br />PS. Oh yeah just a quick note, when I ordered Better Stevia the "alcohol" was not mentioned on the title, now it is.

review/summary: This stuff is too good to be true.
review/text: Who would believe that a product that tastes like sugar, has no calories, and no weird chemicals actually exists.  Well such a product does exist and liquid Stevia is the new miracle "food."  Most of us won't touch anything with aspertame or Splenda in it.  The powdered versions of Stevia are loaded with sugars (or inulin) except they don't have to tell us that they have sugars in them because of our corrupt FDA and lobby controlled Congress.  Anyway I am amazed by this product and will be using it for the rest of the winter until I grow my own Stevia in the spring.  Buy this stuff.  You won't regret it.  Pure liquid Stevia is simply amazing and this is the cheapest version of it (on Amazon) I have found.

review/summary: This is the only sweetener I use
review/text: I've been using this stuff for about 2 years now and I love it. I've been using Stevia for almost 10 years, but I found the packets and powders were a pain to mix into a drink and didn't always dissolve easily. Finding good tasting, high quality liquid Stevia was a welcome relief. If you haven't used Stevia before, it does taste a little different than other sweetners. At first, I could drink it in iced tea or hot tea but not in coffee. Over time, as I keep reading about the chemical content and suspected risks of the artificial sweeteners, I've tried to cut way back on them and eventually switched to this brand of Stevia for my coffee as well. Now I can honestly say that all the other sweeteners taste funny to me, and this is the the only thing I actually want in my coffee. I am also now trying to cut back on diet soda for the same reason, and mixing this with a tiny spoonful of frozen concentrated orange juice, or a little orange extract makes a good tasting orange drink without all the sugar or artificial stuff. I also like that it comes in a relatively large 8oz bottle. Most of the other brands of liquid Stevia I see are half that size. I like my drinks very sweet, and I go through this stuff pretty quickly so this product is great for me. If you only use a little, this will last you a very long time.<br /><br />Only downside is that you do get some crystalazation that builds up around the the lid, but I think that's just one of the properties of Stevia. It cleans up with a little warm water and paper towel, not a huge deal.

review/summary: Best Stevia I have tried
review/text: I just received my bottle of Now brand Stevia liquid.  The timing was perfect because I had just finished a cup of tea in which I used my usual stevia and was going for a second cup when the package arrived!  So for my second cup I decided to try this stevia.  First I tried a drop of my current stevia on my tongue to see how it tastes alone.  Then I rinsed my mouth and did the same thing with the Now brand stevia.  I never had a complaint about my current stevia but I must say that the Now brand tastes better to me.  It is smooth, sweet and does not taste very different from sugar.  I am very pleased with this first cup of tea.<br /><br />Also, this is a great price...a real value.  I will agree with everyone about using the dropper from my old bottle to make it easier to judge the amount.  Will definitely be purchasing this from "Now" on!

review/summary: GREAT BARGAIN if U can take the alcohol. Tastes  about the SAME as SweetLeaf.
review/text: OK, I am a stevia user and have used many brands, powders, liquids, etc.<br /><br />ALCOHOL: Obviously, if you are on ANABUSE or are an alcoholic, you probably do not want the 10% alcohol.  Also, it seems dishonest to say "zero calories"  I am pretty sure alcohol has many calories. And that it is turned straight into SUGAR by the body.  Negligible when using 4 drops, but if you pour it in like one reviewer, you might not want this in your diet. (did you know anything less than a gram need not be listed, so anything in a one gram pack, like splenda, and shocker, TRUVIA, have some type sugar based sweetener, which you only find out about by buying a big bag!)<br /><br />FLAVOR:  I find all pure stevia is pretty similar in flavor, the difference is strength.  Adding the alcohol, it could have made it a bit different in flavor, but I only noticed the lack of strength.  Now, if you put TOO MUCH in, stevia is BITTER!  If you get the right amount, and take time to adjust, or add a small bit of sugar for flavor, I find it a wonderful tool for a sugar addict like myself. It is amazing what a tiny bit of sugar does to fool your mouth and mellow out the artificial flavor. OR honey, etc.  I personally enjoy NO STICKY SUGAR aftermouth.  I add xylitol, which kills bacteria, for a super clean mouth feeling.<br /><br />STRENGTH:  THis stuff is a great deal.  It is about (maybe a smidge weaker)the same strength of sweetleaf, which is 10 bucks for 2 oz at Whole Foods.  The strongest brand I have tried is Clear Stevia by NuNaturals, which costs 15 for 2 oz at whole foods, but is cheaper due to being double the strength.<br /><br />USE, MEASURING:  don't pour the stuff in.  it is too expensive, and it will taste BAAAD.  Pour some of the bottle into your old stevia bottle with a dropper, and use a dropper.  I find about 5-10 drops per cup is good, depending what you are sweetening. (5 for water---yes, I am really addicted)  Start small and work your way up to find your preference.<br /><br />  If you are totally unable to deal with droppers and little bottles, use a powder.  SweetLear has one with fiber in it(don't let it get wet and harden on your counter) , and others, or there is the cheap and maltodextrous Truvia.<br /><br />A good deal, and I like it, but  I WISH THEY WOULD TAKE OUT THE ALCOHOL. Seems pointless to me.

review/text: Now Foods Stevia liquid is a great sugar substitute for hot or cold drinks, or as a sweetener for strawberries, salad dressings or anything you want to sweeten up. There is no after taste, like artificial sweeteners. I use stevia because it is all natural and non carcinogenic (like sweet and low or equal). The liquid form is very convenient - just a few drops here and there (no messy packets to dissolve). This bottle from Now Foods is an excellent value and excellent quality. I believe it never hurts to take in less calories - especially when it is all natural. If you haven't tried Stevia, give it a go - you'll love it!

review/summary: Great product but it DOES have bitter aftertaste
review/text: I love stevia because it doesn't mess with my blood sugar. This particular product is wonderful because it goes a very long way (4 or 5 months worth of baking in our house) and is easily incorporated into anything (unlike some grainy powders that won't dissolve).  The taste is...well, it tastes like Stevia.  It is sweet, yes.  But it does have a bitter bite in it, too. My approach had been to use this along with a tiny touch of something like pure xylitol to lift the bitterness a bit.  It works quite well, unfortunately, the xylitol raises my blood sugar. But it may work great for you; it's worth a try.<br /><br />UPDATE: I found a French Vanilla version of this that is quite tasty and seems to help with the bitterness. Quite nice!

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: I bought this because I had heard good things about it. I was so disappointed when I finally got to try it.  It was so bitter tasting, not at all what I had expected. I started out with a very minimal amount because I had been told that it was sweeter than sugar, I had to keep adding more and even then all I could taste was the bitterness.  A few weeks later I was talking to a co-worker who also majored in chemistry etc., and she said that whether or not you like the taste depends on your chemical makeup, so some people find it very sweet and love it and others find it bitter and hate it.  Just my luck that I was in the latter crowd!! It was pricey for such a small bottle and since I can't use it, it was a complete waste of money.

review/summary: Great Snack!
review/text: I am generally not a fan of pretzels. I have tried pretzel after pretzel in all shapes and sizes to no avail. I finally stumbled upon these one day and I have been loving them ever since. They provide a nice pretzel taste without having an overpowering amount of salt. I only have two complaints about the product:<br /><br />1. Brown rice syrup as an ingredient. While it is organic, I would rather it not be in there because of a few health effects.<br /><br />2. The pretzels are coated in salt and not sea salt. Sea salt is the healthier of the two and should be recognized as such in an organic product.<br /><br />On the whole, great product.

review/summary: Tasty but Burnt and Salty
review/text: OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!

review/summary: Future of Food
review/text: Much food that is utterly worthless can be, given some diligence, reinvented in a usable form. This is a good example. A normal pretzel has no nutritive value. This has protein and fiber. Some people would argue 'I am just snacking on these, I get my nutrition from my meals.' This would be a weak argument: every time you put stuff in yer body, you want to have some mix of fat/protein/carbs. Carb only, no fiber food, is not good.<br /><br />As to spelt, not sure what that cat is talking about, these have pea flour and whole wheat flour?

review/summary: GOOD STUFF!
review/text: I like buying Paul Newman products because the profits go to his camp for ill children.  And they taste good too. These pretzels fit that bill.  And I believe the price is reasonable, as well.  It's great to eat pretzels that have a good amount of protein in them, unlike the "average" pretzel with just a bunch of carbohydrates.  All my family and friends like them too.  The only little downside, for me, is they taste a bit too salty. However, the rest of my family didn't find them too salty and thought they were just fine. They are low in fat, with 4 grams of fiber and 5 grams of protein per serving. I will definitely buy Paul Newman's Organic Pretzels again and again.

review/summary: Nice flavor, and better for you too!
review/text: I started with Newman's Own Pretzels with the Protein ones.  The Protein ones are too salty for my taste, and cause me to have sweet cravings.  The Spelt ones are awesome, with a slightly nutty flavor and just the right amount of salt.  As a person with a digestive condition, the higher fiber content is a wonderful thing.  Since Amazon sells them in bulk, these bags of pretzels are less expensive than in the stores, with normally run $2.19 a bag.  My only complaint to Newman's Own is that the bags are too small at 7 ounces.  Other than that, it's a great product!

review/text: These Pretzels are great!!  I needed an alternative to wheat and found these spelt pretzels.  I had them prior to ordering them on Amazon so I knew to expect they'd be awesome.  Several family and friends have tasted them and can't tell any difference to pretzels made with wheat.  However, I like these spelt pretzels better than your average wheat pretzel!<br /><br />I don't like too much salt and I found these pretzels average on the salt factor.  Like every other bag of pretzels, the salt does comes off and settles at the bottom of the bag which is always fine with me.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that in the ingredients list they say made with Organic Spelt and also Spelt.  While they meet the standard to label their product organic, they should use ALL Organic Spelt!

review/summary: Great source of fiber and protein--but TASTES great, too!
review/text: I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels.

review/summary: Its burned
review/text: I was excited about my high protein pretzels but when i opened and tasted it, it tasted burned. I inspected the rest of the bags in the package and they all look dark brown. I don't know if i just received a bad batch as i also ordered the spelt pretzels from Vitacost ( lower priced; not like here where the price suddenly got jacked up after being featured in Yahoo from $30 to $49!) and it tasted fine, no burnt taste.<br /><br />I am trying to return the package as i don't know what to do with 12 bags of burnt pretzels. But you can only return unopened one ( i already opened one bag) and within 7 days. After paying for the shipping fees and half refund, if ever they accepted the item for refund, its not worth the effort.<br /><br />So if you are still considering buying the Hi-Protein Pretzel, buy at your own risk.

The taste is mild, which is what I like in a pretzel (that's not chocolate covered), and they're just the right ratio of thickness and size, not like some that are so thick and dry that they stick in your throat, or so thin that you're chewing super-salty air. Plus they're actually a bit healthier than most others. Unfortunately they're also more expensive, but I'm happy to say I always get what I pay for with these.

I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk....

review/text: Simply put these are great pretzels. High roasted flavor, though my cousin said it tasted burnt, and proceeded to eat more. Very crunchy without any hint that it is fortified with soy protein. Only issue with the product is that every few bags I get several oddly shaped pretzels which are thicker and crunchier which is actually a plus in my opinion. The best part is that they're both organic AND affordable! My favorite way to eat them is to pair them with a good quality chocolate for a sweet treat.

I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon.

review/summary: Burnt taste and shelf life short or used up
review/text: I was excited about buying these in bulk at the special price Amazon was offering. However, when I received my case of 24 8 oz bags (purchased 2 sets), I was extremely disappointed to see a use by date of 1 month later.  Even more so, when I tasted them, and like a few others pointed out, they have a very distinct burnt taste.<br /><br />Pretzels last just about forever. Realizing these are organic would allow for a shorter shelf life, but the real issue is that the shelf life was used up before the sale. So, in short, these were essentially a waste of money as I had to coax people to take them away.

review/text: For Hi-Protein carb food, these pretzels are the best!  Crisp texture, and a nicely well cooked (burnt) flavor which brings out the best in a pretzel, you can't go wrong with these.  I like them better than any other pretzel I've have to date. If you think they are too salty, just rub the bag before opening and a lot of the salt falls off.  I'm on my second order :)

The expiration date was June and I got them in March and was kinda nervous, but we are down to out last 2 bags...many of our friends have enjoyed them!

review/text: Discovered these online and looked high and low for some that I would not have to buy a case.  Well I found them at Whole Foods, bought a bag - then I ended up ordering a case since I don't live near a WF & I wanted them to be my snack of choice. Anyway, my VERY picky 13 year old daughter really like them.  They really taste like pretzels not like the gluten-free/high protein ones. My only complaint, dare I say it is, they need more salt!  Even sesame seeds would be good they need a little something more.  I don't think I will order a case soon b/c that's a lot of pretzels(!) but am hoping the word gets out and health food stores close to me would start carrying them so I can buy just a bag or two.

review/summary: Ohhhhh, so that's a stick...
review/text: didn't know what the diff was between the "sticks" and the the "rods" because when I was little (yes, I really was little... a long, long time ago) I used to go to the "candy store" and buy two pretzels or pretzel sticks, not knowing that what I was really buying was a pretzel rod....live and learn...<br /><br />Anyway, once I realized that I had bought these "mini-rods" I could get on with the taste testing. Testing good. Up to the Newman standards...and there is this completely illogical belief that having the exact same calories spread over three or four pieces instead of one large pretzel is more satisfying...bonus...

review/text: Newman's Own Organic Pretzels are far better than any other pretzel I've eaten. As most probably know, any product Newman's Own produces is superior to competitor brands. My favorite Newman's Own pretzel however is their Organic Spelt Flour Pretzel. Once you eaten them, no other pretzel compares. Unfortunaly, very few retail outlets carry Newman's Own Organic Spelt Pretzels. The only stores I've been able to find them is at the Whole Foods Grocery Chain. There are not many Whole Foods around, but it worth the trip.

review/summary: I've liked every kind that I've tried
review/text: My latest purchase was the Honey Wheat variety, but I've had the Hi-Protein and Spelt varieties in the past.  I have really enjoyed all three of them.<br /><br />The Honey Wheat have a good taste and crunch.  It took me about five pretzels to get used to them as compared to "normal" pretzels, but then I really got into them.  I like the taste, but I also like the ingredients and nutrition.  The following can be found on the web, but I'm adding it here for convenience:<br /><br />Ingredients:  Organic unbleached wheat flour, organic whole wheat flour, organic honey, organic sugar, organic sunflower oil, salt, yeast, soda.<br /><br />Nutritional Facts:  Serving Size: 20 pretzels (30g), Calories per Serving: 110, Calories from fat: 10, Total Fat: 1g (saturated fat: 0g), Cholesterol: 0mg, Sodium: 180mg, Total Carbohydrates: 22g (dietary fiber: 3g, sugars: 2g), Protein: 2g<br /><br />Some typical advice - watch for sales on these!  I got the Honey Wheat 7-oz bags, 12-pack for twelve dollars in October 2010 (the price is why I decided to try them).  As of this writing, they are almost sixty dollars.  At a dollar a bag, I'll recommend them to everyone.  At five dollars a bag...all I can say is that I wouldn't pay that much for these, or any pretzel in a 7-oz bag.

review/summary: DOUBLED IN PRICE WITHIN A COUPLE OF WEEKS
review/text: The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online.

review/text: When I saw that someone had brought in some of this coffee for us at work (along with a shiny, beautiful new Keurig machine), I was pretty eager to try this, even more so after I realized that it was coffee and not a cider. (And therefore "safe" for my diet.)<br /><br />I have to say that I'm more than mildly disappointed by this. As just a regular basic cup of coffee it's not bad, but you don't really get that much of an apple or caramel flavor here, let alone a mixture of the two. It's really just the lightest of flavors, which will disappoint anyone looking for a more pronounced taste. This is very much in opposition to other Keurig cup flavors such as the pumpkin spice cup where you can really taste the spice. (I know it's by different people, but this is more to highlight that it is possible to put more flavor in the coffee.)<br /><br />I've waffled between 2-3 stars and finally settled on 3 because while the flavor is barely there, it's still a decent cup of coffee. It's just that if you're buying a whole pack of this specifically because you want the taste of an apple caramel pie without the calories, you're not really going to find this here. It's something that I wouldn't be upset to find in a pack with other coffee cups, but it's not anything that I'd go out of my way to purchase by itself.

review/text: I am very happy with the taste and texture of this gum.  Traditionally, aspartame-free gums suffer from their flavors not lasting very long.  I have tried Glee Gum and Xyloburst and I must say that I like Xyloburst much more than Glee gum!  The flavor still doesn't last as long as those poison-filled gums, but Xyloburst lasts longer than glee and I think tastes a little bit better too.  If your trying to decide which aspartame-free gum to try first, I would recommend Xyloburst! I am giving it 4 stars because someone still needs to eventually figure out how to make gum flavors last a bit longer without adding poisons.

In order to get a flavor noticeably above plain water, I need to use 2 teabags. Then it's great! In the long run, like most convenience products, it's not very economical, and you'd do better making an entire pitcher of sun tea or hot brewed tea.

review/summary: Awesome convenience product
review/text: This definitely is not as good as brewing a fresh pot of tea, but it is very convenient for on the go. I use it at work where we have a cold water cooler, and use two tea bags in a 20 oz cold cup. Works perfect, tastes good, and brews quick!

review/summary: Lipton tea, anytime, anywhere!
review/text: I have been drinking iced tea my entire life. My family came from the south, but this California girl learned to drink iced tea 24/7 year round.  When I discovered the cold brew like ten years ago, I fell in love! Not only do you not have to wait and brew tea, but put one in an ice cold bottle of water, and you dont even need the ice!<br /><br />Someone once pointed out to me that there is less caffeine in each serving of this tea, and it seems to help the tummy issues I have gotten over the years. I actually use these tea bags every day, in every glass of tea I drink. It makes the perfect serving of tea every time, and again, I dont need to fool around with actually brewing tea. This is a staple in my life, the ease of use makes it practical to put a couple in my purse that I use in restaurants, or put in a bottled water when I am out.<br /><br />One word of caution, if you put a tea bag in a glass filled with ice and water, it will take up to ten minutes to brew...so, if you are at a restaurant, get your glass of ice water first thing!<br /><br />My greatest dream, would be for Lipton to put a bit of dried lemon peel in the tea bags...now that would make the PERFECT glass of tea!!!

review/summary: Fantastic
review/text: I am completely hooked on Lipton's glass size cold brew tea bags. The small tea bags can stay in your glass of tea all day and never leak leaves like the big tea bags.  Thank you Lipton!

review/summary: I love Cold Brew Lipton Ice Tea
review/text: I love Cold Brew Lipton Ice Tea in the individual tea bags.  It's clean and refreshing. The sweetened teas leave my stomach unsettled and makes me jittery.  The individual tea bags are convenient for work, trips, camping.  I like to stick a bag in a water bottle for a walk.  Can't live without it.  Wish it came in caffeine free so I could drink it all day.

review/summary: Clod brew tea
review/text: Can't find it in stores any more and it works great for me. I can have a glass of tea any time with out having to heat water. It's fast and about 10 cents a glass as comparied to $2 at a local establishment.
