review/summary: My dog loves Cesar Grilled Chicken
review/text: I had looked for years for something that my dog would eat more than a few times. One time I checked out the Cesar Grilled Chicken and he eats it without fail. Although he will not eat any other flavor, I am happy I found the one he will eat.

review/summary: We're both happy at long last!
review/text: I have two dogs, but only one of them eats Cesar chicken "in meaty juices" (it HAS to be the "in meaty juices kind!) and she GOBBLES IT. after years of searching for a food she'll eat to enjoy, not just eat to survive, we've finally found a winner!<br /><br /> Gigi is a 9-year-old Papillon mix who is both dainty, firecely independent, and plain fierce when she's disturbed, while 1-year-old Mini-Dachshund Sophie is a happy, bouncy, and utterly addicted to attention. Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the p�t&eacute; kind, I.e. "in meaty juices" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based "in meaty juices" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft p�t&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar "in nearby juices" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have.

NOT a healthy diet for anyone interested in good nutrition for their pet. BUT...our 18+ tiny rescue mutt isn't long for this world and has taken a liking to this doggie junk food above all else. It was either cave in and buy it, or she was going to starve. But don't get your healthy young pet hooked on this slickly marketed product, designed by Mars to use up the waste products that aren't good enough for human consumption. There are much better choices that will provide better nutrition at the good pet specialty stores!

review/summary: Terrific for picky dogs
review/text: I have a 5 lb Maltese who eats more like a cat. He eats until he is full and walks away. Dry food is best, I am told but it so.... "dry". I don't want to give him human food because I'm told I shouldn't - but also because he eats so little, I want to be sure he's healthy. My solution has been to buy Cesar by the case from Amazon (auto shipment) and mix it with his dry. I buy dry food for small adult dogs, mix a scoop (1 cup?) with 1/4-1/3 container of Cesar. I mix it with a for or my hands (so he doesn't just eat the Cesar and walk away). He gets the benefit of dry food for his teeth etc and the tastiness of Cesar's wonderful flavors.

review/summary: Really does make everything taste like bacon!
review/text: Like so many others, we love bacon but must avoid it for health reasons. So when we heard of this product -- and its companion spread, Baconnaise -- we ordered every flavor made, for ourselves and for gifts to family and friends, from Amazon and from the company website.<br /><br />We weren't disappointed. Every flavor is authentically, satisfyingly "bacony". And despite the name, it's not at all salty; low-sodium versions are available, which means bacon lovers (even vegetarians) can satisfy their yearnings without the health risks associated with heavy animal fats.<br /><br />BTW, one thing we especially appreciate about Bacon Salt's makers (two high-tech guys who, over a meal, confessed that they'd always wished everything could taste like bacon, then funded their venture with $10K won on "America's Funniest Home Videos") is their "Operation Bacon Salt," in which orders shipped from the company to APO addresses sell for half-price. It's refreshing to find a firm that will not only ship to APO addresses (not all do), but will actually do something generous for our men and women who serve in the military. It's a cool (and legal) way, too, to get that lovely, bacony flavor to military personnel who serve in countries where bacon and other pork products are not permitted.<br /><br />Try all the flavors. And try the yummy Baconnaise, too; it comes in regular and "lite" versions, and lets you make a low-calorie, low-sodium, zero cholesterol BLT that will just about make any bacon-lover's day. It's also wonderful on a baked potato.<br /><br />We have no commercial interest in the company, and do (and will continue to do) most of our shopping on Amazon. We're just big fans of Bacon Salt products, happy to see their products available here.

The Peppered is my favorite as it has a nice black pepper flavor, but there really isn't a big difference in the flavors that I can tell for the other three.  I still really like it and eat all four on about everything I can think of... including popcorn.

review/summary: fair (to good) subsitute
review/text: Some reviews will tell you this is the best spice others will say this is fake tasting. To me and my bacon-loving-wife it's a fair substitute. If you use this "salt" you will get a bacon flavor and you will get a little salt. This product will give you a bacon flavor. The dishes I have used it most in is my baked potato soup. The soup turns orange, but I do get a bacon flavor without having to add bacon. This can be a good substitute when bacon is not around. It will not take the place of bacon in all cooking. The part of the bacon that adds the most flavor is the fat. This can not be mimicked. Also, one of the things bacon adds is texture.<br /><br />As I have said: good substitute. It's also a good novelty item or something for the in-laws to talk about during supper.

review/text: These add the taste of bacon to just about everything you can add them too. I don't find them over salty when used sparingly. All four of them in the sampler said "low sodium" on the front label. I guess if you add a lot to whatever you are using it on it would taste oversalted. I like it tossed into potato salad or on a fake club sandwich of turkey, tomato, lettuce and their Baconaise.

review/text: Exceptional service, I can't deny that. It took only a day to deliver.<br /><br />However, the end result is incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />Looking at the ingredients should give you pause. After sea salt, the largest proportions are garlic, paprika and onion.<br /><br />As another reviewers have said, it hardly tastes at all like bacon.<br />It's more like the dust you get at the bottom of a bag of Barbecue flavoured crisps.<br /><br />Perhaps my hopes were too high because of all the hype.<br /><br />Anybody who says a bacon imitation product tastes like bacon is talking out of their arse. They have either never tasted bacon, never tasted the product, or are paid very generously to write these reviews.<br /><br />Still, I spent $15 on half a pound of barbecue seasoning. Might as well sprinkle it on exceptionally bland food. Shame it goes stale in two years time.

It's not bad, but it's not bacon. BLT's are definately not BLT's with it. It is too salty for that. I do think it is fine to add a little flavor to your cooking but it seemed to have more salt than bacon flavor. As excited as I was to get it home to try it out, it has remained in my cabinet rarely used. I love bacon...REAL bacon...but this will do in soups and veggies.

review/summary: Bacon lover, bacon salt hater
review/text: I wish I had read the recent review by Aren Tigs before placing my order, or I might have been spared disaster. I didn't realize the first ingredients after salt were merely strong spices; instead I was excited by the reviews I had read in the past that said this tasted like real bacon or at least like facon. When I finally got my order, I tried one of each on some potato chips just to see what the flavor was like.<br /><br />Anyone who says this tastes like real bacon, or even like Bacos, has no sense of taste. If you read any review telling you this tastes anything the least bit like bacon, assure yourself that the author is not to be trusted on any food review and move on.<br /><br />It tastes like strong barbecue seasoning, nothing more. That's fine if you want barbecue salt, but that's not the name on the label. At best, there might be a very very vague hint of bacon buried underneath the overpowering influences of the onion and paprika. This was supposed to taste like bacon? Who puts garlic, paprika, or onions on bacon anyway? Shouldn't bacon salt just taste like bacon? I'm more sensitive to onions than most people, so maybe the flavor came off far worse for me than it would for someone else. Even so the flavor was not only nowhere near the mark, but for me it was outright disgusting. This didn't meet even my lowest expectations.<br /><br />Quite aside from having wasted $15 on this garbage, J&D has earned my everlasting enmity for disgracing the good name of bacon. I hope someday someone will come along who can do this concept justice, but it obviously isn't them.

review/summary: Not too bad, if you like MSG
review/text: Let me first say that I am a foodie.  I smoke my own ribs, chicken, etc and when I make brisket it smokes slow and low for at least 14 hours.  I have fresh herbs in my kitchen all year and I like to cook foods with robust flavor in styles from around the word.  I am an avid reader of Cook's Illustrated, Saveur, Bon Appetit, etc.<br /><br />While an interesting novelty, this seasoning takes more like a standard smoke flavored BBQ seasoning than actual bacon in my opinion.  What is worse is that all the flavors but the natural one contain MSG.  MSG is something I try to avoid if at all possible because isn't healthy and often gives me headaches.  The natural version of this seasoning has less flavor than the rest unfortunately, as other reviewers have noted, as that is the only one I'm willing to use.  If you love the taste of bacon I would recommend doing what professional chefs have done for years: reserve your bacon fat after cooking it and add a little as seasoning when you want the REAL taste of bacon.

Guess what the in-laws are getting for Christmas???  :o) I LOVE bacon, as does my husband and neither of us liked it.  It's loaded with MSG, so be careful.  If you want to add a bacon flavor to something, ADD BACON, there is no substitute.  If you are vegan or vegetarian - you shouldn't WANT the taste of bacon on anything, so get over it.  I really do not recommend this product.  If you REALLY want to try it, I have four barely used bottles I'll send you for the shipping cost.  I want them out of my house!

review/text: From the sparkling reviews, I expected an exceptional tasting spice.  I just got it today, and I've only tried it on popcorn and cottage cheese, and it just didn't do much for me.  I grew up putting hickory smoke salt on popcorn and the crispy bacon bits on cottage cheese, and I cannot say that I prefer this product over either of those.  It seems to take a lot of it, and it's rather coarse, which doesn't seem to cling to popcorn well (my primary reason for purchase). I recommend Kernel Season's Popcorn Seasoning (available at Walmart); a fine powdery seasoning to which you can add as much or as little salt as you like.  I know it comes in parmesan, ranch and white cheddar, but no bacon:(  Hickory smoke salt is great too.

Non-chef that I am , I have been around the kitchen long enough to know what I am working with when it comes to my favorite herbs and spices.  This brand does not measure up.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: After reading the 1st review, I thought this hot sauce is hot according to this person.  I was looking for HOT, (hot in the true sense of the word)sauce,so I decided to try it.  I feel it was a waist of my money and I actually paid $10.00 for the one I purchased.  On the first try, I had to pour 1/3 of the bottle on my rice before I actually got the taste of hot in my mouth.<br /><br />So if you are looking for HOT this is not your pepper sauce. I sure won't purchase it again.

review/text: The store where I used to purchase black licorice-covered chocolate pieces (Lakrit's brand) doesn't carry them anymore, so I was glad to find something that I thought would be comparable.  This brand, however, is not comparable in my opinion and is not of the same high quality as the Lakrit's.

review/summary: Good, but not the best I've had
review/text: I can't quite decide whether this is something I'd want to get again. It just seems that for every Van Houtte product I like, there's one that I don't. All I can say for the brand in general is that I recommend getting a sampler pack rather than lots of the individual flavors until you know which ones you do and don't like.<br /><br />Flavor-wise, I can taste the vanilla. It's a little subtle at times, almost to the point where I would've missed if it I wasn't specifically looking for it. This isn't a game killer, as I actually don't like a strong vanilla taste with my vanilla flavored items. Those wanting something more pronounced will probably be disappointed. What I do like about the vanilla is that it doesn't taste artificial (what I can taste, anyway), which makes a big difference when it comes to whether or not I'd choose to drink this if I were to buy a box with this flavor in it.<br /><br />The coffee itself isn't bad. It's neither awful nor extraordinarily good. It's firmly "in the middle". I'll say that while I wouldn't avoid this K-Cup in the future, it's not like the Kaluha K-Cups to where I'd purposely go out of my way to purchase it.

review/text: We bought the Mr. Coffee 9oz Keurig a few months ago. My mistake started there. Most of the K cups are waaaay too strong for only 9oz, for my taste. Everything always tastes burnt. This french vanilla coffee is the only stuff I like in my Keurig now. It's a mild roast, with a touch of french vanilla. So, if you like lighter roasts with a hint of flavor, you will probably like this coffee.

review/summary: One of the best k cups we've tried so far!
review/text: I really enjoy flavored coffees so when we opened the 12 pod sample pack that came with our new Keurig machine, I was excited to find a sample k cup of Van Houtte's French Vanilla. It ended up being one of the best flavors we had an opportunity to try!<br /><br />Van Houtte's French Vanilla is not quite as good as some of the french vanilla coffees I've had fresh brewed at local coffee shops, but it isn't too far off either. It's a very mild, but flavorful coffee with a smooth finish and no bitter aftertaste. I don't like extra dark coffees with lots of acidity, so of that's more your cup of tea, so to speak, this blend isn't for you.<br /><br />I will definitely be picking up more of this blend and if you're in the market for a french vanilla flavored coffee k up for your Keurig brewer, this one is an excellent choice.

review/text: I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible.  Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE!  And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.<br /><br />I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money.

Cherry Mash was always our mother's favorite in the 1950's as well as ours...we are so glad to find it at Amazon. They still make it taste just as good now as I remember. Will definitely order more...maybe next time I will even get them their very own box of 24....it sure made them happier than flowers, I can still hear the excitement in my sister's voice when she called to thank me!

review/summary: It tastes good, but it taste more like vanilla then maple syrup flavor.
review/text: When I placed the order, I thought it was a blend of Agave and Maple syrup with real vanilla.  It turns out, it is just Agave syrup that is naturally FLAVORED as Maple syrup and Vanilla.  However, it still tastes good on anything you want to use it.  I've been baking with it, making candies and serving it with homemade fritters and doughnuts and of course pancakes. Oh also made Liege waffles and used it in the batter instead of brown sugar, it turned out great.  I think Vanilla flavor is more prominent then Maple, this is why it is good for baking.

I learned right away that I have several issues with them:  (1) They have kind of an off-odor, almost like turpentine.  (2) My cats weren't impressed.  They sniffed the treats, sort of chewed on them, then walked away. (3) The treats must be refrigerated after opening, which is not a huge problem but can be inconvenient at times. Try the chicken flavor instead -- the cats love it!

review/text: My dog goes crazy for these treats!  Also, I noticed that the price fluxates, so if you are on a budget, you can check daily to see if the price goes up and down. When the price lowers, I usually order a few, as this dehydrated light-weight yummy treat does not get hard.  My dog is very old, and only has a few teeth.  Even when this product isn't fresh, my dog has no problem eating them.  This is one of the few treats that she loves.  I even keep them in the car so that she gets a treat when she's riding.  That's how fresh they stay.<br />I haven't been able to find these in the store. Only similar items, but nothing comes close. Also, if your dog is picky, don't be discouraged if you try different flavors and your dog only likes one flavor. My dog kind of goes back and forth, but always comes back to the beef.  The chicken flavor is very messy, but the beef flavor is easy to even break parts smaller without any crumbs dropping on your clothese.<br /><br />Excellent products.  Thanks Amazon!

The salmon is harder to break and tear which may mean too large of pieces for some cats.<br /><br />These do need to be refrigerated after opening so our kitty does tend to want to beg and explore at the refridgerator when we open it.
