review/summary: disappointed in flavor change and company
review/text: I ordered regular shipments for the cacao powder and drink cacao daily; the most recent batch was terribly bitter and had a burnt woody flavor and texture.  Clearly there was a change in the quality; I sent an email to the company (they;'re based in Novato, so not far away) and heard nothing back.<br /><br />Not impressed, am looking for a new brand.

review/summary: Great price and a healthy treat!!
review/text: This raw cacao powder is great! Definitely better than the cocoa can regular "cocoa powder" from the store! Cold pressed and antioxidant rich with more protein, fiber, iron, and magnesium than the can store stuff too. Alone it is bitter but all cacao and cocoa powders are.  If you are trying to skip added sugars a great "treat" is 2.5 tablespoons of this raw cacao + 1 medjool date (remove pit) + 8 oz almond milk (or coconut or whatever you prefer) + 5 almonds + handful of ice in a blender. Yum! 210 calories, 7 grams protein, 8.5 grams fiber, 13%+ DV of iron and no refined sugars but still sweet because of the medjool date. I'm going to try their mole recipe on their website. Amazon has a great price on this, especially with the subscribe and save! Highly recommend!

Yes, there is a very slight grittiness to it, but it doesn't seem to bother anybody at all so far. I have never made hot chocolate with it because I don't want to heat the product at all. I think it makes great frosting, smoothies and protein shakes, and puddings. The quality of this product is superior to anything else out there!

review/text: I've gotten into eating as natural as possible and looked into cacao powder. I have to say, the difference between raw cacao and heavily processed chocolate is night and day! I drink a cup of chocolate milk made with this powder and it's fantastic. Really strong and refreshing flavor. I have no complaints at all. Just be sure to use enough water and stir so that the powder doesn't clump.

review/summary: Makes an awesome late night "snack"
review/text: I've started to incorporate more RAW ingredients into my diet, and stumbled upon this.  You get a LOT of powder, which I'm quite happy with (hopefully I can consume it all before it goes bad).  It doesn't mix incredibly well with liquids, but for anyone with a magic bullet (or equivalent) it works wonders.  It mixes everything up and aerates the liquid to make the chocolate shake creamy.  I usually use a spoonful of this with unsweetened almond milk, and I add either stevia or agave to sweeten it up.. otherwise it takes like unsweetened chocolate (which I do not like the taste of).<br /><br />All in all I'm quite satisfied with the price, quantity, and taste!

review/text: I've been using this cacao in my post-workout smoothies since it arrived last week, and it is great. Lots of flavor! And aroma--it practically wafts its way out of the bag. I haven't baked with it, yet, but plan on replacing ordinary cocoa with this stuff wherever I can. It's not obscenely expensive, compared to many other high-end cocoas, and I love that it's organic and raw.

review/text: Great product. Its nice to be able to add this nutrient rich food to my diet without anything in it like the conventional chocolates which I have stopped buying altogether. I eat it for its health benefits and of course I do enjoy how cacao makes me feel. Here it is and it's fabulous. My favorite ways to use it are making raw chocolate ice cream, and mixing one part powder to 1 part sage honey to make a chocolate sauce/syrup that has a bit of a marshmallow texture. Makes great chocolate milk, topping, snack.

review/text: Finally, I tried my raw vegan diet for all of 17 days - it wasn't easy but it was going to be done. And then I bought the raw cacao powder for some desserts. Have to admit, the dessert with banana and the powder didn't come out great but it's because I am not crazy about bananas. Instead, the one we made with figs and almonds, YUM! We have been using the raw cacao powder with that recipe just by putting it in a simple food processor. The powder is delicious. It is chocolatey but not overwhelming and not too sweet or too bitter, it is really perfect. And I love that it's RAW! YUM!

review/text: I  recieved the Navitis Cocao Power, it came in the form of a powder and it was very rich and very fine and it dissolves quite well in liquid. I like the flavor very much. Ican tell it comes from the criollo variety. I like to use it in my french press coffee mug it makes a very rich ice cold alternatives to coffee. the good thing about it is it so fine that you can even steep it cold water so  you can keep all of the nutrients instead of heating up. sure it's a little bit expensive but a little bit goes a long way I just use a teaspoon in a 8 ounce glass of water and is flavors of very well. I am very happy with this product I would recommend it to anyone it's also good in baked goods.

I love chocolate, but this is the "real" thing, where a little goes a long way to make that flavor. It has more protein than fat, along with magnesium and a few other goodies.<br /><br />BTW, Stevia is another one of the healthy ingredients I use, and heartily recommend. As a Sweet'n'Low freak, it's just amazing how good Stevia (low or no calorie natural sweetener) tastes! I bought it here too, but no place to review it!?

review/text: I was concerned that this less processed cocoa powder would be bitter, but it is actually quite mild in flavor, at least the way I use it.  I mix it into plain yoghurt along with some artificial sweetener.  I like it as least as much as the regular Hershey's cocoa that I used previously.  It is not as finely ground and is a little gritty, but I do not mind this.  In fact this is an advantage because it stays put when I mix it whereas the fine powder of the Hershey's tends to escape to the counter top.

I add the powder to my smoothie every day for the antioxidant benefit as well as being a natural stimulant which is more subtle and longer lasting than caffeine.<br /><br />I bought the nibs too as they provide a great crunch (to smoothies or raw) and all the benefits of cacao powder however with slightly lower efficacy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cacao powder (and the nibs) as a great and tasty addition to your diet.<br /><br />These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA, but this is an amazon review, don't take it too seriously folks.

review/summary: Really dark and tasty
review/text: For the past few years, I've been buying either Hershey's or Trader Joe's cocoa powder, but I recently decided to splurge on the Nativas brand.  All of the Nativas products I've tried have been of excellent quality, and this one is no exception.  It's a dark, rich cacao powder, and the taste makes a noticeable difference in everything I've used it in.  It's pricey, but makes your food taste much better, plus the raw and organic nature of it makes it something that I don't mind spending a little more money on.

review/summary: Very strong, pure cacao.
review/text: I use this cacao powder in my coffee in the mornings. I have to be careful not to use too much or it won't dissolve, but otherwise it works and tastes great. I have also used it in place of regular cocoa for baking brownies and they turned out very rich and chocolatey. This is definitely not the same as Hershey's cocoa powder- not for the faint of heart. Also very rich in nutrients like iron and magnesium, which is why I switched.

review/text: Upside: it doesnt hav ea bunch of garbage in it like regular choco (Hershey, Ghirrardelli).<br /><br />Downside: It doesn't taste like the chocolate that most americans are used to... not incredibly sweet and fortified with cane sugar.<br /><br />which is OK with me!<br /><br />Hershey's "Natural" blend is not that bad, but this choco tastes better and is always more fresh. It is worth the difference in price, especially if you buy at the subscription rate.

review/text: I've been using this raw organic cacao powder regularly for several months now.  The quality and taste are excellent! Granted, it's much more expensive than regular baking cocoa, but for the nutritional benefits, it's well worth it.  I use it every morning in my smoothie, along with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004O2EN44">Amazing Grass - Chocolate GREEN Super Food 17 oz</a>, organic frozen fruit, and organic milk or almond milk. The combination makes a healthy, delicious breakfast smoothie!  I highly recommend it!

I first mixed one teaspoon with organic raw local honey, but that was too sweet for me.Now, i am using by mixing one spoon of this powder in one cup of boiled water without mixing any sweetener. My wife is drinking by mixing in warm almond milk. I am surprised to see single stars for this product just because the taste is not good to them. That is the taste of the original cocoa powder, what the company can do about it.

review/summary: SIMPLY THE BEST!
review/text: Store mixes are just OK. My mother always made cakes from scratch and frosting. This cake mix tastes like homemade and we love them ...all of them. I am so excited to try the new ones coming out.<br /><br />Since I discovered these we have cupcakes in our house all the time. (No we are not fat)  One cupcake is equivalent to 1/2 piece cake.  I deplore store bought frosting in the can, always have.  This frosting takes homemade. Do yourself a big favor and use REAL butter in the frosting instead of the artificial stuff.  Makes all the difference in the world. Tastes just like Mom's.<br /><br />Kids will love the dots inside the cake. They show up well s long as you do not over beat the batter. The sprinkles for the frosting being all natural, are a real plus. You don't have to buy your own to add. It is just a thing with me, I have to have sprinkles on my cupcakes!<br /><br /> Side note, my Mom's dad was a farmer and they always ate lots of  butter and whole milk. My dad's dad was  farmer and ditto.  9 kids in mom's family and 4 in dad's. Of the total 13 kids, 3 have died and all were over 80. The remaining children are still alive are in  their late 80's and  90's. It appears Butter and  whole milk have not had a negative affect on them.<br /><br />Great cake mix and frosting mix. All natural and that is a wonderful thing.<br /><br />For those of you who have said the mix is not sweet enough, you can always add a little sugar! I think it is fine but have added extra sugar at times.

It is nice that it is made with whole wheat flour and real sugar instead of all the crap that's in other cake mixes. Very impressed, and so were ALL the guests. Thats what my son has requested to make this week. Thanks for making such a great cake mix! I will never buy any other brand again.

review/summary: A VERY VERSITILE PRODUCT HERE.  ITs the only way my wife can get me to eat some of my veggies
review/text: When all is said and done, this is a pretty good price here on Amazon for this soup.  I can find it for less when I buy it on sale but am not always lucky enough to find it when I want or need it.  I have Amazon Prime so the shipping cost really is not a factor in this case.<br /><br />This is excellent soup, has 0 trans fat per serving and has been designated as one of Campbell's "Heart Healthy" soups (for what ever that is worth...sounds good anyway).  Do watch the Sodium though.  We are talking 650mg or 27% here.  This of course is part of what you get with the majority of canned soups.  It is rather high (500mg) in potassium though, which in my case is a good thing.<br /><br />Now I seldom set down and open a can of this stuff just to eat a bowl of cheese soup; not of course that there is anything wrong in that, but that simply is not the purpose for which I use it.  I do use this stuff over a very wide range in my cooking.  It is fast, relatively inexpensive and extremely versatile.  I heat a can of this soup to add to various vegetables (I am a big kid and am not overly fond of eating my veggies...there is know way I am going to touch just plane broccoli or brussel sprouts with out something on them).  I prepare several types of dips using this soup as one of the ingredients and as a matter of fact use it as an ingredient is a couple of soups I make...potato soup leading the list.  I have even been known to dribble a bit of this stuff into a mess of chili I make; not all the time, but sometimes I like to give it just a quirky bit of flavor boost.<br /><br />I also like the pop-top opening system on this as I am not overly fond of using can openers.<br /><br />I suppose on thing you might consider when purchasing this soup by the case though is how much of the stuff you are going to use over the next 12 or so months.  I know several families who go through can after can of this stuff but on the other hand I know families that may use three cans per year.<br /><br />This is a very useful product.  I use it a lot.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks

Of course, it's hard to tell who was faulty here, but I won't stop buying the soup. A good deal!

review/summary: World's Tastiest Choking Hazard Around
review/text: When M&M's first hit the scene, I confess to being skeptical about them. THey were just glorified Smarties as far as I was concerned. Then someone at M&M's had a stroke of genius: add peanuts to them! At that moment something special was born: the world's most delicious and heavenly choking hazard.<br /><br />Being a bit bigger than your average M&M, they take a bit more effort to swallow whole, so that is not a reccommended approach when eating them. I have given up trying to wolf them down for that reason.<br /><br />You would think peanuts and chocolate would be a over-done idea. Probably right. But there is something about these coloured little ovals of pleasure. I can easily knock off a whole bag on my own, (that's right: I do not share!). Just give me a few minutes alone with it.<br /><br />For snack, (or a balanced meal in it's own right), Peanut M&M's are about the best there is.

review/text: I started drinking Yerba Mate about 4 years ago.  I used to only drink it terer&eacute; (cold) but I was shown a couple of hot preparations with milk and sugar that I really like so now I do it both ways; Hot in the winter and cold the rest of the time.<br /><br />I have tried about 10 different brands.  Amazingly they all taste a bit different. Rosamonte is actually a very popular brand in parts of South America but it was not a favorite of mine.  It felt like no matter how it was prepared it just ended up being more bland than other brands.<br /><br />Yerba Mate is a wonderful substitute for coffee or soda.  It makes me feel good and gives me energy but doesn't spike me up and down like regular caffeine.  My soda intake has gone to almost zero since I discovered this stuff.<br /><br />It is a bit of an acquired taste but I recommend trying it both hot and cold with the different methods available so you can experience the full spectrum of taste that is possible!

review/text: If you've ever peeled and cut whole mangos you'll appreciate this can of delicious prepared mangos.  There has to be 2 or 3 whole mangos per can.  If they would use the natural mango juice instead of light sugary syrup they would have a HIT on their hands.  Still, even with the high sugar content, these canned mangos are terrific as a cake or ice cream topping or even just by themselves.  I will be buying this product again when it's in stock and on sale again.  If you like mangos and can tolerate some added sugar, I highly recommend this canned fruit.  Roland does a nice job with their fruits but stay away from their vegetables.

review/summary: Look Good but Mushy
review/text: I love mangoes.  One of my favorite fruits.  But fresh mango is expensive in the U.S. and also seasonal. I love mango that is sweet and a teeny, tiny bit of tartness. I bought this item thinking that canned mangoes would let me have mangoes during the off-season.  But I am disappointed with this one. I agree with one reviewer that the mango is mushy.  It has been overprocessed to the point that there is no characteristic taste or flavor of mango at all. Even if you try making a milkshake out of this mango, you wouldn't recognize that it has mango flavor.  The texture is horrible.  It is better to go for the canned peaches from your local store instead (I haven't tried Roland's canned peaches). At least canned peaches have good texture and flavor. The taste of this mango is just plain, flat sweetness from the syrup. They look good but don't taste as good as they look. Somehow, they have good fresh mangoes to start with but they need to reformulate the canning process to preserve the distinctive taste and flavor of fresh mango, and while they are at it, they might as well make a no-sugar added version as well.

review/summary: Great tasting Mangos
review/text: These canned mangos taste so close to fresh ones that my grandchildren and husband sometimes prefer them rather than taking a chance that the fresh mangos from the store are actually ripe.  Wonderful quality.

review/text: I purchased a case of these based on an Amazon review. I can does not even contain 1 average mango. They are mushy, pick them up with your fingers and they fall apart. Fresh is a cheaper way to go. For convenience consider dried.

review/summary: Amazing!
review/text: I love Starbucks coffee and drink nothing but the dark blends. This is one of, if not my absolute favorite Starbucks coffee blend! Wish this was in the year round rotation, it would definitely be one of my "go-to" coffees.<br /><br />This blend was originally a "one-off" anniversary tribute blend coffee in 2011. Starbucks decided to bring it back for a limited time in 2012. It is bold, flavorful, unique, and addicting. Hope they decide to bring this coffee back again in the future.

review/summary: Great taste ... Black & Orange Round-Up Lollipop
review/text: This is a lollipop that has flavor (orange) throughout and quite yummy!  It tastes different, less artificial, than other lollipops and that is what made us order more than once!<br /><br />High school colors are orange and black so used this first for graduation party (having the lollipops fanned out) and then just for special occasion (birthday) or celebrations (sports banquets, etc.).<br /><br />Loss of one star: Part of the lollipop goes over the top of the stick and that is the easiest part to eat, the rest is swirled around a stick that is a small diameter dowel stick. It was a bit of a drawback that part was swirled around this hard stick and you had to try and lick it off or bite it off--you end up leaving little pieces of it on the stick. Would have loved to have had a softer stick that had a bit of give to it or even had a round lollipop that had the majority of it off of the stick. The stick part probably means that this is not for preschoolers.<br /><br />But yummy flavor and thinking of ordering more!

review/summary: Perfect Christmas Gift for Clients
review/text: I just ordered eight (8) baskets - yes, really - and sent them to 8 different clients for Christmas. There are so many unhealthy gift basket options (candy, cookies, popcorn, snacks) that I thought this might stand out from the crowd and be a nice change of pace. So far the baskets have arrived faster than expected - and I took advantage of the FREE SHIPPING offer - and the feedback has been terrific. "Golden State Fruit" is smart to sell their baskets on Amazon. I am a HUGE Amazon fan, including a Prime Membership. The picture looked beautiful, the reviews were all 5 stars, and they offered Free Shipping. That's all I needed to take the plunge and drop close to $400 with this company. I'll follow up if anything changes, but for now I am very pleased with my decision.

review/summary: Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!
review/text: "Bounty" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them "over the counter" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.<br /><br />Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!<br /><br />Theo.

review/summary: Makes a decent diet cola
review/text: I have an iSi Twist and Sparkle Beverage Carbonating System and wanted to make a diet cola.  Most diet cola syrups on the market for home users use splenda and/or acesulfame K which I don't like the taste of.  I'm used to and prefer the aftertaste of aspartame or saccharine.  This was the only extract I could find that was unsweetened so I could try my own sweeteners.  I ordered the cola flavor from Jack's Country Store here on Amazon.<br /><br />I tried making the soda with both erythritol and saccharine (sugar twin).  I couldn't get the sweetness right with erythritol, but the Sugar Twin worked fine.  The extract flavor is between a cola and a rootbeer flavor.  I used the following mix: 3.5 cups water + 1 tsp cola extract + 1/4 cup Sugar Twin (if using erythritol use closer to 1/2 cup) and optionally, juice of a lime to boost the acidity and push the flavor closer to a cola and away from rootbeer.  You could also use a bit less extract and sugar twin, I like it a bit strong.

Try the Sarsaparilla or Birch Beer mix if you want a different old-fashioned variety. This stuff is great for flavoring homemade ice cream too.
