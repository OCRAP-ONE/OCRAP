review/summary: Sweet & refreshing
review/text: I was hesitant to try this because it has aspartame and I don't usually care for any drink that contains it. The idea of caffeine lured me to try it. I'm glad I did! I don't taste the artificial sweetener at all. The caffeine is a bonus for anyone trying to cut coffee or soda from their diet. It also contains B12. This is a very sweet drink, almost juice like. I added a packet to a 16 oz. bottle of water. Definitely will buy more this!

review/summary: Great cookies at an amazing price !
review/text: I love these cookies. I have not been able to find them since I moved here. They are the perfect size for a quick snack or in my case ~ breakfast. They are very fresh. I am not an expiration date decoder but I know freshness when I taste it. They are not too sweet which is something that ruins perfectly cookies in my opinion. As good as the strawberry are, the boysenberry are even better. At $ .37 a package this is a heck of a deal. The boysenberry as a few dollars more but well worth it. Especially for Prime members. I used to buy these for $1 from the work vending machine in 1999.

review/summary: Another great product from Knott's BF
review/text: I ordered the Boysenberry Shortbread cookies from here.  And I've tried to raspberry from my local grocery store, but they stopped carrying them.  Both were awesome.  They are small, so they make for a great light snack.  The shortbread is perfect to me; it isn't overly sweet or overly buttery.  The only thing I wish Knott's would change, would be the amount of the fruit center.  I know the cookie is small, but I think if the fruit center were larger, it would balance out the cookie nicer.  Plus, without each cookie being individually wrapped, the shortbread crumbles & sticks right to the fruit center, so it covers up the taste even more.  To me that would make it perfect, but as is I'd still highly recommend these to anyone.

review/summary: Fantastic protein drink!
review/text: All of the CalNaturale Svelte protein drinks are good.  The Cappucino flavor is actually great.  But the chai flavor is absolutely fantastic.  It reminds me of the iced soy chais that I used to buy at Starbucks.  I don't buy them there anymore now that I can drink these instead.  You obviously have to be a fan of the chai flavor - a little spice behind the sweet - but if you are then YUM.  I only knocked off one star because I tried to buy a case of these from Amazon last week and the case was $42 - but only the chai flavor had such an inflated price.  I came back to check this week and it's $30.  It annoys me that there is such wild fluctuation in the price - particularly when just one flavor is affected by it.  It makes no sense.

review/summary: A delicious treat
review/text: Well, since some other user decided they'd paste their review on to each flavor allow me to give my short but sweet review:<br /><br />MiO is delicious. I like that I can just put in the tiniest of splashes in my drink and just have a hint of flavor... or splash a lot in and get a real flavorful experience. It's a quick and easy thing to use. It's also fun to watch it splash into the water. I've also found it's good to flavor different types of alcohol.<br /><br />In regards to the criticism by other reviewers for it containing propylene glycol - don't be in a panic like them. propylene glycol is harmless unless ingest massive quantities of it. Using a canard like "it's considered harmful to pets so humans shouldn't ingest it!" is just alarmist behavior. Chocolate is harmful to dogs. Better not eat that then!<br /><br />Lastly, in regards to it having so many "food colorings" - well, if you don't like anything that flavors your water to have anything artificial in it, squeeze a lemon into it. Put a dash of sugar. Or just drink the water plain. You know what you're getting into when you buy this stuff.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is my new favorite drink flavoring. I will be buying from them again and again.

review/summary: Delicious!
review/text: This stuff is great. I'm on a diet that includes superhydration - meaning I drink 5-6 liters of water a day - and anything to make that easier is worth it! Aspartame is a migraine trigger for me so I am always on the lookout for alternative low calorie water flavorings and this truly fits the bill. As for the chemical haters, if you don't want it in your body, don't put it there! I don't believe this is any more dangerous than the preservatives and additives you'd find in a bag of chips. Most things are OK in moderation and if that thing helps you drink more healthy water without a bunch of sugar and caffeine, consider it a blessing. And if you do find out that you have a negative reaction to any of the ingredients, like me to aspartame, just stop using it.<br /><br />Now, on to the review. I've tried this (strawberry watermelon) and the berry pomegranate flavor. This one gets 5 stars on flavor; berry gets 4. Both have a little aftertaste that's kind of sticky sweet and noticeable but not unpleasant. The berry flavor tastes a little grapey to me and it's just a personal preference that I don't like it as much. I bought mine on sale at Target for less than they are listed here, but even for the Amazon price I think they are worth it even if you add more than 1/24th of the bottle to your drink. Consider the powdered drink flavorings that come in single-serve packs and are priced comparably. Less servings, more waste packaging, no customization of flavor intensity. MIO is the clear winner. Five stars on value!<br /><br />My only improvement would be to have less or different dye in the product. I don't care if my drink is hot pink or purple but the first time I used it, I got a couple of drops on my countertop and it left a stain that was a pain in the you-know-what to get out. I'm guessing that it wouldn't come out of clothes, either. Just keep that in mind and be careful.<br /><br />If you're curious about MIO, I would suggest you go to your grocery store, buy one, and try it. If you love it, come here and get a case! It's a neat, novel idea and I hope it sticks around because I'm a big fan.

Like any other flavor, some we like better than others as it is a matter of personal preference... but all of them were good.  We really like all but the Fruit Punch and will cycle through all the other remaining flavors again and again.<br /><br />Kraft Foods are not claiming they have invented a new major food group here, it is water flavoring.  They came through with that just fine.  Unscrew the cap, squirt into the bottle, replace the cap and shake.  Can't get any easier than that.  Using tap water is fine too.<br /><br />As for the guy whining about "chemicals", everything we eat contains "chemicals".  Get over it.

review/summary: A Suggestion For My Fellow Cheapskates.
review/text: A few months ago I picked up a small container of MiO Liquid Water Enhancer. It was a new item and the only one the store had was the Berry Pomegranate Variety. Well, I must say, it enhanced San Diego tap water and gave it a very mild pleasant taste. This time, when I went back, the store had two kinds and I opted to try the Strawberry Watermelon flavor. Maybe I like it a little better. There are a lot of other flavors available online, I should add.<br /><br />This stuff seems to work best when the water is cold and first enhanced by ice. So, I was thinking that I might us it in restaurants. You can always ask for water with your meal and the water always comes with ice and is free. Typically, I ask for water because I don't particularly like most soft drinks and I don't like drinking too many of them. So I just ask for water and then add a little squeeze or the water enhancer to give the water a very slight, almost imperceptible, freshening zest. Well, let's see. There are 24 squirts in one of these little plastic thingies, and I save about $1.50 every time I ask for water, so they pay for themselves in almost instantly. Okay, so I'm a cheapskate and I enjoy it. Plus, and most importantly, I prefer the enhanced water taste over almost any soft drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: Like many people, I'm off sugar to try to lose weight but aspartame triggers headaches, and I can't stand the taste of plain water so I'm looking for something no-cal to make drinking water tolerable. Mio offers me several choices.<br /><br />This product works fine. (BTW, I have no doubt that the low-star reviews are legit too; people perceive sweetness and flavor differently. I'm just grateful that I taste sucralose as sweet and don't get the aftertaste some people do.) The flavor is clearly artificial but pleasant. Like other Mio flavors, being able to add as much or as little as suits you is a huge advantage. I tend to like a pretty strong flavor. I keep several flavors around to enjoy whatever I feel like on a given day.

With them I can down a glass pretty quickly, whereas I can only take in a smaller amount of plain water at a time. Strawberry Watermelon is my favorite, although Berry Pomegranate is very good too. I love ordering them from Amazon because there's always one or more on hand when I need it and it's easy to see when it's time to order more. Because the containers are opaque, it's easy to run out if you buy them one at a time from a grocery, and not all stores carry them.

review/text: After finding out that I cannot have many of the powder drink mixes because some have caffeine in them I discovered MIO.  It is extremely convenient and easy to take with you on the go. Best of all, it is delicious!<br />Yes it does have propylene glycol in it, and one reviewer compares it to anti-freeze used in automobiles.  Non-food grade propylene glycol is what is used in car anti-freeze to protect the environment and animals. I think she may have been thinking of ethylene glycol, which has killed many dogs.  Food grade propylene glycol however is not what you put in your car.  Food grade propylene glycol is found in everything from some skin creams to pet foods and is used as preservative as well as preventing solutions from freezing.  The amount used in MIO is not considered harmful to humans unless you decide to consume a gallon at one sitting.  I've found that just a small squirt is more then sufficient.

review/summary: Great idea. Great Taste. Great Value.
review/text: The gist of MiO is that it's a concentrated syrup you add to water to give it flavor. It's zero calories (with no aspertine) and zero carbs so what you get for that extra flavor is essentially the same things you get from water. That also means MiO contains no nutrients or vitamins either. So don't expect it to replace your sports drink if that's what you are looking for. Another thing to note is MiO is almost made entirely of artificial ingredients, so don't consider this drink some all natural alternative like some other flavored water out there. What you do get is a way to enjoy a no calorie drink that ends up costing a lot less than the standard alternatives to sodas.<br /><br />The Strawberry Watermelon flavr is so far my favorite. It's just enough sweet from the strawberry while giving that refreshing feeling from the watermelon all at the same time. Even a tiny bit of this with just a tiny, tiny hint of flavor in my water makes it better.<br /><br />One of the selling points of MiO is you get to choose how concentrated you want your drink to be. Just one quick squirt can give you a glass loaded to the gills with flavor. As other reviewers have said it doesn't take long to figure out how much you need for your own tastes. Me? I like my drinks a bit light. Before I started using MiO I was getting 32 oz. bottles of G2 because it was a low calorie alternative to the regular Gatorade with a lighter flavor. It was also a pretty good deal at an average price of $.99 per bottle. So far my litle MiO bottle blows that away when it comes to value. Two to three good squirts will fill up a 32 oz. bottle, and so far I have been able to fill that bottle six to seven times easy (likely more as I stopped counting after that). In comparing price with the Gatorade poduct I'm definitely saving money. If you are into those 20 oz. bottles of Sobe or Vitamin Water (sold around here at a dollar a bottle on average) then you are definitely getting a good deal.<br /><br />MiO is a great way to enjoy your water without adding calories to your intake. It's also a better deal in the long run with you being able to save up to 50% or more in costs. Not to mention this flavor is a nice and refreshing way to enjoy your water.

review/summary: My name is Jeff and I am a MiO Addict!!!!
review/text: People always look at me weird when I say I DONT like the taste of water.  Unless I am working out or doing some physical task, it is NOT a good flavor for me, and when I just try to sit down and drink it, I HATE IT!!  This caused me to drink a LOT of gatorade, sodas, juices, and other calorie filled drinks.  And considering I could go through as many as 12 cans of soda a day, I KNEW this was a problem.<br /><br />I tried crystal light, fruit2O, propel, and a BUNCH of other products that are supposed to make water taste better, and they ALL disappointed me, and I was right back to where I started.<br /><br />I saw a commercial and thought I would give it a shot.  Started with fruit punch and was BLOWN AWAY!!!  So I went and tried all of the other flavors, and EACH has been good.  I am not a tea drinker, so sweet tea and peach tea do not appeal to me.  But Orange Tangerine, Mango Peach, Berry Pomegranate, Strawberry Watermelon, and even the energy flavors Black Cherry and Green Thunder all have me drinking water by the gallon!!!!<br /><br />I only have ONE problem.  I brought 8 of them to work (I work on offshore drilling rigs).  I decided to let my coworkers try them, and NOW I have them addicted too!!  In 7 days, all 8 are now empty, and we are all DYING for some more!!!<br /><br />I definitely suggest trying this product!  You can use a little, a lot, or just add until you find the taste you like.  I really think you will NOT be disappointed!!!

review/summary: So good!
review/text: Don't buy this from Amazon, it's WAY expensive! Get it $3 per bottle at your grocery store--any more than that and it's a rip off.<br /><br />However, this is delicious. I've been looking a long time for cheap water flavoring packs, and this is exactly what I've wanted.<br /><br />It also helps me that it comes in a liquid because I enjoy light flavors in my water, and it's a pain to keep half-used flavor powder packets around. And what a mess if you bump it! But this let's me choose how much I want and safely store the rest.

review/text: I have grown to hate soda because it's awful for you and it tastes dreadful after you have avoided it for a while. I have been on a water only regimen for a 2 year period to lose weight but every now and again something fruity is in order. This stuff is great whether you want a small hint or a blast of strawberry. Put some in Pellegrino and it's almost like strawberry soda only better for you. I have it stockpiled at home and at work because it's really tasty and you never know when they are going to discontinue something.  It's my new favorite thing to have around!

review/text: I really like Mio. I can add just a little to my water and make a great drink. I don't like super sugary drinks that are the norm in the US, and Mio has no sugar. So this fits perfectly with my lifestyle. And, it's much cheaper than buying pre-made drinks like Sobe.<br /><br />This is a great product which I hope stays around for many years. I hope they come out with some new flavors, like Cherry, my favorite flavor.

review/summary: Amazing...  but...
review/text: So, I just tried one of these out.  It's not overly sweet (depending on how much you add to the water, of course), but it doesn't have that grainy overly sugary taste or the "splenda" fake sugar taste some drink mixes have out there.  It's very easy to squirt just a little bit of the mixture into water and try out different amounts.  Squirt, shake the bottle, sip.  Repeat if wanted.<br /><br />The only problem that I really have is the price.  I'm looking at the price tag for just the Strawberry Watermelon as 23.50 for a 4-pack.  This may not be what it costs on average in a grocery store, but I currently do not have any grocery store available to me at the moment (deployed).  That's almost 6 dollars for a single bottle.  Now...  It may be *worth* that much, but I'm not necessarily going to pay that much for it.  Maybe if a bottle this size was 1.50-2.50 I might be considerably more inclined to buy these commonly.<br /><br />All in all, I think they're fantastic.  Tastes good.  Very compact and pocket size bottle for what it provides.  Feels sturdy so this could be a potential plus if you engage in semi-rigorous activity (i.e. biking, running, etc) and it's healthy (at least, as far as I can tell from first glance).<br /><br />5-Stars, minus one only because of the price tag being substantially out of the range I would be comfortable with spending on a product like this.

review/summary: Superior Zero Calorie Sweeteners
review/text: Mio's are great for adding true flavor to bottled water or just water in a glass.  What I like most about them is the flavor.  I've bought other zero calorie mixers before but they all had that synthetic taste, you can tell they are zero calorie/zero sugar.  I don't get that with these.  They are very handy too, you can take them with you along trips, in a back pack, camping etc and they do not leak.  I leave one by my sink downstairs to flavor the water directly from the tap and I've taken some on long trips.  It's a great way to save money and get yourself to drink more water.<br /><br />Some useful hints:<br />-Squeeze the drops into a glass first, then add water.  The flavor disperses a lot better that way.  If you go<br /> opposite you'll need to use a spoon to stir it.<br />-For water bottles that are filed to the top you should drip a few sips to make room for the added drops and<br /> room for the water to be shaken in the bottle.<br />-The prices here seem to vary alot, ever between flavors.  I got a four pack here of Strawberry Watermelon for<br /> 12.38, with super saving shipping, but I haven't seen a deal that good since.  At most grocery stores they are<br /> $3.99 each, at Walmart $3.49

review/summary: Great taste - difficult to measure
review/text: Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( � teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your � teaspoon squeeze (or carry a � teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others. For my hiking and other more solitary uses, I'll go with the longer shelf life of individual serving powdered mixes for variety.

review/text: We came across these at our local grocery store. We grabbed a bottle of the fruit punch and tried it and before long we have tried every flavor! Mango Peach is my favorite flavor out of all of them, but each one is exceptionally good!<br /><br />I only got to try this one once, because my daughter somehow managed to fine the bottle and used it to paint the kitchen with. This DOES stain counters and floors, so keep out of the reach of little kids. In case of a spill, use a Mr Clean Magic Eraser. That saved my kitchen.

review/summary: My Fav Flav for sure! Perfect for College dorms to
review/text: I sent this to my sister at college, one last so long that I figured she could give some away to her friends.  Perfect because she doesn't have a kitchen or anything so she can turn her water into something sweet with flavor fast and easy.  This is my favorite flavor and hers out of the ones we've tried so far, but they are all good.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I do detect a hint of fake sweetener which I hate, but I guess that's how it goes.<br /><br />It does last FOREVER, so if you want to try several flavors might be better to go to Target and get one of each.

review/summary: Don't let it get on your skin
review/text: I tried it for the first time today, the fruit punch flavor. When I opened the container and turned it over, nothing came out. So I gave it a squeeze and a small stream came flying out, landing on the counter top and splashing onto my hand.  The counter top is not porous, so I was able to clean that up easily enough.<br /><br />But the MIO that got onto my skin created such a stain that it would not come off my skin with normal soap. Even the 'orange' soap that normally gets grease and dirt off my hands did nothing. Finally I used the Simple Green all purpose cleaner on my hand and after much rubbing it finally came off.<br /><br />Kinda makes you wonder what stains it is making in our mouth, throat, etc.

review/summary: Great flavor + cute and practical packaging
review/text: I haven't purchased this from Amazon, but I was able to try Sempio Youndoo earlier this year, before it was available here. When I first got it, I really thought the packaging was aesthetically pleasing, and the cap/spout is well-designed (which seems like a stupid thing to note, but I have spilled more than my fair share of soy sauce from badly-designed spouts).<br /><br />I'm not much of a cook, nor do I have a distinguished palate, so this tastes to me like a more complex soy sauce, with a nuanced, savory flavor that makes dishes stand out. I originally thought "liquid seasoning" meant that it was a sauce to be generously used, but it's really concentrated so a little goes a long way. I guess it's meant to be used in place of MSG (which I've never used), but I honestly use it in place of soy sauce.<br /><br />I've recommended it to my friends and family, if they can find it. I don't cook often enough to justify buying a pack of 8 for myself, but I think it'd probably be a worthy investment to share with fellow cooks.<br /><br />As for any declared conflicts of interest: I did win this in a drawing for a sponsored event, but I certainly wasn't paid to write this review or anything.

review/summary: Beautiful First Impression
review/text: I had the opportunity to try this product through a give away contest being given on a Korean Cooking Website.<br /><br />I thought I'd provide a copy of the review I posted on the cooks site because I really loved this product and I'd love to see it become more accessible to people who enjoy it. So yes...(knudge, knudge) give it a try!<br /><br />AROMA<br />- smells similar to soy sauce, but folks don't be deceived (I'll tell you why in the next section)<br /><br />FLAVOR<br />I took a little plastic spoon and dipped it in.<br />I was really surprised. Since the scent is very similar to soy sauce I thought it would taste the same, and it does but only for a tiny moment, but then the flavor expands to reveal a very deep and wonderful flavor. The after taste is closer to shitake than soy and it really does taste beautiful. The wonderful part is that it does taste like a great replacement for MSG. The fact that it doesn't have MSG made me very happy and I feel like Sempio is setting a great example for Asain products. No MSG makes me feel prouder to use it in my kitchen<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />- Packaging is important to me. Not sure if I would always admit that but it's true. It's charming and the shape is wonderfully conducive to just grabbing a hold.<br />So there you have it my unofficial review...now I just have to decide what to make with it. I have the feeling it's going to be wonderful in JapChae, whatever I decide.<br /><br />I must of used it in everything since I'd gotten it. It's hard to find at the moment and I keep asking my korean grocery if they're planning on getting any in, so as you can probably tell I'm pretty thrilled that it's here in Amazon.

review/summary: All day flavor
review/text: I made gamja tang last night and at the end of cooking I poured a little soup in a bowl, then in the pot I added the some of the youndoo sauce. My regular bowl of soup was tasty but a little bland but the youndoo sauce was so flavorful. It wasn't just a salt-like taste (which is how I would normally season soup, or soy sauce) but it had a "all day long" cooking taste. I was quite impressed. It had enhanced the flavors that had been boiling and I didn't need any salt! I was quite impressed. Normally I have to add quite a bit of salt to soups that I don't have time to cook for a long time.<br />I am very healthy and picky about what I put in my food and I'm very please that Youndoo doesn't have MSG. I really love that it's made from vegetables and can be replaced for fish sauce/salt/soy sauce. I also noticed a little goes a long way, so that means one bottle will last me quite a bit!<br />Sempio was so generous sending two bottles to me and I am thankful! I believe this will be part of my everyday cooking. I can't wait to try this out with other recipes. Thank you Aeri and Sempio... I really enjoyed cooking with Youndoo!

If you have a recipe that calls for MSG or an MSG product use this instead.

Hershey be da----!This is the real deal; accept no substitutes. My only regret is the shipping cost from this purveyor. It's cheaper to get on a train and visit the nearest NYC Gristede's; and you get a day in Manhattan to boot! 5 stars plus for this wonderful, unbeatable product.

review/text: Fox's chocolate syrup is by far the best chocolate syrup I have ever used. I saw it in the local grocery store here in Pittsburgh, PA and tried it. After using it for about six months, the local store here stopped selling it. I briefly tried the "other brands" and there's no way I can even go back to them after using Fox's.

review/summary: Chocolate Egg Creams
review/text: As a born and raised NY'er, chocolate egg creams ( which contain neither eggs, nor actual cream) are a beverage delight. A true egg cream can onnly be made properly with U-Bet Syrup and since I am now in the Pacific NW, i can find neither egg creams, nor U-Bet (actually I have found one true NY deli that serves them), so this was a find and a treat for me. My fellow transplants from NY are delighted as well....when they drop by, I can offer them the real deal egg-cream and tell them where to find U-Bet. Thanks!

review/summary: Still the Best!
review/text: Full disclosure - I'm a New Yorker living in the south. I was raised on chocolate egg creams in the heart of Brooklyn. There was no better chocolate syrup for Chocolate malts, ice cream sundaes and egg creams. In the old soda fountains at Woolworth,s and local candy stores, U-Bet was the chocolate syrup of choice. It's still the best, and it's still in Brooklyn.

review/summary: Really good chocolate flavor
review/text: I ordered this syrup to try an egg cream. Excellent! Then I tried it to make plain chocolate milk. Also excellent! Since I live in northern Minnesota, and hot chocolate can be a year round drink, I tried it to make hot chocolate. Superb! The next step is to try it in coffee for cafe mocha. I'm also not ashamed to admit it tastes good directly from a spoon.

review/summary: Nothng But The Best!!!
review/text: I was born in Brooklyn and directly across the street from our apartment was a candy store with fountain.  My dad would always take in for a chocolate egg cream.  We moved to MA and unfortunately Fox's wasn't available.  My mom tried to make it with other syrups but the taste wasn't the same.  I now live in PA and had my friend bring me a bottle from NJ on her last visit.  Pure Heaven!  I thought I was a little girl again!  She now brings me a couple of bottles each time she comes to PA.  You don't know what you're missing until you use U-Bet chocolate for an New York Egg Cream!!!!!

review/text: I heard of Fox's chocolate syrup in a discussion about the best chocolate syrup.  I was on a cruise and our dining companions were discussing the merits of various chocolate syrups when one of them remarked about Fox's.<br />I told them I was partial to Bosco, the one I grew up with, but couldn't find where we live. She offered to send me a jar of Fox's when we returned to our respective homes.  She sent it, I loved it and so when the jar ran out, I ordered more.  Thank you!

review/summary: Fox's U-Bet is the BEST
review/text: You can believe what everyone here is saying....for an Egg Cream, Fox's U-Bet is the BEST.  I have never been to New York - but - there is a soda fountain located at the Beach Club Hotel in Disney World which I have visited "many" times and on their menu they have the "Original New York Egg Cream" and the taste cannot be duplicated with any syrup other than Fox's U-Bet.  You can make a good egg cream with just about any chocolate syrup, but if you want it to taste like the ones you get at a soda fountain "this" is the syrup you need.  And it's sooooo easy to make.  I've been trying for years to make an egg cream at home that tastes like the ones I get at Disney World and I am finally able to do it.  There's just something about this syrup - the taste is unique - and it can't be beat.  You won't be sorry if you order it because it's good just to put on top of ice cream too!

review/summary: The Original "egg cream" must have
review/text: This is 'the one.' Being a born and bred Brooklyn girl, still living in NY, and having attended the 1964 world's fair where this supposedly originated, I am all over this.  I remember going to the local 'soda fountain' as a young girl sitting at the counter and ordering egg creams with friends. I didn't realize then it was a "New York thing."  It's even waistline friendly to make; 1/4" of choc. in a glass, then add 3/4" of whole milk above that, then add up to a cup of seltzer. Mix vigorously to froth and drink. You can kick this up a notch by making what my dad always called a "black and white" ice cream soda.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to your chocolate egg cream...although that will add a few more calories!  This is sold in some but not all grocery stores at under $2.50; so if you can't find it, you can buy it here--albeit at a bit more cost.

review/summary: The best tuna that I have ever had
review/text: I wanted a really good quality tuna.  I tried the raincoast tuna and was<br />well pleased.  I make it into a tuna salad with one can tuna, celery seed,<br />black pepper,mayo and tobasco sauce and keep in the fridge at all times.<br />It makes a real good snack on crackers and sometimes I just have it with a meal.  This is an easy way for me to eat the omega rich cold water fish<br />and this tuna is far better than anything that I can buy in the local grocery stores.  The tuna meat is in large chucks.  I live in south Georgia and the only other time I had really good canned tuna was when<br />we visited family in Oregon.  I recommend this product.<br />Anne from Georgia

review/summary: Great Canned Tuna
review/text: This is the best commercial canned tuna I have ever gotten. They have canned it correctly and haven't cooked out all the nutrients, flavor, or natural coloring of the fish. They put in a chunk of fish, seal it up and cook the can, and the result is great fish. In my opinion it is worth the extra money over other mainstream brands on flavor alone, if you use it though, use it in something that will accent the flavor of this tuna rather than cover it up like tuna fish sandwiches do.

review/text: This albacore is just the best! It's moist and rich in natural juices, ....good enough to eat right out of the can with a squeeze of lemon and a little pepper.<br />But it sure makes a killer tuna salad sandwich, as well......because it's so moist it takes only a little mayo to bind it with the usual suspects for tuna salad. Makes a wonderful Salade Nicoise, as well, but you'll never miss the olive oil from the traditional oil packed tuna. This is really great.

review/text: The best honey ever!!!  I have hated honey all my life...used to gag on it as a child when my mother would try to give it to me for a cough or sore throat.  This stuff is different, totally.  First of all it is not a syrup.  It is a creamy pale yellowish mass of ecstasy....finely crystalized goop almost custardlike that I have found myself eating spoonful by spoonful right out of the jar.  It is that good.  And it is the purest of the pure and most nutritious.  So it pleases the senses as well as the mind.  Delicious stuff.  Try it.  Buy it before all the bees die due to Monsanto's Genetically Modified crops which are killing them off world wide.  Hurry buy cases of it.  You won't regret it.  Can even be used on wounds.<br /><br />I have some that I let sit in a storage bin where it got too hot and must have cooked it.  It is now melted and darker and somewhat separated between a lite syrup and crispy crystals.  It is still the best though with a little more of that traditional honey flavor.  I use a teaspoon of it in my hot oatmeal.  Ummm yum. A little goes a long way.

review/summary: All my cats love this!
review/text: I am so happy to have found a quality cat food without grains or potatoes, both of which can cause inflammatory conditions and other problems for kitties.  The use of some starch (tapioca) is necessary to make the kibble, but this is the best formulation I've found of all the brands and flavors I have researched.  I've heard that sweet potatoes can cause or exacerbate urinary and kidney stones, even though they are not actual nightshades, like potatoes, which can lead to numerous other illnesses, such as arthritis (See the excellent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/097977280X">Nightshade Free Pain Free</a> by Michael Fowler for amazing info on nightshades for people and pets - it helped me and my family enormously!).<br />So, finally a cat food which is acceptable and yummy!  All my cats love this food, and that is a rare thing around here.  They tend to have very particular and individual tastes, and rarely do they all agree on any one food.  This is the exception.  They love it!  And to note, they were not as fond of the Instinct chicken formula without the 'raw boost'; one liked, but the others were not so interested.<br />For my smallest kitty, the raw freeze-dried pieces in this are a little too big, so I just crush them between my fingers and she eats them right up.  They also seem healthy and their coats look nice after a couple of bags of this food.

If I had known that you import your juice concentrates, I'd have purchased another brand of juice. Perhaps you could update your product description to more accurately convey to the consumer just what it is you are trying to sell. I will be calling Amazon to try and return this juice and hope that I'm not stuck with this stuff because I'm certainly not going to give it to my kids. I'll stick with Knudesen's juice.

review/summary: Used to be our favorite
review/text: We have been customers of the reduced fat version of this product for 7 years.  Our son is now 8 and a very picky eater (which is why he was drinking this product in the first place).  He is also on the thin side, so he was getting about 800 calories a day from the milk, which he really needs.  But the formulation has changed from a reduced fat (2%) to a low fat (1%) version.  The taste is noticeable and he will no longer drink it.  It seems ironic that a company who sells whole milk, half and half and heavy whipping cream would eliminate a 2% milk product.  I applaud them for coming out with a lower fat, lower sugar variety- but they could give their (very) loyal customers the option of buying the original version.  I have contacted Horizon and suggested they still provide the 2% product, but they said they "were not taking suggestions at this time".  Nice, eh?

review/summary: Used to love these little boxes....
review/text: I buy these religiously for my kids lunches...until today.  From now on I will not buy these ever again.  For a quick dinner tonight I put in a pizza and pull out 2 milk boxes for my boys.  My youngest takes a sip and shakes his head dramatically.  I don't think too much of it (he just turned 2 yesterday), then 10 minutes later he takes another sip with the same reaction.  I take a sip out of curiosity and race to the sink to spit out the sludge/liquid rancid milk before I vomit.  Now I'm anxiously waiting to see if he gets sick.  I used to work in quality control and I now have no faith in Horizon's quality assurance/control practices.  Never will I buy this again!

review/summary: A 2-year-old's dream
review/text: This is almost one of the only ways I can get my daughter to drink milk. They sell it at Starbucks (much cheaper to buy it on Amazon!), so my caffeine addiction has put her into a lot of contact with this product. I recommend it for anyone trying to get their kids to meet the three daily dairy standards; because it's portable, it's easy to slip into the daily routine. Get a different straw, however, because the ones on the boxes are not very good.

review/summary: This price is a rip off!
review/text: My daughter drinks 2-3 of these each day.  I was buying this from Amazon prime until they racheted up the price.  I used to pay $14 which was competitive with Costco.  Now- it's just a COMPLETE RIP OFF!! I will buy it anywhere but Amazon now.  Unreal that they are now charging $6 more for the same milk!! Go elsewhere- even Whole Foods has it cheaper!

review/summary: Like the old formula better
review/text: My kids have been drinking this milk for years. My older son is essentially a vegetarian, and we have relied on this milk for a big percentage of his daily protein and calcium. He is also a very picky eater, so he noticed immediately the change to low-fat. I know, it has less sugar, but that's a deal-breaker for him. We're willing to let him have that extra sugar, if that's the price we have to pay for him to get his protein. Needless to say, we will be looking for a different brand.<br />BTW, I know I'm not alone. I started buying this milk on Amazon because it would sell out at all the stores in the city I live. Now there's a glut of the new low-fat milk at all the stores.

review/summary: my son LOVES this stuff
review/text: An absolute favorite in my house. My son would drink ten of these a day if we let him! He even prefers them to the chocolate variety, to which my daughter is partial. This price on Amazon is crazy. I got a pack of these this morning for $13 at my local Acme!

review/summary: Horizon is not considered organic
review/text: There is a national boycott of Horizon products as they are not organic.  This company was sold to a large conglomerate a few years ago.  Horizon is practicing "Greenwashing" - where a company claims to be sustainable, green, and organic but really is not.  Many Co-ops and local health food stores are boycotting Horizon products, including PCC Co-op in Seattle (largest co-op in the country)<br /><br />Please do some research before paying organic prices to a bogus company.

review/summary: Amazon canceled Subscribe and Save
review/text: Amazon abruptly canceled my subscription.  I used to received two packages a month and the price steadily raised about %40.  It's not too bad since my son now drinks regular milk with Quik chocolate or strawberry.  I save some money as well so it's worked out for the better.

review/summary: Very Short Expiration Date!  NO RETURNS!
review/text: Use caution when ordering more than one case at a time (unless you have an army of kids).  The expiration dates may be very short.  I ordered 5 cases on September 27, 2011.  The expiration dates on all cases were November 19, 2011.  Since it's a food product, Amazon does not allow returns.

review/text: We used to think this was a healthy product until we noticed the sugar content. This is almost liquid ice cream... If you want to avoid the extra added sugar buy only the PLAIN milk boxes

review/summary: The package redesign is terrible
review/text: They recently redesigned the packaging for these; instead of a foil tab that you pull up or punch through, you have a foil-covered hole just barely big enough for the straw.  Want to pour it into another container, such as a glass or a sippy?  Find yourself a pair of scissors.  Your child pushes the expandable straw in?  Find those scissors.  It's a horrible design, and when I pointed this out to them I was brushed off with "our testing showed this was better."  I'm wondering if anybody who works there is a parent of a little kid.<br /><br />The milk itself is good, but this packaging just makes it a royal pain.

review/text: Sometimes it's hard to get my little guy to drink milk so we would give him this as a treat once in a while. I've been buying this milk for a while with the subscribe and save option but really it doesn't seem like a good enough deal.

review/summary: can of coke
review/text: these milks have nearly as much sugar per ounce (and in volume) as a can of regular coke.  each small drink has just under 75% the sugar of one larger 12 ounce soda. this is not a good 'snack' or even a replacement for milk.<br /><br />these items while they are labeled as organic and as milk, are basically melted ice cream.

review/summary: Good as long as it's "good"
review/text: My daughter loves to get these at Starbucks whenever we go to get me an overpriced coffee.  I feel good about giving them to her because it's Organic, however, there have been more that a few times that she has gotten a rancid one that had not even yet past the expiration date!  I know these don't have to be refrigerated... but maybe they should be?  Anyway, these are great, but give em a sniff test before handing them over to your child.
