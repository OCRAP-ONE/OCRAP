review/summary: More beans than I know what to do with.
review/text: I bought this on impulse, the moment I came across it on Amazon-- I had been shopping for Jelly Bellies after not being satisfied with the pricing of bulk beans from brick and mortar/warehouse stores. 10 pounds of beans for $65?  One click and several months later and here I am.  I've had these for months and I've hardly put a dent into them.  I've had to resort to finding creative things to do with them-- like putting handfuls into individual baggies and hiding them throughout the house so I can have "surprise jelly beans" when I'm not expecting it.<br /><br />The only reason I knocked off a star in this review is because these beans literally come in just a cardboard box.  No plastic bag holding the beans, just a bunch of beans sitting in and against cardboard.  There were some small exposed seams and I did have some concern if the beans could be exposed to creepy crawlies. A one cent bag to protect the beans while they are in the box would be appreciated.

review/summary: Delicious Pork rinds - great flavors!
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised that these puff up nicely and evenly.  The bags are resealable pouches so you can make a small handful or up to 8 cups (the entire pouch).  Pour as much as you want onto a plate and mircowave, it is pretty easy to see & determine when they are fully puffed and ready to serve.  They are made with natural ingredients (and gluten-free).<br /><br />I wish they sold a smaller variety pack, or just single packs.  If you really like one flavor, or you only want to spend a little money to try these, you are still stuck buying the 6 pack.  At first glance the 6 pack is more expensive than Lawry's, but these actually contain more rinds and more will actually puff for you to eat.<br /><br />Compared to the best-selling Lawry's Microwave Pork Rinds, these have better flavor, more variety of flavors, puff up better, and taste better.  Lawry's are individually sealed bags, like microwave popcorn.  Sometimes I do not want an entire bag just for me, and if I am sharing then I have to make multiple bags (one at a time).  There are always a small pile of uncooked/un-puffed rinds at the bottom of the bag.  Lawry's over-seasons with crap, and contain MSG.  After trying Chef Piggy Tail, I will not buy Lawry's again.<br /><br />Overall, Chef Piggy Pork Rinds are a good value for the money.  I will buy these again.

review/summary: Great product, watch out for expiration date
review/text: Let me start by saying how much i love chimes and their adorable little tin packaging. I ordered these last Christmas to include in little gift packages... Ive ordered them before from amazon and had no problem, though this time they came in an opened box and with the expiration code on the bottom of the tin rubbed/blotted out. On some of the packages I could still faintly make out a date from early 2010 though. By no means did I want to give as gifts expired candy, let alone boxes that had been tampered with. I called amazon and they promptly replaced the case, though unfortunately the new case was expired as well(despite me asking for them to check), though the dates had not been rubbed out. At this point, I knew that the entire batch was just probably old and took my chances and asked them to replace with a different flavor(as I knew they would not check), hoping the new flavor was from a different shipment. Luckily, the mango ones I ordered were fine and did not expire until 2012. It was just terribly unfortunate that such a great item had no checks or balances before they left the amazon warehouse- ultimately amazon replaced both boxes, but it was a hassle and disappointment to keep getting old merchandise.

review/summary: An alternative flavor for green tea lovers
review/text: I have heard this described as a "starter" green tea. One of its general selling points is that it has a sweet, floral flavor that sits on top of and "does away with" some of the things about green tea that drive some first time users away: the grassy flavor and bitter aftertaste. I like it, but I am not really crazy about it.<br /><br />To me, this is a tea to have in moderate amounts. Though it makes a nice alternative to try some new flavor, it is not actually a blend I favor keeping too much around (the pound or so you get in the "Amazon six-pack" will probably last me for a couple of years and I drink 8-12 cups of tea a day if not more). I would recommend making it sort of weak because if you approach any real level of tea strength the jasmine flavor will become the opposite of its intention: cloying and bitter. It mixes well with Twining's Gunpowder Green (half and half, some allowances for the differences in textures) if you are interested in a slightly more appropriate "starter" blend that allows the natural taste of green to shine but still clips off the more leafy flavor on the back of the tongue.<br /><br />The best time to drink this, it seems to me, is a relaxed moderate day where you can get something of a natural breeze to go with the absolute best bit of this blend: its aroma.

review/summary: A Rich Flower Garden in Bloom.
review/text: A Ming Dynasty (AD 1368 - 1644) creation believed to lower cholesterol and promote longevity, jasmine tea consists of Chinese green tea leaves - usually green teas from Fujian province, which is also home to the semi-fermented Oolong and smoky Lapsang Souchong - scented with jasmine flowers. Traditionally, the flowers are harvested during the day and stored in a cool place until nightfall, when they develop their full fragrance. They are then layered over the tea leaves, which have previously been steamed or heated to prevent their oxidation. The tea's quality is determined both by the quality of the green tea used as its base and by the effectiveness of the scenting process. Brewed, it has a delicate, silvery color and a rich fragrance reminiscent of a flower garden in bloom.

review/summary: delicious and aromatic
review/text: Loose leaf tea is nearly always better than the smaller grained tea bag sort, and Twinings Jasmine loose tea is no exception. Sometimes Jasmine tea can taste a little bitter, though, so be sure the water is hot, but not too hot (i.e. not  quite boiling--give it a little time to cool before adding to leaves).  It may take the slightest bit more of work, but gaining the full flavor and aroma of the larger leaves is well worth the effort. If you like the flavor and/or benefits of green tea, this will be a nice addition to the collection.

To make matters worse, when I finally located their hard-to-find contact info. and told them, they simply apologized. No offers for reimbursement, return, or anything. Then when I made clear that I wanted to return it, they told me how, but I had to pay for shipping, which was expensive (of course I was only able to return the unopened tins). Never buying from Twinings again; even the bagged stuff I get from my local Trader Joe's is way better and I'm used to the loose-leaf stuff.

review/summary: Not enough jasmine aroma
review/text: I love Jasmine Green tea, hence I wanted to give this Twinings Jasmine Green Tea a try. I am disappointed. Yes, there are some jasmine petals and there is a weak jasmine smell when you open the tin, but the jasmine aroma is very very weak in the resulting brewed tea. Yes, one can use more tea than the usual amount trying to get some jasmine flavour, but this time the resulting tea ends up very bitter. I have had far more flavorful jasmine green teas from tea stores, or even the jasmine green tea I recently got at a Peet's Coffee & Tea store was far more aromatic.<br /><br />If you like your jasmine green tea with 'jasmine' flavour (like me), I would not recommend you buying this tea. On the other hand, if you are looking for a jasmine green tea with very very weak jasmine flavour, then this tea might be a good choice for you.

This tea is not a bunch of ground up leaves that are like dust- you get nice tea leaves and flowers. One word of warning- steeping the tea too long will result in a less jasmine taste as it will start to get bitter. This tea is so good and doesn't need any added milk or sweetener. I love it so much that I use it every day and have signed up for the subscribe and save program so I will always have it. Plus, it is less expensive than at the grocery store and saves me gas money and I don't run out.

review/text: This was the first coffee I sampled from my Keurig coffee maker.  The flavor is nutty and mild without the acidity of many drip coffees.  I am not a fan of the bold, strong coffees and prefer the milder blends.  This is a great early morning coffee to enjoy with your breakfast.  While you can order it on Amazon, I've found it for a better price on another website provided I buy 4 boxes of 25 K cups at a time.  However, I can mix and match other flavors and brands to get the 4 boxes.<br /><br />I like flavored coffee as well so in addition to the Nantucket, I also recommend the Southern Pecan and Wild Blueberry.  I like to brew a cup of the blueberry just to make the room smell like blueberry cobbler. Also check out Gloria Jeans K-Cups, French Vanilla, 25-Count Box (Pack of 2) if you like flavored coffee.

review/text: It's interesting how different people perceive coffee.  Some here thought it was watery and tasteless, while others love it.  As for me, it has a nice taste, somewhat mild, and not bitter at all.  It diesn't leave an aftertaste as some do and isn't over-powering.  This is my choice to drink alone without any food.  I think cookies or biscuits or whatever would over power it.  When I have my coffe with food I choose a stronger roast.  So for a late morning or mid afternoon cup, or a cup at my desk, this is just right.  For breakfast something stronger would be better.<br />All that said, I can almost always find these K cups much cheaper at my local stores than at Amazon.

review/text: I have a B60 and only brew the small cup size, because the large size makes the coffee seem watered down. This is problem with all the KCUPS I've tried. I did purchase a large selection of the Green Mountain coffee and I really like Lake and Lodge and Dark Magic. I prefer the stronger blends over the milder flavored choices.

review/summary: Warm Brown Water
review/text: That's what my mother said, and she doesn't even like strong coffee! We got her a Keurig machine for Christmas, and so far have had fun trying the various K-Cups. Mom is leaning towards Wake-Up Call as an everyday coffee, and my wife and I (who drink Jeremiah's Pick Fogbuster or Longbottom Black Gold as our morning cup) think that's good, too. So, to keep this short, Nantucket Blend doesn't taste bad, it just doesn't have much flavor. If you like your coffee very mild/weak, you might love it. If you like stronger, bolder, darker blends, forget about it.

review/summary: It's so good, I don't even want to tell you because I'm afraid the price will go up (law of supply and demand)
review/text: I'm making myself tell what I would prefer to keep secret:  Truly this is the best-quality,genuine article,cold-pressed (in small quantities)olive oil, made right here in the U.S.A. (California).  People (including, in the past, myself)don't actually understand that even the olive oils imported from Italy now are sub-standard.  Bariani, by contrast, is the nearest to what was consumed by the Greeks and Romans of long ago:  simply cold-pressed in small batches, no heat is used, no other oils are used, no other additives are used.<br /><br />I'm not a gourmet, instead I am a fat 51-year-old that tends to veer towards the boxed hamburger meals when desperate!  This is not "snooty gourmets" liking their incidental odd-tasting items, Bariani Olive Oil is truly and simply a great product and I agree with all the other reviewers: EXCELLENT.<br /><br />By the way, I do know the first clue that you are not buying a true olive oil is when the container is clear:  true olive oil cannot be exposed to direct sunlight. Bariani uses a proper, imported, dark-green bottle for their very special product.<br /><br />Even Olive Oil can get complicated:  the majority of olive oils, imported and domestic, are heated, not 100% olive oil and taste terrible after tasting Bariani.<br /><br />I also buy through the company website and by phone and these people are so kind and upstanding -- it's family owned and they intend to keep it that way.<br /><br />The only concern I have is the day will come when Bariani may have to increase their prices due to the law of supply and demand...and I would still buy it!<br /><br />YES IT IS AS GOOD AS EVERYONE IS SAYING IN THEIR REVIEWS.

review/summary: The Great Olive Oil Scandal and why you should use Bariani
review/text: The problem with most of today's olive oil is that it is rarely produced in the old way, which is more time consuming and expensive. Due to the increasing demand for olive oil, the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations. These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply, but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil.<br /><br />To reduce costs, olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs. Olives that have dropped on the ground, which can be said to contain bad oil, are often mixed with the good ones. They are shipped in all kinds of containers, many of which are poorly ventilated, and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy. The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil.<br /><br />Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process, thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil. Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process. Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away, factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months, whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years.<br /><br />Most people think that by purchasing "extra virgin" olive oil they are getting a high quality oil.  Unfortunately, in most cases, this is not true. It's more complex than that. A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality. For one thing, nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100% from olives.<br /><br />Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin. But now the oil has been refined, and that's not what you want. That's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil, which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value. To complicate matters even more, the term "extra virgin" has no official meaning in the United States. The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council. So, olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards.<br /><br />Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year, and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century. Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum, a Swiss-German magazine, and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade, and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful. Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap, highly-refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey. International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved. As much as 20% hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer. In fact olive oil labeled "Italian" often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece. Considering what has happened in Europe, where there are strict regulations, imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations. Apparently, more oil is "produced" in California than there are olives available. The truth is, most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil.<br /><br />The bottom line is that modem, factory-produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients, and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult.<br /><br />Bariani olive oil is produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California. Their olives are grown without pesticides.  They are hand picked from the trees, carefully washed and dried, and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting. It is pressed in a hydraulic press, collected in stainless steel vats, decanted, and bottled.  This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness.

review/summary: The Best
review/text: When I learned about "good fats vs bad fats" I went on a quest to find the best olive oil.  I wanted one that would be both good for cooking and taste great on it's own.  After much research (and buying in local supermarkets) I came upon Bariani's web site.  I have been ordering this olive oil now for four years and it is a staple in my home.  I couldn't imagine cooking without it.

review/summary: A remakably mixed review
review/text: This olive oil adds a freshness to every dish that you're bound to notice.  It's true what the others are saying, this oil is different than most others.  When I first got tasted it strait, was shocked at the resemblence to wheat grass juice and the bitterness that lingers in the back of your throat.  Compared to my regular store bought EVOO's heaviness and richness, this one is clean and bright.  But my first reaction was to write the seller and find out if my bottle tasted as it should or if I'd gotten a bad bottle.  They wrote back saying that the grassy flavor and "peppery notes" (bitterness, in my book) comes from the relatively young olives.  I was also impressed by the fact that I got this in Sept and it was bottled as recently as August, probably also responsible for the fresh taste.  Getting this olive oil inspired me to try some other brands and I have found a very similar taste without the bitterness in the slightly less exensive Trader Joe's Australian variety of EVOO.  Both are great when used in fresh dishes and shine best when they aren't cooked.  My biggest question is, why aren't people reviewing more EVOO products on Amazon.  The fact that this one is the only one who's following sings it's praises here should tell you that it's worth trying.

review/summary: For those concerned about bitterness...
review/text: I noticed that a number of reviewers commented on the "bitterness" of the Bariani extra virgin olive oil.  I tried out both their 2010 "early harvest" (green) olive oil and their regular fall 2010 olive oil.  I found their green olive oil to have a stronger, grassy (they mention the high chlorophyll content, which you do get!) flavor, with a distinct bitter edge and peppery finish.  This would be great for someone who gravitates toward a greener, bolder flavor and perhaps a more adventurous experience.  I found it too bitter for my pestos though it worked just fine with roasted chicken, and I think would be great for dipping bread.  Their regular extra virgin olive oil has a faint bitter, peppery finish, but overall a more neutral flavor -- good all around olive oil and a safer bet for those who are sensitive to bitter or stronger flavors.

review/summary: Might not be to your liking
review/text: After reading alot of favorable reviews here on Amazon, I decided to buy some early harvest Bariani from Fall 08.<br />Overall, I was very turned off by the taste of this olive oil.  I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch.  Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.  And it wasn't something that was subtle, I actually cringed a little bit on my first tasting.  I will look elsewhere for my next bottle of olive oil.

review/summary: Bariani Olive Oil - Is it worth it?
review/text: Generally I buy olive oil in large 2 liter containers because we use in for cooking, baking and just about anything that asks for lard or butter.  We feel using olive oil is a far healthier and tastier souce of oil to use than the latter.  However, when I started researching more and hearing stories of outdated olive oil and needing to have it in a dark container I became worried about where I get my olive Oil... Generally at Sams Club or Costco....  So I opted to spend a few extra bucks more to get it in a dark bottle and hopefully current year stock.  I purchased this lovely Bariani EVOO and it looked and smelled great, but honestly it didn't taste any different than the EVOO that I get elsewhere and the date on the bottle was confusing.... harvested in 2010 and bottled in 2011?  Since I just purchased it September 2011 I was trying to figure out why. So, I contacted the company that produces this oil hoping to get some clarification on the details (since olive oil does not improve with age) and never heard back from them.  So now I won't bother spending the extra money on that product.  I did buy their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WK3F9Q">Bariani Balsamic Vinegar 16.9 oz.</a> and that is superb, but again sine I never heard from the company, why should I buy from them again?  Disappointed!<br /><br />UPDATE----- Since the Bariani company did not respond I contacted a reputable California company "Calolea" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IUSIFO">Calolea California Mission Blend Extra Virgin Olive Oil 500 Ml</a>and they offered this informative response:<br /><br />Olives are harvested here in California between late October thru the middle of January.  It takes some time to do all of the blending and bottling so the oil doesn't usually hit the stores until after the new year.  So it is normal that oils made in 2010 come out in 2011.<br />As to what makes oils extra virgin, it is a reference to how much free fatty acid is present in the oil.  The international standard is .08% of free fatty acid.  The California standard is .05%.  Our olive oil is usually between .01 to .02% so well below the definition of extra virgin.  We accomplish this by picking and pressing within 24 hours. Olive oil does not get better with age!  You should try to get oils that are fresh and use it quickly.  Some companies come out with Olio Nuevo, new oil, during and right after harvest, this is when the oil is at its best but beware because sometimes it is very strong.

review/summary: A wonderful oil that improves with time
review/text: We only just discovered that Amazon sells this oil - we've been buying it direct from Bariani.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers: this is remarkably different from most oils on the market - my last purchase was received 14 days after initial bottling and it does indeed taste like fresh green olives: deep and with a bitter aftertaste. Bought two bottles last time to see the effect of age and were pleased to find that it matures exceptionally well - the taste becomes increasingly mellow and buttery but retains the taste of olives. Wonderful drizzled over antipasti, or simply with crusty bread (and a glass of red (hem, hem). A little bit of Italy in a bottle.<br /><br />Both bottles due to run out soon more is being ordered.<br /><br />Anyone know the case price?

review/text: I have been a Bariani's customer for couple years I think, don't even remember where I got the recommendation that it was a high quality olive oil, but I ordered directly from their website until now and have only used their olive oil ever since. I placed this order recently with amazon because it was actually cheaper than using Bariani's own website, go figure. As any extra virgin olive oil, this is not a product to use for cooking, it is very sensitive to high temps, so use it on you salad dressing, smoked salmon, to top off you pizza or anything you like. It is a very light and tasty olive oil.

review/text: I have to agree with the sizeable minority here that this olive oil is just too bitter (at least the Fall 08 bottling).  The flavor starts a bit grassy, but then a flat, mouth-puckering astringency takes over. At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same.  I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.  I have tried a variety of premium olive oils from the California, Europe, and Australia and have never experienced such an unbalanced olive oil.  Given the number of good reviews out there, I hope I just got a bad batch.

review/summary: overly bitter
review/text: Earthy? Buttery? Fruity? Peppery? Grassy?<br /><br />If you're looking for something other than bitter, you might want to keep looking. I found this olive oil to be overwhelmingly acrid and bitter: a real disappointment.<br /><br />I understand that the taste profile of good, unadulterated olive oil might include slight bitterness, but with this oil (at least the fall 2008 bottling) bitterness was the only note.

review/summary: Great product!
review/text: I am really in to locally grown but when it comes to olive oil, that is hard to do. (And who can do without olive oil?) This California oil is as close to Georgia as I have been able to get.  And the taste is amazing!  I also really like the Nourishing Traditions (cookbook- also on Amazon)idea of using unfiltered olive oil and this is it.  I have ordered it elsewhere but it was cheaper on Amazon. Very pleased and will order it again.

review/summary: Good but I prefer the Tuscan ones
review/text: I like this olive oil because it has a distinct grassy taste, but it's not as good as the best Tuscan ones like the Badia A Coltibuono ones especially the Campo Corto <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058DL846">Campo Corto 100% Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil 16.9 oz by Badia a Colitbuono</a>, or Marfuga that you can buy from Williams Sonoma.<br /><br />I enjoyed Bariani's distinctive olive taste which is superior to most good olive oils that you can get for $20 at the supermarket, so I don't think Bariani is that bad but I agree with other reviewers that its aftertaste is bitter rather than peppery. I don't mind the bitterness because I think it adds character but I also like them peppery and this one is not peppery enough.

When the oil was gone we were lost. After calling him he told me to go on line and try Amazon. This is our third time and we get the large bottle of oil and the Balsimic Viniger they make to go with it. Positively the best vinager and oil going. We will not even try another brand. I cant wait to have a salad for dinner.

review/summary: A new experience in olive oil - smooth & peppery!
review/text: First of all, this item came well packaged in eco friendly packing peanuts. Run them in a bit of water and they disintegrate into nothing! I am into trying to be 'green' so I thought that was nice. It came on the day they said it would.<br /><br />As for the olive oil, I needed a high quality oil to get the proper fats into my family. I love a good oil but I am no expert in oils. I think this one tastes smooth and peppery, not heavy. I will use this oil for dishes where I don't need it heated, and I will use my cheaper stuff on the stove.<br /><br />UPDATE Jan 17, 2012 - Good stuff, esp on a salad with a good balsamic vinegar. I would give it 5 stars if my palate were more refined and had experienced more EVOO's out there.

review/summary: Best Olive Oil I've bought!
review/text: I was listening to public radio one day awhile back ago, and the topic was on olive oil. I learned alot from this program and it really wasn't something that gave me much thought, until then. My<br /><br />"better half" never liked extra virgin olive oil because of the rancid flavor. Alas, cheap olive oil, walmart brand! Since then Iv'e tried several different brands. I love Lucini and Lucini garlic infused, which combined with a baked potato, is out of this world. The Bariani is really tasty and I've fried with it, mixed it in dips and on and on, it's the most flavorful to me.From what I gather this oil is somewhat made the old-world way, no fancy process or frills, the real stuff and it shows in it's flavor and sight. The only complaint I had with my order was when I recieved my bottle it was frozen solid and luckily the glass didn't crack. I live in WI and this was in Nov. So I faulted knowone.  Don't be afraid to try different brands and I will eventually give the Creta brand from Greece a try.Give Bariani a shot, it's that good!

review/summary: Fan for 6 years
review/text: I've been buying Bariani Olive Oil for over 6 years. At first, I couldn't find it anywhere and they didn't have the online website so I had to call Emmanuele Bariani in SF and order the product over the phone. Now I buy from their website directly. This oil is amazing. And I understand all the reviews, positive and negative. It's a matter of taste. For me, this works. It's cold pressed. It's kept in a dark bottle. I can support it through my orders and help the company grow. Overall, it makes me happy. AND I cook with it. That's right, I cook it - when I need to cook olive oil - and it tastes fantastic either way.<br /><br />Give it a shot, make your informed decision, and then move on if you don't like it. Or get addicted like I am.

So I ordered a case (6 bottles) of 33.6 oz Bariani this fall 2010 and boy, was I disappointed!!!  This oil has a BITTER finish.  Sore throat bitter! I dont remember it being like this--this bitterness is memorable!  Has the production changed?  Does the oil get damaged by heat in a warehouse situation?  First impression is pleasant but the flavor is soon replaced by an extreme bitterness.<br /><br />I'll use the Bariani for cooking and hope that Im not poisoning myself.

OK,  for me, this one is fine for sauteeing- just not the best fresh flavor for dipping or dressings.

review/text: I have done considerable reading on olive oil quality and sad to say, there is quite a bit of adulterated oil on the market. I cannot determine the true source of their oil, but each of the three bottles I purchased had a very acidic bite to it: either the oil was rancid or simply of very poor quality. Good oil will have a smooth buttery quality to it --- you can sip olive oil with the same delicateness of palate as you would wine. This oil however completely fails this test.

review/text: I've been searching for a low/no cal sweetener, and liked the what I read about erythritol as a potential option.  I specifically liked that it seemed that erythritol is metabolized in a way that helped prevent or reduce gastric issues.  Unfortunately, this was not the case for me.  I did a pretty strictly controlled introduction of iced tea sweetened with erythritol into my diet, and both times I tried it I had significant gastric issues.<br /><br />Maybe I'm overly sensitive to it, or something, but I had to move on and look for other options.  The taste was pretty good, though - not exactly like sugar, and the cooling effect is certainly noticeable, but not unpleasant.

review/text: This does taste good, has 0 calories, and isn't supposed to be toxic for dogs (I still wouldn't feed it to them, though) unlike some other sugar alcohols. It tastes like sugar and seems to behave just like sugar in terms of crystallization. I haven't tried baking with it, but it would probably work OK so long as you don't replace all the sugar. It is very expensive, though, which is why it only gets 4 stars. Pound for pound compared to other sweeteners it doesn't look too bad, until you consider the relative density. Splenda is much less dense so a pound of that probably goes 3x as far as a pound of this stuff (which is every bit as dense as sugar). That is something to consider when comparing costs. For me I will probably stick with Splenda.

I don't like Stevia, and the common ones-Aspertame and Saccharin- are just too controversial in perhaps causing health problems. I am a member of Weight Watchers, and have always used Sweet & Low in foods such as oatmeal.  Since using ZSweet, I'll never go back to S & L.  Zsweet is terribly expensive, but I believe it's worth it, since they claim to have no chemicals in it. I do recommend it, if you want your sugar substitute to taste just like sugar.

review/summary: Great sugar replacement
review/text: This product is great. I am a diabetic and finally found a natural sugar substitude which actually tastes and feels just like sugar, yes, it feels like sugar because it is granulated just like sugar and it does not have an aftertaste, I love it. We use it in everything we want to sweeten, I mean everything.

review/summary: wonderful product!!!!!!
review/text: I cannot stand artificial sweeteners.  All of them.  They leave a nasty, noticiable aftertaste that lasts some time, and my beverage consumption was pretty much limited to water and unsweetened iced tea.  I drank unsweetened coffee, but didn't enjoy it much.<br /><br />I read an artificial sweetener review in Cook's Illustrated.  They had great things to say about Zsweet in beverages...calling it "brilliant".  Sure...uhuh.... I thought.  Doubt it!  But I tried it anyway.  I was delighted to find out they were right.  In coffe, tea, and homemade lemon or limeade, sprinkled over strawberries, I can't tell the difference between sugar and Zsweet.  It really is...brilliant!<br /><br />Two things to note, because erythritol is only 70% as sweet as sugar, I use more of it than I would sugar.  But 25% more of zero calories is still zero calories!  I've tried it as a sweetener in whipped cream, and it makes the whipped cream gritty.<br /><br />It seems silly to say that a product enhanced my quality of life... but I'm enjoying two important things again (coffee and tea) that I had not in some time.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: I took my family off all white sugar and white flour about a month ago.  Over the month we have tried many different natural sugar substitutes and this one was by far the best.  No strange aftertaste and works with things that need to be cooked.  Would recommend that it be put into the food processor to ground more finely before using directly on foods such as oatmeal or sprinkled in frozen strawberries.  Just ordered my second round and very happy amazon carries this product!

review/text: This is an excellent way to sweeten whatever you need it for.  You can't tell the difference from the sugar you're so used to.  And most important, the pricing is fair.<br /><br />Lovin' it!

review/summary: Best sweetener I've found for weight management
review/text: I used Splenda for a long time to keep sugar out of my diet, but decided to try this as an experiment. I like it better. While the taste is a bit inferior, I seem to be able to use less of it, and it doesn't seem as likely to trigger cravings for more food later. Some of the more recent research says that this is the Achilles heel of sweeteners - using them may save calories immediately, but makes you want to consume more later. In my own case, ZSweet (containing erythritol) does that less than Splenda (sucralose). (Of course, everyone's metabolism is different, so your mileage may vary.)<br /><br />It's way superior to the other sugar-alcohol products. With erythritol, I've never noticed the digestive side effects that maltitol and sorbitol cause if you consume any significant amount.<br /><br />In addition to cooking, coffee, mixing in shakes, etc., I also use this when I want a bit of chocolate. Here's my trick: I get dark, dark chocolate (85-90% cocoa), which has only a very small amount of sugar - typically about 4 grams per serving. Then I put a little bit of this ZSweet powder in a saucer, and dip the chocolate in it for a dusting before taking a bite. That allows me to eat high quality chocolate, and to get some decent sweetness, without the sugar and without the side effect of sugar alcohols in most sugar-free chocolate.<br /><br />*** Update 3 June 2012 ***<br /><br />After using up my first batch, I ordered another. This one isn't the same. The product is coarser, and does not dissolve nearly as well. In cold drinks, it pools at the bottom unless I vigorously stir and shake.<br /><br />Also, one of the two packages had a defect and leaked at the bottom. I thought I was just pouring wrong until I found the leak, after sweeping up a couple of times.<br /><br />So I subtracted a star from my previous enthusiastic review. We'll see on the next batch if they fix these problems. If not, I might have to look elsewhere for erythritol.

review/summary: Excellent natural, low carb sweetener
review/text: This is the first low carb, natural sweetener I've found that isn't bitter. I've tried xylitol (digestive upsets), liquid and granulated splenda (terrible taste in chocolate, a chlorinated synthetic product), and stevia (bitter and hard to bake with). Erythritol is by far the best tasting, I think. Zsweet adds a tiny bit of splenda, which helps with the sweetening intensity.<br /><br />I buy the granulated Zsweet and then process it in my food processor before storing it. Powdered Zsweet dissolves far better in liquids and works better in the low carb protein bars that I make weekly.<br /><br />Nobody can ever seem to tell that the treats I make with Zsweet (and almond flour rather than wheat flour) aren't sweetened with sugar.

review/summary: The best no calorie sweetener hands down
review/text: I have been  following a no sugar diet for almost a year, I have tried everything from Splenda to Stevia and have not tasted anything that compares to this.<br />There is absolutely no aftertaste, it is granulated and looks like sugar . I have it in my sugar bowl and no one has ever questioned wether it was real sugar or not.<br />I wish it was more widely available in stores but with Amazon I get it within 2 days.  the only thing is, you must get the bulk bags not the packets, the packets are formulated to be<br />super sweet and they put something in it that changes the taste completely. I wish they would just take the original formula and put it in packets, even if they were a little larger<br />so it would be more portable.

review/summary: makes baking with stevia easy!
review/text: About 6 months ago my Dr ordered me to go as sugar-free as possible but no artificial sweetners. I was already familiar with stevia from drinking Zevia and Blue Sky Free sodas so I bought a stevia cookbook so I could make my own desserts. The recipes were extremely disappointing! Since stevia doesn't have the bulk of sugar you have to do all kinds of replacements and substitutions that can't compare to the "traditional" recipes. To make things as sweet as I like the amount of stevia I had to use would leave a bitter or strange aftertaste. So frustrating! Then I noticed my Zevia soda had Erythitol listed before stevia so I looked in to it and found Zsweet. It's not nearly as sweet as sugar but it has the bulk! Dream come true for me. Now I can use any recipe I want. I can make chocolate chip cookies from the recipe on the bag and just substitute Zsweet for the sugar and add stevia to make the Zsweet sweet enough. Super Easy!

review/summary: Snickerdoodles were inedible
review/text: So...given the history of this sweetener (discovered in 1848, naturally occurring, etc.) I was pretty excited to try it. I whipped out a recipe for snickerdoodles and went to work.. My first bite got a big thumbs up...then the weird "cooling" started up...like eating breath mint cookies.  My daughter called them "prank cookies."  Blegh.  Maybe I'll do some research on what can actually be made with this stuff, maybe not...it's sitting unused in my cabinet.

review/summary: So far I'm loving it!
review/text: I gained so much weight this winter and with warm weather upon me I don't have big sweatsuits to hind behind. I know sugar is one of my biggest problems but I refuse to use artificial junk, that stuff is poison. So I tried stevia and I really wanted like it but yuck. I read reveiw after reveiw and decided to try this and it's good, tastes like sugar.I don't really care that much about baking, but I have to have sugar in my coffee and tea and Zsweet tastes just as good. I just hope I don't get gastric problems, I'll take it slow like some reveiwers said. I really waht thank everyone for reveiwing products it helps so many people decide which product is best for them.

review/summary: The best ever sweetener Zsweet
review/text: This is a fantastic product. It is a versatile sweetener tastes exactly like sugar with no aftertaste. It can be used to bake as well as in drinks etc. I love it. It means I can bake for my family and enjoy it too. I am a diabetic.<br />I love it --- there is one snag  -  because I live in the UK and the product is quite new it is VERY expensive here.
