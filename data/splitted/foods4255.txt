review/summary: A really great coffee
review/text: I have tried many different coffees for the Keurig and this is my favorite, by far (Caribou blend is next on my list). To be honest, some people may find the Midnight Magic a bit bold, but it is definitely the one for me in the morning. I like to follow up with Caribou in the afternoon and then Timothy's decaf in the evenings.

Midnight Magic also works nicely when you use the 10/11oz brew size or use it twice on a B30.  Not as strong, but will not taste watered down either.

This is simply a site that allows you to sell/trade/give your unwanted coffee flavors to someone else in the group to buy or try. It's your business how it's done. You can also tell everyone your experiences with different flavors, and what to watch out for.<br /><br />This Group is the logical way for us to do this, as no one wants to get stuck with 50 cups of a flavor they totally dislike, right? It also gives you the chance to try a flavor you'd never buy from the description.<br /><br />Anyway, the group is 100% free to join and use, and I'll do my best to monitor it for spam. It's at: [...]<br /><br />Hope to see you there.  Dean

review/text: This is the second k-cup variety I've tried that turned out to be more burnt than just dark roasted.  And again, I'd like to think it's just the batch.  But I've found so many really good k-cup varieties, I'm not likely to try a second box.<br /><br />There are other ways to get a stronger flavor than to literally burn the beans.

review/summary: It's dark at midnight...
review/text: ...but it's always darkest just before the dawn. Midnight Magic lays down a thick approach: you have to brace yourself before the first sip.  It's best served black, so that the bitterness itself can wake you up.<br /><br />I found it to be an adequate substitute for Green Mountain's Dark Magic, but it was not quite it's equal in the realm of metaphysical impact.

review/summary: Decent, but overall a disappointment
review/text: For Timothy's Midnight Magic to be the highest rated K-cup on Amazon, I'm thinking 2 things could be off:<br />1) I received a "bad batch" which several reviewers are so fond of referencing.  Or<br />2) The people writing reviews have never been outside of a Starbucks and think a French Press is something you do in the gym.<br /><br />In general I have a low opinion of K-cups, and Tim's didn't do much to change that.  The roast was quite heavy and I found the flavor flat, and lacking character.  I have tried many different types, but Keurig just doesn't deliver quality results.

review/summary: unhealthy stuff!!! --MY EXPERIENCE with this stuff
review/text: Initially we were so happy to find this darkest of the dark roasts. I really enjoyed this coffee every morning for over a year.  However after extended use, I started becoming very irritable in my day, insomnia, ect. After seeing doctors for PMS and everything else, I just got on the web and searched for "caffeine sensitivity".  I learned a little something about coffee from a website,  ineedcoffee dot com.<br /><br />Dark roasts are terribly unhealthy for you! Dark Roasts break down the sugar and oils and burn the coffee bean to a crisp and you are left with ash material. Not many people can tolerate this and will experience unpleasant side effects which lead you to believe your falling apart when really it's an adversion to the dark roasted beans. It only took one cup in the morning to affect my overall health.<br /><br />So as much as I enjoy this super dark roasted coffee, I must make the switch to the light roast.  At least now, I am able to determine if it is a quality coffee bean or not because it is not charcoal.

review/summary: The BEST extra bold K-cup out there!
review/text: My wife and I love this k-cup. We've tested all the extra bold dark roasts out there. In fact, we did blind taste tests and pitted Timothy's Midnight Magic vs. Green Mountain EB Dark Magic, Gloria Jeans EB Black Gold, Van Houtte's Eclipse EB, Green Mountain EB Espresso Blend, Green Mountain EB Sumatran Reserve, Timothy's EB Parisian Nights, Coffee People EB Organic, Coffee People EB French Roast, Tully's EB French Roast and Tully's EB Italian Roast. Yes, we honestly tested them all. Many of the other contenders are fine coffees in their own right and without direct comparison to Midnight Magic, they'd be a fine k-cup. But when compared directly with Timothy's Midnight Magic, we found we chose it every time in blind taste tests. It amazed me when my wife picked it every single time.<br /><br />There is no way you'd be let down by this k-cup if you like extra bold, dark roasted coffee. It's just perfect!<br /><br />A must buy for Keurig owners!

I didn't know whether to blame it on the machine or the coffee, so I read some reviews and tried the Midnight Magic and the Rainforest Espresso.  Both both make a great cup of nice, strong, flavorful coffee that is good enough to replace my daily Starbucks run.

review/summary: Great K-Cup coffee!
review/text: This was my first coffee order for my new K-60 that came at Christmas. I read the reviews for virtually all the K-cups that Amazon offers and chose this one based on its consistently high rating. The name scared me a bit, but I had to give it a try.<br /><br />I am very happy with this choice. Midnight Magic is strong but not bitter or harsh. Its smooth and strong flavor comes through the half-and-half and Splenda that I drown all coffee in. I'm not quite the coffee-gourmet that others are so I can't say crazy junk like "hint of chocolate" or "strong notes of bark." I just know it tastes like strong, smooth, non-bitter coffee and I like it.<br /><br />Its caffeine buzz factor is about average for a cup of coffee, so don't let the name fool you into thinking you'll spend all night staring at the wall and shaking. It packs no more chemical punch than the weaker-tasting brews, and you get to enjoy the flavor and complexity much more. I currently have Midnight Magic in the rotation as my wake-up cup and it does well there.<br /><br />I will still try a few other K-cup varieties including the Coffee People selection. But I will always keep a supply of Midnight Magic on hand in the future.

review/summary: Rewarding, not challenging
review/text: I'm one of those people who feels I should like dark roasts more than I do, as I am always a fan of strong flavors in food and drink. But somehow dark roast coffees have always been more challenging than rewarding for me, and I usually end up retreating to the milder roasts.<br /><br />This is now my third order of Midnight Magic. The first time I ordered it I thought it was really terrific, but what really impressed me was that nearly everyone I made a cup for had the same reaction: they'd look surprised and say, "Wow, this is REALLY good coffee!"<br /><br />Dark roasts can so often just taste burned, but there truly is something different about this roast. It is rich and complex, as you'd expect. But it is never acidic or burned in flavor. I can finally say that I have found a dark roast that rewards rather than challenges.

review/summary: Gotta Love a Good Cuppa
review/text: I am a coffee drinker of the first order. I used to drink a couple pots a day, but now I've cut way, way back, so now that I'm not into quantity, I'm into quality. I really enjoy, really savior a good cuppa joe. I've given up my Mr. Coffee and now have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTR2F6">Keurig Home Brewing System</a> and I make my coffee a cup at a time and I really love it. It only takes a minute to make a cup and each cup is different, depending on my mood.<br /><br />I've been drinking K-cup coffee for a couple years now and have more of these little cups in my house than you can shake a stick at. For awhile I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JD3C9E">Chrome Carosel</a>, made by Keurig, but I had to keep filling it and also it was kind of clumsy for me. Besides, my coffee affliction is way to huge to be held down to a little spinning coffee merry-go-round.<br /><br />For the first few months my coffee problem went spinning out of control. I had boxes and boxes of coffee in my pantry, refrigerator, cupboards, garage, even in the trunk of my car, but now I've sort of got my gourmet coffee disorder in hand and down to twenty-eight flavors.<br /><br />For Breakfast I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Fair Trade Nicaraguan<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Midnight Magic, Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Kona Blend<br />Tully's French Roast Coffee<br />Coffee People Bold Black Tiger Dark Roast<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Morning Blend<br />Coffee People Coffee, Wake Up Call Bold<br /><br />For Lunch I have my favorite seven and they are:<br /><br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Hazelnut Coffee<br />Emeril's Big Easy Bold<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees Black Gold Extra Bold<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Private Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Extra Bold Parisian Nights<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Colombian La Vereda<br />Gloria Jean's Coffees GJ Special Blend<br /><br />And for dinner, yes I drink coffee in the evening as well, but that's not so bad, considering I don't drink, don't smoke, don't eat sweets and eat very little meat. Sometimes I'll eat meat, but not often, so a cup of coffee with dinner doesn't seem so bad, considering. If it kept me up at night, well then that would be different, but it doesn't. Anyway for dinner I'll drink one of these seven:<br /><br />Tully's Full City Roast Coffee<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Mudslide<br />Timothy's World Coffee, Italian Blend<br />Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic Extra Bold<br />Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend<br />Timothy's World Coffee, San Lorenzo Dark<br />Gloria Jean's Coffee, Classic Reserve<br /><br />And then there is my absolute favorite, number twenty-two and that is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HZH8NA">Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso</a>, a Timothy's World Coffee.<br /><br />I keep my little individual cup packages in three large assorted tupperware tubs, marked in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0TZO4">Sharpie</a>, of course, "Breakfast", "Lunch" and "Dinner". So when I reach into the breakfast tub for example, I never know which of the seven flavors I'm going to wind up with.<br /><br />I don't drink coffee during my meal, but afterwards, instead of desert. It's a quiet time for me. I think and reflect over my coffee as I delight in each and every sip.<br /><br />I know for some, having twenty-two different flavors of coffee in my kitchen might seem a bit much, maybe even a bit quirky, well everyone's gotta have their quirks, besides, I've cut way down.<br /><br />Now, about that twenty-second flavor. When I absolutely have to have an extra cup during that quiet, coffee drinking them, then that's the flavor I go for. How often does that happen, when one cup isn't enough? Only about once a day. Still, from two pots a java a day, down to four cups, is a pretty good thing, I'm not as wired as I used to be, but let's face it, I'm still running on caffeine. That's not so bad though, better a coffee crutch than something else.<br /><br />In my opinion these are the twenty-two best cups of joy in the whole wide world. At least the best twenty-two flavors I've come across in the hundreds I've tried. But please don't take my word as gospel, everybody's different. You have to dive right right in, take a chance, try several flavors till you find the one or the twenty-two that you like best.

It has a bold, rich flavor that is great any time of the day.<br /><br />I'm not a great coffee reviewer, so I don't have any fancy descriptions for this coffee - I just know I love it.  In fact, just to illustrate my uncouth coffee drinking habits, I've been known to put some Hazelnut syrup and/or raw cane sugar in it - obviously something no true coffee connoisseur would dream of doing.  But man, it sure tastes great.<br /><br />I've been drinking more Dark Magic since I've been unable to find Tully's French Roast on Amazon lately.  Or some other great brands...Come to think of it, I can't possibly be the first reviewer...maybe Amazon refreshed (pared-down/right-sized/simplified) the K-cups offerings.<br /><br />Sure seems to be a lot of Timothy's coffes available, though.  And that's not too bad.

review/text: I'm grinning reading the reviews as the only negative comments are the 'strong' flavor.  It is strong, but that is exactly what I was looking for while searching in the 'bold, extra bold' catagories.  This K-cup is my favorite because the taste and the smell are incredibly dense and earthy, not bitter but yes, bold.  If you like your coffee strong, dense, tasty and can handle lots of cream and sugar and still taste like coffee, this is your K-cup.  We gave my Mom a machine for Christmas and she prefers the light or medium blends, this one is way too much for her taste.  If you want to step down and still get a bold taste maybe try People's Donut Shop, they have matched the big donut shop's flavor and smell very well. Enjoy!

review/text: With my Keurig brewer, I enjoy trying many kinds of strong, full-bodied coffees.  The real test is in the ones I reorder.  Midnight Magic is my go-to favorite.  Very rich, true coffee flavor, not acidic or bitter.  When I take the first  sip of it in the mornings, I always say "Wow.  This is good coffee."  Need more be said?

review/summary: A bit too bitter for me, but drinkable at work
review/text: I tried this one (and still have some left) and feel it is a bit too bitter. I am going back to the Rainforest coffee. That may be too mild for some, but it seemed to have the right balance for me.

review/summary: Read the reviews but disappointing
review/text: I read all the reviews and was excited to get the coffee but after brewing my first few cups I must say this is not great coffee.  I love Peet's Major Dickason's and other more flavorfull well roasted coffee but the MM comes off heavy with charcoal, cardboard and a chunk of bitter without good aromatics or a complex pallate of flavors I enjoy in richer coffee.  I now have 46 more K-cups to work through.  Before you take the plunge and get a heap of the MM I highly reccomend a sampler pack, it may not be your favorite cup either.

review/summary: Disappointed
review/text: The sampler pack included with my Keurig included Green Mountain dark magic extra bold which was the best coffee in the pack. I bought Timothy's thinking it might be a cheaper equivalent. Have to say I've been disappointed. I'm struggling to get through one box and if I could return the other half of the two-pack I would. Newman's Own is better but I'll have to save my pennies for Green Mountain.

review/text: I like the extra bold varieties for the K-cups because you get more coffee taste.  However, the Midnight Magic offers too much bite.  The Extra Bold Rainforest Espresso is so much smoother.

review/summary: Glad I bought this one
review/text: I  got this on a Friday sale and saved!  I am really glad I trusted the reviews on this one.  Very smooth yet bold taste.  No sour or bitter aftertaste that many bold pods provide. I am actually normally a medium/mild coffee drinker, but I can fill a travel mug with this favor (using largest and then the smallest brew cycles back to back with the same pod) and I am still happy with the taste.  This is the primary reason I bought this flavor/strength. I intend on trying another Timothy's next time, maybe Italian blend?  Don't let the low price fool you, this is high quality coffee.  The same or better than Starbucks IMO for much less money.<br /><br />Tips for saving as much as you can.<br /><br />Check on FRIDAYS for sales!<br /><br />Use subscription service.  (You can cancel or change at any time, you can request an immediate shipment if you are about to run out before the next shipment)  you will be glad you did and you will want this coming every X number of months anyways.<br /><br />Enjoy, Enjoy Enjoy.

review/summary: Best extra bold of any brand
review/text: Have to agree with other reviewers, Midnight Magic is by far the best extra bold dark K-cup, and my favorite. Rich but not bitter, drink it black. Best of Timothy's and best of all brands in the extra bold dark category. There is a good reason that it is #1 seller today in coffee.

review/summary: The Best so far 6-10-08
review/text: I never was a coffee drinker until somewhere in my 40's I tried Starbucks extra bold. I thought, "finally, something decent to drink". I always thought coffee was watery before and never really liked it. I rcvd a Keurig Machine as a gift and the samples seemed watery, so I searched and found the reviews on Amazon. Based on those, I ordered the Timothys Midnight Magic. WOW, PERFECT is all I can say. My wife thinks it is way too bold, (but does agree out of all of my bold coffee's it is #1.) My friend tried it and the next week he had his own Keurig machine and Midnight Magic. I have at least 15-20 different types of k-cups in the cupboard, but my friends come over and always go past them to my Timothy's Midnight Magic. It is ridiculous, I tell them to drink the others so they will get used up before they get old, but to no avail. I will have to HIDE my Timothy's until the rest are gone!<br /><br />We stayed in a cabin with some friends and I brought a huge bag of Keurig K-cups with me with a large varity ( I also had about 10-12 Midnight Magic's in there). I figured everyone would try different flavors. Didn't happen, the REAL coffee drinkers honed in on my Midnight Magic before I noticed, and drank ALL of them. They didn't know they were MY Special stash....... FOR ME! oh well. I don't know how they figured out the Midnight Magic so fast, but once they had one of them, that was it.<br /><br />My wife loves the Gloria Jeans Coffee's - Toffee, Hazelnut, etc,,,,, and I will admit they smell great, just not enough flavor for me. I have also tried the Coffee People Black Tiger, (smells a little bitter) its OK, but I prefer the Timothy's Midnight Magic by a long shot. It has a very special after taste I have not been able to find anywhere else, and I love the smell of it. Rich, BOLD, flavor. I fill my cup with a small and then a medium using the same k-cup, and use half-n-half. (my friend drinks his Black and says it is perfect). I also like the Green Mountain Dark Magic and I can get those at the local Target store. (not as good as the Timothy's though, but still very good).<br /><br />Hopes this helps. If you like a nice bold cup of coffee, but NOT bitter, with an aftertaste I can't describe but everyone loves, than this is it.<br /><br />:)

review/text: Just finished a cup. I like a variety of Dark Roasts and always keep this one on hand. I almost always get Extra Bold k-cups because I use a 9.25 Oz. mug. You probably can brew 2 cups at the 5.25 oz. setting...but I would want the first cup. :)<br />This is one of the really good ones.

review/text: After buying my Keurig B60 I embarked on a search for the best K-Cup coffee.  After trying 8 or 10 different blends and brands, I believe that Timothy's Midnight Magic, Bold is the best.<br /><br />It brews a strong but smooth cup of coffee.  I even like the taste when selecting the larger (9.25 oz) serving size.  It holds up well with a little half-and-half.<br /><br />If you like strong coffee, I highly recommend Midnight Magic Bold.

review/text: After purchasing my Keurig several months ago, I've been busy trying different varieties of coffee to determine the "keepers."  Timothy's Midnight Magic is definitely a keeper!  It's the coffee I keep coming back to over and over again.  It has a rich, smooth flavor and is just what I'm looking for first thing in the morning.  I'm a Starbucks fan when I'm out, but when I'm home, Timothy's Midnight Magic is what I want if I'm looking for a great cup of regular, unflavored coffee.

review/text: After reading the many positive reviews for Timothy's Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, I decided to give it a try, even though I had been very satisfied with the dark roast Coffee People pods.  I'm here to say that Midnight Magic has become my favorite.  Unfortunately, these two brands are the only two that I can positively endorse, which is too bad.  I prefer a full-bodied coffee, but just never find it with the others.

review/summary: TIMOTHY'S MIDNIGHT MAGIC, EXTRA BOLD K-CUPS
review/text: I've been using this coffee, (Timothy's K-cups Midnight Magic, extra bold.) for about a year. This is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee of all K-cups. When we make it we use the small cup, but make a double small cup by lifting the lid a bit then closing it for the Keurig to recycle which makes one extra large cup, so be sure to use an extra large cup or it "shall runnith over". The coffee comes out excellent like this and is still a bit bold. We also use "International Delight" coffee creamer as it is non dairy (Great for us geezers with a lactose intolerent problem.) and we only use a much smaller amount to achieve the same lightness as milk, unless we use the fat free variey, in which case we have to use much more which waters down the coffee. For the litle bit that we use we can afford that tiny bit more fat in the creamer. This combination makes for a rich and bold cup of coffee. We order 3 double packs for a total of 144 K-cups each month.

review/summary: Dark, Rich & Extra Bold!
review/text: I like my coffee dark and rich, except for my first cup in the morning when I prefer a milder blend. After taste testing a variety of  different K-Cup dark roasts, including Green Mountain Extra Bold Dark Magic, Gloria Jeans Extra Bold Black Gold, Green Mountain EB Espresso Blend, and Timothy's EB Parisian Nights - Timothy's Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, stands well above the rest. It is made from specialty grade, certified Kosher Arabica coffee beans, so the box says. What really matters is how the taste fits the description, and this java is bold, dark, rich and exceptional with just a touch of sweet, not at all bitter or acidic. I brew it on the smaller size setting for a deeper taste.<br /><br />So, if you have a Keurig single serve coffee maker and your taste is similar to mine, Timothy's Midnight Magic, Extra Bold, is the brew for you. I know it's my favorite.<br />Jana Perskie

review/summary: My favorite K-Cup
review/text: I've been a coffee drinker for more than 30 years. I like mine black and usually prefer medium dark roasts. I bought a couple boxes of Timothy's Midnight Magic based on the reviews here and was not disappointed. It quickly became my favorite with Coffee People's Donut Shop a close second.<br /><br />When I want a strong cup of coffee using the largest setting on my Keurig B60, this is what I select. It's bold without being bitter and a surprisingly smooth-drinking coffee. While I usually can't stand the aftertaste of coffee, Midnight Magic has pleasant, almost clean aftertaste.<br /><br />What I like best about Midnight Magic is that I can use one K-Cup twice to fill my 16-ounce thermal travel mug (using the middle setting) and it provides the perfect coffee for my taste.

review/text: My husband and I are fans of dark, strong, black coffee...but hate bitter coffee (which dark, black and strong does not have to be).  Timothy's Midnight Magic is terrific.  We still have small issues with the K-Cups because they are obviously not ground and brewed from scratch.  But my husband loves the convenience and fun of brewing different tastes during the day (he works at home) without the fuss.  Timothy's blends are excellent.  We generally use the mid-level strength on our machine and found that works best for good flavor...

review/text: I drink only dark, strong coffee. I've had no success finding a k-cup that is even worth drinking prior to trying this one. I typically use the Cuisinart grind and brew with a dark and oily French roast bean. That is about the only way I have my daily coffee. I tried using the little filter in the Keurig with my own coffee, but it still would not come out strong enough. The k-cups are so convenient, and I am extremely happy that I can finally use that machine now that I've discovered this Midnight Magic blend.
