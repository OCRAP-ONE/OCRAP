review/summary: Crunchy & Good Gluten-Free Sandwich Cookies!
review/text: Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other "real" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true "chocolatey" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.

review/text: I loved these cookies when I first tried them, but found that in the humidity they will get soggy and gross if left open for too long.  Easily fixed with a Ziploc, but one time I tossed them in the fridge to keep them extra fresh.  That was when I fell IN love with these cookies.  When cold the creamy layers really hold up against the crunchy wafer and make a wonderful combination.  They are truly addicting.  Also, because we keep our entire house allergen free for my boys, these cookies are some that I can confidently serve when entertaining gluten-eating friends.  They often ask where they can get their own!

review/text: Well, my kid who isn't gluten free likes them, and my kid who is won't touch them.  I cook and bake most of what we eat, so desserts are very homemade and natural in their flavor.  These are really, really artificial-lemon flavored....they remind me of my dish soap every time I try one.  I really don't like the flavor, but the texture is nice.  I'm a little dizzied that I have so many boxes of something I don't care for... it was worth a try, though.

review/summary: Very good.  Also, they smell like potatoes.
review/text: I really shouldn't complain:  the world would be a sadder place without these.  They are like gluten-free Kitkats, which is wonderful.<br /><br />However, they also smell like potatoes.  The chocolate covers the potato taste and smell, for the most part, but, it's still a little bit like eating chocolate-covered crispy potatoes.<br /><br />However, as you are probably aware, there are variations in what people can taste and smell.  Personally, I can tell what vodka was made from--potatoes, wheat, whatever--even though it's so finely distilled that there shouldn't be any way to distinguish that.  If you're not super-sensitive to tastes and smells, you probably won't notice the potato at all, in which case, these would be fabulous.

review/summary: It's good junk food.  They also smell like potatoes.
review/text: First, let me say that I love this company.  They have somehow managed, with very difficult flours, to make normal junk food.  (These kinds of cookies are sold in American supermarkets in packages that are three times the size.)<br /><br />The packaging is pretty;  the cookies are crispy, light, and very appealing in your hand.  They are an exact duplicate of the wheat version.  However, once you get them up to your nose, you can smell the potato flour they are made from.<br /><br />Pull them away from your nose, and you have a very pretty cookie.  Bring them back in to your nose, and it's a surreally icky potatoey experience.  Cookies like this shouldn't smell like potato vodka.<br /><br />They do have a chocolate-covered version of this that you can't really smell, because the flour is covered. It's such a sugar rush that you may not care what it tastes like, particularly because it has an excellent chocolate-sugar-bomb wafer cookie texture.<br /><br />Just hold your nose.

review/summary: Beware of Glutino
review/text: My son and I who are both Celiacs loved Glutino wafers in both chocolate and dark chocolate varieties. We were on our 3rd box when I opened one of the bars and went to bite into it. It was the equivalent to biting into some sort of spongy rock. I immediately spit out what chocolate had fallen into my mouth while biting it. The bar itself seemed extremely stale to me. I went ahead and opened the remaining 3 bars in the box and the rest were normal. I also noted on the package that the product is made in Israel then processed in Canada, then sent to USA to be bought. It seems to me like one of the bars I had floated around a facility for quite some time before it was actually packaged and sent. Or worse who knows. I'm glad it was me and not my 3 year old son who bit into it.<br /><br />I tried contacting Glutino about what happened. I tried calling several times as well as sent messages via the internet. But no response. It went from being suspicious to down right scary, what are they hiding and if this is how they treat their costumers- how do they treat their food?<br /><br />Please be forewarned. Going gluten free isn't easy and Glutino is a big brand on the celiac's grocery list but since our incident we avoid Glutino at all costs.

review/text: I enjoy visiting a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market because they stock so many exotic gourmet items. It's a British company and a lot of their items are imported from the British Isles. For example, on this latest visit, I picked up a jar (12 ounces) of sliced beetroot that was nicely pickled. Mmmmm. They are just exceptionally good. We always called them pickled beets, and I haven't seen any for years and years. Well, these are a nice reminder. Not only are the beets themselves quite good, but the pickling juices are good for a refreshing drink.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/text: My kids love cranberry bread, as does my husband, but it's nearly impossible to find locally.  I was delighted to find this on Amazon.  The price is reasonable, and getting it delivered is great.  One variation you can make which my guys just love is to add 2 tsp of milk powder, and substitute orange juice for the water; adding a little orange zest gives it a little extra zip.  I also always add walnuts for flavor and nutritional boost.  I recommend this to any lover of quick breads or nut breads.

review/summary: Orange Cranberry Bread Mix
review/text: Over time (as is typical with manufacturers) the packaging of this product has changed as well as the name.  The emphasis is now on the "Cranberry" but I still love this bread.  I first tried it in 1996 and the thing that sold me was the great Orange flavor that was such a standout.  I've been buying this Bread Mix ever since.  However in the recent pass it never seems to be in the stores where I shop which is what prompted me to search it out on Amazon.  I am glad I found it there and was able to stock-up.  It's great fresh from the over or later, if you can keep it around for later.  It's good alone or spread with butter, or other favorite spreads.  And of course it's versatile - bread, muffins, or even pancakes, whatever you desire.  I usually add a little extra orange zest and chopped nuts...it's great! Oh, I think I smell it now!  Got'a go check my oven...

review/summary: Tasty but tiny, and fairly expensive.
review/text: I was extremely excited to order these bars after reading about the health benefits of chia seeds - the Health Warrior bars looked great.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed to find how small each bar is - maybe I should have looked at the product details more closely, but it turns out that each bar is VERY small (think about half the size of a luna bar) which was disappointing.  Luckily, at only 100 calories each, the small size was not a huge deal, I just found that I wasn't entirely satisfied after just eating 1.  The taste was great, but I'm a health nut and some people might find that the Health Warrior bars are not as sweet as traditional granola bars.  I will happily eat the rest of the box but will reconsider before buying again, especially considering the price.

review/summary: Price went up 20% with the new packaging and there is less Cinnamon
review/text: Barbara's Bakery hyped the new packaging but neglected to mention that the weight went from 12oz per box to 10 oz per box.  I use to purchase a 4 pack of the 12 oz old package for 15.57 and that works out to 32.4 cents per oz.  the new price for a 6 pack of the 10 oz box works out to 39 cents per ounce.  That's a 20% price hike in a period of low to no inflation.  Thanks for the nice new package guys.  I much prefer the old package at the old price and will be checking out other cereals with the intent of eliminating cinnamon puffins from my diet.<br /><br />The cereal also tastes different - not as good.  I looked at the ingredients and noticed that in both the old and new product there is 150 mg of salt.  However, in the old ingredient list cinnamon came before salt. In the new ingredient list it comes after salt.  Thus, there is less cinnamon in the new cereal. You can really taste the difference.  The old recipe was much tastier.  Again, my hat is off to Barbara's Bakery.  The price went up and the taste is not nearly as good.  Great job guys.<br /><br />January 20, 2011 Update:  I have replaced cinnamon puffins with other cereals.  Bring back the old taste which I loved so much and I'll buy again, even at the increased price.

review/summary: Reduced individual cereal, reduced taste, reduced box, increased price per oz
review/text: Puffin cereals used to be one of my favorites.  Cinnamon was my favorites among Puffin cereals.<br /><br />The new Puffin Cinnamon is not an improvement.  The size of each individual cereal was reduced.  But it appears they reduced not only the size but the formula of the cereal itself. I don't like the flavor as much, it appears to be sweeter and has less cinnamon.  The box size was reduced from 12 oz to 10 oz, thus becoming more expensive per oz.<br /><br />I am attaching two photos: The first photo shows the new packaging highlighting the reduced size.  The second photo show the ingredients and nutritional fact from the side of the box.  Puffin calories are shown using a serving size of 2/3 of cup, which is a pretty small portion. The box has 9 of those servings.  What I use as a serving is larger. For me each box has 4 servings. I noticed that cinnamon moved down on the ingredient list (when I compared it to the old box), which confirms my taste difference observation.<br /><br />With the new packaging you get something less tasty for more money per oz.  Barbara's Bakery - please bring back the old cereal!

I like them for snack or to carry in the car for nibbles.  I'm doing WWers and a serving is only 3 points and 2/3 cup (the serving-size) is plenty for either breakfast with milk or for an "I can't make it until supper" snack.  The cinnamon flavouring is "just right" and NOT overwhelming, which is something I have disliked with other cinnamon-flavoured cereals.  The puffs are fresh and crispy and not too sweet.<br />I think it's terrific.<br />I am about to try the peanut-butter and the pb and chocolate versions.

review/text: This cereal is wonderful. I literally ate an entire box in one sitting - not a common undertaking for me. I am all about natural, organic and whole foods, and so I generally don't eat much cereal unless I make it myself, but this stuff is awesome. It has a great cinnamon flavor, is not too sweet, and has a satisfying crunch even after it's been in a bowl of milk for a while. I don't remember what Puffins "used to" taste like, nor what the old box was like, or if the boxes were bigger; these factors seem to form a theme among the reviews of disappointed ex-Puffins lovers. I only know that I really like the way it tastes now. The peanut butter variety is also very tasty, but I'd advise you to stay away from the peanut butter and chocolate variety.

review/text: I used to buy these all the time. They tasted great, and I used them as snacks. The cinnamon taste wasn't overbearing, and it was great. It didn't have that overbearing corn taste either.<br /><br />Then they changed. Why? Money grubbing is one of the ways I would explain it. Why?<br /><br />1) They changed the size from 12 to 10 oz, like everyone else has done everywhere. (Notice that many major brand colas like coke and pepsi are changing to 1 liter to 1/4 smaller and raised the price.  It is important to realize a major factor here. Even though the media and government do not report any inflation, that is because they haved changed the very DEFINITION of inflation. All one has to do is go to the store to see this and the gas station. Look at BASICS like Milk. If people believe there is no "inflation", they just don't buy food. Coffee anyone?<br /><br />Yes I do not like it, but I see their reasons.<br /><br />2) They reduced the flavor significantly. Less cinnamon taste, starting to taste more like a corn cereal rather then the original reason I purchased it.<br /><br />So.... They reduced the amount you get, reduced the quality and primary ingredient you bought it for, and raised the price. That is inexcusable.<br /><br />Unfortunately, other cereals are doing the same thing, so we have to be VERY careful, read the labels carefully, the cost per ounce, etc. The bottom line also, if the kids don't like it, the price is too high, and you have to buy it more frequently. it is now off my list.  I recommend finding other alternatives.

review/summary: A winner in our home!
review/text: I have fed my dog dehydrated food as well as those frozen raw food tubes. I decided to try out the Addiction brand. I have tried the Venison, Lamb and Beef so far. My dog absolutely loves each one. After he has finished eating he comes running to me licking his face, his eyes all lit up, all excited. I find him licking his empty bowl over and over again. I've never seen this reaction with the other "natural" brands. This product lives up to its name! Addiction? you betcha!<br /><br />Warm water is added to this product. I let it sit a while till it is absorbed. I then fluff it up with a fork and serve. This  product does have a wonderful aroma. I must admit that I am tempted to taste it because it smells so good!<br /><br />I wish I had kept the box with the ingredients for the Venison to share it with you. I will when I reorder.<br /><br />Although this brand is a bit pricey, it well worth it.

review/summary: Raw Diet for Dogs
review/text: The Addiction brand offers a convenient way to introduce a raw diet to your canine family member. I have tried many of the flavors offered and my four dogs like them all. I use the Addiction dehydrated as a top dressing to my kibble, so this is not their only source of food. I soak it for 5 minutes, then fluff it up and serve it warm.<br /> My dogs have never looked better and I like knowing their source of protein is varied to prevent allergies.

review/summary: Not super impressed
review/text: I purchased the Wellness CORE canned for my highly allergic and dehydration-prone dog in order to try it out. I had reviewed the ingredients and liked that the first ingredients were fish (Salmon, Whitefish, Herring, Mackerel, Salmon Broth, Salmon Meal) and believed it to be a higher quality canned food than my dog's current canned food diet, which is Natural Balance L.I.D. Sweet Potato and Fish.<br /><br />My dog loves any fish-based wet food, so she well eat either with gusto. Although there is nothing necessarily wrong with the Wellness CORE, I was not super impressed by the quality, smell or appearance. The Wellness CORE is grayish and appears thick (less moisture). This may be due to the types of fish used in their formula. By contrast, the Natural Balance has a lot more moisture, probably due to the use of fish broth as the first ingredient, and is orange in color, probably due to the amount of sweet potato in their formula. Considering that the Natural Balance also has fish for 4 out of 6 of the first six ingredients (Fish Broth, Ocean White Fish, Sweet Potatoes, Salmon, Potatoes, Salmon Meal), has more moisture, is made specifically for allergic dogs, and is $10 (30%) cheaper than the Wellness, I have decided to stick with Natural Balance.

review/summary: Dogs love it and it is excellent for them!
review/text: Wellness Core wet dog food is great for dogs of all life stages. It has proper  nutritional content for puppies as well as adult dogs, which is not the case with most canned dog food. Whenever I feed my dogs the Wellness Core canned food, they devour their dinners. I almost always mix wet and dry food for them, and when I use Wellness Core canned food, they practically inhale their meals. I only feed my dogs products that are free of bad preservatives, by-products and animal digest. This product is top-quality food for dogs. A+++++

review/summary: Too much of the fruit; too little of the herbs
review/text: Whatever the orange fruit is (either persimmon or apricot or peach-- I cant tell!), there is too much of it and it overpowers the more subtle flavor of the blue bits, making this tea taste much like Casablanca and all the others with the orange bits in it. If you can get the orange fruit out, at least some of it, its a nifty tea. Otherwise, you can just buy any of the other teas that are similar (casablanca,tutti frutti, bella coola, etc) and they all taste the same.

review/summary: Reasonably good; cRc kosher certified
review/text: ...And with the example I'm looking at, $23.05 when you include shipping, hilariously overpriced from this vendor.  $3 a tortilla?  For this?  Bundled at a price point in the ballpark of what I see at Kroger I would be ordering some right now instead of writing a less than salutatory review of a product I frequently use.  I suppose there might be a tortilla that's worth $3 each in early 2012, but this is definitely not it. I'm not going to rate it on price, obviously -- that would be one star -- so my rating is assuming a reasonable price.  ...Even though as I type this there isn't.<br /><br />Two things I nit this product on are that it's often stiff and that the taste isn't as consistent as it could be.  As a vegetarian I still buy it.  The kosher certification on the back of the package makes it something I will consider when I won't consider other -- potentially better quality -- products with no kosher certification.  I can't really nit it for being non-organic when it makes no pretense of being such, but that's an additional negative for me.

review/text: The noodles come out just right - soft but with enough tooth to keep them from becoming mushy.  It's not spicy-hot at all, despite the photo of hot chilis on the lid.  It's the well seasoned chicken broth that makes even the little bits of TVP masquerading as chicken more palatable.  This is a great bargain and a terrific in-a-pinch office lunch.

review/summary: This is good!
review/text: I bought this locally because the price was so very right, and finally baked it because my wheat-eating boyfriend was threatening to make grilled cheese sandwiches in my kitchen to get his bread fix.  *shudder*  I love the guy, but who wants wheat in their gluten-free kitchen?<br /><br />This did the trick, and I really enjoyed it.  The ingredients are very simple, and I suspect a large range of food allergies and special diets would tolerate it as a result.  My box says: corn flour, corn meal, sugar, tapioca starch, baking powder, xanthan gum, flake salt, and baking soda, but as always, make sure to check YOUR box before eating anything.<br /><br />The texture, flavor, and color all came out well.  I *mostly* followed the instructions, but used soy milk for milk, and I added the dry mix to the wet liquid mix with a mixer instead of pouring the wet ingredients into the dry mix and folding everything in with a spoon as instructed.  It's faster, and I don't believe the quality suffered any as a result.<br /><br />If you're vegan or cannot tolerate egg, you'll have to use a substitute for the 2 eggs required.  This mix also requires 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup "milk" (see above for substitution).  It dirties 2 dishes and makes a dozen corn bread muffins or a typical 8x8 pan, for 12-ish servings.  Mine came out perfectly even though my gas oven insists upon being up to 100 degrees over the temperature I set it for.<br /><br />My only complaint is nutrition.  The nutrition info shows that one serving is 100 calories dry, but no one eats cornbread mix dry!  There's no nutrition info for the completed corn bread, so you'll have to do your own math if you're watching your calories.<br /><br />I'll have to stock up on this since it's on sale locally.  I hope you enjoy yours, too!

review/summary: This Stuff Works!
review/text: I am a life-long shift worker. For the past several years, I've been working the overnight shift in a stressful job. Sleeping during the day (usually early afternoon to mid-evening) is always difficult but more so when I'm stressed. I've been given prescriptions for sleep medications, which I have used and which work sometimes but other times have left me feeling not fully rested, like the sleep was artificial. I saw this here on Amazon, read the info (no sugar which is good because sugar for me is absolute poison) no calories, no carbs. I said "what the heck" and ordered some Serenity.<br /><br />To my utter astonishment, this beverage worked! I tried it out first time a few days after I received it. I took it about an hour before my usual bedtime. Within a half-hour, I started feeling VERY relaxed and before I knew it, I was asleep. Not only that, I slept straight through to the alarm clock sounding me awake! I thought, "FLUKE!"<br /><br />The next day, I did it again and had pretty much the same result. This time, I awoke once for a quick trip to the, uh, "john", but when I returned to bed, I fell right into sleep again (which is the other problem with prescription sleep meds that once I awaken for whatever reason, that's IT! No going back to sleep at all!).<br /><br />So, I've been using this product for the past two weeks with no discernible side effects, not even residual drowsiness once I get to work AND I've been sleeping 5-6 hours and feeling rested when I awaken. Which, to me, after years of sleep issues, is nothing short of astounding!<br /><br />I will perhaps update this review in the future, depending on whether or not this product loses its effectiveness with regular use (prescription meds do lose their effectiveness once the body acclimates to them, which has always meant that I stop taking them for a while which means not getting regular, uninterrupted, peaceful sleep which means being tired and worn-out which means life is not so much fun when I'm tired all the time).<br /><br />But, for now, I give Serenity Relaxation Beverage a thumbs-up, glowing review

review/summary: By far my favorite Maruchan flavor, EVER
review/text: This is by far and away my favorite Maruchan Instant Lunch flavor, ever. The ratio of lime to chili is fantastic, the (albeit microscopic) shrimp actually add to the texture, and most surprisingly the broth it creates is thick and delicious. Most of the time (chicken/beef/etc) I consider the broth to be just some liquid i have to drink in order to more easily get the rest of the noodles... not so with these. Drinking the broth was the best part!<br /><br />Pricewise, paying $13 for $12 of these when typical Maruchan Instant Lunches go for $0.50 individually at grocery stores seems pretty ridiculous, but then again this is a fairly uncommon flavor: the only other place I have seen this for sale was at 7-11, where they were going for $1.50 each.<br /><br />Try it. It's a little spicy... but you will *love* it.

review/text: I've had mixed luck with Dr. McDougall's line, generally like only about half of what I have tried, but lately things have been looking up.  When I tried these, my expectations weren't great, but I was surprised.  These were really very tasty and quite easy to prepare.  The noodles had an excellent consistency and body.  The sauce was good and spicy, but not too spicy.  I could have eaten about twice as much (big guy talking here), but I found there was just enough to satisfy me for a quick lunch when I added a fruit side dish.<br /><br />The neat thing is that this is good enough that I will be looking forward to having it again.  That's pretty good for an instant noodle cup type product.  If you do the "subscribe and save" the price is competitive.  I don't give 5 stars lightly, but I think this one deserves it.  Not as good as local, but excellent for an instant product.

review/text: i will start off by sayin the dr. mcdougall brand is a life saver for me. being a vegan it can be difficult to find really quick and easy meals. i was scared to buy all of them at once, so at my local store i got one of every flavor. they are all tastey but to me this one stood out. the flavor is awesome. i cook it differently than the package says ( i do that for all of them).<br /><br />the only problem i have with the asian entrees is that it is 200 calories per serving and there is two in a cup. noone is only going to eat half of it. that would just be a bad idea. other flavors have less calories per serving. and at my local store you can get it for the about the same price per container. i know that might be location dependant because when i lived in a different state it was cheaper to get it here. i know with the subscribe and save it always works out to get it on amazon. i keep these in my car because i never know if i need a meal on the go. these are super handy and super tastey. i would recommend any of them.

review/summary: Easy fast food on the go
review/text: I've tried several different Dr. McDougall noodle and soup entrees and this is one of the better ones.  They're easy to make, Just peel back the foil covering from the top of the cup, add the flavor packet that's inside and stir a bit.  Add water to the fill line and microwave for 1 minute and 45 seconds.  Then stir and let stand for 5 minutes.  You could also add boiling water to the fill line and then let it stand. I added more water than suggested to make it more of a soup and this seemed to work out well.  They aren't as spicy as I like so I added a few drops of Tabasco.<br /><br />I like that these are vegan and that they're easy to store in the pantry for when you don't know what else to make or when you're in a hurry.  They would also be good to take along when traveling and could easily be made in a hotel room with hot water from the coffee maker on if you have a microwave in your room.  They're 200 calories per cup, so they could also make a quick diet lunch or dinner, maybe paired with a green salad.

review/text: I am kinda a noodle-bowl connoisseur. I've eaten lots of different ones at lunch over the years. The flavor of these bowls are noticeably better than other brands. Needless to say I am a big fan. The bowls have enough food to fill me up fine, but probably won't satisfy my husband. Also its not very spicy. I always end up adding a good amount of Sriracha. But that's just me. I recommend.

review/summary: Not as good as I hoped
review/text: Container is the round cup style, not the bowl style picture when I ordered. Noodles are a good cut and texture. Dried veggies are not as small as some (positive) with some decent mushroom pieces. However, the overall taste is not good enough that I could recommend or that I would buy again. I am basically saving the remainder for when I run low on groceries and for an emergency stash.

review/summary: Vegan Cup of Noodles
review/text: There are times when I want a cup of noodles.  They are quick, easy and normally inexpensive.  However, when I became a vegetarian over 20 years ago and made the gradual progression to veganism is became harder to get inexpensive quick fixes for lunches.  Then to top it all off we moved to an area where meat and cheese seem to dominate the menus of area resturants.  Now, our local HEB has finally started carrying two varieties of these soups.  One is the spicy szech and the other is the pad thai.  Now, I can buy some of these and leave them in the locker at work for a quick lunch/dinner.  They are more than the traditional ramen but they are vegan and somewhat healthier.  The portion is small but that is a portion.  If it was larger I might eat more and I am trying to loose some weight so I couple it with some toasted seaweed snacks.  For a vegan alternative to ramen noodles they are very good.  If you are comparing it to a descent szech resturant then it probably won't be as good.  It is good for what it is which is an instant noodle.  The subscribe/save makes it an even better value since it is an item I would use regularily.

review/text: I was looking for noodles that were low in calorie with an ingredient list I could read. On top of it all, these taste great!

review/summary: Good for a packaged convenience food
review/text: Make no mistake... this is a pre-packaged, instant convenience food. That said, it's quite good for what it is. Also easy to make: add water, microwave one minute on high, stir, microwave 4 minutes on low. I prefer that method to the microwave 2 minutes, let stand 10 minutes directions of many other Dr McDougall's soups. Unfortunately, my microwave doesn't have a high or low setting so it was just a little dry by the end of the last 4 minutes. I'd probably do 2 or 3 minutes for the second microwaving and see how that goes next time.<br /><br />I also think the packaging is a little misleading. It looks similar to the packaging of products like Annie Chun's Udon Soup Noodle Bowl in which you have more of a bowl or meal tray that contains noodles and flavor or sauce packets. It is in fact a soup cup to which you add water and flavor powder. I assumed the higher price (vs regular Dr McDougall's soup cups) and the description of 'Entree' meant it would be more like the former, with actual noodles and sauce. The noodles are much more like ramen noodles.<br /><br />That aside, the flavor is good, though I much prefer the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040WCQKQ">Dr. McDougall's Right Foods Asian Entree, Spicy Kung Pao Noodle</a> flavor, as it's a bit spicier (though still fairly mild for someone who likes things very spicy).<br /><br />Not bad but I probably won't be reordering.

review/summary: Why the Big Cup?
review/text: The noodles are quite good, but what's up with the packaging?  You fill the cup half way with water, so why does the cup have to be that size?  I know that Dr. McDougall's makes soups in smaller sizes, so it's not like they have to get all new equipment.  Plus, each cup is encased in a stiff paper stock package; such a waste!  The instant soups by this company have no such excess packaging, why do the noodles?

review/summary: Lower salt.......yehhhhhh!
review/text: I love Ramen chicken noodle soup but it was always way too salty to eat more than once a week.  With the decreased salt content in this packaged soup, I can eat it more often.  It really does not taste lower in salt but the label says it is.  I wish more soups lowered their salt content.  I buy Amy's soups because they are truly low salt but they are also rather expensive.  And, like I said, I love Ramen chicken noodle soup so I do recommend this soup but it's still a little too high when compared to Amy's or other more healthful soups. With us consumers requiring lower salt in our foods with our purse strings, maybe the big companies will get the hint.  This soup is quite delicious but read the label before you buy it!

review/summary: Why not just reduce the sodium of regular flavors?
review/text: I've tried this low-sodium variety and it had a surprisingly "peppery" taste that I did not care for. Also, you can reduce the sodium content of other flavors by only using half or two-thirds of the seasoning packet. You will get more flavor, but end up consuming as much sodium - sometimes even less, depending on the variety - than you would if you ate this low-sodium kind  with its entire seasoning packet.<br /><br />Ramen has an unfair bad reputation. Use less of the seasoning, add some leftover frozen vegetables, maybe toss in pieces of leftover chicken or cooked bacon, and you've gotten a decent small meal. I'm not saying that you should live off of Ramen only, but Ramen recipes have gotten my husband and I through some financially-tough months in the past.

review/summary: The Best Reese's Ive ever had!!!
review/text: <span class="tiny"> Length:: 0:33 Mins<br /><br /></span>Im a candy lover from way back, i love candy and i love Reese's. But for me, I can onlt eat a Reese's a certain way, the chocolate rim needs to be a liitle hard, and the peanut butter needs to be fresh and a little soft. That just a tough combo to find. The best time is during the colder months. During the summer, forget it, they melf, sticky, just a pain, plus the chocolate shell is always soft, and that kills it for me. Then years ago, I found the minichures, those were great, but a pain because each one had the foil and the paper cup to mold the esge. But those just seemed to be the perfect balance that I loved. Then again, it came down to the temperature, hot, there soft all over, no good. Then, about 2 months ago, im in Walmart, and one of the worker said, "hey if you like resees'. check these Mini's out, there real ggod. I figured they would be to small, and just another pain because of the paper cup. He said, "no cup, there small, but the perfect size, and there just great!". Well, I bought 2 bags because they were on sale. The next thing I know, im at Walmart 2 days later wanting to buy more, but they were gone!!!! I was mad because these things are great, and they had a huge display of them, and the other flavors that had come out, but they were gone. mI said no way, they must have some in the store, and they did, but the workers had hid them, they knew they were running low, and put the units they had left on the highest shelf of the display, all the way in the rear of the other candies!!!!! They had some left, but they knew that when they came in to buy more, they would surely be gone, and they thought knowbody would be creazy enough to look all the way back there. Guess what, they didnt know I was coming for more.<br />Needless to say, my friends and I purchased the remaning supply they had in the store, but they ended up receiveing a huge inventory of them in the following days and seem to have not run out of them in the last few weeks, but you never know, thats why I bought some on here. I was worried a little because its already been in the 80's here in Las Vegas, so I wasnt sure if they would melt a little being on the truck all day, but no problem at all. They came in just as fresh and as chilled as they noramlly do from the local store. More costly here, but at least I know they are coming!!!<br />Here are a couple photos so you get the real size of them and how they really are!!!

The reason I can't give them five stars is because even though the advertisement does not list "high fructose corn syrup" as an ingredient, the actual nutrition label does. This is an ingredient that I try not to have in my food, but it is getting very difficult to find products that don't contain it.

review/summary: Non-Fat Dessert
review/text: While not readily available in many markets, the fat free fig newtons are an excellent dessert alternative for those trying to lower chlosterol without drugs. Very tasty and satisfying. The price and free shipping save us about 30% at Amazon compared to the Safeway market. Almost time for another case!

review/summary: Ingredients list: Read it and weep.
review/text: Whole Grain Wheat Flour, Figs Preserved With Sulfur Dioxide, Sugar, **Corn Syrup, **High Fructose Corn Syrup, Soybean Oil, **Partially Hydrogenated Cottonseed Oil, Salt, Cultured Dextrose And Potassium Sorbate Added To Preserve Freshness, Baking Soda, Soy Lecithin (Emulsifier), Natural And Artificial Flavor. Vitamins And Minerals: Tricalcium Phosphate (Source Of Calcium And Phosphorus), Ferric Phosphate (Source Of Iron And Phosphorus), Niacinamide, Vitamin A Palmitate, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride (Vitamin B6), Riboflavin (Vitamin B2), Thiamine Mononitrate (Vitamin B1).<br /><br />**The HFCS and trans-fat in these outweigh any positives from the whole wheat and figs. Too bad! These could have been a great, tasty choice, but instead they turned out to be little nuggets of poison. Consider yourself warned.

review/text: It's a ton of fig newtons so how can you go wrong. If you've never had a Fig Newton then you owe it to yourself to try them. It is its own unique flavor and texture.

review/summary: Perfectly portable snack
review/text: I have to stay for long hours at school, and I've been looking for snacks I can bring that aren't too unhealthy. When I found out about these fig newton minis, I was pretty excited since I absolutely love the full size fig newtons. Since they're smaller, there is of course much less of the fruit filling.. but still, a delicious snack. The size of each individual bag is quite small (a little over 1oz) so it's not too great at staving off those hunger pangs, but it helps.
