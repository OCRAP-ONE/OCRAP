review/summary: Great Product
review/text: My Border Collie mix 7 month old puppy loved these treats. I used them for training and playing games with my puppy like "find the treat". I would order these again but I've switched my pup to Pup Corn treats made locally, cheaper and healthier too but still eats milk bone biscuits. The free I.d tag is promotional is a pretty good deal and I plan to order Oreo one.

review/summary: My dog never tires of eating these treats...
review/text: This pack of six boxes is a great bargain.  Although I've been trying to buy more nutritional and healthy treats, I still keep a stash of these because my dog likes them.  I would be happier though if the manufacturer didn't use artificial coloring, and I'm somewhat suspicious of the little pieces of hair I've seen embedded in the "marrow" part.  I haven't seen any bugs that other reviewers have mentioned.

review/summary: Good Tasty Treats
review/text: These are nice, small treats that my dog enjoys very much. Only reason that it gets 4 stars rather than 5 is because of the "great for training" call on the box. As one reviewer already said, these really aren't very good for training. They are too big to work well - the dog looses focus and they are too crunch to cut up and use in smaller bits. However, with that being said, my dog loves these! I'll continue to pick them up as general treats or as a big treat at the end of a training session.

review/summary: GOOD TREAT FOR MY LAB
review/text: We got these for my fiances lab (my lab too thru him) and we use them as occasional treats and for training purposes. For some reason, I thought they'd be bigger than they were, but I'm okay with the size that they are. I read that some people had bugs in their boxes, no bugs here!! Thank goodness!! She likes these treats, but she also eats deer poop in the backyard and anything on the floor, sooo I can't guarantee that the taste is great, but if she eats them, then that's all that matters! LoL. As humans, we'll never know, and I'm not trying them!

review/summary: My dog says bleh
review/text: I've never found a dog biscuit my little Maltese likes so I knew I was taking a chance. Still,  I'm VERY disappointed that there are no returns for the 11 unopened boxes.  I wouldn't try them if you have a finicky dog or a small eater. They are bland. There's no tasty smell, I mean nothing. The cardboard box smells as appetizing. I realize my dog is hard to please so I won't blame it all on MilkBone. He's not a big eater and has never been a chewer (never chewed on furniture, shoes etc) so although he won't grab ANY bone, he does enjoy them. Most beef bones are too large but he crunches lamb or pork rib bones up completely.  There must be SOME kind of biscuit to keep a small eater's teeth healthy.

review/summary: One of my favorite snacks! Great for people with nut allergies.
review/text: Wasabi peas are essentially roasted green peas with a light coating of mild wasabi (Japanese horseradish) on them. Since I have an allergic sensitivity to most kinds of nuts, I eat these as a snack when other people might be eating nuts. These peas have a bit of a kick but not too much, they are great with beer when watching football on TV. Just be warned, these snacks are addictive and if you like them you'll wish you had bought more! One tip: always buy cans or foil packets of these as in some stores they have loose "bulk" peas in clear plastic bins and they are terrible. Trust this maker and Kasugai as well.

review/summary: Best Iced Tea ever
review/text: I have been using Sportea now for only 6 months or so.  I have been buying in bulk to save on cost and have noticed that my 2 quarts/day 5 or more times a week really do make me feel better, sort of.  It is not like caffeine or sugar as it does not make you hyped up only to crash later.  It is more like a smooth constant boost.  It does not come on strong so I did not notice it at first.  However I can tell the difference now, as can my wife, when I drink a bottle of it and when I do not.  When I do I have more stamina and energy, not in great amounts, just enough to be noticeable.<br /><br />But what I really like is that it is not soda, it is not plain water and it does not have caffeine, sugar or high fructose corn syrup in it.  No taurine or other engergy drink additives, just good satisfying cold tasty tea.<br /><br />The taste is widely variable.  If you find that you do not like it try to leave it "steeping" for a differnt amount of time.  I have found that I like it best between 6-9 hours in the fridge.  That is another thing do not steep if not in the fridge, it will taste bad look funny if you do.  Steeping longer than 10 hours also makes it bitter and mellows out some of the better flavors, so if you don't like your tea bitter and tasteless do not leave the tea bag in more than 10 hours.  Any less than 4 hours and the flavor is barely even there at all.  4-5 hours and there is a stronger flavor but weak color and weak overall flavor, meaning that some of the flavor has leached out but not all of it.  Between 6 and 8 hours seems like the sweet spot, sometimes I do it overnight and it goes for 9 hours and it is still OK, but I pull the bag out as soon as I can when I get up.<br /><br />I have taken this hiking, camping, climbing, kayaking, etc.  As long as it is prepared right and the bag is removed it will keep its flavor as long as it does not get too warm, so I have found that it works best to use it within the first day out if you plan to use it outdoors.  Then again maybe you prefer it warm, it is a whole different taste.<br /><br />I also do not encourage you to use hot water on the cold bags, it always seems to taste aweful when I make it hot.  I have not tried the hot bags, as they are smaller they may mellow the bad taste of this tea when hot.  I don't know, but I suggest not using the big bag for hot tea.<br /><br />Thats about all I can say for this.  I would be happy if it also included some of the grean tea properties of staving off hunger, but sadly to say this has had no effect on my appetite.  It does howover seem to relax me, probably more of a comfort thing at this point though.  It also really does quench my thirst better than other drinks for better or worse.  I cannot comment on it nutritious value except that it does have good stuff in it and as far as I can tell no bad stuff.

review/text: Sportea is the answer to a healthy daily drink.  It is the only thirst-quenching, great tasting drink/tea that I can drink all day and not get the adverse effects you get from a can of soda or regular caffine-loaded iced tea.  It has ZERO calories, very little caffine, ZERO calories, lots of electrolytes and vitamin C, ZERO calories, a sweet refreshing hint-of-citrus flavor, and ZERO calories!  I Drink about a gallon a day, so I am a big fan.  I just wish they would bottle it!  <p>(SPORTEA JUNKIE TIP: take a large cup, like a big-gulp cup, and put a Sportea Iced tea bag in the bottom, cover with some ice and add water to the top.  Let the Sportea steep for about 15 min. and then you are ready for guilt free sipping all day.  yum....:)

review/text: It is very good tuna, the package is hillllarrious! No Tuna in nature is as white as that photo on package perhaps maybe the rare, ever so elusive, albino tuna. If you have purchased Tuna in a pouch before then you know that this in reality, looks like beige colored canned tuna smashed flat. But it forks up into chunks or more like flakes.<br /><br /> It has virtually no water added but is not too dry, has a very mild taste, and is very convenient in the 1 serving pouch. It has 80 calories and is a decent source of Omega-3 EPA and DHA with 190mg of those combined in each serving, not a whole lot, but very good.  I would buy again but only on sale as it's really only worth a buck twenty five each for these 2.5 ounce servings.

review/summary: My dog loves it!
review/text: We just recently added a corgi to our family, and I started researching different types of wet and dry foods for our pup. After trying different raw diets, we eventually settled on the Weruva brand of dog food. Our local pet store recommended it to us, and the girl working actually opened up a can and started eating it! It's processed in Thailand, and before that scares anybody, you have to realize that the food processing laws in Thailand are MUCH more strict than in America (read it up online!). They are not allowed to process by-product in their pet food, or use filler product. Weruva definitely does not have any of that--you can actually eat the dog food and it'll taste just like dinner.<br /><br />Our boy has a sensitive stomach and he's a very picky eater. The first night we got him the regular Chicken with Gravy he ate that whole can up. He loved it, and when we tried feeding him anything different he refused. Then we ordered him the Kobe Master flavor and it quickly became one of his favorites. I'd definitely recommend this brand, especially coming from a very concerned dog owner. I won't feed my dog anything else.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: Please ignore the 1 star review.  That's an Amazon mistake and this terrific dog food doesn't deserve a one star because of an Amazon tagging error.  Weruva is one of the only genuinely human grade dog food products available.  My three pugs had totally gone off their food for days until I tried this brand .... I was going to buy Merrick (which they don't like very much) and found this instead.  It is spectacular.  Doesn't even smell like dogfood.  And, Amazon's price is very reasonable compared to my local retailer.  THIS IS A GREAT DOGFOOD PRODUCT and really worth trying out if you are an animal lover.  BTW - I now give it to my cats too and they are the fussiest eaters in the world -- they love it too.

review/summary: She'd stand on her head for this!
review/text: I ordered both this type and the Paella for our Akita, and I have to say hands down, this is the only food that she gets excited about about EVERY time. She is a picky eater, and sometimes the other food, has to be put in the refrigerator because I don't want it to spoil. I don't give her this "flavor" all the time though, because I want it to be more of a reward type meal. Have not tried the Kobe flavors yet, but am looking forward to...am waiting for the economy to pick up a bit more to try these ones just in case she is not as crazy about these as she is the pork version.

review/summary: Makes my dogs sick
review/text: While the ingredients look good (though the water content is 80% while most of the better brands have 78%) this food has managed to get two of my dogs sick!  Vomiting and uncontrollable bowel movements.  One dog is 17 yrs old and the other 4 yrs old.  I stopped feeding the older girl this food some time ago but discovered I still had cans so I gave a can to the 4 yr old.  After two days on the food he became sick.  He is now on rice and chicken for the next few days.  I cannot recommend this food to anyone.

review/text: I switched my kitties to Weruva a few months ago, and I'm so happy with this product. The food looks/smells/feels like actual chicken a human would eat, and the kitties love it. While they've always been healthy cats, their coats have gotten even shinier since I've started feeding them an all-wet diet (including Weruva), and they're maintaining a healthy weight and activity level. I'd highly recommend this food to other pet owners, and Amazon's price (with the free shipping) is the best I've seen.

review/summary: decent dog food, but Fromm's is better
review/text: This brand is not bad, the ingredients are all good. However, compared to Fromm's canned dog food, I was not impressed. There seemed to be more liquid in the can and the can was not as full. Also, my puppy's stool turned more runny after eating this. I did not have this problem with the Fromm's canned food which definitely was more solid and less liquid. I give the company credit for using quality ingredients but the food truly looked more watery and filled with liquid. Maybe that is good for cats but I tried their dog food for our puppy.  I will go back to Fromm's and exchange the remaining cans of Weruva.

review/text: I love Weruva for my dogs, let me say that up front. I ordered 2 cases of this food, and out of 24 cans FIVE were usable. The rest were so badly dented that they were opened and molded. When I tried to return it, I found that This food has a NO RETURN policy. I ended up paying more than $10.00 a can for those 5 cans. NOT ACCEPTABLE. I have been ordering my dog food through Amazon for some time, and this shipping problem is getting worse. Much of the product arrives dented, but unopened. Instead of throwing money away like this, I will pay a little more and pick it up myself! Buyers, please be aware of this NO RETURN policy!!!!

review/summary: Good food, easy delivery
review/text: I have two small-ish dogs (both should weigh about 12-15 pounds each), who are 9 and 11 years old. Feeding them never used to be an issue; we used a nice quality dry food, and they ate out of one bowl together. A few years ago, though, one of them became dangerously ill, and is now diabetic with heavy cataracts in both eyes, so being sure she gets enough to eat at the right times has become much more important. I mix a quarter of a can with a half cup of our dry dog food for each dog twice a day. This gives both of them the right calories (the other dog is more plump because when food falls, she is the only one who can see it!), and the wet food ensures that my diabetic pup eats everything in her bowl. Amazon's price is better than what I pay locally, and it arrives sooner than what the delivery-by date is.

review/summary: My pup's favorite brand of canned food
review/text: My pup, a corgi/chi mix who rarely gets people food yet somehow is so very picky, LOVES weruva. He has tried other very high quality brands and has now been turning his nose up to those after he has tried this. He has so far tried and loved the paw-lickin chicken, grandma's chicken soup, and wok the dog.  These are especially great if you like to have something to mix in with kibble because they have a good amount of sauce in it, though not too much in my opinion to feel like you're getting jipped.<br /><br />I have not yet purchased them from amazon so I cannot comment on the shipping quality.  Although I have bought online elsewhere and it arrived via fedex, some a little dented but all cans still useable.  Glad to see weruva is on amazon, will have to order from here next time I need to purchase.

Some of them tend to get picky when they're nursing, but this brand of food is always more than appreciated by my little mamas.  :) I would like to explain just a bit further.  My largest expense with my show dogs is for their top quality food, even more costly than our vet expenses!  If my spoiled fur family loves this food, I, for one, am convinced it's a top-notch product. I wish it were cheaper, but all things considered, it's an acceptable price for the quality.

review/summary: Great product overall
review/text: Summary: Great (if kind of gross) product for distracting my puppy, but there is a slight choking hazard.<br /><br />My crazy but adorable Boston Terrier is extremely high strung and suffers from separation anxiety. These sticks were recommended to us in order to help distract her while we are away from home. When I first gave her a bully stick, she immediately waltzed off with it and proceeded to find somewhere to "bury" it; which was fun because she had never done that before with a treat. Now I find bully sticks in the laundry hamper, under my pillow, between the couch cushions, and other strange places (she once tried to hide one under my arm, which really didn't work out too well for her). When she gets around to chewing on one, she happily munches away. Between the "hiding" and the chewing, Chompers is occupied for quite some time. The sticks look really nasty once they have been used for a while, but they don't smell or leave marks on the carpet.<br /><br />Now for the down side: While safer than rawhide, these treats do occasionally choke my dog. The hard stick turns soft and stringy when chewed on for long periods of time. Since the dog can't really bite the stringy stuff off (hard to explain unless you see it), she will try to swallow stringy stuff attached to the remainder of the stick and choke on it when it gets caught in her throat. This is not a problem when I am home because she get my attention when it happens and I can pull the stringy stick parts out of her throat. When we leave the house, we have to make sure all the stringy bits are cut off of her sticks so she won't choke while we are away. I don't know if anyone has had similar problems (please let me know if you have found solutions!!!) but it was a little scary at first to see her choking. I'm not sure if she would be able to resolve the choking situation without our help.

review/text: I've been taking my one-year-old jack russell/basenji pup to dog classes and thus train with him pretty regularly. I've been trying out all kinds of treats to train him with and this one, by far, takes the cake. I call these bully sticks my "magic wands" because I practically control his every movement with the stick until he gets it. My pup will do ANYTHING to get one! I started with the smaller order (10 sticks) because I wasn't sure if he'd like them, but I have no hesitation about ordering them in the largest bulk I can now. And to top it all off, they're mess-free, unlike many other chews out there.

review/summary: Pooch Is Happy
review/text: So far, our Cairn is happy with the purchase. He absolutely loves bully sticks, and we like the teeth cleaning factors they offer. Our dog is what we call a "Super Chewer". Once he gets a bully stick, he can't leave it alone until it's finished. With the Downtown Pet Supply bullies, it takes about one hour for our dog to chew it down to a 1-1/2" piece. Considering how much our dog loves to chew, I don't feel like the bully wears down too quick. We typically give our pup a break at the 30-minute mark so the bully lasts several days. We try to steer clear of giving him too much protein all at once.<br /><br />What we do like with the DPS bullies is the size. DPS claims they are 6" sticks and they don't disappoint. Out of the entire 18 pack, we didn't find one under 6 inches so they aren't skimping on product.<br /><br />In the past, we've bought the expensive bullies from Petco, but we feel these are by far the best value. For the most part, they don't stink too bad. We can't speak to the claim they are free range, but the good news is they don't reek like a barn full of bulls! What really matters is we will buy these again and couldn't find a reason to give them less than 5 stars!

The small dog is finicky; he likes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00106ZXU0">Nylabone Nutri Dent Edible Dental Chew, 36 Count Extra Value Pack</a>  The larger dog likes the bully sticks.  So, I give the nylabone to the small dog, and he is happy; and I give the bully stick to the larger dog, and he is happy.  The bully stick lasts for an hour or longer.  It is something natural for him to chew-on, and it  helps to keep tartar and plaque down.  I give it to him every 3 days or so.<br /><br />There is an odor to them when I open the bag to take one out.  When they are sealed in the bag, you can't smell them.  When the dog is chewing on it, you can't smell it.  And they don't leave residue on the carpet or furniture.<br /><br />They come in different sizes and quantities.  Here is a larger size: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MA04LY">12" BULLY STICKS - Large Select Thick - Dog Chew Treats, 12 inch (4 Pack), by Downtown Pet Supply</a><br /><br />You can also buy these directly from DogStuff4u (which I did); just Google that name; they have free shipping too.  After going to their website, just click the "bully sticks" link.<br /><br />For further dental care, I also use the following item in my dogs' water: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OVBAP8">Pet Dental Liquid Tartar Remover Liquid 16 Fl OZ</a>

The problem is he can go through these at a rate of one a minute.<br /><br />If you are looking for small bullysticks these will suffice, but you can find them for far less elsewhere.  If you are looking for sticks bigger than a pencil, keep look elsewhere.

review/text: Our dog loooooves bully sticks, and they are great for keeping him occupied when we need to get work done around the house.  These bully sticks seem to be high quality and last as long as other brands.  All bully sticks are pretty stinky, however we thought these sticks were stinkier than our usual brand Cadet.  The Cadet brand sticks all smell the same stinky way - however, some of these sticks smelled like regular bully sticks and some smelled like poop.  YES POOP.  More than once I had to do a shoe-check to see if I stepped in some doo, but nope - no doo, just these sticks.  I guess we would purchase these again if they were considerably less expensive than Cadet, but otherwise, we probably wouldn't.... not because they aren't decent sticks... but because they are extra stinky.

review/summary: What a joke.
review/text: I'm not sure what is considered Thick Select...sounds like an industry term, but I received 10 bully sticks and most of them were barely thicker than a pencil.  I don't associated pencils with being thick and these bully sticks are better suited to a Pomeranian then my German Shepherds.  I seldom complain about products but when its completely misrepresented, I have no choice but to warn others.  If there is a way to leave a picture, someone leave me a comment on how too and I will.

review/summary: Smelliest bully stick ever!
review/text: Although our dog loved the taste of these bully sticks, they smelled to high heaven.  I know that bully sticks aren't supposed to smell like roses, but these things were the worst!  It smelled like the worst case of foot funk ever.  I thought that maybe if I aired them out it would be better, but that did not help.  Our dog was so excited to have this treat, but in the end, we threw them all away because we couldn't handle the odor any longer.

review/summary: My dog loves them - and they are thicker than a pencil
review/text: My dog loves these bully sticks. I read some reviews saying they're "pencil thin," which I don't think is accurate. The sizes vary and some are thicker/thinner than others, but even the thinnest of the batches I've purchased so far have not been as thin as your typical #2 pencil. I'd say a thin one would be about the size of two pencils taped together, or maybe the thickness of two Twizzlers.<br /><br />I recommend storing them in an airtight container or Ziplock bag or something like that, because they are smelly...and probably smell scrumptious to dogs.

review/text: We have two twenty pound dogs, and they love these.  Other reviews complained about the thickness, but these were much thicker than the ones we've purchased from the local pet store and the grocery.  Maybe two or three of those combined to make one of these.  One keeps our girls busy for an hour or more.<br /><br />The only down side is that they really do smell terrible -- at least to humans!  Good ventilation in the area is crucial.

review/summary: Excellent!
review/text: I recently got a miniature Australian Shepherd puppy, and he's been teething a lot due to his baby teeth coming in.<br /><br />I'd read that rawhide is generally not recommended, as it can upset a dog's stomach. I read statements by Cesar Milan and others that bully sticks were preferable to rawhide.<br /><br />These bully sticks are great!  My puppy seems to prefer them to his chew toys as his number one chewing item...  He will chew on one for an hour, and it seems to help his teething and some anxiety. They do have a slight smell, but nothing overpowering, and his strong preference for them makes it well worth it. They also seem to last a very long time (after a week or so, we are still on the first stick, and it looks to last at least another week or two).<br /><br />I did notice today that on rare occasions, the dog can pull at thr side of the strip and get a stringy bit that's probably more than he should swallow...  This very rarely happens (ive only seen it once in a week), but it goes without saying, if possible keep an eye on the dog while he's chewing on these, just in case.

review/summary: My Dogs Love It!
review/text: My two little doggies love these bully sticks. My peke-a-poo is a ravenous chewer so usually he finishes first whereas my bischon frise likes to take his time with it, not to mention the time he takes to find someplace to bury it before actually chewing it. Most of the time it'll take my peek-a-poo maybe an hour to an hour and a half to finish his off while my bischon frise takes maybe three hours to do so, unless my peek-a-poo steals it from him.<br /><br />The bully sticks tend to differ in smell as far as I can tell. I bought these on two separate occassions, the first bag had a mild fishy smell which I didn't mind, while the second bag had a more pronounced fishy smell. Although, the smell became milder after about a week to the point that I could only smell it if I was directly holding it under my nose. Then again, my sense of smell is a bit nulled. My mom has a very sensitive nose and she can't really stand the bully sticks.<br /><br />I sure am gonna get more of these treats in the future. My dogs enjoy chewing on them and they also do a good job distracting my dogs as well.

review/text: Started giving those sticks to my English Bulldog puppy when he was 3 months old plus a lot of toys to rotate. So far (6 month old) he has not chewed up any boots or sneakers. When my puppy was 3-4 months old one stick lasted for about 3 days. Now it is less than 1 hour. However if the puppy has a choice he prefers boiled pork or beef sugar bones. Those sticks probably too small for large breeds, but my friend's Samoyed and Doberman liked them (lasted for about an hour).

review/summary: Worst Slim Jim's EVER!!!
review/text: I bought the 6-pack of these thinking "Hey, I bet these are way better than Slim Jim's, I LOVE THOSE THINGS, HOOOOO BOY YEAH!!!". I was wrong, firstly they are not individually wrapped. Secondly, when you try and bite into them they will loosen a tooth.<br /><br />Not to be deterred, I used my back teeth and kept chewing and chewing until viola', success!!! I maybe shouldn't have said all those bad things, they last through like 15 or so episodes of Breaking bad, and they taste pretty good. I can best describe the taste as salty sinew-laden beef jerky.<br /><br />So if you like beef jerky, and are patient, and enjoy chewing alot, I'd say go for it. Not a bad snack. Although, my dog kept looking at me all funny.

I was so exited to find these on Amazon. Even better, they taste much fresher than what we used to purchase at the store. These are the next best thing to being in Germany. By the way for those who think it can't be authentic to make these from a box, there are very few Germans left who would make these from scratch. My Oma (grandma) used to and it was an all day event. Highly recommend these.

He also loves Just Bananas (kind of sweet for me), but prefers the mango.<br /><br />I haven't tried the new packaging.  The one thing I didn't like about the old packaging was that if you didn't refrigerate or freeze the dried fruit it would soften and get stuck together.  I wonder how the new packaging is and if it will do the same.

They kind of taste like a yogurt-y raspberry, although a bit less pronounced of a flavor than either of those. They are partially dehydrated, meaning they have a little moisture, but are a touch chewy and a touch crisp all at once. All in all, not a bad product at all. I put them in with cereal, on top of waffles, and in my own trail mixes. They dont WOW me or anything, but they are pretty good.<br /><br />Enjoy!

Now I've decided to portion it out into smaller bags so that opening the main bag won't dry them out. Do wish they were less expensive as they seem to go pretty quick- at least the subscribe and save softens it a bit.

As another reviewer noted, they are both slightly crispy and chewy...different from other dried fruits that I'm familiar with...maybe closest to a fig, but more delicate in both flavor and texture. They have a subtle, sweet flavor that becomes more pronounced the longer you chew them. We eat them right out of the bag, but I think they'd be a great addition to cold cereal, granola or trail mixes, or homemade energy bars.

review/text: This coffee is called Maui. My favorite has always been Kona. I can't tell you what the difference is between Maui & Kona coffees. But both coffee beans are grown in Hawaii. This Maui tastes just like Kona but much less expensive. It's all I drink at home. When you drink coffee black, as I do, the true taste of coffee is not masked by cream &/or sugar. This coffee is mild & mellow but still has an incredibly full flavor. Everyone I've served it to loves it...even people who don't particularly like coffee. Bon Apetit!!
