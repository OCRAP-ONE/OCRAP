review/summary: No heartburn but not great taste
review/text: I got a sample French Roast and it was not heavenly as some French roasts can be but rather a middling flavor. I do have to say there was no issue with acidity even when I used the package<br />and used less water than I should have. Coffee taste is so personal and I'm sure you will get<br />mixed reviews on this. I remember the first time I made a pot of French Roast at one job someone<br />in accounting started to pour it down the drain saying it had "gone bad"!

review/summary: Not great
review/text: We are coffee lovers, and my husband is a heartburn sufferer hence my excitement to try the Puroast Low Acid Coffee.  It wasn't horrible, but wasn't as good as we would have wanted.  It just didn't have that good coffee taste that we love.  If you don't like strong tasting coffee, then this might be okay for you, but it isn't for us.

review/summary: This Coffee is NOT Bad!
review/text: I deal with GERD frequently, which limits my ability to have coffee.  When I saw this product being offered through the Amazon Vines Program, I was intrigued and thought I would give it a try.  The French Roast is not my first choice of coffee flavor and, at the same time, the taste isn't bad at all!<br /><br />I'm hoping that the Low Acid Coffees will be offered in different flavors so I could test them as well.  What I would like, even more, if there was an option to make individual cups similar to the Keurig system as I don't need to make a full pot just for myself.  (I don't own a Keurig system so I would have to improvise in making single servings.)

review/summary: Tastes Like Regular French Roast, but Easier on the Stomach
review/text: I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  It tastes like regular French Roast Coffee, but it's easier on your stomach.  Suffering from acid reflux disease myself, I can see that there would be extra benefit to drinking this brew.  I love my coffee and don't want to give it up.  If regular coffee upsets your stomach with reflux, you should give this product a whirl--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.

review/summary: It's a give and take
review/text: My husband gets heartburn frequently so I thought that we would. try this coffe for him.  The smell when you first opened it was not the wonderful smell of coffee that you normally get from opening coffee.  The smell of the brewed coffee was not very pleasant and since smell affects the taste the taste was not as good as regular coffee.  It did help my husband with the heartburn but you must give up smell and flavor for it.

review/summary: Wood to the last drop!
review/text: I am a coffee lover and mild heartburn sufferer so I was excited to try this coffee to see if it would make a difference .  I've never tried a low acid coffee. I just modify my diet to manage my heartburn and take the occasional antacid.  I made this coffee in the morning before work so I was sort of rushed and forgot to stop and smell it before I put it in the coffee maker.  But really, a good coffee with fill your nose with that delicious coffee aroma and one shouldn't have to make an effort to remember to smell it.  I'm glad I didn't though because as it was brewing my kitchen was filled with a combination of woodiness, smoke, and campfire....from coffee!<br /><br />Now I love my morning coffee so even the less than appetizing smell was not going to deter me (that and I had to get to work)!  As I usually do I poured a cup for myself and poured the rest into my huge thermos.  Drinking the coffee was slightly less unpleasent than the smell suggested it would be.  While sipping I was reminded of drinking a too heavily oaked Cabernet.  Yes, I enjoy red wine too, perhaps that's why I get heartburn? As this coffee cooled in my cup it actually tasted better...not good but better then the first couple of sips.  The manufactures claim this coffee is not bitter..I disagree.  In addition to wood, smoke, and campfire, bitter was the extra added layer of flavor.<br /><br />I tried this coffee black first, then with cream, and then later in the day I took the rest and mixed half coffee with half skim milk on ice.  The overwhelming woodiness was present each time.  I'm giving this coffee two stars instead of one because I did have three cups instead of throwing it out after the first sip...hey sometimes caffeine is caffeine...but I would never buy this.  I usually buy my coffee from Dean's Beans online but I also enjoy the lower end coffees like Yuban and Kirkland (Costco brand).  So I'm definitely not a coffee snob.  Good coffee is good coffee.  This was not!

review/summary: Excellent genuine 'old-world' first-cup-in-the-morning coffee.  Cost is the only drawback.
review/text: The flavor, smell, look, and no after taste of this coffee reminded me of the stuff I used to get at the "India Coffee House" in Bangalore, India, in the sixties.  The aroma and flavor is definitely "old world" in that it is genuine, high quality coffee and not one of those flavored disasters so common today.  It is not too strong and definitely does not have an after-taste that is the trademark of mixed bean coffees.<br /><br />This would make a great first-cup in the morning coffee. I tried it both ways - one cup with cream and one without and both were delicious.  I also tried it with a piece of Ghiradelli dark chocolate squares and the result was  'passed with Distinction'. The only factor going against this product is its cost.  At around $9.00 a pound it will probably be prohibitive for most household budgets.

review/text: I wanted to like this..maybe its because I can drink regular coffee<br />without the nasty side effects of acid problems, that this did not<br />taste so good to me.  I love dark roast coffees but this one really<br />was not what I had hoped for.  It was odd tasting to me, more bitter<br />than other dark french roasts are.  I usually drink my coffee black,<br />but even the addition of 1/2-n-1/2 didn't help save the rest of the<br />pot from being poured down the sink.  I gave it two stars as I also<br />know that taste is like art...subjective.

review/summary: Rich, dark flavor -- Less acidic aftertaste
review/text: This coffee certainly doesn't taste like it is missing something, it has a bold, dark flavor.<br /><br />It was actually a bit stronger than I prefer when it comes to my coffee, as I like a more mellow flavor.  I really liked the way this coffee didn't have a biting aftertaste.<br /><br />My husband prefers the stronger espresso or French type roasts, and he liked this very much.  Actually, he said he was impressed with how the low-acid nature did not sacrifice the flavor at all.  He is prone to stomach acid issues, and had none after drinking this.<br /><br />We have a small coffeepot that makes 4 cups.  We were able to make 2 pots of coffee with one 3 oz. packet, 8 cups total.

review/summary: We found no difference from the taste of store brand coffee
review/text: The manufacturer of this Dark French Roast Coffee advertises that it is gourmet coffee with less than half of the acid found in regular coffee. This minimizes, they say, heartburn, acid reflux, and mild stomach irritation. They add that their coffee lacks "the bitterness" found in regular coffee. My wife and I tried the coffee and found no difference in taste between it and the regular store brand coffees.

review/summary: Two mugs up!
review/text: I must say that I was sceptical about the possibility of a low acid coffee.  I love my coffee.  But after two or three cups, I start to get heartburn, so I've had to learn to limit myself to one cup, two at most.  Well, it's time to rethink my limitations.  The smell of the Puroast dark french roast was wonderful when I opened the package, but that doesn't always equal good flavor.  I used a regular drip coffee machine, and invited a fellow coffee lover with a serious acid reflux condition to share the pot.  We were both floored!  The flavor was excellent, deep, rich and, well, just like a good pot of regular old acidic coffee.  I take mine with cream and sweetener, my friend drinks his black and we both were extremely pleased.  Pleased enough that we split the whole pot between the two of us with no subsequent heartburn. I can say with certainty that without being told in advance you would never know it was low-acid.  Unless you struggle with heartburn, and then you'll know after the fact.  My friend was so impressed I had to give him the empty package so he could go online and order it for himself.  Two mugs up!

review/summary: A Mild Brew for Acid Sufferers
review/text: The hubby likes his coffee, colas and chili's. Unfortunately his stomach does not agree. So, in the past year he has made the switch from colas to tea and has cut back (or so he tells me) on the hot sauce. What he will not do is give up the black brew. When I saw this low acid coffee I thought we had found a solution.  Unfortunately I was wrong.<br /><br />On the upside, he liked the mild taste of the brew and even enjoyed the smooth after taste. On the downside, he didn't enjoy it enough to make the switch from his usual store brand which is considerably less expensive. Guess it proves that suffering has a price - about $4.00 a pound!<br /><br />Recommended for those who are willing to pay for a low acid mild brew.

review/summary: An acquired taste perhaps?
review/text: For those who love coffee but have bad heartburn issues, low acid coffee like the Puroast dark French roast may be a decent choice.  Pretty much anyone else can easily skip it, however, as the taste and smell are both frankly supbar.<br /><br />Clearly other reviewers have enjoyed this coffee, so individual taste reactions may vary, but I'm baffled at why this is advertised as being less bitter than standard coffee. It has a very strong and unpleasant chemical taste that is significantly more bitter than nearly any other coffee I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />This may not be an issue for everyone, but it's worth noting that the Puroast low acid variety doesn't create that wonderful brewed coffee aroma at all. You have to put your nose directly next to the cup to smell it at all, and then the result is an off-putting chemical scent to match the flavor. Having my kitchen fill up with that distinctive scent to let everyone know the coffee is ready is a major part of the coffee drinking experience, and this brand doesn't offer that.<br /><br />It seems like Puroast may be an acquired taste, but after four cups and trying the coffee both black and with different creamer options, I certainly didn't acquire it and can't recommend it to anyone who doesn't have a serious heartburn problem.

review/summary: Promising
review/text: It's hard to review for this 3-ounce bag of coffee for two reasons; 1) three ounces is not a lot of joe to go by, and 2) the tests were performed in a brand new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YPC2NM">EZ-Cup for Keurig Coffee Machines By Perfect Pod</a>, but let me share the experience with you.<br /><br />First of all, if you have problems with acidic coffee, the chances are good your problems are not as bad as my Dad's issues with it.  He was the test subject because he loves coffee, and can rarely drink it.  He's had 2/3rds of his stomach removed... TWICE.  He's also had Barrett's Esophagus, and has undergone procedures to literally burn the potentially cancerous stuff from his throat.  His sensitivities to acidic foods or beverages are, as you can imagine, severe.  So when I saw a product sample offered on Amazon recently, I jumped at the opportunity for him.<br /><br />He was able to make two cups of coffee using the new K-Cup Pod, but reviews are incomplete because the experimentation with the amount to put in the K-Cup is complete.  There were no instructions as to amount to use on the package of coffee, so we had to guess by dead reckoning (to be honest and fair, even if we'd used a regular brewer, we still weren't sure how much water to put with the three ounces... we imagined that it would have been six.  So we looked at a video on YouTube from Perfect Pod which showed how much they put in, and we followed suit.  What came out, was, according to my Dad, ironically "weak."  We probably should have put in more, but the portion we'd used was exactly half the bag, so we didn't have enough left to try it again.  On the positive side, he suffered no ill effects from what he ingested, so that's a promising prospect..<br /><br />My Dad and I have ordered a one-pound bag of Puroast coffee to try again, this time the House Blend.  I will make a point of returning once we've had the time to test it, and I will update as soon as possible!

review/summary: Excellent, truly is low acid!
review/text: I never buy pre-ground coffee, we grind our own; however, I was tempted by the "low acid" offer, since I often have heart burn when I drink coffee.  I was extremely surprised with how GOOD this coffee tasted. Seriously, I had very low expectations, and I was blown away not only by the fact that I had less heart burn, but the taste was great!  It not only didn't taste like "low acid" coffee, it didn't taste pre-ground.  That said, I was reviewing the prices for the low acid coffee, and it is waaay expensive.  Not sure I'll be buying it - probably just stick to my big mug of sweet tea.  If you can't leave coffee alone and you have heart burn, however, go ahead and try it.  Recommended for taste and low acid, not for cost.

review/text: The first thing I noticed, after brewing a pot of this coffee, was that it did not have the wonderful coffee smell that I love so much. When I first started drinking it, I didn't like the flavor, it is full bodies, but there was definitely something missing. By my second cup, it was starting to taste better, not bad actually. So I guess when you first start drinking this coffee you will notice it's not the same as the coffee you might be use to. But after you drink only this coffee, you get use to the flavor and it becomes a good alternative to regular coffee.

review/text: I have struggled with a love-hate relationship with coffee for years.  I love coffee, however, it hates me.  In recent years, I've learned that coffee will give me terrible stomach-aches accompanied by unpleasant headaches.  I've since learned to take coffee in very small doses and then only on rare occasions.  But because I truly love a coffee indulgence, I had sincerely hoped this low acid coffee would be the answer to my problems.<br /><br />Sadly though, I have to say, this coffee is BITTER!  - I for one, am a fan of a smooth roast.  Now if you're a Starbucks fan, you may disagree with me.  I, in particular, am not at all fond of Starbucks and their coffee, and the best I can say to describe this coffee, would be to compare it to Starbucks' most bitter blend... and then some.<br /><br />If you were to ask only my taste-buds, they'd say "no thank-you"  ...but as far as acidity is concerned, this coffee is spot-on.

review/summary: Low Acid True, but the format is for restaurants not homes
review/text: The coffee is rich dark and beautifully low acid, meaning not stomach ache.<br /><br />However, that format of 3 once bags that are not resealable can be a challenge to deal with.<br /><br />They remind of the bags I used at restaurants to make coffee for the diners. 3 oz is enough to make one 12 cup pot of week coffee or 8 cups of tasty brew.<br /><br />But I am just one guy and 8 cups a day is a bit much for me.<br /><br />So, I decided to use a french press and that was a mistake, the grind is too fine, and I got some sludge at the bottom of my cup.<br /><br />Then the following day, I made a small pot, but since the pack was not resealable, I thought it had lost some of the aroma.<br /><br />This could be solved with a ziploc baggie I guess.<br /><br />Regardless of the wonky format, the coffee is good and it is low acid.  But then so is coffee made with a cold toddy tool like: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H0JVW">Toddy T2N Cold Brew System</a>. The only draw back of the Toddy, is that coffee tastes like a different animal, but it is tasty, and low acid too (due to the cold brew process).  The Puroast Low Acid Coffee maintains that hot brewed coffee taste.

review/summary: Turns out acid makes for good coffee...
review/text: This coffee is not horrible by any means, but if you're a coffee drinker who really savors the flavor, you might want to look elsewhere. My husband has heartburn and loves coffee so we really thought we'd found something special when we discovered this low acid coffee but the taste just did not do it for us. Think of it like diet soda, not as good as the real thing, and over time you could probably develop a taste for it, but just lacking that something special.<br /><br />If you're not a picky coffee drinker, however, and just want something to wake you up without the acid, this might be a good alternative for you. I add a lot of flavored creamers to my coffee so it didn't seem as bad to me as it did to my husband, who drinks his coffee black. If you flavor your coffee a lot you probably won't mind the taste (or lack thereof) of this coffee as much.<br /><br />Just things to consider before you buy. It's a great idea since coffee can really aggravate heartburn, but just not as good as the real thing. I guess you have to decide which is more important to you: coffee taste even if it means constantly popping Tums OR sweet relief from heartburn while still getting your so-so morning java mojo?

However, I still had some heartburn with this coffee, despite the fact that I'm also on Nexium.<br /><br />Everyone is different when it comes to toleration of acid, so I wouldn't discourage anyone from trying this coffee.  But I did want to warn those who suffer from bad cases of GERD, that you may not be able to drink Puroast either.

review/text: Puroast Low Acid French Roast<br /><br />This is a dark roast coffee, and it was difficult to find out if it was decaffeinated or caffeinated, but it appears to be caffeinated. The packaging is not reseal-able to maintain freshness. The grind is a very fine powder, but works great with my French press. The taste and smell of the coffee was on-par with local brands and the name brands. I didn't find it to be particularly better than the coffee I normally drink, and the low acid part wasn't a big seller for me. I always take my coffee black without any cream, milk, or sugar, and even with double the normal dosage I use, the coffee didn't give me that jolt I wanted. The good news is that the after taste isn't as strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, great if you like coffee but cannot handle the acid, but I didn't find it to be a better coffee than less expensive store brand coffee.

review/summary: It was "okay" but not a 'gourmet' coffee
review/text: Coffee is one of my favorite things in life.  The decaf variety is usually as flavorful and fragrant as regular caffeinated coffee, so I pretty much expected a coffee with low acid to be at least comparable with decaffeinated.  Not exactly, but it might have been my fault.  After checking the package carefully I could find nothing that indicated how much water to use with the packet contents.  So, I made a regular 8 cup brew.  Upon opening the package I did not get the burst of wonderful coffee fragrance.  No coffee fragrance while brewing either.  It tasted like coffee but, for me, it was just so-so... nothing to get excited about.  There again, I'll take the blame -- I probably had too much water.  That's why I picked 3 stars or "middle of the road."  If I have an opportunity to try it again with the right amount of coffee grounds for the water, I will surely update this review.  I hope they will indicate on their future packages how much water is recommended.

review/summary: Probably need more than one morning to really tell
review/text: This wasn't perhaps the finest cuppa joe I've ever tasted, but there was certainly nothing wrong with it and it'd be perfectly fine as a day-to-day morning coffee. The low acidity that is Puroast's selling point isn't really noticeable in the taste, of course. Because I don't have a big problem with coffee-generated acidic reflux -- and have a generous store built up of my own natural bitterness besides -- it's hard to assess the effectiveness of that low acidity in making for a more pleasant environment in your digestive system. Maybe drinking this for several days in a row would produce a marked change even for the less afflicted? I hope it does work well for folks who need this benefit.

review/summary: Soothing to stomach. Unappealing taste.
review/text: Yesterday's mail brought from amazon.com's VINE program a free 3-ounce sample of PUROAST LOW ACID COFFEE, Dark French Roast.<br /><br />My wife and I tried it before, during and after breakfast this morning (2 mugs apiece so far).<br /><br />-- (1) How I prepared the coffee drink.<br /><br />My wife and I had had a late dinner yesterday evening at the monthly meeting of Asheville-Blue Ridge Torch Club in a first class local Hotel. In my case my main course was a stew based around a fatty cut of short ribs of beef. When I woke this morning, I fet mild stomach discomfort, and first reached for a GAVISCON-brand  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G7QR76">Gaviscon Extra Strength Chewable Antacid Tablets, Original Flavor, 100-Count Bottles (Pack of 2)</a> stomach soother. An hour our so later my wife and I began sampling the PUROAST Low Acid Coffee. I prepared the drink  in in our MR COFFEE-brand drip coffee maker. I decided to do it exactly as I normally do with FOLGER's or other brands, aiming at ten cups of coffee based on three scoops of the ground beans. Those three scoops used up about 3/5 of the contents of our free sample. I will try the rest tomorrow.<br /><br /> And here are the agreed opinions of us both:<br /><br />-- (2) PUROAST coffee felt very soothing in the stomach - immediately. Here was something better than any other coffee we had ever tried. Here, a couple of hours later, I am still grateful for a sense that PUROAST soothed my agitated innards. This is a quality to build the brand around, no doubt.<br /><br />-- (3) Neither wife nor I found the taste pleasant. It was far from vile. We didn't feel compelled to stop drinking. As I write, I am still sipping my second mug. I am no expert on evaluating coffees, but if I put my mind to it I could probably describe five different flavor sensations. My wife and I discussed our sensations.<br /><br />First, I asked her: "Does this remind you of POSTUM <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DGQK1Y">1904 Vintage Ad Postum Coffee Substitute Caffeine Free - Original Print Ad</a>? -- a drink I don't like. She: POSTUM tastes better. To me the underlying flavor reminds of POSTUM, a very STRONG POSTUM.<br /><br />Second, it tasted bitter in the mouth, though felt soothing in the stomach.<br /><br />Third, something reminds of wood shaving being turned into charcoal.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: My wife and I are both tempted to explore further the concept of "low acid coffee" and to order other varieties from the company's website:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />We are keeping an open mind. In my case I hope to find another blend that reminds me a bit more of coffee and a bit less of POSTUM.<br /><br />-OOO-

review/summary: Surpassed my expectations.
review/text: I normally stay away from anything labeled "dark roast", but I'm glad I took a chance on Puroast (low-acid) Coffee. The lower acid sure does cut down on the bitterness usually associated with dark roasts. My stomach handled this dark french roast better than my off brand medium roast. My only complaint, is the price of this coffee. It averages about one dollar per ounce, which I think is a bit extreme, I liked it, but it didn't blow me away. So if you don't mind the price tag, I would recommend it. Good stuff.

review/text: As an avid coffee drinker but not quite a connoisseur, I found the Dark French Roast to be delicious.  There appears to be nothing out of the ordinary in terms of its aroma and taste, possesses the somewhat typical characteristics of a dark roast with its smoky and slightly bitter flavor; add a little sweeter and the bitterness may subside.<br /><br />Having made a cup of Puroast, this may be a good alternative for coffee drinkers who may experience acid reflux or heartburn.  There appeared to be no difference in taste to other regular coffee brands that I have sampled, and I recommend this brand to those seeking relief or wanting to try something different.

review/summary: Mellow Rich French Roast +++
review/text: I just got a sample [3-ounce bag] of this "Dark French Roast" via mail -- and brewed it immediately via Gevalia drip machine to full European expresso concentration. It indeed has the rich deep dark chocolate aspect of a traditional Dark French Roast -- but not bitter [beyond the strong dark roast aspect] and indeed no notable acidic aspect. As for drinking modes -- I tried it hot and black by itself [not at all my usual way] -- hot with brown sugar and a little cream -- then cold with lots of cream and ice -- and finally with real French vanilla added to that, for a full French Latte. It was good all these ways -- rich and mellow. I do not have acid problems -- BUT am more of an English or Irish tea drinker -- SO a bit suspicious [and picky] as for coffee variants. This "Puroast Low Acid Coffee" variant is indeed way okay +++

review/summary: Can't Tell The Difference From Regular French Roast!
review/text: For folks thinking about trying this: please keep in mind that this blend is a FRENCH ROAST. As such, it will not taste like Folgers or Eight o'Clock, or whatever regular coffee you're used to drinking. French Roast really describes how the coffee beans are roasted: rather than being removed from the roaster as soon as the beans crack (which is what happens with lighter blends), they're left in until the crack a second time. The result is a very strong, very dark, very full-bodied coffee which is -- by nature -- lower in acid than other blends. That said, if you're used to the lighter blend, this WILL smell incredibly strong and even over-powering. I, however, love French Roast for my first cup of the day since it's basically like drinking an extra-large espresso.<br /><br />As for this particular product, I was somewhat annoyed by the 'low acid' claim since ALL French Roast coffee is lower in acid than lighter roasts. But, setting that aside, I found this to have a wonderful, deep flavor and more body than any grocery-store 'French roast'. (Yes, Folgers, I'm looking at you!) I'm no longer a regular French Roast drinker, but I'd be happy to brew this the next time the mood for a deep, strong, full-bodied coffee strikes.

review/summary: Good for low acidic coffee
review/text: A friend of mine who has acid reflux cannot drink coffee. So when this was offered, I decided to get it and have my friend try it. Well, low and behold, she liked it without any ramifications concerning her reflux. If she had any complaints, it would be that the French Roast flavor was a little on the strong side. I am sure that could be adjusted with coffee to water ratio, but that was one of her complaints. That aside, she was quite hyper afterwards, which she liked the energy it gave her (at first), but then started to have the shakes (but this is probably due to lack of caffeine for some time). I dont know if there is lots of caffeine packed into it or she just made an unreasonably strong cup of coffee. Her words were "it has very good flavor and a very robust coffee".  I don't think she is a convert to this particular flavor, but if she found "regular" coffee, she would get it, but found French Roast a little too strong for her liking.

review/summary: Surprisingly good for a none coffee drinker
review/text: I'm not much of a coffee drinker and prefer tea but thought I'd give this a go. I've never been a huge fan of the after taste I get with most coffee and that is where this one surprised me. It didn't have the same bitter after taste I was expecting. I tried it plain and found it bearable (keep in mind my lack of coffee taste) and then with some milk and sugar which I really enjoyed. To make sure I was enjoying the coffee I kept my sugar and milk in check so it was a cup of coffee with milk and sugar and not a cup of milk and sugar with some coffee added. That said the expense of the coffee may keep most none coffee connoisseur away but if you are in the none coffee club but are thinking of crossing over this is worth a try.

review/summary: Tastes Pretty Good!
review/text: Lately my husband and I have found our taste in coffee changing so that we tend to like darker, richer coffees. However, after using a very dark roast, strong coffee for a while (I don't want to give the brand because I'm not slamming it or anything) we both noticed we were getting more heartburn than usual. So when I saw this product available through the Amazon Vine program I decided to try it. This coffee is very finely ground and and very dark in color. I noticed it has a slightly different smell than other coffees, though I can't  describe it well. It's  a sweeter and less sharp odor than most coffees have. However, when we brewed it, we found it made a dark, smooth, very flavorful coffee. Both of us knew what it was, so I can't say for sure if we would have noticed anything different about it if we hadn't known ahead of time what we were drinking. We both liked it and thought it tasted as good if not better than other coffee brands we've tried (and we've tried most every popular brand: our favorites are Starbucks and Folgers). What I can't answer yet is the question of whether or not this coffee would be a better choice for those with recurring heartburn.Neither of us had any heartburn after drinking it, but we only got enough to make two small pots through the Vine program, and we haven't purchased any more.  If you find coffee is giving you heartburn but you don't want to give it up, I would definitely recommend you try this coffee as it tastes as good as other brands on the market that are not lower in acid.

So you can imagine my delight when I drank this.  It was just like Peet's but without the acidic after-taste or the accompanying stomach cramps.  I tried drinking it with our -dairy, organic creamer and with soy milk and, while what you add to it does change the texture of the coffee a bit (I prefer drinking it with creamer), it is consistently good.<br /><br />And, for those of you who like me almost rely on coffee to keep on top of things, let me assure you it really does keep you awake and alert.  And it definitely picks you up in the morning.  I recommend it.

review/summary: A little powdery, a little strong, but not bad
review/text: Yes - I suffer from heartburn.  Something about aging that I'm just not enjoying.  So when this came up to try, I thought it was a great idea!  As a caffeine addict from way back, I can't give up my morning cup of joe just because of a little stomach acid!<br /><br />I have to admit, I'm not a fan of French roast.  I refer to it as "French burnt" because it really tastes burnt to me.  So, though this still tasted burnt, it didn't taste different than any other French roast I've had.  So no marks off for that.<br /><br />It comes already ground, and wow, is it ground!  It's like powder, which I don't like.  I usually use K-cups, but when I get "real" coffee, I prefer it whole bean because it 1) lasts longer and 2) I can grind it the way I like, which is quite a bit more coarse than this is.  Puroast has taken care of the "lasts longer" issue because this comes in small bags.  I don't like the powdery grind though.  I use a French press, and the powder tends to get through the filter.  This should work well on a regular coffee maker with a paper filter, but this really isn't the best for a French press.  (Puroast does make whole bean as well - yay!)<br /><br />I didn't notice an increase in heartburn, which is really great.  Of course, I didn't notice much of a lessening either.  It's possible my morning coffee isn't my problem, so I'm not going to mark off stars for that either.  (The product description says it helps 90% of customers - I'm apparently special.)<br /><br />A coffee snob probably wouldn't go for this (Pre-ground???  Really???  Please!) but for the rest of us, it's not bad.  Again, I don't like French roast much, but if you do, then this should taste all right.  (My husband likes it.)  There's a strong flavor, but it's not bitter.  It comes in small packages, so even though ground, it shouldn't get stale.  It won't make your heartburn worse.  The price seems a little high ($24 for 30 oz or 10 packages), but you can save with Subscribe & Save, and if it helps with your heartburn, then it's worth the price.

review/summary: Great coffee solution for reduced-acid needs
review/text: Puroast has a great thing going for people who need reduced-acid foods. I've been ordering directly from Puroast for about a year, but I'm really glad to see their product is catching on and their distribution is getting more aggressive. I was even able to find it in my local supermarket a couple weeks ago when I suddenly ran out of my Puroast mocha java.<br /><br />My wife stopped drinking coffee a couple of years ago because the acid helped contribute to discomfort she had due to IC (interstitial cystitis). She began drinking only peppermint tea as a hot drink, and that, along with some other dietary changes, helped her a lot. I also had some problems with urinary tract discomfort as well as stomach acid discomfort, but I couldn't stop drinking hot coffee cold turkey (LOL) and read about Puroast. I tried it and it has become a staple in my daily diet: one large cup a day. Recently, my wife decided to try a cup every now and then, and so far she hasn't had any problems at all due to acid.<br /><br />The coffee tastes full-bodied even though Puroast does something proprietary to reduce the acid in the coffee. The French Roast has plenty of rich coffee taste. I happen to prefer more of a medium roast, but that's just me. All the Puroast coffee varieties that I've tried are plenty good enough for me--with the distinct benefit of low acid. You can get beans or two different grinds, and they sell the coffee in small packets as well as 1-lb, 2-lb and even up to 5-lb bags. They also have flavored coffees, like the mocha java I mentioned above.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great find and a great addition to Amazon's product lines for people who would like to enjoy the foods and drinks they like but need a reduced-acid alternative. Highly recommended!

review/summary: I'm not a fan of this coffee...
review/text: I like the idea of a low-acid, but not decaf coffee, because I love coffee, but have been absolutely flattened before by acid-induced stomach pain (and GAWD forbid I give up my cup of coffee in the morning!).  But I'm not a fan of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee, French Roast.  It leaves a funny taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify, and I tried this coffee black, with sugar, with sugar and skim milk.  That unidentifiable funny taste was still there.  As I've never tried a "low-acid" coffee before trying this product, I don't know whether to pin it on Puroast as a brand, as something they do with their beans, or if the strange taste is a trade-off in low-acid coffee.  In the days since trying this coffee, I've had other brands/kinds of coffee and have not had that weird taste, so I don't think it's me.  Your experience could be different, but I'm not a fan of this one.

review/summary: Pleasant tasting brew
review/text: I may not be the prime target market for this coffee as acidity has never been a problem for me. Still, I tried this out and was expecting the dead taste that you get with coffes that have had things like decaffeination done to them. But no! I screwed up my face and took a sip. Then I took another sip. Lo and behold we have a nice balanced tasting coffee roast. So, let's assume that the low acidity is something you need and that the product actually delivers on that, Then, in my opinion, it also delivers on taste.

review/summary: A smooth dark roast.
review/text: I was pleasantly surprised by the taste of this coffee as I wasn't sure what to expect with an "acid reduced" coffee. I generally like to drink a medium roast coffee as dark roast usually gives me an unpleasant after-taste and indigestion. However, with this coffee I didn't experience either. And as far as the taste it seemed like any other premium brand dark roast--this one with pleasing,subtle nutty overtones. Though I don't us sugar in my coffee I did find just a dash of it brought out even more depth of flavor in this coffee. So don't be wary of the "acid reduced" process--it doesn't seem to take anything away from the flavor of the coffee itself. It really is like having your cake and eating it too!

review/summary: Tastes great, no heartburn
review/text: I got this coffee for my husband who loves coffee but is unable to drink it everyday due to the heartburn it gives him.  I separated the packet into 2 half pots for 2 days.  He loved the taste of it, it was bold and flavorful and did what it claimed to do...not give him heartburn.  That is a win-win in our book.  We recommend this coffee if you are looking for a bold flavor and want to avoid the heartburn.

review/text: I tried this in place of my morning supermarket coffee, using the exact same preparation, with a stove-top percolator.  The smooth taste difference was noticiable right away.  I would even describe the taste as less acidic.  There was not even a hint of bitterness or after-bite as is common with cheaper coffee blends.<br /><br />The researchers deserve high marks on this one. Highly recommended.

review/text: If you're looking for a coffee that is kind to your stomach, you may wish to try this. I make decaf iced coffee each morning with almond milk, a tablespoon of cocoa and stevia for sweetener. This coffee is tasty, satisfying and smells good. I love hazelnut and french vanilla coffee so will be exploring any flavored coffees this company makes, along with this French Roast. I enjoyed it as a base for my daily iced coffee. What a great idea to design a low-acid coffee!

review/summary: Did not upset my stomach ...
review/text: I have gastritis ... and the very first thing the doctor said after my diagnosis was - NO COFFEE - and no caffeine. Both are contributors to the problem. As a result, I have moved away from drinking coffee, especially that which has caffeine.<br /><br />So, I was very hesitant to try this low-acid coffee, just because it has caffeine.<br /><br />It has a very roasted taste, a bit stronger than I am used to, but not bad. I would call it a medium to strong tasting coffee.<br /><br />All-around, very nice, and I did not suffer any consequences, although I did make sure I took my medication in advance of drinking it (no sense spending the morning sick).

review/summary: An enjoyable coffee with a big kick
review/text: All the samples I received for review were of the same flavor,Dark French Roast. It tastes like a slightly bitter espresso coffee. I filtered the coffee the first time I made it, but it is better suited to an espresso maker, whether a traditional Italian one that goes on the stovetop or an electric machine.<br /><br />The coffee has a rich, strong, slightly bitter taste - it is not mild like Sanka or a decaffeinated coffee.  I would not describe the taste a smooth, but it's not incredibly rough.<br /><br />It did not irritate my throat. I was unable to test the acidity myself and when I received my review packages the vendor's website showed links to Dr Taka Shibamoto's site at UC Davis, known for its food research, who had tested the coffee. On the Puroast website the link to the research paper is missing. This concerns me.  The vendor has their own documents, with detailed analyses, on its website - which needs updating so it looks less amateur. I am not a food scientist or chemist, so cannot comment on whether the coffee has unique characteristics.<br /><br />I did visit a gourmet coffee shop that sold a wide range of coffees from all over the world who said they had encountered some less irritating coffees with low acidity.  So when Puroast claims that its coffee is lower in diCQA acid than other coffees it is being compared with well-known brands like Starbucks and Hills.<br /><br />The individual foil packaging keeps the already ground coffee fresh, tasting like coffee ground freshly from beans.  It definitely had a kick and woke me up. I drank the coffee I'd made with a packet big enough for a 10-cup carafe at 2 pm and was awake until 5:00 am.<br /><br />If you have a sore throat from drinking coffee and like drinks made with espresso coffee then this is worth trying.

review/summary: Puroast low acid coffee
review/text: This packet made 3 pots. I'm not a big coffee drinker because of the bitter after taste and it upsets my stomach terribly. I still tried this. I was surprised, it had a very mild yet strong enough flavor and while I drank it, it did not taste bitter at all & not after either. I also did NOT get an upset stomach. I only added a little splenda to it, no cream or flavors. If I were to drink more coffee it would be this one. I had my neighbors husband drink some & he drinks a pot a day. He loved it. He drinks it black & even though the coffee he usually drinks gives him heartburn he said this did not & plans on buying it.

review/summary: I so wanted to love it... but I don't like the taste.
review/text: I was so excited to find this coffee. I do have acid reflux and I thought this would be great for people like myself. I regularly take Omeprazole. I was not expecting this coffee to do magic but at least not produce more acid. I don't really know if it works for people with acid reflux because I could not drink more than half a cup as it doesn't taste good at all. It's not like it is too strong to drink - in fact it's very light. But the taste is weird.<br /><br />Having said that, taste is a personal choice so some people may love it. Don't decide based on a review. If you're considering this, I strongly suggest trying it for yourself to see if you may like it.

review/summary: Thought it tasted okay, but couldn't say for sure it was low acid
review/text: I do love my morning coffee, but sometimes it gets back at me via my stomach, so I thought this would be a nice taste test to see if it was low acid-y feeling. I got one free sample in the mail, and when I made it, if I hadn't known it was the sample, I would have thought it tasted like my regular coffee, a Kirkland/Costco brand.  I do think I had to add a bit more sugar though.  Still, the familiar tummy ache followed and I was a little disappointed, but I know that doesn't mean it came from the coffee.  One sample is just not enough to tell if it has a low acid effect on the stomach.  I would drink it again if I saw it priced well in a store, but it's not something I will order just to have.

review/summary: Low acid coffee a hit
review/text: I love coffee, however, occasionally I have stomach problems from drinking too much of it. A low acid coffee seemed ideal, but would the taste be there? I am picky about my coffee and would drink none at all rather than old coffee or, even worse, instant. I tried the French style, which is not my first choice, but I found it quite acceptable. A  bonus is that the coffee does not take on the metallic taste that coffee often does when allowed to sit for a while. I recommend this product to anyone who sometimes passes up a third or fourth cup due to acid stomach or nausea. I am now looking to see if Puroast makes Columbian or other types of coffee in its low acid line.

review/summary: puroast low acid coffee
review/text: this was a nice flavor,as I do enjoy french roast coffee.  it seemed a bit bitter to me, though.  I am not sure if that is because I have been drinking coffee from a keurig single brew for a while, and a "pot" of coffee tastes different after sittting a while?<br /><br />I would have to say that the low acid was a plus.  I didn't get the upset stomach that I would have after 4 cups of other coffee.  My only request is make this in kcup form, please :)<br /><br />so, all in all, it does what it says it'll do, it's low acid, doesn't bother your stomach, and does have a nice flavor.  the foil packaging would be great at keeping out heat and light and keeping the flavor in.<br /><br />if you need a low acid coffee for whatever reason, this would be a good buy at the price.

review/summary: Coffee For All
review/text: There is no question that there are some people who can't have a heavy tasting coffee, largely from the caffeine or the roasting of the beans. Especially, those who have ailments like acid reflux disease, or antacid. Fortunately, there are coffees that are really good and safe to taste. For Puroast, they have made some specialty coffees for all that is safe and secure to drink, like their low acid French Roast. The taste is absolutely very strong, and holds up well with more popular brands like Maxwell House and Chock Full O' Nuts. I really liked the the taste of it, and if you are looking for a safe and secure coffee to drink, give Puroast Low Acid Coffee a try.<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Taste: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

review/summary: If you need low acid, you've found your answer.
review/text: If you're looking at this product, it's probably because you're like me and the acid in regular coffee is enough to cause fiery backwash within minutes or hours of drinking it. This coffee solved that problem for me, short & simple. I am reviewing this for Amazon vine and I'm not afraid to be honest.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is very much like a Starbucks decaffeinated Italian roast, but the smell is more like a Whole Foods Sumatran blend/roast. If there were any complaint, the lack of acidity does take away a little bit of the "hit in the mouth" that you normally expect from coffee.  That being said, it also worked well for making iced coffee.<br /><br />And-- no acid reflux! So in that, it is as advertised.

review/summary: Smooth and easy drinking coffee
review/text: Puroast is mean to be a low-acid alternative to regular coffees. The Low Acid French Roast packet made a nice strong pot of coffee. The flavor is above average for a ground coffee. Most noticeable is a smooth finish with minimal aftertaste. This would especially make a nice evening cup of coffee, or go well when served with or after meals that are more likely to bother your stomach. It is certainly a product I will consider using again. A good idea, and if you're one who is bothered by the acidity of coffee, this innovation will certainly be welcome. And though I don't have the means or motivation to test their low-acid claims, Forbes.com published an article backing up their claims both to low acid content and significantly reduced symptoms for those normally effected by coffee. So I'd say this is a product with good flavor that warrants checking out.

review/summary: Bitter aftertaste
review/text: It smelled good, I thought this could be good as I brewed my first pot of this Coffee. I wanted it to be good, but after the first few sips I got bitter after taste. The idea of it is good, French Roast is usually sweet and tasty. This has this bitter undertone, not sure if that has something to do with the removeal of acidic properties. Also it's pretty expensive for it not to taste like a fine brewed coffee. Overall I don't think I could pay for this, even though I like the idea of a less acidic Coffee. Maybe if they could lose the bitter taste, but after two pots of it that taste is prominent. So a no go for me.

review/summary: Not as flavorful as a French roast should be
review/text: While this coffee is lower acid than a normal French roast, the flavor isn't quite as deep and rich as you'd expect from a French roast. French roast is typically my favorite type of roast. The aroma is nice after brewing, but smelling this coffee right out of the pack it smells plastic-like. Also, I found that this coffee had a quite strong bitter taste.<br /><br />Though, I did notice that this coffee did seem to be easier on my stomach. I'm sure this might work well for someone who loves coffee, but, has a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />Overall, a basic French roast nothing too spectacular. Might be good for someone who wants a low acid coffee who is willing to sacrifice the typical French roast depth of flavor. Though in my opinion this coffee is way overpriced as the flavor is lacking and it still manages to be bitter.

review/summary: good flavor, easy on my stomach
review/text: I have suffered from acid reflux for about two years now and I am a daily coffee drinker.  This is not a good combination, especially on stressful days at work :)  I have tried decaf, and many different coffee brands to see which will have the least negative impact with varying results.  This is the first time trying "low-acid" coffee for me.<br /><br />I normally buy whole bean coffee and grind it myself, this coffee was already ground and was not nearly as fresh as I would like, but the initial aroma was still good. I prepared it with a french press at home using purified water at 190 degrees.  I let it steep for four minutes and then tested the aroma again.  It reminded me of the typical store brand type coffees, not bad, but not as layered as I am used to.<br /><br />I sampled it first as regular black coffee with nothing added.  It has the right flavor and character for a french roast, with a little bitter aftertaste that I felt was appropriate.  Then, I added half & half with the second cup which is how I usually drink it.  This being my preference, the flavor improved to just above average.  However, after two cups and an hour wait, I am not having any symptoms of heartburn or acid reflux that I would normally have which is a nice improvement.  In fact, I am surprised how little this has bothered me.<br /><br />In summary, while this coffee being already ground was not a fresh as I am used to, it is much easier on my stomach than any other brand I have tried so far and the flavor is good enough that I would try it again.  Could this be a daily coffee for me? Probably not, unless there is a way to take the acid out before it is ground.  I would love to try a version of that.

review/summary: Not my cup of coffee
review/text: I have tried other low acid coffees such as Ola's and really enjoyed the taste.  Not the case with Puroast.<br /><br />First, the smell upon opening the bag of Puroast dark French roast was underwhelming to say the least.  It was nothing that I could attach an adjective like "rich" or "inviting" to but rather made me think "what an odd aroma for coffee."  Not a good start.<br /><br />The quantity in the bag seemed small in the filter so I brewed with 10 cups of water and not 12.  I think it was a good choice because I could still see too much light through the brewed coffee for my taste.  And speaking of taste, I found this coffee to have an ash like character.  Not rich, smoky or full bodied like I anticipate a French roast to be.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and really lingers.  Overall, not a good coffee experience.<br /><br />Because taste is subjective, I will mention what coffee I find tasty so you can get an idea of what the other end of the spectrum from Puroast is for me.  Peet's Major Dickason's and Ola's Organic Uganda Bugisu are two of my favorites.

review/text: Being a French Roast lover, I decided I would give this one a shot. I did not receive the pack of 10 like the page suggests but I received just enough to make one pot- 2.25 ounces, I guess this would just be a taste test to let other potential buyers know if it's good or not.<br /><br />The taste i'd give 4 stars. I'm not sure if I would buy it because i'm hooked on one brand of French Roast in particular, but this wasn't a bad cup of coffee by any means. It had a smooth taste, was still somewhat strong despite being smooth but not too much so.<br /><br />It's a smooth full-bodied 100 percent gourmet coffee with half the acid. If you don't like a bitter roast but still want to experience a rich full bodied taste without heartburn, acid reflux or stomach irritation- then this is for you.<br /><br />My only complaint is I wish Amazon sent me more-  Recommended.

I sat down with my bagel and my coffee and had an enjoyable morning. My stomach didn't get upset and I didn't need an anacid. Yippee. The cost is high though but what I save on anacids makes it more affordable. For those of us with a touchy stomache, this is a great product.

review/summary: LOVE the low acid, quite strong, however
review/text: Overall, if you're looking for a low-acid, "he-man" coffee, then be SURE to grab this!  It's quite amazing the difference this low acid coffee can make to your stomach and I could even drink the entire pot of the stuff! Normally, I take coffee completely black, no additives whatsoever.  But, with this french roast, it's quite strong.  REALLY strong and definitely, less is better in the pot. If you're a fan of Starbuck's Verona coffee and have no trouble drinking that stuff black, this is your best bet for a low acid coffee.  Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.<br /><br />I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full-bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!<br /><br />This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low-acid coffee out there.  But, if you're like me and prefer a more smooth, well-rounded roast, then I suggest you try one of the other roasts.  Great product, highly recommend!

review/summary: Coffee for folks with heartburn
review/text: I was eager to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee, as I've had GERD for quite a long time.  I had to give up regular coffee about 10 years ago, much to my dismay.  The only type of coffee that I've been able to drink is Folger's "Simply Smooth" and it can be difficult to find in my area.  So, I was pleased to see another low acid brew on the market.  I brewed a pot, drank one cup and promptly poured the rest of it down the drain.  I gave this product 2 stars because it did not aggravate my stomach in any way, so it did live up to its claim, but, the taste of the coffee was awful.  Since taste is subjective, I hesistate to dissuade others from trying the Puroast, but I have to caution buyers about the taste.  In my former coffee drinking days, I was never picky about brands, and I find the taste of the Folgers low acid coffee to be almost as good as their regular brand, so again, I would caution coffee lovers that Puroast, while it's definitely easy on the tummy, is not as pleasing on the palate.

review/summary: Deep, darkly roated coffee with excellent taste
review/text: My husband has a hiatus hernia and must be very careful about drinking coffee and eating other acidic foods.  I was delighted to find out about this product.  We have a Keurig coffee-maker and the replaceable/reusable inserts.  I brewed us each a cup of this coffee and thoroughly enjoyed both the aroma and taste.  We both drink our coffee black, no sugar, so we really can appreciate the full flavor of the beverage.  Puroast is French Roast, which is a very dark deep roasted coffee bean, without bitterness or a funky aftertaste.

review/summary: Good but lacking
review/text: They sent me the French Roast which is not a favorite of mine at all. The coffee advertises as low acid, but after two cups, I was feeling the acid. I'm sure it is most likely because of the dark roast rather than any extra acid in the coffee. The flavor is good when fresh brewed, but it doesn't sit in the pot well. It would be best for company when the whole pot will be served rather than as a daily pot for one person. It is very strong, and reminds me of New Orleans coffee without chicory.

review/summary: Servicable Coffee
review/text: My impressions:  The coffee tastes fine but is unspectacular.  French Roast really burns a good deal of flavor out of the coffee bean and sort of homogenizes coffee flavors, so what you get is a dark roasted coffee (some might even say it tastes a little burned) that's deep and mellow.  If you're a fan of Latin American coffee flavors, this will NOT be the roast for you.  If you like Sumatra or are a general fan of French Roasts, you'll find this palatable.<br /><br />I made a point of drinking this coffee on an empty stomach to test the acidity and it did not give me any stomach upset after 2 cups.  You can interpret that any number of ways.  ;-)<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent one serving of this coffee by Amazon to test drive.  Because I was not able to brew more than one pot, I cannot adequeately comment on how this coffee might affect someone who suffers from acid reflux anecdotally.  I assume that the target audience (and only buyers of this product) would fall into that catagory, and sadly, I cannot advise you fairly on how this is going to affect you gastronomically.  Also consider that each case of GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) is widely variable based on the individual, therefore this product might be fantastic for some and still too acidic for others.<br /><br />So at this point you may be wondering, should I buy this?  Sure.  Start with as small a quantity as possible, test it for yourself, see how you like the flavor and whether or not the "low acid" aspect of this coffee meets your expectations.

review/summary: Dark Roast without Lots of Bitterness
review/text: I love dark roast coffee, but my husband hates the bitterness. Due to our differences in taste, I have two coffee makers in my kitchen, one for his light-medium roasts and one for my favorite espresso or French roast. Puroast Low Acid French Roast Coffee makes it easy for us to both to share a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Depending on how strong you like your coffee, the three ounce pack is very finely ground making it suitable for both drip coffee makers or French presses (Bodums). I own both and made the pot of coffee in our drip coffee maker. Because my husband dislikes strong coffee, I used half the pack and it was more than enough for the 12-cup pot. The strength was perfect in my opinion.<br /><br />The flavor of the dark roast comes through clear. I loved the smokiness left on my tongue after the cup, but there is no bitterness. It's smooth and satisfying. My husband, the dark roast skeptic, said there was no way he would like French roast. After one sip, he said it was very smooth and lacked the bitter aftertaste that he dislikes with dark roasts. Overall, I'd say that's a win!

review/summary: Good for a low acid coffee
review/text: Good product for a low acid coffee.  Puroast is a smooth, even bodied  French Roast with an excellent coffee aroma.  I drink a lot of coffee and have tried literally hundreds of different types of coffees and coffee brands, and Puroast definitely uses quality coffee beans.  You do lose some taste, bitterness and acidity (which I enjoy) with this low acid coffee, and if I had to compare Puroast to Starbucks, Dunkins' or most standard roast gourmet coffee brands, Puroast would fall short.  Also, the coffee beans were ground, so you won't get that super fresh small batch coffee taste you find in some gourmet coffees, but the beans were not stale tasting either (freshness was similar to drinking ground coffees found in supermarkets).  Definitely not an exceptional coffee, but a good tasting, quality option for coffee lovers looking for a low acid alternative.

I love drinking my coffee black, no cream, no sugar, and enjoy the actual taste of the beans. I was worried about the flavor since it's French Roast, I thought it might be strong and therefore still a little bitter...no worries, it's wonderful.

review/summary: I'd Rather Deal with the Acid
review/text: I love a good cup of coffee in the morning.  I also have an occasional upset stomach in the morning that does not go well with my aforementioned desire for a morning brew.  Thus I thought this might be a great match.  So I tried the Puroast Low Acid Coffee French Roast one morning (on a morning without any tummy issues so I wouldn't skew the result) and sat down for what I hoped would be a new coffee find.  It wasn't.<br /><br />Unlike most dark roasts that have a rich aroma and flavor, this had a flat bitter taste that was more like coffee that had been left in the pot too long.  It wasn't horrible ... I've actually had much worse ... but it wasn't very good and combined with the price point should give even those with terrible acid reflux second thoughts.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this product but, while not terrible, it is just a very mediocre cup of coffee.  Given the choice, I'll just deal with the acid until something more palatable comes along.

review/summary: Low acid coffee
review/text: I got a trial packet of this low acid coffee throught the Amazon vine review program.  The packet contains 2.25oz of this low acid ground coffee (not sure if the retial package is 2.25oz or 3oz each).  I brew my coffee using a simple french coffee press.  This coffee tastes fine with plenty of real coffee aroma, not like the de-caf varieties.  There is some bitter after-taste though.  For me, if I drink a cup (12oz) of regular coffee in the morning and a can of coke (12oz) during lunch, I usually will have some degree of heart burn in the evening.  With this low acid coffee in the morning and a can of coke during lunch the heart burn has not happened so far.

review/summary: If you can't drink regular coffee, this blend is inoffensive.
review/text: I should let you know what I usually drink for coffee. I like bold, dark roasted Indonesian coffees. I usually drink a particular blend from Starbucks, what they call Komodo Dragon.  I've found other coffees that I like, from various sources, but this particular coffee can be drunk black, unsweetened, and it is missing a layer of nasty bitterness that is pretty uniform in Central American washed coffees.  About the only new world coffees that are missing some of this nasty layer are Brazils - Santos has its own problems but the layer of bitterness that the Central American washed coffees have is at least partially gone.<br /><br />That coffee is a blend that has changed over time.  At its height, it was a five star coffee, now it varies between 4.5 and 4.75 stars, not reaching 5 stars anymore, but almost everything else is just so bad that I can't drink it.  I've had other Indonesian blends, they are missing the nasty bitterness that you find in so much of the standard coffee that many people just love, and which are highly rated.<br /><br />What Komodo Dragon does have, on its better days, is depth, complexity. There is a bold coffee flavor, of course, but there are other things going on. When I drink it, the second sip is different from the first one. The third sip is different from the second.<br /><br />So I was prepared to hate this coffee, and then after a couple of sips of this coffee, I was prepared to like it...and it just left me...wanting...something, some depth, some complexity.  The best coffees - again, my favorite Indonesians, have more than just coffee flavor. As you sip the coffee, there is coffee flavor, and then there is another layer of flavor, like when you drink a good single malt islay scotch, or a fine port that has cost you 50 bucks for a bottle and you don't regret it, even if you only can afford to buy a couple bottles a year...there is grape and then there is fruit, berries, flowers, fields of heather for Scotch, or groves of cork trees for Port.<br /><br />With coffee, there are faults, like if you can smell the shed, or the burlap sack that the coffee was moved in, and then there are positives, like when there is a layer of chocolate in the coffee and you have not put any chocolate in, or when there is a satiety factor - you drink a cup of black coffee and it is so flavorful, so complex that you start hungry and you end not hungry.<br /><br />Now this coffee is workmanlike - it has coffee in it, the blend has almost no bad flavors, no flaws. It is actually missing a lot of the bad flavors, bitterness, that I dislike in Central American washed coffee that everyone drinks in ground coffee these days. And if I went into a restaurant, I would be pleased to get a cup of coffee of this quality.<br /><br />But in terms of possibly replacing the coffee I drink everyday? No, not yet.  Do NOT get me wrong. I do get acid stomach, acid reflux some time. If my acid reflux was caused by coffee, and I could drink this without it kicking my acid into high gear, I would thank my lucky stars that I had stumbled into a coffee of this quality that I could drink.<br /><br />Many years ago, there was a commercial low acid coffee, it was sold under the Kava brand (It was not the mildly narcotic drink from Fiji. Not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892817267">Kava: The Pacific Elixir: The Definitive Guide to Its Ethnobotany, History, and Chemistry</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAVJ4W">Kava, Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce (12 Pack)</a>). I see that it is still available, at least as instant coffee. It is as bad as any instant coffee is, with no redeeming social value other than it is a low acid coffee, suitable for people who love coffee and can't drink it.<br /><br />This is a HUGE step up from that.<br /><br />So that is how this coffee gets four stars.  On the scale of acid neutralized coffees I know about, there is Kava, which might or might not be mostly Vietnamese Robusta, and then there is this stuff, which, if all you had tasted was American supermarket instant coffee, or stuff like Maxwell House<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a>, would be nectar of the gods.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, though. A five star coffee is going to have complexity, it is going to have depth, it is going to have a wonderous deep, level that is as much more than coffee as a fine single malt is more than Jack Daniels.<br /><br />If coffee were whiskey, this coffee is more than Jack Daniels, but it is sort of Canadian Club.  It stops short of the heights that it would take for me to rate it five stars - nothing bad, but nothing exceptionally good.

review/summary: Low Acid, Smooth Taste
review/text: I normally don't choose darker roasts of coffee because I don't like the acid and bitter flavor that is normally associated with them.  This coffee is quite different from a standard dark roast.  It has the smoother flavor of a lighter roast without the acid.<br /><br />I prepare my coffee in a french press with water at a temperature just below boiling, around 175 degrees fahrenheit.  When I poured in the water, I could smell a sort of a burnt aroma as well as a distinctly licorice aroma.  Undaunted, I finished my preparations and added some creamer and a touch of sweetener.  Upon tasting, I detected notes of chocolate and toasted nuts with a slight licorice finish.  Very smooth.  No bitterness or acid.  The burnt aroma didn't go into the flavor.  It just tasted toasty.<br /><br />It was a nice change-up from my usual coffee.  I usually choose light to medium roasts.  I would like to try some of their other offerings.

review/summary: Not bitter, but strangely acidic-tasting for low-acid coffee
review/text: The Puroast Low Acid Coffee was initially appealing to me because I suffer from acidic stomach, due in part to my love of coffee.  So, I was excited about the product.  Sure enough, true to advertising, it is not bitter.  So far, so good.  And, I'm going to take their word for it that the coffee is low in acid.  However, for a low-acid coffee, it has a strangely acidic-tasting quality about it.  Can't quite get a handle on it, some kind of funny after-taste that is not pleasant - maybe it's actually an alkaline aftertaste that I'm not used to in a coffee.  At any rate, this has an "off" taste to it, like some type of chemical residue has been left in the coffee.<br /><br />One star for taste, 4 stars for being non-bitter and (presumably) low in acid.  Strange product.

review/summary: Very strong coffee, burnt-tasting.
review/text: I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity--whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.<br /><br />I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for. I gave two stars because some people might actually really like that strong taste in their coffee. I don't think it's bad coffee, just really really strong. It makes me wonder what their normal roasts and blends might taste like.

review/summary: Makes a decent cup of coffee
review/text: I was interested in trying this coffee.  Although I don't have a problem with the acidity in most coffees, when we make a pot of coffee, we often tend to let it sit for several hours while we drink it over time, so we need a coffee whose flavor is able to be consistent for the duration.<br /><br />I was a bit wary of trying a French Roast--my husband and I tend to prefer our coffee on the mild side, and thus we usually drink Breakfast Blend varieties.  Upon opening the package, however, this coffee did not smell overly strong, nor was the flavor overwhelming.  In fact, perhaps due to the low acid, I found it to be a relatively mild-tasting coffee with just a hint of "roastiness" to it.  The flavor did remain fairly consistent over time.  I would not re-purchase this coffee myself, as there are definitely other brands that I prefer, but if you find the acid in coffee to be problematic, this may be worth a try.

What I like about good coffee flavor is that earthy, rich coffee taste that comes from quality coffee and just being fresh brewed.

I had to share with others at home and they all liked it as well.  I couldn't tell if anything tasted different since it is supposed to be low acid.  It tasted like regular coffee to me.

review/summary: too strong & tasted yukky to me, smelled bad too.
review/text: I don't know if its because I used too much of it, or its the coffee, or its just my taste, but this was way to strong for me. As far as the acid free part, that seemed to be true. It didn't flip out my stomach with too much acid like some coffee's do. I just didn't like the flavor of it. When I first opened the bag of coffee I didn't like the smell of it either. It just didn't have that nice coffee smell. Not sure what it smelled like, but it wasn't coffee and it was a really dark black fine grind that didn't look much like coffee either. I assumed that the package was supposed to be for a single pot of coffee and used the whole thing in my Bun Coffee brewer. It could have been too strong because my Bun Coffee brewer has a smaller pot than my old Mr Coffee does. But it doesn't seem to make that much difference with my usual Folgers coffee. While it was brewing it didn't smell much like coffee either. I tried a couple cups and it was so strong that after I dumped the grounds out of the basket I ran a couple cups of water through it to dilute the pot of coffee a little bit. Didn't help any, it still tasted way too strong for me. If I had some more of it I might try using half the prepackaged amount but I don't think it would change the taste of it all that much. Would I buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free? No. Wouldn't matter how cheap it was either. Would I recommend this coffee to somebody? Not if they were one of my friends! Who would like this coffee? Maybe somebody that's used to having the very strong espresso coffee or the super strong coffee I've heard they drink in the middle east. But I don't think anybody that I know would like this particular coffee.

review/summary: A nice, strong coffee without the stomach upset
review/text: This coffee has a nice flavor, is strong yet not overwhelming and doesn't give that stomach upset that pops up occasionally.  I have been using it in a french coffee press and have been very pleased with the outcome. Having spent some time in Germany I became obsessed with finding a substitute for German coffee that wouldn't be as expensive as buying the imported German blends.  This comes about as close as you can get to the flavor and aftertaste with the added benefit being low acid.  I think it would be even better in a regular coffee maker as opposed to brewing in a french press because it is a very finely ground coffee.

review/summary: Not my cup of coffee!
review/text: It might be a matter of taste, but this is the worst cup of coffee I ever attempted to try. My spouse and I tried three sips and dumped it.

review/summary: It does have the low acid going for it...
review/text: ...but that is about all.  It appears a lot of taste was sacrificed to achieve the low acid.  I think the reason it is French Roast was to try and add some flavor.  I would rather do without coffee than to drink this.  Not recommended.

review/summary: Coffee OK but price is excessive
review/text: Puroast low acid coffee does what it says it will do, allow folks with certain stomach sensitivities to enjoy coffee without hearburn.  The 3 oz packet produces a very strong pot of coffee, and therefore some folks may want to experiment with using a partial packet to brew the perfect pot.  But the coffee had a full-bodied flavor and did not leave any bitter aftertaste.  I would compare the taste to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0TW">Melitta European Roast Extra Dark Ground Coffee, 10.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />The problem is that while the coffee itself is good, it is rather overpriced.  As it stands, you are looking at spending over $2 a pot if you buy the ten-pack.  Particularly in light of the fact that some folks will waste a pack or two trying to adjust to suit their tastes.  I can buy four or five full size cans of the Melitta coffee for the price of this brand.  Because of the price, the coffee is not a good value for your buck.

review/summary: Ehh..
review/text: It may be low acid, but the trade-off isn't worth it. The odor & the flavor are both poor, and the coffee is relatively weak, which I guess I shouldn't complain about - if I'm going to drink a cup of foul-tasting liquid, I'd prefer it to be as weak as possible!

review/summary: Sure was hoping....
review/text: Low acid or not, I'm sorry, I just couldn't get past the taste. I tried it black and w/ additives - sugar, coffee-mate, etc..I had to draw the line at artificial sweeteners; they make everything taste worse... The brewing aroma was mild to nearly nothing --  depending on the strength it was brewed. Well, it looks like I'm stuck w/ decaf during the work week until someone finds a low acid, great tasting coffee...

review/summary: At last!!!
review/text: For someone like me who has GERD, this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZIER34">Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast, 3-Ounce Bags (Pack of 10)</a> has been a Godsend. I jokingly tell friends that coffee is my only vice. Unfortunately, if I drink more than just a few cups in a given day, the acid can become a bit of a problem. This Puroast low acid coffee is the answer to a prayer. It's a delicious, full-bodied french roast that should please even a highly discriminating coffee enthusiast. Perfect for any time of the day, or for a quiet cup in the evening, after your daily responsibilities have come near their end. An excellent choice, even if acidity is not a problem for you!

review/summary: The magic is in the grind
review/text: Tastes like coffee. A nice mild roast, which will not be to the tastes of those who want a bolder, maybe near burnt taste like Starbucks.<br /><br />And this is very easy on the stomach. Of course that is because of they way it is ground, this is a very fine grind and quite frankly any fine ground coffee (even Espresso) is going to be easier and way less acidic and easy on your digestive system then a rougher grind.

review/summary: Smooth, but with a bitter after-taste
review/text: Since I love French Roast, I was happy to get a sample of this particular roast. I opened the sealed bag and smelled the contents, which were not as robust-smelling as the French Roast I have been used to. I brewed a cup, and tasted it:<br /><br />1) Black no sugar -- rubbery after-taste<br />2) Black, with sugar -- mitigated the rubbery after-taste which was still there<br />3) Cream and sugar -- removed the rubbery after-taste, was pleasant and smooth but not as rich and aromatic as the French Roast I am used to.<br /><br />After four cups (not in the same day) my stomach WAS happier than when on "normal" coffee - I determined that the rubbery after-taste was there to stay. However, the coffee WAS smooth and definitely not acidic. But, it's a sad trade-off: low acid, rubbery taste (unless you mask it with cream/soy and sugar/honey). Hopefully something can be done to "tweak" those "settings".

review/summary: I am on the fence...
review/text: I was never much of a coffee drinker in college, and it was only when I moved out on my own, in graduate school, that I started to enjoy a good cup of coffee.  When I got my first real full time job, I would easily drink a pot of coffee every day.  However, as someone with a lot of gastrointestinal issues, coffee is a huge dietary sin.  The caffeine and acid could do me, and spur stomach aches that would last for days.  When I was officially diagnosed with acid reflux, my doctor told me to cut all caffeine out of my diet, cold turkey, until things were under control.<br /><br />Now that I have learned how to control my gastro issues, I am once again worshipping at the shrine of the coffee bean.  Since I began working again, I make a small pot daily.  But I quickly find myself feeling icky from drinking coffee.  So when I learned about Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I was thrilled.  It caters to people who have acid issues but love coffee.  I was thrilled to get to try it.<br /><br />My first impression was WOAH, this coffee is strong.  I am not a huge fan of french roast coffee, I tend to like a milder blend.  Once I got over the initial taste, and adjusted my milk and Splenda accordingly, I started to really enjoy this coffee.  While it was fresh and hot, it was pretty delicious.<br /><br />The problem with this coffee is when I returned to the pot for a second cup.  This was probably within 20-30 minutes of brewing, and the heating unit was still on.  But the coffee did not taste fresh at all; it almost tasted as if I had reheated coffee from yesterday.  It actually tasted more acidic that my normal coffee does.  So, I had to throw the rest of the pot out.  Because of this, I just cannot tell if this coffee really does allow someone with acid issues to enjoy a pot of coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps it was the french roast blend; another blend may have better results.  I would certainly try another flavor, because as I said, the initial cup was fantastic.  If this could be purchased as a resealable container, I may be more likely to purchase it, and make only a cup or two at a time, so as not to waste it.  I am not ready to give up on this product just yet.

review/summary: Low In Acid but Low in Flavor
review/text: I love Folgers "Smooth" coffee because of its low acidity and ease on the stomach, so I was anxious to try Puroast Low Acid Coffee for a different flavor and to mix it up a bit in the morning.  Sadly, I was not impressed.<br /><br />While the coffee does have a robust flavor that definitely taps the tongue right at the first sip, I can't say it's a really good strong coffee flavor that I'd enjoy sipping.  It actually tasted weak by the second sip and after a while it just tasted old and bitter.<br /><br />I tried fixing it up with things like sugar or Splenda but got the same outcome.  By the second cup, I tried a shot of Baileys and it still just had a bland flavor after the first sip.<br /><br />I'll stick to my Folgers "Smooth" blend for now.  It's cheaper, not bitter, and keeps a constant flavor throughout that is quite pleasing.

review/summary: Low marks for flavor and fragrance.
review/text: To be fair, I have to say that French Roast is not my favorite roast of coffee.  I never buy it in any brand.  If the sample sent to me had been a medium roast I could give it a better rating, probably.  Part of the joy of the experience of drinking coffee, for me, is the smell of a freshly opened bag or can.  The fragrance of this, freshly opened, was of burnt coffee beans.  The flavor, upon making it, was of coffee made with burnt coffee beans.  But, as I say, I have this problem with any French Roast.  As far as low acidity, I think the makers are on the mark.  I'd like to try this brand in a different roast to give it a fair evaluation.

review/summary: Too strong
review/text: I brewed a pot of this but found it too strong. Stronger than Starbucks even. Even with extra milk it still had that too strong taste. No acidic aftertaste, but I don't think many will enjoy its taste.
