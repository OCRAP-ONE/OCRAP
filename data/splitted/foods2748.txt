review/text: We love this drink.  My 4 year old had a 6 month battle with ear infections and this drink helped keep her tummy settled and regular while on all different kinds of antibiotics.  She loves it so much that a year later she still drinks it once a day.  She often prefers it to milk.  If you are looking for a tummy soother or a cow's milk alternative this is a great product!!!

review/summary: Great product!!
review/text: I bought this for my 10 month old son who has soy allergies. He loved the taste of this and drank 5 oz as quickly as he could!! It was amazing! It is not a replacement for milk, but it does have some vitamins and I am using it to help suppliment. I love that it is organic and natural. Flavor is mild but sweet-almost oatmeal-ish. I bought the Original. There is Vanilla and Chocolate, but I don't feel that my son needs the extra sugar or flavor; He liked it the way it was.

review/text: My one year old is allergic to milk and soy and has sever reactions to them. Most rice milk has carrageenan in it which gives him terrible gas. I use vanilla Brat as a milk replacement for him along with other vitamin supplements. I love that it is organic and sugar free with nothing artificial. LOVE THIS STUFF!

review/summary: Good idea but terrible taste
review/text: When my son was sick I spotted this product in stores. It sounded good so I bought two flavors. First my son saw the color and hesitated to drink it so I had to convince him to taste it. After he did he refused to drink anymore. I tasted it myself and understand why, it doesn't taste very good.<br /><br />I like the idea of this product but unfortunately we will be sticking to pedialyte and the BRATS diet.

review/text: These drinks are awesome!  I have never been able to get my kids to drink Pedialyte, and now rehydration doesn't have to be an issue anymore when they are sick.  Even better, the BRAT drinks help to settle their upset tummies and stop any vomitting/diarrhea.  I have even read that they are just as effective for other stomach issues (eg morning sickness and cancer treatment).  This really is the best thing since sliced bread!

review/summary: I Can't Believe it has No Sugar!
review/text: This is a great sugar free dessert!  I did not know there were so many flavors until I looked for it on Amazon.com.  Some of the grocery stores in my area sell chocolate and cheesecake in the pharmacy section.  This is much better than regular sugar free puddings.  Be sure to try out some of the recipes included on the boxes.  An early one (I have not seen on the boxes lately):  Cream 8 oz. of cream cheese.  Add 1/2 cup sour cream (or plain yogurt), 1/3 cup Splenda and 1 teaspoon of vanilla (other flavors such as almond, lemon or mint are good, too).  Mix Sans Sucre as directed and mix with cream cheese mixture.  If you want a thicker filling for a pie or preference, reduce milk in Sans Sucre to 1/4 cup.  With various flavors, you have many possibilities for great desserts!  Once you try it, you will see why I can't believe it has no sugar!

review/summary: NOT sugar free!
review/text: Product description says "Mousse Mixes that are smooth, rich, creamy and sugar-free!" There are actually 4g of sugar per serving. This package contains 2 envelopes and each envelope supposedly has 4 servings. So if you eat one package, that's 16g of sugar that you're consuming.<br /><br />Here are the nutrition facts from the box:<br />Total Fat 1.5g<br />Saturated Fat 1g<br />Trans Fat 0g -- but how does that add up to 1.5g of total fat??<br />If you read the ingredients, this contains hydrogenated palm kernel oil, which is basically trans fat...<br /><br />Total Carbohydrate 8g<br />Dietary Fiber 0g<br />Protein 3g<br /><br />Judging by the taste alone, this is awesome -- smooth, rich & creamy -- and I didn't even use a hand mixer to whip this up! It was a snap to make and enjoy after 2 hours of chilling. If I wasn't watching my sugar or carb intake, then I would gobble this up in a heartbeat. If you stick to the 1/2 cup serving recommendation, then you're consuming LOWER sugar/carb but 1/2 cup?? C'mon...

review/summary: Revised review after seller's actions
review/text: I received this item originally short in qty/weight by 13%. Although I emailed the seller (per Amazon's suggested procedure) they did not contact me after a week so I left a negative review. They did proceed to ship me greater than the short quantity at no-charge to correct the shortage and finally contacted me by both phone and email requesting I remove the original negative review. While I wish they would have contacted me in the first place, I have removed the original review and am replacing it with this one. Although I ended up with more than I ordered, I don't feel it is fair to give a 5 star rating (I feel this is a 3-1/2-star transaction). I firmly believe that had the seller weighed the original shipment accurately and replied to my email in the first place to sort out the shortage I would not have had to leave a negative review originally and would have saved us both a lot of hassle and time. They appear to sell good products, ship quickly and in their message they said they corrected the measurement inaccuracy of their equipment so I am hopeful this was a one-time event.

review/text: I wish I had something good to say about any of the ready rice flavors that i tried.  There is no other way to put it other than it's just plain awful.  The original is down right disgusting.  It was mushy and has a vanilla like odor and flavor.  Couldn't even save it by adding lots of butter to it.  My dog, who eats everything, wouldn't even eat it.  Just spend the 20 minutes cooking the regular Uncle Ben's rice.  It might take a bit more time, but it's so worth it.  It's amazing that this product actually made it to market.

review/text: Alright I am finally sitting down and doing this review. It's only been about a week since I received my Red Leaf Tea order, but I've had this tea three separate occasions since then. Every time I went to sit down and write a review - I was already finished my cup and I didn't quite know what to say.<br /><br />I think I understand what took me so long. This is a seriously mysterious matcha. When I opened the package and took a whiff, I associated the sweet vanilla smell with something else, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it. I whisked up a cup between 175-185 degrees - the matcha itself was bright, vegetal, creeeamy and full of vanilla deliciousness. Definite vanilla bean or real vanilla extract - a flavour that isn't sweet but is associated with baking. When I bake with my 3 tablespoons+ of real vanilla - it always smells sooo delicious and sweet, but if you were to taste it itself - it doesn't taste how it smells. That's the opposite of this matcha - it really does taste how it smells - I think that's where the mystery came from.<br /><br />Finally I associated the smell with the matcha whipped shortbread I made a while back. Of course! It smells and tastes like delicious flour, sugar, matcha and vanilla! Since I ate over a dozen of those cookies, it's now obvious where that taste association comes from haha. Love it.  I really want to do a comparison of this vs the new French Vanilla matcha. Subtle but delicious differences I'm sure!<br /><br />Oh man I just got an awesome idea. Mini matcha shortbreads for summer, using the different flavours of matcha! Ah! I can't wait to see how the flavour translates into a simple flour, butter, sugar cookie. Paired with an iced matcha. On the front porch. Okay I don't have a front porch : ( But I have the makings of the rest of it :D<br /><br />I don't know if I mentioned this in my other reviews - but this matcha (and the others) has an amazing echo of taste. The aftertaste of the natural flavours lingers long after I'm finished the cup. To be honest, it kind of makes me crave more. If I wasn't already bouncing off the walls with matcha energy, I might make more! No joke. This stuff packs a serious energy punch. I've been having it every morning! I feel lucky :)

review/summary: Great beginner matcha
review/text: I certainly would not classify this as a "blah" tea, but when I want something flavoured it isn't what I'll reach for - the vanilla flavour is there, but I had hoped for stronger. I made some before work today, and as it cooled (I find it gets better as it cools) I just kept thinking that it tasted like extra smooth regular matcha. Like a toned-down on the grassiness matcha, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I think this would be perfect for someone who has been newly introduced to matcha, or for someone who maybe had a bad first experience. If I had tried this as my first matcha, I think I would have thought "Ooh....matcha is awesome!". What I really thought was: "This is interesting....but I think I need to try more before I decide."<br /><br />The Madagascar Vanilla is definitely something that I can see being great in baking or smoothies, and I have read about a few people mixing it with other flavours such as mint (that may be something I need to try in the future!). I can also see it being a go-to tea to make when I'm not sure exactly what I want. I do wonder though how different the French Vanilla matcha is from the Madagascar Vanilla. I may have to place another order soon to compare...<br /><br />The best thing about this matcha is that it seems to be pretty versatile...I feel like I could probably use it to extend the life of some other kinds if I really wanted to. The taste is mellow and smooth, and there is no artificial taste to the vanilla flavoring. I recently noticed that on the Red Leaf Tea website they have an option for a "2 in 1 custom matcha", and I think this would be a really awesome option to use as one of the flavors. I'm not sure I will pick up more of this when it is gone, but that is more due to the fact that there are so many different kinds that I want to try. I could see me coming back to this sometime in the future.

The base in this matcha is far better than many other matcha I have around and then to consider all the flavors this company offers! Its astounding! This particular vanilla is not as strong as some - such as french vanilla but if you want your flavors to taste as natural as the flavor additives Red Leaf Tea uses then this is your vanilla!

review/summary: Tasty Healthy Yummy Treat!
review/text: For the past two days every time I walk past my tin of Red Leaf Tea's Madagascar Vanilla Matcha, I have to stop and smell it. It really is an indescribable wonderful smell!<br />I have had this Matcha in Red Leaf's "2 in 1" option combined with Caramel Matcha and it was heaven. This time around I bought each of those flavors separately so I could use them individually or combined. This past weekend, my awesome daughter bought me a Magic Bullet blender because I have been so into making tea based drinks and smoothies etc. Already I have used this amazing flavored Madagascar Vanilla Matcha to make some super scrumptious smoothies. This morning I added it to a peach greek yogurt smoothie and it was delicious. Vanilla goes so well with so many fruits such as strawberries, blueberries and raspberries. Or this Matcha is spectacular all by itself, hot or cold. This flavor Matcha remains my top favorite and I believe I will be reordering this probably every order I place with Red Leaf because you just can't go wrong with this one. (Perhaps I should give Red Leaf's French Vanilla Matcha a chance though!)<br />Besides tasting so yummy, one cup of Matcha tea is equivalent to ten cups of green tea, so the health rewards are astronomical!

review/summary: Vanilla is the one for me.
review/text: So now that I've caved into a growing adoration of matcha, I gave myself permission to cave to the siren's call of Red Leaf Teas. My wife already adores them for their Earls, and Tea Equals Bliss on Steepster has nothing but good things to say about their matchas, so it was an easy next step to take. And the Madagascar Vanilla Matcha was an absolute must for me.<br /><br />Anyway, on to the matcha. I'm in love, y'all. My wife asked how it was, and I could only put the mug down long enough to say "Oh my gawd...." Geez, I'm starting to sound like a Paula Dean special. There was no butter added to this tea, y'all, I promise. You all know how much I love vanilla, it's my chocolate, to be perfectly honest. Especially French Vanilla....mmm. Anyway, this has a creaminess that reminds me of a good French Vanilla, but without being overwhelmingly sweet like some French Vanilla teas can be. The greenness of the matcha isn't lost in the flavoring, it's a very nice balance. It doesn't taste artificial, it just tastes delicious and creamy and smooth and everything I ever wanted in a vanilla matcha. This is definitely one I plan to stock up on, once I've tried all of the ones I want to try! Next on my to buy list is cinnamon, and I'm already dreaming about mixing the cinnamon with the vanilla and drifting off into a delicious, delicious sunset! While full of excess energy, of course! Oooh, and mint for homemade, dairy-free Shamrock shakes! Mmmm....I see a lot of possibilities with this little beauty. Anywhere you need touch of creaminess, this matcha is there! Oh man, remember the blueberry pie I made with Vanilla Oolong? It would be out of this world with this matcha. And make it healthy! Well...healthy-ish.<br /><br />This matcha inspires me to bake and blend my own flavors and just go crazy with matcha. I used to only drink matcha occasionally, but I think this particular tea might lead me down the road of "My Morning Matcha". There are too many possiblities! Blueberries and Cream matcha, Shamrock Shakes, Dreamscicle matcha...do you see where I'm going with this? And the baking ideas are just as endless. Matcha butter cookies....oh hey, y'all! Lookie there, there is butter in this review. Dang.  I guess I am Paula Dean. I promise I will never deep fry matcha.

review/summary: Great! My favorite flavor!
review/text: These are my favorite type of Jelly Bellies. I had been eyeing this product for some time. After a few glasses of wine, I decided that this was a must buy because its price per pound was much lower than a single pound of this flavor. The price is still pretty high, but it is about the same price as buying 5 single pounds. I have been snacking on these for a few months. They are still around, and I still love them.<br /><br />The product arrived in a cardboard box with the jelly beans directly in the box. No plastic bag or anything, just the shipping box filled with jelly beans. I am not a huge germaphobe, but would have preferred a better container than the shipping box. This was the only reason why I docked it a star.

review/text: We've been using these as reward treats for training our 1.5yo Golden Retriever, and he absolutely loves them. They're small and hard enough that you can carry them in your pocket without worry of them crumbling apart, yet they're apparently tasty enough that our dog thinks they're worth the effort to perform on command.<br /><br />Though small, these treats are not for really young puppies, however: we gave one to my parents' 3-month-old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (a toy breed), and it was a bit too hard for his puppy teeth - he finally gummed the treat into submission, but he wasn't interested in a second one. So we'll stick to using them for training our older, larger-breed dog.

review/summary: I'm on the Fence
review/text: My dog likes the Milk Bone treats. We used to buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IGBG0Y">Milk-Bone 5 Flavor Small & Medium Dog Biscuits</a> for him all the time. We stopped when he started to have some mouth issues - not related to the treats. We tend to buy soft, chewy biscuits for him.<br /><br />Well, these little mini flavors are great. My older dog can chew them easily. They don't crumble and are low in calories. Nice. But for some reason, my little guy has been throwing up a lot since we bought these. He might have a bit of a bug or illness, but I find the timing odd. So I'm on the fence.<br /><br />I'll set these aside for a few weeks and then pull them out again and see if the tummy issues return.<br /><br />Review edit - It's been months since we stopped giving our dog these treats and.... he is no longer throwing up. Hmmmm. I plan to try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TLAWO6">Flint River Ranch Trout & Potato Wafer "Fish & Chips" Dog Treats - 10lb</a>. They are all natural and have never had a pet food recall on their products. Nice.

review/summary: My cat loves these...can't get enough.
review/text: I don't know if the previous individual had a bad bag, but I have bought these for a year now as they are the only treat my cat never tires of. He loves them and would eat bags of them all at once if he had access. They have always been perfectly soft for him, while remaining in solid chunks in the bag, waiting to be eaten.

review/summary: This is amazing product from Europe
review/text: Initially when i started feeding my baby he was a very good eater , I started with the home made foods like sweet potato , carrots , spinach +potato ..Initially he picked it fast and was eating well ..after two months he suddenly stopped eating everything... I tried Gerber , earths best and home made . I called up my sister , she is a doctor..she suggested me cerelac , and i tried amazon first !!I never guessed they are available in USA..Thanks to Amazon for selling this wonderful product ..This had a whole different taste , my baby ate only cerelac for two months when he started teething ...even during fever , cold ,teething discomforts he eats cerelac all the time , at times during teething he stopped breast feeding and i was very concerned and worried .. But I swear there is not even a single time when he rejected this product ..He did not like any of the wheat flavors from same company ..I am still trying once in a while though ..This flavor is amazing .i usually try everything before i feed  my baby ..This is awesome ..Worth trying it once ...<br />The only con is it comes in  a package of four if you want prime shipping ...Mothers usually look for one can to try initially..

review/summary: Great product...horrible delivery service
review/text: The product is great and the baby loves it.  Too bad it's not available locally to where I live because Amazon uses UPS as a delivery service.  They are the slowest, most ridiculous service imagineable. I could walk to the location and get it quicker.  Now we have to wait around on the weekend to get a delivery when the product was purchased a week ago and the post office would have had it to us in two days.  "What can brown do for me?" They can go out of business and leave the delivery to people who know how to do it promptly.

review/summary: SO awesome!
review/text: I've been eating these oatmeal pies now for 45 years.  Really, no kidding!  Mom used to put them in our lunch boxes and we just loved squeezing them a bit to mash them down before we opened these delectable treasures.  They really haven't changed THAT much over the years - they're just significantly smaller now than they used to be in the 1960s.  They were the favorites of the house then, and they are the favorites now.  I can't ever keep a box of these guys around very long - they just disappear without warning!  I particularly like the fact that they haven't made the filling taste waxy - like so many other favorites have over the years.  Great, great cookie pie, perfect for lunch boxes, highly, highly, highly recommend!

review/summary: Use with Cricut Cake
review/text: I bought these sheets to try out with my Cricut Cake machine. They work wonderfully. Use some Crisco to attach them to your cutting mat, and then place in your freezer for 10-15 minutes before cutting for the best results. Once you have them cut, it helps to attach them with piping gel or royal icing. After a bit, they will meld with your icing and look perfect.<br />These even taste great! They don't have the chemical taste the the Cricut sheets do.

review/summary: Terrible product!
review/text: Wilton Patterned Sugar Sheets Edible Decorating Paper -<br />Absolutely infuriated by this product. I was so excited to find the Damask pattern that exactly matched the decorations we chose for my daughter's Sweet 16 Masquerade Ball. Plus I knew I was going to have so much to do, that the sheets seemed the the perfect thing to make a beautiful cake with not much effort. I decided to simply wrap the outside of each tier and pipe a border, place a few fondant masques, and call it a day. Buying that many sheets was expensive, but I thought it would be worth it. The plan seemed to have worked perfectly UNTIL I opened the cake carriers at the banquet hall the next day to do the final stack and pipe the bottom borders. The sheets had evidently absorbed moisture from the buttercream and were all bubbled up and buckled over the entire cake. Any attempt to press them back into place resulted in the sheets sticking to my fingers and shredding away from the cake. Thankfully, the hall was dim and I had made extra fondant masques, so I was able to cover most of the damage. BUT, this was supposed to be the centerpiece of the banquet table! It ended up being relegated to a corner table, so that the worst damage was blocked from view by the wall. I don't make my living making cakes, but I have been doing it for over 30 years, so to have to present such disappointment at my own daughter's Sweet 16 party made me sick! Shame on you Wilton for producing such a shabby product!

review/summary: Wilton Sugar Sheets
review/text: I purchased the Zebra, alphabet and Pink sheets for my daughters birthday cake.  These were SO EASY to use.  The only thing I would hesitate on again is the alphabet.  The tend to tare as you lift them from the backing.  The icing doesn't have to be "decorator smooth" for it to lay right.  I do recommend using the piping gel to help attach.  Water tends to bleed the design.  The sheet starts out like gum as the the other reviewer mentioned, but quickly "morphs" with the icing.  Within a few hours of applying the sheet, it didn't have the chewy texture.

review/summary: Easy to use, Falls apart easily
review/text: The sheet itself came as advertised in regards to the color and overall product.  It cuts easily, and you can draw on it as well if you need to make a pattern to cut out.  I tried to use a cookie cutter on it, but that just left a small indentation on the fondant.  This was no big deal as I just used scissors to cut on the indentations.<br /><br />What I found difficult was removing the plastic backing.  In multiple instances, it fell apart as I tried to remove it from the backing to apply it to the cake.  In the end, because we were not going to be eating that part, I left the plastic backing on, and it looked very nice.<br /><br />Overall, it was nice to use in such a way that you could just cut out any shape you want.  If you don't intend to do anything other than place it as decoration on the cake, I think this is a great, easy product.  My sister used it in that capacity, and her cake came out great.  So in essence, I think it's really what you want to use it for.<br /><br />I have not used a sheet to cover the cake, just for decorations.  For decorations, this is much easier than rolling your own fondant.  Also, I only used part of the sheet, and put the rest in storage as it recommends.  I'll try it again in a few weeks and see if it actually kept and update the review with the results.<br /><br />A tip -<br />If you do any painting on the fondant, make sure you do it after the fondant is on the cake itself, as the liquid from the edible paint makes the fondant disintegrate in a way where it cannot be removed from the backing.

If someone doesn't like fondant, this could be an alternative to decorate with as it gives a smooth finish that looks great (but obviously it's not as versatile as fondant).

review/summary: Tricky to work with
review/text: This product is very tricky to work with and a pain in the rear.  If you can get it cut and on the cake without tearing, it looks great, but it's very delicate work.  Buy 2 the first time you use it, because you will probably need a backup.  I cut out a VERY simple silhouette of a black cat to go on top of an orange Halloween cake and even that simple shape had to be trimmed and finessed because the edges would tear as I was cutting (I used small sharp cuticle scissors).  If you have a Cricut and lots of shapes to cut with, it's probably a lot easier, but I don't anticipate using these enough to justify the expense.  Cool concept- but I think it would work much better if the sheets were a little thicker and sturdier.<br /><br />ALSO- the black will stain your fingers and your tongue (!) when you eat it.  Kids thought it was great, hubby and me not so much.<br /><br />By the way, I DON'T recommend the pre-cut letter sheets.  The letters are small and not very well cut.  I couldn't get them off the backing without tearing them- I ended up having to pipe the letters on anyway, which I could have done in the first place much more quickly and easily.  Not worth the $4-$5.

review/summary: Awful product, so disappointed
review/text: I bought the black and white zebra pattern to make a purse cake for my daughter's birthday.  It was easy to cut, I'll give it that, but the tiniest amount of dampness (not even real water) was enough to make the colors bleed.  So that was one sheet straight into the trash, which at $4 a go doesn't sit well.  I got the second and third sheets on the cake OK but the edges wouldn't stick down and now, several hours later, the sheets have sagged and and have big cracks everywhere.  The cake looks awful, it the birthday party tomorrow and I really don't know how to fix it.  At this moment my husband is trying to "paint" it back together.  Lucky for me he's a very patient man!  So, so disappointed with this product.  It's such a great idea but doesn't seem to work in practice.  I won't be buying this again.

review/summary: nice idea
review/text: I had hoped for better results with this, and the fault may be my inexperience, but it did not give me exactly what i wanted.<br /><br />1)After i drew the lines at the back of the peel-away plastic and cut into the squares that i wanted, the first 3 peeled away fine and attached to the waiting cupcakes. The rest however, were a nightmare. The sugar sheet pieces had begun to harden on the plastic-backing and began to chip when i tried to peel them off. I managed, but only because the pattern was the abstract damask did i get away with the imperfections from untidy peeling, as well as the fact that my shapes were no more intricate than simple squares.<br /><br />2)The taste was not all that great either - it didn't taste bad, but it added nothing to the taste of the cupcakes.<br /><br />Because i wanted the damask pattern to match my theme, i was sufficiently satisfied. That said, i would not use any of the plain ones in future cake decorating projects.

review/summary: Very easy to work with, be quick
review/text: I used the Wilton Sugar Sheet with my [[ASIN:B004XJ9924 Cricut Mini Cake, Red]. Because I was using the smaller Cricut machine I had to cut the sheet for it to fit on the mat. I left the backing plastic on and attached the plastic with shortening to the mat. I might tape it down next time because there was some sliding resulting in a few cuts where I had to hold the ends in place. Because I did have the backing in place it was easy to return the leftovers to the bag while I programmed new cuts. I decorated about 4 dozen cookies with small flowers cut from the sheet. I would definitely use this again. I took scissors to make petals out of the scraps. While I did have some trouble with crumbling or snagging as the sheets sat exposed to air, 90% of my cuts came out. The sugar transferred nicely to the cookie and tasted fine. I would not try to get very intricate cuts with this, the sugar won't hold. For bold shapes, it's a fast way to decorate. I think I might try just cutting one up with some decorative tip scissors for an interesting cake border.

I thought, it will just be a couple of bad ones, but No...ALL the bars was so dry, gritty and hardly no Fig fruit on it....I ended up throwing it each time I open one.

The crackers contain a relatively low amount of sodium which is more good news.<br /><br />These crackers are particularly good to serve with a dip to guests. Of course, you can also treat yourself to this same delight! They taste wonderful with a garlic and herb cheese dip I sometimes use. If you want the same crackers that are a little bigger and easier for people to hold onto while they put some dip on the cracker, try the "big" version of Wheat Thins.<br /><br />One small caveat: Eat these before any expiration date printed or stamped on the top of the box. You wouldn't want to eat stale crackers, now would you?<br /><br />Overall, Wheat Thins crackers are some of the best crackers on your grocer's shelf. Buy a box and enjoy some today!

review/summary: Tasty if not very spicy
review/text: I was hoping these noodles would have a little more kick than they did, but aside from being not as hot as I'd like, they're pretty tasty. I ended up adding some crushed red pepper flakes and that helped a bunch. Adding some scallions, mushrooms, and shrimp or chicken turns them into a nice meal. The noodles cook well but are only average in the flavor department. They won't make you feel like you got carry-out from your favorite Chinese place, but they're not awful either.<br /><br />Not the best Chow Mein you can get, but easy to make, and even easier to add your own fresh ingredients to, so all-in-all not a bad quick meal.

review/text: This is very easy to prepare. I added a lot of vegetables to it though or it would have been a little too salty for me! If you usually add salt or soy sauce to your cooking you will have no problem with it, but if you don't use much salt you will need to add some vegs or meat or fish or tofu to it. The flavor itself was great.

review/text: Having lived in the Middle East for 10 years, our family loves hummos and we make a lot of it.  This is the best brand I've ever found in the U.S.  I like the taste and the texture of this one, and it mixes wonderfully with the other ingredients.  I found it somewhere locally, then when I went to buy more I couldn't find it again.  Krinos is so much better than all the brands you find in health food stores or supermarkets, and the price happens to be about half of what most stores charge for a similar amount of tahini.  I was delighted to find it on Amazon!

review/text: I don't know what has happened to formulation or processing of the "big name" Earl Grey teas in the past several years, but the quality of those had degraded to such an extent that I went looking for a replacement. I am happy to say that I have found it in spades in this brand!  The bergamot comes through not only in the aroma but also the taste. (I also really like the color of the box!) This company also makes a "double bergamot" Earl Grey but I actually prefer the regular (this one) to the double. If you have become unhappy with your current Earl Grey, I recommend that you give this one a try.

review/summary: Perhaps Brewing Wrong?
review/text: I find that most (not all) people in North America brew their tea for too long a period.  When I first visited China I was amazed at how quickly after pouring the boiling water into the pot, they poured out the "finished" tea.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Keurig machine and have it perfect for making this tea.  I only drink it iced, perhaps that is the difference?  Two bags in the permanent filters and run through twice (using the large cup setting).  Poured over ice with a bit of milk.  I use Stevia for my sweetener.<br /><br />No bitterness.  Just perfectly brewed aromatic Chai Tea.  With the double spice, it gives my tastebuds the perfect "kick" that I desire.

review/summary: This chai tastes very good but should include more black tea leaves.
review/text: This chai has good flavor but needs more black tea leaves to make a fully satisfying cup of tea. It leans on cloves but not overly, to my taste. The Tazo chai has more tea leaves and tastes very good if used properly -- 2 mugs of tea or an extra large mug from each tea bag. I've gotten used to the Stash spicing now (have enjoyed 6 boxes) and like to drink both the Stash and the Tazo (also finished 6 boxes), which I drink straight, in succession, in the morning. Then I switch to decaf Tazo chai which is very good and makes 2 mugs per tea bag.

review/summary: Stash tea can vary batch to batch
review/text: I have, in the past, positively reviewed other Stash flavors, Ginger Lemon and Holiday Chai.  Had a problem with the Double Bergamot tea once, but then a second shipment was excellent.  But this Double Chai Spice has a strange chemical flavor. Tried mixing it with regular black tea because the chai seems to be lacking a tea flavor.  I have tried other brands of chai and have made my own.  There's something off about this - it's got a strongly astringent, bitter flavor.  I wonder if it's because the spices are ground to a powder?  The best chai is made with whole spices.

review/summary: Best of the Earl Grey teas
review/text: A classic tea, great by itself or with a large chocolate brownie drenched in dark chocolate syrup. Earl Grey seems to be a difficult tea to blend properly: without the proper proportion and quality of bergamot, the tea is either astringent or overly flowery. In my opinion, Stash gets the blend just right with their standard Earl Grey (the decaf version is also terrific, but to my taste the double bergamot drowns the tea flavor). I've tried several other brands, and can hardly drink the others. Don't say you dislike Earl Grey before trying this blend!

review/summary: stash peach
review/text: I fell in love with Stash Peach Tea in about 2005 when I had it at the Hobnob Tea Room in Loveland CO. Not only can you select it for your lunch but you can buy a box from the stock they keep on hand. Because it's a family owned restaurant (not a chain) naturally they have to charge enough to pay for s/h. I found it a little cheaper at Vitamin Cottage. I always had a big cup after lunch at my desk at the post office where I worked in the passport office. Every time customers or other clerks would come in they would say "wow what smells so delicious?". It began to happen that I would make a trip to Hobnob or Vit Cott and they would be out of my tea. That flavor does not seem to be carried even in stores that carry Stash. So I found it by accident on Amazon while looking for something else entirely. I was so happy. If I purchase enough at a time it saves me nearly a dollar a box over all. I drink it every day so VOILA I found a great deal on Amazon. Thank you!!!

review/summary: Earl Grey of Earl Grey +++
review/text: I already liked regular Stash Earl Grey and so dared to try this doubled bergamot variant. This Earl Grey variant is the best I have tried out of many. There may be ones stronger in both aspects of the black tea and bergamot or more balanced -- but I only know that this "Double Bergamot Earl Grey" is a very balanced rich black tea with bergamot -- and it is organic like other Stash teas. This doubled bergamot Earl Grey is great hot with milk and brown sugar -- or icy with just a tad lemon or lime to add to the bergamot -- or without such additions. Also it is so rich someone can add it to other plain, even modest, black tea [bags one-for-one] for a more mellow bergamot tea. I even found it interesting with black mint tea [bags one-for-one] as this variant is not overwhelmed by other teas +++

review/text: I was introduced to Stash a few years ago when I sampled their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQG89Y">peppermint tea</a>, which was so powerful you could smell it through the packaging. It was so delicious I decided to get a box of each of their tea samplers, including black.<br /><br />Now I have another Stash favorite. After running out while on vacation I had to try a number of different Earl Grey teas (Bigelow, Twinings, Generic Grocery Store brand), and though adequate, they lacked the extra bergamot kick I'd grown to love. With Stash you get a fragrant, excellent quality tea, and they know how to package it for freshness.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite morning hot drinks when I want to start my day with a nice jolt. And if you have a sweet tooth like me, serve hot with sweetened condensed milk.

I've cut back in that I don't brew two bags in a mug for 20 minutes at a time like I did a decade ago with Earl Grey.<br /><br />Super Target used to carry it around here, D/FW, but I think I may have singlehandedly cleaned them out over the course of the past year.<br /><br />The great thing about Amazon is, not only can I buy six+ months worth at once but there is no tax & free shipping.  Between those extras and not having to go anywhere to purchase it, it costs well below what it does at the store.

review/summary: the best Earl Grey evah!
review/text: My husband will drink nothing but double bergamot earl grey from Stash, I used to by it straight from Stash but this is much faster and still a good price! I will probably set up a autoship order as soon as I figure out how fast we go through 6 boxes.  If you like Earl Grey, you really need to try this tea! They also have a green tea version

review/summary: Tasty Tea
review/text: I used to spend a fortune on good Chai Tea at the coffee shop.  Then, I discovered the double-spice tea.  We both loved the stronger flavor of the spices.  To my dismay, on my next trip to the grocery store, the double-spice tea was nowhere to be found!  It was one of those items that apparently wasn't on their regular ordering schedule.  I looked it up on Amazon, and, there it was...six boxes at a time, on subscribe and save, a decent price, and quick delivery!  This tea is great with a "sweetener of choice" (I generally use stevia or agave in mine) and some milk or cream, hot or cold.  My hubbie drinks it with no additions at all and it is his "pre-sleep" tea of choice.  I've also used 5-7 bags in my iced tea maker and the result is yummy iced tea (or, add just a bag of this tea to regular tea for a hint of spice).  Stash teas are great overall.  I like the fact that they are individually wrapped in a "foil" wrap that holds together well and can be taken to the office or wherever without dissolving in one's pocket or purse!  It IS black tea and contains caffeine!  If this is a problem, try the Good Earth Original Caffeine-Free tea.  Also available on Amazaon, it is a delicious, slightly sweet, cinnamon-y tea!

review/summary: Stash teas.
review/text: Stash teas offer rich full flavors from light refreshing teas to the full body spicy aroma or the rich chai teas also comes in Decaf.  The longer you brew the stronger, serve with french vanilla creamer.  Enjoy.<br /><br />**FYI**<br />Amazon offers these by the case of 6 boxes only. Not the individual box of 18cnt tea bags.  Yep, thats 108 tea bags, to share with the office & family.

review/summary: Great Tea!
review/text: This tea is absolutely wonderful.  I usually stick to plain black tea, but this double spice is really good.  Awesome with cookies or cake that have cinnamon, clove or chocolate in them.  Try putting a splash of vanilla soy milk in it...excellent!

review/summary: One of my favorites!
review/text: I have been a tea drinker all my life, and Stash has some wonderful flavors! I think I got primarily hooked on the finer teas when my parents drove us to Canada as children every year.  I primarily drink Earl Gray teas because they are a deep rich teas, but not overpowering.  When you drink Earl Gray, you feel like you drank a fine cup of English tea.  The Double Bergamot added to the Earl Gray is even more superior!  Bergamot is also relaxing.  This is a wonderful blend and very difficult to find in stores.

review/summary: Gets me out of bed in the morning!
review/text: What can get me out of a cat-warmed bed on a chilly morning?  A pot of Stash Double Spice Chai tea.  The spices are enticing and warm up you up down to your toes.  I find the best way to drink it is with a splash of vanilla soy milk in the bottom of the mug, then pour in the tea.  The vanilla soy adds just enough sweetness to counteract the bitterness of the tea (I like to brew it strong), but not so sweet that it overpowers the spices.  Yum!

review/summary: Ahhh finally truly spicy chai in a tea bag
review/text: I once had a soy chai latte that blew my mind. I was driving through Missoula Montana. I have yearned for years to capture that taste again. I have tried chai after chai with no luck. This chai comes close. If you like spicey chai but without all the sugar and milk in the premixed, this may be your chai.
