review/summary: Fits great Look Fabulous!
review/text: I was a bit skeptical, because most "sexy" costumes tend to fit a bit snug. But I'm a size 14 and the  large costume fit me perfectly! It is flattering and super fun with the buttons and ruffles. There were a few strings hanging off and the costume is a little shear in some places, but it's pretty good quality for a bag costume. The wig looked like a hot mess at first, but after fussing with it for a bit, I put it in tiny pigtails and added a fun bow and it looked super cute. I am 100% pleased with this costume and can't wait to wear it to my Halloween party this weekend!

review/summary: Not your mother's Cream of Wheat
review/text: I am a culinary student thus I appreciate quality in foods. I was introduced to this variety of Cream of Wheat at the "Original Pancacke House" near me. One that I frequent gave me a box of the 10 minute variety to try at home. There is a big difference between this one and the "instant" varieties. Unfortuantely, I have never found a grocery store that carries the yellow box. However, Amazon is easy, cheap and free shipping. Be careful to stay close when cooking. It must be stirred during the entire cooking process to avoid lumps. After much experimentation, I use 1% milk and mix one cup of milk to one ounce of cereal. Heat on medium. Too hot cooks it too fast and creates lumps. It easy to make ahead. I prepare 10 oz servings on Sunday for use during the week. I serve with fresh fruit. For added richness, add one cup of heavy cream to seven cups of milk (ratio). When you reheat add several ounces of milk to each portion then heat (about 2 minutes, 45 sec.). Wisk briefly to get smooth consistency. Using 2% or whole milk does not seem to result in much difference in structure or taste.

review/summary: It Isn't Green, for One Thing
review/text: This tea brews a light reddish-brown liquor, not unlike the color of iced black tea you'd be served in a restaurant.  I was stunned the first time I made it.  The dry leaves appear to be very dark green.  There are whole jasmine flowers in the tea.  They shouldn't be there; at least very few.  Lots of flower buds is indicative of poor quality tea.  I examined the leaves after brewing.  They appear to be a blend of green and black; possibly some oolong.  The leaves are chopped and there is a great deal of stem.<br /><br />The eight-ounce double seal tin packaging is excellent.  It's too bad the tea is so, well, not as described.  Despite the presence of jasmine buds, there is no jasmine fragrance.  A fragrant jasmine tea also has a jasmine "taste," as taste and smell dovetail.  There is no jasmine taste to this tea.  It has a rather pleasant, fruity taste, but not at all jasmine, not entirely green, and poor quality tea.<br /><br />Pass on this.  There are lots of good jasmine greens you can find at very reasonable prices.

review/summary: Good jasmine tea
review/text: This is a nice clean, dark and fragrant jasmine green tea blend. Unlike heavily processed machine tea blends, you can actually see the dried leaves and jasmine flowers. I'm currently using it with an iced tea machine, but since it brews hot I'll sometimes steal a mug before I put the pitcher into the refrigerator. I like my teas straight up black, no sugar or milk, so the flavor needs to stand up on its own. This one does. I love the old-school tin as well. If this is out of stock, a good alternative is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E268">Stash Premium Organic Jasmine Green Tea, Loose Leaf, 3.5-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>. The Stash tea is more expensive per ounce, however, and it's not quite as good.<br /><br />EDIT: When I originally wrote this review, the tea was far more fragrant and you'd get 3 tins for the same price. As of 2011, it's only 1 tin and while still good, not as highly recommended at all.

review/summary: competitive price and my cats love
review/text: What can we kitty owners do when our cats choose to only eat pricy products? My cats only fancy feast elegant entree and only 4 or 5 of these types. This is one of their favorites. The vet from NY Humane Society on 59th Street said, "Well for commercial foods, this is the best, so although I'd like Starr to have something better if she refuses to eat (kitty is skinny) then let her eat. It has less ash than most and is better made." So I agree and let the kitties eat what they like and the vet says ok! Occasionally I purchase elsewhere for bargains, but it is hard to get a better bargain and it is very convenient to have it sent on a schedule. I've got 4 hungry cats, Starr is only 6 1/2 pounds, Cleo is 7 1/2, Davie is 9 and Big Boy Mushka is 14 - he's a British Blue. He eats the most. They are all spoiled!

review/summary: Greenies Allergy Formula Pill Pockets for Dogs
review/text: I love this product. I have to give my dog medicine on a daily basis and he takes them like treats using pill pockets. I normally buy the capsule (as opposed to tablet) size and just pull off as much as I need to cover the size pill Dexter has to take. This makes the product last longer. Dexter thinks they're a treat and just gobbles it down medicine and all.<br /><br />The one draw back for me is the smell of the Allergy formula pockets - it's pretty bad! I've used the beef flavor in the past and don't remember the smell being so bad. I had to stop using the beef formulas because after finally reading the ingredients I found it had chicken broth/stock in it and my dog is allergic to chicken. Not sure why they put chicken of any kind in a beef version but I've found this in many beef products.

review/summary: My dog can still taste the pills, and spits them out
review/text: My dog had been taking pills without issue for several months.  Due to a recent surgery, her daily pill count has gone up dramatically, and it has become increasingly difficult to get her to take them. I have heard many people saying how wonderfully these pill pockets work, so I finally decided to give them a try.  First, I think they are ridiculously expensive (although reasonable at Amazon, these cost almost 30% more at my local pet store, where I unfortunately bought them).  Second, if the pills taste bad (particularly if they are tablets that are cut in half to lower the dosage), it is likely that your dogs will still spit them out if they are anything like mine.  I was hoping for the magic solution to pill taking, but this is not it.

review/summary: The dogs love these.
review/text: Our vet prescribed medication for one of our dogs (a medium sized pill) that she refused to swallow.  We tried the Pill Pockets and night became day.  Our dog now looks forward to taking her medication in the morning and at night.  In fact our other dog thinks she should have one of these "treats" at the same time.  We're able to split the Pill Pocket in half so it only takes one to cover both the morning and evening medications.  The Pill Pockets are moist, can be divided into 2 pieces by hand, and can be molded around the pill to cover sharp edges.  What a great product.

review/text: I should have realized it from the picture that these pill pockets are for DOGS! I searched "Greenies pill pocket cats" and this popped up. I saw the price and thought, "Hey! That's great" and placed my order. I didn't even notice the mistake until I opened the package and went to pull out a pill pocket and it was huge!<br />  That being said, I think Greenies Pill Pockets are awesome! My cat will eat them without any fuss and I do not have to worry about how I will give him his pills. But before you order, just make sure you're ordering for the type of pet you want to be ordering for!

review/summary: Greenie Pill Pockets are my friend.
review/text: I have a dog with arthritis and hates to take pills. She does not gulp her food, she chews everything. I wrapped the pill in everything to entice her to take it.  It is bitter, not only to the taste but she could  smell it in everything I tried. Braunswager (sp) Vienna Sausage, everything.  I wrap it well in the Greenie Pill Pocket and she eats it right up. I ordered two packages and both contents were in perfect shape.  No crumbs, no pieces, none smashed as I have read in other reviews.  Since the stores that carry these are not in my immediate shopping area, I find it's easier to order from Amazon along with other items I need. I will order again and I have already recommended to a friend and neighbor.

review/text: I'd always heard of Pill Pockets and thought they were just stupid. Why pay a lot for treats with a hole in them when you can just wrap some cheese around the pill? Until my dog got so sick she refused to eat anything at all. The vet gave me some of these to try, and she would eat them and the pills inside right away, when she refused to eat anything else.<br /><br />I've also discovered they make great training treats, because you can break off small pieces without dropping crumbs everywhere. I've always had problems with treats that leave crumbs because my dogs spend more time hunting for crumbs than listening to me. Wish I'd started using these years ago!

review/summary: This is a great size for savings!
review/text: I have used well over a dozen of the beef flavored 3.2 oz, tablet size. The Amazon.com Prime supply ran out of the 3.2 size, so I thought I'd go ahead and try these. One of my dog's daily liver supplements are rather large. Still, it fits in a half of one of this size. Just 1/4 will cover his smaller daily meds. I use a knife to cut them, but it's hardly necessary. The pill pockets easily mold around any shape.<br /><br />Even though the prices vary, it's still just a few cents more for this size. Twice as much, for a few pennies! Makes the pill pockets way more affordable for me.<br /><br />My 14 year old dog still takes them, even when he's not feeling very well. Makes pill taking a treat, rather than an upsetting battle.

review/text: I was hoping this would be as good as the beef & chicken pill pockets but these were dry and rubbery.  I had a hard time getting the pocket to stay wrapped around the pill.  AND it really smells - not too good - although my dog doesn't seem to be turned off by that. (Of course with most dogs - the smellier the better....)  She does appear to like the taste - just wish it wasn't as rubbery as these seem to be.  Maybe it's because of it being `Allergy Formula' and doesn't contain the stuff that keeps it from being dry?  The number of ingredients is a lot less than the beef pockets....

In one pill pocket we can get the two capsules, powder supplement and a large chewable tablet that he gets in the morning.  He has never spit it out or not taken it.  We use two bags a month so we needed a cheaper source than the local retail stores, we looked on-line and Amazon has the best price. I can buy a six month supply and it doesn't break the bank.  Good product, great price and super quick delivery.

review/summary: No More Hassles
review/text: These make giving your pet medicine as easy as giving them a treat. Most people don't know these can also be used with liquids. My older dog has always been good at taking pills anytime we want her to, but now her medicine is in drop form.  She needs to take 10 drops twice a day.  It is very hard to know if she is really getting what she is intended without the Pill Pockets. Just put the drops in the pocket and pinch it shut. If you are using the Pill Pockets for pills and have a pet that knows all the tricks try this. Put the pill in the pill pocket with one hand and close the pocket with the other. Never touch the pocket with the hand that touched the pills, your pet can tell. Take another pocket or two with nothing in it break it into a couple of pieces and give it to your pet as a treat. Try this treat, treat with pill, and treat again.

I do not like choking pills down the dogs, and they don't like it either! Now, everybody is happy.  I also checked this product at Petco and Petsmart-much higher, almost double.  One piece of advice is the beef is a little better on the hands and doesn't feel quite so slimy.  I prefer the beef.  My youngest Schnauzer did figure out the pill part, but that was easy to deal with. Just act like you are going to give another, and they wolf it down. lol

review/summary: Finally...
review/text: I have to admit, I was skeptical of these to begin with.  Our dog is a master of avoiding medication.  We've tried shoving pills down her throat, we've tried squirting liquid medication into her mouth, we've tried hiding pills in her food, we've even tried grinding tablets or opening caplets and mixing the powder with her food.  She's always able to avoid it.  Even when we mix it with her food, she'll refuse to eat for days.<br /><br />These things actually work though.  I highly recommend the smaller size, because the larger size requires a bit of chewing, and so our dog was able to remove one of the pills once.  Even 29/30 is pretty good.  The small ones are perfect though - 60/60 and counting.  Even if the pill is slightly too big, you can just mold the treat around it so it can't be immediately detected.<br /><br />I wish I had found these years ago...

review/summary: Pill Pockets Help Reluctant Pill Takers
review/text: We first encountered these at a vet's office and tried them, but recently I have been buying via Amazon for convenience and price. The capsule ones help get various pills, including fish oil, into our two dogs. They gobble them down. They are very soft and can be reformed around whatever pill(s) you are giving. I did try the chicken and couldn't stand the smell of them myself, although the dogs were happy with either kind. These are a tiny bit greasy, so I always put a napkin down on the counter before inserting pills, and the smell will persist until you wash your hands (or you will continue to be pestered by yours dogs! This has been a great solution to get most pills down without the dog spitting them out.

review/summary: Pill pockets, what a great idea!
review/text: This is the best thing ever for giving meds in pill form to a pet.  Each little "pocket" is the consistency of a soft brownie.  So they are easy to mold around even a large pill.  I have 2 dogs and both take meds with these, no picking them apart, they just swallow them whole!  Both of my dogs are small (20#) so I usually don't even use a whole pocket for their meds, I break one in half and it's plenty to cover the pill.  Great solution and really makes things so much easier when pets are sick and not even wanting to eat.  I will always keep these on hand now.

I then make her work for it by giving a few commands "sit, stay, come, etc" and she does them excitedly. After she gets her treat, she is so excited that she does a lap around the apartment. Overall, these pill pockets are a winner and I will use them as long as she keeps getting pills!

These little gems are amazing. If you're dog can smell a pill from a mile away, try these. Sometimes in his morning dose, I have to dip it in gravy (which I buy at KFC every couple weeks and keep in the fridge), but that's the most additional effort I've had to exert since we started with these. Get them, use them, enjoy them. Warning, they're pretty stinky, IMO, so don't spend too much time sniffing them.

review/text: my dog will eat anything wrapped in one of these pill pockets. if you only have a pill to give your dog, then break it in half and wrap it around the tablet- makes a bag go twice as long! sure beats using peanut butter to disguise a pill- healthier too!

review/summary: A life saver...
review/text: I was so relieved when I found this product. Our doberman was having serious skin allergies and had to take antibiotics and steroids in pill form. He was so crafty with the pills - we would hide them in wet dog food, only to find the food eaten and the pills spit out. We hid them in salami, raw meat, pastrami, turkey, soft cheese, hard boiled egg, anything that you could think of that is appetizing to a dog and he would eat the food and spit out the pills. It got so bad that he actually stopped eating and drinking. He was so sick. Our vet put him on IV fluids and steroids and antibiotics and these wreaked havoc on his liver. We were so worried. He was going down the drain. Then I found this product. Simple as that, we put the medicine in the treat and he wolfed it down. He actually got to the point that when the 6 hour time was coming around to "get the treat" he would start whining and staring at the refrigerator where I had prepared the whole dosage plan ahead of time and put them into a plastic box with big lettering, "THIS IS ALEX'S MEDICINE - NOT CHOCOLATE!" We had a close call with my little sister - they looked appetizing to her as well! :) Now I use these for his vitamins and for anything that he has to take that is not appetizing. Really a life saver! I now buy Greenies Pill Pockets in bulk - by the 6 pack.

review/summary: Love Them!!!! and so does the my dog!
review/text: This past winter was so cold my fury friend and I didn't venture out much. Then along came Spring, and it rained, and it rained, and it rained.  Again, not out much. In April I noticed she was starting to lose hair on her back end, backside of her legs, and her back sides. :-( After a trip to the vet, I was told she would need about 6mg of Melatonin twice a day till her hair fully returned. Turns out it was happening to a lot of Boxers this year in our area due to the lack of sunlight exposure (cold winter/rainy spring). Well, giving her a heart worm pill every month is tragic in and of itself....we both hate it. So the thought of trying to shove pills down her throat twice a day, EVERY DAY, was not appealing. Then I stumbled across these pill pouches! I can't sing their praises loud enough!!!!!! Made giving her the meds each day like giving her a treat, and that's what she thought too.  We also now give her the heart worm meds in these! Our lives are much less stressful with the help of this wonderful item!  And in case you are wondering.....yes, her hair returned! We now take the supplement once a day just to be sure all is well. She still loves the taste and waits for it each morning! Now, if we could only invent something that would make trimming her toenails less of a wrestling match!

review/summary: Totally Worth the money!!!
review/text: I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!

review/text: These are AMAZING!  I have a very slippery and sneaky cat who needed medication before a trip.  I stuck the little tablet inside the snack, put two down on the floor, and she ate them both.  No stress, no drama, no cleaning up medicine from the floor.  I will be keeping these on hand, and recommending them to everyone I know.  If your kitty is hard to medicate, you should definitely try these.

review/summary: Works great; Get the CAPSULE version instead for a CHEAPER option
review/text: I've had great success using the pill pockets with my dog. I've always used the tablet size before, but on a whim bought the capsule version (same price). The capsule pill pockets are so large, you can easily split them in in half (even if you're trying to hide capsule-sized pills). If you have tablet pills, I'd bet you could use one capsule-size pill pocket for every 3-4 pills. I will not waste money again on the tablet version of this product! Hope this helps others.

review/summary: YESSSSS!!!!
review/text: Exactly what I said when these actually worked when giving my multipoo his pills using pill pockets! He recently broke his leg and has been given many pills including pain pills, sedatives, and antibiotics. He wouldn't take them with hotdogs, cheese, or in his food. So we had to hold him while prying open his mouth and holding it shut while waiting for half of the pill to dissolve so at least he would have some of it. Not only did this lead to frustration but with his injured leg we were always concerned about him hurting himself. When he had his surgery to get his pins removed we assumed it would be the same struggle as before until we saw these at the vet's office and bought a bag. Though they were $9, we were desperate. Since he is small and we have the capsule size we usually divide them in half because the treats are soft and moldable. Now giving him his pills is no longer a hour long struggle but a treat. Thank you Pill Pockets!

review/summary: PERFECT "treat" for a dog on long-term meds!
review/text: One of our beloved dogs has seizures and is on long-term medication - and has been for a few years now. When we started giving her pills, we tried cheese, peanut butter, meat, etc... but I worried about the extra calories. Our vet recommended pill pockets and we LOVE them! She thinks it's a treat - so no medicine battles - and it is the perfect consistency so that the pills don't fall out and she can't just lick it off (like peanut butter). I use the twice-a-day medicine time as training time since these are treats to her! :-) It is super easy and we use the larger size and divide them in half for her smaller pills so the bag lasts longer. The price on Amazon (as long as I have free shipping) is GREAT and better than most pet stores. Because I can use a small portion of the pill pocket and it holds/hides the pill and she takes it greedily - I don't worry she's getting too many extra calories AND I KNOW she's getting her medicine! I hope they NEVER stop making them!

review/text: I first got these at my Vet's when my dog got ill and I didnt know how I would get the pill down her throat.. Well the Vet suggested I buy a package of these and I did.. It was so easy to give my dog her pills, I would take 2 of them and put a pill inside and I would smoosh the pills with the gooey beefy pill pocket around this giant pill.. MY dog thought it was just a treat for her, and she chewed and swallow, wanting more.. Well I didnt give her anymore cause they were for her pills only.. I saw them on Amazon and was thrilled to get the same Pill-Pockets in a bigger size for less money than buying it from my Vet's.. They come in Chicken and Beef and she loves both of them..<br />Once again Amazon came thru with a product that I have used before.. Great Job Amazon!!

review/summary: Pretty good but you can do better
review/text: Pill pockets usually work well though sometimes my dog will chew them, find the pill and spit it out.  Here's an easy way to make a vehicle for getting pills into your dog that isn't as portable as Pill Pockets but often works better. Make instant mashed potatoes substituting low-sodium beef broth for water. Add milk and butter but no salt. Make them a little on the stiff side so they're not too sticky. They store well in the fridge. Your dog will think he's getting a special treat.

review/text: We have three dogs. Two of them will let us put the pill in their throat and/or take it with a little bit of peanut butter (I know, I'm a bad dog owner for feeding them fattening treats). We also have a dog who came to us from a rescue, and who had been abused. It broke my heart to force a pill down her throat. The vet recommended Pill Pockets and sent us home with samples. Our dog loves them. She's twelve now and on a regimen of Denamarin for liver and glucosamine for her joints. I can fit both capsules in one large Pill Pocket (with a bit of wrangling) and she eats it right up. Now we both look forward to her pills in the morning.

review/summary: Wonderful!
review/text: I just had to write a review for the Greenies Pill Pockets.  Genius!  My older dog has to take 3 pills, 3x/day.  He quickly picked up on the hiding them in cheese, bread, etc., tricks. Pill giving became a time-consuming, frustrating ordeal.  Most of the time I would think I had hidden his medication well in his food, only to find them spit out on the floor.  My vet recommended the pill pockets - just the right texture and consistency to fit the 3 pills in at once.  Love how you can shape them right over the pills and pinch the top and voila' - done deal! He must love the taste because he gobbles it up every time.  You also get a decent quantity in each bag. I will use these from now on for sure.  Thanks, Greenies!

review/summary: I'd give Pill Pockets six stars if I could
review/text: These pill pockets are fabulous. You can easily mold them tightly around a capsule (or pill) and so administering medication to a dog is a snap. I've disguised pills in just about everything, but these pockets are easier and cleaner to deal with than beef stew chunks, cheddar cheese, peanut butter on bread... lol, all the goodies I've used before. The thing is, my dogs go nuts for these. I have to give one dog a pill once a week (for the duration of her life), and I swear she's looking at the calendar to see when it's pill time again -- she gets pretty excited. The other four dogs all want pill pockets, too... so I have to divide up a second pocket just to give everyone a taste treat. The smoked flavoring/scent is pretty intense and probably the key. The dogs certainly know when I've been handling one, so I'm busted if I forget to give everyone their share. :)

review/text: As the owner of a dog who takes daily medication, these are a godsend. Soft and squishier than other "hide it in food" options, this works like a charm and is easily molded to any size pill and my dog LOVES them. It turns medicine into a no headache, treat time that he actually looks forward to. No really.<br /><br /> Like another reviewer I use the less expensive "pill pockets for cats" for small pills and they're just as good ... For dogs. My three cats, on the other hand, are WAY too smart to fall for it, easily eating around the pill pocket and leaving the pill. (They do like the taste too.) So, you know, there's that. Thank goodness dogs eat first and then forget to ask questions (and/or chew) later.

review/summary: Doggie Pill Pockets - wonderful invention!
review/text: These pill pockets made by Greenies are the best invention ever in getting your dog to take their medications!  They make them for cats as well.  My dog has to take a prilosec every day and I used to fight with her to take it and then I would find the pill spit out somewhere in my house...needless to say, she was getting sick because she wasnt taking her medicine.  Now, she runs to me to take her medicine!  She thinks it is a treat!  She would eat the whole bag at one sitting if she could get into it!  I highly recommend trying these pill pockets for any dog or cat that takes daily meds or for any dog or cat that hates taking medication.  These work like a charm!

review/text: This product changed my dogs' qualities of life!  3 of my dogs have been through surgery in the past year, and the ONLY way i've been able to handle their postop medications is with this product.  At some point in their postop period, each dog learned to throw-up at will upon smelling their medications.  Nothing I did could get them to keep down their essential antibiotic and anti-inflammatory pills.  I tried bread, peanut butter, REAL STEAK... they rejected everything. These pill pockets make medication time painless and even enjoyable for my dogs.  I could not rave enough about this product.  I will never put my pets through the anxiety of shoving a pill down their throat ever again.  This is SO easy and wonderful.

If you have a dog and you have ever been on the other side of trying to give it a pill, only to find it later caked to the floor, or worse, having left you covered in slobber, you will be doing yourself (and your dog) a favor.  These are very malleable, fit almost any size pill, and serve double duty as a treat.  What a concept!

review/summary: Great product for pet owners
review/text: Great product for pet owners. Our cairn terrier, Maggie, requires<br />daily allergy medication.  It's great that we don't have to struggle<br />with her to take her meds. When she sees me reach for the pill<br />pockets she knows it's time take her medicine. Been using this<br />product for a while and will order again from amazon.com.  I highly<br />recommend this product.
