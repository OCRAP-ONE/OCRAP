review/summary: Beefy, but salty
review/text: The good: the beef is cut thickly and has a steak-y taste.<br />The bad: the jerky is extremely salty to the point that it made me feel ill if I ate more than a few pieces.<br />About me: I am a rabid jerk-o-phile, and I regularly consume mass quantities of the stuff.

review/summary: Good jerky for the price
review/text: It is tender like the other guys have said, I like mine crunchy and harder, but it's not terrible.  For the price/product you get a pretty good deal considering how much jerky sells for at gas stations and stores.  I recommend it.<br /><br />Hickory:  I just tested this flavor out.  The original is much much better I think.

review/text: One pound goes a long way.  The flavor is very addicting; like doritios or something.  you get a whole pound in the pack so it lasts a while.  It is dry and stringy but that is what I like.  The price is very economical.<br /><br />I recommend a smaller pack first, to make sure you like it.  Then if you do,  you can buy this bulk pack.

Even my wife who normally dislikes jerky can eat these.  I ordered the Spicy flavor.  It has a nice blend of spice and sweetness.  Nothing overpowering.  Thumbs up for any Jerky lovers out there.  Definately better than the common store-brands.

review/summary: WideRide Hickory Beef Jerky
review/text: I receiced the order quickly of both the Hickory and the Sweet & Hot.  Have not opened the S&H yet but only the Hickory beef jerky.  The cut is very thick and meaty and not chewy at all.  I think it is too salty plus the fact that the packaging contains a large amount of crumbs (tiny bits of meats) as if they was loaded in the bag to make it one pound.  After mixing some grounded black pepper and sprinkled some sugar, the jerky tastes a lot better.

review/summary: Now THAT is some Jerky. :D
review/text: i ordered this on a whim because i love jerky, i love bbq, and Pounds of Jerky are usually around 20-25 bucks and I figured 2 bags of this brand of Jerky was a pretty sweet deal. I got barbecue and teriyaki.<br /><br />Taste is great, it was very fresh and flavorful, and the jerky was the perfect tenderness.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product. Well, the barbecue. Now the Teriyaki, that's another story. Very bland flavor, tasted like regular beef jerky that was thrown in some teriyaki sauce for a few minutes before packaging, definitely nowhere near the quality of the bbq. Same great tenderness though. I can't wait to try the other flavors. :D

review/summary: YUMMO!!!
review/text: This is great jerky! Tender, but still chewy and satisfying (not like shoe leather!); the slightly thicker slice on the meat is great. I really appreciate the salty/sweet taste of the Hickory marinade, with its nice hint of black pepper. I think they got it just right. There is enough spice to satisfy adult taste buds, and I don't think the heat will overwhelm older children, but for the little ones, the Teriyaki flavor is sweeter and less spicy. This is definitely a product the whole family will enjoy. Now, if they would just include a small packet of dental floss in each bag, it would be perfect!

review/text: Solid strips of flavorful beef, slightly tenderized with natural papaya enzymes, gives this jerky a nice bite without stressing out your jaw muscles. Pleasant natural smoke and pepper flavor doesn't overwhelm like so many other brands - the beef flavor comes through. Very low fat (0.5 g) and carb (1 g)per 1 oz serving make this jerky my South Beach Phase 2 snack of choice. Great for an on-the-go protein fix. BTW - 1 oz is a substantial portion to snack on!!!

review/summary: Different People, Different Tastes
review/text: I guess there's no accounting for people's tastes. After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready for a taste treat. Not what I got.<br /><br />I've had many different jerkies, and made my own several times. In the old days, jerky was made to keep without refrigeration, and to have a handy food to carry along on the trail. Also to cover the taste of what was probably less than fresh beef.<br /><br />I like a spicy flavor, with just a little bite to it, sometimes a little sweet, sometimes with a teriyaki flavor.<br /><br />This product (at least the original flavor) is none of these things. It tastes like a piece of steak was partially cooked and partially dried with no added spices or flavors. Just a dull piece of meat. Gone also is the leathery texture of the jerky I'm used to. It is slightly chewy, but not the texture of real jerky that takes time to chew and allows you to enjoy it for awhile.<br /><br />So if that bland tasteless type of jerky is your cup of tea, this may be for you. It just doesn't ring my bell.<br /><br />Somewhat of a disappointing purchase.

Looks I've learned that grocery shopping on Amazon is not a particularly good idea.  Since I bought three different 1lb bags of this stuff in different flavors I'm out some cash.  Granted this one was the only one with mold, but the other two were complete inedible as they were made from cartilage scrap cuts - the stuff that either gets thrown away or fed to the pigs.  This flavor probably was, too, but since it has mold on it I'm not about to find out.

It's usually an after effect like being thirsty. I really regret buying this and would much rather go back to Jack Link's X stick which are less nutritious and taste more like meat flavored than real meat.<br /><br />Salty taste aside, the pieces are thick and are of medium toughness (i.e., prepare to use some mouth muscles), which are good. Unfortunately, I sometime run into overly chewy pieces.

review/text: I love my beef jerky and this is the style I like at a great price, especially if subscribed. At $11 for a pound shipped, how can anyone complain? Since preferences differ, I'd class myself as disliking the moist style beef jerky that have become popular in recent years, I would say this is similar jack links, a bit more dehydrated. My favorite used to be a bone dry japanese brand I cant seem to find anymore. It's not quite that dry, and they do tenderize it it in some manner. However, not over processed so you'll some across vein and fat as some reviewer complained of, but it give it a very natural texture. I give it 5 stars although its not perfect in consideration of the absolutely low cost as 4 1/2 isn't an option.

Now it says " naturally hickory smoked", or the like.  WHO CARES.  your jerky has so much cr_p in it that naturally smoking it makes no difference.  This jerky is full of salt.  this jerky is packed with MSG - and i mean PACKED!!!  This jerky is quite greasy. NOTE:  Bulk packaging ( 1 lb bags) are a bit better than smaller bags, and meat type in bulk bags is different.  YES&lt; this company has absolutely zero consistency.  If you take 20 chunks out of a bulk bag, you will see that there are 4-5 different kinds of meats there.  some wil be moist and chewy, others will be nothing but rubber, some with thick tendons running through, and some are quite marbled.  Just when you find a piece to your liking - you are back searching for a lucky chunk again.  smaller bags, especially teriyaki is very greasy and has so much coating that you taste all the chemicals way before you get to meat flavor ( if you can call it that).<br /><br />i'd give this jerky a 2 if there was meat consistency, but its a total crap shoot.  you can find LOTS of other - better tasting jerky in the same price range, here on amazon.  even the middle of the road obertos is much better than this stuff.  WILD RIDE JERKY IS A JOKE and IS GROSS.  Buy at your own risk, but know that you are buying a truly chemically processed and preserved jerky - full of MSG and 0ther additives.<br /><br />OH, and those 1 lb cowboy stips bags?  Well,  there was exactly 10 oz of strips in a bag - rest was jerky shavings and bitsNpieces - similar to what oberto sells as bulk packages salad topper shavings of jerky - NO STRIPS!!!  we tried every flavor in their bulk=-packaged variety and this holds true for every single package.

review/summary: Decent taste, cheap meat
review/text: I did not like the taste or texture of Wild Ride Original but decided to give the company one more chance as this flavor was on sale.  While the flavor is better, unfortunately the meat is of such poor quality that it's difficult to recommend.  I uploaded three images as examples of what you will find in a typical bag.  You'll see that about 10-15% of the pieces are marbled in a high amount of fat which is odd because meat was originally smoked not only to add flavor but to get rid of fat so it would last longer.  I'm not sure what's happening here.  Some pieces have hardened grease settling on them, most likely due to the meat being smoked on something similar to a conveyor belt as opposed to hanging in a smoker.  Finally, the pieces that don't have any apparent fat or grease may still contain gristle as another reviewer mentioned.  It's not horrible, but it is of low quality to match its low price.  I wouldn't recommend it to any serious jerky lovers but you can check the at the top of the page and decide for yourself.

review/summary: Moldy meat.
review/text: I bought two bags (original) which were delivered to me on November 16th...<br /><br />The first bag was good. It had soft pieces of jerky mixed with annoying hard pieces of jerky. The meat has a nice fat to meat ratio, you know when you bite down on a fatty piece of meat. However, the hard pieces had tendon or sinew. On some pieces I could pull the silver sinew out and use it to floss my teeth. Not palatable at all. Generally the jerky is somewhat grainy due to the spices but is palatable. A strong peppery taste permeated the jerky. I felt like some of the pieces were not mixed properly, some pieces of meat were more salty than others.<br /><br />The taste is quite enjoyable. (I'm known to eat anything... & can acquire taste) If you don't mind fishing out the bad parts...<br /><br />However, my second bag developed some kind of mold. I started on the second bag without knowing that this bag contained a mold ball right in the middle of the bag. About half way through I found the moldy meat. I had read of this occurring in some people's product but I dismissed it as a freak chance.<br /><br />The mold is white, it reminds me of bread fluff. The mold is very bitter. I just reached into the bag for a piece of jerky & bit down on a moldy piece. I promptly spat it out and saw the middle part of the bag was fully rotten. IMHO.<br /><br />Would I buy this product again?<br /><br />No. a 50% chance of getting moldy meat... Well I don't wanna chance it.

review/summary: No Better Taste, Worse Nutrition Than Local Brands, Higher Price
review/text: It gets one star for the price, fat and salt content and because it's 3.65 oz. rather than the 4 oz. in brands available in local groceries.  The pieces were thick and flat, which is more attractive than the wrinkly stuff.  But the fat content is 13% compared to a more typical 2% and delivers 35 fat calories per 1 oz serving compared to a typical 5 calories from fat in a 1 oz. serving from the three different brands our local Kroger Grocery carries.  All that fat didn't make it more tender or less chewy.  And that fat is displacing protein in a 1 oz serving, so 1 0z. delivers 90 calories instead of 70.  And there was 520 mg salt compared to 470 from the store brands.<br /><br />Unless this just hits your palate in some incredible way, can't understand why anyone would buy this product.

review/summary: Best Matcha I've found so far!
review/text: I am very into health and will research every product I consume until I am certain it's worthy.  I've tried 3 different organic matchas in the past and this is, by far, the best.<br /><br />This is a vibrant green color (very pretty color - especially when made)This is proof that young leaves were chosen and dried properly.  The brighter, the better.  Some matchas are dull green (dirty pea green color) - these are more of a food grade matcha (for baking, ice creams, etc.).  Food grade matchas have a dull taste as well. Ceremonial (drinking) tea should always be vibrant.  This is an excellent drinking tea.<br /><br />The packaging is the best I've seen.  Not only does it come in a sealed pop/top can, but once opened you will find your tea inside a sealed foiled bag. Impressive. A bit of a mess to empty the contents back into the can, but it makes for a very fresh tea.<br /><br />The taste of this tea is the cleanest I've tasty. Not at all bitter as some I've had. This is definitely the only matcha I will be ordering.<br /><br />From my research and own experience. I highly recommend keeping your matcha in the fridge to keep fresh.

review/summary: Excellent Quality Matcha at a Good Price
review/text: Having tried two different matcha powders thus far from Amazon.com, I am extremely impressed by the quality of DoMatcha's product. The other product I had ordered from Tao of Tea, while cheaper and 3 times the size and also of Japanese origin, simply does not compare to the fresh appearance and taste of DoMatcha's product. Exceptionally vibrant green color out of the box that turns into an extremely lush, dark forest green color upon addition of water, with an exceptionally fresh taste to match. If the matcha powder Starbuck's uses is taken as a token standard of like 100, Tao of Tea's matcha would be 80 or 90, while DoMatcha would be at least 125. The former two have colors of dull green and greenish-yellow respectively after water is mixed in with the matcha.<br /><br />I have not tried the really high-quality, really expensive premium matcha with elegant Japanese names and calligraphy on the cases they come in. But I am willing to bet that DoMatcha can quite hold its own against the super-premium labels/brands of matcha out there.

review/summary: Good matcha for beginners and health conscious
review/text: If it was my first matcha i would had given it 5 starts but I feel i have to disagree with the majority of reviewers.<br />Its certainly a good quality matcha but i found it lacks aroma and taste compared to other matchas i tried(yuuki-cha, o-cha and ippodo). The taste is very light, almost flat and you have to watch the water temperature as when going over 190 it gets very bitter(never had this problem before). By the way I always preheat my chawan, dry it, sift the matcha, check the water temperature and then whisk it.<br />As for packaging thats the first matcha i tried that comes in a inner bag. Personally i find it annoying and messy not to mention that you will have to expose the whole amount of matcha to oxygen in order to make it easier to scoop. i prefer the cans i got before that comes with sealed top and a oxygen absorber inside. I noticed the loss of flavor from Domatcha much faster than usual.<br />Would i buy it again? maybe. Cant beat the amazon fast ordering convenience. sometimes my japanese orders take too long to arrive and i found myself out of my daily green nectar. otherwise i think the extra money im paying for a higher quality is more than worth since my primary reason to drink matcha is flavor.<br />One more thing: dont bother trying to make koicha(thick ceremony style tea) with domatcha. its not the proper grade for it and you will get a very grainy/powdery/bitter drink. Otherwise it makes a good usucha and its certainly a great value for the price.

review/summary: RESEARCH THIS!!!
review/text: I have now tried several different Matcha's. THIS IS THE BEST OF THE BEST<br /><br />I am very sensitive to substances that go into my body. Do your research. I did.<br /><br />I drink Green Tea for the health benefits. I am 61 years old now. My metabolism has slowed. My brain never tolerated caffeine very well. And, I do not want or like to be physically addicted to any drug (caffeine). When I was in Iraq, I drank caffeinate concentrated coffee (1 can of triple shot) per day. When I missed a day or two, my body went into a sluggish withdrawal with headache/stuffy brain. That was awful.<br /><br />I read about this Do Matcha Green Tea and how the other substances (Catechins, etc.) in it were so healthful and that the caffeine was low. I tried it and found there were no withdrawal symptoms after drinking one cup every day for a week. To my surprise it was just as uplifting as the Triple Shot had been, but with less than a third of the caffeine. It also had a very calming effect and produced a mental clarity I enjoyed in my 20's and 30's.<br /><br />The other Matcha's I tried because of cheaper price failed to produce the mental clarity. Mental clarity is what I missed the most in getting older. Only Do Matcha first harvest (Ceremonial Grade) has produced this. Read up on this so that I do not have to write so much to impart knowledge to those who do not know.<br /><br />I do not drink this for the taste. I drink it for the health benefits. The others DO NOT measure up to Do Matcha!!!<br /><br />You get what you pay for. Many extoll the different mixes they use Green Tea for. That is not me. I drink it straight with cool water. I don't want to lose any of the nutrition because of heated water. I use a battery operated frother to mix it. I like the veggie taste (like raw spinach). It is a quick drink that uplifts, enlivens, and clarifies. If you need to enhance your life. Pay for this. Yes, it is expensive... and worth the extra cost if you value your health.<br /><br />My body has become more supple. No more morning stiffness. No more morning grogginess. No more sore feet when getting out of bed. I have been using Do Matcha (and tried others) for 7 months now. I can quit without any signs of withdrawal. But, the age factors set in again.<br /><br />So, one cup a day of Do Matcha seems to be quite therapeutic for me.

review/summary: The best green tea you can buy for the price.
review/text: This green tea is not brewed and then the leaves thrown out. You drink the whole leaf crushed into a powder getting all the phytonutrients and benefits that tea bags cannot give you. It becomes a superfood when you get it this way. Check out the website domatcha.com for more information but get the product here because it is cheaper. For even more info on the health benefits of this type of tea go to mercola.com then do a search in Products for Royal Matcha. This one though, is even more expensive and not any better than Do Matcha that I can tell after doing alot of research.<br /><br />I drink this every day and it makes me more alert and sharp of mind without the crash of caffeine and stimulants. It does not taste like much, it has a very mild 'spinachy' taste, but I don't drink it because it tastes so good, I drink it for mental clarity, emotional support and for my health and immune support. I don't put it in hot water. I put it in about 24 ounces of room temperature water and agitate it with an egg whisk to blend it with the water, otherwise it clumps, hot or cold. They try to sell you a wooden whisk but I use the metal one that I already had and it works great. Just agitate it really good by rolling the handle back and forth in your hands in the drink very quickly until it is foamy and well blended and drink right away.

review/summary: A feel good drinking experience.
review/text: I'm not a health nut by any means, yet I have often enjoyed a nice hot cup of green tea when I'm at my favorite sushi bar.  However, when I'd tried my hand at making green tea with packets, I could never come close to replicating the flavor and texture of the tea that I'd grown accustomed to at said sushi bar.  I'd even tried the $3 cup of green tea at Starbucks and it was a bitter experience for me.<br /><br />On a whim I decided to search out a better green tea experience and I found this gem here on Amazon.  The tin that the tea comes in was sealed securely.  Upon opening the tin, inside there was a sealed bag that I opened and poured into the tin carefully.  The arouma of the tea before brewing is pleasant to say the least - it has a fresh and mild scent that is not overbearing.  Brewing the tea was as simple as adding a small amount (about half a teaspoon) to a cup of warm to hot water.  I would not recommend boiling water as I did try that once and the tea clumped up at the bottom of the cup.<br /><br />This green tea looks and tastes wonderful.  I don't like adding sugar or sweeteners to my tea so it was an all natural taste.  It's got a smooth flavor and is not at all bitter like many other brands I've tried.  It tastes just as good as the green tea from the sushi bar and I'm more than pleased with it.  As a side note, I notice that some reviews recommend using ceremonial tools to enhance the experience.  I may try those tools in the future, but for now I am happy with the results of my rudimentary method for brewing.<br /><br />One tip - remember that less is sometimes more.  This small tin can last awhile if you ration the amount of tea you use per serving.  Use too much and you may experience clumping at the bottom.  Happy drinking!

review/text: I would give it six or seven stars here if they allowed it.  You get what you pay for, my friends, and this is the MOST HEAVENLY thing on earth to drink--tastewise and healthwise.  However, I will tell you that we use 1/2 Teaspoon in a 1 pint bottle of Lipton ICED green tea.  See my review of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM6PS0">Lipton Green Tea, Mandarin Orange, Premium Pyramid Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> for the recipe.  I make a pot every morning and have completely replaced the morning coffee ritual with green tea.  It gives you the right lift and does not let you down at 11 am.  We still have 3 pm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H6UX0Y">Senseo Douwe Egberts Colombia Blend Coffee Pods, 16-Count Packages (Pack of 4)</a> on days when we exercise, but we've broken our addiction to coffee with cream now.<br /><br />It has the most EGCG and mixed catacholamine antioxidants of any green tea product you can imagine.  There is a small insert with the packaging that details the contents for you and also contains the recipe for a Green Tea Frappachino that looks just great.<br /><br />We tried to "do it on the cheap" with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BVNSFW">Vita Life Matcha (Green Tea Powder) - 10.58 Oz Twin Pack - 2x10.58 Oz</a> but it has an aftertaste that I don't really like.  The Do Matcha is the real article, and it's organic as well.  It's so concentrated that it's actually economical.  You will save $4.00 every time you make your own Starbuck's Green Tea Frappachino.  If you want to know what this tastes like go try one of those which are fantastic but contain a lot of calories and fat:  our iced tea with Do Match is much healthier and every bit as delicious.

review/summary: Exceptional matcha, but organic certifications add too much cost
review/text: For the vast majority of people, a functionally identical product is the non-organic version, which saves a large part of this rather premium price:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019FR0F8">DoMatcha Green Tea, Matcha, 1.06-Ounce Tin</a>.<br /><br />Though this is some of the best Matcha available (especially for Amazon Prime junkies like me), IMHO the premium that the organic certification adds is too large.  I am sure the administrative overhead and more expensive processes genuinely account for most of the markup, but DoMatcha seems to take great care to ensure that their regular products are never contaminated.  Additionally, considering the relatively small quantity of material you are actually ingesting, even pesticide-drenched, badly washed leaves would carry less poison in a dozen tins than a single non-organic potato sometimes does!<br /><br />For those who buy organic for moral reasons, drinkers who have special health requirements relative to farming processes, and the lucky few with an excess of cash---this is the best Matcha I have found on Amazon.  Otherwise, get the cheaper equivalent.  Either way, you'll love it!

review/text: I never knew about Matcha Green Tea, this weekend while I was at our local Whole Foods, a lady approached me asking if I would like to try some tea and to have a demonstration. She made me a cup with a special whisk which creates a beatiful froth. I have never been a fan of the tast of green tea (I like the Rishi loose leave tea with the Jasmine) due to the stinky smell and ususually have to have it in some blend.  However, this one had more of a wheat grass smell and taste to it.  I didn't buy it initially and went back today to buy it - I googled it and found it on amazon for $7.00 less and am ordering more along with the whisk.  I tried using a regular one but after watching her prepare it - it wasn't the same and it didn't have that same frothy taste.  I'm curious for the regular Matcha drinkers how many glasses they make a day or if just one.  She also said I could add it to my protein shakes as well in the morning if I didn't like the taste and it would give me the same health benefits.  Love it.

review/text: The flavor isn't as complex as others I've had, but it is pleasing and more than adequate. The color is a nice deep "matcha green". The aroma and taste of the dry powder are good. It whisks into an even, fine foam. I recommend it.

review/summary: Great tea, but very small tin.
review/text: This was the first time I had ever tried Matcha Tea. I read the reviews and thought it sounded great. I decided to pay the high price for this tea because of the reviews it got. I was absolutely shocked when I received the tea, however. It comes in a tiny tin. Inside the tiny tin is a tiny foil pouch. Inside the tiny foil pouch is a silicone packet to keep the tea dry. There was a lot of tea "stuck" to this little packet. So basically you get about two tablespoons of tea, if that, for well over $20. To me it looked like a "sample" product that would be worth a couple of dollars.<br /><br />Yes, the tea is a lovely shade of green. I made my own recipe of chai spices with ginger, cloves and cinnamon. I added frothed, unsweetened almond milk. It was good, but not good enough to justify paying that much. Fortunately I am never dissatisfied with Amazon.com because, as always, they offer immediate refunds for products that don't live up to their standards of customer satisfaction.<br /><br />I'm going to try another organic green tea that is highly rated next time. I probably won't be able to tell any difference. I'm sure this product is good tea. The question is whether or not it's so much better than the other highly-rated green teas that it is worth close to $24 for a couple of cups. For me it is not. This is yet another experience with Amazon that proves I can't go wrong buying through them. Thanks, Amazon, for truly making shopping a risk-free adventure.<br /><br />I am now editing my original review and I have changed the rating from 2 to 4 stars. There is no other matcha tea like this one. It gives me energy. It tastes great. The kind of energy it gives me is a sense of calm, well-being, and energy without any jittery feeling. It lasts many hours, but I don't "crash." I like it, and it's worth the extra money. I will be ordering it again.

review/summary: Wow, from a Matcha novice.
review/text: I had tried some matcha prior from Red Leaf Tea (admittedly their mid grade matcha of which they have 3) and I did enjoy it but found that the experience was not worth the premium I paid.<br /><br />I again am overwhelmed at the cost. I'm sure I could buy quality illegal substances on the street for cheaper. If like the more vehement proponents claim it is the cure for depression, cancer, heart disease, human suffering and Donald Trump it might be worth it, but scientifically it seems to be only the more basic claims have been substantiated. That's enough for me to work my way into the matcha world, but there is that retirement I've been eyeing.<br /><br />That having been said I will say that the increase in price is certainly in line with the increase I have tasted in quality. I am very happy with this DoMatcha matcha. The color is almost neon green, it bubbles up quite a bit and has a mellow but full sweet/grassy vegetal taste. It's fairly strong but mild and smooth if that makes sense.<br /><br />All in all very impressive but since I plan to drink about 5 cups of green tea a day that would run me hundreds per month, so I'll have to find a sweet spot between quality and price and I'm not sure this is it.<br /><br />If you want a treat I would get this or the highest quality ipoddo (which seems to come much higher recommended), but for a daily drinking tea I might recommend Red Leaf's caramel matcha lowest grade.

review/summary: I've only tried 3 kinds of Matcha, but VERY happy with this one.
review/text: The first time I ever tried Matcha, it was almost a brownish-green color, which I eventually learned, is not a premium grade.  This DoMatcha was nearly 4x the price (ounce vs. ounce), but the quality is clearly way, way better.  Not only that, this DoMatcha tea gives me great energy, without any jitters or feeling spacey, like the other one made me feel.<br /><br />I have always been a big Starbucks Green Tea Latte kind of guy.  I love those things to death.  BUT, the Vente would cost me $4.30 every day.  Even with the very high price tag of this DoMatcha, I can duplicate the same formula for almost 1/4 the price, and I can also use a sweetener of my choice, which is Xylitol.  I can keep it low glycemic, organic, and sugar free, and pay a fraction of the Starbucks price.  It's great.<br /><br />My only beef with the DoMatcha is the packaging.  The tin is great, but the tea itself comes in a sealed silver pouch inside, which is VERY messy.  I eventually dumped the tea out of the pouch into the tin, but I probably lost 1/2 to 1 full serving in the process.  Powder was flying everywhere.  Perhaps I'll get better at the exchange in time, but that was the ONLY bad thing I have to say about this premium Matcha formula.<br /><br />I'll definitely be buying again, but perhaps the 2nd Harvest one the next time, since it's about 1/2 the price, but still remains organic.

review/summary: Best Taste!
review/text: Of the Matcha I have tried, this has the best taste by far--bright and fresh, not "fishy" or grass clipping flavored like cheaper stale matcha one often finds for sale.  It may seem like a small amount for one's money but one only needs a teaspoon per cup, and it's health benefits are akin to about 6 cups of regular bag-green tea.  I think it's an investment, and also, since it is organic, there is going to be no pesticide residue to worry about.

review/summary: Very nice flavor.
review/text: The only reason I give this product a 4 star rating instead of a 5 is that the caffeine level in this tea is very high.  I read a previous review on Amazon that said it was better than coffee because it had only a mild "kick" from caffeine, however, my experience was different.  I get a jolt about an hour after I drink it and it's uncomfortable for a little while, then it's okay.  I love the flavor because it's so rich and earthy (which deserves 5 stars).  I do highly recommend this product if you can handle the caffeine.

review/summary: Pretty Good Stuff
review/text: This was my first purchase of matcha green tea. I have always been a big green tea fan and I heard about the health benefits of matcha so I decided to try it. The benefits are definitely there, as you are ingesting the whole tea leaf.<br /><br />This stuff is pretty cool, brightly colored green like nothing you have ever seen before. But, to be honest the taste is nothing special. Maybe I'm making it wrong but I don't know where these other reviewers are coming from. I'll keep trying different methods in an attempt to make this stuff taste better.<br /><br />Regardless I can say this stuff is better than coffee for a boost in energy. And I love coffee. Does not have the negatives associated with coffee, such as jitters, or crashing, but instead you feel alert and attentive all day.<br /><br />I had hartley green tea bags(sancha I think) and I liked the taste of that much better.

review/summary: Very good; different from tea leaves
review/text: I drink only the best tea. There is a huge difference between tea bags and premium quality teas.<br /><br />I had yet, however, tried the Matcha tea. Being the tea-snob that I am, I decided to get the best one for my first try.<br /><br />The very first try was a disappointment. Its taste, much to my surprise, was substantially different from tea-leaf green teas. It actually had LESS taste than the premium leaf green teas. It also didn't have the same "kick" I get with preimium leaf green teas. Thinking I didn't put enough tea into my cup, so I decided to put little more.<br /><br />Then I tried to sleep and I couldn't.<br /><br />The caffeine rush in this tea is VERY subtle yet powerful. You will hardly feel it. You will feel like you are driving a Mercedes on a straight line going 100mph. You know you are going fast, but just won't feel it.<br /><br />The 2nd try, I was hooked. I realized it had only one taste: Umami. Umami is called the "5th taste" that has been scientifically validated as the 5th taste our taste buds are capable of detecting. Unlike sweetness and saltiness, Umami is subtle.<br /><br />If you have never tried Matcha tea, I highly recommend this tea. The only reason I won't give it 5 stars is because I have yet to try other Matchas and I have no idea if this one is actually better than the ones that cost half its price.

review/text: This is by far the BEST and MOST REAL honey I have ever come across with in my lifetime. It is also one of the better tasting honeys in its category. It is indeed 100% natural raw honey, which is obviously never heated, filtered or strained; hence preserving all the natural vitamins, minerals, enzymes and antioxidants found in honey. The fact that the producers decided to add pollen, propolis, and crushed honeycomb to the jar is also brilliant. Eat two table spoons of this honey everyday, I swear your life span will go up by several years. This honey is simply incredible, what a great gift from mother nature!<br /><br />The jars are also very cute. At the cost of a very reasonable shipping price, I have received my first two jars within 36 hours in perfect shape after my order. Thanks for the super fast shipping Wee-Bee.<br /><br />Don't waste this honey by spreading it on your toast or in your tea. Eat it up all by itself from the jar whenever you feel like it. This is beyond your standard honey, which is totally spoiled by heating and filtering -thanks to the profit oriented industrialists in the honey business. Wee-Bee honey is the real deal, and it is very reasonably priced. What a piece of heaven! I can't wait to order more. Thank you Wee Bee!

review/summary: Great Pasta!
review/text: This is my favorite gluten-free pasta.  I cook it exactly as the directions tell you to and I rinse it with warm water very well before serving.  It does have a slightly different flavor/texture than regular wheat pasta but if you have allergies, you can't compare everything to what you use to eat.  Rarely do I ever find anything that compares to what I ate before, but after you eat this a time or two, you will think you have been eating it all along.  My husband eats gluten/wheat and over time I stopped buying different noodles for each of us and our family eats these.  If you have children, I doubt they would even notice a difference.  These are great to have around if you are pressed for time and need a fast gluten-free meal.  I have had other pasta products from De Boles and I will admit that the other types of noodles (lasanga, penne) do not taste as good but I still use them.  You can tell they are not wheat noodles.

review/text: If I could eat gluten containing pasta I would not eat this product. But I can not eat wheat or gluten. This is the best gluten free pasta I have found. It is good as regular spaghetti with a sauce. We also use it in stir fries. Good in both. But not as good as wheat pasta.

review/summary: Yuck...
review/text: This pasta is NOT good - not for Italian dishes, at least, although it might be okay for Asian noodle dishes.  Besides the taste, it also goes gummy and sticky really easily.  Try Tinkyada's brown rice pastas instead - Tinkyada tastes almost the same as regular pasta, and cooks up firm.  You don't have to settle for strange tasting pasta just because you can't eat gluten!

review/summary: Don't overcook it otherwise it will fall apart...USDA certified?
review/text: I've never liked the flavor of wheat pasta...interestingly I used to like some wheat breads. I've opted for rice products incase of gluten sensitivity. This pasta will fall apart easily if you overcook it. So it's important to go by the directions. I prefer fewer ingredients, as this one has. I prefer the flavor of rice in pasta because they don't overpower the other flavors you may like to add from spices or tomato sauce for example, like wheat does in my opinion. One other thing is that the individual box itself doesn't state it's USDA certified? Not sure why the online ad states it is and not the box. Unless it's just mine that are like this. Sorry but for me there will be no more subscribe and save orders, the price has gone up by five (+ cents) dollars. For a family of seven and one adult working it's not as easy. If the price ever goes back down then I would reconsider it, unless I find another one to replace it.

review/summary: DeBoles Spaghetti
review/text: DeBoles Spaghetti turns out perfectly, pot after pot. The trick is bringing the water (with a little olive oil in it) to a rolling boil, before adding the pasta. Then boil for ten minutes, remove immediately, and drain. The pasta is al dente and never sticky, hard, or mushy. I will continue to buy this pasta. It is much better than NRG and other brands.

review/summary: The Real Deal Anti-Oxidant
review/text: This is like berry wine; very intense just slightly sweet flavor very reminiscent of a good dark wine, or a port. My use will be maximized by using it in my kombucha brew: maximizing the anti-oxidant potential and making a little bit go a long way. I would highly advise doing this, you can just combine an oz with other fruits in a smoothie or juice. If you can really stretch out the volume it somewhat justifies the cost. Maqui berries have yet to be fully analyzed on the ORAC scale but they are widely known to be higher than acai which ranks just over 100K, with only a dozen or so above it. Bottom line if you can make this bottle last for several months at least by combining it with other drinks you'll find it's well worth it.

review/text: These Crepe Belgian Chocolate Biscuits are quite simply put the BEST! They are very light and airy. The biscuit is very thin and covered in the milk chocolate.  They are addicting so get ready to want more. I first bought them last year at Christmas.  They are now a tradition at my house.

review/summary: disgusting
review/text: The box says the flavor has been "improved" which is a shocking claim in light of the absolutely digusting flavor and appearance of this pasta. Besides rice flour, it also contains rice bran, which I guess is supposed to give it a texture closer to wheat pasta. Well, it doesn't work, and it also gives the pasta a disturbing beige hue and a truly vomitous taste. My two year old and I spit it out almost simultaneously. The baby ate it, but she also eats lint, so what does she know.

review/summary: My Three-Year-Old Loves These!!
review/text: One of my son's favorite foods is noodles, and now that he's on a gluten-fee and corn-free diet, there wasn't much out there that he can eat. We bought these last week and tried them, and he went crazy over them! He even ate a large bowl plain, with nothing on them, then later with spaghetti sauce.<br /><br />You do need to be careful to cook them long enough that they are not a very gross version of "al dente," and not to overcook them to the point where they start to dissolve and get slimy. Be sure to also rinse with cold water, as the directions on the box indicate. As other reviewers mentioned, cooking for 10 minutes seems to work well.<br /><br />We had tried one box from the grocery, and we are now planning to buy a case here at Amazon. If you are looking for alternative noodles for a gluten-free family, I definitely recommend giving these a try. My son felt like he was back to getting what everyone else gets, and that was very nice for him.

review/summary: mmm....paste...
review/text: HORRIBLE!<br /><br />Package said cook 5-7 minutes. Set the timer for 6 and promptly drained the pasta. Many of the spirals had broken down into...lumps. But, I stupidly figured it would be fine with sauce on it. It tasted like paste. Or, maybe envelope glue. Either way it was awful. Nobody would touch it. Thank goodness for take out Mexican food, I guess. Entire dinner went in the garbage.

review/summary: Veri Peri ~ Great as a Chicken & Veggie Marinade!
review/text: Absolutely love the lemon & herb VERI PERI sauce.  Marinated a bunch of chicken thighs and sauteed a mixed vegetable medley of zucchini, summer squash, onion, garlic and mushroom to go with it.  Love this sauce!  It's so flavorful.  You can use it as a marinade, as a sauce in your skillet or work, it's even great as a condiment (dip).  Try it...you'll like it!!

review/summary: Veri good stuff
review/text: I used to live in Africa and "discovered" Veri Peri on a visit to South Africa and brought some home. I was delighted to find it on Amazon.com now I'm living back in the States. However, I didn't know it came in flavors (or flavours, if you prefer). I'm looking forward to trying the garlic and the lemon & herb.

review/summary: Makin Chicken and Things Go Bang!!
review/text: I tried Veri Peri for the first a few weeks ago and I must say that I was very impressed with this sauce/marinade. I have since tried them all (including the Veri Hot which is not for the faint of heart) and I love them all, but I will just talk about the Lemon and Herb here. The first thing I noticed about this sauce is how many different ways you can use it. It works wonders as a marinade or you can saute with it, or use it to replace other spices and herbs you might have otherwise used. I seem to find this flavor to work best with chicken and fish but don't let my amateur opinion stifle your creativity. I love the taste of this sauce, the lemon is just strong enough to give that little bite I love in a lemon and herb sauce and there are so many more flavors waiting to jump out at you from the South African herbs. This is definitely a must try for anyone who is serious about exploring new wonderful ways to prepare food. I recommend it to everyone and I always use Veri Peri when I want my food to impress.

review/summary: Huge taste in a small bottle
review/text: I'm a Manhatten and old fashioned freak; best cocktails on the planet if made right. And Fee's Whiskey Barrel Aged Bitters are just about the best tasting bitters that I've, well, ever tasted...period. Use Maker's Mark or a high-end rye whiskey with Fee's (and a really good vermouth)and you'll have yourself a supremely tasty drink, my friends. My best advice is to drink alone --like all true Vikings do--and you won't have to share with anyone else.<br /><br />Nothing worse than lipstick on a glass anyway...

review/summary: Favorite bitters out there
review/text: I decided to try these on a whim when I saw them at The Spuyten Duyvel Beer Shop in Williamsurg about a year ago. I have been a convert ever since! In fact, my usage of bitters has even gone up CONSIDERABLY since I started using them since I like them so much! They fall along the angostura lines, but have a distinctive richness and complexity. I've used them ever since and am about to pick up multiple bottles since I hate running out!
