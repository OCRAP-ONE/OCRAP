review/text: I recieved one of these bars in my Influenster voxbox and I love it! I warmed it up in the microwave for a few seconds and when I took it out the smell of it was amazing,a little on the nutty side and it was super soft. Went well with my morning coffee. It is a little on the sweet size but the bar itself is rather small. I do plan on purchasing a box of these in the future.

This is perfect for breakfast on the go for people like me who end up eating on their commute or for an afternoon snack. It's sweet enough to satisfy a sweet tooth, it reminds me of a healthier version of toaster strudel. The best part is that is contains protein, B vitamins and fiber. I can't wait to try the cinnamon pecan!

review/text: I recently received a sample through Influenster and really enjoyed it.  The one that I received is 1.48 oz and 140 calories. It is absolutely delicious. It's super soft but also has crunchy bits like a health bar. The banana nut flavor is prominent. It suggests warming it up on the package and I'm sure that is delicious, but after the first little bite, I kept on eating till my bar was gone, so I didn't get a chance to try it warmed up. I'll keep my eye out for it in the stores to get me a couple boxes and let the whole family try it.

You can eat it on the go. It tastes great and it's a better snack to eat than most items you'll find in a vending machine. I will be buying a box of these in the future.

review/summary: Dairy free, and remember to heat for 10 seconds!
review/text: A little over six weeks ago, I realized I was allergic to dairy and soon realized how many of my granola bar favorites were loaded with milk products. After going through gnu bars, macrobars, probars, trader joe's bars, barbara's, I was getting really disappointed with granola bar selections. Luckily, I was able to receive a free sample as part of my Influenster Summer Voxbox for review purposes.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that the Quaker Banana Nut Bread flavor is DELICIOUS and dairy free, completely bucking the trend. I followed the serving instructions and heated it for like 10 seconds before running out the door...so good and not gooey at all like I was expecting. When I go off to school next year, these will be a breakfast staple for sure!

review/text: I received a sample of this product for a "try and tell" program. This is a pre-made food, so of course it does not taste like homemade. That said, it is ok. It does have 5 grams of fiber in it, which is nice. So it is a nice and convenient snack if you are trying to watch your weight and boost your fiber. Banana nut isn't really my favorite flavor. I think I would like it better if it came in cinnamon apple.

review/text: I have just discovered this coffee and I am all in on this trio. I do not even know where to begin. I liked all three of the flavors, as each had its own personality and taste. I was not a fan of hazelnut until I tried the Vanilla hazelnut flavor, now I am hooked. I could taste the subtle vanilla flavor and the Hazelnut was not too overwhelming. I really liked the Chocolate Caramel Brownie and the Toasted Southern Pecan, these flavors really made my mouth happy. None of the flavors left an aftertaste, none of the coffees were bitter or acidic. I have not done it yet, I am going to try each of the coffees as an iced coffee treat as this is how much I enjoyed the coffee. I feel the cooffee can stand up to being iced, the flavors are that good,not too strong, not too weak, full flavored enough to be iced. Take advantage of the subscribe and save, if you try this coffee treat trio, I am sure you will not be sorry you did.Yes I recommend this if you are looking for a good quality coffe and a change from the same ole same ole.

review/summary: The BEST Yerba Mate Hands Down
review/text: There is no better Yerba Mate on the market. I have tried hundreds of brands and the quality just does not compare to Guayaki. I really like how they include stems with leaf. Mate is meant to be drunk this way and the stems add a significant amount of theophylline and theobromine and also add to the sweet and nutty flavor notes not found in other Mate's. I also appreciate that Guayaki uses only shade grown Mate - as it is meant to be. Sun grown mate lacks body and benefits.<br /><br />I really like the companies sustainable business model. The company is true blue when it comes to their mission. Fairly traded products that allow the indigenous people to receive a fair wage for their work. Guayaki's reforestation efforts should be applauded.<br /><br />Thank you for making such a fine product.

review/summary: Magic Potion from South America.
review/text: Mate is actually not tea but a tea-like beverage originating from Argentina and Uruguay, and primarily consumed in those countries as well as in Paraguay and southern Brazil; brewed from the dried leaves and stemlets of the perennial Yerba Mate tree. Its name derives from the quichua word "mati" designating the gourd in which it is traditionally served.  On average, 300,000 tons of Mate are produced each year.<br /><br />In its consistency similar to green tea, mate has a distinctive, full, bittersweet flavor with a note of alfalfa, resembling that of tea but milder. Of the 196 volatile chemical compounds contained in Yerba Mate, 144 are also contained in tea.  Knowing its manifold health benefits - among the plant's ingredients are the alkaloids xanthine, theophylline and theobromine as well as vitamins C, E, several B vitamins and numerous minerals - the South American Guarani Indians have traditionally used the plant for medicinal purposes, inter alia as a stimulant to the central nervous system, to promote mental, physical and cardiovascular activity, enhance resistance to fatigue, reduce fever, mitigate thirst and hunger, decrease blood pressure, and as a diuretic, laxative, purgative, sudorific, and antirheumatic.<br /><br />Legend has it that knowledge of the infusion's powers was first imparted to a young Guarani woman and her father by a mysterious shaman, rewarding the woman's faithfulness in staying with her exhausted father while her tribe continued their search for arable land.  In recent years, mate has become a cultural phenomenon throughout large parts of South America, and it is now gaining increased popularity in Northern America and Europe as well.  In South America, sharing mate from the same container and the same straw (bombilla) is a symbol of closeness and friendship, both in a family and in other social contexts.

review/summary: Stop! Don't buy it!
review/text: If you are a traditional Yerba mat&eacute; afficionado that uses a bombilla (filtered straw), this stuff is completely undrinkable. The mat&eacute; has been pulverized rather than cut and subsequently blocks the filter and clogs the bombilla. This creates two problems: First, you get precious little tea passing through and secondly, you must spend a good deal of time cleaning the bombilla out before it will be an efficient filter again.<br /><br />Incidentally, unbiased research shows that drinking the loose tea with a bombilla delivers much higher levels of polyphenol antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.<br /><br />Lastly, I have been drinking Yerba mat&eacute; for 22 years and there are plenty of other brands that have better flavor.

review/text: The tea I recived is about 50% woodie stuff (little sticks) and 50% green stuff.<br /><br />The shipping was nearly the same price as the Tea, so I ended up paying $15.70 for 1/2 pound of Yerba Mate!!<br /><br />After recieving the order, I got smart and googled Yerba Mate, and found lots of sites that offer a lot more tea for a lot less money, like $3.00/lb instead of the $30.00/lb that I paid.  Also, some sites that offer genuine Argentinean brands,  I think I'll try them next.

review/text: Guayaki's Yerba Mate is a naturally caffeinated elixir from the rainforest. One could call it an Argentinian Breakfast Tea,an Earl Grey of the Amazon. It has a smoky flavor. Guayaki contributes to rainforest preservation,adding a noble cause to their delicious tea. Yerba Mate is a perfect accompaniment to any meal, especially breakfast. Guayaki's rainforest-themed cafe in Sebastopol is a comforting getaway,complete with a comforting,energizing tea. Enjoy a cuppa of yerba mate!

review/summary: Good Halloween candy
review/text: You need to be careful of the source as the quality depends a lot on the shipper.  I usually order these by the mini-case.  Shippers will not guaratee against breakage if you order single boxes.  Mini-cases usually have special packing (I order from Bulk Foods and have never had trouble with breakage).  The better shippers will also ship with blue ice packs for an added charge (the blue ice packs can be reused).  Prices vary depending on the source.  Ordering by the mini-case, you can usually get a discounted price and free shipping, but you have to check around among the sources.<br /><br />The candy sticks themselves are the best variety that I have found.  The individual wrappers are all marked with the flavors.  Flavors are comparable with candy sticks from other manufacturers.  You can order specific flavors (orange, bubble gum, cotton candy, etc., depending on the source).  Orange is a good color for Halloween, or you can order red (cherry) and green (lime) for Christmas colors, or possibly the barber pole peppermint sticks.<br /><br />A mini-case may sound like a lot, but friends can combine orders.  Personally, I had about 400 trick or treaters last Halloween, and two sticks per child gives them a little variety and makes a good treat.  I ordered a mini-case of 12 boxes, gave one box to a merchant friend for her store, and had a few left for Christmas (they are colorful and can be used in stockings, gift bags, or added as ornaments to wrappings).

review/text: This is the worst honey I have ever tried. I bought it based on 2 excellent reviews here but I don't understand how anyone could have given this product more than 1 star. Not even sure this is real honey. Unlike real honey, this one is very runny... but that would not bother me too much. The problem is the "taste" of this. Imagine glue mixed with cigarette ash and sugar... that's what this tastes like. Sadly, I bought 3 bottles with s&s... not sure what I'll do with it, I feel bad donating something so foul tasting to the food bank...<br />Do yourself a favor and order real honey... this sewage is only good for pouring down the sewer... yuck!

review/summary: Good, easy stout along with a few additional ingredients
review/text: First, let me throw this caveat out there: I have not tasted the finished product yet, but based on the taste at bottling, I have no problems recomending this product. I added this can of HME after boiling 2 lbs of dark DME and 1 lb of light brown sugar. I left it in the primary fermenter for 3 weeks. Normally I only do a 2 week fermentation, but I gave this an extra week because of the adjunct sugar. The taste at bottling was a typical roasty bitterness associated with stouts. The coffee-like bitterness lingered at the end. I can't wait to try a small bottle of this in a month or so. The rest will wait for St. Patrick's Day.<br /><br />Starting out with HME is the easiest way to make good beer and this is a quality product to do so with.

review/summary: Spoiled
review/text: I unpacked the box of Old Wisconsin turkey snack bite sausage pieces and put the separate packages on my pantry shelf and kept one out to open and my mouth was watering.  After the first package was consumed I took another package of them out of the pantry and started in on it.  Wasn't too much later in the following week I noticed a pretty unpleasant smell in the pantry.  I thought for sure a rodent had got trapped somehow and probably died and was slowly rotting somewhere I could not see nor could I find anything of the sort.  The smell lasted and I scratched my head and wondered if the dead thing would eventually just dry up. Pretty soon my whole place smelled like the county landfill on a busy day. Well, it wasn't too long I went to grab another bag of the turkey sausage and gosh I found out the hard way where the small was emanating from all this time.  The bag of sausage I had just picked up was all rotted inside and it was totally putrid.  It was totally disgusting and it made my stomach feel a tad queasy.  I took the bag out and placed it in my garbage can and now I just can't wait till the City of Oswego KS comes and empties that can at the landfill. I have had my fill of this stuff! I doubt I will ever buy sausages from this company again!

review/summary: Turkey, Turkey Everywhere
review/text: My turkey sauage bites arrived before time and in great condition.But, because of the bad reviews, I opened all 6 packages to check them out--perfect.  Now, what to do with 6-8oz packes of sauage!  I put a covered dish by my computer and another by my viewing chair.  I made a variety of flavors out of the rest in 4oz wide mouth ball jars---one with bay leave and heated pickle juice; whole peppercorns and hot peppers; mixed with sundried tomatoes packed in grapeseed oil and capers; slice some to go on pizzas, salads, popcorn and made a great spicy dip with garlic and red onions.  Can't wait for my next shipment!!

review/text: The perfect low carb snack with just the right amount of crunch and spice.  I really like these little meaty pieces.<br />I keep mine in the freezer and just take a package out when needed, so have never had to worry about the mold that some pple talk about.  I find they keep for a long time once opened as long as I keep them in the fridge.<br />They are just yummy

review/text: I started a high protien diet and started buying these as snacks whenever I got hungry... now I am addicted to them.  Very tasty and a pleasing texture when you bite into them.  These are helping, because I've lost 20 lbs since starting my protien diet.  Will continue to make these part of our normal snack regiment.

review/summary: Great Taste, Low Fat
review/text: We got the Turkey and we really like it. There are only 1.5 grams of saturated fat in 6 bite size pieces and zero trans fat, less than 1 carb plus 7 grams of protein.<br />Refrigerate after opening, makes a good low carb snack, I take with me on mountain bike rides for protein.<br /><br />The taste is mild with no strong aftertaste, I wish the expiration dates were further out however. We ordered in January and received the product in January with an expiration date of August. We order no more than we will use in about 6 or 7 months.<br /><br />Altogether the turkey is a good product and handy snack. I would give 5 stars if the shelf life expiration dates were a bit further out.

review/summary: Tasty, Shelf-Stable Snacks
review/text: My family and I really like these snacks. Yes, they are processed food and not the healthiest thing to eat, but they are a good quick snack that tastes good and is a bit healthier than the beef and/or pork options out there. I like the fact that they are shelf stable, so we can grab a bag to take with us in case we don't have any other food options (travelling, etc.), and that is the main reason we buy them.<br /><br />We have noticed that these are packaged under a few different brand names, but I can't always find them locally. The price here on Amazon is competitive with our local retailers, so we buy these here when we run out and cannot find them elsewhere.

review/summary: Great at first, but HUGE mold problem.
review/text: Sure, they tasted great at first, and I was happy to order my kids a healthy meat snack without all those artifical cancer causing ingredients.  Problem is, that after a short period of time (way before the expiration date), half the packages molded disgustingly inside.  We have a completely air conditioned house, they were stored in a cool pantry that is mostly kept dark.  Reading the other reviews, I know I am not the only one with this problem.  Something is wrong with the packaging process, or the cooking process, but these rot fast UNOPENED.  Don't bother with this, find another product and don't waste your money =/

review/text: These are a great meaty snack to keep at your desk.  They've got a great smoky flavor and a velvety texture, and the casing has just the right amount of pop.  They also stay delicious at room temperature for... well for as long as you can resist eating them, which for me is only a few weeks even for the humongo package I always order.<br /><br />If there's any negative at all for this product, it's that you absolutely do not want to keep a bag in your car during the California summer.  That was kind of scary.<br /><br />So keep it indoors, and enjoy!

review/summary: Delicious, bite sized treats!
review/text: I originally bought these to give my dogs as a nightly treat. When they arrived, I popped one in my mouth to see what they were like, and WOW, it was like this taste explosion of grease and flavor. YUM. These are EXACTLY how pepperoni should taste. Firm skin, softer inside, with that little squirt of grease. My husband then tasted it and he completely agreed. Out of the six packages, he took five and I was left with one for the dogs.<br /><br />As human treats, these are fantastic. But as dog treats, not so much. Each package is 8 ounces, which is a LOT of pepperoni. I opened the packages, put it into an OXO pop container (air tight), and within 2-3 days of being inside the container, it started to form white, fluffy mold. Gross. I threw it out and figured it was a coincidence. I ordered some more, and did the same with a new package. Same thing happened - mold. If you are planning to eat these, it seems the quicker you consume these, the better.<br /><br />With how delicious they are, it shouldn't be tough! Our entire family loves these!

review/summary: Great candy substitute
review/text: I first bought these because I wanted a replacement for the candy bars I found myself eating every afternoon. These have worked so well for that purpose that I have subscribed to get them delivered regularly. Since they don't need to be refrigerated until opened, I can store them at my desk. They taste great, and they're very satisfying. I also brought a bag along to a weekend softball tournament, and it was very helpful to snack on them between innings.

review/summary: In the search for affordable turkey jerky, this was dissapointing
review/text: Wisconsin Turkey Snack bites, I'm sorry for the low rating<br /><br />But,<br />I was pretty disappointed.  It might taste good to some, but not me. I've so far had one other brand on amazon, and a few brands in store, and I disliked this one.<br /><br />The snack bites have a few problems.<br /><br />1) They're fairly watery. Not only do they look more "reconstituted" than other brands, but their water content seems higher.<br /><br />2) they're lacking flavor.<br /><br />I try to solve problem one and two, by cutting them in half, dosing them in some hotsauce pepper mix, and drying them in the sun [and once in the oven]. This is rather time consuming, sort of. But even then, the oil/protein ratio is higher (meaning more oil) it seems than other turkey snacks.  Which is lame.<br /><br />So, I'll keep looking for good turkey jerky on amazon [which is basically anywhere, since beef is the game in most stores], any suggestions in the comments I'd appreciate. Preferably at a reasonable cost.<br /><br />P.S, of humerus note, I noticed one of the suggested tags are "Hip Hop".  Funny.<br /><br />UPDATE: I got a comment that pointed out how this is not turkey jerky, but rather turkey sausage. This invalidates much of my review. I dont remember why I originally expected it to be more like turkey jerky. That said, they still were not tasty..

review/text: This tray makes a perfect monkey platter for a toddler! Before purchasing this I was putting items directly onto my son's booster tray or using several small dishes, but this is a way better solution. There are seven deep wells, perfectly toddler-sized. I can put a few heaping spoonfuls of yogurt in one, some brown rice in another, diced squash, some chopped apple, steamed spinach.. a bit of this and a bit of that. The monkey platter approach is a great way to encourage small children to try a wide variety of foods without overwhelming them and this tray is PERFECT. It's also cute and easy to clean.

review/summary: Works, but expensive
review/text: Basically my title sums it up.  This works, so I like it, but I really wish it wasn't so expensive.  Something that also works are ice cube trays (if you don't have the ones with lids you can put them into a large baggie before putting in freezer or cover with aluminum foil) and spray the tray with Pam before filling.  It really does make it so that the frozen food pops right out.  The one nice thing about this tray over ice cube trays is that it freezes bigger cubes, but right now my baby only eats a little bit so smaller portions/cubes are actually better for now.
