review/text: I bought and used this product and it was satisfactory in every sense except that when I went back to buy more, the copy said:<br />"Ground in a frozen state to preserve the shape of the flakes." Didn't go further. No Seller Contact was evident on the page. Too unappetizing.

review/summary: No miracle in a pouch, but kids love it.
review/text: We all know by now that eating a balanced diet leads to a over all better quality of living. Will this product be the end all fix for tricking your kids to get the proper amount of veggies a day. No way, but that doesn't make it a bad product, just not a miracle in a pouch. Each pouch is one combined serving of fruit and vegetable. That doesn't mean one serving of veggies and than one fruit but only one serving made up of both. The taste isn't bad at all. My kids inhale them as soon as I ration out their daily allowance. I noticed the amount of sugar in these and only allow one a day. My kids would love to drink these all day long if allowed. They pass the kid taste test approval. I subtracted the 5th star and only give a 4 because of the amount of sugar to volume, and that the juice is not 100% juice. I would love to see a Super-V drink with 100% juice and not the 66% it currently has. The Berry is the best tasting one in my opinion, but since we also buy apple, and fruit punch Super-V I notice they all go just as fast when offered to the kids.

review/summary: Very Good!
review/text: I discovered this product when I bought a fresh-made sandwich from a grocery store deli.  I asked the clerk what kind of sauce they used for that particular sandwich and she showed me the bottle, Heinz Southwest Style Chipotle Sauce!  Right away I checked out the condiment aisle. The sauce was not for sale there.  I went from store to store looking for this sauce and could not find it anywhere, so I got permission from the store manager to buy it from the deli department, even though it was not available for retail sale.  When the store changed sauces (dumb idea), I didn't know what to do.  I emailed Heinz and begged, but they said it's only sold to restaurants.  All I could find were these small cups, but it actually tastes better to me when it's not refrigerated, so these work out great.  I thought 100 would be way too many, but my friends and neighbors were intrigued, and took some home.  I also brought some to work and let my co-workers try it.  Everyone loved it!  Very unique flavor, tastes great on almost anything!

review/text: It's recommended as a dipping sauce, however, if you like Subway's chipotle sauce on your sandwich, you have to purchase this!  Personally, it's the best sandwich sauce around.  Very hard to find, this (Amazon.com) is the only store I could find to purchase.<br /><br />Doesn't take much sauce to taste - robust, slightly spicy flavor.  From what I understand, this is what most sandwich shops use - the best!

review/text: I can't believe the last guy's review! all of Mrs. Leepers pasta meals are EXCELLENT!! They do not taste gluten free at all! I think there was some speculation about the company lying about their finances or something, got some bad publicity. Then WholeFoods seemed to stop selling it! I was so disappointed- Even if you use the powder seasoning from other brands with your own GF pasta, you still risk eating gluten from the powder mix. Plus, the other brands taste nothing like Mrs. Leepers cheeseburger mac recipe.<br /><br />5/5 Stars. I'm def. buying a bulk pack!

review/text: I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease about 3 years ago and I LOVED finding GF boxed meals that taste like the ones I grew up on! It was absolutely delicious! BUT later that night I got really sick!  After mulling over the ingredients on the box I realized it contains "autolyzed yeast extract" which is a "natural" form of MSG.  I'm CRAZY sensitive to MSG which means I can't buy this anymore :( but to anyone without that sensitivity, you won't regret buying Mrs. Leepers! :)

review/summary: Convenient but Bland
review/text: This simple boxed dinner, a Hamburger Helper for the celiac disease market, has one major virtue and one major flaw: it doesn't taste gluten-free.  But it also doesn't taste like much of anything at all.  It cooks up quickly and easily, and the noodles have a soft texture and mild flavor very different from most GF foods.  But the cheese sauce has an airy "Cheez Flavr" that leaves no significant impression on my taste buds.  Because of the cooking speed, and the fact that one box with a veggie side dish could feed four, I give it five stars for convenience.  But its utterly forgettable taste and undistinguished character only merit two.  I split the difference.

review/text: These ears are HUGE!  They are not greasy and you get a lot of ear for the money.  I have three large dogs, one of which is older and missing some teeth.  This ear lasts her a LONG time, and it takes the other dogs, who have perfectly fine teeth, at least 45-60 minutes to chew one of these to smithereens.  I really appreciate the dryness of these; I hate the feel and odor of greasy pig ears.

review/summary: Not greasy or smelly
review/text: I bought these from my local specialty pet store for a dollar more than they're listed on Amazon, and I was glad to pay that price for them. I am excited to find them here at this price, because these were reserved for occasional chewies for my two dogs: an Italian Greyhound and a Pug. My dogs are moderate chewers and these pig ears will last them for at least a week. I give them the pig ears when I leave for school in the morning and even if I am gone for 8 hours or so, they still only make a small dent in it because these are so massive. Then I pick them up and return them to my dogs when I leave the house again. :) And, they do not leave any residue or smell behind, which is awesome because my Italian Greyhound likes to eat his on the couch. I though I was done dealing with pork chews because of the high fat contents of other pig ears and pork chews, but then I came across these and felt the dry, clean texture. At this price, these will become a more regular chew in their chewy repertoire. Merrick makes great products that are made in the USA with all USA sources, which is what I look for when buying my dogs any treats, from biscuits to chews. Even if you have a small dog under 20 lbs, I would recommend trying them, because they  are a great value and dogs can just work on a little bit at a time. I have been able to break them up before (usually a corner will be easier to snap off).

review/text: First off, this thing was HUGE.  It would be good for a Great Dane, but that is about it.  I was able to actually cut a small piece off (which took about 20 minutes to hack through the softest part), but my dog was able to chew through it and it came apart in chunks.  It was too dangerous for her to even eat, I was afraid she would choke on it, she is a small Yorkie.<br /><br />The other thing is the ear STUNK.  Whatever smoke stuff they put on it, got everywhere.  I guess if you have a really large dog and give it to them outside, this would be a good product.  But it just didn't work for me.

review/text: I have a Great Dane and two Dachshunds.<br /><br />Pros: My dogs loved these! They last a lot longer than Merrick Pig Snozzles. My Great Dane takes about 10-20 minutes to finish and my Dachshunds take as long as a few hours. Usually they don't get the option to finish because when my Dane finishes his, he goes after theirs.<br /><br />Cons: Expensive. I'm glad I tried them, but I wouldn't get them again. Too expensive for a treat that doesn't last that long.<br /><br />I'm giving them a high rating because my dogs thoroughly enjoyed them, but I don't think I would recommend them to somebody who doesn't want to spend a fortune on dog treats.

review/text: I first discovered Pasta Roni when I was a recent college grad with negative money, and after several years this variety is still something that I buy regularly because it's really easy to make and ridiculously tasty. The cheesy flavor is nice and sharp (and it's even better if you sprinkle in a little Parmesan) and the texture is smooth and creamy, even when I make it with skim milk. If you feel like getting fancy it tastes good with peas/broccoli/chicken/tuna in it, but really, it's delicious enough to enjoy on its own. And Amazon's 12-pack is a great deal: it shakes out to about $1.12 per box, which is over 50 cents less than what it costs at my local grocery store. Couldn't ask for much more from such a super-tasty, easy-to-make comfort food.

The flavor is really good, creamy, and easily one of our favorites, even if we are trying to stay away from too many processed foods.

review/summary: Better than restaurant's pasta!!!
review/text: I've been fixing this for so long now and it is easily my favorite meal! I add chicken, beef, or shrimp (or sometimes all 3) and it's absolutely delicious. It's actually quite nutritious and I prefer it over any restaurant pasta and I live in New York City! I used to buy it at Walmart where it is only $1, but it's so much trouble to go to New Jersey to the closest one so Amazon's price isn't too bad at all. Buy it, add your own touches, and enjoy!

review/summary: tootsie roll aren't what they used to be!
review/text: i bought these thinking they weren't as giant as they were and gave most of them away. i suppose because of the fact that corn syrup is used now instead of sugar is why they WILT...but tootsie rolls don't have the charm they used to have for me. I probably won't purchase them again.

review/summary: Choking on ginger...
review/text: I know that many people loathe the taste of ginger and thus hate ginger ale (a soda that doesn't really reflect the actual peppery-nature of ginger root) but I've always loved both, despite the fact that their relation seems to be in name only.  Maybe the reason I love ginger (as a spice) is because it adds some ethnicity to a dish, instantly taking it away from `bland' and into `flavor'.  Maybe the reasons I love ginger ale is because it doesn't taste like ginger.  That is the biggest misstep with oogave's Agave Ginger Ale.  The aroma alone is almost off-putting, the rich ginger smell emanating from the open bottle.  The taste though, that is the kicker.  The ginger flavor is so thick, and the spicy tingle at the back of your throat; it's just not refreshing.  When I drink a soda, I want it to be a cleansing and refreshing feeling.  oogave's Agave Ginger Ale is far too savory for its own good.  A direct ginger flavor is the makings of Chai Tea, not soda pop.  Still, I love this company and their other products (far more appealing flavor profiles).  Sadly, this ginger ale lover was turned off by the one product he was most looking forward to trying.<br /><br />:-(

review/text: I guess I was looking for steak and cheese spring rolls but these did not have any cheese flavoring.  Instead, they applied this awful sauce that ruined the whole roll.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was tender and delicious but as a complete package....goodness that sauce ruined the whole taste experience.

review/summary: My favorite sugar
review/text: I love a relaxing ritual. Here's one (but it's on the back shelf in this hot summer Southern heat until winter). Make a pot of favorite black tea. Place on a tray. Add your favorite tea cup and saucer and spoon. Bring out a favorite cream pitcher and sugar bowl. Carry to the fireplace and set upon a little table snuggled next to a comfy chair with a favorite self-sewn lap quilt and book all ready. Pour the tea and inhale its lovely aroma. Now pour a bit of cream and add a little spoon of Sugar-in-the-Raw for a special, almost hypnotic flavoring. Oh, how I love the granular flavor of this intense, yet gentle sugar. It's almost heady. Now, rel-a-a-x-x-x-x.....<br /><br />What is Sugar-in-the-Raw? Answer? A natural cane turbinado sugar from "where the tropical sun meets rich, fertile soil and cool mountain waters...." (box packaging). Where that soil meets the waters is unknown. The only location cited on the box is Brooklyn, New York. Ya think? Does it matter? Only if the consumer really wants to know. There is an address for inquiries cited with the Brooklyn location.<br /><br />What are possible uses for Sugar-in-the-Raw? According to information on the box, you can sprinkle it on fresh fruit, add to coffee, or sweeten cereal. I love its flavor best in hot tea and oatmeal. After you've cooked your oatmeal, shake out a spoonful of Sugar-in-the-Raw over the bubbly oatmeal. Lightly push a spoon through the mush and watch the sugar turn into lines of dark caramel-colored goodness.<br /><br />Sorry, but there's not much nutritional value in Sugar-in-the-Raw. Other values per teaspoon (one serving size) include Calories-15, carbohydrates-4g, and sugar-4g.<br /><br />But then there are flavor and taste. And these are why the consumer consumes this product!

review/summary: It Costs How?!? Much?
review/text: I nearly bought this as a birthday present for a friend who likes to "borrow" several packets every time he's in a restaurant/cafe. I was shocked to see a 32oz box priced over $12 on amazon - before adding $5 in shipping. I was even more shocked when I was at a local grocery store on Long Island, where prices are notoriously high, and saw the same 32oz box for $3.29. If you have a chance to buy this locally, please compare prices - yup, the sugar is great, but I can't think of any other product I've seen so marked up for online sales (I'm sure there are many, but bulk packed sugar...? Odd.)

review/summary: White colored sugar!
review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/text: I buy this by the quart, so obviously, I LOVE it!<br /><br />I used to use vanilla beans exclusively.  I found this through a cooking school class.  It is cheaper and easier than harvesting the seeds from vanilla beans, BUT you still get seeds in final product, and the taste is excellent--a triple win.  We now use it almost exclusively when vanilla is needed or wanted.  We've also begun spoiling ourselves by adding a bit to our coffee for vanilla latte.

It holds it's true intense vanilla flavor throughout.<br />I've tried many other vanilla flavorings but nothing holds a candle to this one.

review/summary: Where's that wonderful aroma?
review/text: I did my research before deciding to spend $30+ on a bottle of vanilla, granted a very large one. After reading all the comments, I expected the pleasant aroma of vanilla wafting from the bottle upon opening, but what I got instead was this murky, smokey smell that doesn't even remotely resemble vanilla. There is absolutely no vanilla aroma when I added it to my custards, even with additional amount. Sure, the vanilla specks are there, but what good would they do if they give nothing to the flavor of the dish? I must have gotten a bad bottle or something (is that even possible, for vanilla bean paste to go bad?). I'm quite disappointed, looks like I'll just have to stick with Costco vanilla extract from now on.

review/text: I have only been using these for a short time, but these seem to be good quality cooking chopsticks.  They are a bit thicker than other chopsticks (cooking or eating) which makes them easier to handle for cooking.  My only complaint is that these are advertised as 18" long, and the ones I received are 15-1/2".  The main reason I chose this product was because I wanted chopsticks as long as possible to reach safely into my deep cooking pot.  These are still usable, but I need to be careful since the missing 2-1/2" gives me less clearance over hot water than I was hoping for.

review/summary: Excellent Raw Cashews
review/text: After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged. Five pounds of cashews should be shipped in a proper box -- NOT a priority mail envelope!! I received my package punctured with a big hole, and there was a hole in the bags inside holding the cashews. Not sure how many cashews I lost in the delivery process, but doesn't look to have been too many. PLEASE Bayside Candy: package them better and I'll be a repeat customer and a 5-star rating!<br /><br />Other than the shipping snafu, the quality of these cashews are very good and are working very nicely in my raw food recipes.

review/summary: Packaged in Ziplock Baggies
review/text: Just a warning:  These Cashews came re-packaged in ziplock bags.  No safety seal or anything - just normal ziplocks.  I am not comfortable with that from a retailer, which may be coloring my impression that the nuts smell bad (though a friend smelled them and agreed).<br /><br />The seller will only refund me $1 unless I personally pay shipping to send the ziplock bags of nuts BACK to them, presumably to be resold. They were explicitly concerned about not being able to recoup costs if i did not return the product. They want me to bear the costs of their bad product instead.<br /><br /> Do NOT buy these - who knows how many times they send these nuts through the mail, have them returned, and resell them, with NO way to assure they have not been contaminated.  Very gross.  I plan to throw these away.  Sad.

review/summary: Yummy nuts!
review/text: I recently received these as a birthday gift to supplement my budding raw-foods diet. I was worried about buying bulk online, for fear they may be soft or stale. I am happy to report that neither fear materialized. These nuts were fresh and crunchy and very tasty. In fact, I had recently bought some at Whole Foods store and the Amazon ones were way better in comparison. I used the WF store ones for cashew milk and these bulk ones in my gogi berry trail mix. Yummy good. I recommend these bulk nuts!

The nuts arrived quickly, were fresh and delicious.  The nuts are almost all whole and there are very few broken nuts.  They were packaged in two sealed plastic bags which is very good as I can only eat so many and don't want them to get stale as they might if packaged in one big five pound bag.  The bags were in a box and very secure, no spillage or problem with the packaging of any kind.  I will definatly buy from this company again.

review/summary: Solved my sensitive cat tummy problem
review/text: I've tried a lot of "natural" cat food but still had one or more cats tossing their food fairly regularly (we have 5 cats).  I saw this in Whole Foods on special and gave it a try.  Well, a month later, not a single tosser since the switch and they love the taste.  Have had nothing but great response to the food.  It smells like real food, not revolting pet food, and the canned food, which I give occasionally as a treat, is also well received.  The canned food looks like canned stew for humans, though I wouldn't eat it, but it was impressive to me nonetheless. Reading the labels for this food shows it's all natural foods and supplements and none of the fillers or other byproducts that my cats are so reactive to.  Every animal is different, but this food solved, at least so far, all of my sensitive tummy issues.

review/summary: Loves the taste; Did Nothing for Sensitivities
review/text: I had read a lot of great reviews about this food. My kitty has had a lot of dry spots around her head that cause a lot of itching since I brought her home from the shelter. At first, I thought this had been related to the flea infestation she suffered from when originally brought to the shelter. When it did not go away after a few months, I decided to switch her food to something organic. Spot's Stew for Sensitive Cats in the seafood flavor was my first stop. Although Jemima loves the flavor, the dry spots on her head and neck region continue.<br /><br />This food does seem to have an appeal flavorwise. She started wanting to eat a lot more when I switched her to this. Clearly, she must love seafood more than a chicken and rice blend. With the exception of her skin still being excessively dry with the sore spots, her coat is gorgeous and she has not had any issues with throwing up.<br /><br />Jemima recommends this for organic snobs like herself.

review/summary: Great Taste......And Deal
review/text: I recently ordered a case of this for my fianc&eacute;e who is currently in southern Texas, where for some reason Progresso soups are available, but not this particular flavor.  She remembers it from way back and spoke about missing it a lot.  At first I thought I could save some money by just picking up a bunch of cans at the local market and mailing them myself.  But after checking the case price here on Amazon I decided to save myself a lot of trouble and packaging and send it to her directly.  I don't know what the price for a can of this goes for in your neck of the woods, but around these parts it goes for more than what the single can case price costs here on Amazon.  By adding a little something or other to the order I got free shipping making it an unbeatable deal.  The case arrived within a week, my fianc&eacute;e is deliciously happy, and I highly recommend this if you love this soup and can't find it where you are, or just love this soup and want it delivered by the case to you door... : )

review/text: When I bought this yogurt starter, I bought it in conjunction with the yogurt maker, which I have come to love.  The starter, on the other hand, I suggest using not as the box calls for.  Instead, you don't allow the milk to boil when you create the yogurt, and make sure that the yogurt culture is really dissolved when you mix it... I like the cultures okay, but I find that buying stonyfield plain organic yogurt and mixing a half a cup of that with the milk does the same thing.

review/summary: A Great Starter & Easy to Use
review/text: I've had the Euro Cuisine Yogurt Maker for well over a year now, but I'm just now trying out the starter the Euro Cuisine company offers.  While a little more expensive to use than six ounces of plain yogurt, it is easier to use.  As a bonus, this starter requires no refrigeration, so can sit around for awhile before use.  This is especially handy if you plan to use this starter as your back up starter, rather than as your primary starter.  The product comes with enough starter to make two batches.<br /><br />Use of this starter involves the boil method of yogurt preparation.  I've been using the boil method already, so this was an easy transition for me.  I discovered that the boiling point is lower with this starter than with  a plain yogurt starter and you don't have to cool the boiled milk down as far.  As a result, the prep time is shorter than when using plain yogurt.  The incubation period seems to be about the same.<br /><br />My first batch was perfect.  The yogurt is just a bit tarter than when made with a plain yogurt starter, but still quite good.  If you mix your finished yogurt with a little fresh fruit or a touch of fruit spread, the tartness isn't as noticable, but it depends on your preference.<br /><br />I love making and eating homemade yogurt.  The Euro Cuisine starter is a welcomed addition to my process.

review/summary: Best yogurt starter
review/text: I love homemade yogurt when made with this starter.  It is relatively foolproof with an inexpensive yogurt maker, and really delicious--much more delicate and fresh tasting than what you buy in the store.  It sets up well and provides a good base for added fruit and honey for a healthy, nutritious and satisfying breakfast or lunch.  One packet of starter is added to a batch of warmed milk, per your yogurt maker's directions, stirred and left for the required length of time--about 6 to 8 hours.  That's all there is to it.  The finished yogurt lasts well in the refrigerator and can also be drained through cheesecloth for a denser, Greek-style yogurt.  I'm told the quality of the yogurt depends on the starter and this is the only kind I'll use.
