review/summary: Lucky Country Licorice, Black Cherry 16 oz tubs (pack of 4)
review/text: Lucky Country Licorice, black cherry 16 oz tubs (pack of 4)... This candy is the best I have ever tasted, my last order was my third (3rd), it is realy good and may be habit forming to your tast buds.<br /><br />There are several items to choose from, which can be confusing. The best value is the 4-16oz tubs,4 lbs total vs the 1.5 pound package, they are both the same price. I found this to be wrong, on the part of Amazon to allow this to happen. I did not send the 1.5 lbs bag back, it wasn't worth my time, and I do like the candy...<br /><br />I live in Gainesville FL, not Zoe KY.

review/text: Yummy, chewy, filled with flavor in every bite.  I've also had the Green Apple and while good, not quite as satisfying.  The Black Cherry is devine!  The Cherry flavor pops with the first nibble; rich and full.  Now I need to try the other flavors.  Lucky Country is sometimes sold at Walmart (Black only) and used to be found at Costco....but is generally difficult to find.  Amazon has a great selection!

review/text: this candy was ok, but it had a different taste than the one we had previously bought at Costco, even though it was supposed to be the same flavor. But, the one in Costco said "new improved recipe" perhaps this one was the old recipe. I was disapointed. But the quality of the candy was fine. Just not the same as the one I already had. So, this candy is not being eaten any nearly as fast.This candy was a brighter red color, and not as soft. However, this candy did have a stronger strawberry flavor.

review/summary: Gourmet-Food
review/text: The cheese was delicious but my experience with the vendor, Gourmet-Foods was extraordinary. Amazon had told me that delivery was set for Wednesday (This is important because its cheese and if it can't be delivered there's a good chance it will go bad). Gourmet-Food sent it to me on a Saturday when I was out of town and could not be there to accept the delivery. There was no deliveries from Fed-ex on that Monday either which meant I'd be getting warm inedible cheese. Gourmet-Foods realized that Amazon screwed up by giving me a wrong delivery date and decided to send me a new, fresh piece of cheese at no charge. I find this level of customer service very rare these days and based on this I would highly recommend using them for any of your cheese purchases.<br />Harold L.

review/summary: Good stuff
review/text: Both the dog and the cat very much enjoyed this stuff. It's different sized pieces of dry, mildly smelly tripe- not near as disgustingly scented as other tripe products I've tried! I'm going to stick to this brand, though on the back of the package it says "100% beef LIVER" for some reason ? Tripe is supposed to be stomach/intestines I thought... It looks and smells like it's actual tripe, perhaps it's just a mis-label from the company. Keeps well, doesn't have to be refrigerated and was easier for me to handle than other kinds I've tried. I feed my animals a RMB diet and this is an essential part of it!

I knew from reviews how smelly tripe is so that isn't really a problem. The pieces are pretty dang big for my little boys though so I have to use scissors to cut them into small pieces. Not a huge deal, but useful to know if you are buying for small dogs.

review/summary: Smashed bits
review/text: Amazon sent this with one little airbag square floating on top like a silly decoration. So the crackers arrived smashed and in bits.<br /><br />In the same box were Triscuits and Wheat Thins. Those are sturdier crackers and they survived the bad packaging.<br /><br />I requested a replacement of the Better Cheddars, and asked that it be protected for shipping. Well, if you shop groceries here a lot, you can guess the outcome. Packaging about the same (with the minor variation that the top of package was decorated by a 4 small squares of deflated airbag). Crackers again in smashed bits.<br /><br />Amazon has the unit of six boxes of crackers, by the way, wrapped in a piece of plastic to seal them together, then affixed is one of those "Ready to Ship by Amazon" stickers. Almost always in the past products with that sticker are in their own box. Certainly needed here. Double-box would then give you whole crackers on arrival. Yet don't bet on any such change in the near future. :(<br /><br />So in the meantime, if you like these, I advise swinging by a B&M store to get them.

review/text: You must, of course, take the whole "protein cookie" aspect into consideration when tasting these treats.  They are soft and a bit dry, but with very satisfying chocolate chips to nibble on.<br /><br />Texture-wise, I prefer ON's Colossus Cookie (they are chewier and moister), but the ingredients list on Jay's is far better and less scary.  He is using a "real" cookie recipe with a bunch of protein powder added in.  They taste good enough that I wonder if the stats are too good to be true.... but from what I've heard he has a good reputation amongst the bodybuilding crowd.

review/summary: Decent if they are microwaved.
review/text: Alright, I have always been a fan of these "cookies" as well as Titan's brand of protein cookie. Recently they have changed their formula on the tri-o-plex cookie, adding 30 calories and giving the cookie the texture of very dry dirt. The only way I have found to make these cookies pleasurable to consume is to microwave then for about 15 or 20 seconds to soften them up. That being said, once you do the microwave trick, they are actually fairly decent.<br /><br />The Titan brand protein cookie is actually moist straight out of the box with only 300 total calories for 2 cookies, aka 150 each. The Tri-o-plex cookies are now 171 calories a pop. Overall, these are a good source of protein and in a convenient package you can toss in your car on the way to the gym.<br /><br />They are NOT energy bars, just protein bars and actually have a fairly small amount of non-alcohol type sugars, aka these aren't going to give you the boost of energy and sugar you might need if you are wanting to juice up before a work out. I would consider these a decent protein / post workout cookie. If you need some energy, get a glass of grape juice and throw 2 scoops of grape Jack3d in it.<br />USP Labs Jack3d, 250-gram Tub Ultra-concentrated Grape Bubblegum - Needs Only 4-8 Ounces of Water Per Serving!

review/summary: Falls short of expectations
review/text: I really like these high protein snacks.  The cookies are tasty but the quality varies quite a bit.  I've received 8 boxes now and I can safely say that no two boxes have been exactly the same.  Most recently, I received a box that contained cookies with only 18g of protein per pack, and they were definitely harder than previous shipmints.  Currently I get two boxes a month, basically one pack of cookies a day, but I will be going down to 1 and begin my hunt for something new and better.

review/summary: Great tasting protein cookies.
review/text: Now you can tell these taste different but they are really good.  I was having a problem cutting back with eating diet along with my weight training and sprint workouts.  Mainly due to my live in girlfriend that is a cookie monster.  So she has all kinds of goodies laying around the house.  When I got stressed, had a bad day, or just had a sweet tooth, I would dig in to her stuff.  It really set me back.  So I tried some of these.<br /><br />Golden.<br /><br />Good tasting and effective.  I am about to order another pack soon.

review/summary: Satisfying and large chocolate chips - YUM
review/text: The size of these cookies are pretty big and satisfying. At about 10g of protein for a cookie, thats pretty good. It satisfies your sweet tooth. They are slightly dry and have a little bit of grittiness similar to oats, but dont let the word "grittiness" scare you. It actually does taste real close to a good chocolate chip cookie. Its also got a lot of real large chocolate chips that are delicious. I also want to try their brownies - those look delicious.<br /><br />These are a great replacement for a snack, maybe instead of regular cookies or oreos. I usually only eat one of two in the package and feel satisfied. I dont feel like im sacrificing anything. I would recommend these. They are also all natural which is a plus. At vitamin shoppe they sell these things at $28/box. Amazon has the best deal (just make sure they dont melt in the mail and the expiration date hasnt passed which occasionally happens with food purchased from amazon.) With amazon's great return policy, theres no harm in giving it a shot.

review/summary: Just as good as regular cookies
review/text: These cookies taste great and have a good balance of protein, carbs and fats. I only wish they came wrapped individually (instead of having two cookies per package) in order to preserve freshness when only one cookie is consumed at a time (two cookies contain too many calories to be used as a snack, even though they might be ok as a meal replacement).

review/summary: Awesome!!
review/text: I had bought the Tri-O-Plex bars from the company when they were at the Arnold fitness Expo and loved them very much, so, when I saw the cookies here on Amazon, I thought I'd take a chance on them. They are absolutely delicious!! Granted, their calorie and sugar count are rather high, however, I use them as an after workout meal/snack replacement. Which made them fit into my daily plan very well.<br /><br />So often those of us working on our bodies run into the "saw dust" bars and snacks. Which after a while just makes us lose interest in supplements and eating better. Especially that very needed after workout boost. Tro-O-Plex gets it!<br /><br />...I hope they bring the cookies to the Expo this year!!

review/text: Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice Herbal Tea<br /><br />Is this for real? I read the box: no calories, no sodium, no sugar, no carbohydrates, caffeine free. This does not taste like any herbal tea I have had before.<br /><br />The cinnamon packs zing, the apple is sweet, and the chamomile provides the tongue appeal.  This is a full bodied tea, almost like drinking espresso.<br /><br />Without the caffeine.<br /><br />Delicious.  I had no idea that an herbal tea could be so satisfying.<br /><br />Like savoring the hard candy shell of a candy apple without the mess or the calories.<br /><br />Ingredients;<br /><br />Cinnamon - Yes, overwhelmingly.<br /><br />Hibiscus - That explains the sweetness.  When I lived in the Virgin Islands we would pluck hibiscus blooms and suck the nectar from the flowers' bases.<br /><br />Chamomile - The alkaline feel of the tea on my tongue comes from the chamomile.<br /><br />Roasted Chicory - Chicory, yes, that provides the full bodied, peppery sensation.<br /><br />Orange Peel - More zing!<br /><br />Roasted Carob - I can see how they layered this tea to give it so much weight.<br /><br />Natural Cinnamon and Apple Flavors and Natural Flavors - Okay, I'll admit that sounds like they added a drop of this flavored syrup and and drop of that.<br /><br />I don't care.<br /><br />This is great herbal tea.

review/text: I drink a lot of tea and I've tried many different brands and flavors. This is one of my most favorite teas. My only complaint is that the wonderful spice flavor it's quite strong enough for me. I love the smell of the spices; the cinnamon, cloves and other spices. The blend between the apple flavor and cinnamon and spices is about equal; no one over powers the others. Other brands I've tried are way more apple or no apple at all (depending on the brand) but none I've tried have the blend of spices, which I love in this tea. I really think liking the flavor of a tea is personal preference, but If you're a tea drinker I think this one is worth a try.

review/summary: This review is for the diabetics out there
review/text: I usually purchase this at my local store but I will be purchasing it here.  I have read several reviews, seems people love it or hate it. For those that dislike it, there seems to be a back and forth on too much apple vs. too much cinnamon or too bitter vs. too sweet. Like anything else, both are a matter of individual taste.  For those who found it too bitter (spicy), from my experience I have found that if you steep it (using boiling water) for 4 mins (remove the bag)in an 8 to 12oz cup it lessens the zing that the cinnamon packs. What is really nice for the diabetics out there is that the cinnamon helps with the glucose levels and this tea carries a bonus in that it is sweet.  I do not add sugar or sugar subs to my drinks so this tea is really a sweet treat for me.  Artificial sweeteners are really popular with many diabetics I know but they are not good for your health. So if you are looking for no caffeine sweet cinnamon tea, this is it. Hey, it is worth trying. The true motto for most diabetics.

review/text: At first sip, this tea was pleasantly sweet and abruptly becomes overwhelming with the sharp, dry taste of cinnamon. Holding the tea in your mouth for a few seconds and allowing the aromas to circulate through the mouth reduced the nasty aftertaste. Watering it down a bit and adding a few drops of honey reduced the potency, as well. The sharpness of the cinnamon is too much for this tea to really be enjoyed and the remaining sachets will likely be used to spice a few gallons of apple cider.

review/text: I figure it's better to be honest than let people buy unaware. So ...<br /><br />I wasn't sure I even liked this at first taste. I guess I should have expected it from the name but I was given a real harsh kick from the spice. It made my mouth just about numb. Second cup of tea I let steep just a smidge shorter time and added a dash of my favorite creamer. It cut back a little bit on the spice (still, was fairly spicy) but kept the full bodied flavor ... really brought out the apple - which I love. Overall, it's a great tea - just not something I'll drink everyday. It will be used as more of a special treat.<br /><br />Truthfully, if the most you could handle is a lightly spiced tea this probably isn't the tea for you unless you can really doctor it up.

review/text: I love this tea! Tasty with a zip in the mouth which reminds me of the Vimto I used to drink as a child.<br />I usually don't consume non Cert Organic things so I really wish they would make it with Organic ingredients, they are all available organically as far as I can tell. I contacted the maker & they said it's a non GMO product & that all their suppliers have to agree not to use GMO but I still do wonder.<br />I've been cold turkey for a few weeks now as I've moved & can't find the box with they in. I do miss them, is this healthy?

review/text: I was looking for Gingerbread spice tea because it tast's great and helps my digestive system but I couldn't find it in the local store's.  I did however find cinnamon apple spice so I thought I would give it a try. Wow!<br />I love the spicy flavor with a hint of apple.  It gives a warm comforting feeling.  It's great for cold winter evening and mornings. the only thing that I have a problum with is that it does bother my digestive system if I dringk very much of it very often. but thats OK because now I can buy the Gingerbread spice tea on Amazon and still have this one once in a while.

I noticed a big improvement in my skin when I drink this tea. I love the taste and smell of the spices too. I could never find another apple cinnamon spice tea like this one. Adding some honey will enchance the flavor if it's too blant for you.

review/text: I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter. When I opened the box, the smell was fantastic. I had such high hopes for this tea, but was sorely disappointed. It was much too sweet for me. I was expecting something that was heavily spiced, but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent.<br /><br />I didn't want it to go to waste, so I experimented, trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied. I tried steeping it for a short period of time, making iced tea, adding a splash of milk, adding more cinnamon, etc. Nothing seemed to do it for me. I really wanted to like this tea, because it smells so great, but I guess I'll be on the look-out for something else.

review/text: I got this tea thinking it would be a nice tea reminiscent of the kind of hot cider drink you might get from a coffee shop.  What I got was a rather unpleasant experience.  When I first opened the box at work, my co-workers said this tea smelled like the cinnamon chewing gum "Big Red".  When I got to the first sip I encountered the sweet flavor of the apples before I was quickly overwhelmed by the very bitter taste of cinnamon.  It felt like two siblings who were not on good terms with each other.  Face-scrunching ensued.  I will not be finishing this box.

review/summary: BOUGHT 2 BOXES, YES I AM A SHAMELESS ADDICT OF THESE!!!
review/text: I bought 2 boxes of these bars last Summer and must have gained 20 lbs. cos I only gave away a few.  These bars ARE SCRUMPTIOUS, something about toffee and milk chocolate just makes my mouth water, I like these more than Skor bars because the toffee tastes better, more buttery, sweeter and has a certain crunch to it that Skor bars don't.  Skor's chocolate tastes better cos it's a little darker but the toffee isn't nearly as good.  These things are INSANELY good, I honestly don't know if there are many other chocolate/toffee bars/candies out there, besides Heath, Skor, Almond Roca, Werther's Originals, Reisen's and the like, but there should be.  I can without these for a long time because the butter-to-sugar content of the toffee is so crazy high that I'm sure diabetes would be in my future if I didn't cut back on them.  A worthy gem of a candy.

review/summary: A tasty, gluten-free alternative to white rice
review/text: My wife and I both love white rice. But as we enter middle age and seek a healthier and more nutritious diet, we are aware of the pitfalls of processed/refined carbohydrates and their effects on blood sugar levels and post-meal hunger pangs. We've tried several brands of brown rice, but never found one that was a satisfying replacement for our white rice and potato cravings.<br /><br />I stumbled upon Bob's Red Mill Grain Countrywild rice at Amazon.com and decided to give it a try. The results exceeded our expectations. It's much more flavorful than brown rice, with a nice nutty body and texture from the mixed brown and wild rices. Although it takes a bit longer to cook than white rice (55 vs 35 minutes), the wait is worth it, and the almost "popcorn" smell emanating from the kitchen whets the appetite.

review/text: MAKING YOUR OWN GELATIN DESERTS<br />As the package advises, you can make "better Jello" with Knox Gelatin and fruit juice. This also gives you the opportunity to use the sweetener of your choice---or mixtures. Although I use Pure Stevia Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz in my coffee, I find that Spenda tastes better with sour fruit juices Splenda No Calorie Sweetener, Granulated, 1.2-Pound Bag. If you buy "store bought" juice---it usually has enough sugar in it for ordinary "jello", but if you add sour fruit, you need to oversweeten the gelatin. This is a great way to use sour fruit which is not appealing to eat "out of land", and a great way to get kids to eat fruit. Cold reduces the sensation of sweetness, so you need extra sweetener. Generally, I cube sour fruit and embed the fruit cubes in over-sweetened unflavored gelatin. A layer of mixed fruit and berries in sweetened gelatin above vanilla pudding in a champaigne glass is a very special desert---and can be both low-calorie and healthy.<br /><br />The basic Knox recipe, gelatin/cup water (or juice) produces firm gelatin, firmer than jello (following the instructions). You can make very firm "jigglers" for kids by doubling the gelatin. Use silicon candy molds to make shapes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VPW0V8">Freshware 30-Cavity Silicone Chocolate, Jelly and Candy Mold</a><br /><br />Be creative: You can make "iced tea" gelatin, or coffee gelatin. Sweet mint gelatin (made with fresh mint leaves) is very refreshing, a few embeded mint leaves and perhaps a few thin slices of strawberry can make it special. Almost any non-sparkling beverage can make great gelatin. Most adult "mixed drinks" can be gelled. Can you imagine serving "jello" to your guests at a fancy dinner party, and then they find that it is fabulous? Base your recipes on mixed drinks you like. Almond "jello" made with Amaretto, perhaps with shaved almond on top, is a nice surprise.<br /><br />OTHER DESERTS<br />You can add gelatin to almost any puddling-like desert (including pies served cold) to make it firmer and more healthy. I use Knox gelatin to make "chocolate" pudding with a tropical fruit called "black sapote". In such cases it is best to make a very strong gelatin and water (or juice, or milk) mixture, and add that to the other ingredients. If you try to mix the gelatin directly with the other ingredients, chances are that it won't dissolve property. The rule is "Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it." Don't overdo the gelatin, most of these deserts are best "thick creamy" rather than "chunky".<br /><br />WORKING WITH KNOX GELATIN<br />Individuals who are used to jello may find Knox Gelatin difficult to use. It isn't. The trick is simply TIME. Typically, I microwave 2 cups of fruit juice in a 4 cup measuring cup for 5 minutes---that gets it up to boiling or very near boiling. Then sprinkle a little gelatin on the surface and stir, repeat until you've added all the gelatin. At this point there will be many large globs of gelatin floating in the measuring cup. DON'T PANIC. Just give it a little time. Stir gently for several minutes, and you'll find most of the gelatin dissolved. If you don't have the patience for that, then take out the garbage or do some other 5 minute chore. After 5 minutes, you'll find that most of the remaining gelatin will dissolve with a little stirring.<br /><br />> Tempted to use a hand blender or cake mixer? Don't. Mostly, that just makes a mess to cleanup. However, I've found that a little mini-mixer works well and cleanup is easy Norpro Cordless Mini Mixer, 5 Piece Set.<br />> Tempted to add the gelatin to a (puddling etc.) mixture and then heat the mixture? Don't. In my experience it is very hard to get the gelatin to dissolve. Again: The rule is "Make the gelatin first, and then add 'stuff' to it."<br /><br />PREPARING FOR A COLONOSCOPY<br />Take a steak, cut into small strips, and then boil it to heck in 2-3 cups of water. Add a tablespoon or so of Braggs Aminos instead of salt. Bragg Liquid Amino - 32 oz - Liquid Strain. Discard the boiled meat (or use it for cat/dog food). Chill the liquid. Remove the solid layer of fat from the top. Walla!! "beef jello" (aka jellied consumme). Really! Gelatin is animal connective tissue---and there is lots of in a steak. "Beef jello" is surprisingly satisfying and filling, and will easily hold you overnight until the terrifying "event" is over. Obviously, beef jello is a terrific food for older folks who can't chew or have trouble swallowing. You can also drink it hot as a broth, however chilling and gelling has the advantage of separating out the fat (on the top) and the fine solids (as a layer on the bottom) which could interfere with your colonoscopy.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Knox Gelatin? The alternate (easier, faster) way to make "beef jello" is to dissolve gelatin in water and add bullion concentrate (beef bullion is the same thing as "boiled to heck and then strained" steak), and chill. Bullion is already salty, so you don't need the Braggs. Or you can make "chicken jello". If you are a vegetarian---well forget it---gelatin is an animal product, so just go with the beef or chicken "extract".<br /><br />SOUPS AND STEWS<br />Homemade broth from bones and scraps is the basis of great soup or stew, largely because of the "body" it adds to the soup. You can use Knox gelatin for the same purpose---to add body. The soup will remain watery while hot, but and the gelatin per se has no flavor, but you'll notice the "body". Make up a gelatin solution first, then add the soup ingredients. Homemade broth also has alot of dissolved proteins, which enhances the flavor---you can use bullion or Braggs for this purpose. Another important flavor component of good soup is fat. If you've chilled your broth and removed the animal fat, replace it with vegetable oil, ideally olive oil. I usually add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil to a pot of soup or stew. Most grocery store olive oil is harsh and bitter---but ironically, that adds complexity to soups and stews. Colavita is a better general purpose olive oil which can be found in some better grocery stores, which is also great on salads, and even for dipping. Colavita Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 34-Ounce Tins (Pack of 2).<br /><br />To repeat: the key to good soup, stew, bean dishes, chili, etc. is: 1) gelatin, 2) dissolved protein, and 3) fat (vegetable oil). You can get all these components by boiling meat scraps (including bones). But you can also assemble "broth" from the ingredients (gelatin, dissolved protein, and fat) if you don't have home-made broth on hand. Most people only think of making beef broth. However, I save every chicken bone (along with the giblets) and freeze them until I have several quarts, and then I boil them for 6 hours or more (with a little white vinegar) to make chicken broth.<br /><br />If you are one of those strange people who likes an occassional bowl of broth made from bullion cubes Herbox Beef Boullion Cube, 25-Cube Canister (Pack of 6)---next time add a packet of Knox gelatin.<br /><br />FOR HAIR AND JOINTS<br />20 years ago I was diagnoised with arthritis in my hip, confirmed by x-ray, and had begun to get aches in my shoulders, knees and elbows. I began taking 1 citracal tablet Citracal Maximum Caplets with Vitamin D, 180-Count Bottle and 1 glucosamine/chondroitin tablet daily Kirkland Signature Glucosamine HCI 1500mg Chondroitin Sulfate 1200mg 220 Tablets / New Increased Count. Now 20 years later, I'm a geezer without arthritis (or at least without symptoms). I also take a biotin suppliment for my skin and nails NOW Foods Biotin 5000mcg, 120 Vcaps. I've noticed a striking improvement of the "lizard skin" on my hands, and a softening of my brittle nails after eatting a cup of gelatine dessert daily for a couple of weeks<br /><br />VALUE<br />1 oz packages (of 4 envelopes) sell at my local Publix for $1.49 each.  1.49 x 12 = 17.88  (half the Amazon price)  Actual Jello or Royal Gelatin may be cheaper.
