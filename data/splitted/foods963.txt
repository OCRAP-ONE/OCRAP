review/text: I bought this product because the Legacy Farms product (Oat Bran) was shown as not available.  I was looking for the Legacy Farm product.  It seems to be the only one that is gluten free.  The Mulberry Lane Farm product was misleading in that it stated that oat bran is "naturally" gluten free.  The truth of this is, if it is "milled" in a plant that does not clean or dedicate the equipment to gluten free products, then it is not a gluten free product.<br /><br />Please bring back Legacy Farm Oat Bran. As a celiac disease person, I must have the totally gluten free product.<br />I had to give away the Mulberry Lane Farm.  I thought they and you (Amazon) were misleading.<br /><br />Therefore it is the poorest rating you have.  It makes me question buying from you again.<br /><br />Thanks for asking.

review/summary: Not Christmas without these Cookies!
review/text: I look forward to these cake-like ginger spice cookies at the start of every Christmas season. As to their authenticity, I lived near Munich (M&uuml;nchen) in Germany when a child over 35 years ago, and they are the exact same cookies we ate back then. They are the perfect mixture of sweet and spice; and lightly crunchy on the outside, spongy soft inside. No other brand or variation will suffice for me, not even the fully chocolate-coated version which -- while still very good -- throws off the delicate balance of flavors. A literal translation of "lebkuchen" is "life cakes", and once you've tried these confections you may understand why.<br /><br />They are hard to find in local stores. I've had reasonable luck finding them at Cost Plus World Market (usually ranging six to eight bucks per package), although they fly off the shelves fairly quickly with almost no chance of a reorder before Christmas.

review/summary: Addictively amazing - but not for the weak palate!
review/text: Soooo good.  Really spicy, mellowed out by the thin bittersweet chocolate.  Even when they are not at their freshest, they are completely edible.  Each bite is a complex experience.  First, the teeth break through the crystaline sugar top coat.  Then the firm yet yielding chocolate bottom layer is breached and finally, the moist cloud of spicy cake is released to the tongue.  It's a sublime dance of textures and flavors that can make the mouth seem like the most divine mixing bowl on Earth.  My taste buds are surprised anew with every bite.<br /><br />I can't comment on how authentic they are from a German perspective, but I search for these every year.  My local shop stopped carrying them, but here they are on Amazon.  Just take note:  if you are usually accustomed to Digestive Biscuits and Lorna Doones, these cookies will blow your wig back!

review/summary: NUTRITIONAL YEAST PROTEIN DOES A BODY GOOD!
review/text: I have been using NOW brand of Nutritional Yeast Powder for about 2 years now. Originally, an internet article claimed it enhanced the hair, skin and nails. Then, lo and behold, a friend told me they used it, so I gave it a try. I do find quality effects, especially with my skin. I also found it does not work instantly. It takes awhile to get into the human system. So, if you are looking for an instant cure, ain't gonna happen overnight!<br /><br />About the taste - yeah, it's funky! I disguise it by mixing it with wheat germ, ground flaxseed meal and (Optimum Nutrition) dark chocolate whey protein powder. This mix goes in my protein shake everyday and on my cereal 'mush', which is a combo of cooked steel cut oats and quinoa, enhanced by (my own mix of ) seeds and almonds, prunes, mashed banana, cayenne red pepper, turmeric and cinnamon. Mixing it either way, 'mush' or 'shake', kills the taste of the yeast powder.<br /><br />(Hint, if you're using cayenne red pepper or turmeric, or both, in a protein shake, you only need 1/16 of a teaspoon of each, or else!)

review/summary: Great cereal with lots of crunch and flavor
review/text: I usually do not like flake cereals because they get so soggy by the end of the bowl.  But this Special K, Vanilla Almond, does not get soggy like that at all and has nice crunch all the way to the bottom of the bowl.  It is also not so crunchy that it rubs the roof of your mouth raw.<br /><br />TASTE:  It also has a generous serving of actual toasted almonds in each serving, enough to notice and enjoy them.  They are slivered so they mix well with the flakes and stay distributed in the bowl for the most part, unlike chopped nuts that immediately sink to the bottom.  The vanilla flavor is there, but it does't overpower or taste of chemicals.<br /><br />DESCRIPTION:  I would describe this cereal as being a cross between granola and regular Special K, it is wonderful slightly crushed and mixed into plain yogurt and fruit -- lower cal and fat than granola, a great substitute.  I like it better than Honey Bunches of Oats because the crunchy bits are pressed onto the actual flakes and not just chunks mixed in with plain flakes, I think is why it stays crunchy in milk.<br /><br />VALUE:  The price here on amazon with S&S is the best I have seen.  I snack much less if I have this in the morning; I have a bowl of this with milk (Blue Diamond unsweetened almond milk or 2% cow's milk) and it keeps me full and happy for hours. I think the almonds give it more staying power than most flake cereals.<br /><br />FINAL WORD:  I subscribe to this product and would recommend it to anyone.

The almonds are not as plentiful as shown in the pictures but the taste is very good. As with most Special K cereal, it stays quite crunchy and holds up well in milk. Good value and great taste, 5 stars from me!

review/summary: Great Taste, Good Price!
review/text: I usually buy Special K cereal at Costco because of their great price. The only problem is that they only carry the strawberry one, and after a while it can get boring. At once point they introduced a variety pack that included peach I think, so that was good. But lately it's been strawberry, strawberry and more strawberry.<br /><br />Anyways, I came to Amazon to see if I could get a different flavor for the same price, and sure enough I can. The price per ounce for this specific one is right around Costco's price.<br /><br />It tastes really good too, though I've had complaints that it's a bit sweet (admittedly, it is sweeter than the strawberry version). The almonds are great, and add to a very interesting taste.<br /><br />Out of all of of the Special K cereal this is my favorite.

The problem is that so do others in my house so I decided to subscribe so that I would always have some on-hand without having to make a special trip out of the house.  I did a coupon search before my initial order and was able to get an additional discount.  The first order showed up the next day, which actually shocked me.  Subsequent orders have not shown up as quickly but I always have some handy when I want it.

review/text: This is the best candy I've ever eaten...I'm not a big fan of candy, but I love coconut and almonds, and this candy is wonderful.  Everyone I've given some to loves it as well.  I recommend it to anyone who likes coconut and almonds.  It's made in Belgium, so that explains why it's so good.

review/summary: Love it!
review/text: My first taste of Ferrero Rocher was when someone gave me an assorted gift set years ago. I don't particularly like chocolate sweets as I don't like the creamy fillings that come in them, but the chocolates looked pretty neat and the box was opened. Wouldn't you know it, but the one I liked most was the Ferrero Garden, the coconut flavored one, and the only one of the 3 that you couldn't buy by itself. It only comes in an assorted pack. I refused to buy the gift pack just to get 33% of the candy I liked.<br /><br />After a while I started seeing Ferrero Raffaello on shelves and I refrained by buying them since I didn't know they were from the same company, and also because I found out that they didn't contain chocolate. But one day I had a severe coconut craving and decided to get a pack anyway.<br /><br />The taste astounded me. I could hardly care that it didn't contain chocolate. When I put it in my mouth it gave me the same great tactile feeling, you know, the one where you burst the round sphere in your mouth and release the creamy goodness, then you crunch the small almond nucleus. It was heaven. I went out the next day and got 4  boxes. Taste wise, it isn't too sweet, which is good, and I love the coconut flakes, which stick in all the crevices between your teeth. The biggest problem for me is that 3 of them gives you 40% of your daily fat limit, so I restrict myself to 1 candy per day after a meal.<br /><br />In the end, taste is subjective, give it try. Maybe try the 3 pack first, if you like it, get this one.

review/summary: Absolute best ever coconut confection!
review/text: I'm not a huge coconut candy fan.  It's usually too sweet, sticky, and glob like.  However, I do like the taste and smell of fresh coconut.  This was given to us as a hostess gift.<br /><br />It really is fantastic.  Not only is it just lightly sweet, it is amazingly fresh and delicious, with lots of different textures.  The outside is coated with bits of coconut that taste like pure coconutty goodness.  Then there is that crisp crunchy sphere underneath.  Once you bite into it, there's the creamy coconut confection (again, not too sweet!) and then a delicious almond!  And 3 pieces only have 12 carbs, so it's not even as unhealthy as most candy.<br /><br />I will remember this candy, and probably will give it as a gift to others.  What a treat!

review/summary: Product Arrived Damaged Twice- UPDATE!!!
review/text: I had the same experience as another reviewer. I love this dressing and my local supermarket stopped carrying the product so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. My shipment arrived poorly packaged. All the bottles were leaking and the seals had been broken. Considering that the dressing needs to be refrigerated after being opened I did not want to eat it. I contacted Amazon and they sent me a replacement order free of charge. The second shipment was no better and I had to discard all the bottles. I wonder if Amazon is responsible for the poor packaging or if it is the vendor and whether or not it may be the heat during shipping that is causing all the seals to be broken.<br /><br />UPDATE: The manufacturer/company contacted me after this review and offered to send me a case of their dressing for my troubles. It arrived in a matter of days and all the bottles were undamaged. Their customer service is impeccable, making sure to follow up with me after I had received the delivery to ensure all was ok. I loved this product before and love it even more now. Wonderful experience! Thank you, WAFU!

I bought this junk, opened it, and it smelled an awful lot like urine, and the taste wasn't much better.  I have no idea what people put this on, I can't imagine this stuff, making anything taste better.  But like I said, this review may be unfair, since I was expecting a deep roasted, creamy sesame dressing, and all I got was a pungent vinegar based nostril burning disaster.  If I was looking for something with enough vinegar in it, to make my kitchen smell like pee, then the buck stops here!!!

review/summary: Its an instant bowl of rice that it tastes good. Try it!
review/text: Even though I live with roommates, whenever I cook a batch of rice in the rice cooker, somehow, after the first bowl I have with dinner, the rest of it always ends up going bad, which means I'm essentially wasting just as much rice as it would cost me to get a single portion like these little guys. My poor mother would be shocked at how much gets tossed.<br /><br />I love these things. They're way healthier than something like a cup of noodle, but super simple and you can eat them for lunch at the office where there's no easy way to make something like brown rice! Even my mom loves them and she cooks all her food from scratch. Yes, a little pricey for a bowl of rice, but considering the convenience and the fact that they're perfectly cooked, every time, its a no brainer. No need to refrigerate them, so you can keep them for awhile and not worry. Especially great if you crave rice sporadically, but can't be fussed with waiting 20 min for one bowl of rice.<br /><br />This is a perfect solution for anyone who is busy and doesn't have a family to cook for (think: students and  yuppies), don't like the American style instant rice, and love steamed brown rice. Definitely worth a try.

review/summary: Excellent dog food; especially good for dogs with health problems
review/text: We have three dogs- a small robust and healthy Coton de Tulear, and two large dogs with health issues: a nearly 7 year old German Shorthaired Pointer, who was diagnosed as diabetic two years ago, and an 8 year old  collie mix who has irritable bowels.  Trying to find the right food so that I didn't have to purchase too many kinds of dog food for two dogs with disparate health issues was not easy, but this Wellness Simple Solutions, along with the Wellness Core Dry does the job.<br /><br />If you suspect that food triggers allergic or stomach/bowel reactions, as any pediatrician will tell you, feed a simple diet with as few ingredients as possible, and only add ingredients as needed, after waiting for a time to watch for reactions.  Simple Solutions is the way to do this, and for a dog with irritable bowels, it is truly THE best way of feeding a commercially prepared dog food, instead of you cooking chicken and rice for your dog.  The dogs love the taste, and Wellness brand is excellent quality.

review/text: My 8-year old Cocker Spaniel has been on several types of food (Nutro, Iams, Natural Balance, Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, and regular Wellness). She would tolerate each for a short period of time, but then get diarrhea and would vomit. Our Vet suggested we try Wellness Simple Solutions, since it has only one protein and one carb source. We've had her on it for 3 months and she's shown no signs of upset stomach or irritable bowel. We suspect she is sensitive to chicken/chicken by-products, which the Rice and Salmon blend does not contain. The food is expensive, but it's worth the cost to have a healthy dog.....and clean house!

review/text: I have tried quite a few brands and types of kibble but none work as well in helping my Bichon to avoid skin problems, particularly itchiness, as this one does.  It helps that she really enjoys the taste too.<br /><br />Update: January 2012:<br /><br />Wellness Simple Solution Rice and Salmon is the only kibble that I feed to my bichon.  She loves it and I love the way it helps with her allergies plus the fact that she never has any digestion problems.  I use to buy the smaller bags because I was concerned about freshness.  Before finding this on Amazon, I had to special order it at a local pet specialty store and very often the packages had short time frame expiration dates.<br /><br />After seeing how good the dates were on the smaller packages that I bought from Amazon, I switched to the larger 10 lb,8 oz. bag.  I have been absolutely delighted by the freshness.  The bag that I ordered in early January 2012, arrived nicely packaged and with an expiration date of July, 2012.<br /><br />I'm happy that not only am I getting a wonderful food, made in the USA, but I can count on getting a fresh shipment too.

review/summary: dogs,too,are what they eat
review/text: we thought lily,at only 6 years of age, had about a year left to live - she was that weak and sickly. we wondered how our beautiful, strong german shepherd had failed so quickly. we decided that we had nothing to lose and perhaps it'd make her last days or months more pleasant if we took her off her natural supplements (glucosamine,msm,yucca), as well her pharmaceuticals. at the same time, we decided to change her dry dog food from a well-known brand we got at the supermarket to a more natural one. we did research and decided on Wellness Simple Solutions. we chose this one specifically because it had so few ingredients. lily was having alot of g.i. problems - she frequently vomited and it contained alot of mucus;she was itching alot and developed very scaly patches on her skin. she was a mess! her zest for life was disappearing. But, that was 3 months ago! lily no longer vomits; her itching has improved 85% or more; her coat is shiny and beautiful (people admire her wherever she goes); she goes on 45 min. leash or free walks/runs now, where just 3 mos. ago she was only able to go 15-20 mins. i attribute Much of her recovery to Wellness. it's so gratifying to see her feeling so Well again!

review/summary: Great but hard to find in person
review/text: This is the only dog food that we've found to work well for our small dog with many food allergies. The ingredients are simple and the pieces are small enough for little dogs to work with. We've been using this dog food for almost four years and he still loves it.<br /><br />It does smell like duck so if you are sensitive - be warned. :)

review/summary: Finally, some peace
review/text: Our dog has tried several foods, including expensive vet brands, and has been treated for ear infections, skin infections, and was constantly scratching and licking. We even tried other limited ingredient foods, only to have it upset her stomach and cause new problems. I bought this at the store thinking, "Okay, salmon and rice. This seems safe!"  I hoped that the fish would be good for her skin and the rice would be easy to digest.  We have been using this food now for a couple of months and she LOVES it, plus her scratching is gone and this food has never upset her stomach. It is sometimes hard to find in the pet stores so I'm buying on Amazon again. It saves running all over town, and the price is lower.

review/summary: Solved our skin issues
review/text: Understanding not all skin issues are alike, this food seems to have solved our issues.  My labradoodle developed a skin irritation that turned into a nasty infection in late november.  She was on Wellness Super 5 and salmon oil.  We thought it was just bacterial and dosed with antibiotics, but the irritation/infection came back worse than before.  I had tried grain free(Wellness Core), but things got worse, if anything.  We had to do another round of antibiotics due to another infection fromt he irritation and I felt like I was out of obvious solutions.  My vet suggested changing the type of protein to seafood(she has always been on chicken), so I tried this type of food.  Within a week of being fully transitioned onto this food, her excessive shedding (that started in november with the infections) had gone away and her skin had stopped developing lesions.  It's been almost a month and thing look great.  It could all be a coincidence, but I don't think I will be changing her food anytime soon!  Seems like a great solution for her.  Definitely worth trying!<br /><br />UPDATE July 28 2012<br />This formula (Salmon/Rice) has been changed to Salmon/Potato.  The number of ingredients have nearly doubled.  After months of doing so well on the Salmon/Rice food, I transitioned her onto this new food and her symptoms are re-appearing and she is not doing well.  This is a big disappointment.  I called Wellness and they said this food wasn't selling well and they changed the formulation.  Too bad - I will have to try another brand that is truly a limited ingredient diet.

review/summary: Miracle
review/text: I have three dogs, and one of them kept having bouts of diarrhea.  My vet gave her antibiotics and other prescription drugs to resolve the problem. These would work for about a week, and then the problem would return. My dog groomer suggested that there might be a food allergy involved.  I looked on Amazon.com and saw the "Wellness Limited Ingredient Diet for Dogs with Food Sensitivities Simple Food Solutions" dog food. I noted that the primary ingredent was lamb instead of corn...I ordered some and the first day I fed it to my dogs, it worked!!! My little dacshund Sugar had no more diarrhea or sickness from that day forward. I feed it to all my pets and I believe that they are actually happier now.  I am too!!!!

review/text: After spend $$$$ and several years of trying to find out what was creating fur loss (hot spots) and itching on my poor dog, it all came down to food allergies. This food is wonderful. It is one of the few choices out there that can be purchased on line or at a pet store without a perscription. So many pet owners try shots and pills that may be unnecessary. Start with the food!!!

However, this particular variety doesn't seem to be quite as big of a hit with them as the other Wellness canned varieties we've tried.  But they do eat it.  As for it helping with food allergies.. and for sensitive stomachs.. I'm not so sure yet.  I've been feeding it to them for several weeks now, but don't see any diference so far.

review/summary: Perfect for Dogs with Food Allergies
review/text: I have two yellow labs - one of which has severe food allergies (ear infections).  I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.  My female lab used to have persistant ear infections but since I started using the Simple line of dog food - the problems have disappeared.  I rotate between the duck and lamb flavors and she seems quite happy.  Never tried the salmon flavor.  I also treat both dogs with the Wellness biscuits (peanut/honey is their favorite).  Quality dog food well worth the cost!  My female lab is almost 7 now and the male is 5.  Both love the food and are very healthy.  Thanks Wellness!

review/summary: Mostly cured the red bumps on my dog's skin
review/text: Even our vet could not cure the red bumps on my dog's skin.  The rash and excoriation was unresponsive to oral antibiotics and topical steroid spray.  Our pet sitter recommended we try a dog food without known allergens, so we tried Wellness Rice & Salmon.  It really works! Our dog still gets some redness but she is so much better.  The only negative is that apparently the food doesn't taste that great. Our solution is to mix it with a very small amount of canned cat food (about 1 tablespoon of our cat's Newman Organics), and our dog gobbles it right down.

review/text: My dog loves this food and I like it because it's low residue and doesn't upset his tummy.  Less waste when he goes makes it more comfortable for him and easier to pick up for me.  The only complaint (besides the price!) would be the smell of the food if you sniff it.  It doesn't make his breath smell.  I may try the lamb one next time (to compare smells), but I definitely recommend this food.

review/summary: Excellent! My dog's skin looks amazing and he loves this food!
review/text: I honestly wish the other reviewer would have not given this product such a poor review. While the kibbles are not small in this food (about the size of a lima bean in length and half a grape in girth), and I do believe that this product is perfect for medium to large dogs, this is most definitely a quality dogfood. My lab-mix has suffered a great deal in the past from skin problems, and since changing to this food, he has improved 85%, and I am thrilled! Don't let a bad review dissuade you from trying this; it's great! And perhaps the small to teacup sized dogs could try the cat food in this brand, which my dog and cat love! The cat food kibble is the size of a small pea. To good health and happy feeding! :)

review/summary: Revised opinion
review/text: Update 11/12/11: I previously posted a review on the Simple Solutions Lamb & Rice Formula a few months ago, which I have since deleted.  I gave it a negative review because my dog, a miniature long-haired Dachshund, initially did not want to eat it. I would mix it with his old food, a good quality mostly all protein food (Orijen) that he loved--Orijen gets 6 stars at dogfoodanalysis.com, which is why I chose it. My dog would pick out the Orijen and leave the Simple Solutions in his bowl untouched.  However, my dog was getting constant ear infections that would not clear up with medication. I spent quite a bit on vet bills. I finally decided to try a different dog food to see if there was an allergy and tried Simple Solutions. As I said, initially he did not like it, but I continued to give it to him, and now he's eating it just fine.  When the Lamb & Rice almost ran out, I decided to try the Duck & Rice formula, which I'm slowly incorporating into the Lamb & Rice.  He really loves the Duck & Rice food and literally jumps up and down when he knows he going to be fed.  Also, the ear infections are completely gone.  I think this is an excellent food for dogs with sensitive stomachs or allergies, which apparently includes my dog.  I do wish some of the stores close to me would carry it though so I didn't have to purchase it online.  Fortunately, Amazon is selling it with free shipping, which was pretty fast also.<br /><br />I want to add that dogfoodanalysis.com only gives Wellness Simple Solutions 4 out of 6 stars because of the protein level, which is why I haven't given my review 5 stars. It states:<br />"Overall, we are happy with the quality of most of the ingredients in the food. The ingredient list is deliberately simple and designed for allergic dogs who may not tolerate a wide range of ingredients. We have concerns, however, at the apparently low level of meat content of the food."

review/summary: Good food for sensitive dog
review/text: I've been feeding this dog food to my older female pug for several months now. In the fall of this year she began to experience allergy related skin and stomach issues. These allergies resulted in excessive licking and nibbling at her feet as well as occasional throwing up. She hasn't thrown up since she started eating this food, and overall her skin issues have lessened (that could be a result of the change in seasons as well). She is always excited to eat her food, but what pug isn't? I mean they're always hungry right? Also, as she never seems to drink enough water, I'm glad she's getting some moisture as part of this soft food as well. The only thing I find displeasing out this product is that we buy it in cases, and the cans frequently arrive dented. I wouldn't buy dented cans for my own food, for fear of the food being tainted in some way. So I feel a little nervous feeding my dog some of these dented cans. Oh well, she seems fine thus far and the smell and look of the food is fairly consistent, so we're going to stick with this food for now.

review/summary: not much better than I the salmon flavored one.
review/text: Obviously, any dog's reaction to various foods are dependent on their own allergies.  I switched from Wellness Simple Salmon because of the fishy smell of the food and my pit/lab's fishy breath. If it wasn't for the fishy breath, I would have kept him on it. I was actually very pleased with the results of that food.  I decided to switch to the duck flavor hoping that his breath would improve.  His breath for sure has improved and has been normal for a dog, but he has had diarrhea and loose stool on it since we put him on it for the past 4 weeks.  He has also been biting his paws and itching more than he had been on the salmon flavor.  We have had to mix 1/2 a cup of the duck flavor with boiled chicken, rice, and sweet potato in order for his stools to return to normal. But at any time we feed him just this dog food, he will have extremely watery diarrhea.  Quite disappointed with this and would definitely recommend purchasing a small bag first to see if your dog can tolerate it.<br /><br />Not quite sure what we're gonna do next. We might have to put our hyper allergic pit/lab mix on a homemade diet because that seems like the only thing that works for him.

The soup is delicious and overall fairly healthy for you.<br /><br />I like that the soup provides a good deal of chicken, vegetables and even the rice tastes fresh! The broth is also very tasty. Healthy Choice makes a high quality chicken noodle soup than most other brands because they include chicken and rice while keeping limits on fats, sugars and cholesterol.<br /><br />One look at the ingredients shows us more positives: There are no trans fats and the soup has almost zero saturated fat. It is also extremely low in cholesterol. However, it does contain sodium (480 mg per serving) so if you need to watch your sodium intake please consider this before buying this product.<br /><br />Unfortunately, sometimes the top lid is difficult to remove and then you have to handle the bowl very carefully to avoid spilling the soup. The soup is filled up almost to the brim of the bowl; and so it's easy to spill a little! The top lid is somewhat cumbersome and doesn't really help enough when it's on top of the bowl inside the microwave oven, either. The cover didn't completely cover the soup bowl in the microwave and some soup spilled inside the microwave. And yes, you DO need a solid surface on which you can open this container otherwise you are almost certain to have a spill because the soup bowl is filled completely.<br /><br />Overall, the soup itself is excellent. The packaging, on the other hand, is nothing special. The cover lid is cumbersome to remove and inside the microwave soup can spill out through the cover. I think that the packaging drives the cost of this soup higher than it otherwise might be. The packaging needs to be changed; perhaps Healthy Choice could make a slightly higher bowl so that the soup won't easily spill out when you remove the plastic lid.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for people who love chicken soup with vegetables and rice if they don't need to worry about sodium in their diets. If you are bothered by the packaging, however, then try another brand. Five stars for the actual soup combined with three stars for the packaging makes this a four star review.

review/summary: Incorrect Nutritional Information
review/text: While the product may be tasty and fine, the nutritional information displayed here (100 calories for the entire bowl) is incorrect. I visited the Healthy Choice website to verify my information -- the soup is 100 calories per cup. Nearly 200 calories for the entire bowl.
