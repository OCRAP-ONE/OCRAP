review/summary: alot of variety
review/text: I have been enjoying this variety pack for a week now. I only got one flavor repeated 4x. Everything else I got 2 of. And I was glad because if I liked the flavor I wanted another cup of that flavor! And it helped me decide on flavors I thought I would like and did not. Glad I didn't buy a whole box of those flavors! The four stars is only because I didn't love every flavor. Its a good variety pack to start with.

review/text: I bought this at Costco.  Thought it was amazingly wonderful and went back to get more.  It was gone.  I had the manager look it up and discovered that Costco had discontinued it - but the manager found some at a store 15 miles away.  I drove there right away and bought them out.  160 packets.  That's how good I think it is.  We are half way through, and I was getting a little anxious tonight as I made dinner.  So, yeah, Amazon carries it.  My kids love this.  90 seconds and it's done!

review/summary: Much Cheaper Elsewhere!
review/text: Yes, the flavor and nutritional value of this product is off the charts fabulous. However, it can be had for much less at vitacost.com! Initial pricing of $41.34 for a 12-pack with $4.99 shipping. But... they always offer a 10% off coupon for new customers, and once you get on their email list, they frequently offer additional discount coupons. I got my first order for $37.20 for a 12-pack (I ordered two since we go through this yummy stuff fairly quickly.) Also it is available to receive via an autoship schedule, which is offered at 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 or 120 day higher day shipping intervals, and will save you 5% on each order. I am stunned that Amazon is charging such a significant amount more for this same item. Hopefully they will drop their pricing once they learn of their competition.

review/text: Absolutely delicious. I wasn't expecting much from plain rice+quinoa, but this tastes very good. I ate it plain and couldn't stop with one serving. It was hard for me to believe that it has brown rice. I didn't buy it from Amazon, I just picked one packet up from a local store for checking it out. A great way to add quinoa for those of us who don't get around to cooking with it.

review/summary: Will never buy again...
review/text: I'm afraid, after reading the other reviews, that perhaps I may have purchased a 'bad batch' or something (I purchased from Costco like one of the other reviewers) as I absolutely did not like this product at all.<br /><br />I love quinoa, brown rice & quinoa/rice blends. I love garlic and lots of it. Raw, baked, paste, confit in oil...you name it. This, sadly, wasn't rice/quinoa/garlic as I know it.<br /><br />-First off, the blend doesn't quite look like it shows on the package, of course. The colours are more drab and khaki-hued. Yummy! There's also not nearly as much quinoa in the package as there appears to be in the picture. I normally expect packaging to be misleading but in the picture it looks like roughly 60/40 or 50/50 rice:quinoa. In real life, it's more like 90/10...MAYBE 75/25 if you want to be generous.<br /><br />-Secondly, whatever Seeds of Change did to the 'garlic' in this stuff shouldn't happen to a hardened criminal! The smell is unbearable. Pungent, cloying and slightly sour. Very unappetising. Mixed with the drab colour of the final cooked product, it doesn't really put it's best foot forward if you know what I mean. Just by the smell and look alone, I was already losing my appetite, and I was *quite* hungry when we prepared this. Great if you're on a diet, I suppose...<br /><br />-It tastes as bad as it smells, but fortunately not as cloying. There is no depth of flavour, so the taste doesn't really linger long on the tongue. This is actually in the 'Pro' column since the taste is dreadful. Flat, cardboard-like, faintly acrid, and the only thing vaguely resembling garlic is the aftertaste and smell it leaves on your breath. When there's more aftertaste than initial taste, that's never a good sign. It's as if they took immature garlic, slightly burnt it, dehydrated it, pulverised it to a fine powder and threw it in the package as an afterthought. VERY disappointing as I've had other Seeds of Change products and liked them quite a bit!<br /><br />-I *will* say that they did a great job on the texture. The texture was very nice, just the right kind of 'al dente' that I like. This, regrettably, put all the other defects of the product into sharper relief. If only it didn't taste terrible!<br /><br />-You might be able to doctor this product up with some sort of sauce or extra seasonings but 1)that could be risking making it worse and 2)why would you waste the time and effort. Simply buy something else.<br /><br />But, please, do yourself a favour and don't buy this.

review/summary: The Great American Chocolate Bar
review/text: When I lived in the U.K., I was exposed to Chocolate bars from all over Europe, and liked several very much, but when I was near American Air Bases, I would always get a friend to get me a Hershey Almond Bar, because I never found any candy I liked as well as this classic.<br /><br />For a short while I thought that Hershey had outdone themselves with the advent of the Gold Bars, but they were discontinued after a short run. I did get to see them made and got one from the visitor's center while they were still available though.<br /><br />So, although it may be relative to what you grow up with, if it is a choice between a gourmet chocolate, and a Hershey Almond Bar, give me the Hershey's every time. The Giant Size bars are the best since the end of the Golden Bar, but if you are staring at the vending machine and can't decide what you want... You can't go wrong with a Hershey Bar!

But the flavor of this brand, I think is very nice.

It tastes so wonderful when you finally bite into the pop and you get that mix of gum and fruity hard candy. Delicious! This box was wonderful and very tasty, although I have to say that they put in way too many cherry pops. Those are my least favorite, and at the end, all I had left were a bunch of cherry pops. I ended up just giving the rest of them away at Halloween. That being said, the box was still great. It's nice to be able to eat a Blow Pop anytime you want!

review/text: When I "accidently" stumbled across these on Amazon, I just had to order these. at first I was bummed because it said that I would not receive them until 12JUL2011... and I ordered them on 23JUN2011. Yet again though, Amazon pulls through and I received them on 29JUN2011 (and I am currently stationed overseas.)<br /><br />Anyways, on the flavor... they still tasted as great as they were when I was younger.. I think I went through 10 suckers right away (especially the Green Apple.) Also the Suckers came in a pretty big box, but nothing was damaged or anything (so was pretty happy there...Fresh opening)<br /><br />I gave it 5 stars from the following:<br /><br />Taste: 5/5<br />Freshness: 4.5/5<br />Delivery Time: 5/5<br />As good as I remembered them: 5/5<br /><br />In my honest opinion, if you love Blowpops and just want a good box to lay around the house / Workspace, Etc for the occasional great snack. I would def recommend buying from here as in my experience, I had no problem with them.

review/text: My whole family loves this gourmet lolipop! It all started on Halloween when my daughter came home with a bag full of candy. There was every candy you could imagine! Tootsie rolls,Tootsie pops,Hershey's,Reese's,Kit Kat,Milky Way, Snickers and then this mysterious candy in a wrapper. When I tasted it I was about to pass out. THIS WAS DELICIOUS! I told the whole family about it. I saw on the wrapper it said "Blow Pop". So I told them the name of the lolipop and they tried some. They said it was delicious. My daughter told all the kids at school and in the neighborhood. My wife told all her friends. Soon it was a Blow Pop party! We invited everyone we knew. Inside a Blow Pop is bubble gum which you chew when you are done with this yummy lolipop. You can buy this online like on Amazon and ebay. And you can buy them at party stores and grocery stores and toy stores. Anyone would like to try a Blow Pop!

review/summary: Hard to get wrapper off
review/text: I love blow pops. They taste great and last a long time. They have a big problem. It's very difficult to remove the wrapper. What happens is the wrapper sticks to the stick and you can't pull it off. They must use super glue. You might think it's a safety feature, but you can take the wrapper off the portion that covers the edible part fairly easily. You're forced to eat the lollipop with a plastic wrapper in your mouth. What I do is if the wrapper doesn't come off, I throw it out and try another. So instead of 100 lollipops per box, I get maybe 80 or so I can actually eat.

review/summary: My son's favorite!!
review/text: These are my son's favorite snack, even though he is really past the Gerber toddler line of food.  They are so much healthier than some of the other alternatives in the grocery store.  My only disappointment stems from that Amazon no longer offers this product as a Subscribe and Save item.

review/summary: Toddler loves them, definitely spendy...
review/text: I get these for the car, and my son (7/2/08) loves them.  The best price is to get them through Subscribe & Save, and we get one pack of 6 delivered each month, which is just about enough for us.  He gets one in the morning on the way to daycare, and one in the evening on the way home.  It's nice because they're not messy and don't get his fingers very sticky!  But yes, as others point out, they're not exactly cheap...

My only suggestion is check the local supermarket where they usually sell for about $2.50 a box.  I'm not sure why they are so much more expensive here. But if you have a toddler, check them out!

review/summary: soooo  good!!!
review/text: These thing are awesome. My very picky 18mo old son will eat them all day if I let him. They are soft and break down in the mouth quickly to reduce choking.Best description would be a mix of applesauce and strawberry puree thats shaped into a small bar. My son tends to eat everything whole, so I have to break them into about 8 small pcs for him. They are really expensive since the pkg only contains around 5 little bars, but are well worth it for the toddler who currently will only eat milk, pepperoni and cheese!!

review/summary: Excellent dog food!
review/text: I'm very pleased with this grain-free, healthy yet highly-palatable dog food made with human-grade ingredients. (By the way, duck is sometimes better than chicken for dogs with alleriges.) Both of my dogs love the Dogswell canned foods. I like to buy them a variety of canned food to mix in with their dry food. They never miss a beat when it's time for them to eat. They come running everytime! A couple of folks commented on the strong smell of this product (with duck) but I don't think it's that bad. The dogs love it. Plus, I always add wild salmon oil to my dogs' dinners for their skin and coat - the Omega fatty acids are so good for them. Just because we as individuals may not love gamey/fishy smells, the fact is the dogs love the food and it's really good for them. Besides, there are plenty of products that can help with their breath if an owner feels it to be necessary. I personally have never been bothered by the smell of this dog food, and I highly recommend it. Your dog will be very happy.

I've checked all our Feed Stores in the area and could not find a lower price. We even subscribed to the "Auto Ship" and it comes to our door automatically every 60 days. Gotta love it! The only thing that "bothered" me was our very first shipment of Duck (12cans) came with every single can of food dented in some way. I decided to chalk it up to chance and wait on the second shipment before raising Cain. The second shipment was in perfect condition so we're very happy.

Just the good stuff. I highly recommend this product. Even our cat tries to take a nibble -- it seems irrestible.

review/summary: Highest Quality Dog Food at this price!!!!
review/text: I did a lot of research before settling on this product. The dogs love it and it is of the highest quality. Lots of protein, with little fat or carbohydrates. I use this mixed with Premium Edge dry dog food. You can spend more but your return on investment will be neglible. No by products, no fillers, chelated vitamins for easier absorbtion, and the list goes on. Compare labels to the so called "premium brands" and see for yourself. I suggest a gradual transition from whatever you are feeding now (2 or 3 months minimum) because of the drastic change in protein level of this dog food over the competition.

review/summary: Made my dog sick
review/text: I was used to buying this item off the shelf, but was disgusted by the contents of my mail order.  First off, the product image is misleading.  The image shows the "Vitality" duck and sweet potato product (which I was familiar with and wanted), but what came was the "Happy Hips" duck and sweet potato product.  My roommate had actually purchased the "Happy Hips" product through the mail before and while we noticed some uneven quality, my order was disgusting.  The contents of most of the 12 cans in the cans in the first box had congealed into a super hard blob with none of the meat chunks and vegetables recognizable, and covering the top and interspersed in the contents were what looked like maggots.  I tried the can with the best looking contents, convinced myself that the white grains were rice (even though rice is not listed in the ingredients) and mixed some as usual with my dog's dry food.  When I came home from work today, my dog had thrown up twice.  I opened one of the cans in the second box just to see what was inside.  The contents of it looked much more like what I was used to, but I saw some of the "rice grains" on top.  That was it - I called Amazon and asked for a refund.  It's hard for me to blame Dogswell because I have liked their products for so long, but either on their end or the seller's, a BAD product is being distributed!  I won't be able to bring myself to try this project again for a long time, if ever.

I was used to milder flavor like Aunt Jemima used to make, but they quit making theirs over 10 years ago so don't make the mistake of picking a brand shown on line that no longer makes it. Bob's Red Mill makes a milder version similar to the Aunt Jemima. keep in mind that one bag of this brand doesn't make a lot so order a couple bags to have enough for a family breakfast.

review/text: I ordered a one pound package for my Dad this Christmas, so I can't really comment on the flavor yet, though my Dad has liked pepper flavored salt before.  However, I was very impressed with the speed with which The Spice Labe sent it.  I was also expecting to get a sigle large box or bag, like you'd see on a store shelf.  Instead, the salt came in eight 2oz. vacuum sealed, durable plastic bags, so I know that the salt will maintain its freshness no matter how long it takes for my Dad to get through it.  Very nice.  Also, they included several differnt little sample packets so I could try some of their different flavors of salt without having to order tons of it.  My package included a sampler of himalayan sea salt (larger chunks), french grey salt, himalayan salt (with crystals sized like table salt, hickory smoke salt, and haba&ntilde;ero salt.  Very cool.  I will be getting more stuff from them.<br /><br />ADDENDUM 12/26:  About flavor:  my Dad says this salt tastes better than other ghost pepper salt he's tried.  He attributes it to both a better product and better packaging (see my above comments).

More of a medium heat but the flavor is good.<br /><br />I will place another order simply to determine if I was unlucky and received a package which had been sitting around a while.<br /><br />UPDATE: My second order was perfect. Brett took a personal intrest to make certain I was completely happy. Still not as hot as I would like, but I will order again.

review/summary: GREAT product
review/text: I absolutely love this product and fine myself putting it on a great number of foods.  My only complaint is it isn't quite as hot as I'd like so you end up making your food a bit too salty to get the desired amount of heat.  Still, a great addition to your spice cabinet.

review/summary: Can't go wrong with Demae Ichou Ramen
review/text: You can never go wrong with the Nissin Demae Ichou brand ramen. I lived in Kyushu for many years and this reminded me of Hakata ramen. I'm glad I got this but I wasn't happy with the batch I got thats going to be expired in one month. It will take me a while to finish the whole box (I don't eat ramen everyday)! If you plan on buying instant food online, you should definitely contact the seller about the expiration date.

review/text: While I was in Japan I had the chance to taste real Tonkotsu ramen, I must say it's the most delicious soup I have ever had, I live in Peru so I am used to good cuisine, but none can get close to Tonkostsu. I am not able to find a Ramen House here here so I decided to try this, it is really good, they have made it very similar to the real one, I purchased several packed pork ramen and this is one of the best I could find. You got to try this, I am not kidding, it's very good, specially if you add some Nanani Togarashi to it, uhmmm, I will make one right now !!!!

review/text: We used to have another brand tonkotsu flavor noodle imported from Japan until a few years ago, but US has stopped importing any of them from Japan for some reasons.  So I was so happy when I finally found this product.  It is made in Hong Kong, but all of my family love the flavor and it tastes as good as Japanese tonkotsu noodle.  Strongly recommended.  You will enjoy it, too.

review/summary: Great Cakes!
review/text: These cakes are fairly exploding with flavor and the kids love making charts depicting which flavors can be found under the robes of confection.  We order these at nearly every special occasion.  One warning that merited knocking a star off is that there are invariably four or five within the box that are hard and dry within.  That's not very nice when serving these to guests and there is no way to tell just by looking at it.<br /><br />Also, my last batch had one whole flavor (the chocolate-robed with green diagonal stripes) where every one of them was dry.  It only happened once and my family loves these too much to knock it down another star for that.

review/summary: Garlic-stuffed olives
review/text: I have tried many different brands of garlic-stuffed olives and of all of them the Mezzetta brand is by far my favorite. I'm not sure what is it that the other brands do differently, but Mezzetta uses very large green olives and the juice that they are stored in is probably what distinguishes them from others.<br /><br />If you have tried other brands and really didn't care for them that much, try this brand. I can't guarantee that you'll like them as well as I do, but they probably have a better chance of also being your favorite than most other brands. I could be wrong and there may be better brands, but I keep sampling every new brand that I come across and I just keep coming back to the Mezzetta brand of garlic-stuffed Olive. I go through at least one jar a month.

review/summary: Best stuff on earth...but it's not "hot chocolate" only
review/text: At the time of this review the title notes that this is a "hot chocolate tin" while it can easily be made into "hot chocolate" the buyer should know this is unsweetened cocoa...not a hot chocolate mix.  BUT...<br /><br />that said...<br /><br />Coming from a household of two foodies, two gourmet cooks (one a trained chef) and chocolate LOVERS...if you have yet to replace whatever cocoa you are using  with Scharffen berger, best do so now. :-)  Ohhhh this stuff is the best.<br /><br />I actually read about this cocoa, cough cough, in People Magazine about 10 years ago and was intriqued due to the level of true cocoa bean in it...unlike any other so called "gourmet" cocoa.  At that time I couldn't find it anywhere and had to order it from the company. Now I find it in some grocery stores...unfortunately just the "upscale" or "all natural ones"..not a bad thing, but I don't shop there every week, so not a good thing either for me at least if you are trying to find it locally.  I hope to see it more mainstream soon.<br /><br />Because we are foodies, if we like something at a restaurant it's not uncommon for us to wind up talking to the manager or chef about ingredients that stand out. In the past 3 years when I have asked about a chocolate dessert I think only once were they not using this.<br /><br />Is it great as hot cocoa? Sure...but that is SO limiting its use. I just use it for any recipe calling for cocoa.<br /><br />Negative: I have no negative on taste or quality and ratio of real cocoa used...that can't be beat. However, the price is higher...I'd rather have it in a less fancy tin and kick it down a notch on price...but I pay it and so does anyone else I know into baking...so maybe they don't have to consider that...still, it is higher so I have to grumble SOME...

review/summary: Very Good but also Very Pricey
review/text: Okay: just in case you're not familiar, a whisky cake is basically a fruit cake with a good swig of whisky thrown in for flavour. That's what we get here. I think the term "shortbread" is just used as part of the "Walker's Shortbread" brand, because as far I noticed, there was nary a trace of anything even remotely like shortbread to be found.<br /><br />As fruit cakes go, this one is defintiely top of the range. It's a great cake. I confess my own pallet is nowhere near refined enough to specifically identify Glenfiddich as the whisky used, but hey, yours may differ.<br /><br />But yes, as fruit cakes go, this is definitely a five star one. No question. Hence the rating. On the other hand, it is also a very expensive one. If I were going to factor "value for money" into my rating, I'd probably knock it down to just four stars.<br /><br />One final thought: the tin in which this cake is comes is a nice and enduring one, and the lid is not of the type that is damaged when removed. So hey, as an added bonus you also get something pretty in which to store buttons, loose change, or whathaveyou. If you're like me, the tin will still be around for many years after the cake is long gone.<br /><br />Theo.

review/text: I do a great deal of online ordering, and I have to say the Walkers Shortbread Glenfiddich Whiskey cake was the biggest disappointment.  Reading the ingredients, one would expect a refined flavor of shortbread and Scotch whiskey.  I expected a bit of buttery flavor with the shortbread in the ingredients.  What I received was a rather small round tin with a fruitcake inside that tasted exactly the same (we did a taste test) as the $1.00 fruit cake purchased at Fred's dollar store.  Visual comparison revealed no discernable difference between the Glenfiddich cake and the Fred's Dollar Store cake.  I expected a better product for the money, and did not receive it.  I am so disappointed.

review/summary: Excellent
review/text: People seem to get EXTRACT and PURE OIL confused. Alcohol has to be added because it literally brings the flavor out of the small quantity of peppermint leaves that were actually used. If you don't want a product with alcohol then purchase the oil since they're usually 100% pure, nobody's forcing anyone to get the extract. But anyway, I used this along with cinnamon oil to make toothpicks, this flavor is very potent (No weak, sugary stuff here) It's so potent that I had to make my cinnamon and peppermint toothpicks in two different areas of the kitchen, or else the flavors and scents will overlap eachother and you will have a cinnamon/peppermint tasting toothpick. This also feels amazing when mixed with lotion. Why pay nearly 10 bucks for some goldbond when you can put a teaspoon of this in your $2.00 lotion and feel that instant tingle. You can even soak the head of your toothbrush in it and it lasts for several brushings. All in all, great buy; but please know...THIS IS THE EXTRACT!!! The company that makes these products doesn't deserve the bad reviews based on people's inability to decipher the two. Once again, this product IS THE EXTRACT!!!
