Why get the gmo stuff when you can get<br />real organic?  I'm tired of genetically modified<br />food that is probably killing us all!!  When will<br />somebody do something about it?  Until someone<br />does, the best way we can fight back is to buy<br />organic.

review/summary: Farmer's Market Dog treats from Plato
review/text: I ordered these for my 3 dogs because the ingredient list had nothing I wouldn't eat listed. My dogs absolutely love them. Not only are they good for your dog, but they're made in the USA!  There is no melamine in wheat gluten added to up the protein content.  The first ingredient on the list is Salmon.  AAA+ for Plato treats.

review/text: It's a chocolate beehive, with a walnut on top, and marshmallow fluff on the inside. It's reeeally sweet. I won't recommend this to people with diabeetus. I give it a four, however, that might be because it reminds me of Tunnock's Snowballs. But I think that the chocolate is a bit overwhelming, though good, hence the 4 stars. It nearly got a three.

review/summary: Excellent Greek white - great for entertaining
review/text: You don't have to be Greek to enjoy this fabulous white. I often find it hard to interpret professional wine reviews so I will provide the simplest evaluation possible. Imagine an excellent Savignon Blanc with a mild citrus taste but slightly sweeter. That is what you experience with the 2011 Santorini Sigalas Assyrtiko. It is an excellent white wine to serve at a gathering,  with or without hors d'oeuvres.<br /><br />If you have never had an assyrtiko or moschofilero, they tend to be slightly sweeter than most mainstream whites from California or Australia but are a long way from dessert wines.  To the American pallet, Moscholifero tends to have overall stronger taste than assyrtiko. Of all of the Greek white wines I have tasted, this is the best. Friends agree.  It is also a solid value at the 20 dollar price point. Incidentally, this wine is one of the highest rated ever by major reviewers -- 93 points by the Wine Advocate.<br /><br />Greek wines often haven't been well received in the US by non-Greeks.  From what I have experienced, there are a handful of truly awful Greek wines that simply taste nothing like mainstream white wines.  These extremes have tainted reviewers and dissuaded consumers from exploring Greek wines. This wine is a example of something mainstream consumers and connoisseurs alike can enjoy - either with dinner or while entertaining.

review/summary: Better and cheaper than the competition
review/text: Got this for my kids.  Halfway through his first box my five year old announced it was better than the stuff with the cows on it.  I agree, it is better.  On top of that, the package contains more cartons than than the organic product for less money.  Of course it's from cows not treated with rbST.<br /><br />Here are the ingredients: Reduced fat milk, sugar, contains 1% or less of each of the following: cocoa (processed with alkali), cocoa, carrageenan, salt, artificial flavor, vitamin A palmitate and vitamin D3.<br /><br />Chocolate milk is the only dairy product that I think tastes good with carrageenan in it.  Most chocolate milks have it.  It's made from seaweed, has been a food product for centuries, and adds a nice creaminess to the drink.<br /><br />In short, great product, great price, and great for the kids (especially when traveling.)

review/summary: Taste Great
review/text: We picked some of these up this week. They're very convenient and quite handy to have around just to grab when you're walking out the door. The taste is about what you'd expect from Hershey's chocolate milk, it's chocolate, it's sweet, and it's really good. It's nice that they don't need to be refrigerated either, at least until after they are opened.<br /><br />On the one hand these are better for a child than cola, but on the other hand there's still a lot of sugar in them and 200 calories in only 8 oz. I'm looking at the servings right now and for one container it has 29 g of sugar. I'll grant you it's not empty calories because there's 30% of the daily intake of calcium, but still if you can train the kid to drink skim milk that's fewer calories for them.<br /><br />When I was a kid my parents used to give me skim milk with not much chocolate powder in it. My real treat was the 2% chocolate milk at school, but it was fairly rare to get it; they'd have chocolate milk maybe once a week. These things probably aren't all that bad by comparison to some of the junk food kids eat. I just feel a little wary if feeding them lunch for lunch because the calories do add up.<br /><br />I'd never tell anybody how to raise their kids (or what to drink themselves), but I for one plan to have these as a treat every now and then instead of as a regular part of my diet. Anyway, they are tasty and I'd recommend.

review/summary: A Chocolate Milk for All Seasons (And Reasons)
review/text: I bought this UHT small packaged milk because my fridge was getting old and not keeping milk cold enough to avoid spoilage. Compared to the horizon milk I think the Hershey's milk may have a more chocolate flavor, though that might be because this has more sugar. I also like this compared to big .5 gallon to 1 gallon chocolate milks from  the grocery store as the portions are controlled for you, which makes drinking it easier on the conscience. Price-wise, if you subscribe its slightly cheaper than horizon milk of the same package size was at the local Wal-mart.

Not going to downgrade the flavor because of the price. I don't buy this to drink every day. I buy it & the white milk for my emergency food supplies. The small size is perfect. Allows me to drink the milk up & not have to worry about keeping the open leftover cold. Because there is not any leftover!  Very nice product for emergency food supplies.

review/summary: Good Rice!
review/text: We have always preferred this rice over others. Unfortunately, our local Giant seems to have stopped stocking it, so I turned to Amazon. The only drawback is that it is shipped (very promptly) by a third party, so PRIME shipping does not apply, thus making the rice rather expensive. Since we are empty nesters we don't use the product so often as to make this unaffordable.<br /><br />Recipe: rinse the rice, measure out just under twice the amount of water, add a generous pat of butter, a vegetable or chicken bouillon cube and some green cardamon pods and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the rice, bring back to the boil, cover and cook over very low heat until fully absorbed. Remove the pods and fluff with a fork.

Then I stumbled across Ahmad English Afternoon Tea on a remote island in the Pacific being sold by a Pipe and Drum Corps as a fundraiser. I was immediately hooked on that and when I couldn't get that tea from them anymore, I went hunting online. That's when I came across Ahmad's English Tea No.1. It has become my everyday tea. I love the smoothness that accompanies the full body of this tea. I still have English Afternoon Tea on occasion - but this is my fave! I drink it straight hot and cold, with milk and with milk and sugar.

review/summary: Grain free goodness!
review/text: I've been suspecting that my dog has grain allergies so we decided to try better foods out there as she's been switching every few months. She is on Ziwipeak freeze dried food but after she was ill last year, she became accustomed to wet food so we've been finding her different canned foods to use as toppers. Fromm is decent but after a bad batch of over 15 cans and noticing that our puppy was drinking excessive amounts of water, we wanted to find alternatives to Fromm and Ziwipeak canned because she gets bored easily. After trying Taste of the Wild, Merrick, Great Life, Wellness, etc, she was ecstatic when we let her sample Addiction. She loves it! There's different flavors to choose from (all of which are grain-free!) and the consistency is a little softer than pate and it actually doesn't smell awful like most canned dog foods out there.<br /><br />She's tried the Venison Stew and Turkey with Cranberries and Apples and loves both. We're going to see how she likes the other flavors available.

review/summary: Safe and Soothing
review/text: The Organic Tummy Soothers are the BEST type of antacid EVER. There are no side effects as with regular OTC antacids. Relief is within 30 minutes for bloating, gas, upset tummy, and that full feeling from eating too much or something rich. I have just had better results with St. Clair's products, than with the OTC products.

review/summary: Wonderful Gift/ Long shipping time
review/text: We had this shipped directly to our family in another part of the country. They thought it was a beautifully put together and wonderful present. They loved everything inside of it and they tend to be very picky. The only complaint I have is it took forever to ship! Although I personally didn't see it from what I understand it was worth the wait.

review/summary: Tart, refreshing and curbs appetite...
review/text: The flavor is tart.  It tastes like a slightly sweetened cranberry spritzer with a little "Je ne sais quois."  If you don't know any French, that translates to "I don't know what."  It must be the flavors of the monk fruit and chokeberries that are listed in the ingredients, as I am not familiar with those flavors.  I like that it isn't overly sweet.  Some people are a little put off by the flavor of stevia; I am not.  It tastes nice and is refreshing.  I am pleased with the list of ingredients, which are all-natural.  The mere 25 calorie count is pretty great.<br /><br />So, it's lovely that it tastes good, but how does it perform at hunger curbing?  I drank it before an afternoon trip to the gym, which was before my late lunch.  I then ate my lunch two hours later.  I think it worked!

review/text: So nice to have a natural, healthy drink for a boost of energy mid-day.  A little carbonation - and not too sweet.  And yes, it did seem to curb my afternoon cravings!

Helps them get thru afternoon homework without drinking sugary coke or other caffeinated products.

review/summary: Good - with a caveat
review/text: As I recently became vegan, and have incorporated tofu into my diet, I wanted to get a protein powder that was without dairy and soy.  This one fit the bill, and has vitamins and minerals included that many vegans risk being deficient in (B12, Calcium, Iron).  I add it to my oatmeal, I think it makes the taste richer and I appreciate that there are no added sweeteners.  The reason I give the product 4 stars is that, although I should have inspected more closely and seen this before purchasing, it has 270mg sodium per serving.  I find this to be too high, I even find my oatmeal a bit too salty.  Thus, I plan to mix this with another soy-free powder to lower the sodium content.  Otherwise, I think this is a great product.

review/summary: Booster
review/text: Have been using this product for several years mostly in smoothies and shakes and yes there is a bit of a weird taste maybe from the pea or possibly the mushrooms that have been unable to mask no matter what tried. Yet nutritionally this booster is quite good... so, in my opinion, it is worth it; maybe have even developed a liking to the taste. Currently using this product more in foods like soups and it really seems to work better flavor-wise. Also for baking (breads, muffins, vege-burgers, loafs) it's a great way top bump up your protein intake.

review/summary: Naturade Soy Free Veg Protein Booster
review/text: This is for the hardier consumer, taste wise. If you don't mind the flavor of powdered peas, this one is for you. Good texture, good dissolvability. Price is what you would expect--no bargain but not a killer. There is, however, most definitely the flavor of peas there, and nothing really covers it up. I like peas when they are green and I have to chase them around on my plate. In the form of a vanilla, or chocolate, or coffee, or banana, or blackberry, etc., etc. drink?--naw.

review/summary: Great NON-SOY protein powder
review/text: Thank god somebody came out with a non-soy protein powder alternative! Soy is added to almost every food product out there and it's NOT GOOD FOR OUR BODIES!!<br />Some people may not like the slight "pea" aftertaste or graininess, but what powder isn't grainy? Anyway, all the ingredients in this product are healthy alternatives to other products out there. The natural flavor also allows you to add chocolate or fruit or any other flavor you choose to mix it up a little. A great addition to my morning breakfast.

review/summary: Kind of a life-saver
review/text: I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes and being a vegetarian, tofu and eggs were my only pure-protein options and I grew sick of those very soon. Discovered this protein powder and have been using it in my cooking ever since. I have added it to soups, stews, curries and smoothies. I am yet to try making rotis with it.  I prefer it cooked in my meal than in smoothies. It is better used with something that already has an overpowering taste. The product's website says it CAN be used in cooking, so I assume the nutrient value is not lost by doing so.<br /><br />I think it is a little high on sodium, but atleast it gives me more options in my food now. I have not tried any other protein powders, so I don't know how it rates compared to others in the market taste-wise.

review/text: This protein powder was quite good. However if you are used to sweets and proteins that taste like candy you will notice that this product is not sweet, but its not chalk dust either. I have used this protein in shakes and smoothies with fruit and without fruit and it didn't affect the taste of my food. My 14 year old daughter doesn't mind either (she's picky too!!!) This is a keeper for me I thought this was going to be like "other" protein powders I have tried that are vegan that taste like bitter crap but I was pleasently surprised this one is quite good it mixes well by the way not gritty at all !!!!!!!

review/text: The taste isn't great, but you can get used to it (I mix mine in water).  I am a vegan and I don't like eating a lot of soy (I think it may upset my stomach).  This product has 0 grams of sugar and only 4 grams of carbohydrates and is very low in fat, so you cannot expect it to taste DELICIOUS. There is 22 grams of protein per serving from non-soy vegetable sources, so 3 shakes a day for a work out routine plus snacks in between is a routine worth trying.

review/summary: Horrible taste
review/text: This product tastes horrible.  I was looking for a soy free protein and came upon this item.  I mixed it with soymilk and it tasted like pea-flavored chalk.  I thought I might have used too much powder so I tried half the amount of powder and it still tasted the same.  Not wanting to give up, I mixed in a scoop of strawberry flavored whey protein and it truly tasted like a combination of strawberry and chalk.<br /><br />My fiancee then tried it and couldn't take more than a sip.  In the end, I was able to down three cups of it, but I don't think I can drink any more in the future. I am going to take them up on their money back product guarantee.

review/summary: Amazons price is cheaper than anywhere around here
review/text: I don't really need to review Cheez-its, do I?  We all know what they're like.  D-lish!  I did want to comment about buying CheezIts from Amazon.com.  The price here is far cheaper than what any of my grocery stores or discount department stores offer.  With a discount and a coupon, I can get about the same price as here on Amazon.  But I don't always have a coupon and they're not always discounted... I have a Prime membership so shipping isn't a concern.  I did worry a bit about having a box of cracker crumbs... and that wasn't the case at all.  They were as intact as if I'd purchased them from the grocery store shelf.  If you're a fan of Cheez-Its, this is a pretty good way to keep them in your cupboard.

review/text: I don't mean that the product is bad, because it's not. Cheez-It's are always a good snack to munch on, and Amazon doesn't deliverer them old or anything.

It never stays the same.<br /><br />Either way, I'm not giving the product a bad review, just letting you guys know that if the product is more than $8, then wait for it to get back to $8 before purchasing.

review/text: Once I start eating a few of these, I begin to pray that I don't eat the whole box. Delicious, tangy, and long-lasting flavor. I usually don't have my prayers answered, but I begin to pray that I don't eat the next box in one shot! Once in a rare while, you'll get a box delivered that has some crakers broken into smaller pieces. Don't blame Amazon. The people who deliver the product don't exactly treat it like the Hope Diamond when they handle it, and Amazon usually makes it up to you in a fair way. I'm sure the crybabies who will "never" buy it again were reimbursed! In any case, don't weigh yourself for a few days if you do what I do (or eat a few more salads...). Never get tired of the taste. If you're lactose intolerant, be ready to wear a nose clip after you finish! Bon apetite!<br /><br />P.S. It is cheaper on Amazon than any supermarket I go to. As others have noted, even when the supermarket has a sale, it barely matches it. No need for me to use public transportation, no lost time. No-brainer!

I got my 4 boxes for $10.05 the price shot up to $10.37 a few days after I already purchased mines. Still a good deal thought since when they are on sale at the store they are $2.50 a box. So you are only paying a few extra cents. WARNING!!! Very addictive and cheesy! :)

review/summary: The one time it's okay to be cheezy...
review/text: At the current price, these are a great deal (4 boxes for about 11 dollars), so hopefully that won't change. Cheeze-It crackers are one of those snacks that I think you can have at (almost) any age. They have a perfect amount of cheddar taste, not going overboard but still giving it a perfect amount of flavor. The bite-sized crackers are very easy to take with you and a perfect snack on the go or to curb hunger until the next meal. Have them with your lunch, watching the ball game, after dinner, before lunch, whenever. At many stores, CheezeIts have skyrocketed in price ($4 a box), so this is a great deal if you are a "Cheeze It" fan.<br /><br />Great buy!

review/summary: Bitter
review/text: Chasing that wonderful Pumpkin Spice Latte' flavor I tried almost every conceivable concoction ... and I have learned a lot a long the way! First and foremost, the extra cost for the sauce vs the syrup is WELL worth it. The sauce offers a full bodied, truly genuine flavor that has no after taste or bitter residue - Whereas, this syrup is bitter regardless of the amount used. I can't imagine that muffins or coffee cakes would fair any better, however, I haven't tried cooking with this product so that is pure speculation. Bottom line, every time I put this syrup into a drink (cold or hot) it ruined it... completely!

review/summary: A healthier dessert alternative
review/text: Chocolate flavored granola, with dark chocolate chunks and dried red straweberries and raspberries?  That's what "Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries" offers you.  Below are my impressions on this product.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It's tasty.  I've eaten a fair amount of granola in my life, and flavoring it with chocolate actually makes it seem less granola-like, which is a good thing, if you know what I mean.  The granola has a nice chocolate flavor, not too strong and not too sweet.<br />- It's certified organic.  While I'm admittedly not an "all natural" kind of consumer and don't typically shop at organic food stores, I will buy (and pay more for) organic products when given a choice, provided they offer a similar taste.<br />- There are enough dark chocolate chunks to be noticible when you're eating, and they add to the positive experience<br /><br />Cons:<br />- There aren't enough dired red berries. While you can see a few small pieces in the mix, you can't readily taste them.<br />- It's a little high in calories, so portion control is essential if you're going to use this as part of your healthy eating patterns. An 11 1/2 ounce bag contains 10 servings, and each serving has 140 calories, about 40 percent is fat.  One or two servings at a time is fine, the whole bag is not.  :-)<br /><br />Overall, this is a good, tasty treat that is much better for you than cookies or ice cream and the like.  Just be sure to watch how much you eat.  Four starts.

review/summary: Good taste but too high calorie
review/text: This granola tastes really good.  It doesn't have enough berries nor pieces of chocolate but the flavor is not too overwhelmingly sweet.  The serving is 1/4 cup and has 140 calories.  I am not sure I'll be satisfied with just 1/4 cup since it tastes pretty good.  I shouldn't be surprised about the amount of calories considering that some of the ingredients have a high caloric number anyways, like: soy oil, spelt, choco chunks, flax seeds, and dried coconut.<br /><br />It does taste very good and it is organic.  It really makes a good snack and it's not too dry, just watch your calorie count.

review/summary: Wicked Good
review/text: A few years ago another company *koffkashikoff* introduced a chocolate granola which was so good and so addictive that a friend of mine began calling it "Satan Cereal," a name that has caught on with the rest of us.  So when Nature's Path Love Crunch came along, I had to try it and I can report that the bottom line is that it's pretty close in flavor and texture to Satan Cereal, though I think Love Crunch is marginally sweeter.  In other words, it's wicked good.  So with all things being equal in the taste department, who wins on points?<br /><br />Love Crunch contains a freeze-dried berry mix that the other brand doesn't.  It also has small squares of dark chocolate in the mix and both are pretty darn tasty.  It's an organic cereal, for those who feel that's important.  And the company that makes Love Crunch -- Nature's Path -- is donating money and food to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch that you buy.<br /><br />The nutritional facts, however, aren't quite as positive.  First off, a serving of Love Crunch is 1/4 C.  Measure that out; that's a very, very small amount of cereal, and possibly not enough to start your day on.  If you're snacking on the cereal, okay, but as the central focus of the most important meal of the day?  It's a little thin.  By comparison, the other cereal is a 1/2 C serving which is more realistic, and so I'm going to make a side-by-side nutritional comparison based on 1/2 C of each cereal or a double serving of Love Crunch vs a single serving of the other cereal.<br /><br />At half a cup, Love Crunch (Hereafter referred to as LC) weighs in at a whopping 280 calories compared to 230 calories for the other cereal (Hereafter referred to as OC.) OC has 80 calories from fat, LC has 110.  LC wins on sodium @ 110 mg vs OC's 140 mg per serving.  Where OC really pulls ahead is in the dietary fiber sweepstakes with a whopping 7 grams of fiber to LC's 4 grams.<br /><br />Finally, if you buy from Amazon.com, LC will cost you $0.33 per ounce vs LC's $0.30 per ounce.  As you can see, in terms of price and nutrition, there's not that much to choose between the two cereals, so if you favor the flavor of one over the other, I'd say stick to it.  Since I love both, I'm going with the slightly cheaper, slightly less sweet one that has a bit better nutritional profile on a reasonable-size serving.  If you're able to get by on 1/4 C and like your cereals on the sweeter side, then by all means, choose Love Crunch. Either way you'll be looking at a tasty morning meal.

review/summary: Dangerously good
review/text: This granola is almost too good.  The oat clusters are mostly all in the 1/2 inch range and they taste exceptionally good - definitely a natural, homemade taste.  The chocolate pieces in the granola are outstanding.  They are actually really good tasting semi-sweet dark chocolate, not artificial tasting at all, and there are a lot of them.  The only thing that I could say was slightly disappointing is that there weren't very many berries in our bag.  It may have just been this particular bag, but I definitely wish there had been more of them because they were just as delicious as the oats and the chocolate.<br /><br />I don't think you can go wrong in purchasing this for any occasion.  We ate it right out of the bag, but I can imagine it would be just delicious in yogurt, over ice cream or with milk for breakfast.

review/text: This is great plain or in a bowl with milk (and it didn't get soggy when I ate it as cereal).  More chocolate and berries would push this into a 5-star granola.  At first I thought my package was somehow missing the chocolate and berries because they'd all settled to the bottom and there weren't very many to begin with.  I was much happier with my second serving that included more of the perfectly sized mini-chocolate bars and the tiny bits of freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  I loved the flavor of the chocolate, but the berries weren't too noticeable given how small they were.

review/summary: Delicious "Dessert-like" Granola
review/text: Oh Holy Granola, Batman! This granola is basically dessert. It has granola that is basically lightly covered in cocoa, mini dark chocolate bars, and freeze dried strawberries and raspberries. The granola pieces are mostly pretty pulverized (possibly a result of the product coming in a bag, but the pieces are pretty small regardless), but there are some larger chunks of granola. The cocoa flavor on the granola is not overwhelming or overly sweet, but rather just a perfect amount of flavor added. The miniature chocolate bars are a delightful addition and a wonderful little treat when you get to them. I didn't have much opinion on the strawberries and raspberries, though; they didn't really taste like much other than chocolate once all was said and done. I don't like my granola in milk, so I just ate it by the handful and in some yogurt and thought it was great both ways. The other day I took a snack bag full of it to work for a snack.<br /><br />I love the fact that the company matches sales with donations to food banks up to $1 million. It is nice to see globally conscious companies trying to help the world fight hunger. Add that to yummy granola and you have me as a loyal customer! (PS Now I have to hide it from my husband or he eats it all and I get none... never had to fight him for granola before!).

I could probably eat an entire bag in one sitting, it's that good.<br /><br />It's also cheaper than the regular price of some of the store brands, which have larger boxes but often a lighter weight.

review/summary: Not quite Premium
review/text: If you love granola, you'll love this cocoa-flavored one from Nature's Path.  It has a very nice cocoa intensity and chunky pieces of dark chocolate.  It's also not cloying in sweetness, which I find off-putting in some granola. It contains some pieces big enough to snack on but it's also lovely with milk.  However, the red berries are almost non-existent.  I've eaten half the bag already and only gotten 3 measly pieces of spongy strawberry that were smaller than green peas. I can barely taste it.  For almost $4 a bag, I expect to see red berries when the package says red berries.  It would have been perfect otherwise.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- delicious<br />- made of whole grains, 0 g. of transfat, low sodium, cholesterol-free<br />- certified organic and non-GMO (made in a kitchen, not a lab)<br />- Nature's Path promises to donate up to $1 million dollars to food banks for every bag of Love Crunch bought.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not nearly enough red berries<br />- a bit pricey<br />- serving size is a minuscule 1/4 cup but has 140 calories and 55 of those from fat<br />- produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts, and tree nuts so people with allergies - beware!

review/summary: Satisfying Crunch
review/text: Nature's Path Love Crunch Premium Organic Granola, Dark Chocolate and Red Berries = Good stuff.  I like granola on occasion (not on a daily consumption basis).  Usually I buy a local brand that has nuts and raisins and chocolate bits in it.  The variety I am reviewing here has cocoa, chocolate bits and some freeze-dried strawberries and raspberries.  It's good out of the bag and should be a nice treat on top of yogurt or ice cream.<br /><br />The price per ounce is quite a good value and less than what I pay here at the store.<br /><br />It's not sweet.  I would say the dominant flavor is the oats, and they are listed number one in ingredients, with evaporated cane juice, soy oil, spelt, dark chocolate chunks, flax seeds, dried coconut, cocoa, freeze-dried berries, rice starch, sea salt, natural chocolate flavor, natural vanilla flavor and tocopherols (Natural vitamin E) following.  I'm not a health-food nut, so I cannot comment on any of the ingredients.<br /><br />I could not taste the coconut.  I could taste the cocoa slightly, especially with the first taste.<br /><br />I would have to say, though, that after naming their product flavor as "Dark Chocolate and Red Berries," the manufacturers were too stingy with the berries.  The berry bits are too small, too few and too far between.  Any granola needs something to liven it up.<br /><br />I would recommend this product.  Add more berries and it would even better.

review/summary: Tasty, ethical...could use more raspberries
review/text: I've never met a combination of dark chocolate and raspberries that I didn't like, and Love Crunch does not disappoint. This new Nature's Path blend is a really tasty combination of sweetened rolled oats, tart freeze-dried strawberry and raspberry bits, and chunks of high quality dark chocolate. The granola is not too sweet, perfectly crunchy, and ideal for eating straight out of the bag, on top of yogurt, or even ice cream. For whatever reason, it doesn't seem to chew up the roof of my mouth the way other granolas have in the past. I do wish there were more berries -- good thing the granola has plenty of character and flavor on its own. Each 30g serving has 14g of whole grains and a modest 6g of sugars (the 'evaporated cane juice' listed second in the ingredients is basically sugar, by the way).<br /><br />If you're the crunchy type (and I am), you'll be glad to know that Love Crunch is certified organic and has a very clean ingredient list. I'd love it even more if the bag were recyclable / compostable and the chocolate were fair trade, but am happy to find that Nature's Path donates to food banks for every bag purchased, up to $1 million. I'm not usually a big granola eater, but I'd happily buy more Love Crunch.

review/text: This granola is great -it has a fun theme (raspberries and chocolate), nice packaging, a delicious taste, and an inviting crunch.<br /><br />It didn't have a high chocolate ratio (as I might have expected with the packaging), but when considering that this product really is trying to be granola, and not a candy crunch dessert (like a chocolate covered granola bar), then it is fine.  The chocolate bits were small squares, and they seemed to be of good quality (and not chalky like some cheaper candies).<br /><br />I was impressed with the maker of this product, Nature's Path, and I will definitely be seeking out their other creations.<br /><br />Oh yeah, three more things to like: it contains flax seeds (which are one of the best way to get Omega-3 oils without eating fish), it is completely organic, and the company gives an equivalent amount of food to food banks for every product purchased.  If this is true it gives me one more reason to like them.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.

review/summary: Decadent Granola
review/text: Who knew that granola could be described as decadent? I sure didn't, until I tried this one. The dark chocolate flavor combined with the berries and the crunchy granola....yummy! My problem is not knowing when to stop eating it, I finished this off (myself) in two days, 98% of the granola I ate straight out of the bag. I tried a handful tossed in low fat vanilla yogurt, not quite as good as eating it plain IMHO.<br /><br />One thing you need to watch - if you order this in hot weather, the chocolate will melt; it was 74 degrees the day this arrived, not really all that hot, and when I opened the bag it was pretty messy from the melted chocolate.

review/summary: Addictive
review/text: This stuff is really addictive.  I usually don't have time to eat during work.  I like to take granola to pour into a cup and gulp down as I work.  I can't stop eating it.  The granola by itself is great.  Add the dark chocolate (just the right amount of sweetness) and strawberries and it's awesome.

review/summary: Not a Health Food Fan
review/text: I'll be fully frank: I'm not a health food fan. I tend to avoid things that say "organic" on them like the plague. Not that I eat only junk, but in my experience a lot of things that are labeled as health food simply don't taste edible.<br /><br />I was very skeptical that this granola would be healthy and delicious, but I was wrong! How good is Love Crunch? I had to pry it away from my kids AND my husband just to get a taste!!<br /><br />What sets Love Crunch apart is two things: the fruit bits and the chocolate bits. The chocolate is delicious! Dark chocolate pieces that taste as chocolate should. Very yummy! The fruit pieces shocked me because many of them are tiny, but they pack a huge punch when you put one in your mouth.<br /><br />The only downside to this bag is that both my husband and I wished for more chocolate and more fruit pieces. The granola was delicious, however, and almost tasted like it was a crunchy no-bake chocolate cookie that had been smashed up.<br /><br />We were definitely surprised by this granola and are going to be ordering more!

review/summary: Delicious Granola From a Good Company
review/text: Before opening the bag, I read the back and I like what I read. Organic and non-GMO from a company that gives back.<br /><br />That's a good start, but means nothing if the resulting product is inferior. Nature's Path got this one right. This is one of the best granolas I've tasted! The clusters and loose bits of granola have nice crunchy chocolate flavor without being overpowering. The real chocolate bits are of a good quality, and while small, they compliment the crunchy bits perfectly. The only minus is that the freeze-dried red berries are few and far between, and the bits that are there are small.<br /><br />I snacked on it dry and mixed it with yogurt, so it lasted for almost two days. With my morning yogurt alone I might get four servings from a bag, but as a snack I would say there was one serving per bag. It's that addicting. They don't even need the "Best By" date on the back of the bag...it will never last that long!<br /><br />I feel that, at just under four bucks a bag here on Amazon as of this writing, this is a guilty pleasure I can indulge in now and again.<br /><br />Final Score: 4.75 (Rounded up to 5)

review/summary: Great taste, low sodium, and organic, could use a little more chocolate and berries
review/text: This is good tasting granola. The granola itself is crunchy but not too dry by granola standards, and filling. The dark chocolate is very good quality. The berries are tasty and not sweet at all but add a little acid.<br /><br />If you get a handfull of granola with both together that is a good combo. But the bag is mostly granola and that doesn't happen too often. Nonetheless, the overal product is still very good, healthy, and good value for organic and low sodium. A good snack to try that you can feel good about. Recommended.

review/summary: Very good granola mix
review/text: It tastes as good as the packaging makes it look! I love that there is a mission behind the brand to provide for food banks. I usually don't like dark chocolate so I was surprised that I like the chocolate squares so much. Maybe I've been eating the wrong dark chocolate. The strawberries didn't do much for me but that's ok. The only thing I didn't like was that more than half of the granola on the bottom of the bag was crushed and no longer in bite size pieces. This may have just been from all of the shipping though. Overall very good, tastes great.

review/summary: Delicious, wholesome food with a conscience
review/text: I love, love, love this granola.  It tastes so sinful, but it's actually good for you.  (But one caution, a serving size of � cup is 140 calories, and it's easy to get carried away eating this!) It's the perfect snack for when your sweet tooth is acting up.  The granola itself has a hint of cocoa and a soft whisper of coconut which is tasty, but not overpowering.  The berries add a tiny bit of tartness that balances well with the sweet richness of the chocolate.  I did wish that there had been more dark chocolate chunks, but this is more reflective of my own chocolate addiction than any deficit in the product.  It's delicious eaten plain, but would also be great over ice cream or yogurt.<br /><br />I also really like to know that I'm eating something from a company that grows organically, and donates to food banks with each purchase.  The ingredients are all natural, I know what everything is in the ingredient list and can pronounce it all.  Good, nutritious food from a socially and environmentally responsible company--I'm sold.

review/summary: "Best treat EVER"
review/text: Our office has a rotation schedule of weekly treats.  I used this Love Crunch granola to top some fruit and yogurt parfaits.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  The granola added the perfect crunch and the dark chocolate chunks added a touch of decadence to my healthy snack.  A bonus was that it didn't contain any raisins, so commonly found in granola. Raisins send one of my bosses screaming for the hills due to some deep seated childhood incident.  But I digress....<br /><br />Anyway the parfaits were a total hit, being described as "rockin' good" and "best treat ever".  Thanks, Nature's Path for helping me suck up to my bosses!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

review/summary: One of the best tasting granolas I have tried (dark chocolate and red berries)
review/text: Received the dark chocolate and red berries version. From a nutritional standpoint it was a good choice having very low sugar amounts compared to a lot of granola and cereal products (6 grams). The fat content is up a bit a 6 grams as well but only 1 of those is saturated. Everything is listed as being organic and chemical free.<br /><br />Tastewise this version is outstanding. In milk it reminds me of chocolate oatmeal christmas cookies. The chocolate chunks taste great and the berries are slightly noticeable and add great flavor. This is by far the best bagged granola I have ever tried and I go through a lot (I like to put them in plain greek yogurt as well as in milk).<br /><br />It is priced very competatively as well.<br /><br />Fat: 6g (1g saturated, 3g poly unsaturated, 1.5 grams monunsaturated)<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 55mg<br />Potassium: 105mg<br />Total Carbohydrates: 20g (Fiber 2g, Sugars 6g)<br />Protein: 2g

review/summary: Real berries and real chocolate - delicious!
review/text: I fell in love with Love Crunch at the first bite!  I have had many flavored granola products and some even contained bits of berries, but I have never before had one that contained whole dried berries as well as actual chunks of chocolate.  The taste was so great that I was absolutely sure it had to be terrible for me, but that isn't the case at all.  For Dark Chocolate and Red Berries blend, the serving size is 1/4 cup and each serving has 140 calories (55 from fat), 6g fat (1g saturated), 0mg cholesterol, 55mg sodium, 105mg potassium, 20g carbs, and 2g protein.  It felt very decadent on yogurt or even just eaten alone.  Altogether it was an excellent treat!

review/summary: Yummy snack with everything I want...
review/text: Love Crunch is just delicious. Granola bits with dried strawberries and chunks of chocolate -- I don't know really how healthy it is, but it makes an excellent snack. Forgot breakfast? Love Crunch. Have coffee but nothing to eat with it except dried apricots? Love Crunch. Need something to keep in your car so you don't starve during a day at school? Love Crunch.<br /><br />I would caution against using it as a cereal, though. I tried, with Soy Milk, and it tasted pretty good at first, but you've got to be quick because once those strawberries get wet... they just don't taste very good. The texture is a bit slimy. Of course you can pick out the strawberries and throw them in as you go.<br /><br />Trying it with ice cream is certainly going to be my next step, though yoghurt sounds pretty good too. The combination of elements makes the treat interesting, you get soft and chewy, slight bitter slight sweet, fruity and chocolate. It's one of the best dried snacks I've had.
