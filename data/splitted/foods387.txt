review/summary: Best preserves by far
review/text: These are the absolute best Strawberry Preserves I have ever eaten. One time the store was out of stock of this brand and I had to buy another brand of strawberry preserves. I ended up throwing the jar away after eating only half of the product. That is how much better Bonne Maman is than other brands. I also absolutely love that it contains no corn syrup of any kind.

review/summary: Delicious strawberry jelly
review/text: I purchased this after trying the raspberry jelly and I love both flavors.  It is so tasty and uses real fruit and sugar and that is all.  This is one of the best jelly's I have ever had.  It is fresh and not over processed, and the color of the jelly is true to the fruit color.  Thank you Amazon for providing top of the line products.

review/summary: Amazing preserves, just a tad too sweet
review/text: (These'd be ranked 4.5 if possible.)<br /><br />Holy crap, this preserve is amazing~!<br />They taste just like fresh out of the orchard strawberries, with a little extra sugar. If they got rid of one of the sugar sources, or reduced it by a touch, this would be hands down, one of the best fruit spreads I've ever eaten.

review/text: This Strawberry preserves has the best flavor I have ever experienced.  The texture is great and toast or bisquits taste fantastic with this product.  The spreading consistancy is also a plus and I am very glad to have bought several jars of Strawberry as well as the wonderful Raspberry offered.  I will certainly order again.

review/summary: Good but not Great -
review/text: I thought I really got a great deal on these preserves until a week ago when my local Chicago area Italian Cheese store and Green Grocer ran a special on all flavors for $2.00 each. Caputo's, my local store, doesn't usually carry this brand and must have gotten an advantageous buy because $2.00 is an exceptional price.<br /><br />The strawberry is good, spreads easily but is a little runny. A good strawberry taste but my favorite is the raspberry. The labels are easy to remove and then the jars are great to reuse to store leftovers in the fridge.<br /><br />As with most imported jams, jellies and preserves Bonne Maman uses sugar and not high Fructose corn syrup. The label lists sugar and cane sugar so we don't know the specifics.

review/summary: Did the importer swap the contents?
review/text: The bottle I was unlucky enough to sample was imported by Moet Hennesy. I'm curious if the importer swapped the contents of the bottle. It must be that or Ardbeg has the best hype machine on the planet.<br /><br />The initial aroma is that of rubbing alcohol with a hint of fusel alcohol, although my friend likes the aroma. On tasting, it doesn't have much flavor. The aftertaste is another story entirely. It's hard to describe. Initially it's just a hint of medicine that progresses to a NyQuil type flavor and then on to.... something.<br /><br />I've had peaty flavored scotch but I cannot recommend... whatever that was.

review/summary: These are, um, interesting.
review/text: I ordered a bunch of these in order to help crave my salty/crunchy cravings given the fact that I'm trying to limit my carb intake.  It's particularly the high-carb empty calories I need to cut out like grains and potatoes.  Well, there goes about 99% of all of the yummy snack foods on the market.<br /><br />Now I gave these a try not expecting much, and I have found that they are extremely interesting.  They are definitely not for everyone, but I found that they did satiate my salty/crunchy cravings.  The texture takes some getting used to, though.  And it helps that I really like cheese.<br /><br />I'm throwing a 3 out of five stars up there.  They are good enough so that I will try other flavors, but they aren't exactly the most delicious snak food ever, either.  I mean, I'd much rather have a plate of nachos or a bag of potato chips, but this will suffice for now.<br /><br />EDIT:  After eating these for a few days, I'm upping my rating to four stars.  The more I eat them, the more I like them.  In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that I even crave them.  I can't wait to try some of the other flavors.  Honey dijon and bacon are the two I'm most looking forward to.

review/summary: Low carb cheesy snack- a must try
review/text: I'd had these many years ago, and hadn't seen them. I was SO glad to find them again.  They are just baked cheese- nothing else. The flavor is intensely cheesy, and a bit on the salty side- but something I'll buy again.  Outstanding for those with carbohydrate restrictions (hey, diabetics- I'm one of you, and finding these to be just right for that salty snack urge). I also like the portion control.  :)  BUY THEM !!!

review/summary: Different & Tasty
review/text: I first saw this snack item on the tv show "unwrapped" and became determined to find them and try them. When I first saw the package I was surprised at how small the packaging was, then when I opened it and popped one into my mouth I understood why. While tasty and non-greasy to the touch, I could not finish the package off the way I would a bag of chips or popcorn. After A few bites, I began to feel a little heaviness in my stomach. I put the bag down and went back to it later. on my second attempt I began to feel the same thing. Maybe it was the grease/fat (although it does not appear greasy) from the baked cheese, I'm not sure. Everytime I went to bag after a few bites I got this same feeling in my stomach. I let other people try them and they liked the taste and crunchy texture but I noticed no one finished one of the 0.5 oz bags. Maybe it is my stomach that is sensitive to them that greasy/full feeling was enough to keep me fron ordering them again, but they tasted really good. Maybe I have a sensitive stomach. Enjoy them!

review/summary: One of the few low carb snacks I buy
review/text: Being on a low carb diet is not too difficult, but I crave something crunchy every now and then that isn't bacon or nuts.  These cheese snacks are very portable and are satisfying for a quick bite.  I have tried several baked cheese snacks and prefer this one over all the rest.  My only complaint is that a package can contain quite a few over-baked rounds. With there only being a handful in each small package anyway, there is not much left over to eat.  I dislike the burnt flavor of the ones that are overcooked, so I throw them away.  Some packages contain all perfectly cooked rounds and it's a yummy treat.  When I get a bag with lots of over-baked ones I feel I'm not getting my money's worth.

review/text: These are very tasty little snacks for those who don't need to watch their sodium intake.  They taste like the crispy bits of melted cheese around the edges of a grilled cheese sandwich.  The little serving size bags are much smaller than I expected--about the size of a pocket size pack of tissues--but this is good, as they fit right in my purse and the better half's briefcase or laptop bag.  We'll definitely try the other flavors.

review/summary: Merely okay
review/text: Some people really get into the Just the Cheese snacks, but I think they're just okay.  They *are* crispy and salty, but there's something odd about the texture.  Like a flattened dried chunk of styrofoam.  And they don't taste particularly good, either.  There's no real jalapeno flavor, nor do they taste like cheese.  Sort of a nondescript crunchy thing.  But if you're low-carbing it and jonesing for a crunchy snack to munch on, they're better than diving into a bag of Fritos.  I like the popped cheese better - probably because those are much saltier and crunchier, so they satisfy me with just a couple of bites.  However Just the Cheese, like the popped cheese, can be turned into croutons or floated in soup to give it some texture.<br /><br />It's kind of the snack equivalent of Totino's pizza - crap food that sometimes just hits the spot.

I liked the plainer flavors (white cheddar and Wisconsin cheddar), they just taste like cheese.  The more unusual flavors (pizza, nacho) seem saltier and artificial tasting.  If you always scrape the little baked on bits of cheese off aluminum foil and baking sheets, give it a try!

review/summary: Pretty good but very little for the price.
review/text: These are pretty good, but you've gotta realize that each pack is the size of a pack of peanuts.  A lot of the space in each bag is air.  I suppose it is to keep the puffs from breaking.<br /><br />Flavorwise, they're alright.  Cheesy, crunchy, and a bit too salty to eat a lot of.  They're not amazing though.  You could probably get more concentrated flavor by baking your own cheese, but the problem is of course time.  This is very light flavored.

review/summary: Cheese droppings
review/text: Yuck. I'd use a more colorful title for this review than "cheese droppings" that means the same thing but rhymes with "cheese curds" but am not sure that'd make it past Amazon's content policies.<br /><br />You know how if you're baking a pizza or something and some of the cheese falls off and lands directly on the pan, then overcooks into a hard, crunchy, oily salt lick? Yeah, that's what these are. They're strongly flavored to hide the underlying horror. It doesn't help.<br /><br />I should admit that I'm not this product's target audience. I was just looking for a tasty snack, not realizing that these are intended for people on ultra-low-carb diets. But if you want to get 100% of your snack calories from fat, might I suggest pork rinds? They've got a pleasant bacon-y taste and are not foul abominations like these are. Or if pork rinds aren't to your taste, perhaps you could try drinking used motor oil. I'm pretty sure that doesn't have any carbs either, and can't taste much worse.<br /><br />I see that a few reviewers have said things that weren't entirely negative. Well, everybody's entitled to an opinion, and theirs is wrong. I'm stuck with a bunch of this garbage and I don't know what to do with it. I'd send them to my worst enemy, but I don't hate him all _that_ much.

review/summary: Low in Carbs, High in Sodium!
review/text: Be careful!  The low carbs get you, but if you have a problem with sodium, realize the content is high!  I have been buying these "crunchy cheese snacks" in Classic White Cheddar for a couple of years.  I was originally drawn by the low carbs per serving bag.  The 1/2 oz bag says "1 g".  I bought them by the box of 16 packs.  I used "subscribe and save" and started buying 4 boxes of 16 - 1/2 oz bags, per month. That's 64 of these 1/2 oz bags each month.  They are also available in 2 oz bags. Plus, they grow on you.  Literally.  I knew, but didn't take into consideration the high sodium - 275mg per 1/2oz bag - until recently.  A rep at the company told me they were working to cut the sodium content.  I hope it happens, soon.  I won't buy any more until they do. I like that they are also Gluten-Free.  It's just too much sodium for a little bag and people should be aware of it.

There were only a few whole pieces in the bag and a couple of crumbs. Someone was not packing based on weight that day. I will eat real cheese any day. It is more filling to eat a chunk of real cheese. Plus real white cheddar can be left non-refrigerated for up to two weeks and still be safe to eat! Just call Mars Cheese Castle and ask them all about it.

review/summary: Terrible
review/text: There are few foods I don't like, but I couldn't get these down. I can't begin to describe how terrible they taste and how unappetizing the texture is. Unfortunately, I bought them in several flavors and each one I opened was worse than the one before. I begged my co-workers to take them off my hands but no one would eat them. I even offered five bucks to whoever would eat a bag of them and no one could do it -- and I work in an office of cheapskakes who never met free food they didn't like. Don't buy these.<br /><br />If you want a no-carb crispy cheese snack put a thin layer of shredded cheese on a plate and microwave it for roughly 2 minutes. Keep checking so you don't burn it but let bubble up and get crispy. Much much much much much better than these nasty freaky cheese thingies.

review/text: These little cheese crisps taste like toasted cheese.  My favourite part of making anything with melted cheese is the little bits that get brown and crunchy - and that's what these taste like.  They are low in carbs and anyone who is on a low carb diet knows that once in a while you crave a crunchy snack.  They are salty, but I don't eat anything else that is high in sodium so I figure a 2 oz bag isn't going to hurt me.

review/summary: Yummy, weird, salty, and high in fat... but I like them!
review/text: I would give these 3 and 1/2 stars if I could. Now that I have tried these I see why there are so many "mixed" reviews. To start: they are NOT "healthy". Yes, they are low in carbs, but for the total calories from fat (60 out of 75) - the percentage is WAY too high. That means the calories are 80% from fat. Yes, I realize they are made of cheese, which is mostly fat, but they are not something I want to be eating all day every day. (Kind of like the 100-calorie pack treats that are portion controlled, but not so "healthy" either.) Plus, they are high in sodium like most other people have pointed out. However, they are very low in carbs (1 gram) and high in protein (5 grams). I got the "Classic White Cheddar Cheese". Keep in mind that white cheddar is one of my all-time favorite cheeses. The texture is crunchy - similar to a rice cake (a little denser). The one thing that I strongly DON'T like, is the weird, greasy, oily feeling it leaves on my teeth. But maybe that is just me. But the flavor is fine. The packaging states the following:<br /><br />1 bag (0.5 oz.) - 14 grams:<br /><br />Calories: 75<br />Calories from fat: 60<br />Total fat - 6.5g (10% Daily Value [DV])<br />Cholesterol - 25mg (8% DV)<br />Sodium - 275mg (12% DV)<br />Total carbs - 1g (0% DV)<br />Protein - 5 g<br />Vitamin A - 5% DV<br />Calcium - 16% DV<br /><br />The size of the bag reminds me of those little pouches of fruit gummies that they make for kids lunches.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent tasting, low carb, high fat snack. Not something I will eat every day, but a nice "treat" when I am in the mood for something salty and crunchy.

review/summary: Great crunch on a diet, but watch that salt!
review/text: If you are watching your carbs, this is a great little snack, it's what it says it is... baked cheese. It's actually pretty good, but very salty.<br /><br />They come in these little bowl shaped discs about the size of a nickle in little 1/2 ounce bags. Great for control of what you are eating so you don't just pour a big bowl of them (and because they are so salty). They are super crunchy but disintegrate in your mouth pretty quickly.<br /><br />So far, I've tried the Wisconsin Cheddar and the White Cheddar version. The white cheddar is basically the same, just has a little more "bite" to it. I'll be looking at the lower salt and popped versions soon to change it up a little and maybe cut some of the salt.<br /><br />Worth a try if you are low carb or if you just want something a little more healthy than chips - they are pretty low calorie per bag as well, but the bags are pretty small. They satisfy my mid-day crunch cravings though!

Each mini round is about the size of a nickel and there aren't all that many in a bag. I bought the Classic White Cheddar ones, which I found to be very yummy.

review/text: Okay, let me start by saying that these snacks will really appeal to those who have had some sort of bariatric surgery.  At only 75 calories, 5 grams of protein and 1 gram of carbs per serving I cannot think of a healthier salty "treat" to indulge in.  The package is very small only 1/2 an oz so its a good size for those of us who can only eat very small portions.  The taste is very much like the crunchy cheese that gets stuck to a pizza pan.  I have only tried the "grilled cheese" flavor which doesn't have any additional flavoring powder on it so I think it is less salty than other versions of this snack.  I will be ordering them again, for sure!

review/summary: Delicious, but a little salty
review/text: Like other reviewers have said, these are a little salty, but if you have your snack with a drink, the saltiness isn't so bothersome.  Otherwise, they have an AMAZING flavor and provide a satisfying crunch.  Also, it's a good source of calcium if don't drink milk.

review/summary: will not re-order
review/text: I was expecting something better than what arrived. The serving size within the bag contains 4 mini (and I mean mini) rounds and a couple of crumbs. the flavor was okay, nothing to rave about. I have eaten baked cheese before and this is nothing like the real thing. After eating one pack as a snack, I was still hungry. I would have been better off eating cheese curds or cutting a chunk of cheese for the same amount of calories and more satisfaction. i won't be buying these again, even though they come from my home state.

review/summary: Low Carb Snack, High Sodium
review/text: I got these when I was on the Atkins diet as a snack. They are very cheesy, and very very salty. At first they were delicious , especially after eating low carb for a few weeks. They have a great crunch, and are lightly seasoned. But after 4-5 bags they started to make me nauseous, just to rich and salty. The bags are very small, but since the chips/pucks are so rich I couldn't imagine eating more then whats in each bag in one serving.

review/summary: Great snack for VGS patients!!
review/text: I was looking for something crunchy, salty and low carb after my vertical gastric sleeve.  These are amazing.  I am one of those people who prefer the burnt cheese from a casserole or grilled cheese, so these were appealing based on that preference.  I shared them with coworkers.  The other cheese-lover couldn't get enough.  Another co-worker hated them.  Another plus was that it is hard to get through the entire bag before filling up (but, I'm post-op bariatric surgery).  They may be a little pricey, but to me they are worth it.

review/text: I was a bit hesitant buying something in bulk that I had never tried, but these are positively delicious.  Now my only concern is eating all of them too fast.  They have about 75 calories per package and are comparable to a string cheese except they feel more like a "treat" because they are crunchy and salty too.  Love them.

review/summary: Crunchy, cheesy, salty, deliciousness
review/text: I just adore these snacks!  I've only tried white cheddar so far but am coming back to try another flavor.  I bought them when doing Atkins, at just 1 carb per serving, yet crunchy and tasty, it was quite a nutritional bargain!  Now I've switched to Weight Watchers and these yummy little gems are only 2 points plus per pack.  There may be an acquired-taste period for the first pack, but it passes quickly. I can not say enough about Just the Cheese; whenever I get a craving to reach for high fat, high carb snacks (chips, buttered popcorn, whatever), I reach for these and I am satisfied without breaking the budget.  Love them.

review/text: Thank goodness these are available--they're the perfect snacks for low-carbers! Recently discovered they're also good for bariatric surgery patients--a post-surgical friend who travels for work picked up a package of mine, read the nutritional info, and said it would fit into her plan.  It's difficult to find high-protein snacks that are easily portable for a briefcase or carry-on bag in case of getting stuck on a delayed flight with nothing available that she could eat (which has happened more than she would like!)

The portioning is good and they satisfy me.

review/text: I snack on these when I'm craving chips.  These are the only things that really quiet down that craving.  Maybe it is all the sodium/salt  - I don't know.  But I've bought so many of the atkins snacks, and although many are good, this (a non atkins product) is the only low-carb food I have that I reach for when I really feel like cheating.

review/text: I had high hopes for these. I mean, crunchy cheese, what's not to love?  But they have more of a "processed" taste than I would have liked.  I found myself having trouble finishing the tiny half ounce bag.  I gave them a fair chance, kept an open mind, but after three bags I'm going to have to find someone to give the rest to.  The flavor is definitely more salt than cheese.  Perhaps the other flavors would be better but since it was a pure love of cheese that lead to the purchase, I'm really not interested in trying any of the other flavors.  Oh well, it was worth a try.
