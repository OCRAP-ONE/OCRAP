review/summary: Add it to your Manhattan!
review/text: Bought this to add to a recipe by Jason Schiffer for a Maple Manhattan.  It's a great bitters and played really well with the Bourbon and Maple Syrup I was using.  Great product!  As with any bottle of bitters, 4 oz. is going to last you a LONG, LONG time so this is a great value as well.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the Fee Brothers bitters!  Have fun with them and experiment!

review/summary: Could be better
review/text: This was my first time trying Fee's Whisky Barrel-Aged bitters. I was somewhat disappointed that they do not contain any alcohol. In that way they feel different when compared with other bitters, and I feel that more is needed in cocktails. They are predominantly cinnamon-flavored and do not feel as complex as I expected - I was expecting perhaps more of a charred oak flavor. Overall they are not bad, and I can certainly find some use for them, but they are priced fairly high, and I personally still prefer Angostura bitters in my Manhattans and Old Fashioneds.

review/summary: The best halva is the best!
review/text: Imported from Istanbul, Turkey, Koska halva is absolutely the best and completely outdoes the competition. Personally I prefer the pistachio or chocolate varities to the plain, but all three taste wonderful. The plastic containers keep it nice and fresh. A word to the wise: this Middle Eastern treat is so outrageously good that it is hard to stop eating it. Cut yourself a quarter-inch thick slice and then put the container away immediately, otherwise you will yield to the temptation of cutting more and more slices. Also, try to control yourself and eat it once a day. Needless to say, halva goes great with strong Turkish coffee and the two together will give you quite a burst of energy. The only way you could do better than Koska is to get real homemade halva which not easily available. Enjoy!

review/text: This stuff was so bitter, i got goosebumps and shudders. I also bought some rose flavored turkish delight and same reaction. Seriously, how do they manage over there? I read reviews about this Halva being SO GOOD that you have to restrain yourself from eating it in one fell swoop. I really can't see that happening. I can see it going into the trash tho if no one else in the house will eat it. Also it was nearly impossible to just slice up as it fell apart in crumbles.

review/summary: dense, moist snack bar
review/text: These are very dense, moist snack bars; could even be a meal replacement if you're up for something smallish. There's actually 5 flavors of these, but I believe only this one (Banana Walnut) and the Chocolate Chip one are available right now (and I can't recommend the Chocolate Chip one, it does not taste good to me). I look forward to trying the Brownie and Peanut Butter versions, as well as the Cranberry one. But these are excellent.<br />Each bar contains 5g fiber, 12g whole grain, and 6g of protein. More info on this product and their other things at [...]. I only just heard of this company the other week when a relative gave me one of their bars, but their products look great (if a bit pricey; but high-quality costs more).<br />Update: these are all made much better by warming them up: remove from package, and heat them for 10-15 seconds in the microwave. Makes them smoother and softer, like soft cookies just out of the oven.

review/summary: Perfect for travel
review/text: [Corazonas Banana Walnut Oatmeal Squares -- reviewed a few weeks after buying them.]<br /><br />For years I've carried food-bars to eat when my blood sugar gets low, and for years I've had to deal with two kinds of bars:  the kind that are gooey with frosting or with chocolate chips that have melted in the heat; or the kind which are crunchy and crumbly.  In either case I'd have a mess on my fingers, or on my shirt, or on the furniture.<br /><br />These oatmeal squares are neither gooey or crumbly.  Instead they have a soft firm texture that's just what I want for travel.  (I can't say the same for the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003EXI9OO">CORAZONAS Oatmeal Squares, Chocolate Chip, 1.76-Ounce bags (pack of 12)</a>, since the chocolate chips can get messy.)  They're also the right size to slip into a pocket.<br /><br />As for taste, they're pleasant, but they seem a bit bland to me, perhaps because they're low sodium.  However, taste is not my main concern when I want "fuel" to bring my blood sugar back up.

review/summary: cause migraines, otherwise very good
review/text: I get a constant, mild headache and poor sleep (too many dreams) from these.  And my mom gets full-on migraines.  We think it's the "whey protein isolate" ingredient because we've had this problem before with other energy bars.  Except for my headaches and poor sleep, I think these are awesome -- I have lots of energy, don't crave coffee and don't feel the need to eat all day.  Banana Walnut and Chocolate Brownie are the best.  Cranberry Flax is pretty good.  Chocolate chip tastes bad.  I didn't try peanut butter.  Too bad they don't work for me.  But if they for you, then kudos.<br /><br />My dad loved these, but then they made him dizzy and he drove the car into the side of the garage and knocked off the side view mirror.  His blood pressure had shot up from these.  Also, he started getting mild headaches, and he never gets headaches.

review/text: This is a great quick snack or on-the-run breakfast bar. These bars are actually pretty tasty and accurately described. The banana walnut actually tasted like banana oatmeal bar and actually contained walnuts pieces. Texturally, it is fairly fibrous (hence the oats), but not overly so. Only complaint is that the size is on the smaller size, but that is more a personal preference.

review/summary: Great for Breakfast or snack
review/text: We normally buy these at Costco and I think they are a little cheaper (maybe a couple of bucks) although the banana walnut bars come packaged WITH the chocolate chip bars so it's sadly double money.. two boxes for $20-25 ish. I love the oatmeal bars but cannot stand the chocolate ones. And I'm a chocolate lover. The chocolate ones taste like healthfood and have a scratchy texture that isn't pleasant to swallow. However, like the banana ones, they do fill you up.<br /><br />The banana walnut bars are healthy (which is most important to me) moist, sweet (but not overpowering) and very dense for their size. So one bar and a cup of coffee fills me up for a breakfast on the go. The cholesterol lowering benefits are a HUGE plus.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars but I feel that the price could be slightly lower for amazon. Based on my Costco experiences I think these should run $12-13 a box -just my personal opinion. If you can't afford $15 for 12 bars then consider making your own and freezing them. I enjoy a recipe for Baked Oatmeal snack bars on the Kath Eats Real food blog, which you will have to google if amazon deletes this link: [...]<br /><br />All-in-all these bars are excellent and convenient as heck. If you don't mind the price and love having them delivered to your door then by all means order them :)

review/summary: sour banana mash, soggy oat squares...
review/text: These banana-walnut oatmeal squares by Corazonas were a colossal disappointment. I'm a dyed-in-the-wool banana bread fan, but there were no similarities here. The texture was slimy, yet gritty and  mealy, with not a walnut in sight. The taste was primarily of oatmeal, with the slightest essence of sourish banana. They were excessively sweet...coming in at fifteen grams of sugar. I wouldn't feed these to a dog, in fact, ours took a bite and turned up her nose. She does have her standards, after all! Fortunately for us all, we had some 'Beggin' Strips standin' by for appeasement purposes. Please know that I'm not a picky eater...I've had SOS countless times and enjoyed it...but, I couldn't abide these hideous things.

review/text: I usually do not write reviews, but when something is this good i have to tell someone.  I cannot say enough good things about these.  The entire bag only has 660 calories, so when you eat one serving there are a lot of them, and if you cant stop at just one serving, you dont feel so bad.  They are gluten free, great for us celiacs, but another plus for anyone.  The spice on them is just enough of a kick, my kids love them, so they arent too spicy, otherwise they would run screaming, they have a more sensitive tounge to spicy foods.  I found these at a local organic store and started picking up 3 bags every 2 weeks.  Now I order them from amazon in bulk, they are cheaper.

I don't take advantage of the QR code identifier (to see which specific fields the product comes from), but it's a nice touch, and builds my trust in Palouse, the manufacturer.<br /><br />Palouse is now my preferred option for both these garbanzo beans and brown lentils.<br /><br />Also: I have found one pebble going through 7.5 Lbs of beans--this is a very good ratio, and means they properly sift through their beans before packaging them.

review/text: Upon receiving the product, I started a batch soaking to get them ready to cook. I soaked the beans overnight and cooked them up in the pressure cooker (after watching Good Eats episode on garbanzos/chickpeas). I am very happy with the quality of the beans. The cooked up tender and tasty. I used some in a soup, added some to a couple of salads and blended the rest up to make hummus. Each time I reflected on how much better I liked them over canned beans (even when cooked unsalted) and the last batch of dried chick peas I bought in the store. The burlap bag is kind of cool and the beans are in a plastic bag inside of that. Out of four cups of measured uncooked beans, I only encountered two beans that did not cook up soft. I will buy these again.

They don't have that "off" taste that some garbanzo beans have. They make the best raw hummus I have ever made. They arrived plastic bag, inside a nice burlap sack. The beans were very clean and I have yet to come across a bad bean.<br /><br />High quality bean, excellent taste. You can't beat the price, and 5 lbs. goes a very long way!<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product.

review/summary: Great Fresh Garbanzo Beans
review/text: I was a little nervous about ordering beans online, but am I glad I did! I make a lot of chick pea stews and hummus and I am amazed by the quality, texture and taste of these beans. If you are tired of canned beans, get these from Palouse and cook them up yourself. You will not be disappointed!

review/summary: I never want to eat canned beans again!
review/text: WOW!  I don't think I've ever had a real fresh garbanzo before because I've never tasted one this good.  I've never worked with dry beans before but this was real easy.  Soak over night and boil for an hour.  Couldn't be easier.  And the taste of these is so amazing, I enjoyed eating them plain, in salads, cooked with a little chorizo, possibilities are endless.  Next I'm going to make hummus with them.  And they are on prime!!  (I LOVE prime!)  So I never have to be without them.  I can't believe I waited so long to try these.<br /><br />As far as the company goes, I had an issue with my whole shipment so I contacted them and they responded in minutes. (excellent customer service).  First I had to contact amazon and then them again if it couldn't be solved.(I know, rookie mistake, contact amazon first)  But of course amazon took care of it with out problem (also excellent customer service).  Things are going to happen and it's comforting to know that if I have an issue it gets taken care of so easily.  I will definitely be ordering these garbanzos and other products from this company through amazon again.  I hope you love them as much as I do!

review/summary: Excellence
review/text: I had been eating, and thoroughly enjoying, Bush brand canned garbanzos as a vegetarian low glycemic index source of protein.  Sometimes my store doesn't have them in stock so I decided to buy dry and cook them myself.  I must say I prefer this way because I have the option of adding salt ot not.  These garbanzos are delicious plain and I often eat them that way.  Especially when I'm just having a couple tablespoons to get me through a hungry patch during the day.  I also add them to my bowls of cooked vegetables, along with olive oil, sea salt, pepper, etc., and nutritional yeast flakes. The garbanzos really round out the meal by adding substance and staying power to the vegetables.  I always make hummus for company and although I haven't made it yet with these garbanzos I have no doubt whatsoever that the hummus will be even better made with fresh beans.  After ordering I received an email from the grower thanking me and providing a link to their website.  To me this was a nice touch and the website is useful.  I found cooking directions there and as someone who can no longer read print I very much appreciate it when I can find directions online.  If you follow their cooking directions you cook one cup of beans and you get 2.5 cups of cooked.  Now I can easily eat 2.5 cups within the three days that they should be used but for calorie control reasons I freeze half of the cooked beans so I can stretch out how many days a batch lasts.  I'm totally happy with these beans and grateful for Amazon as a way to buy quality food I could not otherwise obtain.

review/text: I had never used dried beans before so I was a little apprehensive about buying these, but it turns out they are super simple. I soak them over night in water. I then boil them with salt for about 90mins or until they are very soft. I use them to make hummus with. I use about two cups of cooked beans, 2-3tbs of tahini, 1/3 cup of olive oil, 2tbs of fresh lemon juice, and 3tbs of capers. I know that capers may sound weird but they really do add something. Everyone who eats this hummus loves it. There is also a recipe on Dr. OZ website for chickpea popcorn and that was my intention with these but have yet to get around to making it, but its another way to use these beans if you get tired of hummus. They don't taste anything like canned beans. Its truly amazing how different they taste.

review/text: I dont know that these taste any different than any other dry chic peas, but they do taste great. The main thing for me though is the peace of mind that comes from knowing that they are GMO free. I really dont want any of my money going to Monsanto and their ilk, and would probably forgo chic peas forever if i didnt have that option. That would make me sad, as they are a staple of my diet. Fortunately, i dont have to make that choice.<br />Also, the packaging is appealing. Not a contributing factor in buying these, but nice nonetheless.<br /><br />Enjoy!

When we moved to MN 20 years ago I was able to find it in stores here but in the last couple of years it has been unavailable. I have requested the stores start carring it again, to no avail. I was so excited to learn I could order it through Amazon and did. One hint, I sift out all the dried onion flakes before I add the remaining spices to the tomato paste. I prefer to sprinkle fresh green onion over the homemade cheese covered Enchiladas or Chili Rellenos along with a couple of dollops of sour cream and 2 or 3 olives.<br /><br />Wonderful!

review/summary: Tastes good but separates out
review/text: I read various reviews and plumped for this brand. It tastes as I had expected, but unless you drink it all quickly, the mixture separates out and you need to shake it back together, and it still has a granular texture to it, not smooth like I had hoped. Anyone recommend a better one?

review/summary: Close to being home made
review/text: Pretty good product, especially for being a concentrate. A friend had brought into work some home made horchata using his families recipe and let me try it. I tested our friendship by drinking most of it. That was the first time I had tried horchata. Well I had been hooked and wanted to get some for home. I ordered 2 bottles of this concentrate. The first bottle I used water, the second 1% milk. I definitely recommend using milk. It was very close to being home made. Needs to be stirred every time before pouring. But the taste was there. Shipping was quick. Slightly pricey. Will order again when I need a fix.

review/text: This thing might be 5"-7" however the fact that its the size of a pencil round is beyond ridiculous. I spent $6 more on one for my larger dog and that was well worth the money, this little thing was worth about half I paid. Buyer beware, the photos shown are of their larger bones, they just use them with the smaller ones to make it seem like your getting your moneys worth!! There is no way a 40lb dog would get real use out of this, maybe a 5lb dog!! What a joke!!

review/text: I have an eight-month old Boston terrier puppy, so I will admit that she is probably much smaller than most dogs using this toy--but she is a CHEWER. This is one of the few toys that lasts more than a day for her! She loves it, and is always gnawing it at. It gets smaller, but so far I've found no sharp pieces or large chunks that could be a choking hazard.

I feel comforted in knowing that they are not chewing and ingesting the plastic chew toys (going in the recycle bin) anymore but a natural and humanely produced product.  Although a little on the pricey side for a chew snack - it will last a very long time.

review/summary: Hours and Hours of Chewing Enjoyment!
review/text: My miniature Golden Retriever looks like he is making love with this thing. It's so funny to watch him chew and massage it with care.  He's my service dog, so I appreciate a healthy, non messy treat that keeps him boredom free while I get through my day . I'm a Soldier and can eaily slide this in my trouser pocket and carry it on the go.  I tried local sstore versions and wasted my money - bleached white with no flavor.  I can take the CHASING OUR TAILS brand and boil with a buillon cube for 6 minutes to soften a bit; then pull back the harder exterior with needle nose pliers to expose more marrow for more hours of chewing.  A subsription is the only  way to go.  My dog's teeth are gleaming WHITE and his breath is pleasant. He should be in commercials to prove how important it is for dogs to chew. I will send Chasing our tails a picture of his teeth when I get time.

review/summary: A good option for a "power chewer"
review/text: My dog eats raw meat.  She powers through anything I give her in less than 10 minutes, even meat with bone, which means she doesn't get her teeth as clean as they could be if she took more time.  I bought this product to give her more chewing time.<br /><br />When I first took it out of the package, she responded with interest, but then when I handed the antler to her, she seemed to lose interest, as if she didn't know quite what to do with it.  Eventually she took it outside and buried it.  The next night she brought it back in, and I took it away and put it in water (advice I got from others) to soften it and release some of the flavor.<br /><br />After that, she was more interested and will now gnaw and gnaw on the antler, and lick the marrow.  I limit her time with it in case she chews hard enough to break a tooth.  She started with the wider end of the antler.<br /><br />The product looks almost exactly like the photo.  It is about 7" long and a good size for a small to medium dog with strong jaws (we have a Jack Russell terrier).

review/text: The items came well packaged and in a timely manner.  I am giving it 2 stars because out of the package it had dirt and what smelled like animal excrement on it.  I cleaned it twice before giving it to my dog.  The rack was almost completely black out of the package and after cleaning it myself it was the light brown that they normally are....but it has still retained the bad odor.  My dog is hesitant to use it because of the bad smell.  I have ordered other elk racks before and just be forewarned that this company does not clean the rack before shipment.  Other companies do.  I did not purchase this expecting to have to clean the dirt and animal excrement off it.  I'll be purchasing my next one (which is probably very soon since my dog won't touch this one) from another company.

I hope Amazon someday has the 12 each of the 16 ounce bags of this type of noodles with free shipping. That would be really nice. These are great noodles. No regrets here.
